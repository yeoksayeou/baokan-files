### The National Assembly Holds Its Seventh Meeting: Listens to Financial, Economic, and Grain Reports; Economic and Political Reviews to Be Combined Today

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] The National Assembly held its seventh meeting at 9:25 AM on the 13th, with 173 representatives in attendance. The ninth group of the presidium was on duty, with Chairman He Yingqin presiding. After the minutes of the previous meeting were approved, the presidium reported on three matters: (1) the list of members of the Representative Eligibility Review Committee; (2) a temporary motion by 33 representatives, including Zhang Fang from Henan, requesting the continuation of the military review that was not completed on the 12th. The presidium decided that, before the agenda was changed, the economic report and review would proceed as scheduled on that day, and the military review would be continued at a later date; (3) motions from representatives of Henan and Shandong provinces, respectively, urging the rapid deployment of large reinforcements to aid Hubei and Bian (Kaifeng), as well as Changyi and Weifang, have been forwarded by the presidium to the Ministry of National Defense, and a special representative has been dispatched to report to Chairman Chiang. Subsequently, Chairman He announced the commencement of the economic report. However, representatives from Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, Henan, and the Northeast regions expressed strong objections to the second item in the presidium's report, arguing that North China was in imminent danger and that military matters were of paramount importance during the suppression of the rebellion. They insisted that no other items could be discussed before the military review was completed. The representatives from North China were highly emotional, and representatives from Henan even threatened to walk out. Although the presidium reported that the motion had been approved by a majority of representatives, the order remained chaotic. Fortunately, Zhang Fang, Xue Dubi, Zhang Zhenlu, and others strongly劝advised everyone, and a decision was made that the presidium would immediately hold a meeting to discuss changing the agenda. The public anger gradually subsided. At 10:15 AM, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun finally stood at the podium for the fourth time to begin his financial report. Yu stated that China's economic foundation was inherently weak, and that after the victory, everything needed to be rebuilt. The necessary expenditures for demobilization and suppressing the rebellion were extremely high. In terms of finance, besides minimizing emissions and increasing tax revenues as much as possible, the government would also use US$463 million in aid to stabilize prices and recover legal tender. Regarding the general situation of governance, he reported on four points: (1) Although the revenue and expenditure of the national treasury were difficult to match, the percentage of deficit was still less than the usual 30% before the war. (2) Tax reform would focus on direct taxes, and the improvement of income tax collection methods was expected to be effective. Regarding customs duties, new tax regulations suitable for domestic and foreign conditions would be formulated under the principle of not abandoning protective policies to increase tax revenue. Smuggling issues would also be strictly prevented and eliminated with cooperation from Hong Kong and Macau. The salt tax rate has been increased to 450,000 yuan per dan, which is more than 100,000 times higher than before the war. Currently, in order to increase tax revenue, production and sales loans are being promoted. In addition to requesting the Ministry of National Defense to pay attention to the security of Changlu, Huaihai, and other producing areas, efforts are being made to promote increased production in the coastal areas of South China. These three taxes and the commodity tax are the central government's main sources of revenue, but they are far from sufficient to meet the needs, and they have been greatly damaged during the war to suppress the rebellion. (3) The implementation of financial measures will be based on the principle of cooperating with finance. Loans will still be limited to production-related enterprises, and efforts to crack down on speculation and illegal operations will continue to actively reduce idle funds and stabilize the market. Regarding the total amount of legal tender issued, he guaranteed that it had not reached 70 trillion as of the end of last month. The government is currently selling enemy and puppet assets to strengthen the foundation of legal tender. Regarding the impact of the fluctuating exchange rate mechanism adopted to encourage exports on prices, measures are being planned to improve the situation. (4) A separate revenue and expenditure system has been established for local finance, which is expected to enrich local financial resources. Yu's report lasted 40 minutes. At 10:55 AM, the report was completed, and Chairman He announced a recess. At 10:20 AM, the meeting resumed. Chairman He reported that the presidium had convened an interim meeting and decided to change the agenda for the afternoon to military review, and the economic review would be combined with the political review on the 14th. If time was insufficient, it would be extended to the morning of the 18th. After this decision was accepted by the audience without objection, the heads of economy, transportation, and food successively made policy reports.

Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian first stated that the economic policy was based on the Economic Reform Plan formulated by the Executive Yuan and passed by the State Council. To cooperate with the suppression of the rebellion and mobilization, the focus of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' work was to assist industry and commerce in increasing production, and to develop international trade to balance foreign income and expenditure, leaning towards administrative aspects and not asking about business. He then mentioned that the increased production of the Huadong and Huainan coal mines had achieved significant results, and that the profits from cotton yarn exports had reached US$30 million. After analyzing the reasons for the skyrocketing prices, he emphasized that suppressing the communist bandits, increasing legal tender reserves, increasing production, and making good use of foreign aid were the main methods of suppressing prices.

Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei reported on the current state of transportation with numbers. There were originally more than 30,000 kilometers of railways, of which 11,000 kilometers in the Northeast had been recovered and 3,000 kilometers were open to traffic. Now only 600 kilometers remain. The railways in the country have been damaged by bandits more than 6,000 times, with a length of more than 5,000 kilometers. Currently, 13,000 kilometers are open to traffic. For the construction of new lines, the main line from Guangzhou Bay to Dihua will be completed in six sections. The Duyun-Guiyang section of the Guizhou-Guangxi line will be open to military transport in the short term. Apart from the 1,600 kilometers of roads already in Xinjiang, there has been no new development in the interior. The current total tonnage of water transport is 1.03 million tons. As for postal and telecommunications services, they have been actively seeking progress in recent years, and have developed greatly compared with the past. The total number of postal items last year reached 100 million, and rural postal services are also making efforts to develop.

Minister of Food Yu Feipeng reported on food administration. Regarding the procurement of military grain, although the actual collection and borrowing were resumed in the 36th year, the huge amount of 40 million city stones was still insufficient. After last autumn, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Anhui and other provinces were disturbed by bandits, and the loss of grain sources was even greater. The quotas of various provinces are difficult to collect in full, and the supply is becoming more difficult. Last winter and this spring, purchases from grain-producing areas were used to make up for the deficit. The allocation and sale of public education grain and people's grain, in addition to the refugee relief being coordinated by the Ministry of Social Affairs, the full allocation and sale of the five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, and Sui has already begun. The adjustment of civil food in various places is also being carried out with the assistance of the Four-Bank Loan. In the future, food administration will seek a path to abundance by increasing production, using foreign grain, and practicing strict economy. At 12:10 PM, the morning meeting was adjourned after Yu's report was completed.

Afternoon Agenda Changes: Continue Military Review

At 3:30 PM, the meeting resumed. According to the agenda changed with the consent of the conference in the morning, the military review continued. Chairman Yu Jiaju announced that the order of requests would be followed, with two representatives from each unit speaking. Liu Yizhou and 16 others successively put forward their opinions on military issues. Liu Yizhou from Henan pointed out that the Central Plains must be secured, and the strength of the national army was insufficient, which was extremely serious. He advocated seizing the time to compile and train 100 or 200 elite divisions in the Jiangnan area to consolidate South China and rescue North China. He Foqing advocated that rewards and punishments should be clearly defined to boost military morale and conform to public opinion. He said: "If General Fu Zuoyi has made achievements, he should be allocated new weapons and equipment, and not just receive empty words of praise. If General Chen Cheng has made mistakes, he should not be allowed to get away with it." Mongolian representative Ji Zhenfu raised the issue of the autonomy of Wangye Temple in Liaobei, and accused the military and political officials in charge of the Northeast takeover of negligence, so that it was impossible to use local armed forces when they wanted to. Zuoke Bagang'er emphasized that the residence of the Mongolian compatriots was the gateway to the northern border of the yuan family. Helping the Mongolian compatriots was precisely to protect the border areas. The government should pay attention to it quickly regardless of territorial divisions, and use the Mongolian compatriots' riding and shooting skills and patriotic enthusiasm to equip them with weapons to ensure their own safety and share the responsibility of national defense. His speech won applause from the audience. Yang Huaifeng and Wang Qian from Shanxi separately stated the importance of the strategic positions of the Linfen and Datong areas, and called for rescue. Dang Jiling and Wang Fan from Shaanxi pointed out that the rampant communist bandits in southern Shaanxi had affected the safety of Guanzhong, and those responsible for combat operations could no longer delay and conceal the situation. Zhang Tifang and Tang Hongye from Chahar reported that Zhangjiakou had been surrounded on all sides, and the nearest bandits were only 25 li away from the city. This was caused by the transfer of the national army stationed in Chahar, the emptiness of defense, and the extraction of all local men, resulting in the inability to defend themselves. Protecting Rehe and Chahar is the only way to protect Ping and Tianjin. The government should fully support Fu Zuoyi in ensuring Zhangyuan. After a recess at 4:45 PM, Liu Guilan and others from Suiyuan continued to plead for Fu, and advocated that Deng Baoshan and Ma Hongkui and other troops who had fought the most vigorously in northern Shaanxi should be allocated new equipment. Liu Rongbo from Jilin pointed out that there were many available civilian forces in the Northeast, but they had not been paid attention to and utilized, which was regrettable and sad. Liu Shougang from Hejiang put forward four points: (1) Equal emphasis should be placed on the Northeast and North China, but the Northeast is more important than North China. (2) Equal emphasis should be placed on national and local armed forces, but local armed forces are more important than national armed forces. (3) Tactics should match strategy. (4) Military affairs should match politics. He also proposed that a telegram of condolence should be sent to Wei Lihuang and Li Hong, who was holding on to Changchun, in the name of the conference. Yu Gui from Hejiang accused the Northeast national army of failing to defend itself and never considering attacking the vital parts of the communist bandits. After An Dongcui Rong severely criticized both Tai Shihui and Chen Cheng, he declared: The two should be responsible for three things: (1) delaying military opportunities, (2) losing the hearts of the people, and (3) manufacturing bandit troops in disguise. He also questioned why Minister Bai's military report did not mention a word about the war in the Northeast, and whether the government would give up the Northeast. Finally, he proposed that the only way out for the Northeast was to start employing Northeasterners to call on the public to restore their hometowns. Han Songnian from Hebei said: The emergency in North China was due to the deterioration of the situation in Northeast China, and Xiong Shi should be fully responsible for the situation in Northeast China. He said: "If such people are given high-ranking officials and generous salaries again, the future of the country will be unthinkable." Kong Fumin from Shandong advocated rectifying the political style and military discipline. All levels of administration should have real power to effectively implement government orders. Factories and schools in the rear should be closely organized to prevent the communist bandits from taking advantage of the situation. Sun Mingji from Rehe said: It is unreasonable for Rehe to be subordinate to two executive offices. The 13th Army is stationed as a lone army. Do the 7.5 million people need or not need a government? By 6:00 PM, two temporary motions were discussed: one was to provide effective measures for suppressing the rebellion, and it was decided that the presidium would hand it over to the secretariat for the government to pay attention to; one was to ask General Director Zhang Lisheng to report on election affairs, and it was decided to hand it over to the presidium to study and handle. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM.

### Representatives from Shanxi and Henan Petition: Demand Grain Transport to Taiyuan and Reinforcements to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng; President Zhang and Others Have Replied Separately

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] More than 80 representatives from Shanxi, including Jin Wendeng, petitioned President Zhang and Ministers Gu Zhenggang and Yu Feipeng after the seventh meeting at around 6:00 PM on the 13th, requesting the rapid transportation of grain to Taiyuan, and a regular supply of grain seeds for emergency relief. Zhang and others told them that the government was extremely concerned about the northern provinces, and that 500 tons of surplus grain from the Executive Yuan would be shipped after the air freight of 42 billion was approved. The later food will be purchased and allocated as relief food after the US aid is allocated and the food is exchanged for money, or grain will be purchased and transported to Taiyuan with central loans. However, the air transport problem must be solved first. This is a difficult problem during the suppression of the rebellion. The representatives were very grateful and hoped that the government could deeply understand the critical situation in Shanxi, show compassion for the suffering of the people, and do its best to help solve various pending problems.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] This National Congress was convened during the period of suppressing bandits and suppressing the rebellion.

### Henan National Army Recovers Tanghe; Communist Bandits Retreat from the Outskirts of Zhengzhou

[This Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 13th] The main forces of the two Chen bandit troops that attacked Zhengzhou have been staying near the southwest 30 li of Zhengzhou and the Rongyang and Fanshui areas, seeing that the national army was prepared in advance. On the evening of the 11th, a small group of bandits once approached the city more than 10 li, but they were driven away by the national army in front. From then on, bandits from all directions seemed to have the intention to retreat.

The Situation in Weixian Gradually Stabilizes; National Army Attacks in Changle

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 13th] On the night of the 12th, the battle for the defense of Weixian became more and more tragic. The sound of artillery fire and killing enveloped the entire city. The center of the battle was still in the north, northwest, and southwest of Weixian. At midnight on the 12th, a part of the communist bandits broke in from the southwest Yuguan and launched a fierce street battle with the defending army. On the morning of the 13th, the defending army bravely counterattacked and finally repelled the bandits who had broken in. On the same night, a part of the communist bandits also broke in from the North Pass, and the battle situation was even more tragic. The 12th regiment of the defending army met the enemy with bayonets and charged more than a dozen times. The situation gradually stabilized, and the remnant bandits were being cleared on the 13th. The national army in Changle has been attacking the bandits on the periphery for days. Under the cover of the air force, the battle results have been brilliant. Two battalions of the 14th and 15th Regiments of the bandits were defeated, and important strongholds such as Wanghuang Temple, Gengjiazhuang, and Qiujiadian in the northeast of the city were captured.

### Chronicles of the National Assembly: Military Matters Take Precedence Over Economic Affairs

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] As battles raged in Northeast China, North China, and the Central Plains, the slogan of "Military Matters First" resurfaced in the National Assembly hall, where constitutional governance was being discussed. Yesterday, the verbal clashes during the military review had not yet been fully vented. This morning, during the economic report, the representatives demanded to continue the military review. Before the economic report could even begin, shouts of "No Report!" resounded throughout the chamber. "Military Matters Take Precedence Over Economic Affairs" was fully demonstrated by the representatives' emotions today. General He Yingqin, recently returned from the United States, chaired today's assembly. Although a seasoned veteran and former Chief of Staff of the eight-year War of Resistance, even he found today's scene difficult to control. He reported that 33 representatives, including Zhang Fang from Henan, had submitted a temporary motion to continue the military review. When the chairman decided to schedule a review, immediate opposition erupted from the upper gallery. Wang Mianzhi and Zhang Bingwu from Chahar took the lead, shouting, "Why won't you let us speak? Minister Bai didn't report on North China yesterday. Does he not want North China anymore?" Like a spring breeze stirring, a pool of still water was instantly rippled. Representatives from Northeast and North China responded from all over the hall. He Yingqin hurriedly explained that the chairman had already accepted the suggestion to continue the review, but today's agenda was the economic report, and the military review had to be postponed. Finance Minister Yu Hongjun still stepped onto the podium. He had just started with, "Today, I am ordered to report on finances. Our country's finances are extremely weak!" when he was immediately drowned out by shouts of "Military review is not finished; no report allowed!" He had no choice but to step down. He Yingqin put the agenda issue to a vote. The brilliant four-color light voting machine flashed, indicating that 163 representatives were in favor of not changing the agenda. The chairman, with a victorious smile, asked Minister Yu to report again, which sparked a round of intense applause in the hall. However, from the back, people shouted, "We want to walk out!" Minister Yu had to shake his head again and retreat from the podium. Half an hour after the meeting began, the upper and lower galleries were shouting as one. Many representatives stood up, seemingly preparing to leave. The chairman asked Minister Yu to report a second time, but this time he was interrupted by Wang Jinwen, a representative from Liaoning. The order of the meeting was almost impossible to maintain. He Yingqin repeatedly struck the gavel. Zhang Fang, Xue Dubi, Zhang Zhenlu, Lin Zigui, and others also ran to the back, earnestly persuading the northern representatives not to leave. After several tens of minutes of chaos, Minister Yu finally took the stage for the fourth time and completed his report. During the ten-minute break, the presidium met and accepted the representatives' opinion that "Military Matters Take Precedence Over Economic Affairs," deciding to continue the military review in the afternoon, allowing the remaining time in the morning for Ministers Chen Qida, Yu Dawei, and Yu Feipeng to each complete their economic reports in fifteen minutes, and moving the economic review to tomorrow.

In the afternoon, after the rain cleared, the representatives used this hard-won time to continue their criticisms of past military measures. Seventeen representatives spoke in succession, and apart from applause, it remained peaceful throughout. After the break, the number of representatives in the hall was sparse, barely reaching a thousand, as if the review had become a "war of attrition." All seventeen speakers were northern representatives, who both reviewed the successes and failures of the military in the north and took precautionary measures for South China. Sun Ming from Jehol reminded everyone to review whether South China had preventive measures against the communists. Many representatives proposed countermeasures to remedy past shortcomings, demanding to arm the troops fighting the communists. Su Ting and Liu Gui from Suiyuan repeatedly pleaded for assistance for Fu Zuoyi, hoping the central government could provide him with superior equipment. "If weapons are given to Commander-in-Chief Fu, he will not give them to the communists." The entire hall immediately erupted in enthusiastic applause. Yan Songnian from Hebei sternly criticized Xiong Shihui for harming the country. In the shouts, calls to overthrow Xiong Shihui were heard. Kong Fumin from Shandong spoke up for Wang Yaowu, saying that he did not even have the power to use county magistrates, which drew sympathy in the hall. The representatives called for clear rewards and punishments. Throughout the afternoon's military review, the merits and demerits of past military leaders were revealed. (April 13th, Nanjing)

### Editorial: Watching the Trends in Siamese Politics

Since the coup d'état in Siam last November, Nai Khuang Aphaiwong has continued to organize a provisional government. It was not until early March of this year that he gained the trust of the House of Representatives and the recognition of the governments of China, Great Britain, the United States, and France. However, after only thirty days, Siam suddenly experienced another coup d'état. Under pressure from the military, Prime Minister Nai Khuang resigned, and the coup leader, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, staged a comeback, taking responsibility for organizing a new cabinet. Although the cabinet selections have been internally decided, they have not yet been finalized. The relationship between China and Siam has once again been plunged into a state of stagnation. However, the relationship between China and Siam is not only related to the economic development of Siam but also to the survival of the 3.5 million overseas Chinese in Siam. This is because Plaek Phibunsongkhram is an extremist who rejects overseas Chinese. He has adopted various unequal laws against our overseas Chinese, suppressing the education of our overseas Chinese, restricting the economic activities of our overseas Chinese, and even promulgated an emergency decree to expel our overseas Chinese. These painful experiences filled with blood and tears make it necessary for us to pay close attention to the dynamics of Plaek Phibunsongkhram's cabinet formation, and we must be especially vigilant about the fate of our 3.5 million overseas Chinese in Siam.

When Plaek Phibunsongkhram met with reporters on the 10th, he also expressed great concern about possible events between China and Siam. He said, "The Siamese government is studying the immigration laws of other countries and other laws to solve the problem of overseas Chinese in Siam." He also admitted that the Chinese do not have a good impression of him, so he is deeply afraid that "a slight mistake may cause unrest." Based on Reuters' simple report, it is not difficult to foresee how the future relationship between China and Siam will develop.

The course of this coup d'état is as follows: April 6th was the 166th anniversary of the founding of the Chakri Dynasty in Siam. While the entire Regency Council was paying respects in front of the statue of King Rama I on the banks of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, a major incident suddenly occurred in the city. A military group, wielding weapons, confronted Prime Minister Nai Khuang Aphaiwong and issued an ultimatum demanding that the government resign and allow a virtuous and talented person to take power. The ultimatum contained eight points, which were abstract and not specific, and focused more on personnel than policies. Nai Khuang did not resist and accepted the resignation. On the 7th, the State Council held a meeting, and Nai Khuang proposed the resignation of the cabinet, which the State Council refused to accept, leading to a deadlock. That afternoon, the Regency Council appointed Plaek Phibunsongkhram to organize a new cabinet, and on the 10th, the new cabinet was largely organized. Nai then asked the Parliament to vote on the new cabinet's confidence on the 15th, and he also asked all countries to recognize the new regime. The attitude of various countries towards this coup d'état in Siam has not yet been expressed, and it is expected that they will quietly observe the internal changes in Siam.

Plaek Phibunsongkhram is the leader of the extremists and the military in Siam. During the Pacific War, he had the reputation of being the "Mussolini of the East" with his dictatorial regime. During his time in power, he was anti-British and anti-American, pro-Axis, anti-Chinese, and advocated "Pan-Thaiism," viewing the Chinese as enemies. After the war, the totalitarian politics of Siam collapsed, and Plaek was once detained but later released. After being dormant for a while, he began to stir again. First, he organized the Conservative Party, intending to make a comeback. However, due to the failure to form a party, he secretly led the military in a bloodless coup d'état on the evening of November 8th last year, overthrowing the government of Luang Thamrongnawasawat. Even the former Prime Minister Pridi Banomyong fled after hearing the news. After the incident, due to pressure from international public opinion, Nai Khuang, the leader of the Democratic Party, was brought out to be responsible for organizing a provisional government, but it was not recognized by various countries. A general election was held on January 29th this year, and a new parliament was established. Nai Khuang won the victory of being elected by the people, overwhelming Plaek Phibunsongkhram's election campaign. Nai Khuang was ordered to form a cabinet on February 20th, and the domestic parliament voted on the confidence on March 5th. On March 6th, various countries recognized it as the legitimate government of Siam.

Therefore, the most noteworthy aspect of this coup d'état is that international factors outweigh domestic factors. Nai Khuang understands this very well, so he is willing to step down voluntarily. The current international situation is moving towards polarization. "Red coups" have gained an absolute advantage in Eastern and Central Europe. Recently, even Czechoslovakia, which is known as the democratic fortress of Eastern and Central Europe, declared the death penalty in a coup d'état overnight. Many people around the world feel uneasy about the red threat. Plaek Phibunsongkhram is a sensitive person. He witnessed the trend of the world situation and believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. Therefore, he used anti-communism as a smokescreen and used force to force the Nai Khuang government to resign. After the coup d'état, Plaek Phibunsongkhram himself also said: "The new government's policy is neither left-leaning nor right-leaning. I personally am an anti-communist." The communist forces in Siam are not very strong, and there is no need to adopt an anti-communist policy in domestic affairs. Isn't the coup d'état just a fuss? Therefore, he thoroughly explained his anti-communist aspirations, and he announced: "The only left-wing color in Siam today is the red flag on the roof of the Soviet Embassy in Bangkok." From this, it can be seen that Plaek Phibunsongkhram's anti-communism is a smokescreen, an excuse, and we must not believe it.

From the above, it is clear that Plaek Phibunsongkhram is using "anti-communism" as a name to fulfill his ambition to seize power. The United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands can see the development of the Siamese coup d'état even more clearly than we do. We hope that the government authorities of various countries will pay special attention to Plaek Phibunsongkhram's political ambitions and must not be fooled and immediately recognize him; otherwise, this coup d'état will become the death knell of Siamese democracy. This requires special caution from our diplomatic authorities. Plaek Phibunsongkhram's government must not be recognized until Plaek Phibunsongkhram guarantees that he will not borrow the corpse to revive the soul and re-establish laws that oppress overseas Chinese. At the same time, in diplomacy, we should actively engage and unite with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands to deal with Plaek Phibunsongkhram, so as to ensure that Siamese democracy is not destroyed, and also to ensure that the lives of our 3.5 million overseas Chinese are effectively protected!

### Taiwan's Electricity Supply Insufficient: Plan to Add Three Power Plants. First Batch of Funds Have Been Negotiated and Contract Signed.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 13th] Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming recently told a group of reporters from Shanghai who arrived in Taiwan on the 12th: "At present, the Sun Moon Lake power plant generates 125,000 kilowatts, while the province's demand is 136,000 kilowatts. Future demand will continue to increase significantly. Relying solely on Sun Moon Lake for power supply is not enough. It is necessary to build three additional power plants: Wulai, Wushe, and Tianleng. After these three power plants are completed, they can generate an additional 120,000 kilowatts, which is estimated to take three years and cost at least 6 million US dollars." Liu Jinyu, general manager of Taiwan Power Company, told a reporter from the Central News Agency: "I went to the United States last spring to borrow 12.7 million US dollars from the US Export-Import Bank and manufacturers for the purpose of repairing and expanding the province's power facilities. I went to Shanghai last month to continue discussing this matter. Now, the first batch of this loan, totaling 2 million US dollars, has been negotiated with Westinghouse Electric Corporation of the United States as a short-term loan, to be repaid in two years, guaranteed by the Central Bank and the Bank of China, and was officially signed in Shanghai on April 1 this year. However, this amount is only for ordering the most urgently needed equipment and transformers to replenish the two power plants in the Sun Moon Lake area."

### Overseas Chinese in Batavia Organize Political Party to Cope with the War Situation in the Dutch East Indies. Zhang Tiancong Elected Chairman of the Preparatory Committee.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 12th] Overseas Chinese here are preparing to organize a political party to seek benefits for the overseas Chinese in Indonesia and the local ethnic minorities.

### Wailing Everywhere in Northern Huai: National Army Cuts Expenses to Provide Relief

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] The excellent cooperation between the military and civilians in the Huaihai Campaign was unprecedented. For example, a battalion of the National Army maintaining traffic at Tihuamiao between Fuyang and Mengcheng, and the entire company guarding Baimiao on the outskirts of Fuyang, were surrounded and dispersed by bandits. All the wounded officers and soldiers and the guns and ammunition that could not be carried were covered and buried by the local people, and they were escorted back to the team after the war. For example, during the war, the residents of Fuyang comforted the officers and soldiers defending the city and handled the supply of military supplies day and night. All of this proves that the people of Northern Huai have done their best in providing great and noble labor to the National Army. At the same time, they were also deeply hated by the bandits. The bandits burned, killed, looted, and plundered on the outskirts of Fuyang. Now, there are no complete walls in the houses 40 li inside and outside Fuyang, and hundreds of thousands of refugees in Fuyang, Taihe, Linquan, and other counties have no homes to return to. The wails are everywhere, and it is heartbreaking. The local National Army is launching a campaign for officers and soldiers to donate rice, and is cooperating with the local government to provide emergency relief.

### Field Property Dispute Filial Son Murders Father

Criminal Zhou Wende Escorted to Qingpu

[Our Newspaper 12th Dispatch] A case of a direct son murdering his own father occurred on the 4th in Dongzhoujiao, Erbao, Zhaotun Town. The criminal Zhou Wende fled to Shanghai after the incident but was still captured. The details are as follows: Zhou Boyun, a resident of the area, is 76 years old, thrifty, and has considerable assets. His eldest son, Wende, and second son, Wude, had already separated their households. Wude passed away ten years ago, leaving behind a posthumous son named Bingzhong, who was greatly favored by his grandfather, causing Wende dissatisfaction.

### New Look of Humen Fortress

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Liang Feng

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 11th Airmail] If we travel by water from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, going south along the Pearl River, after traveling about half the distance, the muddy yellow river water will gradually turn碧green. A natural boundary line is drawn between the yellow and green colors. This is the end of the lower reaches of the Pearl River. There, we will discover a strait, surrounded by mountains on both sides resembling dragons coiling and tigers crouching. A gap is exposed in the middle. This is the Humen Fortress, which guards the throat of the Pearl River and is the gateway to South China. It stands opposite Hong Kong and Macau outside the mouth of the Pearl River, and its situation is very dangerous. Since the eighth year of Shunzhi during the Qing Dynasty, troops have been stationed there for defense. It has been through the Opium War and the War of Resistance Against Japan, giving the enemy a great blow, which shows its value in military geography. The "doorkeeper" guarding this national gate now is the Humen Fortress Command.

Small Patrol Boat Five Hours

We obtained the consent of the Fortress Command in advance to visit this historic fortress. We took a small patrol boat from the Naval Fourth Base Command, sailing against the wind and waves for five hours. We were already forty nautical miles away from Guangzhou. That was Taiping Town, Dongguan County, where the Humen Fortress Command is located. We abandoned the boat and went ashore. Although the town only had two main streets, the noise of restaurants, teahouses, and theaters, and the bustling crowds on the streets were very lively. This place is sixty Chinese miles away from Dongguan County and can also be directly reached from Hong Kong by land. The transportation is very convenient, so commerce is also very prosperous. Taiping Park in the town is the place where revolutionary martyr Zhu Zhixin died in the past. There is now a monument erected, and next to the monument is the "Zhixin Memorial Hospital," both built by later generations to admire the martyrs. Looking north from there, not far away, there is a large village called Humen Village. It is said that there were originally more than a thousand houses, but they were all destroyed by the enemy during the occupation.

Massive Forts Speaking

Taiping Town is only the command center of the Humen Fortress. All the forts are located more than ten miles away at the estuary. The more famous ones are "Shajiao", "Dajiao", "Xiansheng", "Weiyuan", "Suilei" and other forts. The largest of these is "Shajiao", which is sixteen Chinese miles away from Taiping Town. That place is where Lin Zexu burned opium in the past. There is now a "Lin Gong Zexu Memorial Tablet" standing tall and dry by the sea for people to pay their respects. Next to it are several abandoned cannons lying on the ground. One of them is more than two feet long and is said to be a product of the Krupp factory in Germany. However, the changes of the times and the advancement of science have made it an ancient cannon that is only suitable for people to appreciate. Behind the monument is the "Coastal Platform", with stone steps to climb. After passing through a winding and gloomy tunnel, you come out to the fort, and further up is the pointing post. The terrain there is higher, and several houses are built under the shade of green trees, backed by mountains and facing the sea. The environment is quiet. If it weren't for the massive cannons all around, it would be easy to think of it as a villa hanging on the corner of the sea.

Natural Fortress Locks Heavy Door

Looking at the overall map of Humen's terrain, it is as if there are several small doors inside a large door. "Shajiao" and "Dajiao" face each other, like a pair of crab claws. This is the outermost gate. Going in, there are also Lower Hengdang, Upper Hengdang, Dahushan, Xiaohushan, and other inner gates. If the heavy doors are deeply locked, the enemy will indeed not cross the pond half a step, so it is said to be a natural fortress. It is a pity that after the occupation, because the Japanese often occupied Hong Kong, they believed that Humen had lost its military value. They completely removed the heavy cannons above the fortress, and thoroughly destroyed the rest, turning the fortress into wasteland. We only restored it after victory. The Fortress Command was restored on June 6, 1946. On the one hand, it organized and trained troops and built barracks. On the other hand, it sent personnel to Wuhan, Xiamen, Hainan Island and other places to receive and transport the sent cannons. This work was quite difficult, and they were praised by their superiors for their hard work. After Song Ziwen took charge of Guangdong, he attached great importance to this national defense fortress. Recently, he has obtained approval from the central government to approve the department to increase the establishment of the Third Garrison Battalion, a Fortress Artillery Platform, and add seven radar sets, which will make the fortress's equipment more complete.

Garrison and Pacification Combined

The jurisdiction of the Humen Fortress is quite large, including Dongguan and Binan counties, divided into: (1) the Fortress Main Area (with the headquarters' current location as the center within a radius of 30 Chinese miles), (2) the Forward Fortress Area (Tangjiawan, Qi'ao, Lingding Island to Nantou area), (3) the Joint Fortress (Daya Bay area), and other three major areas. Their jurisdiction is vast, so in addition to "garrison", they also have to undertake pacification work. In March last year, they were ordered to undertake the pacification tasks of Zhongshan, Shunde, Dongguan, and Baoan counties. In November of the same year, because the communist bandits set up checkpoints on the north bank of Dapeng Bay to collect taxes, thereby enriching their funds and expanding their strength, they were also dispatched to sweep away the bandits and assist the customs in restoring the checkpoints. They achieved the expected results in each operation and were awarded a commendation and merit by the Ministry of National Defense.

Coastal Major Fortress Plan

Director Song of the Provisional Headquarters believes that the Shenzhen Station at the junction of Guangdong and Hong Kong is important. Recently, he ordered Zhang Zongliang, the Commander of the Fortress, to be stationed in Shenzhen to unifiedly command the local military, police, and military police to ensure local safety. This task is even more important.

In addition, they also have a plan to establish the Humen Fortress as a new type of coastal major fortress, abolishing the past "closed type" and adopting the "expanded type", and re-determining the location of the artillery. This plan has recently been approved by the Ministry of National Defense and is being constructed step by step. In the near future, our southern gate will certainly be more consolidated.

[United Dabo Goda 13th Electric] US Secretary of State Marshall issued a statement to other national representatives attending the Pan-American Conference last night, stating that the situation here is the same type of event that has caused strikes in France and other countries and attempts to obstruct the Italian elections. When we take action here, we must understand that this is a global event, not limited to Colombia or Latin America. Among the national representatives, Marshall was the first to openly attribute this revolution to world communism, and indirectly to Moscow. Marshall believes that the Communist Party deliberately instigated the revolution in order to disrupt the Pan-American Conference, entrap the Western world, and affect the Italian elections. National representatives decided to hold a meeting to discuss this issue and are expected to formally pass it today.

[Reuters Bogota 12th Electric] The Pan-American Conference continued to be held in Bogota, and the United States has been working hard to complete the Pan-American Organization Convention and pass a resolution condemning communism and expressing its determination to ban it, in order to show the world the unity of Pan-America. Although the tense situation in Bogota has eased, attacks still occur from time to time, and commerce is still at a standstill. The area controlled by the army has gradually expanded, the city is still short of food, and the bodies on the streets have gradually been cleared. Due to the implementation of martial law, almost every level of life in the city is under the control of the army, and pedestrians on the streets are searched by the army from time to time. The area around the Pan-American Conference venue is forbidden to pass by idle people. Foreign journalists estimate that since this incident, the total number of deaths has reached 500, and the property loss in Bogota has reached 10 million US dollars.

### Stalin on Soviet-Finnish Relations

Saying that Large and Small Countries Can Be Equal

[Our Newspaper News] London 13th Broadcast: Moscow News, Stalin expressed his opinion when he hosted the Finnish delegation on April 7, saying that if there is sufficient time and continuous efforts, suspicion between countries can be eliminated. This opinion reveals a glimmer of hope for reducing suspicion between East and West. According to Stalin, since expressing his views on international issues during his meeting with Stetson last year, he has remained silent, and this is the first time he has expressed his views.

[Reuters London 13th Electric] Moscow Radio today first published Marshal Stalin's speech at the signing of the Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty on April 8, saying that most politicians in powerful countries despise small countries with an arrogant attitude, but only the Soviet Union recognizes the Soviet-Finnish treaty as a treaty between two equal countries. Stalin said: "This treaty is a turning point in the relations between the two countries. For 150 years, there has been mutual distrust between Russia and Finland. I sincerely hope that the two countries can abandon the long-term distrust of the past from now on and enter a new relationship of mutual trust. The treaty signed between the two countries must break this distrust and establish a new foundation for relations between the two nations. We hope that everyone here today, as well as others in Finland and the Soviet Union, can understand this. Many people do not believe that equal relations can be established between large and small countries, but only the Soviet people believe that such relations can exist. The Soviet people believe that all countries, regardless of size, have their own characteristics that other countries cannot have. Therefore, all countries should be equal, so although Finland is a small country, the Soviet Union still regards it as an equal country and signs a treaty with it."

### US Miner Strike Ends

### Sixteen Western European Countries Meeting in Paris on Friday The Five-Nation Alliance Treaty Issue Is Also on the Agenda

[Associated Press London 13th Electric] A British Foreign Office spokesman confirmed on the 13th that representatives of the five Western countries that signed the Western European Alliance Treaty will discuss the implementation of the treaty in Paris on the 16th. He said that the Foreign Office has not yet been able to explain the nature of the new Western European alliance to be held. The details of this issue and the agenda are currently being negotiated through diplomatic channels.

He said that Foreign Secretary Bevin will leave for Paris on the evening of the 15th, but this does not mean that the meeting will be at the level of foreign ministers, because other foreign ministers may not attend the meeting. Foreign Secretary Bevin will return to London on the 24th.

[Reuters Berlin 12th Electric] When the foreign ministers of the sixteen countries hold a conference here on Friday, it is believed that Bevin and Bidault will take this opportunity to discuss the Soviet Union's recent actions in Berlin. London has recently become increasingly convinced that the Soviet Union intends to force the Western powers to withdraw from Berlin, but the new actions taken by the Soviet Union in Berlin and Vienna over the weekend have not been overly valued by British officials. Rumors that the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will immediately hold a meeting to discuss Soviet actions have also been solemnly denied by the British and French foreign ministries.

[News from Our Newspaper] New York, 13th Broadcast: Washington News, Air Force Secretary Symington told the House Armed Services Committee today that the Soviet Union is building the world's largest air force, exceeding the United States by twelve times in military aircraft, aiming to determine victory in the air against the United States. Symington urged the passage of a plan to establish seventy air force groups, saying that the United States must win in the air, as it cannot compete with the Soviet Union in land forces. It is said that the Soviet Union currently has one hundred army divisions, and its satellite countries also have seventy-five divisions.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The House Armed Services Committee debated the conscription bill fiercely. Defense Secretary Forrestal, who attended to present his views today, strongly stated that peace could be achieved if the United States could straightforwardly express its determination not to tolerate the destruction of Western civilization in Europe. This is not a peace obtained through a long-term war of attrition, but a peace created by giving aggressors advance warning. Forrestal emphasized the need for a strong air force and army to protect bases, a large navy to maintain maritime traffic, and a central intelligence agency. Forrestal also told the committee that, according to Dr. Bush, chairman of the Atomic Energy Research and Development Board, the Soviet Union already possesses the scientific knowledge and procedures to manufacture atomic bombs, but lacks the industrial capacity to do so.

The conference also passed resolutions allowing governments to punish newspapers that publish the following types of news through fines or restrictions: (1) Documents related to national security that must be kept secret; (2) Texts that infringe on others' copyrights; (3) Texts that damage others' reputations and are harmful to the public.

[Reuters, Geneva, 12th] The United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press today discussed France's proposal to authorize governments to respond to false reports published abroad.

### Czech Election Postponed

[United Press, Prague, 13th] The Czech government has decided to postpone the general election by one week.

### US Senators Jointly Demand Amendment of the UN Charter; Abolish Veto Power, Establish International Military

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Republican Senator Ferguson recently submitted a resolution to the Senate requesting an immediate amendment to the United Nations Charter as "a new response to the Soviet Union." The resolution has been supported by sixteen senators from fourteen states and calls for the abolition of the veto power in the Security Council on issues such as aggression, preparation for aggression, and applications for new member states to join the United Nations. The resolution also proposes the establishment of an international police force, with an international unit as a standing army and the troops of the other five powers as reserve forces. The standing army would be composed entirely of volunteers from small countries.

[Central News Agency, Success Lake, 12th] United Nations observers point out that major leaders of American foreign policy, such as Marshall and Vandenberg, are opposed to amending the Charter, and most UN officials are deeply concerned that any proposal by Congress to fundamentally alter the world organization, even if unsuccessful, will lead to the rapid disintegration of the United Nations. Although the views of the seventeen senators may clearly represent a strong trend, there is currently very little chance of them being adopted by Congress.

### General Chennault on US Policy Toward China

(18) The Last Year of Wartime Cooperation

The situation in our last year of wartime cooperation with China after General Stilwell was recalled in 1944 finally proved that there were reasonable and effective ways to deal with President Chiang and his government.

Before General Wedemeyer succeeded Stilwell as theater commander, those who defended Stilwell always said that the situation in China required Stilwell's old methods of "pleading, condemning, and treating rudely," but these methods were not considered necessary for Stilwell's successor, and in my opinion, they became necessary for Stilwell because of his prejudices.

I believe that the entire unfortunate record of the theater command under Stilwell can make it a glorious chapter in Sino-American relations. I especially believe that the tragedy of eastern China in 1944 could have been avoided with the materials he had at his disposal at the time.

When the fate of Guilin and Liuzhou—and therefore the fate of eastern China—was determined by the Japanese offensive, the theater command reluctantly allowed only 500 tons of supplies to be given to the defenders of the two cities. This was the first and last direct assistance to Chinese ground forces during Stilwell's tenure, and it came so late that it further illustrates his previous shortcomings.

Wedemeyer's method completely proved this point. During the remaining period of Sino-American wartime cooperation, Wedemeyer handled relations with the central government on a basis of mutual respect, which alleviated much of the damage caused in 1942–44.

He buried the previous hostile relationship between the theater command and the Chinese leaders. In addition, he buried the previous open encouragement of the Chinese Communist Party during the remaining period of the war against Japan. But our strange attitude of encouraging the CCP was later revived and gradually died out in 1947 and 1948.

For those who might argue that Wedemeyer did not face similar problems to those faced by Stilwell after the loss of eastern China, it is worth pointing out that the Japanese offensive launched in the summer of 1945 against Zhijiang, one of our forward air bases in Hunan Province, caused similar difficulties.

The Chinese ground forces actually engaged in combat at that time were not trained or equipped by the Americans, but they received emergency assistance when the Japanese offensive began. The ground forces were heavily dependent on air supply, but this time they received air supply to the maximum extent.

In short, Wedemeyer decided that Zhijiang must be defended. He gained the confidence of the Chinese leadership rather than shaking their confidence. He helped the ground forces gain vitality and guided them, but did not want to gain command.

As a result, the Japanese army was defeated or driven out, and Zhijiang was saved. Although the New Sixth Army, trained and equipped by the United States and with outstanding achievements in Burma, was airlifted to Zhijiang as a reserve force, there was no need to participate in combat.

But this new relationship with China came too late, and Washington was already prejudiced against China. Otherwise, I am sure that our post-war policy toward China would never have advocated the Chinese Communist Party joining the Nanjing government.

I feel that Secretary of State Marshall's post-war attitude toward the China issue was largely influenced by Stilwell's reports. His efforts in arbitration unwittingly fell into the trap of the Chinese Communist Party and aggressive international communism.

I believed this at the time, and subsequent developments have proven this point.

Stilwell's "open flirtation" with the Chinese Communist Party was never more clear than in an event that occurred nine months after he left China.

In July 1945, about a month before the final collapse of Japan, Stilwell, who was then commander of the US Tenth Army on Okinawa, proposed a plan to directly assist the Chinese Communist Party, which attracted considerable attention in Washington, and the result was that it was forwarded to Wedemeyer for his opinion.

I had already retired and was no longer commander of the Fourteenth Air Force and was resting in Chongqing, so I learned about this matter.

In short, Stilwell's suggestion was that the Tenth Army should land on the coast of Jiangsu Province north of Shanghai to make contact with the Chinese Communist army, give the Communist Party American arms and ammunition, and let them attack Shanghai, which was occupied by the Japanese army.

This proposal secretly caused a commotion in Chongqing, perhaps including an emergency protest from the central government, and as a result, it was not implemented. It goes without saying that having the Communist Party occupy Shanghai at the end of the war was tantamount to handing over the heartland of China, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, to the Communist Party.

In our past ten years of relations with China, we have traveled a perilous road. The difficulties have not passed, but I believe we have crossed the crossroads and made the right choice. With proper guidance, Americans know how to find the right path.

But we have indeed suffered irreparable losses, the most important of which is time. History seems to be telling us, like a stern teacher, whether we have delayed for too long. (The End)

### US Naval Air Transport Squadron Suffers First Accident; Transport Plane Crashes and Burns in Jiangwan; Right Engine Malfunctions After Takeoff, Touching Ground and Catching Fire; Fifteen Injured, Including Pilot and Naval Personnel

[News from Our Newspaper] A US Naval Air Transport Squadron C46 twin-engine transport plane, carrying 25 people including US naval personnel and the pilot, took off from Shanghai for Qingdao at around 12 noon yesterday. About ten minutes after taking off from Jiangwan Airport, the right engine malfunctioned. The plane immediately turned back to the airport. As it approached the runway, the malfunctioning engine stopped running, forcing it to land in a field about half a kilometer west of the airport. After the plane touched the ground, it immediately caught fire. The pilot and passengers opened the emergency door on the plane and jumped out one after another in the nick of time. Fortunately, there were no deaths, except for fifteen people who suffered minor and serious injuries.

After the accident, the nearby 101st Rear Hospital of our army witnessed the scene and immediately sent people with stretchers to bandage and provide first aid to the injured. Upon receiving the news, the US Marine Corps immediately dispatched ambulances to the scene of the accident to transport the injured to the US Naval Hospital for treatment. At the same time, fire trucks were dispatched to extinguish the flames in the plane. Because there was a ditch nearby, a Yonglong leather belt was used. After an hour or so of firefighting, the smoke and fire were completely extinguished.

When reporters arrived at the scene of the accident, the fuselage was still smoking. The plane crashed about 30 yards east of the Tianle Temple behind the 101st Rear Hospital, located west of Yixian Road and north of Min Road. The fuselage was blue-gray in color, with the number A29, 39512. The nose, right engine, and abdomen of the fuselage were completely destroyed, and the right wing was also broken. According to eyewitnesses, when the plane made a forced landing, it broke a utility pole in the farmland, splitting the power lines. The pilot rushed south towards Tianle Temple, but fortunately, the engine hit the ground 30 yards away, and at the same time made a sharp turn, changing from south to north and stopping, otherwise Tianle Temple would have been destroyed.

The names of the injured pilot and passengers are listed below, as investigated: Pilot Kempson, Co-pilot Bagley, Navigator Lopes, Radio Operator Jenkins, Marine Corps members Louse, Cohen, Kepiel, Genny, Joly, Johnson, Coates, Kim, Cocklan, Black, and Coper, totaling fifteen people. Although their injuries range in severity, none are life-threatening. According to US Navy personnel, this is the first accident in the two years of activity of the Naval Air Transport Squadron.

Another report: When the plane crashed and caught fire, Wang Yongyan, the training director on duty at the 101st Rear Hospital, immediately led medical and nursing staff and guards with stretchers to the scene of the plane crash. While dispatching troops to guard the surrounding area, they rushed to the plane to do their best to rescue. At that time, only the right wing of the plane was on fire, and the flames were fiercely approaching. A person in the plane jumped out of the window and accidentally landed in the fire. In a critical situation, Medical Director Pan Liren, Director of the Second Sanatorium Li Shengqing, and others bravely rescued him from the fire. Because of heavy bleeding from the head, they immediately administered first aid and rescued other injured people separately. Soon, air force ambulances also arrived and took the injured people to the hospital for treatment.

[News from Our Newspaper] In the case of dancers and employees of the dance industry disrupting the Social Affairs Bureau during a petition, the family members of the arrested dancers Hong Xiaoping and others filed a petition with the District Court requesting a retrial to maintain the rule of law and respect human rights because the dancers had been detained in the police station for too long. The District Court received two petitions, one filed by 37 family members of the dancers Hong Xiaoping, Tang Meiyun, and Feng Aina, and the other filed by the family members of the employees Hong Zhenbang, Su Guanlin, Han Yongbao, and Chen Feilong. After receiving the petitions, the District Court summarily rejected them because the case was being handled by the Special Criminal Court. According to Zhou Yizhi, the lawyer handling the case, the Special Criminal Court handles cases of communist bandits. If the police investigation of the case cannot prove that there is any suspicion of communist bandits, why is it being transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial? This is truly puzzling.

### Continued Implementation of Labor Relief; Second Phase of Measures Prepared

### Fisheries Dispute Unresolved, Private Sector Representatives Raise Questions, Regarding the Fisheries Management Office's Administration as Improper

Director of Fisheries Management Office Receives Reporters, Responds to Various Points Raised by the Fisheries Industry

[Report from our newspaper] The dispute between the Fisheries Rehabilitation Material Management Office and the private fisheries industry has been protracted for a long time and has not been resolved. Recently, the private fisheries sector has further dispatched representatives to Beijing to petition the National Assembly, and it is also heard that they will file a lawsuit against the Huai Management Office in accordance with the law. According to representatives of the private fisheries industry, the crux of this dispute lies in the fact that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Chinese government initially had a basic agreement that all donated goods would be subject to a plan proposed by the Chinese government, and UNRRA would jointly purchase and transport them to China with Chinese representatives in accordance with the plan. The current Deputy Director of the Fisheries Management Office, Wang Yikang, was one of the fisheries technicians sent to UNRRA. All UNRRA's aid to China's fisheries materials were purchased by UNRRA experts, Mr. Messer, and Wang in accordance with the plan of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

UNRRA Has No Right to Interfere

As for these materials, they are divided into two types: those used for rehabilitation are distributed to the people without compensation, and those used for relief are charged a reasonable fee, but the fees collected should still be used for the same department's rehabilitation undertakings. For example, shipbuilding timber belongs to the former, while fishing vessels have both rehabilitation and relief properties. The right to distribute these materials rests entirely with the administrative agencies; UNRRA has no right to interfere in the administration of the Fisheries Management Office, which belongs to the Chinese government, especially after the rehabilitation materials were released to the public. Now that UNRRA has ended its operations and has no representatives in Shanghai, the Fisheries Management Office often claims that everything is done in accordance with UNRRA's orders, and that the office has no right to distribute, which is indeed inappropriate.

Equipment is Left to Rot

Moreover, the office sells fishery supplies at high prices, and valuable machinery and fishing gear are left to rot. Fishing vessels are not allocated under the guise of supervision, making it even more difficult to shirk its responsibility. Last year, Chairman Shen of Zhejiang Province prepared funds and requested to receive timber to build fishing boats. The Farmers Bank automatically allocated 30 billion yuan the year before last, requesting to build ships. Last year, the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration automatically allocated 10,000 tons of flour to build ships for fishermen. However, the office transported more than 40,000 tons of timber to other ports and handed them over to branch offices for safekeeping. It neither built ships itself nor handed the timber over to local governments. All of the above facts have caused great impact to the private fisheries industry, so it resolutely raised public questions to the Fisheries Management Office.

On the other hand, Zhao Junmai, director of the Fisheries Management Office, held a special reception for reporters at the Licha Building at 5 pm yesterday, accompanied by Deputy Director Xia Yikang, the chief secretary, and the head of the material group, to answer the various points raised by the private fisheries industry and the questions asked by reporters.

Not a Single Piece of Timber is Moldy

(1) Types of materials and their handling: (A) Timber: A total of 25,000 tons arrived, worth more than 700,000 US dollars. In addition to the amount used and transported to Tianjin and other places, there are still more than 23,000 tons in storage, and not a single piece is moldy. As for building wooden boats, the sovereign right has indeed been transferred to our country, but initially there was a lack of funds, and it was planned to prepare funds from the Farmers Bank. However, UNRRA believed that it was not necessary and could be paid with American cotton funds. However, when requesting the collection of funds, both the Farmers Bank and the Executive Yuan reported their completion.

Sovereignty of Fishing Vessels Still Belongs to UNRRA

(B) Hemp Rope: Actually received 15,000 [units], more than 1,000 rolls were used in the past year, and more than 1,000 rolls were stored in Qingdao to be distributed to private fishermen. After investigation, it was confirmed that more than 2,000 rolls were moldy, but it was not the responsibility of the Fisheries Management Office. These hemp ropes were surplus materials from the US Navy. They had been stored for a long time before being transported to Shanghai, and mold had already occurred. Most of them were corroded by US military water to prevent them from being used by the enemy. After receiving them, the Fisheries Management Office stacked them in an open space because there was no warehouse to store them, but wooden boards were placed underneath, and double layers of canvas were laid on top, plus a bamboo shed. The best ones have now been picked out and placed in the warehouses of nearby merchants. As for the appearance of rotten ropes on the market, it may be that they were distributed to various units and fishing vessels and then leaked out. The Fisheries Management Office itself did not sell them. (C) A total of 126 motor vessels. Sixty ships will be sold (the method will be announced by the custody committee), twelve ships will be used for training drivers, fourteen ships are in Qingdao, ten ships are in Taiwan, and four ships are in Hainan Island. The Fisheries Management Office regularly uses about 25 ships, but the sovereignty of the fishing vessels is still in the hands of UNRRA to this day.

The Impact on the Private Sector is an Overstatement

(2) According to statistics from the fishing market, in the past year, all parties caught a total of 770,000 dan of fish, of which 550,000 dan were caught by private sailing ships, 150,000 dan were caught by motor vessels, and the Fisheries Management Office only caught 70,000 dan. Therefore, saying that the office affects the private sector is an overstatement. Moreover, the Fisheries Management Office often transports the fish caught to other ports. As for the Executive Yuan's previous stipulation that the fishing market should sell the fish of the Fisheries Management Office, it is said that at least 500,000 catties per month, not at most 500,000 catties. (3) Processing plan: Because the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Salted Fish Production and Marketing Committee has not yet been established, the Fisheries Management Office uses surplus fish to make salted fish itself, which is not illegal, and this work is actually a loss.

Treatment Issues

(4) Treatment issues: Foreign crew members used to receive a monthly salary of 900 US dollars, which was based on the contract between UNRRA and our country. At the same time, they would also receive 40% of the fishing income as a subsidy each time. Since the contract was cancelled in April, the above 40% subsidy has been stopped. Chinese crew members can earn up to 50 million yuan in March and at least about 6 million yuan, with bonuses as high as more than 20 million yuan and as low as 3 million yuan. A profit-sharing system has recently been implemented, and no salaries are given.

Regarding Director Zhao's private residence in a foreign-style house, the chief secretary explained that it is the same courtyard as the office staff. It was approved by Deputy Director Wang after consideration that Director Zhao lives in a single house because of his large family, while other staff members live in a single house with several families.

### Serious Stage of Municipal Finance, Salaries Will Reach 400 Billion

Director of the Bureau of Finance, Tian Yong stated to reporters: "Due to the impact of prices and the cost of living index, the city's finances have entered a serious stage. The total revenue of the city's finances last month was approximately 326.5 billion yuan, while the total expenditure was 328 billion yuan, so it is already insufficient. Among them, the salaries of the employees of the city's bureaus account for approximately 130 billion yuan. If the recently disclosed adjustment in the treatment of public teachers and staff is followed, and the new index is 245,000 times, the salaries of only the staff and police will reach 390 billion yuan. This amount exceeds the city's total monthly revenue by more than 60 billion yuan, and other business expenditures will be even more uncertain. Therefore, the future of local finance is difficult to be optimistic."

### Policeman Beaten While Arresting Someone, Knitwear Factory Workers Cause a Riot

[Report from our newspaper] When the workers of the Zhongfang First Knitwear Factory on Yangchang Road in eastern Shanghai were dismissed from work at 6 pm on the 7th, a female worker, Wang Cailan, was followed and teased by a male worker from the same factory, Yu Xifu. When they reached the east end of Si Road, Wang rebuked him several times. Yu became angry and gathered a crowd to beat her and then fled. Afterwards, Wang reported the incident to the Maqiao Police Station, which sent police to arrest the culprit but failed. At about 6 pm yesterday, the Xinshi Street Branch continued to send employee Sun Zhijian to lead four plainclothes police officers to wait at the factory gate. Before long, Yu followed the crowd out and was arrested by Sun and others. When the male and female workers poured out like a tide at the end of work, seeing their companion being arrested, the crowd rioted and surrounded the plainclothes police officers, showering them with punches and kicks, and seizing one of Sun's official revolvers before dispersing in a commotion. Afterwards, the Yulin Road Branch reported the incident and urgently sent a large number of police officers to the scene, but the assailants had already fled without a trace. Sun Zhijian, who was seriously injured, was taken to the police hospital for treatment by car.

### Fallen Youth Confesses: Extravagant Spending on Pleasure, Arrested for Obtaining Money Under False Pretenses

[Report from our newspaper] At about 9 am yesterday, a young man, dressed in a Western suit and leather shoes, suddenly arrived at the office of the 34th Bao of the Zhujia Ku District of the Jing'an District, holding a Shanghai Good People's Voluntary Hospital fundraising booklet. He met with staff member Bian Yifeng and claimed that he had obtained permission from the municipal government to go out and raise funds for the hospital's foundation. When Bian asked to see the documents of permit and official documents, the young man attempted to escape after hearing the words. Bian followed and chased him out, immediately calling the police officer No. 706 of the Jing'an Temple Police Branch, who took him to the bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, his name is Shao Shuping, using the alias Li Huimin, 24 years old, from Ningbo, living at No. 12, Rencheng Lane, Shaonian Road, Xiaoximen. He also claimed to be the director of the Shanghai Good People's Voluntary Hospital at No. 65, Huining Road, and also the manager of the Pingping Scientific Testing Factory. However, there were many flaws in his confession. Director Yu, sensing that he was not a good person, immediately sent police officers to Huining Road in the Nanshi District to investigate the hospital, but ultimately failed to find it. They then returned to his home in Rencheng Lane, Shaonian Road, and found nine donation books for the fictitious hospital, several seals of the military defense, a Chunmao Qianzhuang checkbook, and a remittance book. There was also a love letter written by Zhang Ping, a dancer at the Xin Dahua Dance Hall. The suspect then bowed his head in silence, admitting that he was using the name of the hospital to make money to live on. Since February 15, he had raised 150 million yuan, averaging 3 million yuan per day. There were also two accomplices, Xu Lisheng and Mao Dongsheng, who were both at large. He continued to confess that at about 2 pm the day before yesterday, he went to the Hongxiang Courtyard brothel in Baokang Lane, Zhongzheng Middle Road, and paid 1.2 million yuan to invite the prostitute Hua Yuanyuan to watch a movie. He then went to the Xin Dahua Stage to dance. After dinner, he went to the Daguangming Cinema to watch a movie and finally went to the Mainland Hotel to stay in room 501, spending a total of more than 4 million yuan. By yesterday morning, because he had no money to use, he broke up with Hua Yuanyuan and went to the above-mentioned location to solicit donations, where he was discovered and arrested. He also confessed that he had committed the same crime in August last year and had been imprisoned for four months. Subsequently, the branch bureau summoned the prostitute Hua Yuanyuan and Zhang Ping, a dancer at the Xin Dahua Dance Hall at No. 566, Fuxing Middle Road, to the bureau. Hua Yuanyuan's confession was the same as Shao's, but Zhang Ping confessed that she had met Shao in June or July last year while dancing. According to Shao's claim, he was the manager of the Pingping Scientific Testing Factory, spending money like water, and a relationship developed over time. As for the love letter, it was indeed [written by her]. Later, Shao was sentenced to prison. Knowing that he was not a good person, her feelings gradually faded, and she no longer visited him often. After the investigation was completed, the branch bureau ordered the two women to return and sent the case to the local procuratorate for prosecution on charges of fraud.

### Demanding Old Debts, Denounced, Fake Chief Accountant of the Ministry of Finance, Ren Zhongdao Throws Himself Into the Net

[Report from our newspaper] Ren Zhongdao, the son-in-law of Zhao Zunyue, the false secretary general of the false municipal government, and the false chief accountant of the Ministry of Finance, who was wanted, has been arrested by the District Procuratorate and transferred to the High Procuratorate for legal proceedings yesterday morning. The process of Ren's arrest was as follows: The Lao Zhengxing Restaurant at No. 250, Guangxi Road was opened by Han Chinese suspect Xiao Qian during the enemy puppet period. After the victory, Xiao fled, and Xiao's brother-in-law, Guo Jinsheng, was responsible for the store's affairs. At the end of last year, the losses were quite large, and it was impossible to open the market for the New Year. Therefore, the partners elected Zheng Wenbo as the manager. Last month, Zheng received a call from Ren Zuyu, claiming that Xiao Gang had owed Ren Zhongdao money and that the District Court had ruled that Xiao should return the debt, otherwise the court would execute the seizure of the restaurant. Entrusted Guo Jinshan to contact Ren, and Ren asked for 16 million yuan. They agreed to pay 4 million yuan first, and Ren took out a note from Ren Zhongdao, with the seal already affixed. Zheng Wenbo discovered that it was forged, so he twisted Ren Zuyu to the police station and transferred him to the District Procuratorate for detention. Prosecutor He Huimin issued a summons to Ren Zhongdao to appear in court for confrontation. At this time, someone secretly reported that Ren Zhongdao had been wanted for suspicion of being a traitor. After the District Procuratorate telegraphed the High Procuratorate for verification, it was confirmed to be true.

### Implementation Measures for Limiting Bill Offsets: Four More Instructions from the Ministry of Finance

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the offsetting of bills from banks and financial institutions, the Financial Management Bureau recently obtained four instructions from the Ministry of Finance: (1) Regarding the request to allow bank drafts and remittance receipts to be used for offsetting in accordance with promissory notes and certified checks, it has been verified that it is feasible and permission is granted. (2) It is not appropriate to discuss allowing banks and financial institutions to sign contracts for offsetting with new rice merchants based on their creditworthiness, as it goes against the original intent of the promulgated measures. (3) The request to extend the deadline for banks and financial institutions to report on the implementation of bill offsetting contracts with their customers by one month to April 15th should be approved. (4) The proposal for banks and financial institutions to use customer collection bill guarantees to replace contracts is feasible; however, the clause in the original guarantee form stating that the bank or financial institution has the right to terminate or reduce the offsetting amount at any time should be deleted to prevent abuses. In the future, banks and financial institutions must sign new contracts when reducing the offsetting amount for customers. When stopping the offsetting for customers, the original contract should be strictly terminated. Banks and financial institutions should report to the Financial Management Bureau and the bill exchange of the Central Bank for record-keeping in advance when reducing or terminating the offsetting amount for customers, and may not dishonor checks on the grounds that the collection amount has not been received or for other similar reasons.

### The Trend Does Not Escape a State of Fatigue: Trading in Chinese Stocks is Desolate

Yesterday, new short positions on Chinese stocks continued to increase, and the trend did not escape a state of fatigue. Hong Kong telecom stocks contracted, and the Guangdong faction supplemented short positions, but still rebounded after falling. Crackdowns are being intensified, and trading is pitifully small, with no upward momentum for the time being.

When the market opened in the morning, the atmosphere was languid. Wing On Silk opened at 1870 yuan, and the rise and fall of each stock was minimal. After the opening, trading was sparse.

Yesterday's rice market opened in the morning with tin prices falling again, making people's hearts even more timid. Merchants saw no improvement in the market and sought to sell one after another, so prices fell again by 100,000 yuan. White japonica rice was 3.65 million in the South City market, and 3.75 million in the North City market. Midway, due to the low price, the outflow became active, and the market stopped declining and rose, with the afternoon market rebounding by 50,000 yuan. As a result, it fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Indica rice was firm and popular because the price in other regions was high and the inventory was scarce. Unpolished indica rice and rough indica rice showed slight gains. The South City market's Yinbai Yuan still stood at the original price. The total arrival of goods yesterday was 3,640 stones.

Flour

Yesterday, the market's decline intensified. It was heard that American flour had arrived, and people's hearts were extremely timid. Merchants competed to sell, but customers remained unmoved, so prices plummeted. Navy ship flour opened at 1.39 million, and later fell to 1.365 million yuan. Old car flour, etc., uniformly fell by 65,000. Bran wanted to rise but instead fell, and finally returned to a low of 30,000. The wheat mill price was reduced to 2.1 million minus 50,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Firm and strong. The Shantou faction chose high-quality goods for soybeans, and the market was able to maintain its stability. The corn market was flat, but the outflow was still active. Red sorghum was stable. Mung beans had sales in both the North and South factions, rising by 100,000 yuan. Sesame was targeted again by the Tianjin faction, continuing to rise by 200,000 or 300,000.

Also, it is reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyu transport ship loaded 8,700 tons of rice from Yangon this time and set off on the (12th) the day before yesterday to return to Shanghai, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month.

### Customer Absorption is Still Sluggish: Manufactured Silk Continues to Fall: Factory Management Stabilizes Silk Goods

Yesterday, the situation of manufactured silk cloth continued to fall. Because the absorption of this street and customers is still sluggish, and the absorption power of practical factories is also weak, it is therefore difficult to revive. In the morning, No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 230 million yuan. Afterwards, outsiders absorbed it in small amounts, and it began to rebound. It finally closed at 233.3 million yuan, down another 2 million. Dongyang and Gaoshan, etc., also continued to fall by about 2 million.

The silk market tended to stabilize, matching yesterday's market, with sparse transactions and a languid atmosphere. In the morning, CD grades were still calling for 36.5 million yuan. At noon, 5 dan of open-mouth goods were traded, priced at 35.5 million yuan. Gan Jing, from Zhili, rebounded, and at noon, 5 dan of the top 18 points were made, transporting 31 million yuan.

The silk fabric market continued to fall yesterday. In the morning, Dachen quilted fabric was made for 140.2 million yuan. There was absorption at lower prices, and it once rose to 141.5 million yuan. In the end, due to the sluggish stock market, it softened near the close, with the current price being 141 million yuan, a 2.4 million yuan decline. Fengchou followed suit, falling by 10,000 yuan. Transactions were quite active, and the rest mostly stood firm.

### Customer Absorption is Weak: The Yarn Market Generally Softens: Cotton Cloth Has Abundant Chips and Prices are Also Reduced

Yesterday, the yarn market showed a stagnant situation. The absorption of customers was still sluggish, and this street also took a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in sparse transactions. The initial opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix hovered at the closing price of the previous day. Later, it was rumored that the authorities were investigating the account books of yarn dealers, and people's hearts softened at one point, once making 228 million yuan. However, the reproduction industry saw gains at low prices, and the market slightly rose near the close, finally closing at 233 million yuan, up another 3 million. 42-count Bingguang and Shuiyue both rebounded firmly by 2 million. 21-count Double Horse opened at 145 million yuan. Although the table-side gang hyped it up, once seeing 247 million yuan, the pressure from the short side was heavier, and it finally fell back, closing at the opening price, down 5 million. The digestion of each grade of 42-count yarn varied, with mixed results. Each grade of 61-count yarn tended to be sluggish, with a general decline of 2 million to 3.5 million yuan.

Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, Tianjin customers had sales, dye factories had sluggish absorption, and although retail investors entered and exited frequently, they were purely buying low and selling high. Furthermore, because the street merchants turned into the off-season, the absorption was even scarcer. The allocation of textiles for construction was abundant, resulting in 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opening at 4.84 million, gradually falling to 4.76 million yuan. Then, retail investors absorbed it at lower prices, rebounding to 4.78 million yuan at the close.

Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company supplied 4.48 million yuan for La Batong fine cloth, 4.53 million yuan for Sijunzi Yuan Biji, and 5.35 million yuan for Sijunzi Yuan Fujiu, and few people applied.

### The Fuel Management Committee Enriches Coal Reserves: 180,000 Tons Shipped Monthly

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, they have recently reached an agreement with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to ship 180,000 tons of coal feet monthly. The bureau is responsible for allocating ships to transport any shortfall to Shanghai.

Regarding the foreign coal portion, 7.548 tons of white coal purchased from the Soviet Union for the production of coal briquettes has recently arrived, but there has been no arrival of bituminous coal.

### Foreign Trade in Tea is Sparse

Yesterday, tea merchants felt that the inventory was still scarce, and because tea workers were expected to continue to increase, they were unwilling to loosen their hold on the goods in their hands. However, the domestic sales of tea were considered too expensive by this street and the customers, and they adopted a negative attitude. Regarding the foreign trade of various types of tea, exporters were also sorting out the goods that had been prepared in recent days in order to quickly load them for North Africa, so the buying momentum was weak and the process was both sparse, making it difficult for transactions to become active. However, the underlying potential remained firm, with no downward trend.

Also, according to the tea industry, the tea season is approaching, and the Mao tea in the production areas of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui are entering the development period, and will soon be produced one after another. However, this year, due to the abnormal weather and the lack of mild climate, and the impact of soaring prices of all things, the tea body is not as fresh and tender as last year, and the price is expected to be surprisingly high. Looking at this situation, it is still uncertain whether the actual sales will be smooth.

### Textile Factories are Moving to Hong Kong and Guangdong: The Flower Management Committee Says it Has Not Heard of It

The Sino-Economic Society reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Flower and Yarn Cloth Management Committee to inquire about several important issues that are currently attracting attention regarding the management of flower, yarn, and cloth. The conversation was as follows: Question: How many factories have exchanged cotton for yarn during the trial period of spinning and weaving on behalf of your committee? Answer: 36 factories, including Dafeng, have applied to exchange cotton for yarn. 7 factories, including Zhaofeng, have signed contracts. 8 factories, including Yongmin, have been asked to come to the committee to sign contracts. 2 factories, including Datong, are in the process of handling. 19 factories, including Xinyu, are still under investigation. Question: As of now, how much raw cotton has your committee entrusted to China Textile, Agricultural Bank, and other institutions to purchase, and how much is in stock in Shanghai? Approximately how many numbers do you have? Answer: (1) China Textile purchased more than 200,000 bales on behalf of the committee, (2) China Agricultural Bank purchased more than 80,000 bales on behalf of the committee, (3) Cotton Union purchased more than 16,000 to 17,000 rejections on behalf of the committee, (4) Self-purchased more than 20,000 bales, (5) The Foreign Sales Committee transferred 14,000 dan of Indian cotton to our committee. The total amount that has arrived in Shanghai warehouses is approximately 160,000 dan. Question: The relocation of textile factories to Hong Kong is of great concern to all parties. What is the attitude of your committee? Answer: We have not heard of the relocation of textile factories to Hong Kong. However, what we know is that the yarn ends that some factories have ordered from foreign countries have arrived in Hong Kong, but they have not been shipped to Shanghai immediately, which is a fact. There may be talk of building factories locally, but it may not be possible. The reasons are: (1) The climate in Hong Kong is not suitable for spinning, (2) The land price in Hong Kong is extremely high, so how can it be easy to build a factory.

[Another Report] According to an authority in the industrial sector, the economy in South China is stable, the region is peaceful, it is easier to purchase raw materials, there are fewer regulatory agencies, and production efficiency can be increased several times compared to Shanghai. It is learned that 700 tons of textile machines from the Shenxin Factory in this city have already been transported to Guangzhou for installation yesterday. They plan to establish a new factory there to develop the business. It is also learned that the machines ordered from the United States by several emerging factories in this city were originally scheduled to be transported to this city for installation, but it is now heard that the machines have also been directly transported to Guangzhou for unloading.

### Response from the Epidemic Prevention Committee: Thorough Implementation of Smallpox Vaccination for Refugees; Reply to Reader Liu Quandu

The Committee has received a response from the Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee stating: The Committee has been strictly implementing smallpox vaccination for refugees. However, due to the scattered and transient nature of the refugees' residences, it has not been possible to vaccinate everyone at the same time. Most refugees in various refugee camps, public offices, and those living in shantytowns have been vaccinated, with an estimated vaccination rate of over 80%. The Committee will strive to gradually and thoroughly implement smallpox vaccination for refugees within the possible scope.

### Social Mores and the Human Heart

— Wu Yong

When external circumstances undergo turmoil, the inner human nature will naturally also change. During wartime, human nature is like a bottle of liquid containing sediment. After violent shaking, the unclean substances originally at the bottom rise to the top. Human nature is just like this, agitated by war, its worst aspects, which were originally latent and static, are now released. Human nature is like a bottle of pure calcium hydrate, and war is like sulfuric acid, a coagulant. Adding this coagulant to the calcium hydrate promotes robbery, rape, hoarding, speculation, murder, arson, and other unclean sediments of human nature. After such a dramatic change, human civilization is temporarily pushed back thousands of years. In wartime, most people adhere to the laws of the barbaric era: everyone for themselves, and the words of the stronger are justice. Even when peace arrives, order is difficult to restore immediately. The scum floating on top will not easily settle to the bottom for a long time.

The deterioration of human nature and the worrying state of social mores during wartime are, of course, facts. Therefore, some people who witness this are heartbroken and believe that the situation is getting worse and worse, giving rise to a sense that "each generation is worse than the last." Some even indulge in ancient sentiments, constantly yearning for "the good old days," with some meaning of recalling the past, restoring the old ways, and returning to simplicity. The catchphrase of this type of person is two sentences: "Social mores are deteriorating daily" and "People's hearts are not what they used to be." If these words express the speaker's dissatisfaction with the current state, indicating anxiety about the lack of improvement in the environment, then not only is it human nature and understandable, but it is also a manifestation of a healthy mind and the prelude to social improvement, and we should sympathize with them.

However, I firmly believe that the evolution of society is gradual. Although the evolution is slow, it is undoubtedly progressing forward at all times. At a certain period, we may feel that the evolution of society has entered a state of stagnation, or even a temporary reversal, but at worst, it is only as bad as it used to be. Even considering the situation during past wars, we only need to check history to know that there have been cruel and chaotic examples in the past. Therefore, the saying "Social mores are deteriorating daily" is not appropriate when compared to historical facts.

People of all generations have always thought that ancient times were so good and that the current situation is so bad. In fact, this is due to a psychological illusion because, in the eyes of most people, things near to reality are always inevitably flawed, while things that cannot be obtained or seen are often imagined to be better than they actually are. For example, people of all generations have always praised Yao and Shun endlessly and slandered Jie and Zhou, but Confucius said: "The evil of Zhou was not as great as that." Then, conversely, we can infer that the virtue of Yao and Shun was not as holy as praised.

The psychological background of the saying "Social mores are deteriorating daily" is simply the four words "venerating the past and belittling the present." It should be known that although today's environment has many things that are not ideal, it is not as if the entire present world is the eighteenth level of hell, just as ancient times were not necessarily a paradise high in the clouds. Wang Chong said it well: "The scholars of the past and the scholars of the present are the same, both containing the nature of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, their encounters will all have moments of dedication. There were unrighteous people in ancient times, and there are righteous people in the present. Good and evil are mixed together, which age does not have them? Those who recount events like to elevate the ancient and demean the present, valuing what is heard and belittling what is seen. Debaters then talk about what is old, and writers then write about what is distant. There are wonders near that the debaters do not mention, and there are differences in the present that the pen does not record."

Chinese people seem to be particularly fond of the past. For example, preserving national treasures, admiring antiques, and painters who like to paint ancient figures are all manifestations of a love of the past. This excessive habit of loving the past may be one of the reasons hindering progress. In summary, my conclusion is: social mores are not deteriorating daily, and people's hearts should not be ancient.

### Talking About Eating Noodles After Returning from Hangzhou

— Chen Yixian

The popularity of spring travel to Hangzhou this year is unprecedented. It is reported that the Kuiyuan Restaurant noodle shop uses more than one dan of eel a day. Kuiyuan Restaurant is famous for its shrimp and fried eel noodles. Yellow eel is most plump in late spring and early summer, which is now in season. The day before Children's Day, I and my wife took my granddaughter to Hangzhou for a short three-day stay. I did not go to Kuiyuan Restaurant, but I still ate noodles twice. One time was at Jushui Restaurant in Baoyoufang. Its shrimp and fried eel costs 160,000 yuan a bowl, the same price as Kuiyuan Restaurant. The noodles are light and wide, the raw ingredients are fried in oil, and the toppings are generous. According to friends, its taste is above Kuiyuan, and it is a new shop opened in recent years. The other time was at Jusheng Restaurant in Fengqiao Lane. I lived in Hangzhou for twenty years before July 7th and often went to this shop to eat noodles with two or three friends. It is the oldest noodle shop in Hangzhou, and its 100th anniversary was last year. The owner's surname is Weng. This time I went to eat, and I ordered half-soup noodles. I mentioned the past to the shop assistant, and the noodles were indeed good, because the owner heard that I was an old patron from ten years ago and was particularly attentive. Shanghai people who travel to Hangzhou only know Kuiyuan Restaurant, but they do not know the newly opened Jushui and the century-old Jusheng. I wrote this article to inform future travelers.

Ballpoint Pens Are Not Worth Using

In Chongqing, just after the victory, several auction houses were already displaying some ballpoint pens, with prices quite expensive, requiring 250,000 yuan a pen, equivalent to the price of one tael of gold at the time. Everyone could only look at it with curiosity, wondering how adding ink once could allow it to be used continuously for several years, which was inexplicable.

Later, after returning to my hometown - Shanghai - to visit several relatives whom I had not seen for nine years, I took some silver from Chengdu and dangshen from Chongqing to send to them. They sent me a jade-colored ballpoint pen, which was worth about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan at the time. I felt it was too expensive, but due to their kindness, I had to accept it. So I began to study its structure. It turned out that there was a tiny steel ball on its tip, smaller than one-thousandth of the pen tube. When writing, the steel ball rubbed against the paper surface and thus rotated, and the ink in the pen tube adhered to the surface of the steel ball and was printed on the paper, thus writing the words. At that time, if you had a ballpoint pen, you would immediately feel your value tenfold, and everyone would look at you with admiration. But after using it for a short time, it often failed to write. The instructions told you to blow into a small hole at the end of the pen, so that ink could come out, hoping to use air pressure to squeeze the ink down, but the result was sometimes effective and sometimes ineffective. The reason why it could not write was probably due to the paper. When writing on ordinary paper, the fine hairs on the paper would follow the rotation of the steel ball and enter the tube, thus hindering the movement of the steel ball and preventing it from writing. Later, the ink in the pen not only did not come out of the tip, but squeezed out of the small hole at the end of the pen, even if the small hole was plugged, it was useless, and the pockets were covered in ink stains. Once, due to the large expansion and contraction of heat, the steel ball flowed out along with the ink, making a mess. It was difficult to find it in the ink for a long time before finally finding the steel ball and inserting it into the pen tube. From then on, I put it aside and did not use it, to avoid further trouble.

Several of my friends who had ballpoint pens either could not write with them or had the steel ball flow out. My relative who gave me the pen also had the steel ball of his pen flow out, causing a new long gown to be completely covered in ink stains, and his hands were also stained with ink, which could not be washed off. This was simply not a ballpoint pen, but a disaster pen. I think those who have used the Renault ballpoint pen all had curiosity at first and were intimate with it, but in the end, they all discarded it aside, hating it to the bone, because it not only cost money, but was also not practical and caused trouble. The number of these pens in the hands of our people should not be small, cheating us out of our money, which is considerable. Shanghai people say: Tricky business, as long as everyone is tricked once, he can make a fortune. My personal loss is a small matter, but I hope that everyone will never be tricked by Renault again!

### Philately

— Hongxian

Many friends like to collect stamps, and many regard rare foreign stamps as treasures. In fact, Chinese stamps are the most valuable stamps in the world. There are three reasons why they are so valuable, and I will list them for the reference of philatelists. First: The face value of Chinese stamps is astonishing, ranging from half a cent to one hundred yuan. This is probably the face value of stamps in various countries in the world, but we in China have stamps priced at one thousand to ten thousand, or even one hundred thousand, and perhaps even millions. These astronomical prices are one of the characteristics of preciousness.

Second: There are many types of Chinese stamps. Almost every year, new patterns are issued, and there are stamps limited to certain places and stamps changed to a certain amount of money. The large differences can also be listed as treasures.

Third: The paper and ink used in Chinese stamps often have blurry defects. These defects are often appreciated by philatelists. Look at the same version of stamps, and their colors often vary greatly, which can be used for the verification of curious people.

I remember that there are countries in the world that use stamps as financial revenue. If China could sell complex, novel, and large-denomination stamps in the world stamp market, it would definitely be profitable. It has not yet been done, which is truly a pity.

### Not Music?

— You Ting

Mozi opposed music, saying: "The people have three worries: the hungry cannot eat, the cold cannot be clothed, and the tired cannot rest... To make music is wrong."

This logic of Mo Di can be refuted with four words: "refraining from eating for fear of choking." However, looking at the quiet passing of this year's National Music Festival (April 5th), without even a record concert, it can be seen that the cultural authorities who created this festival may be well-versed in Mozi's words and unwilling to provide the people with music amidst the war.

However, some things are unbearable: In Shanghai, there is an atmosphere of singing and dancing in the tall buildings, "music" is everywhere. Turn on the radio, and there is a continuous stream of songs: "My dear, my nemesis!"—those "music" with the most clumsy techniques and the most lascivious content.

After the songs of "China Night" and "Manchurian Girl" stopped, what fills the ears of the citizens is still mainly low-grade emotional sound scores. In such a situation, even a music festival is too stingy to embellish, what more can be said? Not willing to advocate, not willing to educate the people, how can the people's taste not be low.

It is the friendly nations who are anxious for us. The United States Information Service recently, in addition to its bi-weekly record music appreciation meetings, also holds special concerts every week (both with free admission), doing some social music education work for this huge Shanghai. Although the effect is limited, at least students, civil servants, and working youth can benefit.

Recently, the Wing Wo Industrial Company has also been broadcasting symphonic and other classical music every weekend on the Greater Shanghai and Chinese-American radio stations, introducing the outline of modern music to everyone and raising the general level of appreciation. Even if this is advertising in nature, its meaning and effect are worthy of gratitude! Moreover, standing on the position of commercial advertising, and being able to incidentally sow some seeds of art in Shanghai, a large city in the East, so that this smog-filled space can still retain some white parts, so that the masses can also have a moment of cultivation and rest; we hope that someone will follow the example of this industrial company's pioneering initiative.

At the same time, we do not believe that the cultural authorities with the responsibility of leadership really think that there is no need to talk about music at present, at least for the next generation, it is not appropriate to do so!

### Under the Cherry Blossoms

— He Tianjian

Participating in a cherry blossom viewing party, sitting under the cherry blossom trees, I couldn't help but feel all sorts of emotions. I composed two poems to show to my countrymen. If I may be so bold as to request harmonizing verses from others, please mail them to me at No. 1283 Fuxing Road, this city.

It doesn't matter that the flowers bloom in a foreign land, today the east wind is shared by one family. Looking out, we must be as broad as heaven and earth, with what intention can we treat things as different from ourselves! In spring, thousands of layers of snow in the garden, the wind moves the branches, ten thousand pieces of rosy clouds, sitting for a long time, how do I know when people have dispersed, I raise my head and suddenly hear half a crow's cry.

The sound of war drums moves the earth, yet I still leisurely look, the people bring happy hearts to see for half a day, the flowers should be more timid than Xishi towards Yue (I hope the countrymen pay attention to this sentence), I often think of the Eastern Jin and expect peace (name of a person); lingering, how many generations pity the urgency of spring, I shake off my emotions and laugh that I have exhausted them, a month ago under the plum trees, my bowels twisted nine times, nine times sour!

### Anecdotes of Coolidge

— Leng Leng

President Coolidge of the United States had a female secretary. Because she often made mistakes in punctuation, Coolidge wanted to find a way to correct her mistakes, but he did not directly blame her; he first praised her in an admiring tone:

"I think your appearance and dress are very beautiful, and you are also very capable in doing things. You are truly a perfect girl."

The female secretary was flattered, her face shy and coy, and her heart was unusually happy.

Coolidge then smiled and said:

"Don't be shy, a beautiful and capable girl is worthy of being praised."

He walked over and stood next to the female secretary's typewriter.

"Oh! Are you typing the record of my conversation with reporters yesterday? It's about..." He deliberately leaned closer to look at the typewriter.

"What? Is there something wrong with the lead letters on the typewriter keyboard? Look, the punctuation marks are always wrong, let me try it."

Secretary Ann hurriedly got up and offered her seat. Coolidge sat down and tried typing carefully, then stood up and said to her:

"There's nothing wrong, but just pay a little attention when typing punctuation marks. Try it yourself again."

The female secretary had already understood Coolidge's intention and felt ashamed in her heart; afterwards, she not only did not make mistakes in punctuation but also typed unusually accurately and quickly. This is of course due to Coolidge's understatement, which made her aware of her mistakes and improve.

### Errors in Language Usage

— Jie Xian

"Wen Zhi Bin Bin" (The Analects of Confucius, Yong Ye): "When the substance exceeds the form, you get rustic simplicity; when the form exceeds the substance, you get a scribe. Only when the form and substance are in harmonious balance, you get a gentleman." Bao's commentary: "Bin Bin means that the form and substance are half and half." According to this, "form" refers to external expression, and "substance" refers to inner content, both of which are metaphors for a person's character. Nowadays, describing a person as refined and courteous is "Wen Zhi Bin Bin," and even describing behavior as "Bin Bin Ran" or "Bin Bin You Li" seems inappropriate.

"Qu Xiao" (to make fun of), popularly refers to teasing someone. However, "Qu Xiao" actually means inviting ridicule from others. In the Biography of the Family Servants in the History of the Five Dynasties: "Writing is not something one can master without practice; spreading it by word of mouth only invites ridicule." The current interpretation of the term is the opposite of its original meaning.

"Yi Chang San Tan" (One Sings and Three Sigh): In the Record of Music: "One sings and three sigh, there will be lingering sounds." Commentary: "Chang means initiating a song phrase; San Tan means three people sighing along." It means one person sings and three people harmonize. Nowadays, "Yi Chang San Tan" is used as a metaphor for the lingering, profound, and touching emotions of writing, which is also inconsistent with the original meaning.

"Zhi Shi" (Executive): Someone who serves others by providing service for their use. In the Guoyu, Yueyu, the official Wen Zhong of Yue used Wu to replace Goujian to give a speech: "...daring not to make a sound to the king, privately to the lower executives said..." Zuo Zhuan: "Make lower officials reward the executives," the former shows that Goujian dared not compete with the King of Wu, so he called them "Executives," the latter clearly refers to those who provide service. Today, people often refer to the other party as "Zhi Shi" in letters, which is very disrespectful. Some say that the reason for calling "Zhi Shi" is a humble way of not directly referring to the person, but this is also quite far-fetched.

"Wei Suo" (trivial): Sima Xiangru's biography in the Records of the Grand Historian: "Moreover, when a wise ruler ascends the throne, is it merely a matter of trivial grasping, being restricted by written rules and customs, following and reciting what has been passed down, and simply trying to please the world?" (Difficult to the elders of Shu) Suo Yin: "Wei Suo means petty and fragmented." In modern times, "Wei Suo" is often used as a metaphor for a person's vulgar appearance and behavior, which is actually not the original meaning.

"Guan Si" (lawsuit): Originally meant all officials. Zuo Zhuan: "Preparing objects and documents, officials managing ceremonial vessels;" also "The duties of the servants and the guards of the officials are not matters for the ruler." Nowadays, the matter of litigation is called "Guan Si," and the act of litigating is called "Da Guan Si" (to fight a lawsuit) or "Chi Guan Si" (to eat a lawsuit), which is incomprehensible. Some say that "Guan Si" is the matter of officials, but what officials manage is not limited to litigation, so this explanation is also lacking.

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

But, if a newborn baby laughed out loud as soon as it was born, wouldn't you feel your hair stand on end?

Pigs wallow in the mud, lotuses bloom white flowers in the mud.

When it rains, we can't hold up a small umbrella and tell people, "Now, the sky is clear."

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shengyan

Chapter 14: Carefree at Sea – 125

After finishing writing, I looked it over again, wondering what Qiwan would think after reading this letter? She is extremely fond of me and must feel the same. I don't hope to rekindle our old love; I only want her to understand my heart, to know my troubles, and for us to communicate through letters often, and my soul will be comforted. After writing this letter, Zhu Zhai thought about it carefully before undressing and going to bed. It felt like a major event had been completed, and his mind was much calmer. The next day, he woke up as soon as it was light. Thinking that from today onwards, he would change his life and not continue to be so muddled and confused. In the past, he worked hard to learn opera, always getting up at dawn. Now, in addition to going to the bank for work every day, he would still entrust his spirit to Peking opera. His father had said that having entertainment outside of work could regulate the spirit, so he would try it for a while. Maybe it could gradually wash away the troubles in his heart. Thinking, Zhu Zhai put on his clothes, hastily washed his face, took a sip of hot water, and hurried out. At this time, the sky was just dawning, and the air on the road was clean. Zhu Zhai walked slowly on the road, thinking to himself that in recent months, he had been so obsessed with Qiwan that his mind was unsettled, sleeping late every night and getting up late in the morning. He hadn't enjoyed this clean morning air for several months. If he hadn't suffered a severe blow, he wouldn't have come out for a walk today. He also thought about how he met Qiwan because he came out to practice his voice in the morning, which led to an unexpected romance. Unexpectedly, it was a fleeting moment, turning to emptiness in the blink of an eye, leaving behind troubles that couldn't be washed away. This kind of spiritual loss is irreparable. It shows that a person shouldn't have wishful thinking; everything should be done according to one's own place, to avoid many disputes. Thinking and walking, unknowingly, he had reached the back door of Zhongshan Park. At that moment, he remembered that he had met Qiwan in this park, but today it was all a thing of the past. "I'll go in and take a look." Thinking, he walked through the park gate, crossed the wooden bridge. Behind the garden, a bend of pond water was still quiet and still. A slight breeze swept across the surface of the pond, creating a ripple. It was already the late spring month of February, and only in the northern country did there be a hint of spring. Along the water, the willow trees, the willow branches had a hint of green, reflected in the water. The water pattern slightly rippled, the willow silk clung to each other, which was beautiful.

### On Poetry and Rhyme

— Qinglei Academy

The local news section of this newspaper on March 30th contained Mr. Pan Gongzhan's poem inscribed on a painting in Hangzhou, an impromptu note, which is different from Mr. Sa Lao Zhenbing's poem of thanks to Zhong Bao on the same page, which emphasized the importance of commemorating an event. Mr. Pan saw his wife painting and, moved by the inspiration, inscribed a poem, hence comparing Sa's painting style to meticulous brushwork and Pan's to freehand brushwork. Pan's poem is also a seven-character quatrain, and the last line, "Today the earth returns to spring again," also implies the meaning of post-disaster recovery, hence it is full of vitality. But the great difference between the two poems lies in the use of rhyme.

Sa's poem follows the poetry rhyme (seven yang), while Pan's poem does not adhere to one rhyme (the characters 菲 (fei) and 微 (wei) belong to five wei, while the character 回 (hui) belongs to ten hui), which can be studied in terms of "principle" and "precedent." (1) In principle, "rhyme" values "harmony"; if there is no "harmony," there is no such thing as "rhyme." This principle is easy to understand. As for the so-called standard poetry rhyme, which has been practiced for more than a thousand years, there was no detailed investigation when it was formulated, and the sounds of ancient people and contemporary people, and the sounds of place A and place B, were extremely complex. Therefore, there are characters in the rhyme that are not harmonious, and characters that are harmonious are not necessarily in one rhyme. And throughout the generations, especially in response poems, the style of the Imperial Academy prevailed, using this to shackle the freedom of thought, so there has never been a modern revision. Because men of letters have no other practical standards to rely on, and it is not appropriate for everyone to follow their own convenience, leading to unbridled chaos, they can only make do. Therefore, this poetry rhyme has not been abolished due to inertia. (2) Those who are good at using this skillfully in the past either selected rhymes or selected relatively broad rhymes to use (such as the "seven yang" used by Mr. Sa, which is one of the broad rhymes, with many characters that are not mixed, even when composing long passages, it is not at a loss), or selected those that are harmonious within one rhyme and used them (such as Wang Yuyang's first poem about autumn willows, the rhyme feet "魂 (hun)", "門 (men)", "痕 (hen)", "村 (cun)", "論 (lun)" are all harmonious and very coordinated, all within the thirteen yuan rhyme category, but characters such as 繁 (fan), 園 (yuan), 原 (yuan), 援 (yuan), etc. within the thirteen yuan are absolutely discarded. Fortunately, it is a broad rhyme, even if it does not go out of rhyme, it is still easy to handle). Furthermore, crossing rhymes means not being restricted by the original purpose of poetry rhymes. For example, Zhang Tanhua's (posthumously named Wen Xiang, named Zhi Dong) poem when passing through Wuhu to mourn Envoy Yuan (Yuan Chang, whose courtesy name was Shuangqiu, once served as the Wuhu Taoist, and was killed in Gengzi as the Taichang Qing who advocated suppressing the Boxers) said: "The Seven-Nation Allied Forces knocked on the gate, knowing that you repelled the enemy and mended the sky. For thousands of years, people have mourned the Chao family order, once planning for the king for all." The rhyme foot of the first line belongs to "fifteen shan," while the last two rhymes belong to "one xian," that is, not being restricted by the rhyme category. Because it is his own work, he has this freedom. Mr. Pan's poem inscribed on Tang paintings in his tour of West Lake also crosses two rhyme categories and is also his own work, so he is not restricted. If Zhang Tanhua's works during the imperial examinations and various examinations during his tenure in the Hanlin Academy also crossed in this way, not only would he not be able to enter the Hanlin Academy, but he would probably have the same misfortune as Gao Xinkui, who had "a double fourth grade in his life, and deserved thirteen yuan to die," how harmful is the book "Poetry Rhyme"! (Gao Xinkui served as Suzhou Muyuan County during the Qing Dynasty Tongzhi period. His failure to enter the Hanlin Academy and his demotion to county magistrate was due to his poems being out of rhyme and being ranked in the fourth grade. The story is seen in Xue Fucheng's Yong'an Notes)

In recent years, the style of writing poetry has been very popular. The high chanting of President Zhang Qun, Dr. Weng Wenhao, General Zhang Xueliang, and General Feng Yuxiang have all been seen in the newspapers. The works of Zhou Zuoren, Jiang Kanghu, and so on, are even more common (whether they are false or not, everyone speaks their own poems, so it is also worth mentioning). Moreover, the British writer G. K. Chesterton is also vigorously promoting Chinese poetry (see Shen Bao, February 24). At this moment, when the atmosphere of war is all over the world, the leisure and elegance of national poetry travel with it, how is it different from the blue lotus in the fire and the precious raft in the sea of sin, so it is necessary to examine the details of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, and discuss them carefully.

### Chronicle of the Inaugural Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Communication

— Yue Fan

If we want China to become a modern and progressive country, the development of transportation and the promotion of industry are the most important tasks at present. Therefore, various academic societies with the ability to promote and improve are indispensable organizations. It has been more than seventy years since the establishment of telecommunications in China. In terms of the Ministry of Transportation alone, there are more than 40,000 telecommunications workers across the country. However, due to the backwardness of our country's science and the underdevelopment of industry, various telecommunications facilities still cannot keep pace with other advanced countries. Modern telecommunications technology is changing rapidly. If we want to build a new China's telecommunications in the future, we must catch up quickly. Therefore, on December 28th of last year, the first Telecommunications Memorial Day, the Chinese Institute of Electrical Communication was initiated by telecommunications colleagues and telecommunications experts across the country. After several months of active preparation, it was officially announced on the 11th of this month. The following is a record of the meeting of the inaugural meeting that day:

The venue was set on the third floor of the Shanghai Training Institute for Telecommunications Personnel on Yuyingtang Road. More than 230 people attended, including representatives of telecommunications bureaus from various regions, Wang Jiashu, instructor of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and guests Zhao Zukang, former president of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, Zhao Zengjue, president of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineering, and Zhuang Zhihuan, president of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineering. At 9:00 AM, the meeting began. After performing the rituals, Yu Bingjian and Lu Zongcheng, the organizing committee members of the association, reported on the significance and process of organizing the association and thanked the telecommunications comrades for their cooperation and the guests for their presence and guidance. At the same time, they hoped that domestic telecommunications professionals would participate in cooperation and research. Subsequently, the instructor of the Ministry of Social Affairs and guests Zhao Zukang, Zhao Zengjue, and Zhuang Zhihuan gave speeches, many of which were pertinent. Finally, the draft constitution was revised and association affairs were discussed. Yu Bingjian was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. After heated discussions by all members, the following resolutions were passed: (1) The main revision this year is Article 6: "Any telecommunications service personnel with more than two years of telecommunications service experience after graduating from domestic and foreign universities, more than five years after graduating from junior colleges, or technical, reporting, telephone, accounting, business, and other telecommunications personnel who have been engaged in telecommunications for more than ten years and have achieved excellent results, can be introduced by two members and become a regular member after the board of directors reviews and approves the application. Graduates of universities or junior colleges who are engaged in telecommunications or technical, reporting, telephone, accounting, business, and other telecommunications personnel who have been engaged in telecommunications for more than three years and have achieved excellent results or have equivalent qualifications can be introduced by two members and become an associate member after the board of directors reviews and approves the application." In addition to adding "seven alternate directors and three alternate supervisors" in Article 15, the rest were passed. (2) In addition to the representatives from various regions serving as ex-officio members, eleven additional people were elected as members of the electoral commission due to the complexity of this election. (3) The candidates for directors and supervisors shall be nominated at the principle of ten people per thousand people. (4) The first directors and supervisors shall be produced before May 28. (5) The first annual meeting is scheduled to be held in the capital on this year's Telecommunications Memorial Day. (6) Publish an annual. (7) Solicit telecommunications comrades from all over the country to participate enthusiastically and establish branches as soon as possible. The meeting ended at 12:00 noon and was quite enthusiastic.

### From an Economic Perspective – Charge Account Telegrams

— Jun Zhong

After the victory, prices have been constantly rising. The amount of telegrams coming and going to and from the market is closely related and has become a proportional comparison. Shanghai, in particular, is a place where merchants from all over the world gather, and business is frequent. The fluctuations in the market can affect the economic changes of the whole country. Therefore, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, as the central hub of the country's nervous system, is crowded with telegram senders every day, who often have to wait a long time to take their turn. In fact, express telegrams have already been delivered to the other party in this short period of time. The senders are anxious because of the wait and believe that our telecommunications bureau is inefficient and only wastes time.

The busiest time for receiving telegrams is usually from about 11:00 AM to 4:00 or 5:00 PM. In the short span of five or six hours, more than 10,000 telegrams must be received. And each telegram needs to go through three procedures: calculating the fee, collecting the fee, and writing a receipt. The sales staff work tensely without stopping, but they still can't clear them in time.

In order to compensate for the above-mentioned shortcomings and increase the speed of telegram transmission, charge account telegrams were created. Ordinary telegrams are paid for with cash. For institutions or businesses that send a lot of telegrams in a day, payment and collection will be overwhelming, not to mention wasting valuable time and affecting the speed of telegrams. Therefore, after adopting the charge account telegram method, the troublesome payment procedure is changed to a one-time return signature, which in other words saves more than two-thirds of the waiting time.

The registration procedure for charge account telegrams is very simple. Just fill out an application form to the business section of the telecommunications bureau, and the business section will estimate the amount of telegrams the user sends and receives each month and collect a corresponding deposit. The current minimum amount is five million yuan, which is not an excessive collection, assuming that one telegram is sent for one hundred thousand yuan per day. However, charge account telegrams have not yet been widely used by users. The biggest reason is that users generally lack understanding of the nature of charge account telegrams. Users think that paying a considerable deposit at one time means that the interest on this idle account is lost invisibly. In today's high-interest loan environment, who doesn't want to activate their funds? However, this situation seems reasonable at first glance, but it is not so in reality. Let the author give an example: At the beginning of the month, you opened a charge account and paid a deposit of five million yuan. You then continue to send telegrams every day. The interest before sending the first telegram is calculated at five million yuan. The daily interest is no more than fifty or sixty thousand yuan. The second time, the telegram fee that has been sent should be deducted, and the daily interest will be even less. By the end of the month, the amount of the deposit and the telegram fee paid are almost mutually offset. But you can still continue to use it until the specified deadline and pay the outstanding telegram fee for the previous month. In this way, the user's loss is minimal, but they can obtain interest benefits by making good use of charge account telegrams.

We hope that users can understand our actual situation and make full use of charge account telegrams to help the speed and accuracy of telegram sending.

### Machine Capacity Reached Limit, Telephone Installation Suspended in Hongkou District

Telecommunications News

The Hongkou district of this city is vast, with numerous merchants and organizations, and the need for telephones is extremely high. However, due to the limited capacity of the original machine keys, supply cannot meet demand. Although the bureau has repeatedly planned to expand, the source of machine keys is scarce, and improvement and expansion cannot be realized in a short period of time. The current capacity of the Hongkou central office is 2,600 lines. As of now, the number of users actually installed has reached the maximum limit, and it is impossible to increase the load further. In the future, applicants for new installations in the Hongkou (including Zhabei) district will not be able to be installed temporarily until the machine keys of the central office are improved and expanded.

### A Brief History of the Invention of the Telephone

— Wang Dachun

We all know that the inventor of the telephone was Alexander Graham Bell. However, when he invented the telephone, there was also an Elisha Gray who also invented a telephone. On February 14, 1876, they both sent the machines they invented to the U.S. Federal Patent Office to request registration. In terms of time, Bell was only two hours earlier than Gray. Although these two telephones, after testing, Bell's was more flexible and was adopted, and has been improved and used to this day. However, it cannot be said that it is a miracle in the history of invention that two people who do not know each other study the same problem in the same place at the same time and invent the same machine and publish it to the world.

Gray was born in Barnesville, Ohio, USA. He devoted his life to the study of electricity and finally invented a telephone. Unfortunately, his results were not as good as Bell's simultaneous invention, so his hard work was lost in obscurity. Bell was born in Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, in 1870. He went to Canada with his father. Two years later, he moved to Boston, USA, and taught at Boston University. He liked to study electricity since he was a child. At first, he wanted to transmit sound waves to distant places by means of electricity. After several years of experimentation, in 1876, he made the first telephone, which was the beginning of the invention of the telephone. Bell's father was originally a kind person who taught poor deaf children. Young Bell was influenced by him and also taught many deaf children in Canada, not only teaching them to use signals instead of speaking, but also using his experimental telephone to transmit meanings to distant places using various different sound wave signals.

In addition, there is another electrical inventor that we cannot forget, and that is the well-known Thomas Edison. In addition to inventing electric lights and electric railways, this man made great contributions to the improvement of telegraphs and telephones. As a child, Edison was just a newspaper boy at the Milan train station in Ohio, USA, but he had great ambitions. He used his savings to buy a small printing press and lead type, and printed his small newspaper and sold it when traveling on the train. Travelers were moved by curiosity and eagerly bought his newspaper. Edison thus saved more money to buy various books and scientific instruments. Because he often entered and exited the train station, he was very familiar with the railway staff and borrowed a baggage car as a laboratory. Unfortunately, once he overturned some acid liquid, and a fire broke out in the train. Although it was extinguished, the baggage car manager kicked him out of the station. At that time, his scientific experiments could hardly continue. Later, on one occasion, he saw a child standing on the railway track at the station as a train approached. Edison jumped onto the track and rescued the child, regardless of his own safety. This was the stationmaster's son, who was grateful for Edison's kindness in saving his son and invited him to be the station's telegraph operator. From then on, he had the opportunity to study telegraphs and telephones and invented the Quadruplex Telegraph System, which can send four telegrams simultaneously on one telegraph line. In terms of telephones, he invented a Carbon Granual Transmitter, which is used in our telephones. In addition, there are many telephone machines that have been improved by him and are now in use. He is truly a great contributor to the history of telephone invention.

### Telegraph Common Sense Talks (10)

— Zhang Jiayu

Lecture 4: How to Write the Recipient's Name and Address

Since the post office changed the weight unit for airmail letters from every ten centimeters to twenty centimeters, it is said that the sales of airmail envelopes in various stationery stores have been greatly discounted. The reason is obvious: before the weight unit for airmail letters was changed, any airmail letter weighing more than ten centimeters but less than twenty centimeters had to be charged double the airmail postage. Our purpose in sending letters is nothing more than to convey the words written on the letter to the recipient. Who would be willing to pay an extra postage fee just to use a thicker (heavier) envelope?

If we apply the same mentality to telegrams, which are charged according to the number of words, our purpose in sending telegrams is nothing more than to convey the message to the recipient. Who would be willing to increase the burden of telegram fees for a lengthy recipient's name and address? However, before you understand the various tricks of saving words in the recipient's name and address, you have to write the name and address in detail, otherwise the telegram will be delivered incorrectly or not delivered at all. Don't believe it? Please see the examples below:

"Shanghai, North Zhongshan 1st Road (786), Lane (84), Li Zixing, Remit Quickly, Wang"

The above is the full text of a telegram, totaling seventeen words (the place name "Shanghai" is counted as one word), including the recipient's location and recipient's name and address, which account for thirteen words, the message three words, and the sender's signature one word. Except for the sender's signature, which the sender can decide whether or not it's needed, the sender spends almost only one-sixth of the total telegram fee on what he actually wants to say—the message—but the cost spent on the recipient's name and address accounts for almost five-sixths of the total telegram fee. Its uneconomical nature is conceivable. However, if you try to save words by reducing any word in the name and address at will, it may cause delivery errors or even non-delivery, which may lead to a mistake.

In this lecture, the author intends to introduce to the readers one by one the various methods of saving words and fees in writing the recipient's name and address. Needless to say, when it comes to the most economical and effective method of saving the number of words in the recipient's name and address, it naturally has to be

telegraph registered. The "registration" mentioned here is completely different in nature from registered letters in the post office or registration for medical consultation. Let us try to use an example to illustrate the use of telegraph registration. For example: There is a Gongyu foreign firm in Shanghai, and its address is No. 7 Zhongzheng East Road, Shanghai. Before it has registered with the telegraph office, all telegrams sent to it from all parties must specify the recipient's name and address in detail as "Gongyu Foreign Firm, No. 7 Zhongzheng East Road, Shanghai", which is charged as eleven words (the recipient's location "Shanghai" is counted as one word). If it first goes to the local telegraph office to register a telegraph registration number, that is, identifies one word—say 0361 (Gong)—as the code for its name and address, then all telegrams sent to it from all parties only need to write the recipient's name and address and the recipient's location as "0361 Shanghai", which is charged as two words. In other words: After it recognizes the telegraph registration number, each telegram sent to it from all parties can save nine words of telegram fees.

Telegraph registration is divided into two types: Chinese and foreign languages. Foreign language registration is limited to no more than ten letters, and Chinese registration is stipulated as four digits. However, in Shanghai, due to the insufficient supply of four-digit registration numbers, a new type of six-digit Chinese registration number has recently been added. The validity period of telegraph registration is divided into long-term and short-term types. The long-term is one year, and the short-term is three months. The fees are very low. The registration fee paid by registered users every month is only equivalent to the telegram fee of ten ordinary Chinese telegram words. Foreign language registration and Chinese registration can be used in both Chinese and foreign language telegrams. Telegrams sent from abroad can also use foreign language registration to replace the recipient's name and address.

For telegrams sent to registered users for transfer, just add the words "transfer to someone" after the recipient's location, for example, "0361 Shanghai transfer Wang Zhiren", and for foreign languages, just write the recipient's name in front of the telegraph registration number, adding the word c/o (transfer) in the middle, for example, Wangchihjen c/o Jointmerc Shanghai (assuming Jointmerc is the foreign language telegraph registration number of a certain user), but in order to avoid delays in transfer, it is better to go directly to the telegraph office to register a telegraph registration number yourself, followed by

telephone number to replace recipient's address For telegrams sent to recipients who have telephones installed in the local receiving bureau, the telephone number installed at the recipient's residence can also be used to replace the recipient's address, but the recipient's name must be specified, and the word "Telephone" must be added in front of the telephone number, for example (Chinese telegram) or "Telephone (11130) Shanghai Zhang Jiayu" "Changchiayu Telephone 11130 Shanghai" (foreign language telegram). After receiving this telegram, the telegraph bureau first checks the address of the telephone user with the number 11130 in the local telephone book, and then opens it into a telegram envelope together with the recipient's name for delivery.

The nature of using a post office box number to replace the recipient's address is not much different from using a telephone number to replace the recipient's address. For telegrams sent to recipients who have rented post office boxes in the local receiving bureau, the post office box number can also be used to replace the recipient's address, but the recipient's name must be specified, and the words "Post Office Box" must be added in front of the post office box number, for example, "Shanghai Post Office Box (486) Xu Dazhong" (Chinese telegram) or "Hsudahchung Postal Box 486 Shanghai" (foreign language telegram). After receiving this telegram, the telegraph bureau will send it to the local post office and put it into the post office box with the specified number, allowing the box renter to pick it up himself. From here, we can imagine that if the box renter does not go to the post office to pick it up at any time, the telegram may be delayed.

If the recipient has neither a telegraph registration number nor a telephone or post office box, then the name and address must be written in detail for telegrams sent to him from all parties, but please remember the following points:

(1) Where street names, neighborhoods, etc. can be replaced by numbers, it is not necessary to use the full name of the street or lane, but only the number of the street or lane, for example, "(380) Street" is counted as only two words.

(2) The house number can be written in Arabic numerals in parentheses, and it is not necessary to write it word by word. For example, "three hundred and eighty-five" is counted as six words, but "(385) No." is counted as only two words.

(3) If there are words such as A, B, C, D, etc. after the house number, the foreign letters ABCD can be used instead. For example, "No. 32 A" can be written as "(32A) No.", which is counted as only two words.

(4) The recipient's title, such as "Mr.", "Ms.", "Director", "Uncle", etc., should be avoided as much as possible.

(5) If the name and address are written in English, then it is best to spell out the recipient's name completely, for example, write Zhang Jiayu as Changchiayu, so that it can be combined into one word. If you write CY Chang, it will be counted as three words. The name of the street can also be written together, for example, Nanjing Road can be written as Nankingroad or NanKingrd.

(6) There are many places with the same place names in China and foreign countries. For example, Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province in our country, was originally named Chang'an, but there is also a Chang'an County in Zhejiang Province; people only know that the capital of Chile is called Santiago, but who knows that there are as many as forty-nine places called Santiago in the world. In this case, the sender must add the country name or province name after the place name to avoid sending it wrong. The recipient's location, regardless of the length of the number of words, such as "Shanghai", "Harbin", "Er Lizihu", and regardless of whether the country name or province name is added after the place name, is counted as one word.
