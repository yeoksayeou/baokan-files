### Crowds Gather on Mogan Mountain; Weng Wenhao, Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, and Wang Shijie All Arrive; The President Hosts a Banquet and Inquires About Financial and Economic Matters

[Special Dispatch from Mogan Mountain, July 29th] President Chiang spent the entire day of the 29th touring the mountain. Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, Xu Baiyuan, Yan Jiagan, and Wang Shijie arrived here together today upon being summoned. Wang Shijie also brought his son, Wang Jiwu. Weng and the others took a special plane from Nanjing at 1:00 PM, arrived in Hangzhou at around 3:00 PM, then transferred to cars and drove directly to Mogan Mountain, arriving at the mountain at around 6:00 PM. The President summoned Weng and the others at 8:00 PM and kept them for dinner, extensively consulting them on current financial, economic, and monetary issues. Weng and the others did not leave until around 10:00 PM and spent the night at the Mogan Mountain Hotel. Yu Hongjun also arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 29th upon being summoned, and then immediately went up the mountain.

President Yu Hongjun met with this newspaper's reporter at the Mogan Mountain Hotel at 6:00 PM this evening. When the reporter asked about the general situation after the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, he stated that prices have now shown a significant trend toward stabilization. The reason for achieving such success is due to the government's four major policy decisions: (1) contracting currency, (2) selling off materials, (3) balancing foreign exchange, and (4) absorbing overseas remittances. These items have been thoroughly implemented, and a large batch of US aid materials will arrive in mid-August, so there is no reason for prices to rise again. Regarding the Legislative Yuan's recent passage of a bill restricting the increased issuance of currency, he stated that there are many reasons for rising prices, and currency is only one of them. After arriving here, he had an audience with the President. The President inquired in detail about Shanghai's prices and financial problems, as well as how to handle the arrest of market speculators.

[Special Dispatch from Mogan Mountain, July 29th] Weng Wenhao and five others arrived here today upon being summoned and went up the mountain at 6:30 PM, staying at the Mogan Mountain Hotel. The newly appointed Chief of the Zhejiang Provincial Police and Security Department, Mao Sen, also came and stayed at the Linhai Villa. After arriving here, they gave a brief talk to this newspaper's reporter. Weng said that he came upon being summoned and also to escape the summer heat. Wang Yunwu said that the property tax bill did not pass this time, but it will be discussed again next time. As for the fundraising for the special relief donation, it will definitely be completed before the end of this month. Xu Baiyuan said that after US aid arrives, it should be used frugally, and he also believes that contracting currency will have no impact on production. Wang Shijie praised the beautiful scenery of Mogan Mountain and said that this place and the magnificence of Lushan can complement each other. Afterwards, the reporter subtly asked Director Weng whether Mogan Mountain could replace Lushan as the summer capital this year. Weng smiled and said he did not know.

[Special Dispatch from Mogan Mountain, July 29th] Chiang Ching-kuo and his wife, along with their sons, climbed Mogan Mountain yesterday to pay their respects to the President and his wife. At noon, the President's family gathered for a meal. Chiang Ching-kuo went down the mountain that evening, and the grandchildren stayed on the mountain to serve. The President showed great care for his grandchildren and asked them about their schoolwork and how they spent their leisure time. The President gave many instructions on the construction of Mogan Mountain, telling Director Wang that forests should be planted on Ta Mountain and that some places should be used as pastures. This morning, the President wore a black Xiangyunsha casual outfit and lay on a rattan chair, facing the sun, looking around at the morning scenery nearby. More than twenty villagers came to the mountain and asked for his signature, which was granted, and they left joyfully. Xuan Tiewu came to pay his respects, and the President inquired in detail about the political and economic situation in Shanghai and gave instructions on his work. After completing his official business, Xuan went down the mountain to Hangzhou and then to Shanghai. (For news of Xuan's arrival in Shanghai, please see page four)

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Mogan Mountain, July 29th] Governor of the Central Bank, Yu Hongjun, arrived at Mogan Mountain at 4:00 PM on the 29th and immediately paid his respects to the President to report on his duties. According to Yu, speaking to reporters, since this bank issued larger denominations of banknotes, the government has tightened credit and sold off materials, so the prices that once caused waves soon stabilized. The issuance of larger denominations of banknotes this time was due to the lack of banknotes in various places and the difficulty in turnover for industry and commerce. It was really to meet the needs of the facts, and only the denomination of the banknotes was increased, not the number of banknotes issued. This should be specially stated. The recently implemented foreign exchange settlement certificate method has been quite effective in absorbing overseas remittances. Yu also said that the general economic situation is quite optimistic.

[Report from This Newspaper's City Office] Upon receiving a telegram from the President, Yu Hongjun returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and then went to Hangzhou, making a special trip to Mogan Mountain to pay his respects to the President. In addition to reporting on his duties, Yu's trip is said to provide detailed opinions on the control of finance and prices in the future, so that the authorities can legislate a plan and unify command of price management in the future.

### Thirty-Six Supervisory Commissioners for Twelve Administrative Offices; Elected by the Control Yuan; Sending Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Truth of the July 5th Incident

[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Nanjing Office, July 29th] The Control Yuan held its 26th meeting at 10:00 AM on the 29th, chaired by Director Yu. After the Secretariat reported on the minutes of the previous meeting, Cao Dexuan and more than twenty others proposed a temporary motion: "It is proposed that this Yuan quickly send commissioners to thoroughly investigate the truth of the tragic case of the Northeast students in Beiping on July 5th." After being submitted for discussion, it was unanimously approved without objection. Then, the election of supervisory commissioners for the administrative offices was conducted. Some candidates had submitted their resignation of candidate qualifications due to certain reasons. The voting began at 11:15 AM and ended at 11:45 AM. After the ballots were counted immediately, thirty-six supervisory commissioners for twelve administrative offices were thus produced. The reasons for the temporary motion of Cao Dexuan and others are as follows: "Since the tragic case of the Northeast students in Beiping on July 5th, not only are the elders of the Northeast extremely indignant, but they are also running around and appealing to all parties. At a time when the military campaign against bandits is constantly tense, this move in Beiping is really related to the safety and security of the overall situation. The tragedy occurred nearly a month ago, and there has not yet been a reasonable solution. Allowing it to fester like this will give the cunning bandits an opportunity to take advantage of it. The impact on the future is unimaginable. This can be seen from the evolution of the July 5th Incident. Therefore, it is earnestly requested that this Yuan immediately send personnel to Beiping to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to handle it. It is really essential."

[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Nanjing Office, July 29th] The supervisory committee's supervisory commissioners for each supervisory district and the supervisory commissioners for each administrative office were elected by vote on the morning of the 29th. The results are recorded as follows:

[Central News Agency Dispatch from London, July 28th] After arriving here from the United States this evening, Chen Lifu, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, said: "I came to London to investigate the British state industrialization plan.

### The Indirect Purpose of Premier Weng's Proclamation; To Dismiss Groundless Peace Rumors; Continuing to Maintain Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union

[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Nanjing Office, July 29th] People in the capital who read Premier Weng's proclamation, "Distinguish Right from Wrong and Walk Through National Difficulties Together," believe that it is of great significance for Weng, as the head of the government's executive branch, to issue such a composed proclamation to the people at a time when the European and Asian situation is obviously becoming more serious. A diplomatic and social figure familiar with the evolution of the situation in China over the past three years pointed out that the indirect purpose of Premier Weng's proclamation is to dismiss the recent groundless peace rumors. The perpetrators of the peace rumors are the "third parties" in Beiping and Hong Kong. Those who are tainted with it are either excessively naive or have ulterior motives. It is no longer possible to talk about peace today. The tension in the current situation in Berlin and the increasing exposure of the CCP's rebellion, its international nature are sufficient to prove the meaning of the proclamation's statement that "the national people have reached the point of life and death, and there is no room for ambiguity and hesitation." A related official revealed that this proclamation by Premier Weng is domestic in nature. Therefore, although the Communist International is mentioned in it, the Soviet Union is not mentioned. He hinted that this article will not have any consequences in diplomacy. China and the Soviet Union will continue to maintain friendly relations, and pending issues will also be negotiated and resolved through normal channels.

### Economic Issues Between China and Hong Kong; Negotiations Between Both Sides in Nanjing

(3) We will abolish the official exchange rate of legal tender against the Hong Kong dollar. (4) The China-Hong Kong agreement will be implemented immediately and measures will be strengthened.

### Cheng Qian Attends the Hunan Provincial Assembly; Makes His First Policy Report

[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Changsha Office, July 29th] Cheng Qian attended the Provincial Assembly on the 29th and made his first policy report since taking office, lasting one hour. It was divided into five parts: people, construction, finance, education, and security. Cheng emphasized that although the current situation in Hunan is fortunately stable, there is a possibility of becoming a war zone at any time. Saving Hunan should emphasize economic construction, but since the internal turmoil has not ended today and the economy has not improved, symptomatic work cannot be delayed. Therefore, we will make every effort to establish local self-defense forces and urge them to complete it. We hope that the Assembly will support security expenditures. If the province's defense expenditures rely entirely on the central government, then given the central government's financial resources today, the province's self-defense forces will be difficult to realize.

### The County Magistrate's Wife Blocks the Road and Weeps, Asking for Justice for Her Husband

When Cheng left the meeting place, Ms. Tan Zilian, the wife of the former Dayan County Magistrate Huang Yingchuan who was killed, blocked the road and wept, asking for justice for her husband.

However,馮雲仙 believed that the relief of refugees and the treatment of wounded soldiers were imminent facts that we should face squarely.

### Jinan's Outskirts are Tense; Bandit Troops are Approaching Step by Step

### We Continue to Negotiate and Sign Treaties of Friendship with Various Countries in Central and South America

The Plan to Increase Training of Envoys is Implemented Step by Step

[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Nanjing Office, July 29th] Information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: In recent years, the international status of the twenty countries in Central and South America has become increasingly important, and their relationship with our country has also become increasingly close. In order to promote friendly relations and enhance the status of overseas Chinese, our government has successively negotiated and signed treaties of friendship and commerce with various countries. This Ministry has also formulated a plan to increase and adjust the envoys in various countries in Central and South America, which has been implemented step by step since 1947. At present, there are five embassies, seven legations, three consulates general, two consulates, two vice consulates, and one office. The countries that have not yet established envoys or have established concurrent envoys without resident ambassadors have also been planned as a whole. Our country's envoy to Panama is currently concurrently stationed in Honduras and El Salvador.

### Encouraging Overseas Chinese Capital to Return Home for Production is a Kind of Self-Help Plan; Dong Xianguang Says the Government is Determined to Solve Economic Difficulties

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, July 29th] At a press conference on the 29th, Director Dong Xianguang responded to a reporter's inquiry about the government's change in the management of overseas remittances, which has been reported in various ways, asking to show the details of the current methods: The inquiry is presumably referring to the "Regulations on Application for Importing Overseas Chinese Capital and Funds of Nationals Abroad for Investment in Domestic Production Enterprises" recently promulgated by the government. The full text of these regulations was announced yesterday. The main purpose is to encourage overseas Chinese capital and funds of nationals abroad to return home and engage in domestic production enterprises. Although our country's policy of controlling foreign exchange has been very effective, it is unavoidable that the needs of domestic industry have not been fully taken into account. In order to meet the needs of the industrial sector and promote production, these regulations have been promulgated. In short, the spirit of these regulations can be summarized as follows: (1) Machinery and equipment, etc., required for enterprises that are needed domestically are allowed to be imported. (2) Raw materials required to maintain existing enterprises are allowed to be imported by returning overseas Chinese capital as collateral materials. This point also has two layers of meaning: one is to protect the currency value of the investor himself, and the other is to supplement the insufficient raw materials of existing enterprises. (3) In the past, merchants have imported highly profitable luxury goods from abroad by falsely using the names of overseas Chinese. Therefore, in these regulations, strict prevention and control must be added to this possible situation. It is firmly believed that the implementation of these regulations will definitely meet actual needs, and the application procedures are not complicated. The competent authorities will provide applicants with effective convenience as much as possible.

Secondly, these regulations are also a kind of self-help plan to cooperate with US aid. Although the amount of US aid is quite large, it is very clear that it is insufficient. China deeply appreciates the generosity of the United States and understands its own responsibilities, using all its assets to adapt to the current economic environment. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that this new method can absorb a large amount of foreign capital from Chinese nationals and use it for domestic production enterprises.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the government would advance both the War of Resistance and national construction with the greatest determination. The government today holds the same determination to solve the difficult problems in the economy.

### Hu Shi's Speech; There is No Need to Establish the Suppression and Construction Committee; National Representatives Should Not Receive Annual Fees; Convening a Temporary National Assembly is Really Inappropriate

[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Beiping Office, July 29th] Hu Shi recently commented on whether the Suppression and Construction Committee should be established, whether national representatives should receive annual fees, and whether a national assembly should be convened, saying: Under the current circumstances, there is really no need to establish the Suppression and Construction Committee. The establishment of this organization will not benefit the Suppression and Construction work. As for the annual fees of national representatives, I also believe that they should definitely not be received. The national representatives are all people of status in society, and they already have occupations and fixed incomes. They should not take salaries from the government and increase the burden on the people. There is no need to convene a temporary national assembly to discuss amending the constitution. Whether a constitution is good or bad must be tested over a considerable period of time to know its strengths and weaknesses before starting to modify it. Our constitution has only been implemented for a few months, and we have not seen the advantages and disadvantages, so it is really inappropriate to convene a temporary national assembly.

### On Selfishness Zheng Huachi

Many of humanity's evils are all produced by selfishness. Taking the world as a whole, undoubtedly, the world has now formed two major groups, one is the democratic group led by the United States, and the other is the communist group led by the Soviet Union. The United States and the Soviet Union are competing for supremacy, making the people of the whole world uneasy. Before genetics confirms that the wisdom and abilities of the world's ethnic groups are truly different, we can only admit that Yan Zi's words are correct: "What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I? Anyone who strives can be like him." Since human wisdom and ability are the same, why must the United States and the Soviet Union compete for supremacy and make the whole world uneasy? My answer is: The United States and the Soviet Union are both too selfish. Furthermore, taking China as an example, the corruption of Chinese politics and the greed of officials are also slowly evolved from selfish psychology. For decades, the figures on the Chinese political stage have always been the same people after selection. Are those figures who have dominated the Chinese political stage for more than 20 years truly capable and talented? I don't think so. The country's affairs have been brought to such a terrible state, and the people are suffering to such an extent. I dare not say that they should bear full responsibility, but at the very least, they should learn from the style of British and French politicians and voluntarily retire to allow newcomers to try. Politics is an organism and also needs metabolism. If politics is corrupt, new blood should be injected. But the situation in China is not like that. The people of the whole country are loudly calling out: "We want change, we want big change! We want reform, we want big reform!" But in reality, the changes are still made by the old people. Why? My answer is also the word "selfishness." How should the term selfishness be explained? I will first give a definition: "All behaviors that harm others and benefit oneself are called selfishness." Selfish behavior must harm others, but it does not necessarily benefit oneself. Sometimes it even harms oneself. For example, war always results in both sides being hurt. Why do people have selfish psychology and behavior? I think it is produced by two motives: (1) to seek survival, and (2) due to laziness.

First, if humans want to survive, they must have several minimum conditions: such as the satisfaction of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and entertainment. The distribution of natural resources in various parts of the Earth is very uneven. What one country has, other countries often lack, or even have none at all, so they compete with each other, resulting in the most tragic world wars in human history. After the First World War, the German slogan was "A nation without space." This means that the German nation has no space and cannot survive. So the German slogan was "We must strive for space in order to survive." This is an important reason for the occurrence of World War II.

To solve the conditions necessary for human survival, the most reasonable way is for humans to have a spirit of mutual assistance and help each other, exchanging goods for goods. In this way, everyone can have the necessities of life, and everyone can have plenty of food and clothing and live in peace and happiness. The world's disputes can naturally be eliminated, and large-scale wars can naturally be extinguished. This is humanity's highest ideal, and it may not be easy to achieve in a short time. Since this most ideal method cannot be achieved for the time being, then humans can only take a step back and seek the next best thing. Although the types and quantities of natural resources are limited, the changes in matter are infinite. We can use scientific knowledge and industrial technology to combine certain substances into a new substance, which is what is called "synthetic products" in chemistry. During World War II, the Germans used plant fibers to make clothing materials, used coal to make gasoline, and used hydrocarbons to make rubber substitutes, solving many difficult problems. Americans made even more new inventions during World War II, and their results were even better. The annual production of artificial rubber in the United States in 1939 was only 6.7 million pounds, but in 1942 it increased to 400 million pounds, an increase of 60 times in just three years. The quantity of artificial rubber in the United States was not only more than that of Germany, but its quality was also better than that of Germany. The United States is the most developed country in the automobile industry, and everyone knows the importance of rubber in the automobile industry. According to American scientists, the greatest contribution of Americans during World War II was the success of artificial rubber, which is absolutely true. If humans can help each other and exchange materials, then they will not feel the lack of materials; or use existing raw materials to manufacture what is lacking, then the problem of material shortages can still be solved. All the conditions required for survival can be met, and selfish psychology and behavior should be eradicated.

Second, humans have a bad habit, which is that they want to eat ready-made food, use ready-made things, and are unwilling to spend time thinking, time finding, or effort doing. In other words, it is laziness. Lazy people are the most selfish. To correct the disease of laziness, in my personal opinion, the best method is to promote the spirit of science. The development of science cannot be achieved overnight, nor can it be done by the power of one or two people. Scientific inventions are due to many scientists sacrificing their lives' energy, studying problems step by step, and accumulating experience bit by bit. The work that predecessors did not complete is continued by successors. When enough experience has been accumulated, there will naturally be new discoveries. Some lazy people think that scientific inventions are accidental, but in fact, people are thinking about it every day and working on it all the time. Familiarity breeds skill, which is the main reason for scientific invention. Accidental discoveries are just a way for people to deceive themselves. Pasteur, the ancestor of bacteriology, has a famous saying: "Work, work, always work!" This best represents the spirit of scientists!

After eight years of long-term resistance war, China's vitality was greatly damaged, social order was destroyed, and production was halted, resulting in social unrest and the people's livelihood becoming increasingly difficult. This is the consequence of war. The victors and the defeated suffer the same consequences. Even England and France are like this, let alone China? Material losses are easy to compensate for and are not worth worrying about. Under the current circumstances in China, what is most worrying is the widespread selfishness of people in all classes across the country. The thoughts and behaviors of people in China generally have a very bad idea: as long as it is something that is beneficial to themselves, they can all do it, and even do it blatantly. They do not consider the consequences, whether it is harmful to society or harmful to the country. Society is an organism, and the cells that make up society are citizens. If the citizens themselves are not good, then the society will certainly not be good. Now, people in general do not examine themselves or reflect on themselves, but instead blame society every day. Isn't this reversing the root?

My discussion of selfishness here is not from the perspective of a religious or moralist. Religious people persuade people to do good and use God's punishment as a warning, which is inevitably superstitious; moralists persuade people to do good, saying that if your character is good and your morals are high, then the world will admire you, which is inevitably pedantic. I am persuading people from the standpoint of a person who studies science. The spirit of science is to promote cooperation and respect reason. If everyone cooperates with one heart and one mind, all problems can be solved. If you often use reason, then you will never do things that harm others and benefit yourself. This is the minimum condition for being a person, and it can also be said to be humanity's highest ideal.

[This Newspaper, Taiyuan, 29th Dispatch] Raphan arrived in Taiyuan at 10:00 AM on the 29th. After visiting locomotive steel plants and other factories, he left Taiyuan at 2:30 PM in the afternoon. He praised the heavy industry very much.

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th Dispatch] Raphan flew to Shenyang from Beiping at 7:00 PM on the 29th. He is scheduled to visit Commander Wei at 10:00 AM on the 30th for talks. He will attend a banquet hosted by Wei in the afternoon and prepare to exchange views with the heads of the industrial and mining transportation departments. He is scheduled to leave Shenyang and fly to Beiping at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th.

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th Dispatch] Raphan is scheduled to visit Mayor Dong Wenqi on the 30th.

### Merger of the Commodity Tax and Direct Tax Bureaus: Tax Evasion Can Be Reduced

Talk by Jiang Shuge, Director of the National Taxation Bureau

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The reform of China's tax system will be gradually completed. The procedure for merging the Commodity Tax and Direct Tax Bureaus of the Ministry of Finance into the National Taxation Bureau is already being processed. The institutions in various provinces, cities, and counties have also been ordered to merge quickly. According to Jiang Shuge, the new director of the National Taxation Bureau, after the merger of commodity tax and direct tax, the institutions can be reduced, the authority can be concentrated, and under mutual coordination, the number of tax evasions can be reduced and tax revenue can be increased. For example, in the operation of yarn factories, because there are resident staff handling the collection of commodity tax, the number of raw materials used can be referred to and the business situation can be estimated. Therefore, the opportunity for tax evasion can be reduced. Before the war, China's commodity tax revenue was only in a secondary position in the national tax and was far less than the bulk of national tax revenue. However, during and after the war, due to the efforts of the people in charge, the amount of tax revenue has been greatly increased and has become the first in the national tax. Now, with the good foundation of commodity tax extended to direct tax, the increase in tax revenue in the future should be something to be imagined.

### Wu Tiecheng Discusses the Situation in Southeast Asia, Advocates Granting Autonomy to the Natives; Soviet Union's Foreign Policy "Two Steps Forward, One Step Back"

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang, told United Press reporters on the 29th, when discussing the situation in Southeast Asia, that colonial countries should immediately allow all ethnic groups to establish autonomous governments to stem the expansion of communism.

He said: "Politically, colonial countries will take advantage of unrest and instability to delay the realization of their promises to the native peoples - the establishment of autonomous governments and independence, but the Reds will continue to incite the native peoples to revolution to overthrow the ruling forces. Then, economically, the rich resources in these regions will be lost among the democratic countries. "Therefore, the only way to solve the Southeast Asian problem is to grant autonomy to the native peoples and assist them in establishing strong governments. This will effectively prevent communist propaganda and in-government activities."

Wu said of China's position: "China is the vanguard of resisting world communism, just as it resisted fascism in World War II."

He said that the Chinese Communist Party's condemnation of Tito undoubtedly confirmed that the CCP "is the agent of the Third International in China and is fighting for world communism." The current war in China is a desperate battle between patriots and communist aggression instigated by foreign powers."

When asked about his views on the Berlin crisis, Wu said: "The Soviet Union, like Germany before World War II, is taking the political initiative everywhere and adopting an aggressive policy. When it gets half of what it wants, it may seek an agreement to wait for a new action to get the remaining half."

He described the Soviet Union's foreign policy as: "Two steps forward, one step back."

### British Foreign Secretary Bevin Announces Halt to Demobilization in the House of Commons to Cope with Overall Situation; His Majesty's Government Willing to Negotiate Entire European Issue with Soviet Authorities if They Have Sincere Desire for Peace

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 29th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin, a few hours before the Western Allies presented a new note to the Soviet Union, stated in the House of Commons on the 29th that a portion of the British demobilization plan has been halted due to the Berlin crisis, but if the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade, it will begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on the entire European issue. He said that once the blockade is lifted, he will be ready to convene a four-power foreign ministers' meeting. Eliminating obstacles to negotiation is the immediate task. Bevin also stated that if the Soviet Union persists in its Berlin policy, it will inevitably lead to war, and the British government is determined to take any appropriate measures to cope with the overall situation. He acknowledged that the implementation of Soviet policy will make the situation in Berlin and Germany increasingly difficult, but "I do not believe that the policies of the wartime allies must inevitably lead to the use of force." Bevin said that the Western countries are always ready to discuss with the Soviet Union the Berlin currency issue, which the Soviet Union accuses of causing the current crisis. "Unless threatening means are used, we are happy to seek a reasonable solution with the Soviet Union through negotiations on any issue that may cause difficulties between the four governments." Bevin said that the scope of the four-power meeting could be expanded to include other issues.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 29th Broadcast: After Bevin announced in the House of Commons that Britain had halted part of its demobilization plan, Churchill questioned him, saying that Britain is still demobilizing, 20,000 people per month. Churchill demanded that Bevin provide a guarantee to halt all demobilization plans, to which Bevin replied that the matter is being considered by the government and will be decided within days.

[United Press London 29th Dispatch] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and Bevin's personal secretary Roberts left Berlin for Moscow on the same plane on the 29th to meet with French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Chatenot. According to the original plan, the three will jointly request a meeting with Molotov. Smith, as the head of the Western envoys to the Soviet Union, will read the Western statement and express the Western views orally to Molotov. Then, he intends to listen to any opinions of Molotov, and before leaving, he will submit a memorandum to Molotov. Although the Western allies are trying their best to keep it secret, many parts of their plan have been leaked. After repeated consideration here, the Foreign Office emphasized that the reason for the delay in issuing the reply to the Soviet Union is the French cabinet turmoil. Sources with absolute access to information said that the reason for the delay in the reply to the Soviet Union is actually because Britain has many difficulties with the procedures and forms of the note.

### Danube River Freedom of Navigation Conference Opens Today in Southern Capital; Soviet Union Sends Delegation Led by Vyshinsky to Attend

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 29th Dispatch] The Soviet delegation to the Danube River Conference, convened in Belgrade and led by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, arrived in Czech capital Prague today. Czech Foreign Minister Clementis personally welcomed them at the airfield.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th Dispatch] The Danube River Conference will open in Belgrade tomorrow. British diplomatic circles are highly skeptical of the effectiveness of the conference. In addition to the representatives of the four countries, Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France, there are also representatives from six reparations countries: Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. The Austrian representative will attend as an observer. Greece applied to participate in the conference at the last minute, which has made British officials uneasy, because the Danube River Conference agreement signed by the four countries, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Britain, on December 7, 1946, did not include Greece. The purpose of the conference is to make navigation on the Danube River as free as on the sea, as stated in Foreign Minister Bevin's declaration at the Paris Conference in October 1946. Before the war, there were 3,500 ships sailing between the east and west sections of the river, passing through Central and Eastern Europe, with 2,400 belonging to the six reparations countries. In practice, it has been completely suspended since 1945. Recently, as a result of the Soviet blockade of ships sailing out of the US and British occupation zones of Germany and Austria, the countries of Central Europe have lost this ideal waterway connecting them with Southern Germany and Austria. Well-informed British circles believe that the Soviet Union may not be willing to lift the blockade of the river, because the Soviet Union has declared to the Danube River countries that they cannot benefit from American aid. However, diplomatic circles expect that if the Soviet Union and its satellite countries are stubborn, the entire Danube River case will be submitted to the four-power foreign ministers' meeting for handling, because the Western powers will not be in the minority at this meeting.

### Berlin City Council Meeting; Communist Councilors Walk Out; Soviets Deliberately Create Split

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 29th Broadcast: The Berlin City Council held a meeting today in a tense atmosphere. Before passing a resolution condemning the Soviet blockade of Berlin, the Communist councilors walked out of the meeting together. Soviet newspapers had warned that this meeting would lead to bloodshed.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 28th Dispatch] Stoneman, appointed by the Berlin City Council to succeed Markgraf as Berlin Police Chief, took office in the American occupation zone of Berlin tonight. He declared that henceforth, all orders regarding the Berlin police will be issued by him, but until new orders are issued, the original laws will remain in effect.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 28th United Press Dispatch] Berlin Mayor Louise Schroeder has flatly refused to accept the order of the Soviet-controlled police chief Markgraf to return to his post. Schroeder wrote to the Soviet military commander here, stating, "If I accept the Soviet side's request, my actions will violate the established regulations of Berlin and conflict with my oath of office."

### Deteriorating Relations Between Yugoslavia and Hungary; Hungary Arbitrarily Arrests People; Politically Motivated

[United Press Budapest 28th Dispatch] Reliable sources disclosed on the 28th that the Hungarian political police have arrested the press counselor of the Yugoslavian embassy, ​​Bauer, who is related to the case of a Yugoslavian student affiliated with the pro-Communist Information Bureau being killed. A few days ago, at the official invitation of Hungary, two officials from the Yugoslavian embassy accompanied Bauer to the headquarters of the Hungarian political police in Budapest, where Bauer was immediately arrested. Hungarian officials refused to comment on this on the 28th, and the Yugoslavian embassy only said that Bauer is currently in Budapest but not in the embassy. According to reliable sources, after Bauer was escorted to the headquarters, he was taken to another room for questioning alone and then arrested. At the same time, Yugoslavia protested to Hungary against the Hungarian government's opposition to the Union of South Slavs in Hungary, but the Hungarian government refuted it, calling the move an "improper interference in overseas Chinese affairs."

### Australian Foreign Minister Advocates Rapid Conclusion of Peace Treaty with Japan

Tension in Europe Causes Repeated Delays

[United Press London 28th Dispatch] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt admitted at a press conference on the 28th that a peace treaty with Japan will never be concluded while the Soviet Union and the Western Allies are in dispute over the Berlin incident. Evatt acknowledged that the chances of concluding a peace treaty with Japan are slim, but said that the conclusion of this treaty is "a matter of urgency." Evatt said: "The repeated delays in concluding the Japanese peace treaty are largely due to the general situation, especially the situation in Europe." He emphasized that Australia is worried that Australia may be forgotten by the Marshall Plan. Regarding the harassment incidents in Malaya, Evatt said that the Malayan authorities are cooperating with the British and Australian governments to vigorously eliminate the terrorists in Malaya.

### South Korean Party Congress Ends Amidst Enthusiastic Support for Tito; Three Government Leaders Re-Elected to the Central Executive Committee

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 29th Dispatch] The South Korean Party Congress declared its closing today after unanimously supporting Marshal Tito and severing relations with the Communist Information Bureau. The Congress refuted the Communist Information Bureau's condemnation of Tito and re-elected not only Tito but also the other three South Korean leaders who were also condemned by the Information Bureau to the Central Executive Committee. Tito said in his closing speech today, "On behalf of the newly elected Central Executive Committee, I thank you for the trust you have shown in us. We will certainly repay the responsibilities entrusted to us." This speech was unanimously applauded by the representatives.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 29th Dispatch] Officials have announced that Marshal Tito has been re-elected to the Central Executive Committee of the South Korean Party. At the same time, the three people who were expelled by the Communist Information Bureau, South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Carter, Interior Minister Rankovic, and Minister Without Portfolio Djilas, were also re-elected. The South Korean Party Congress held a secret vote to elect its 63 new members of the Central Executive Committee on the 28th. The new Central Executive Committee includes 33 intellectuals, 29 workers, and 1 farmer. In addition, 24 members of the new Central Executive Committee are professional revolutionaries who had been members of the South Korean Party for as long as 17 years before World War II. According to foreign observers, among the generals currently commanding the Yugoslavian army, such as Chief of Staff Popovic and General Dashkevic, the liberator of Belgrade and tank expert of South Korea (whose name was recently seen in the newspapers, saying that Stalin wanted to replace Tito with him), no one has been proposed to the Central Executive Committee, making them serve as members.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 28th Dispatch] The South Korean Congress passed a motion today, stating that the Communist Information Bureau's condemnation was "inaccurate and unfair." It also unanimously passed a motion, approving the attitude of the Central Committee towards the Soviet Bolshevik Party's remarks and stating that the South Korean Party has not abandoned the principles of Marxism and Leninism. After the vote, the entire venue unanimously stood up and sang the Internationale.

### Division to Form New Cabinet, Excluding Communist Party

[United Press, Helsinki, 29th Dispatch] Finnish President Paasikivi today authorized the new Prime Minister Fagerholm to exclude the Communist Party from his new government. Although the President avoided mentioning the Communist Party, he told Fagerholm that the cabinet does not necessarily have to include the three major political parties in the country, namely the Farmers Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Communist Party. Fagerholm (Social Democratic Party) immediately announced: He will first try to form a coalition cabinet of the Social Democratic Party and the Farmers Party. If this plan fails, he will form a one-party cabinet of the Social Democratic Party.

### Large-Scale Exercises by British and American Air Forces over Britain and Northern Germany

### US Senate Discusses Truman's Proposals; Opposition Party Launches Filibuster; Taft Broadcasts Speech, Using Extreme Satire

[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] When the US Senate discussed the human rights bill on the 29th, the opposition party planned to deliver lengthy speeches in an attempt to obstruct it. However, people from all three parties were quite interested in a compromise plan, although there has been no progress so far. Southern Democrats said that in support of the long debate on the anti-election tax bill, they are prepared to launch a filibuster war. According to Republican senators, they selected the anti-tax voting bill to launch a filibuster war. Southern senators have appointed Stennis to lead the debate, and behind him, about 20 senators have unanimously decided to use lengthy speeches to kill the bill.

Once the Senate filibuster begins, it will take countless time, and other congressional committees will study other proposals submitted by President Truman. Other developments include:

(1) The House Banking Committee summoned former Price Administration Director Porter to discuss price wages and distribution control. (2) The Senate Banking Committee summoned Eccles of the Federal Reserve Board to discuss methods of restricting bank capital. (3) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened a meeting to discuss the International Wheat Agreement submitted by Truman to the Senate for approval. (4) Republican House members plan to meet on the afternoon of the 29th to discuss the policy statement issued by Republican leaders on the evening of the 26th, which rejects most of Truman's proposals. House leaders said that they will wait for the results of the Senate filibuster and the Banking Committee.

[United Press, Washington, 28th Dispatch] Taft, chairman of the US Senate Republican Policy Committee, delivered a broadcast speech today, saying that President Truman's convening of Congress is only a "political means." The President does not want to lower prices before the election. Truman's attempt to blame the Republican Party for the high prices is "a villainous act." He accused the Democratic Party itself of being responsible for this, because of their spending plans. Taft argued that the Republican-controlled Congress should adjourn immediately, but he also said that Republican members will remain in the meeting for about two weeks to discuss the parts of the 18 proposals submitted by Truman that can be regarded as urgent. Taft said, "The President does not lack the power to lower prices. In fact, he does not want to lower prices, especially before the election. He needs the votes of farmers who want agricultural product prices to be high. He needs the votes of workers who want wages to increase."

### Split in Italian General Confederation of Labor

### Allied Personnel Train Derails South of Kure Port

Possible Conspiracy by Japanese Workers

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th Dispatch] A train carrying Allied personnel derailed south of the former Japanese naval base in Kure Port at 4:50 this morning. This may be the first conspiracy by Japanese people to resist the occupying forces. Fortunately, no Allied personnel were killed or injured on the spot. This morning, a Central News Agency reporter visited Allied officials about this matter. They said that this may have been done by Japanese railway workers who were deeply angered by MacArthur's order to the Japanese government to ban strikes, but no evidence has been obtained to support the above suspicion. In addition, a Japanese passenger car also derailed north of here at 5:30 this morning. There were no deaths or injuries, and the cause of the accident is also unknown.

### MacArthur's Ban on Strikes by Civil Servants Arouses Strong Opposition from All Walks of Life in Japan; Labor Circles Believe it Violates the New Constitution

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th Dispatch] Teachers from several national universities and primary and secondary schools across the country in Japan continue to strike, openly protesting MacArthur's letter to Prime Minister Yoshida "banning strikes." Vice Minister of Education Arimizu said: If the cabinet does not issue a temporary ban on strikes or complete permanent ban on strikes legislation, he will not be able to stop the spreading strikes.

He also hopes that even after teachers are banned from striking, the government will continue wage negotiations with them, because the low wages of teachers are a widely recognized problem. Generally speaking, Japanese labor is taking an attitude contrary to that of the cabinet, not recognizing MacArthur's letter as an instruction, as the cabinet interprets it. However, before the legislation banning strikes is completed, civil servants are still free to strike. Labor leaders have also accused MacArthur's letter of violating the new constitution praised by the Allied Headquarters. Article 28 of the constitution clearly stipulates: "The right of workers to organize, negotiate, and take collective action shall be protected."

### Major Explosion at Chemical Plant on the Banks of the Rhine; 18 Houses Destroyed, Casualties Reach Over 2,000

Originally an important part of the Nazi war machine, it has been under the control of the occupying authorities since the surrender and has been put into operation.

[Agence France-Presse, Ludwigshafen, 28th Dispatch] An unprecedentedly large explosion occurred at the Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (formerly IG Farben plant) in Mannheim on the banks of the Rhine this afternoon. Technicians said: The recent heat wave may be the main reason for the chemical explosion. However, the real cause has not yet been determined.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th Dispatch] Leipzig Radio in the Soviet zone broadcast that the French authorities may have used the Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik to manufacture explosives, which caused the unprecedented explosion. According to estimates in the broadcast, more than 600 people died and 1,400 were injured in the explosion.

### Soviet Union Dumps Gold in Hong Kong

[United Press International, Hong Kong, 28th] The Far Eastern Economic Review reported on the 28th that the Soviet Union's dumping of its gold production may put the world gold market in an embarrassing situation and cause "great concern" among the US Treasury Department, gold producers, and investors. Soviet gold bricks with clear Soviet markings have appeared in the market. Recently, a batch of Soviet gold bricks arrived here from The Hague. These gold bricks were purchased by brokers in the open market in The Hague.

### Stalin's War Plan as Recounted by a Soviet Veteran (Part 1)

— Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper

(Editor's note: This article originally appeared in the July issue of Reader's Digest in the United States. The author, Mr. Koepple, is a recently retired Soviet officer currently residing in Paris.)

The Soviet Union recognized earlier than the United States that the Cold War between the two countries had reached its peak, and what would follow would be outright military war. The coup in Czechoslovakia was a step taken by the Communist Party. Other actions, such as accelerating the civil wars in Greece and China, were also tactics to force a final showdown.

As a Soviet officer, I had the opportunity to learn about the content of the Soviet war plan. This war plan, unlike the purely defensive war plans of other world powers, is a plan for taking the initiative to attack.

Undeniably, the Soviet Union does not need war. However, the figures in the Kremlin believe that regardless of whether the Soviet Union needs war, the conflict will eventually come. Because of this belief, they urgently need to prepare a plan on how to launch an attack first.

The Soviet General Staff believes that the future Third World War will be divided into three main stages.

First Stage

First, quickly occupy Western Europe. The Soviet Union believes that with its strong military strength, this can be completed within three weeks.

Second Stage

During this stage, the Soviet Union needs to complete the following steps simultaneously. First, after occupying Western Europe, it will attack the Iberian Peninsula, cross the Mediterranean to the south, and wedge into North Africa. At the same time, it will also attack Iran, Iraq, and Syria, pointing its spearhead at the Suez Canal. Then, it will launch an attack on Franco.

In the Spanish war, with the support of the exiled Republican government in Western Europe and the anti-Franco people in Spain, the Soviet army can easily achieve victory. After resolving Franco, the Soviet army will attack Dakar, an important Atlantic port in French North Africa. Once this area is occupied, the entire South America will be directly threatened.

Contrary to outside speculation, the Soviet Union does not intend to use an attack on Turkey as a springboard to invade the Suez Canal. The Soviet army will use Turkey as a secondary target and detour to seize Gibraltar, eliminating the military role of the Mediterranean.

It is estimated that the Soviet Union can complete the above tasks in three months.

After reaching the above steps, and before the third stage arrives, the Soviet Union will do its best to defend the two wings of Europe to prevent attacks from Britain. This defensive plan requires one hundred divisions to achieve. Half of these one hundred divisions will be borne by the Czech, Polish, and Southern European countries respectively.

Third Stage

This is the final stage of the entire war. The Soviet army will directly attack the Far East, and the decisive war may begin within China. The Soviet Union will supplement the Chinese Communist army with three hundred divisions. The Soviet side estimates that the entire Asian war can be concluded within two years.

Conquering China

After conquering China, the Soviet Union will propose a peace proposal to the United States, dividing the two major spheres of influence. Europe (excluding Britain), the Near East, the Middle East, North Africa, China, and other regions belong to the Soviet Union. India, Vietnam, Indonesia, South America, Britain, and its colonies belong to the United States.

Atomic Bomb

Regarding the atomic bomb, the Soviet Union will use the method of dispersing military supplies to resist atomic bombing. At the same time, Soviet scientists have fully learned how to manufacture atomic bombs, but they lack the industrial equipment to produce atomic bombs. However, one of the three major atomic bomb factories in their plan is under construction, and these atomic bomb factories are all located in central Siberia. Atomic bombs may be produced before the end of this year.

### The Way to Balance Municipal Finances is to Rectify Tax Collection; Tian Yongqian Returns to Shanghai After Completing Official Duties in Nanjing

[Reported by this newspaper] Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after completing his official duties in Nanjing, having traveled to Nanjing twice on the 20th and 26th of this month to request subsidies from the central government due to the city's financial deficit. It is reported that the Executive Yuan's Budget Committee has decided to grant a one-time subsidy of 1.4 trillion yuan. The municipal finances had been self-sufficient in the past eight months, but the situation was quite different this month, and the additional half-month salary for June was issued to public education personnel, causing the municipal treasury to be unable to bear the burden. However, the Finance Bureau believes that, based on the current situation, rectifying tax collection is still the only solution, but it is not appropriate to target property tax and license tax for the time being.

### A Tragic Scene on the Hai Gui Wheel; Death and Ruined Family, Widow Seeks Relatives; Seduced on the Journey, Sadly Leaping into the Sea in Grief

[Reported by this newspaper] On the China Merchants Bureau's Hai Gui Wheel, which was returning to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao via Tianjin this time, a female passenger committed suicide by jumping into the sea mid-journey. The captain, upon learning of this, immediately launched an investigation, and as a result, found three suspects in this case: Wang Mingquan, Liu Zhenfei, and Xie Rongsheng, and immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Bureau to report. After receiving the telegram, the bureau ordered the police to dispatch personnel to the dock to wait and arrest them. The wheel arrived at the port at 10:00 AM yesterday and docked at Pier No. 7 (formerly the Mitsubishi Pier). Police officers boarded the wheel and arrested the three suspects, Wang and others, and took them to the Police Division on the second floor of the bureau for temporary detention, and began interrogation at about 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It is reported that the woman who committed suicide by jumping into the sea was named Du Zhijie (alias Peng Huizhen), a native of Yingkou, about 30 years old. Her father, Du Jiantang, was formerly the district chief. When Yingkou fell, the whole family

was captured by bandits. This time, the woman was entrusted by her father to a friend, Wang Mingquan, to bring her to Shanghai to seek relatives. Wang was an employee of the Ministry of Communications stationed in Qinhuangdao and happened to be transferred to Guangzhou, so he came to Shanghai to transfer to Guangdong. Du's father entrusted him to accompany his daughter to Shanghai on the way. The woman met a Liu Zhenfei on the ship, who was a major intelligence officer of the Ministry of National Defense, accompanied by his follower Xie Rongsheng, who were taking the wheel to Shanghai to go to Nanjing. Liu was young and beautiful, and the two

fell in love at first sight. They spent day and night together on the ship, and a secret relationship developed. Wang Mingquan witnessed Du and Liu's improper behavior, so he advised Du. Not only did Du not heed the advice, but she said that she was willing to give herself to Liu and was willing to sacrifice everything. Wang was furious when he heard this and immediately threatened that after arriving in Shanghai, he would tell her relatives the whole story, and said that he would report the woman's ginseng, weighing ten pounds, and many pieces of clothing to the police, the military police, and the customs. After being threatened, Du made a big scene on the ship, which inevitably made her the laughingstock of the passengers on the ship, which caused her to be deeply stimulated. It was also heard that the woman had been married for only a little over a year three years ago, and her husband died. In addition, Yingkou fell, and the whole family was captured by bandits, and their property was robbed. Various stimuli gathered in her heart, and she suddenly developed a pessimistic view of life. The wheel left Dalian for Shanghai on the morning of the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, Du

was reported missing. It was only after investigation that she was known to have　committed suicide by leaping into the sea.

The Police Division later found out that Du had an elder cousin, Du Boen, who was practicing law in Shanghai, and telegraphed the Lawyers Association to inquire about Du's lawyer's residence before inviting Du to the bureau. Du arrived at the Police Division at about 4:00 PM, just as the interrogation was underway. The interrogation was completed at about 5:00 PM, and the three criminals were temporarily detained in the Police Division, pending Du's lawyer's opinion, before　transferring them to the local　detention center, and the list of Du's　belongings　left behind was handed over to Du's lawyer, so that they could　be　claimed in the future. Among them, ten pounds of ginseng and many pieces of clothing have already

disappeared. The group is also investigating. Later, the reporter went to Du's lawyer's office to inquire about his opinion on the crowd. According to Du's lawyer, he had no words to answer regarding his cousin's case. Because he had not heard of their coming south beforehand, and he had been separated from his hometown for more than ten years without any news, he was still studying the disposition of the three suspects and only needed to give an explanation to his uncle (referring to Du's father).

### Good Management Committee Tenders for Fishing Wheels; The Fishing Industry Decides to Refuse Bidding; Receives Reporters and Criticizes the Unreasonable Method

[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, the Post-War Rehabilitation and Management Committee published an advertisement for the tender of twenty mobile fishing wheels, post-war rehabilitation materials for the fishing industry. The private fishing industry in this city refused to bid, as the vessels, nominally fishing wheels, were actually vessels that could not go out to fish, and the contract methods stipulated were quite unreasonable. Yesterday afternoon, the Fishing Wheel Business Association hosted reporters and called for justice. According to Chairman Hu Shiyuan and others: (1) These twenty vessels were originally ordered from Australia by the U.S. military during the Pacific War as transportation tools between bird islands and have not undergone reconstruction work. There are no fishing tools on board, no ice fish equipment on the boats, the engine speed is too fast, the gears are not suitable for trawling, and the load capacity is too small, which is not in line with fishing economics. (2) The contract stipulates that the English version shall prevail, which is detrimental to the national image. Among them, the vessels handed over to the government for safekeeping are referred to as the government's transfer of ownership, and the payment method is to convert U.S. dollars into national currency. In addition to paying one-twentieth in advance, nineteen promissory notes are paid, with the face value in national currency, but they are guaranteed to adjust the exchange rate difference at any time, and must be guaranteed by a designated bank for a period of five years. This method cannot be done by any bank. Private fishing believes that the Good Management Committee is simply not sincere in selling in this way, so it requests to form a technical committee with representatives from the fishing company to identify the performance of the fishing vessels and then conduct an open and reasonable research distribution to quell disputes.

### Establishing Secret Accounts and Engaging in Commerce; China Industrial and Mining Bank; Ordered to Suspend Business; Previous and Incumbent Managers to be Investigated According to Law

[Reported by this newspaper] The General Management Office of the China Industrial and Mining Bank in this city formulated temporary measures for secret account accounting, circulated them to various branches for implementation, and repeatedly set up secret accounts, established other names, misappropriated bank funds, and engaged in commerce. Most of its business focus was hidden in the secret accounts. After investigation and verification by the Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau, it was determined that the bank's illegal operation violated the provisions of Article 43 of the Banking Law. The original documents have been attached and sent to the Shanghai Local Court to investigate the previous and current general managers of the bank according to law. It also ordered the Shanghai Branch to suspend business during the period of the court's investigation and await sentencing. During the suspension period, in addition to recovering or paying off existing creditor's rights and debts, it shall not accept any new business.

Deposit Withdrawals Exceed 90%

[Reported by this newspaper] The person in charge of the China Industrial and Mining Bank stated yesterday that they would abide by the authorities' suspension order and clear the accounts immediately. In one day yesterday, more than 90% of the customer deposits were withdrawn. The person in charge also believed that the Ministry of Finance's decisive action against the bank this time was based solely on a one-sided report from the Financial Administration Bureau and lacked factual evidence. However, now that the case has been handed over to the local court for investigation, the truth will surely come to light in the future.

Interview with the Shanghai Branch Manager

Also, according to Wu Kejun, manager of the Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial and Mining Bank, most of the bank's funds are overseas Chinese funds. The former General Manager, Zhai Wenqiao, also served as the manager of the Shanghai Branch. During Zhai's tenure, he did use his authority to take unreasonable measures. Subsequently, the bank's board of directors resolved that Zhai Wenqiao would no longer serve as the manager of the Shanghai Branch, and Qu Shiduo took over. During Qu's tenure, he made every effort to improve the business of the Shanghai Branch. Wu took over until December of last year. The General Manager of the Head Office was also replaced by Zhou Shiguan in February of this year. At 7:00 PM on the 28th, the bank received an order from the Financial Administration Bureau to suspend business. The bank has issued an order to suspend business, and the deposits of all more than 4,000 depositors, totaling more than 500 billion, have been decided to be fully repaid in the next two days to maintain credit.

### Five Robbers Steal Car and Drive to Suzhou, Robbing Pedestrians Along the Way; Military Police in Various Locations Search and Arrest; Arrested in Lili Town

[Our Newspaper's Suzhou, 29th Report] A Shanghai Xiang Sheng Company business car, license plate number 03:3264, was hijacked by bandits in Shanghai at around midnight this morning and driven to Suzhou along the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway. There were a total of five bandits, two wearing military uniforms and three in plainclothes, carrying a six-inch Browning pistol. Shortly after the car started, the Xiang Sheng driver was forced out, and the bandits drove themselves. At 4:40 AM, the car arrived outside Panmen, Suzhou, and encountered vegetable vendors heading to the market. They immediately stopped and robbed them, but the loot was meager. The bandits then turned onto the Suzhou-Jiashan Highway, arbitrarily stopping and robbing pedestrians along the way. According to reports to the police, a vendor in Maoshantang, Wujiang County, was robbed of three gold rings, three pairs of earrings, and 7.3 million yuan in cash. A cloth merchant in Longqiao, Bachi Jian, was robbed of 80 million yuan, and so on. Upon receiving the reports, military police organs along the road urgently notified various locations by telephone to search and arrest. Unexpectedly, when the bandits' car passed the Zhujiang Bridge in Shengze, it happened to meet a Suzhou-Jiashan long-distance bus. Due to the narrow road, the bandits' car was driven carelessly and overturned into a field, but there was no damage. The bandits scrambled out, abandoned the car, and fled southwest of Shengze with the loot. By the time nearby military police arrived after receiving the report, they were unable to pursue them. At around 3:00 PM, Shao Jintang, a government police officer from Wujiang County, was working in Lili Town when he discovered five diners at a small restaurant acting suspiciously. Suspecting that they were bandits, he reported them to the local police station, who arrested them. Firearms and stolen goods were found, and they immediately confessed. The names of the five bandits are Xuan Limin, Fu Huimin, Sun Haofu, Yao Heshang, and Jin Rongchang, who all admitted to the roadside robbery. They also confessed that they originally planned to drive the car to Hangzhou via Jiaxing and rob along the way, hoping to gain more loot, but they were stopped by the overturned car.

According to reports, the business car belongs to the seventh station of the Xiang Sheng Motor Company at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Yuyuan Road. The previous night, driver Chen Weipu was dispatched in response to a customer's call. When he arrived at the intersection of Daxilu and Jing'an Temple Road, five men flagged down the car, instructing him to drive to Beixin Jing. En route, the five passengers suddenly pulled out guns and threatened to force the driver out of the car. They tied his hands and feet with rope, dragged him into the fields, and then drove off to the west. Afterwards, Chen Weipu struggled to break free from the rope and reported the incident to the Chenjiaqiao police station of the police precinct, requesting them to pursue the bandits.

### Chen A'wu's Illness Is Not True Cholera: Confirmed by the Health Bureau

### Military Supplies for Bandits: Three Key Suspects Escorted to Nanjing; District Office Clerk Acts as Mediator; Two Bank Employees Deceived

The city's public security agency recently uncovered a case of military supplies being provided to bandits. Three key suspects, including Zhao Xijin, have been arrested. The agency has recently received confidential reports that Zhao Xijin, the accounting director of the Pudong Nanhui Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and Xia Yan, an employee of the bank, are using their positions as bank employees as cover to secretly collude with communist bandits and provide them with military supplies. The agency sent personnel to Pudong to investigate secretly and confirmed the reports. They arrested the two suspects and learned from their confessions that Yao Haoran, a clerk in the district office, had mediated their collusion with the communist bandits. Based on the confession, the agency immediately sent personnel to arrest Yao at his address. The suspects' crimes were repeatedly purchasing and transporting military supplies to the bandit area in the name of the Self-Defense Forces needing to purchase firearms, with a very large amount involved. The authorities, considering the seriousness of the case and its wide-ranging implications, have transferred the three key suspects to Nanjing for interrogation this morning and are continuing to investigate.

### Elementary School Apprentice Acts as Ghost: Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop Terrified; Three Mysterious Fires Falsely Claimed to Be "Medicine God Great Thief"; Four Notes Left, Handwriting Analysis Solves the Case

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ye Shudetang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop, located at 76 Xizang South Road, is owned by Ding Jiwan, a national representative and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner. Qiu Ningsheng is employed as the manager, and there are more than thirty employees and students. In the past month, the shop has experienced three or four fire alarms, causing suspicion and panic.

The first time was at 10:05 PM on June 22nd. After the fire was discovered, it burned until 12:10 AM before being extinguished. The entire front of the two-story warehouse was destroyed, and the doors and windows of the three-story building were also damaged by the fire. Fortunately, there was a sky bridge separating the shop, which was not affected. The manager's bedroom was inside the warehouse, and he was seriously injured while escaping the fire. What was strange was that there were a total of three fire locations, with the other two on the upper floor of the shop. These were extinguished by the shop staff, preventing a major disaster.

The second time was at 9:00 PM on July 10th, when a fire suddenly broke out in the storage room on the second floor of the shop. The doors and windows are usually locked, and there are no flammable materials inside the medicinal materials, so the cause was completely unknown. Fortunately, the fire brigade arrived in time, and the loss was minimal.

The third time was only a few days later, when a burning White Tin cigarette, a box of matches, and a pile of scattered matchsticks and hemp stalks were found on a shelf in the fine materials room. It was clear that they were prepared for ignition to cause a fire. Fortunately, precautions had been taken, and it was discovered early, so it was extinguished. However, after searching the shop, no one smoked White Tin cigarettes, which increased their worries.

Whole Shop in Turmoil: Patrols Day and Night

Afterwards, the owner, manager, shop staff, and apprentices were alarmed and disturbed, and the entire shop was in an uproar. There were special buyers monitoring during the day, and patrols were assigned in shifts at night. Everyone's mood was in a state of terror. Strange notes were successively found in the shop. The tone was similar to that of a god or ghost, and the intention was both a warning and a threat. The first note vaguely stated, "Quickly remove the manager, three apprentices, and two employees surnamed Huang and Zhang, or I will burn people to death and turn the shop to ashes."

The second note vaguely stated, "I am the Medicine God. Your days are numbered. You haven't left yet? How dare you? What's the use of begging my sister? Now I forgive you for removing two colleagues and elementary school students. If you don't leave, I will be rude, and a fierce fire will be born. Wait three more days, special notice."

Doors and Windows Not Opened: Notes Appear Suddenly

The third note was vague. The fourth note was found in the bedroom of accountant Ma Huiren, which was even more bizarre. The accountant patrolled all night, and checked the books and miscellaneous items on the table at 5 AM, and found nothing. But at 8 AM, the doors and windows were closed as before, and the fourth strange note was found under the books, saying: "I am not the Medicine God, I am an unknown great thief. My father had a feud with the shop owner, so I came to seek revenge. Before the appointed day, everyone must leave, or I will burn you alive and turn the shop to ashes. I am the great thief Hua Mazhong."

Handwriting Analysis: Find Clues

Zhang, the deputy director of the Municipal Police Bureau, and Chen Zhiqing, the director of the Songshan branch bureau in charge, attached great importance to this case and repeatedly ordered Chen Kaizhou, the head of the judicial affairs section, to step up the investigation and solve the case within a time limit. Chen, under orders, investigated day and night, and finally arrested the self-proclaimed "great thief" at 4:00 PM on the 26th of this month, and brought him to the bureau for interrogation.

Chen's work focused entirely on the handwriting. The handwriting on all four strange notes was intentionally made to look like a seal script, making it difficult to recognize. However, the original form was still retained in the structure of the characters. For example, the lower left side of the character "san" (散) was written as the character "ri" (日), and the "bu" (不) radical in the character "shen" (神) was mistakenly written as the "yi" (衣) radical. The top of the character "dian" (店) should be "guang" (广), but it was also mistakenly written as "guang" (廣). Among the thirty shop employees, each person's handwriting was compared, and any daily left writings were collected as much as possible. Only Shen Zenghua, an apprentice, showed these characteristics.

Intending to Leave: Reckless Thoughts Arise

Shen Zenghua is eighteen years old, from Ningbo. His father died and his mother remarried, leaving him poor and helpless. He studied for three to five years in his youth and was introduced to Ye Shudetang by someone. According to his confession: he admitted that he set the three fires and left the four notes alone, with no accomplices. The reason was that the work was too hard, the treatment was poor, and two other apprentices bullied him too much. He wanted to quit and find another job, but he was afraid that the original recommender would blame him and not look for another job, so he wanted to scare the shop owner into disbanding the entire shop or dismissing the apprentices, so that he could achieve his goal without admitting his mistakes. As for setting the fire, he had no malicious intent to burn it down. Each time after setting the fire, he was the first to shout and the first to fetch water to put it out. He claimed he was the one who saved the manager from being burned to death by calling out and helping him escape.

The police bureau, based on the confession and verification, believes that Shen Zenghua's arson crime is beyond doubt, but they are still investigating the reasons for the crime, whether it was a long-standing grudge or simply so simple.

### Road Bureau Seriously Selects Future Transportation Personnel

The two Road Bureaus recently opened a training course for transportation personnel, which was publicly advertised on the 14th of this month. The qualifications were limited to high school graduates, and 200 people were selected. More than 2,000 people applied for the examination. The bureau's director, Chen, in order to select true talents, assigned section-level officials in the bureau to review the examination papers in the meeting room during their spare time from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day. He also invited the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy to send personnel to the bureau to supervise and prevent private malpractice such as "solicitation". During the paper review, all section heads were not allowed to receive guests, nor were they allowed to take the examination papers out of the meeting room. After 12:00 PM, all the reviewed papers were sealed with fire lacquer by the supervisor. The section heads humorously called this one hour of time "a fixed-term imprisonment," which they deemed a great hardship.

Afterwards, Zhao became angry out of shame and gathered more than a dozen members of the "Bo Dao Gang" (Knife Gang).

Yesterday, the defendant first recounted the circumstances of the wife's death. Afterwards, Zhou Liwen was questioned as a witness. Zhou wore a checkered silk cheongsam and white leather shoes. Standing in the witness stand, she often burst into tears. She stated: "During the Anti-Japanese War, the defendant worked with my brother and that is how we met. We got married in Qishan, Sichuan, in April of the 34th year of the Republic of China. At that time, I didn't know that the defendant was already married. At the end of May, the defendant's younger brother and sister-in-law brought a boy, saying that he was the defendant's nephew. Only now do I know that he is his own flesh and blood." Zhou Liwen's biological mother, Zhou He, was summoned again. She stated: "One night, Chen Xiwu brought a man in military uniform to my house, saying that he had accidentally injured his foot.

### President Chiang’s Summer Retreat in Moganshan

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng

[Special Dispatch from Moganshan, This Newspaper, 27th] Moganshan, a summer resort located in the western part of Zhejiang Province, boasts lush bamboo forests and a tranquil environment. Through years of development by both Chinese and foreigners, it has grown to a considerable scale. During the war, it suffered from the impact of the conflict. After the war, the Zhejiang Provincial Government established a special bureau to manage it, hoping to attract Chinese and foreign visitors. This year, we have already reported in our articles that Moganshan is thriving and undergoing construction. At this moment, President Chiang's sudden visit to the mountain for a summer retreat has undoubtedly added immeasurable encouragement to Moganshan's development.

President Chiang made the decision to come to Moganshan on the 26th. Two months ago, there were rumors in Moganshan, and various preparations were being made, but these were just rumors. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 26th, Madame Chiang flew from Shanghai to Nanjing. On the afternoon of the 26th, the President also received Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi. In the afternoon, he decided to fly to Hangzhou with his wife and then proceed to Moganshan.

Arrived Directly at Gengcun Without Rest

Beforehand, Chiang Ching-kuo and Yu Jishi arrived in Hangzhou, busily arranging the President's official residence. They also notified Wang Zhengyi, the director of the Moganshan Administration Bureau, to prepare immediately. Wang only learned about it around noon on the 26th and rushed up the mountain to prepare. During Chiang Ching-kuo's stay in Hangzhou, many friends asked him: "Is the Old Man coming?" He would only smile.

Director Yu feared that publicizing the news would prevent the President from having a peaceful rest. News reporters had already obtained clues around 1:00 PM that day. In the afternoon, there were many phone calls, and the relevant authorities were tight-lipped. It was confirmed that the President had arrived in Hangzhou by 5:00 PM. They did not rest in the prepared official residence but went directly to Gengcun, at the foot of Moganshan, arriving at 7:30 PM.

The Official Residence is Surrounded by Quiet Pine Forests

The Administration Bureau prepared sedan chairs, inviting the President and his wife to ascend the mountain. The sedan chairs were modeled after those on Lushan, carried by four people. It is said that the porters had also undergone training beforehand.

The President's residence is located at No. 550, Wulin Village, commonly known as No. 550, Ridge Top. The terrain there is high, and the buildings are not complicated, with only a few structures. The President's official residence belongs to Chen Yongqing, a director of the Shanghai Zhejiang Industrial Bank. The house has sanitary facilities, a reception room, and living quarters for servants. It is surrounded by neat pine forests, creating a quiet and secluded atmosphere. It truly embodies the saying: "Sitting quietly, one dislikes the noise of the flowing water; gazing leisurely, one finds fault with the busyness of the white clouds."

The President and his wife arrived on the mountain around 8:00 PM. Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian and Chiang Ching-kuo accompanied them up the mountain. Because it was late, even Mayor Zhou's personal items, such as cigarettes and a lighter, were not delivered to the mountain.

Met Many People in the Mountains for Two Days

He has been on the mountain for two days. Besides meeting with Zhejiang Chairman Chen Yi, Pacification Director Tang Enbo, and Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Speaker Zhang Qiang, the rest of the time has been spent resting. He and his wife sometimes stroll near the official residence, sometimes walk down the mountain and wander along the mountain paths, and sometimes visit Sword Pond to see where Gan Jiang and Mo Ye forged their swords. Sometimes he sits quietly in the official residence, appearing quite leisurely and content.

On Moganshan, where "good flowers in every stream are like quiet maidens, and strange rocks on many peaks resemble flying immortals," although the mountain's grandeur and scale are smaller than those of Lushan, it possesses its own delicate and exquisite charm. This is President Chiang's third visit to Moganshan. The first was for Huang Fu's burial, and the second was also for a visit, but he only reached the entrance of Tasan Park before turning back. However, both of these trips were day trips, unlike this one, where he has stayed longer.

Electric Lights Replaced by Candles

The mountain originally had electric lights, but the equipment was removed after the war against Japan and has not been reinstalled. Therefore, gasoline lamps were used in the official residence, but the President found them to have a slight kerosene smell and switched to candles. Residents from near and far, both Chinese and foreign, have been waiting at various scenic spots every day, hoping to catch a glimpse of him. On the evening of the 27th, he was spotted by reporters while strolling on the road by the mountain. He frequently greeted us and asked, "Are you here to play? Are you having a good time?"

Prices on the mountain are similar to those in Hangzhou, but Gengcun is much more expensive. A plate of fried rice costs 800,000 yuan, and lodging for one person (without a proper room, just temporary accommodation) costs 1.5 million yuan. Hiring a car costs 1 million yuan.

Many Foreign Tourists on the Mountain

There are many foreigners on the mountain. Most of the women wear shorts and bras, and most of the men wear shorts and collared T-shirts. When they see the President, they stand at attention and salute.

The only financial institution on the mountain is the Zhejiang Commercial and Savings Bank, managed by Mr. Li Xiaowen, who is very friendly. The postal and telecommunications facilities are also well-established, managed by Mr. Wu Nanshi and three others. After the President arrived on the mountain, these four were extremely busy, but thanks to their hard work, telecommunications remained smooth and unimpeded.

According to sources, the President does not intend to stay long on the mountain, but seeing the continuous installation of telecommunications equipment and the gradual strengthening of security forces, whether he will stay longer is a question that news reporters are pursuing.

Cicadas all over the mountain are drumming their wings, diligently calling "Zhī liǎo, zhī liǎo, zhī liǎo" (I know, I know, I know), mixed with the tinkling sound of water washing down the streams, weaving a beautiful melody.

[Dispatch from Ningbo, This Newspaper, 29th] A shocking murder case involving 22 stabs occurred yesterday at No. 7, Shewei Alley, outside the South Gate. Resident Cao Shuangcai's eldest daughter, Amao, had previously lived with Shu Huilin in Shanghai, but returned to the city due to emotional discord and lived with Wu Caifa, a squadron leader of the Ninghai Regiment Management District.

### Dikes Collapsed in Thirteen Counties Along the Yangtze River in Anhui, Severe Disaster Situation

[Airmail Dispatch from Anqing, This Newspaper, 28th] Sheng Decun of the Anhui Water Conservancy Bureau stated that the Yangtze River embankments in Anhui Province are divided into three sections: Huayang, Anqing, and Guichi. The First Repair and Defense Office oversees the four counties of Huayang, Susong, Wangjiang, and Dongzhi. The Second Repair and Defense Office oversees the four counties of Huaining, Tongcheng, Guichi, and Tongling. The Third Repair and Defense Office oversees the five counties of Wuwei, He County, Fanchang, Wuhu, and Dangtu. The above thirteen counties have a total of sixty-eight dikes, both large and small, along the Yangtze River, benefiting 1.2 million mu of farmland and with a total embankment length of over 1,000 li. The disaster situation in the first and second defense offices is particularly severe and tragic. He has reported to the Ministry of Social Affairs for urgent disaster relief. The affected farmland in various areas includes 3 million mu in Tongma Dike, 100,000 mu in Wangjiang Synthetic Dike, 1,000 mu in Hexing Dike, 10,000 mu in Dongxing Dike, 2,000 mu in Taishun Dike, 1,000 mu in Shunquan Dike, 6,000 mu in Dongzhi Yufeng Dike, 300 mu in Lansheng Dike, 2,000 mu in Yicheng Dike, 4,000 mu in Guichi Wanxing Dike, 2,000 mu in Minsheng Dike, 8,000 mu in Shangquan Cheng Dike, 5,000 mu in Datongyi Dike, and 1,000 mu in Fanchang Guangda Dike. The collapse situation can be roughly divided into: (1) Over 400,000 mu have been devastated by the collapse. (2) About 30% of the entire area, or over 3 million mu, have been flooded due to the inability of internal water to drain. (3) The farmland devastated by the collapse of inland river embankments and the inundated beaches along the Yangtze River is ten times greater than the above two categories. Various types of devastated farmland total approximately 450,000 mu. In the Susong area of Tongma Dike in Anhui, over 2,600 qing of farmland in 37 water villages have been submerged, affecting over 200,000 people, who are gathering in the county seat, desperately seeking relief.

Another report: From Waigouerkou in the west of the county to Guangji Bridge in the urban area, the water level is 4-5 chi high. The deepest parts, such as along Changtong'anmen Gulou, are about 6-7 chi. Over 100 houses and shops are submerged in water. Guangfeng Rice Mill and other businesses have mostly closed down on their own. Ferrying boats in the urban area are thriving. The evening smoke rises in wisps, and the sound of oars never ceases, like entering a desolate village inn. In recent days, people have been submerged by the water and have no means of livelihood. About a dozen women, the elderly, and children have died.

### Refusal to Vacate After Lease Expiration: Housing Dispute Goes to Court

Mr. Wu asks: I have a house in Shanghai that I rented to a certain person. The lease expired in January of this year, but the tenant refuses to move out, leading to a court case. The court ruled that the defendant should move out within a certain number of months and granted provisional execution. I have several questions that I would appreciate answers to: (1) During the eviction period, can I still collect the rent as before? Can it be settled together during execution? (2) Provisional execution has been ruled, but it has not been executed yet. Can I apply to the court again? If I cannot provide a reliable shop guarantee, what should I do? (3) The sun deck in the house is damaged, and the defendant refuses to repair it, resulting in its collapse. Is the defendant liable for compensation? The lease states that "the tenant shall maintain the house in good condition and shall not allow others or themselves to damage it."

[Lawyer Jiang Fan answers] (1) The rent during the eviction period can of course be collected. If there is no mention of rent payment in the judgment, it cannot be enforced together. (2) If the judgment states that provisional execution is granted after providing a guarantee, it should be handled according to the judgment. (3) According to the law, the tenant can be required to compensate or restore the original condition.

### After Implementation of the New Law on Opening Up Self-Provided Foreign Exchange, the Quota System is Still Maintained; Detailed Implementation Rules are Being Approved by the Executive Yuan

[This Newspaper] Huo Baoshu, Chairman of the Export-Import Control Commission, hosted a meeting with import and export merchants and the press at 4:00 PM yesterday on the fourth floor of the Bank of China to provide a detailed supplementary explanation of the measures for overseas Chinese capital and domestic funds investing in domestic production enterprises and to provide brief answers to various questions. Chairman Huo's full report is as follows:

"The Executive Yuan passed the measures for overseas Chinese capital and domestic funds investing in domestic production enterprises at its eighth meeting on the 21st of this month, and it has been announced in the newspapers. We can briefly explain the spirit of the measures:

(1) Supplementing Production Tools: Over the past ten years, domestic production enterprises have suffered repeated destruction and urgently need to be supplemented and restored. During the war, many domestic factories ordered machinery from abroad, which urgently needs to be imported at this time. Overseas Chinese who hope to invest in domestic production enterprises should be facilitated.

(2) Supplementing Production Raw Materials: Article 8 of these measures stipulates that overseas Chinese capital is allowed to bring back the main raw materials needed domestically. Please see the attached table for the list of raw materials. These raw materials are lacking domestically and are not included in US aid, while the places where overseas Chinese reside are the main production areas.

(3) Coordinating with Domestic Industrial Needs: The raw materials listed in the currently announced attached table are those that are extremely lacking domestically. In the future, the announcement will still be coordinated with industrial needs. Those that are sufficient domestically will not be imported, and those that are lacking will be supplemented.

(4) The Quota System is Still Maintained: The purpose of these measures is to supplement the shortage of industrial raw materials. Because domestic raw materials are extremely lacking, the quota system will still be maintained.

(5) Simple Procedures: These measures do not add any procedures for applicants other than preparing a plan and a business estimate. If the applicant cannot handle the import themselves, they can entrust it to a qualified importer.

(6) Careful Review: These applications will first be reviewed by the competent ministries and commissions within a time limit. After the competent ministries and commissions review them, they will be submitted to the Commission. The Commission will establish a special committee to review them carefully. However, the review time must be fast to ensure that applicants receive a response to their application within the shortest possible time. However, applicants must pay attention to preparing all the necessary documents in accordance with the regulations when submitting them to the ministries and commissions for review to avoid the delay in the review time due to official correspondence.

Attached Table: The raw materials allowed to be imported are limited to the following items: rice, wheat, flour, cotton, wool, ramie and burlap bags, ramie grass, raw rubber and tires, wood and sleepers, fertilizer, gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil, coal, coke, paper and pulp, coconut oil, and raw materials for special medicines.

### Supplementary Explanation

After Huo's report, Chen Junren, Fang Yuanxian, Shen Zouting, and Huang Qinghua, the chiefs of the respective sections, continued to provide supplementary explanations on various technical issues, as follows:

(1) The raw materials and equipment purchased and transported back to China with domestic funds by Chinese citizens abroad can only be used for their own use and cannot be sold. This is the difference between them and overseas Chinese capital. In the future, the Export-Import Control Commission intends to join hands with relevant agencies to form an assessment committee to supervise the use of domestic funds returning to China after overseas funds return to China and prevent the illegal export of raw materials, etc.

(2) The one hundred and ten-odd kinds of raw materials and materials that are permitted to be imported under these measures are simple in nature, lacking domestically, and easy for overseas Chinese to purchase locally. Although materials such as hardware and chemicals are needed domestically, they are temporarily not allowed to be imported due to their complex nature.

(3) In the future, the procedures for overseas Chinese capital to apply for purchasing and transporting materials will be simplified and expedited. The review time for the competent ministries and commissions will not exceed two months, and the Export-Import Control Commission will establish a special team to handle this matter. Once the review is completed, a permit will be issued.

(4) There have been two opposing theories in the past as to whether to open up foreign exchange for self-provided items. The measures currently implemented enable factories to obtain the raw materials they need and, at the same time, avoid the drawbacks that may arise from opening up.

### Brief Answers

After the chiefs of each section gave their explanations, import and export industries and news reporters asked questions, which were answered briefly by Chairman Huo himself. What he said of his vehicle is recorded as follows:

(1) The current measures can be used as a test. When the results are good, they can be slowly relaxed until they are fully opened. The government is concerned about the market after the opening of foreign exchange, so the current measures cannot but have considerable restrictions.

(2) Foreign merchants who have already established factories in China can handle them in accordance with these measures. As for newly arrived foreign capital, it will be handled separately.

(3) Whether funds from Hong Kong and Macao can be used as overseas Chinese capital is a matter on which the Executive Yuan has not given clear instructions. Since there is no need for passports for travel between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao, and they cannot be regarded as foreign territories, the handling of funds from Hong Kong and Macao needs to be studied and determined after consultation with the industrial and trade sectors. After Huo's answer, Zhang Yaozhang and Hong Nianzu expressed their opinions from the perspectives of the import and export and industrial sectors. Huo agreed to study and consider them with people from both industries. The reception ended at 6:00 PM.

### Cotton Yarn Merchants Request the Cotton Yarn Committee to Improve the Yarn Throwing Method

Difficulty in Obtaining Warehouse Receipts Causes Heavy Losses to Yarn Merchants

[This Newspaper] The Shanghai Cotton Yarn Industry Association has repeatedly received reports from its members that after paying for cotton yarn purchased from the China Textile Construction Corporation, there is often a delay of six or seven days in obtaining the warehouse receipts. The Association has previously sent a letter to the company requesting improvements. Recently, the situation has become even worse. For example, the yarn purchased on the 13th of this month has not yet been obtained warehouse receipt as of today, and the anticipation has lasted for half a month. It is said that yarn merchants purchase cotton yarn mostly for transportation to other ports and to supply practical needs such as the replication of handicrafts. Delays in receiving warehouse receipts delay shipping schedules and cause significant interest losses. Therefore, the Association sent another letter to the Textile Construction Corporation yesterday, requesting prompt improvements.

According to the Cotton Yarn Industry Association: In March of this year, when members of the Association purchased cotton yarn from the Textile Construction Corporation, they had to pay additional consolidated taxes when picking up the goods from each factory. The accumulated amount has been huge over the past few months. The Association has submitted a report to the Cotton Yarn Control Committee, requesting a refund. Although it was approved and instructed to collect it from the original factory, it has not yet been received.

Furthermore, from June 19th to the 30th of this year, the Cotton Yarn Control Committee threw over a thousand bales of yarn. The members of the Association purchased over seven hundred bales of 20-count Heavenly Maiden cotton yarn from the Textile Construction Corporation, with tax payments reaching over 20 billion yuan. The company is now forwarding this to the Cotton Yarn Control Committee and the Central Bank for reimbursement. The yarn merchants are eagerly awaiting an early resolution to avoid further losses.

It is also said that the Central Bank and the Textile Construction Corporation's delays in issuing warehouse receipts are related to the tightening of credit. However, the yarn merchants believe that they have suffered damage as a result and are appealing for relief, lest they be collateral damage.

Slightly Better Yarn Market

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a slight improvement due to the easing of credit. Buyers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions were still active, and the local replication industry was also absorbing yarn, leading to a generally optimistic sentiment.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially jumped by 100 million yuan at the opening. Midway, manufacturers, preparing to pay wages and arrange funds at the end of the month, sold goods in the market for cash, causing the market to fall back by a small amount of 70-80 million yuan. Finally, it closed at 1.88 billion yuan, up 80 million yuan from the previous day. Spot sales were also good, up 50 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn saw recent purchases, with spot sales up 50 million yuan and next-day delivery up 40 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also saw increases ranging from 40 million to 70-80 million yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was only 58 bales.

Stable Cotton Cloth Market

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw stable conditions. Due to the continued easing of credit and the frequent activity of spot yarn from the north in the market, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially jumped by 600,000 yuan at the opening. However, rumors of profit-taking spread, causing a decline in sentiment and prompting selling. Later, strong purchases from Guangdong, Hubei, and the north helped to push prices up, and the platform operators also took the opportunity to raise prices, turning sentiment bullish and pushing prices all the way up to a high of 54 million yuan. Near the close, prices faltered at high levels, and hearing that the yarn market was mediocre and that the buyers had stopped buying and started selling, scattered households sold off, causing the market to fall back to close at 53.6 million yuan, up 4.22 million yuan from the previous day. However, it was later heard that the Textile Construction Corporation had a large supply for sale, and off-market sales fell to 52 million yuan, weaker than the previous day. The markets for other grades of fine cloth and serge also remained strong. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,880 bolts.

[This Newspaper] According to the news group of the Cotton Yarn Control Committee, the dissolution of staff after the Cotton Yarn Control Committee is awaited to be abolished will be handled in accordance with central regulations. The staff also stated that they were not made any requests, contrary to rumors.

### The Bullish Momentum Fails to Last; Chinese Stock Market Conditions are Mediocre

Yesterday, Chinese stocks experienced a surge in activity as speculative capital took advantage of the pre-foreign exchange opening environment. However, the increase was not sustainable. Qin Xing, Jing Lun, and two real estate stocks all briefly reached their limit-up prices, but this did not provide any significant stimulus, and most stocks exhibited a hesitant trend.

The morning started with mediocre performance, with stocks showing mixed results. Yongsha opened at a stable price of 11,450 yuan. Although it advanced to a high of 11,920 yuan through the efforts of numbers 169 and 134, it soon fell back to 11,570 yuan due to selling by numbers 102 and 143. Quanjing, Jing Lun, Lian Di, and Yongye all reached their limit-up prices, and numbers 169 and 176 were still eager to buy, pushing the price to 11,730 yuan. However, actual transactions were limited, and numbers 164 and 89 closed out their positions, causing the price to fall to 11,200 yuan near noon. Numbers 103 and 137 came in to buy, while numbers 99 and 154 made up the difference. The midday close was 11,280 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Yongye and Lian Di remained limit-up, Qin Xing and Jing Lun rebounded after reaching limit-up, and Innerwear rebounded after hitting limit-down, contracting by 10%. With the exception of Xinguang, Shangni, Yonggong, Lian'an, Zhongsi, Shangwu, Zhabei, and Xinhua, which each fell by 0.5%, the remaining stocks experienced only slight fluctuations.

In the afternoon session, although there were rumors of a capital increase for Yongsha, it opened slightly higher at 11,700 yuan. Number 26 sold down to 11,550 yuan, while numbers 129 and 76 continued to buy, and outside investors pushed the price up to 11,800 yuan. Numbers 228 and 51 sold off, causing the price to retreat to 11,480 yuan. State-owned banks performed poorly, and numbers 131 and 95 advanced to 11,700 yuan, while numbers 61 and 116 sold off, closing at 11,570 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Lian Di remained limit-up, Meiya Innerwear, Jing Lun, Yonggong, and Zhongfa rose by 0.5%, Zhabei, Shangwu, Huochai, Lian'an, and Tongyi remained stable, Zhongni experienced a slight setback, and the remaining stocks experienced slight gains. Over-the-counter stocks, especially those in the public utility, cultural, and banking sectors, were relatively weak, while the rest remained stable.

Government Bonds

The market opened lower and continued to decline. Unified C bonds opened at 96,000, but fell to 89,500 before stabilizing somewhat. Compared to the previous close, A and B bonds fell by 40,000 yuan, C and E bonds fell by 70,000 yuan, and D bonds fell by 50,000 yuan. Total trading volume was approximately 1.1 million.

The rice market saw further increases yesterday due to rising prices in Wuxi and a continued loose money supply. Prices for all commodities outside the industry rose, and market sentiment was firm.

Lao Che flour rose to 12.4 million, while Bingchuan opened at 11.3 million and subsequently rose to close at 11.65 million, both up 1.1 million yuan from the previous day. Red Bee and Jiancheng both rose by over 1 million yuan, large bags of bran were 8.7 million, up 500,000, small bags of bran were 6.6 million, and wheat was 15.5 million at the factory gate.

Coarse grains are thriving due to rising prices for all commodities and continued firm market sentiment. Furthermore, arrivals are limited and sellers are few. Soybeans rose by one million yuan, while corn and mung beans saw sluggish sales and stable prices, rising slightly by 500,000. Broad beans and buckwheat each rose by one million yuan, and red sorghum also rose by one million yuan. Sesame from Tianjin saw more shipments, rising sharply by five million yuan. Raw peanuts were scarce and supplies were low, with Guang merchants taking them up, resulting in a sharp increase of ten million yuan.

Edible oil prices rose due to the continued loose money supply and strong intake from retail investors. Furthermore, rising prices across all commodities outside the industry led to firm market sentiment. Soybean oil opened stably but eventually rose to close at 78 million yuan under buying pressure, an increase of 4-5 million yuan. Rapeseed oil was also up 5 million yuan at 73 million, and Jiton raw oil broke through the 100 million yuan mark again, also up 5 million yuan. Small cart sesame oil was 90 million. Soybean cake opened firm but closed weak, rising by 3-400,000 yuan.

### Commercial Briefs

The sugar market is flat and sluggish, with actual sales stagnant. The current price for ninth-period truck white refined sugar warehouse orders is 53.4 million, and local sugar is also sluggish.

The military celebration price of five gallnuts has reached 60 million per ancestral unit. Adding transportation costs to Shanghai and other expenses, the selling price of Shanghai angular gallnuts is 90 million, leaving no profit. Holders are unwilling to sell, and transactions between local and foreign merchants are at a standstill.

Dang ginseng from Shantou has seen a slight increase in procurement, up 200,000 yuan from the previous day. Bai Zhu from Ningbo is being shipped to Shanghai at high prices, but due to a lack of market demand, prices have plummeted.

Cosmetics have seen excessive price increases in recent days, and prices in Han and Gan are inverted, resulting in very limited sales to merchants.

Due to reduced soap prices, industrial oils and waxes have seen very limited shipments. Soap factories and oil refineries are not absorbing inventory, and prices have fallen by over 10%.

Due to weak door sales and limited purchasing power, the leather market has been fluctuating sluggishly in recent days, lacking the strength to rise. High-quality foreign-brand yellow-grain leather from the familiar door is as low as 14 million per foot.

The lumber market remains sluggish in terms of actual sales, but the price of lumber at the lumberyards is firm.

Prices for furs have generally increased by 50%, and prices for yellow weasel fur have doubled, but there have been no formal transactions.

### Amidst Cheers and Fanfares, the British King Declares the Opening of the World Games; 6,000 Athletes Parade, British Athlete Takes the Oath; Banners Flutter, Millions of Residents Cheer from the Sidewalks

[This newspaper's dispatch] London, 29th: The 14th World Games opened Thursday afternoon amidst sharp fanfares. Thousands of spectators gathered in the vast stadium very early, and the weather was exceptionally hot.

[United Press, London, 29th] King George VI of England formally opened the 14th World Games on the 29th in a solemn and magnificent ceremony. Standing in the royal box, draped in blue cloth and adorned with royal gold emblems, the King solemnly declared: "I now announce to the public that the 1948 World Games have begun, marking the 14th World Games in modern times." Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, dressed in navy blue, stood on either side. After 6,000 athletes paraded around the stadium, the King addressed the 75,000 spectators and athletes from various countries, announcing the opening of the World Games. The King and his entourage arrived at Wembley Imperial Stadium after a one-and-a-half-hour drive, where the British Organizing Committee stood respectfully at the entrance to greet them. The Chairman of the Organizing Committee, Lord Birdwood, stepped forward to lead the royal family into the royal box. During the procession, a canopy led the way, and spectators were not allowed to pass through the royal entrance until the King was seated. Led by a hundred buglers, the national teams of athletes marched in formation along World Games Avenue to Wembley. Millions of residents cheered from the sidewalks, and national flags fluttered in the breeze. The cheers were deafening as the largest contingent, the American team of 400 athletes, marched under the Stars and Stripes. The sun rose higher and shone brightly, and the temperature approached 100 degrees, breaking many years of records. The torch, which started in Greece, had traveled nearly 1,500 miles over 12 days to reach its destination. Spectators lined the streets to watch. The earliest spectators to arrive at Wembley were welcomed by the Grenadier Guards band. After the 6,000 athletes entered the stadium, they stood in formation and watched Finley, a British hurdler, take the oath on behalf of all the athletes. Then, Boy Scouts released thousands of carrier pigeons from their bags, following the ancient Greek custom of reporting the start of the World Games to the various nations. Finally, the last torchbearer emerged from a hidden passage and lit the torch inside the stadium, which will burn day and night until the closing ceremony. The first day's program was held on the evening of the 29th at Wembley Imperial Swimming Pool, with two water polo matches: Hungary vs. Egypt and Sweden vs. Switzerland. 50,000 tickets have already been sold for the swimming competitions. The authorities discovered that the program for the evening of the 29th was not full, so they added diving demonstrations and practice sessions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] At 10:30 PM on the 29th, this agency listened to a special broadcast in Chinese from London. The 14th World Games were solemnly opened at 3:30 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on the 29th at Wembley Stadium in London, presided over by King George VI of England. The World Games torch, which had been relayed from southern Greece for 1,600 miles, arrived at the stadium just in time for the opening ceremony. Hundreds of thousands of men and women stayed up all night waiting around the stadium to witness the unveiling of this unprecedented event. Approximately 6,000 athletes participated. The Greek team led the parade into the stadium, followed by the British team at the rear. British Prime Minister Attlee welcomed the athletes participating in the World Games.

The Olympic torch was lit on Mount Olympus in Greece and relayed by 1,717 runners from six countries, crossing the European continent and crossing the sea to London. There were originally 62 countries invited to the East, but Romania, Bulgaria, and Palestine did not send athletes, so only 59 countries actually participated. King George VI of England will open the Games. At that time, a 21-gun salute will be fired, and 5,000 athletes will march past the King. The opening program is scheduled as follows: (All times are Greenwich Mean Time, which is nine hours earlier than Shanghai time)

2:55 PM, the Chairman of the Organizing Committee, Birdwood, first addresses the athletes gathered in the arena, and then invites King George to declare the opening of the Games. 3:00 PM, the King declares the opening of the 14th World Games. 3:01 PM, the Games flag is slowly raised amidst fanfares. 3:02 PM, carrier pigeons are released. 3:05 PM, a 21-gun salute is fired. 3:07 PM, the relay runners carrying the torch arrive at the stadium and, after circling the stadium, light the Olympic torch.

### Chairman of the World Games Organizing Committee, Birdwood, Thanks Minister Zhu by Telegram

### Attlee Broadcasts a Welcome to the World Games Athletes

[United Press, London, 28th] British Prime Minister Attlee on the 28th welcomed "6,000 young men and women, the world's best athletes" to Britain and expressed hope that the Olympic competitions would help "resist the negative consequences of war." In a broadcast address on the BBC, Attlee said: "Today's sports are truly international, and the public's love of sports creates friendships between men and women separated by space and lacking a common language. The World Games transcend all boundaries... Unlike other struggles, the general result of sports competitions is to increase friendship between the victor and the vanquished. Today's world must seize every opportunity to widely disseminate friendship between men and women of different nationalities, thereby increasing international understanding." Attlee extended "our warmest welcome" on behalf of the British people to visitors from abroad. He also said that he hoped the climate would be favorable for the competitions, and that although Britain has a shortage of housing and food, it has boundless goodwill.

### Torch Arrives at Dover, Suddenly Extinguished by a Gale

[United Press, London, 28th] The Olympic torch, which was lit on July 17 at the ancient stadium in the Olympic Village in Greece, has arrived at Dover and will be relayed to London. This route will follow the muddy path that General Caesar's foreign troops marched on 2,000 years ago. When the World Games torch arrived at Dover, it was unexpectedly extinguished by a gale. Fortunately, the accompanying staff had a backup flame in the car, which was relit and continued its journey. The torch will run a little slower from the English Channel to Wimbledon, so that the torch will arrive on time at Wembley Stadium at 15:00 international time (midnight on the 30th Shanghai time) on the 30th when King George announces the opening of the 14th World Games.

### The United States Can Win the Overall Championship

Swimming is the most promising

[United Press, London, 28th] On the eve of the opening of the 14th World Games, coaches and athletes from various countries are predicting that the United States will win the overall championship. However, they also warned that Sweden also has a chance of pulling off an upset. It is generally recognized that the United States is certain to win the men's track and field, men's swimming, basketball, rowing, and weightlifting championships, and also has hope in boxing and the modern pentathlon. According to the scoring rules for the overall championship, it is necessary to have first place in ten events, second place in five events, third place in four events, fourth place in three events, fifth place in two events, and sixth place in one event. If the United States achieves these results, it can win the overall championship.

[United Press, London, 28th] The United States has far stronger hopes of winning swimming and diving events in the World Games opening on the 29th than the other 34 countries. Reese, the American 100-meter swimmer, is in excellent condition and has a chance of achieving the first astonishing result since Weissmuller broke the short-distance swimming record 20 years ago. The French athlete, Scheni, the world record holder, appears uninspired and timid during practice. Observers by the pool believe that Scheni has "stage fright." Fando from Philadelphia is also a "promising talent," and he is confident of winning the 200-meter backstroke. The American 800-meter relay team also had a "good performance" on the evening of the 27th. The American athlete, McLean, is only 17 years old, and his performance has improved during practice, with a time of 2 minutes and 11 seconds.

### Private School Tuition Fees for the Next Semester: Director Li of the Education Bureau Speaks, Emphasizing In-Kind Standards

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the tuition fee standards for private primary and secondary schools in the city for the upcoming semester, various rumors are circulating. Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau stated to reporters: "For the military celebration in Hangzhou and other places, tuition fees are standardized based on actual goods. To achieve a permanent solution, I personally advocate that tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools in our city should also be standardized based on actual goods." He believes that to run schools well, tuition fees should not be restricted. The financial affairs of private schools should be the responsibility of the board of directors. The reason why general private schools lack funding is because many board members hold only nominal positions. He considers it reasonable for the next semester's tuition standard to be equivalent to two *shi* of rice for senior and junior high schools, and one *shi* of rice for primary schools. If tuition is charged according to this standard, as long as the principal can absolutely ensure financial transparency and consider the welfare of teachers and staff, he believes that school expenses can be maintained. The Education Bureau has now instructed private primary and secondary schools to first discuss and formulate a standard, which will then be submitted to Mayor Wu for approval by the Education Bureau.

Jiang Jizhou's Statement

[Another Report] According to Jiang Jizhou, the person in charge of the Private Primary and Secondary School Federation in our city, who told reporters: "The standard for tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools for the next semester will need to be decided at a meeting in mid-August. Last semester, the highest tuition fee for senior high school was 4.8 million, the highest for junior high school was 3.84 million, and the highest for primary school was 2.4 million. At that time, the price of rice was 1.8 million per *shi*. The price of rice will also be considered when discussing tuition standards for this semester."

Suspension of Improvement Fees

[Our Newspaper's Report] Director Li of the City Education Bureau stated yesterday: "The City School Improvement Fee will not be collected next semester. However, the repair fee will still be collected as appropriate because the city government's subsidy is small." The Education Bureau previously planned to add 200 National Education classes next semester, which has been approved by the Senate, but it is still questionable whether the city government will allocate funds.

Director Li stated: "The Education Bureau is currently working hard to raise funds for scholarships for impoverished students in our city for the next semester. The fundraising method is to have individuals or organizations, based on their ability, designate a scholarship for one or more impoverished students. In the past, after the scholarship funds were raised, they were centrally allocated to schools by a unified review committee, and there was no relationship between the donors and the recipients. Last semester, approximately 10,000 students from primary, secondary, and higher education institutions received scholarships. In the future, it is planned to allow donors and recipients to have direct contact, with recipients personally collecting the funds from the donors. At the end of the semester, the school will send the scholarship recipients' transcripts to the donors for their review."

### Chongqing Municipality Private Secondary School Fee Standards Determined by the Senate

[Our Newspaper's Chongqing Dispatch, 29th] An important resolution passed by the Chongqing Senate on the 28th stated that fees for private secondary schools, including tuition and board, should not exceed six *dan* of rice, payable in two installments. In addition, each school should admit 20% of students free of charge, and the Education Bureau should use this as a performance evaluation criterion. Furthermore, the city government's budget for the second half of the year, 1.7 trillion, has been approved by the review committee.

### Looking at Mr. Feng Zikai from the Perspective of Dentures

— Xu Qinwen

Although we live on the shores of West Lake, I rarely see Mr. Feng Zikai because I am busy. Only when Zheng Dijun visits do I often hear some news about Mr. Feng from his mouth.

"Mr. Feng's teeth hurt again these past two days, so he hasn't been painting."

This is what I have heard many times. In the past, Mr. Feng adhered to the "three no's" principle: no teaching, no lecturing, no banquets. Of course, this was partly because he was busy painting, but not teaching was also half because he often had toothaches, making it inconvenient to talk much. Lecturing was the same because his teeth would hurt, making it inconvenient to talk much. And no banquets were because he was a vegetarian, not eating fish, shrimp, or meat, but also because his teeth were bad, making chewing inconvenient. So, the three no's principle was for only one reason: his bad teeth made chewing and talking difficult. This often made me sigh and think: If his teeth weren't bad, he could definitely produce more books that everyone loves. I remember Yuanqing saying to me that the good thing about Mr. Feng's teaching method was that it didn't make people feel like he was a teacher; it was like getting many good instructions in a conversation with relatives and friends. Such an excellent art educator, because of his bad teeth, actually adhered to the three no's principle, not teaching or lecturing; this is such a pity!

Last summer vacation, I had four molar roots extracted by Dr. Yi Zhaoxue, and my teeth on both sides were aligned, making chewing convenient and reducing illness. Dr. Yi's surgery is precise and the fees are low, and he is also amiable. I was very grateful and wrote "Supporting the Chin" to commemorate the event, and I asked Mr. Feng to write the last sentence "Never Forget After Every Meal" as a memento. My wife's painful tooth was caused by a rotated tooth root, which Dr. Yi extracted in two stages. Mr. Feng also knew about this. In conversation, Mr. Feng paid attention to our tooth extraction, and seemed quite interested. But I knew that for his teeth that were decayed, even if they were shaking very badly, he would not use artificial means to pull them out, always patiently waiting for them to fall out naturally. I understood the temperament of an artist who wouldn't shave his hair after his mother died, and thought it wasn't strange at all. But, relying on the warmth of friendship, I finally tried to persuade him to pull out the decayed tooth roots. We, as a couple, proved that Dr. Yi's tooth extraction did not feel painful, nor did it bleed much, and we talked about whether there was any danger.

"Extracting teeth," I said, "The only thing to fear is hemophilia; tooth extraction is originally not dangerous, but people with hemophilia bleed easily and it is difficult to stop, which is troublesome. So, as long as the first one extracted doesn't cause a problem, you don't have to be afraid of extracting any more later. The second is heart disease; because when injecting anesthesia, you need to add a bit of hemostatic medicine, and people with heart disease will get short of breath and can't stand it."

These words were heard from Dr. Yi; I was just turning on a broken record.

"I don't have heart disease, and I probably don't have hemophilia either." Mr. Feng said this, obviously already considering tooth extraction. When I told Dr. Yi about this, he considered it a difficult matter. The examination result was that seventeen tooth roots needed to be extracted before a full set of dentures could be fitted. I felt that this matter was very difficult, and I repeatedly indicated to Dr. Yi that, for the artistic Mr. Feng, he was used to letting things be natural and shouldn't be forced easily. However, unexpectedly, one day Dr. Yi came to see me, saying that Mr. Feng had already had tooth roots extracted twice, and the progress was good. He said that before Mr. Feng came to extract teeth, he first wrote me a letter, agreeing to come at a certain time on a certain day. When the day came for him to actually come and extract, he asked me, "Do you know why I had to write you a letter first?" I told him clearly that I didn't go out on Sunday afternoons, so he could come anytime; there was really no need to notify me in advance. But he explained that the purpose of writing this letter was not really to notify me, but to restrain himself. When he suddenly made the decision to extract the tooth roots, he was afraid that he would lack the courage to carry it out later, so he deliberately wrote this letter quickly, turning it into a kind of covenant, which he had to fulfill when the time came. Therefore, I knew that Mr. Feng was really a bit afraid of extracting teeth; but he values credibility and keeps his promises, so he finally came to extract according to the appointed time!

I was very touched; when I took the opportunity to visit Mr. Feng, he had already finished extracting the tooth roots. He said that sometimes he had them extracted for days in a row, and sometimes he had two or three extracted at once, shortening the scheduled time. "Only after pulling out the last tooth root did I feel a lightness in my shoulders!" Mr. Feng said triumphantly.

With no teeth in his mouth, I was afraid that eating would be inconvenient, so I inquired about how he was doing. He said, "Anyway, I don't eat hard things. I eat very quickly, and not much; this habit was developed when I was studying, in order to rush to play the piano."

This made me realize that the artistic profundity of Mr. Feng Zikai, who has distinctive characteristics in painting, music, literature, and calligraphy, is not accidental. Making a decision and seriously studying it is what allows one to succeed. Extracting seventeen tooth roots is just the most recent example. At first, I thought it would be difficult, which was not entirely an overestimation, but I thought that Mr. Feng had an artistic nature and loved to let things be natural, and I didn't know that he was also very capable of breaking free from nature and striving for progress.

Mr. Feng is also so frank; in his writing about extracting teeth, he always added "Brother" or "Mr." and other titles under my name; in the section where he wrote his impressions, he only wrote "Xu Qinwen." If he also added a title, that would be inconsistent with human nature; when thinking to himself, he wouldn't add a title to someone. But general hypocritical records would add many embellishments. He sent Dr. Yi a couplet, the first line "Skill Advances to the Divine," the second line "Man's Creation Surpasses Heaven's." When he had just had his dentures fitted, he said to me, "The first line is really right; Dr. Yi's skills are indeed good. After extracting the tooth roots, I only feel that the previous terror was completely unnecessary. But the second line is still a problem; after all, the fake ones are not as convenient as my own real teeth." If it's inconvenient for a long time, that's also a flaw in the technique. I thought he was just saying this to me; a few days later, I ran into Dr. Yi and mentioned this meaning, which shows that he had already expressed it to him as well. But after two or three months, the gums were firm, and after a series of adjustment procedures, he also got used to it. Mr. Feng then indicated to me that the second line was also correct. Soon, I heard the same meaning from Dr. Yi's mouth as well. — He expresses things as he feels them; being truthful to things and principles is the true nature of an artist. From extracting teeth, I felt more and more that Mr. Feng was able to preserve his true self and be worthy of respect.

### Heaven and Hell

— Wu Yong

When relatives and friends meet today, 99 percent always start by complaining to each other and end by sighing in mutual sympathy. I, however, think that this may not be a bad phenomenon.

In fact, there are naturally also people who express their joy and excitement about the current situation. These belong to the 1 percent minority. These people are either watching the fire from the other side of the river, or fishing in troubled waters, or adding fuel to the fire; in short, they are people in the clouds. In addition, there are some who are originally people on the ground, but only want to get in touch with people in the clouds, so their words and expressions are full of praise for the current situation. These people are big children who have not been weaned, and cannot survive independently without a wet nurse until death. If the wet nurse says that the weather is a bit cold today, he will say: "It's simply like the North Pole." If someone proposes to issue million-yuan bills, he will immediately agree to issue ten million or one hundred million yuan bills. These people are nothing more than a bunch of "street performers" at heart, and always take "If I don't stay here, I'll find somewhere else" as their only creed for dealing with the world. These people's sense of right and wrong has long been extinguished, and their conscience has long been lost. They only see "steering according to the wind" as their ability. Listening to their words, at first glance, it seems to be beneficial to the authorities, but in fact, as soon as the wet nurse is used up, there will immediately be another kind of argument. The most misleading and the most useless are these people. We really cannot place any hope on these kinds of optimistic people in the clouds, or the quasi-cloud people who echo them.

On the contrary, those who complain are actually the ones who most desire the current situation to improve, that is, the ones who place the most hope in the government. Their angry words are enough to show their fervent expectations for the government.

However, "disappointment" often easily turns into "despair," leading to negativity and decadence. This is inevitably overcorrecting, just like forming two extremes with the people in the clouds, one in heaven and one in hell, disconnected from the world of people in the middle. We must know that the Earth has been condensed for about 2 billion years, and the history of human civilization on Earth is only 4,000 years at most. We must know that it has not yet been 2,400 years since mankind had Sakyamuni; it has not yet been 2,499 years since mankind had Confucius; it has not yet been 1,948 years since mankind had Jesus. Columbus' discovery of the New World was only a little more than 400 years ago; Copernicus first created the "heliocentric theory" in 1543, and Bruno and Galileo were only burned alive and sentenced to imprisonment for deeply believing in this theory. This seems ridiculous to today's people, but it was really only a little more than 400 years ago. Watt's invention of the steam engine, Hargreaves' invention of the spinning machine, Edison's invention of the electric light, and Marconi's invention of the wireless telegraph were all things that happened less than 200 years ago. In other words, these new things and new enjoyments were not known by my great-grandparents.

Generally speaking, the entire human race is really very intelligent and has a bright future. We must not forget that today's humans are still only half-human, half-animal. It is quite difficult to have achieved so much today. Today's chaos, today's war, when viewed from a distance, are nothing more than a small twist in the midst of a great evolutionary trend. Today's people's dissatisfaction with everything around them is precisely a sign that our ideal standards are rising. Therefore, although we are disappointed, we do not need to despair. We must know that we are not in heaven, nor are we in hell, but in the world of people.

### Gambling

— Yi Jun

Smoking, drinking, prostitution, and gambling are either bad habits or improper entertainment. Fortunately, I am not interested in any of these four. The one I am comparatively a little interested in, the one I occasionally play a bit to have fun, is gambling, but my aversion to gambling even surpasses my aversion to prostitution.

Smoking can refresh the mind; drinking can forget worries; prostitution can release desires; what about gambling? I think it has a hundred harms and not a single benefit. Reasons:

First, gambling for money is ill-intentioned. A person who participates in gambling always wants to win other people's money, and will never try to lose. When gambling becomes intense, regardless of whether others are bankrupt, their families are broken, or their families are ruined, they will never give up the opportunity to win money. How is this different from the robber behavior of murdering and arson?

Second, gambling mostly leads to losing money. For ordinary gambling, the number of wins and losses depends on skill, but mainly on luck. Luck cannot be good every time, but it is very likely to be bad every time. Bad luck makes you lose; good luck wins, but the next time you encounter bad luck, you often lose not only what you won, but also your capital. People who lose money are always hot-tempered. The more they lose, the more fierce they become. The more fierce they become, the more they lose. When they are extremely angry, they often do not hesitate to stake everything on one throw, and end up bankrupt.

Third, the amount of effort, damage to health, and waste of time involved in gambling are simply unparalleled. Everyone's nerves are extremely tense every minute and every second, harboring great hope and fear before revealing the cards, and after revealing the cards, except for the winner, everyone else is full of disappointment and regret. In such a tense scene, one game follows another. When it gets dark, the electric lights are turned on. When the electric lights are turned off, candles are lit. The dark night passes, but they don't stop at dawn. The loss of time, energy, and health is unparalleled.

Fourth, some people use gambling as a means of socializing, a way to connect emotionally. But according to my observation, it is often counterproductive. A person who is usually generous often becomes extremely stingy on the gambling table, fighting for every penny. I have often seen even very good friends argue until their faces are red for the sake of a single pancake on the gambling table, sometimes "break up unhappily" for the sake of a single sentence, and sometimes stage a "full-scale martial arts fight" for a sesame-sized matter. There are endless such situations.

The disadvantages of gambling are certainly not limited to this, but these four major crimes alone are enough for me to shout, "Gambling is the source of all evils!"

### Jiangxi Siamese Twins: An Old Story

— You Mo-jun

On July 20th, this newspaper's fifth page featured a Nanchang news dispatch stating that a pair of Siamese twins from Jiangxi, "Liu Shengjie and Liu Shengdi," were currently in Nanchang, exhibiting themselves for a ticket revenue of 150,000 yuan, and were planning to go to Shanghai to satisfy the viewing of the Shanghainese people. The "Ancient and Modern Wonders" column of the same newspaper also included a special illustration. On July 23rd, the fifth page of this newspaper again carried a news dispatch stating that the "Siamese twins" were going to Xun on the 22nd, to tour and exhibit in the Beijing-Shanghai area. During this hot summer, it is expected that this pair of "Siamese twins" will cause a sensation in Shanghai and become a topic of conversation.

According to records, this pair of "Siamese twins" has now come to Shanghai for the second time. Their first visit to Shanghai was in 1892, which was the 18th year of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, the Ren Chen year. This is recorded in Ye Juchang's "Notes from the Yandu Cottage," volume 6, entry for the 18th day of the fourth lunar month. The record states: "On the 18th, I took my child to see the strange children. The two children were born without navels. Instead, there was flesh connecting them at the navel, shaped like a 'yong' (甬), about three inches long, with exposed blue veins, and the skin color like a fleshy tumor. It is said that they were from Jiangxi. Note: 'yong' refers to the bell handle, see the Rites of Zhou." The newspaper's news dispatch also states: "The only connection between them is a fist-sized fleshy mass in the hypochondrium, which can sometimes stretch to about an inch, but this is not a frequent occurrence." By comparing Ye's record with the news dispatch, it is clear that the "Siamese twins" who have come to Shanghai now are undoubtedly the "strange children" seen by Ye Gong. The slight differences are that one account says the fleshy tumor grew at the navel, while the other says the fleshy mass grew in the hypochondrium. One says it was about three inches long, while the other says it could only stretch to about an inch, and even that was not a frequent occurrence. However, these are only minor discrepancies. As for the difference in the degree of stretching, it should have decreased with age, because when Ye Gong saw this pair of Siamese twins, they were only five years old.

The diary also records their actions: "When one drinks, both get drunk; when one eats, both cannot be fully satisfied; when one sits, both sit together; when one sleeps, both sleep together. When the two do something together, one uses the right hand and the other uses the left hand, their fingers and arms connected without any gap." This is corroborated by the news dispatch: "In terms of eating and drinking, if one drinks wine, the other will also get drunk... However, if one eats, they cannot both be full at the same time, and the way each person holds the chopsticks is also different. One uses the natural right hand, while the one on the left uses the left hand instead. Each uses the left or right hand to hold the bowl," which is also in complete agreement. This proves that the "strange children" recorded by Ye are the "Siamese twins" who have come to Shanghai now.

The public called them "strange children," saying, "The grandmother and father brought them... Their appearance is also handsome and of equal height." According to the news dispatch, this pair of strange children is now sixty-two years old. This time they revisit Shanghai, like Liu Lang returning after a long absence, they must be overwhelmed with feelings about the past and present!

### Idle Thoughts on a Rat Peeking into the Pavilion

— Yu Shou

Beijing's Palace Architecture

If Beijing's palace architecture were to be described in detail, countless pages would be insufficient. In fact, within the Forbidden City, the residences of emperors and concubines are mostly large, plain houses, lacking any charm. Their beauty lies in the Three Seas, which were formerly the royal gardens. Among the Three Seas, Zhonghai is the most outstanding. The Listening to the Wild Geese Tower and the Washing Water Sounds pavilion are both masterpieces of their time.

During the Manchu Qing Dynasty, all architectural designs (including palaces and mausoleums) were handled by the "Construction Office" of the Imperial Household Department. These people were not architectural experts, but they each had secret books to rely on. They could accurately calculate the style of the project and the required materials. The arithmetic they used did not involve square roots or geometry, only the abacus. Why was this so? It is impossible to find out. The palace models currently displayed in the Meridian Gate Museum in Beijing are mostly old collections of the Construction Office, not all the work of the "Yangshi Lei" family. (The Construction Office was run by four major families, one of which was the father of the former court actor Wang Youchen.) As for the aforementioned secret books, some have already been taken to Japan, and only a few remaining copies are stored in the Summer Palace.

During the Beiyang government era, Zhu Guixin (Qiqian), although a corrupt official, was quite knowledgeable about ceremonial systems and cultural relics. The "Chinese Architectural Society" he founded collected a large number of drawings and models. After Guixin's death, who took over the possession of these materials is not known in detail, but it is likely that many have been scattered among the bookstores in Liulichang.

The beauty of Beijing's palace architecture is best appreciated from a high vantage point. The Wanchun Pavilion on Coal Hill and the summit of Jade Island in Beihai are both ideal locations. Looking down on the entire Forbidden City, the colors of azure and saffron are intertwined, inspiring a feeling of devout religious sentiment.
