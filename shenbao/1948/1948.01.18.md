### Bei Zuyi and Others Arrive in Washington, D.C. To Meet with Marshall Regarding Aid to China Plan; Loan Amount Rumored to be Over 500 Million

(United Press Washington, D.C., 16th) The Chinese technical delegation, including Bei Zuyi and two others, arrived here on the 16th to assist the U.S. government in finalizing a new aid plan for China. Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Gu Weijun and Director of the China Desk at the State Department, Mr. Lin Bide, greeted them at the airport. The other two members of the delegation were already at Mr. Lin's residence. Secretary of State Marshall has assured the delegation that he will meet with them to discuss the current economic situation in China and the various measures taken by the Chinese government. At the same time, officials stated that the new aid to China bill could be submitted to Congress for discussion before the end of the month. Rumors that the government would not submit the bill until Congress clarified its position on the aid to Europe plan were unfounded.

(United Press Washington, D.C., 16th) Bei Zuyi stated that he did not wish to elaborate on his trip to the United States to the press. The delegation will set up an office in the Shoreham Hotel. (United Press Washington, D.C., 16th) The amount of U.S. aid to China has not yet been announced. Informed sources say that the total amount of aid to China being considered by the State Department is over 500 million dollars, but it will "undoubtedly" be revised before being submitted to Congress.

(Central News Agency New York, 16th, United Press) A former U.S. diplomat in China, now a well-known exporter to China, Mr. Hunter, recently called for a prompt loan of 600 million dollars to China for its industrialization. He said that this aid should be part of a comprehensive aid plan that includes military aid to China and assistance with its currency reform. The total cost would be no more than 1.5 billion, and a 600 million dollar loan to China over two years could help China overcome its current crisis. He outlined his plan in six major areas: Restore the Canton-Hankow Railway, restore factories in South China, modernize irrigation methods in South China and provide modern equipment, improve the chemical fertilizer program, provide ships to restore China's inland river and coastal shipping, and wool loans and a 3 million dollar tobacco loan. Mr. Hunter also said that the United States need not wait for Congressional action and could provide aid to China through the U.S. War Assets Administration in accordance with the law. China's application for a 22.2 million dollar line of credit to purchase surplus materials from the War Assets Administration has not yet been implemented, which he found puzzling. He also said that China needs assistance in its budget because it is plagued by war, and it is difficult for the United States to balance its budget under such circumstances, let alone demand it of China. As for the Communist Party, Mr. Hunter said that President Chiang did not eliminate the Communist Party when he could have. Mr. Hunter made a speech to more than 200 members of the Shanghai Luncheon Club, and this article is only a part of its content.

### U.S. to Sell Oil This Spring; We Are Allocated 600,000 Barrels; U.S. Acknowledges Our Right to Dispose of Surplus Iron Sand from Sales

(United Press Washington, D.C., 16th) In the quota table for petroleum products for the first quarter of 1948 announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce on the 16th, China was allocated 60,000 barrels of aviation gasoline, 350,000 barrels of other gasoline, 110,000 barrels of kerosene, and 100,000 barrels of diesel and residue-free diesel. The total export quota is 14.47 million barrels, which is allocated to each country by the International Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Philippines was allocated 20,000 barrels of gasoline, 130,000 barrels of other types of oil, 70,000 barrels of kerosene, and 160,000 barrels of diesel and residue-free diesel. Japan and the Ryukyu Islands were not allocated aviation gasoline, but received 460,000 barrels of other types of gasoline, 50,000 barrels of kerosene, and 375,000 barrels of diesel.

(United Press Washington, D.C., 16th) State Department officials said that they have learned that China's resale of iron sand from surplus U.S. military materials obtained from Pacific islands to Bethlehem Steel is legal. It is said that each country can choose its own way to dispose of these materials. Because China lacks steel mills to consume large amounts of iron sand, China's sale of iron sand is logical. They pointed out that the intermediary must bear the transportation costs and responsibility, and therefore they should be entitled to a profit.

The White House rescinded the order last fall prohibiting China and other countries from reselling goods in contracts to the United States because the United States needed them urgently and was willing to buy them back.

### Lattimore and Lin Yutang Debate Aid to China Issue

(U.S. Information Service, Erie, Pennsylvania, 16th) Far East experts Owen Lattimore and Dr. Lin Yutang debated the U.S. aid to China issue at a Foreign Policy Association meeting here on January 10. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Lattimore believes that military equipment shipped to the Chinese government will be lost or fall into "other hands." He also opposes financial aid, arguing that Chinese officials have large private deposits in American banks.

Professor Lin Yutang said, "Every U.S. dollar used by the United States to support the Chinese government can accomplish a great benefit. The Chinese government is a government recognized by all the great powers, including the Soviet Union. Supporting this government is a matter of common sense and sound strategic guidance. U.S. aid to China is most effective when it comes in the form of technical assistance. The expenditure of aid should be satisfactory to both Chinese and American authorities. This kind of aid is as decisive in Asia as the Marshall Plan can be in Europe."

Lattimore said, "To think of supporting the current Chinese government with cannons or money as a means of containing the Soviet Union is not only ineffective but also harmful. Today in China, a very simple and powerful nationalism is more important than ideology. Since the Chinese Revolution of 1911, the Chinese people have always felt that foreign forces and ideas are the worst threat to China's independence."

### Application of Japanese Reparations Machines; Factories Relocating Inland Request Preferential Treatment

[Reported by This City] Among the materials of Japan's reparations to our country, more than 9,000 units of the first batch of machine tools to be dismantled and relocated will be allocated to various state-owned enterprises, and the remaining quarter, about 2,000 units, will be sold to private enterprises. The "Shanghai Office of the United Association of Factories Relocating to Sichuan and Guangxi" previously nominated representatives Hu Juewen, Yan Yaoqiu, and Hu Yuezhong to make suggestions to the central government, requesting that the more than 2,000 units of reparations machines be first used to compensate for the losses of factories relocating inland, and the surplus be rented or purchased by factories relocating inland. The association also hosted a press conference at the Xingwuxu restaurant on the 4th floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road at 4 p.m. on the 17th to report on the suggestions made to the central government and to state the current situation. It is said that "factories relocating inland participated in the War of Resistance, and have contributed to the country. After the victory, they are in a difficult situation, and they have the right to request prior compensation for the reparations materials that are dismantled and relocated in advance. After the amount of reparations at the peace conference is determined in the future, they will be cleared. When the representatives made suggestions to the central government this time, the heads of the relevant ministries and commissions expressed deep sympathy, but the distance from the factories relocating inland is still far. It is hoped that the public opinion will uphold justice and call on the government to accept the objective requirements of the factories relocating inland."

The declaration puts forward the so-called error of the law not being retroactive, the legality of the political party nominating party member candidates, the nomination of the Xiaoshu should be limited to social elites, and the purpose of the formal and candidate candidates determined by the central government is for competition between political parties, not for competition between formal and candidate candidates. Party discipline and the leader's will are not allowed to be destroyed, and public opinion is not allowed to be borrowed. If the formal candidate receives fewer votes, it is not their fault, so the central government should not accommodate the few who violate the order and are elected. It is hoped that the central government will maintain its original decision, thoroughly implement the President's will, so as to clarify right and wrong, distinguish good from evil, and maintain the dignity of party discipline, national law, and the prestige of the central government.

### The North China剿總 (Suppression General Headquarters) Releases the Account of Army Commander Lu Ying's Suicide

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th Dispatch] The North China Bandit Suppression General Headquarters released the account of the suicide of the 35th Army Commander, Lu Yingchen, stating: The Laishui Campaign concluded at noon on the 13th. In this battle, Li Mingding, commander of the 32nd Division of the 35th Army, led two regiments to reinforce friendly forces, engaging in repeated assaults against bandits twenty times the size of the National Army. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the battle never ceased for a single minute, ultimately achieving brilliant results, killing or wounding over ten thousand communist bandits, capturing over two hundred, and seizing one thousand firearms. However, Division Commander Li Mingding unfortunately died in action at the forefront, resulting in over five hundred officer and soldier casualties, over one thousand wounded, and the loss of four mountain guns, several mortars, over ten heavy machine guns, and over five hundred rifles due to the deaths and injuries of officers and soldiers, preventing their retrieval.

However, the Shameen incident occurred on the afternoon of the 16th, and the British ambassador stated that he reserved certain rights, suspending the negotiations. On the 17th, both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the British Embassy remained silent. It is understood that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs must fully understand all the facts before deciding on a countermeasure to the Shameen incident.

### Weekly Forum - On the Kowloon Walled City Incident

— Zhou Youcun

1.  The Expansion of the Kowloon Walled City Incident.

The British flag in Burma was officially lowered on the 4th of this month, demonstrating that Britain's Far East policy after the war has gradually become more reasonable, which is gratifying. Unexpectedly, on the 5th, the Hong Kong and Kowloon police, under the command of the British government, armedly entered the Kowloon Walled City, forcibly demolishing the homes of Chinese residents and arresting Zhu Pei, the chairman of the Kowloon Walled City Residents Association, and Liu Yifu, the residents' representative. Although the Chinese government expressed its hope that this issue could be resolved through legal channels, the Hong Kong authorities insisted on their own way and brazenly dispatched fully armed British police on the morning of the 12th, opening fire on our unarmed residents and throwing tear gas, injuring eight people. The Kowloon Walled City incident has thus expanded, making it impossible for any Chinese person to remain silent.

The Kowloon Walled City incident can simply be said to be the first humiliation encountered since China abolished unequal treaties! We are definitely not emotionally driven and deliberately exaggerating to harm the Sino-British friendship and diplomatic relations that have been constantly improving since the Second World War. However, we cannot help but express great indignation at the Hong Kong government's illegal behavior. At the same time, we also feel very sorry for the Hong Kong government's unintelligent, inhumane behavior that hinders the progress of Sino-British relations!

Although the authorities of the Hong Kong government are accustomed to the imperialist approach to treating colonies, they should also know that the Chinese and British nations fought side by side in the Second World War, jointly resisting Japanese aggression. Moreover, seeing China's emphasis on morality and love of peace, Britain took the lead in abolishing the unequal treaties between China and Britain on January 11, 1943. Subsequently, the exchange of envoys between the two countries further showed the gradual progress of their friendly relations. Last year, the British Parliamentary Delegation to China also saw how China was gaining Britain's true friendship in order to strengthen trade between them and prevent British commerce from withdrawing from the Far East market. Unfortunately, the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue has become a major obstacle to the enhancement of Sino-British diplomatic relations.

At a time when China and Britain are making every effort to promote diplomatic relations, the Hong Kong government is only using the "reason" that the residents of Kowloon Walled City are filthy, unhygienic, and if disease occurs, it will spread to residents outside the city; that after the demolition of the houses in Kowloon Walled City, a park will be built, and the construction of the park will also be very beneficial to the health of the original Chinese residents; that according to international law, the government can advise residents to pay attention to hygiene, and then use force to demolish the homes of Chinese residents, causing them injury and loss. This is truly a miracle in the history of international relations. We must not turn a blind eye to this new pain after the old wounds have not yet healed.

2.  To Whom Does the Sovereignty of Kowloon Walled City Belong?

The residents of a city should be hygienic, but hygiene is one issue, and invading a friendly country is another issue, and there must be a distinction between the two. According to the Sino-British treaty concluded in 1860, China only allowed the lease of Kowloon as a barrier to Hong Kong. The old site of Kowloon Walled City and Longjin Datong are still Chinese territory, and all administrative power belongs to China and is governed by Baoan County of Guangdong Province.

In order to fully understand whether the sovereignty of Kowloon belongs to China or Britain, let us further trace some of the past history.

After Britain entered China through the door of the Opium War, the Treaty of Nanjing on August 29, 1842, ceded Hong Kong to the British Empire. Britain has always adopted a two-pronged system for occupied areas. In order to defend Hong Kong, it attempted to occupy a place on the opposite bank of the Chinese mainland, separated only by a strip of water. The Kowloon Peninsula on the north shore of Hong Kong at that time became the second target. In the Treaty of Beijing on September 11, 1860, she again ceded 1,700 square miles of Kowloon from China. On June 9, 1898 (that is, the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu), China and Britain signed the "Convention Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory," which made the entire Kowloon Peninsula leased by Britain for ninety-nine years. The islands north of 22 degrees 9 minutes north latitude and east of 113 degrees 52 minutes to 114 degrees 30 minutes east longitude, as well as Dapeng Bay, Shenzhen Bay, and the surrounding waters of Hong Kong, were all included. The treaty stipulated the following for the Kowloon Walled City issue, which has become a problem today: "All Chinese officials stationed in Kowloon City may continue to perform their duties in the city, provided that they do not interfere with the military preparations for the defense of Hong Kong. The rest of the newly leased land shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the British. The land route from Kowloon to Xin'an (that is, Shian) shall be open to Chinese officials and civilians as usual, and the old pier area near Kowloon City shall be reserved to allow Chinese soldiers, merchants, and boats to come and go and dock at will, and also to allow officials in the city to walk at will," and it was also stated: "It is agreed that within the extended boundaries, residents shall not be forced to move." This is tantamount to stating that Britain recognized that the sovereignty of Kowloon Walled City completely belonged to China; otherwise, Chinese officials would not be able to perform their duties in the city, and Chinese military and merchant ships would not be able to dock at will. This also explains that the Hong Kong police's demolition of Chinese residents' houses in Kowloon is illegal and violates the treaty. Because it is stipulated that "residents shall not be forced to move out," but now the houses of residents are demolished, making them homeless, then it is even more inexplicable!

3.  Britain Cannot Shake China's Existing Treaty Rights in Kowloon Walled City.

Although the British officially took over the extended boundary on April 17, 1899, the villagers of Kam Tin closed the village gate to resist, causing the British to accuse Chinese officials of failing to assist effectively, and on May 16, all Chinese officials in Kowloon were expelled, making it impossible for the Chinese government to actually exercise sovereignty in Kowloon ever since. However, this cannot shake China's existing treaty rights.

When the Chinese officials were expelled from Kowloon Walled City, there were only more than 50 households and about 1,000 residents, both men and women. The British never expressed anything about this, which was completely different from the situation in the other New Territories. This shows that the British did not dare to rashly recognize their sovereignty there. However, gradually, the Hong Kong government began to pay attention to this, and in June 1933, on the pretext that the city was full of slums, the place was unclean, and it was harmful to hygiene, it notified the residents of the city to move to Gou Ling, near the airport, by compensating for the price of the property. The residents of the city refused to accept this illegal request, so they did not comply. The Hong Kong government brought up the old case again the following year, and eventually, because the residents were unwilling to move, they elected representatives to petition the Chinese government, and Gan Jiehou, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, protested to the Hong Kong government according to the treaty, and the matter was eventually dropped. In 1940, the Hong Kong government, for the third time, used the excuse that the owner of the property demanded strict enforcement and demolished the houses of the residents in the city. At that time, China was engaged in the war against aggression and had no time to take care of it or seriously protest to the British government, so the Hong Kong government secretly achieved its task. But soon the residents built wooden houses again, and the Hong Kong government had no way to destroy the indomitable national spirit of the Chinese people.

Unexpectedly, after Britain agreed to abolish extraterritoriality in China, return concessions, and revise treaties based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, the imperialist posture of the British colonial government remained unchanged. It issued an eviction order on November 27 last year, wanting to evacuate about 2,000 Chinese residents of Kowloon Walled City from their existing wooden houses, and set a deadline of December 10. At that time, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said: "If they do not evacuate, the Hong Kong government will order them to move quickly." The representatives of the Kowloon Residents Association stated at a press conference on December 6 that they resolutely refused to withdraw from the area, and said: "Even if it means risking bloodshed, we will not hesitate." Guo Dehua, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, anticipated the possible development of this issue and negotiated with the Hong Kong government, but to no avail, so he had to fly to Beijing to ask for instructions. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was busy with other matters at that time and did not take active action on this, and the Hong Kong government thought that there was another opportunity to take advantage of, so it ignored the law and facts and finally caused an unfortunate bloody tragedy.

4.  Kowloon Walled City Should Be Returned to China Soon!

After the Hong Kong police entered Kowloon Walled City on January 12 and injured the residents, the Chinese government received the news, and Foreign Minister Wang summoned British Ambassador Stevenson to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the same day, requesting the London government to immediately instruct the Governor of Hong Kong to terminate all negotiations and actions in Kowloon Walled City during this negotiation period, and not to send police into the city again. Regarding the Chinese government's written requests on the 8th concerning the Hong Kong government's forcible demolition of residents' houses in Kowloon Walled City, the British government must attach importance to the friendly relations between the two countries and their people, and stop continuing to take these measures in Hong Kong. Foreign Minister Wang also asked him to urge the British side to accept them. However, on the 13th, Kowloon Walled City was still guarded by armed police, monitoring the residents and not allowing them to rebuild. Britain's unbridled and wanton actions in China's sovereign territory are a shameful act of aggression.

The British government should know that the ugly faces of the aggressors of any imperialist era can no longer exist today, and British gentlemen with political vision, especially the leaders of the Labour Party, must have a correct understanding of the success or failure of the British Empire's colonial policy and how it is reacting. If they continue to use the failed methods of dealing with colonies to deal with China, a true friendly country, it is obviously too inappropriate to think about the future of the British Empire.

What Britain should especially know is that since the unequal treaties between China and Britain have been abolished, in principle, both Kowloon and Hong Kong should be returned to China. Because according to the promises of the United States and Britain and the Atlantic Charter, China has recovered Lushun, Datong, and Taiwan, and France has also returned Guangzhou Bay. Therefore, the return of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Macau, and other places should also be no exception. The leased area of Kowloon should be returned first to comply with the spirit of the Atlantic Charter.

Since the Labour Party came to power in Britain, it has changed its previous imperialist policy. It has successively abandoned its rule over its colonies such as India and Burma and allowed them to become independent. Moreover, after this war, Britain's future strategic layout has greatly changed. Under the threat of the atomic bomb, the tiny Hong Kong and Kowloon have lost their military importance. However, if Britain continues to occupy them, it means that world politics has not yet been incorporated into the right path.

But we must know that today is neither the Opium War period nor the Boxer Rebellion period. Friendly countries that interact with China today must no longer treat China with the hideous faces of imperialism. The Chinese people today will no longer shut themselves off or even blindly exclude foreigners as they did in the past. We hope that the Hong Kong government will not continue its unwise actions and damage Sino-British diplomatic relations; at the same time, we also hope that the Chinese people will use their rationality to urge the government to change its weak attitude, argue on the basis of reason, but must not rely on the violence of the mob to take excessive actions, such as burning down the British Consulate in Guangzhou on the 16th, to increase the estrangement between China and Britain. Otherwise, not only Sino-British diplomatic relations but the entire world will be greatly affected.

### Declaration by University Presidents in Guangzhou: The Student Movement to Protect Rights Deserves Sympathy, Rioters Taking the Opportunity to Cause Trouble Should Be Severely Punished

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th] Regarding the unfortunate Shameen incident, the presidents of various universities and colleges in Guangzhou issued a joint declaration on the 17th as follows: "The motivation of the students from various schools participating in the citywide demonstration parade to protest the forcible demolition of residents' homes in Kowloon Walled City is purely patriotic and enthusiastic. As teachers, we have always taught people to love the country, so we have no objection, but we have repeatedly instructed them beforehand to maintain good civil order. However, after the parade disbanded, some rioters took the opportunity to join in arson and burn down the British Consulate, which made us sigh with regret! Patriotic parades are one thing, and arson and sabotage are another. The two cannot be confused. The former should be given sympathy, and the latter should be punished by law, and there should be absolutely no leniency. In order to express our attitude from the perspective of those of us in the school, we jointly advocate that the perpetrators of this evil act be severely punished according to the law in order to maintain discipline. We hereby declare this, hoping that all sectors at home and abroad will understand. Wang Xinggong, President of National Sun Yat-sen University, Li Yinglin, President of Lingnan University, Wu Dingxin, President of National University, Wang Zhiyuan, President of Guangzhou University, Huang Linshu, President of Wanghai University, He Qizhan, Dean of Provincial College of Arts and Sciences, Zhang Liangxiu, Dean of Provincial College of Law, Ding [illegible], President of Provincial [illegible] Vocational School, Xu [illegible] Hui, President of Provincial Physical Education Vocational School, Wu Yong, Dean of Chinese Culture College, Lu Gandong, Dean of Guangzhou Law School."

### Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and Others Talk About the Shameen Case: Demolition of Houses and Disturbances Are Both Regrettable

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding his views on the Kowloon Walled City issue, Vice President Sun Ke stated that he believes that a solution can be obtained through diplomatic channels. However, the Guangzhou incident was an unnecessary complication and is extremely regrettable. Hong Lanyou, secretary of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, stated: The student movement currently caused by the Kowloon Walled City issue cannot be said to be inappropriate, but it must not lead to unexpected xenophobic changes.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang Central Committee, told reporters: "The burning of the British Consulate in Shameen, Guangzhou, and the forced demolition of residents' homes in Kowloon Walled City, resulting in injuries from the Hong Kong police, are both unfortunate events. The Hong Kong government used the excuse of public health and fire hazards, and even failed to make proper arrangements in advance, and hastily forced residents to demolish their houses and relocate, which is deeply regrettable. As for the demonstration parade by the people of Guangzhou, it is also regrettable that the patriotic action turned into an excessive behavior due to the infiltration of rioters."

### British Colonial Office Statement Defends Kowloon Walled City Case

[Reuters, London, 17th] The British Colonial Office issued a statement on the 17th to clarify the Kowloon Walled City eviction case. According to the statement, the Hong Kong authorities ordered the residents of Kowloon Walled City to move because they believed that the area posed public dangers in terms of fire and hygiene, and that adequate warnings had been given to the local residents before the eviction order was carried out, and that places to live had been suggested to the residents.

[United Press, Peiping, 17th] Former British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, told Chinese and foreign reporters on the 17th that he considered the Kowloon Walled City incident a "trivial matter," but the way it developed was regrettable. He believed that the reports circulating outside must have been "exaggerated."

[Our Newspaper Report] The head of the British Information Office, Mike Fernly, met with reporters yesterday and stated: "The British expatriates in this city have all expressed shock at the Shameen incident. However, they will not express their opinions until the instigators are identified. The act of burning down the consulate is very serious in nature. It is extremely regrettable that this unfortunate incident occurred between friendly nations of China and Britain." The reporter informed him that the demolition of houses in Kowloon was the main cause of the Shameen incident, and that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a statement regretting that the British government had not intervened. Mike replied: "The London government believes that the demolition of houses in Kowloon is within the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong government. Since the Chinese government has not raised this issue with the British government, the London government will naturally not intervene. The reporter further inquired whether Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's visit to the East was to mediate the matter. Mike believed that this was only speculation from the outside world. However, Sir Kerr is a capable diplomat and has always sympathized with China. He may automatically mediate the matter. However, his visit to China this time is purely for private travel and he has no representative status. Therefore, he can only contribute his opinions in talks with Chinese government personnel. Sir Kerr has already met with President Chiang and visited President Zhang. The Kowloon Walled City issue must have been mentioned in the talks. All negotiations are currently being conducted in Nanjing. Your country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed its willingness to reach a friendly agreement, which is expected to be resolved soon." When the reporter visited, the editor of the North China Daily News was also present. They were all extremely concerned about the student parade in this city. As a result, British institutions on the Bund shortened their office hours yesterday.

### A Batch of British Expatriates Arrive in Hong Kong

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th] The Hong Kong Airways plane sent by the Hong Kong government to evacuate women and children in Guangzhou landed at Baiyun Airport at 7:00 a.m. on the 17th. Eighteen British expatriates, including eleven women, six children, and one man, were escorted to the airport by Police Chief Li [illegible] Han, Deng Sixiao, head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Municipal Government, and Secretary Yang Zhao[illegible]. British Consul-General Hartwood also accompanied them to the airport to see them off. The plane took off and flew to Hong Kong. After the British women and children took off, Chief Li and others escorted the British Consul-General back to Shameen.

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] It is reported that the Hong Kong side may send the warship "Herald" to Guangzhou on the 18th for the purpose of evacuating British expatriates in case of emergency.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 17th] Mayor Ouyang Ju stated today that he is willing to compensate the British side for the loss of property destroyed in the fire.

### Hong Kong Dollar Devalues, Prices Rise

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 17th] After the British Consulate in Shameen, Guangzhou, was burned down, the leaders of Guangdong and Guangzhou expressed regret over the incident. The fire destroyed a total of four British institutions: the British Consulate, Swire & Maclaine, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and Jardine Matheson. The extent of the damage is still under investigation. In addition, Mr. Hutter, manager of Swire & Maclaine, Mr. Backhouse, deputy manager, and a British professor from Sun Yat-sen University were slightly injured. Reports that the British Consul had gone missing are inaccurate. Transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong by road and water is still operating as usual, and flights by Hong Kong-Guangzhou Airways officially resumed on the 17th. There is no sense of crisis rumored since the incident. The British side has denied sending warships to Guangzhou. However, the devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar and the sharp rise in prices in Hong Kong are facts. The Guangzhou Support Association for the Kowloon Walled City Incident is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on the 18th and will make an important decision. [Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th] Committee Member Xiao Ciyin, representing the Guangdong Provincial Government to visit refugees in Kowloon, returned today. His staff remained in Kowloon.

### Vice President Sun Speaks on Constitutionalism and the Constitution, Elucidating Important Provisions of the Constitution

[Our Nanjing Office, 17th Dispatch] Vice President Sun Ke of the National Government, at the invitation of the Political Science University, gave a lecture to the students of the school at 2:00 PM on the 17th on "Constitutionalism and the Constitution." Sun's speech lasted for an hour and a half, and its content explained the spirit of the formulation of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the May 5th Draft Constitution. Then, he compared the important provisions of the Constitution with the constitutions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The main points included: elections; the part about the central government; the part about local government; the nomination issue of the general election; and provincial and county autonomy. Sun analyzed the differences between the current constitution and the May 5th Draft Constitution, stating that the current constitution is based on the May 5th Draft Constitution but has new changes, because the May 5th Draft Constitution was applicable to a country with one-party politics, but our country has evolved from one-party politics to multi-party politics, so the May 5th Draft Constitution was revised to become the current constitution. Regarding the election method, Sun stated that the task of the National Assembly, in addition to electing the president, also includes the power to amend the constitution and has a term of office. During this term of office, if the president's governance is not satisfactory to the people, a meeting to remove the president can be convened to exercise the power of removal, which is not the case in the United States. In the United States, the election first involves a national vote to elect "presidential electors." This election is completed after the president is elected, and the task is completed. The United States adopts parliamentary politics, so it is very difficult to amend the constitution. Whenever Congress proposes an amendment, it must be voted on by each state, so when there are difficulties, it often takes more than ten years to resolve. It is very easy in our country because the National Assembly is held every year, and there are opportunities to amend the constitution. Also, regarding the central government, the powers of the five branches of government take the Legislative Yuan as the highest legislative body of the country, with the power to control the Executive Yuan, because the President of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the president and can only be appointed after being approved by the Legislative Yuan. This type of legislation is equivalent to the cabinet responsibility system of the United Kingdom and France. Also, Article 55 of the Constitution stipulates that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and the government's policy guidelines must be approved by the Legislative Yuan before they can be implemented. However, it differs from the United Kingdom and France in that the British and French parliaments can adopt a vote of no confidence to overthrow the cabinet, while the government has the power to dissolve the parliament. Our government does not have the power of dissolution and cannot ask the president to dissolve the parliament. This point strengthens the [blank] of the Legislative Yuan and is a very novel system. If it is implemented, there must be a condition that there is an absolute majority party in the Legislative Yuan sufficient to support the Executive Yuan led by the same party, so that political turmoil and cabinet overturning movements will not occur at any time. Secondly, the position of our Control Yuan is equivalent to the upper house of other countries, but it does not have the power of the upper house, because the Control Yuan only has the power of consent. If the government is reorganized, the upper house can agree. The power to reorganize the government in our country belongs to the Legislative Yuan. Secondly, the Judicial Yuan, our Judicial Yuan added a grand justice system with the power to interpret the law. Sun explained the current implementation of the constitution, stating that the election part has been implemented, and the Legislative Yuan can be formed after the legislators are elected, as is the Control Yuan. The Executive, Judicial, and Examination branches will be formed after the president is elected. Regarding provincial and county autonomy, the central government and local governments adopt a system of balanced power. In the future, from county magistrates to provincial governors and provincial and municipal councils, all will adopt popular elections, from the bottom up. All of these are reforms. Regarding the issue of political parties nominating candidates, Sun stated that this is based on the precedents of various countries, and in various countries, only political parties can nominate candidates, and those without political party qualifications cannot participate in the election. Our country is handling it for the first time, and it is still possible to give non-partisan individuals the opportunity to sign nominations, but this National Assembly election has caused some disputes, which is actually due to a lack of experience in handling it for the first time. Sun said at the end that the government is currently carefully considering the general rules for provincial and county autonomy and has not yet made a decision.

Original Plan (2) Effectively delay the turnover rate of money.

Conclusion of Implementation Measures of the Economic Plan

The conclusion of the economic reform plan states that the following three points should be paid special attention to in order to smoothly promote this plan: 1. Reasonably resolve the treatment of officers, soldiers, civil servants, and teachers so that they can maintain the minimum necessary life, so that administrative efficiency can be improved. 2. State-owned enterprises and private enterprises should be on an equal footing and should not be discriminated against. In particular, special treatment should not be given to some private enterprises, which would increase the difficulties of legitimate private businesses. 3. A broad economic construction movement should be launched in the social sphere to increase public understanding and interest in the economy, and the difficulties of economic construction should be overcome with the strength of officer-soldier cooperation.

Implementation Measures: Given that prices are soaring without end, the treatment of officers, soldiers, civil servants, and teachers should be adjusted monthly based on the cost of living index, and important daily necessities should be distributed to stabilize their lives first, and then administrative efficiency can be improved and poverty and corruption can be eradicated. The Law on the Management of State-owned Enterprises is in the process of being legislated. Article 5 of its draft states that "Unless otherwise specifically provided by the laws of state-owned enterprises, they shall have the same rights and obligations as similar private enterprises," which clearly stipulates that state-owned and private enterprises are on an equal footing. The government should treat private enterprises equally and should not give special treatment to any part. The country will be divided into several economic regions based on natural and economic conditions, gathering local scholars, experienced professionals, or leaders from various occupational groups and society, and administrative supervisors, closely forming economic construction counseling associations, launching economic construction movements in each region, based on this program and targeting the current economic crisis and making it the basis for reform. Everyone should work together to follow the various implementation measures of the plan and promote them to all economic regions, provinces, and cities. Also, institutions should be set up to increase the promotion of the economic movement.

### The Communist Party Uses Strikes as a Weapon to Resist the Marshall Plan. The British Foreign Office Publishes the Contents of "M Directive"

[Reuters, London, 16th Dispatch] The British Foreign Office recently released the so-called "M Directive," which includes the German Communist Party's secret plan to organize strikes and sabotage the transportation system in the Ruhr region. A Foreign Office spokesman said that, based on continued intelligence, the British Foreign Office is increasingly convinced of the truth of the directive. The directive stated that this winter will be a decisive period in the history of German labor. Continuing the fight and contacting the working class throughout Europe can conquer the key positions of production. This battle is the starting point for the final struggle to win the liberation of the world proletariat and a prerequisite for achieving the final victory. In order to maintain the discipline of comrades and use all the weapons of the proletariat, the socialist homeland, the Soviet Union, will support this battle and do its best to resist the monopoly of capitalism. The Communist Information Bureau in Belgrade will coordinate the common battle of various socialist movements in Europe. Although the German Communist Party is not yet a member of the Bureau, it will gain a major position in the next battle. The working classes of all countries will provide necessary assistance, and the task of the German Communist Party is to use this assistance to achieve the best results. The main goal of the winter battle is to defeat the offensive of monopoly capitalism through the so-called Marshall Plan.

### Resolution Contains Five Parts: Focus on the Ruhr Area as the Center of Struggle, Organize a General Strike Starting This March

After careful consideration, our comrades have established the following resolution:

"Part One": The center of the people's struggle is the Ruhr area, its production, and the transportation system of West and North Germany. For technical reasons, the comrades in charge should not be at the forefront during the outbreak of the strike. However, in accordance with "Plan R," the workers' strike should be launched simultaneously in transportation and production sectors. Transportation unions and metalworkers' unions will strike successively, but the Communist Party must avoid direct participation. Based on past experience, Ruhr workers enjoy privileges superior to other workers and may refuse to strike. At this time, transportation workers should bear a significant responsibility. The Bremen-Düsseldorf railway and the Hamburg-Bielefeld railway are particularly important. The strike center for transportation workers is Dortmund. The strike in Essen should not be too conspicuous, otherwise, the entire plan will be affected. Reliable reports indicate that military authorities are prepared with reserve transportation workers to deploy when transportation strikes occur. Therefore, we must monitor all important routes and do our best to prevent the smooth progress of transportation. Our goal is not to completely block food transportation but to delay its arrival at its destination. The delay of food transportation and the strike of production industries are the main parts of our plan. Comrades Lauer, Behlert, Siegmund, and Kraski are already in pre-arranged positions. The same principle should apply to other West German strikes, that is, to unite the entire working class.

"Part Two": From an organizational point of view, the focus is on the metalworkers' union. What cannot be ignored here is obtaining or at least controlling the various assets of the union. The unity of the working class must be completed immediately. The special task is to find weaknesses in the organization and exploit them. Comrades Honisch, Trab, Gabrowski, Lewisch, Krausenhan, and Kroh have been granted the authority of the executive committee to launch the Ruhr area campaign.

"Part Three": Propaganda work should be unified under the command of the Central Executive Committee. Its goals are as follows: The Marshall Plan is a slave plan of American monopoly capitalists; The strikes in various monopoly capitalist countries are a symbol of the accelerating decline of capitalist society; The East European economy, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, is making positive progress. Here, we should consider the ban on West German Communist Party newspapers. Therefore, we should use radio and postal networks to ensure the circulation of propaganda materials. Riot cadres No. 7, 11, and 14 are responsible for publicizing the significance of referendums and public ownership of enterprises in the Ruhr area. The unity of the working class can be promoted through referendum propaganda.

"Part Four": Timeline: Complete the common foundation of the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party before the end of December to realize the referendum; Complete the organization of strike cadres before February; Organize a general strike starting from the beginning of March.

"Part Five": Supervision work is the responsibility of the MA cadres. All comrades should strictly follow the orders of the cadres.

### U.S. Exchanges Aid to Europe for Bases, Marshall Strongly Opposes, As Such a Move Would Only Increase Soviet Propaganda Power

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 17th, Broadcast: Washington News, It has been rumored that the United States will require European countries to lend bases in exchange for implementing the Marshall Plan. Marshall denied this today.

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] Authoritative sources state that Secretary of State Marshall firmly opposes Congress using the provision of military bases in the U.S. by European countries as a condition for the U.S. providing aid. He believes that this move will damage the goals of the European recovery plan, may make European countries afraid to accept aid, and will further increase the power of Soviet propaganda. It is recalled that since the end of the war, the possibility of the United States obtaining military bases in exchange has been raised in every debate on foreign aid plans. Such amendments have always been rejected as a result. It is expected that this time, it will not become a serious obstacle to the European aid plan.

### 150,000 German Workers in the Ruhr Area End One-Day Strike, Declaring That the Motive Was Hunger and Not Political

[Report from this newspaper] London, 17th, Broadcast: Ruhr News, More than 150,000 German workers in the Ruhr area resumed work at 6:00 this morning, and the 24-hour strike has come to an end. British security authorities believe that this is the first time in ten days that the Ruhr area has been quiet, with no strikes in progress and no planned strikes about to occur. However, British and American officials still believe that industrial peace cannot be maintained for long.

The chairman of the local trade union federation, Sanders, stated that if necessary, another strike will be held, and miners will be included. He denied that the strike was part of a Communist Party sabotage plan, declaring that the motive for the strike was purely hunger and not political.

[United Press, Berlin, 16th] Lieutenant General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Forces in Germany, stated: A conspiracy against the Western powers will prove to be an attempt by the Communist Party to destroy the Marshall Plan and the merger of the western occupied zones of Germany. Allied authorities are closely watching any signs of a connection between this strike (ostensibly due to food shortages) and a Communist conspiracy plan. Lieutenant General Clay also stated that the Communist conspiracy in the British and American occupied zones of Germany has already begun, but he did not explain any connection between the Ruhr area strike on the 16th and the Communist conspiracy.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] British Secretary of War Shinwell, who inspected the Ruhr area and arrived here, told reporters today that the British occupying forces cannot ignore the unrest in various parts of Germany. When asked whether he had discussed with the British commander the dispatch of troops to deal with the general strike in the Ruhr area, Shinwell indirectly answered with the above-mentioned opinion. However, he avoided directly answering various questions regarding the attitude of the British army towards the Ruhr area and Berlin, and repeatedly stated that he knew nothing about the Ruhr workers' strike and the reports in the Soviet official newspaper in Berlin that the British, American, and French occupying forces would withdraw from Berlin.

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 17th, Broadcast: Washington News, According to the U.S., if the Soviet Union can return the warships it borrowed from Britain and the United States during the war, it can obtain seven warships from the former Italian fleet, as well as others determined in the Paris Conference in February 1947.

### Fondly Concerned for Indian Friend's Health, Dean Dai Sends Special Telegram of Condolences, Gandhi Willing to Fast to Death If Hindus and Muslims Do Not Abandon Mutual Suspicion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] After Mahatma Gandhi of India fasted to appeal for Hindu-Muslim unity and cooperation, Dean Dai Chuanxian of our Examination Yuan was extremely concerned about Gandhi's health. Yesterday, he sent a special telegram to Indian Prime Minister Nehru, asking him to convey his condolences and wishing him success in his endeavor. The original telegram is as follows:

"To Ambassador Luo of the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi, India, forwarded to His Excellency Prime Minister Nehru of India: Having read in the newspaper that Mr. Gandhi has recently made a vow of great compassion and is undertaking great diligent practice, praying most purely for the peace and unity of India, I am extremely concerned. Mr. Gandhi's teachings of compassion and diligence are not only a guide for India's independence, freedom, peace, and unity but also a bright light guiding the world's humanity. His inspiration to the Chinese people is especially great. I sincerely hope that his endeavor will be successful, and I especially hope that he will be healthy in body and mind and live long in this world. Please convey this humble feeling for me."

[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] Delhi announced today as a public holiday, suspending all activities, to hold public prayer meetings to pray for Gandhi's life.

Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, princes, and dignitaries from all over the Indian peninsula sent telegrams or letters to Gandhi's residence, asking him to stop his fast, and doctors also advised him to resume eating. But Gandhi said that he only trusts God and will only end the fast after receiving God's command. The Delhi Post Office specially made a special postmark with the words "Racial Harmony Can Save Gandhi" to be stamped on various mails.

### Left-Wing Parliamentarians Attack Katayama, Plan to Force Cabinet to Collapse, Socialist Party Congress Will Decide Fate of Government

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] Political sources in Japan stated on the 17th that the result of the four-day National Congress of the Japan Socialist Democratic Party, which opens on the 19th, will determine the fate of the Katayama Cabinet. Even if the left-wing members of the Socialist Democratic Party can force Katayama to step down, they will turn to the right rather than the left afterward.

The Socialist Democratic Party held its second day of the Congress on the 17th, with 700 representatives from all over the country in attendance. Six left-wing members launched a massive attack on Prime Minister Katayama. They sharply criticized the current government for its poor implementation of social policies and stated that if it is said that the government is constrained by the four-party policy agreement formed 18 months ago due to the organization of a coalition government, then they should immediately dissolve the four-party coalition. The left-wing members of the Socialist Democratic Party account for about half of the party. They adopt a two-pronged tactic: First, seize the important party positions of the Katayama faction; second, force the party to abandon the four-party agreement. Well-informed political observers believe that if the second plan succeeds, the foundation of the Katayama Cabinet will collapse, and the Cabinet will inevitably collapse. If so, it is generally predicted that Katayama will decide to suddenly dissolve the parliament and hold a re-election. Since the left-wing members of the Socialist Democratic Party only account for half of the party's power in parliament, the election results will inevitably lead to conservative candidates being elected as the new prime minister with an overwhelming advantage. The left-wing is trying to prevent Katayama from continuing to serve as chairman of the Executive Committee and plans to replace the right-wing with left-wing Kato as secretary-general.

### Japanese Daycare Centers Kill Infants Without Bloodshed to Defraud Milk and Sugar Rations

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th] The police announced today that more than a hundred infant deaths have occurred at a daycare center run by Mrs. Ishikawa, possibly including the children of military personnel. Ishikawa, 52, has admitted a total of 203 infants since opening the daycare center in 1944, most of whom are illegitimate children of dancers, maids, and widows. Each infant costs 5,000 to 8,000 yen, and the parents will not be allowed to reclaim them in the future. The center then secretly kills them to defraud the government of special rations of milk and sugar for infants and the deceased, and resell them on the market to make money. The Japanese people pride themselves on treating children with kindness and love, but this news has aroused indignation, and it is even more sensational than other crimes after the war.

### American PhD Predicts That Epidemics Will Invade the World

[United Press, Chicago, 17th] Dr. Peterson, director of research at St. Luke's Hospital and former professor of pathology at the University of Illinois, has been studying the relationship between the sun and humans for many years. Based on his experience, he has written a book entitled "Climate, Man, Sun," which has been completed. The doctor predicts that the world will suffer several waves of epidemics this year, and the number of deaths may exceed normal years. Epidemics are related to sunspots, and the large number of sunspots this year will be the most in 200 years. The sunspot cycle can create climate and cause human fatigue.

Representing Romania in signing the treaty were Prime Minister Groza and Foreign Minister Pauker.

Yesterday was Saturday, and the consulate was closed as usual in the afternoon. When the students arrived, the consulate staff had already left. To prevent accidents, the city government had previously sent Police Chief Lu Dagong and police to protect the consulate and had the gate closed tightly.

The students from each school divided into northwest and southeast areas and began to form teams to walk or take vehicles at 12:30, gathering continuously in front of the Bund Park Square. Along the way through Nanjing Road and Zhongzheng East Road, they posted slogans, chanted slogans, or sang songs protesting the atrocities. Patriotic emotions were high and enthusiastic, but the order was well-maintained. Passersby stopped to watch, and the road was temporarily blocked. The students responsible for propaganda first went to the consulate to post slogans, and several representatives negotiated with Section Chief Lu, requesting the opening of the consulate gate so that students could enter and deliver a letter of protest to the British consul in person. After Lu explained in polite terms that the consulate staff was not in the consulate, he said that the letter of protest could be left behind and he would forward it on their behalf. Then, the student group went to the front of the consulate at 2:55, and traffic to and from was completely cut off. The students were unable to enter the consulate and shouted slogans outside, and the situation was once tense.

Mayor Wu and Bureau Chief Yu Arrive One After the Other

Then the students proposed to remove the British flag hanging in the consulate and replace it with the national flag. Wu Zhendong from Jiaotong University, Lin Shide from Tongji University, and four others were immediately elected as representatives to hold it and negotiate with Lu. They initially argued with the police on the scene for a long time, but after the earnest explanation of Bureau Chief Yu and others that this was a violation of international law, their request was not granted. The representatives immediately went out and reported the results of the negotiations to the crowd of students gathered at the gate. All the students expressed satisfaction and left in applause and shouts of slogans. At that time, Mayor Wu also rushed to the British Consulate. Seeing that the atmosphere had already eased, he lingered briefly and then dispersed separately. The police bureau dispatched additional police along the way to protect them, and the order was good.

[Another report] The faculty, staff, and students of Hujiang University and Great China University issued a declaration yesterday regarding the Kowloon City incident. All faculty and staff of the National Shanghai Medical College sent a telegram to Foreign Minister Wang, asking him to argue with the British government on the basis of reason to calm public outrage.

### Kowloon City House Demolition Incident: General Labour Union Issues Two-Point Statement

[Our Report] Regarding the Hong Kong police's forceful demolition of civilian houses in Kowloon City, the Municipal General Labour Union held a special executive council meeting yesterday and resolved to issue a two-point statement: (1) To request the government to adopt a firm diplomatic stance and promptly prevent the expansion of the unfortunate Kowloon City incident, and strive for a satisfactory resolution. (2) All workers in the city should maintain a calm mind, adhere to their work posts, and refrain from rash actions to avoid increasing the government's diplomatic difficulties. According to Secretary-General Liang Yongzhang, the General Labour Union had previously suggested to the government last year that Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau be reclaimed. In this Kowloon City incident, the British side acted unilaterally, undermining Sino-British friendship. The 800,000 workers of Shanghai express deep indignation and are determined to unite and serve as a backing for the government to lodge a firm protest with the British government.

### Elementary School Students Donate Candy Money to Inquire About Displaced Compatriots

[Our Report] As the situation in the Kowloon house demolition incident deteriorates, all sectors of the country are deeply concerned. Yesterday, the self-government association of the Seventeenth District Central National School in this city sent a letter to this newspaper, along with 840,000 yuan donated by students from their candy money, requesting that this newspaper remit it to Kowloon to express sympathy to the affected compatriots. The letter stated, "The funds were voluntarily and enthusiastically donated by these elementary school students. Some donated 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, others 2,000 to 1,000 yuan, and even 500 yuan. Everyone was eager and enthusiastic, unanimously expressing their indignation at the Kowloon incident. Furthermore, we hope that compatriots across the country can hold widespread donations and contribute their mite to help the compatriots in Kowloon who have been displaced for the sake of fighting for national sovereignty."

The staff of this newspaper, in addition to respecting the wishes of the students of the school and finding a way to remit the funds, also expresses our gratitude for the national consciousness and humanitarianism demonstrated by the elementary school students.

### Zhejiang-Chengdu Middle School Massacre: Deng Qirong Suffers Dozens of Stab Wounds; Principal Offender Zhang Huidong Under Strict Interrogation; Large-Scale Assassination Organization Discovered Among Students

[Report from Chengdu on the 10th] Zhejiang-Chengdu Middle School, located outside Chengdu, held its school sports day on the 3rd. Student Deng Qirong, after completing the 200-meter race, was invited by another classmate to talk outside the school. Less than a hundred steps outside the school, on the riverbank, more than twenty young men, resembling both students and vagrants, suddenly emerged from the roadside, wielding sharp knives and stabbing Deng all over his body. He suffered dozens of injuries on the spot, covered in blood, and barely breathing. The vagrants were about to throw Deng into the river when his classmates heard the sound and rushed out. The vagrants then dispersed in all directions. Afterwards, Deng was admitted to West China Union University Hospital for treatment, and the Provincial Capital Police Bureau launched an investigation. On the 6th, Zhang Huidong, the principal offender who invited Deng out, was arrested. He is a senior high school student at the school. According to Zhang Huidong's confession to the Judicial Section of the bureau: "Deng was the chairman of the student self-government association and also a member of the school basketball team. Last week, Deng asked Zhang to return the school-issued basketball uniform, and Zhang harbored resentment, and the intention to kill arose." Zhang also confessed: "The murderers of Deng were members of an assassination group within the student community. He (Zhang) is also a member of the group. This organization is large-scale, with more than a thousand members, all students from various schools in Chengdu. Their usual actions and targets have a certain pattern. The targets of assassinations are mostly classmates, and their arrangements are very planned and organized." The police bureau has, based on this confession, worked with the Department of Education to conduct a thorough investigation, and will crack the entire organization in the short term, and severely punish the participating students in order to rectify the academic atmosphere and maintain the rule of law. The murdered Deng usually abided by school rules. His eldest brother, Qiding, is currently an editor in the Provincial Government Legal Affairs Office. His second brother, Qiyu, is currently studying at MIT in the United States. Deng's knife wounds penetrated his intestines and stomach, and his life is in critical condition.

### New Situation in the Pacification of Northern Jiangsu

[Report from Huaiyin on the 12th] Along with the passage of ruthless years, the pacification work in Northern Jiangsu has spent another dull year of 1947 under the principle of "avoiding main force battles" by the communist bandits. Reviewing the pacification work of the past year, there has indeed never been a fierce battle fought in Northern Jiangsu. However, we can draw a conclusion that as long as we encounter the main force of the bandit army, the national army can always fight a genuine victory and reap fruitful results. The Battle of Sujiazu in August, the Battle of Suining in October, the Battle of Wulizhuang and Qianjiaji in November, and the battles north of Siyang in December are all good examples.

Especially from Christmas last year to the New Year this year, in just a few days, the national army's suppression troops presented the people of Northern Jiangsu with a grand gift in the form of a great harvest on the Tongyu line. The battle process that has expanded the pacification situation in Northern Jiangsu is as follows: The "Heaven, Earth, and Man" divisions of the national army, led personally by Division Commander Wang, advanced from Dongtai, practicing the first step in the large-scale suppression plan formulated by Zhang Xuezhong, Commander of the Huaihai Pacification District. Guan Wenwei, the highest commander of the Northern Jiangsu communist bandits, said in their cadre meeting after the Battle of Libao: "The Battle of Libao was a minor victory, and in the future, we will fight a major victory for you to see." So he placed all the main forces of the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns, which he rarely used, on the line from Wuyou to Biancang. This is an

excellent opportunity

undoubtedly for the national army. For a year, the main force of the suppression army has only encountered one regiment or one brigade, and has not been able to thoroughly suppress them. This time they have sent all their limited main force to our door. This kind of opportunity is really too rare. In the bandits' thinking, they know that the national army's strength in Northern Jiangsu is not very large. If they can eliminate all the suppression troops this time, they can drive south and directly attack Jiangnan, and attempt to do something in Nanjing and Shanghai.

The battle began at 5:00 PM on the 26th, with Biancang and Baijiaxiang (three li south of Wuyou) as the core,展开猛烈的战斗. The bandits used a successive attack method, increasing three regiments of troops every day. When the battle first started on the 26th, the bandits' combat troops were only 10,000 men. By the 27th, it increased to more than 20,000, and on the 28th, it increased to more than 30,000. On the 29th, they took out all sixteen regiments of their main force, and the battle reached its climax.

Commander Zhang Xuezhong had convened the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Meeting in Zhenjiang, and rushed to Huaiyin in the afternoon of the 28th. From the 28th onwards, for two days and nights, he

did not sleep, wholeheartedly commanding the frontline battle.

At this time, in order to implement the determination to wipe out the main force of the bandits, the national army sent another batch of elite troops from Dongtai to participate in the battle, and a large number of air force also came to assist. In addition, the national army departing from between Lianghuai arrived at Donggou Yilin, and a certain brigade of the garrison in Funing also began to move south, completing a three-sided encirclement deployment.

After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the bandits' elite Thirty-second and Thirty-fifth Brigades were defeated. After suffering 15,000 casualties, the bandits retreated their routed remnants to their old nest of Hede Town on the afternoon of the 30th. After waiting for a

new deployment to be completed, the national army will really attack their nest.

The reporter recently met with Commander Zhang Yunzhong at the command headquarters of the Pacification District. He was sitting next to the telephone, and during his busy command, he analyzed the cause and effect of this battle to the reporter with an excited expression. He said: "The main force of the bandits has lost more than half of its strength in this battle. The burden of the pacification work in Northern Jiangsu will be greatly reduced in the future."

The main force of the bandit army left in Northern Jiangsu is actually only the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns. However, for a year, they have always responded to the national army's suppression with a wandering method, so that the pacification work cannot smoothly reach the ideal state. This major blow to the bandit army's main force is undoubtedly a turning point for the pacification work in Northern Jiangsu in the future.

At the same time, another obstacle to the pacification work is the inability to effectively coordinate military and government affairs. On this point, in the

Six-Province Joint Defense Conference two months ago, there was an important decision, which is: The Pacification District will be supervised by the Provincial Chairman in the future, and the commander of the Pacification District has absolute command over the commissioners and county magistrates within his jurisdiction. Therefore, the commander of the Pacification District is lower in name, but his powers have been expanded, and therefore military-government coordination can be further strengthened.

The Huaihai Pacification District, under the leadership of General Zhang Xuezhong, has been decided by the highest military authorities to be expanded and reorganized into the Seventh Pacification District, and its jurisdiction has also been expanded to the Longhai Line. Starting from the New Year, after a week of intense work,

the Seventh Pacification District

has been reorganized. And it has been decided that a pacification meeting will be convened in a few days - on the 12th, at which the commissioners and county magistrates within the jurisdiction, the party secretaries, the speakers of the council, and the commanders of the troops above the regimental level will come to Huaiyin to attend and discuss the grand plan for the pacification of Northern Jiangsu.

A series of news has told every person in Northern Jiangsu that the situation in Northern Jiangsu will have a decisive development in the short term. Millions of people yearning for rule are welcoming this new situation with a feeling of unparalleled excitement!

### Academia Sinica Sends Letter to US Requesting 20 Types of Radioactive Isotopes

Radioactive isotopes, in modern "medicine" and "chemical," "biological," "industrial," and "agricultural" applications, especially in the diagnosis of diseases, are praised by the scientific community as a major discovery since the invention of the microscope. The US Atomic Energy Commission has decided to universally supply 20 kinds of radioactive isotopes to various countries for academic research in medicine and biology. However, radioactive isotopes related to industrial and military atomic energy research are still prohibited from export. The Chinese Science Society in this city has received 12 photos and instructions regarding the manufacturing and application of radioactive isotopes donated by the United States, which are currently on display in the society's [omitted word]. The Institute of [omitted word] of Academia Sinica has sent a letter to the United States requesting these 20 kinds of isotopes for academic research.

According to the documents provided by the US Atomic Energy Commission, radioactive isotopes are products of [omitted word] pile-style reactions. The Clinton National Laboratory in Tennessee has produced over 100 kinds of products, some of which are major [omitted word] treatment drugs for certain diseases, but their greatest use in biology and medicine is for tracer technology. The method involves using radioactive elements or other compounds on the internal tissues [omitted word] such as cancer, and even in complex chemical reactions, its radioactivity can be used to detect it. It is now widely used in American cancer hospitals. In medical terms, it has been discovered that radioactive gold elements can be used to diagnose and treat chronic leukemia, so radioactive sodium is used to treat edema. In New York, large-scale research on the treatment of cancer with radioactive isotopes is underway. In biology, radioactive iron can be used to prevent certain plant diseases, which will save the United States and Britain millions of dollars annually in losses due to plant diseases. Hawaiian sugarcane merchants are experimenting with using radioactive carbon for fertilization to increase production. In industry, radioactive steel can resist wear and tear on machinery. Other radioactive isotopes can be used to survey the penetration zones of oil. In agriculture, the amount of phosphate and potassium carbonate in the soil can be identified by its radioactive isotopes to determine the amount of fertilizer applied, thereby increasing grain production. In entomology, the feeding habits of insects can be detected by radioactive [omitted word], which can provide a reference for the prevention and control of plant diseases and pests.

Regarding the shortage of raw cotton and the fact that smaller factories will stop work due to insufficient raw materials, it is reported that the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee has [omitted word] permission to prepare a portion of cotton for allocation to the factories first, in exchange for yarn. It is said that this transitional measure can be decided whether to implement it after the chairman of the committee, Yuan Liang, returns to Shanghai.

Also, the association, in response to requests from various guilds, has extended the registration deadline for yarn and cloth merchants and replication merchants to next Monday.

Cotton Yarn Gains in Price

Yesterday's cotton yarn market condition was that the price had fallen sharply for days, and at the beginning, the client gang came to absorb at low prices, and this street was also slightly active, and the asking price turned firm. Afterwards, it was reported that the unified tax on cotton yarn was increased by more than 10%, and people's minds were particularly strong. Forty-two branches of Blue Phoenix fine yarn rushed out of the 60 million mark in the middle of the way, reaching 60.2 million yuan. At that time, colleagues who were in trouble with funds took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the market rebounded again. But in the end, compared with the previous day, the price increased by 1.2 million yuan, to 59.5 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns rose by 500,000 to 1.2 million yuan.

Fine Cloth Rises

In the cotton cloth market, the morning opening was due to the easing of monetary policy, floating [omitted word] compensation, new buying activities, customers from Taiwan, Hankou, Ningbo and other gangs, slightly absorbed, but the strength faction still sold at high prices. But as a result of the touting from all sides, the price of various grades of 12-pound fine cloth rose from 12,000 to 45,000 yuan compared with the previous day. In addition, [omitted word] bleached cloth, straight tribute, Shilin cloth, etc., also rose by more than 10,000 to about 100,000, while other coarse cloth twills, etc., showed mixed ups and downs.

Cotton Market Continues to Weaken

Yesterday's spot cotton market situation continued to weaken. The opening price of Textile Construction was too low, and cargo owners were unwilling to sell lightly, so no transaction was heard. Colleagues, due to the extraordinarily tight monetary policy, and the relationship on Saturday, there were not enough staff in the afternoon, so transactions were scarce. 120 bales were traded, with the factory price being 4.96 million for Kaitongzhou fine velvet, the warehouse price being 5.111 million for Ling [omitted word], and 1.06 million for Zhoupu seed cotton, down 70,000.

### China Textile Company Announces December Production

### Rayon Slightly Firm; Silk Goods Do Not Fluctuate Much

Monetary policy was slightly loose, and there was a slight decrease in appetite. The closing price was 5 million yuan for the Zhouyi period. In the afternoon trading, the opening price was 4 million yuan, which was 3 million yuan higher than the previous day.

Factory Yarn

The market was quiet yesterday, and transactions were scarce. Only Gao Ye [omitted word] traded two or three packages, with the spot price being 3 million yuan, and the three-day period being 5 million yuan. There were few transactions in the five-dan heads of various grades, and the asking price was slightly firmer than the previous day. Qianjing had no transactions, and the market was stable.

Silk Goods

The market was slightly firm yesterday. Huajiang Zhen [omitted word] was opened at around 9.8 million yuan, and supply and demand were relatively balanced. The up and down was slight. The closing price was 40.1 million yuan for the spot period and 1.2 million yuan for the Zhouyi period. The afternoon market was softer, at around 800,000 [omitted word].

### The Dyeing and Weaving Industry of One City and Five Counties: A Joint Meeting Convened Today, Aiming for Unity Among Businesses in Response to National Policies

The dyeing and weaving industry of Shanghai and the five counties of Changzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangyin, and Wuxian, owns more than 40,000 looms, accounting for more than eight-tenths of the national cotton yarn replication production equipment. Recently, due to the unified purchase and distribution by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, a meeting is scheduled to be held in this city today (the 18th) to discuss response methods. More than sixty or seventy principal persons in charge of local trade associations have reported to the Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Trade Association. At noon today, they will convene at the Wenqi Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School in Minhang Town, and at 6 p.m., there will be a social dinner at the International Hotel. According to its spokesperson, the previous yarn allocation system was imperfect. Factories that were excluded still have to rely on the black market for yarn. Since the government began selling yarn in the market, the situation has improved slightly. However, due to insufficient yarn factory production, replication and turnover are difficult. Currently, no more than half of the businesses in various places are operating. The loss of work and time is regrettable. The cloth produced by one city and five counties has always been the general hub for supplying the whole country. If it is disrupted, the supply in various places will be even more worrying. Effective measures will be discussed at this meeting to submit to the government. The spokesperson also pointed out that the authorities are currently handling the registration of replication factories, and the deadline is pressing. Some businesses have not had time to complete the registration. The trade association has already submitted reasons and requested an extension. If the request is not granted, how will these manufacturers excluded from the control line survive? It is a significant issue. It is said that when the government previously handled registration, the excessive number of required documents and the tight deadline caused some factories that were actually in production to not be able to complete the registration in time and were unable to obtain yarn allocation.

### Rice Market Weak, Oil Market Rebounds Universally

Yesterday, a total of more than 11,700 stones of rice arrived in the North and South markets. Credit was tight, digestion was still sluggish, and the market continued to weaken. Japonica rice for early and thin rice was cut by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, indica rice fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and white medium and sub-quality rice continued to fall by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

Flour opened sharply lower in the morning, rallied at noon, and ended down more than 10,000 yuan. Bran saw a sharp drop of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan but was also firm at the close.

Bean cake transactions were active in Xiamen, and rural areas were slightly active, rebounding by more than 10,000 yuan. Soybean sales sentiment turned firm, digestion was slightly active, and rebounded by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Mung beans gradually showed signs of recovery, with prices stable in name but firm in reality. Adzuki beans were sluggish, and broad beans rose slightly by 10,000 yuan. Cowpeas temporarily formed a stable pattern. Red sorghum arrivals and sales were both slow, and prices did not rise or fall.

Corn reappeared for sale at high prices in Beiyang, turning firm after weakness, soaring by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Sesame supply and demand were balanced, with little price fluctuation for both black and white sesame, but milk sesame was firm by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had acceptable sales, rebounding by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.

After a sharp drop in the oil market, stores and stomachs turned strong, taking advantage of the low prices. All oils rebounded uniformly, with soybean oil, raw oil, and rapeseed oil successively rising by more than 100,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grain Shipped North

[Our Newspaper News] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Qimei Wheel, loaded with more than 1,000 tons of rice, sailed to Qingdao yesterday. Zhixin Wheel, loaded with 2,300 tons of flour and groceries, also sailed to Qingdao. Huangxing Wheel, loaded with 2,000 tons of rice, sailed to Tianjin today.

### Rental Income Tax: Landlords Request Tax on Actual Income

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Banking, Trust, and Real Estate Trade Association previously withheld property rental income tax on behalf of entrusted lease management companies. Landlords have claimed that prices have been high recently, and general rents cannot increase in proportion to prices. Profits from renting and buying are limited to 10% of actual expenditures, and the income of landlords is very small. Furthermore, due to contractual relationships, rents cannot be arbitrarily increased unilaterally within a certain period, and some even suffer losses. If taxes are levied based on income, it will impose an excessive burden on landlords and be unfair. Therefore, they jointly petitioned the Ministry of Finance, requesting taxation based on actual income and requesting an explanation of the reporting and calculation standards. The Ministry of Finance has already approved, stating that the property rental income tax is based on actual rental income as the object of taxation. The various expenses that should be deducted when calculating income should be handled in accordance with the tax law. The association should inform its members to handle it accordingly.

Soap Prices Rise

The household soap market has been silent since the state's allocation news subsided. The sharp declines in the previous days led to manufacturers actively buying. As a result, both the Guben and Arrow soaps rebounded by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and Huang Xiangmao also rose by 25,000 yuan. The market for the remaining Guanghua and Meili soaps was firm. Old-brand Meili Phoenix matches rose by 200,000 yuan, while miscellaneous brands remained weak.

Tea Market Quiet

Domestic tea sales remained strong due to continued consumption by this street and various gangs. As for export tea, exporters continued to hold back, and the market remained quiet, while prices rose uniformly. The reason is that dealers, seeing that market inventories are exhausted, have intensified their efforts to hoard and raise prices. By the close of the market, prices had risen across the board. However, some varieties remained firm due to the quality of the goods, with the situation appearing stable on the surface but quietly firm underneath.

### Government Bonds Rise, Foreign Stocks Fall

Government bonds yesterday saw an expansion of the rising trend, frequently reaching new highs, due to the arrival of our delegation in Washington and renewed speculation about the currency system. Tongbing opened at 60,000 yuan and rose to 94,000 yuan before retreating to around 85,000 yuan.

Compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi rose by 2,100, Bing rose by 2,500, Ding rose by 2,000 yuan, and Wu Hao rose by 2,200, with a transaction volume of approximately 6 million.

Foreign stocks were weak yesterday due to unexpected events in Guangzhou and renewed anxiety, coupled with the Shanghai telegram rising to 3.4 yuan. Jardine Spinning opened at 545,000 yuan, fell to 530,000 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Guangdong securities brokers and retail investors were slightly active. Compared to the previous close, Jardine Spinning, paper, shipping, Changche, telephone, and Xiangtai stocks each fell by half a percent, and the rest fell slightly.

### Sellers Repeatedly Dump, Chinese Stocks Firm Then Weaken

Chinese stocks were in good spirits yesterday, but young bulls took advantage of the high prices to take profits. Amid renewed reports of long positions in Guangdong stocks in Hong Kong, sellers repeatedly dumped, and credit remained tight, leading to a firm then weak trend. Small-cap stocks were briefly popular but later collapsed.

The morning opening saw both gains and losses. Wing On Spinning debuted at 750 yuan for immediate delivery and 785 yuan for deferred delivery, rising to highs of 770 yuan and 802 yuan after opening. Among the small-cap stocks, the three hot stocks showed renewed vitality, with Xinguang rising the fastest. However, selling pressure was very strong, with interest rates opening high at 28.5 cents and 23 cents. Hong Kong Electric reported a long position of 3.4 yuan, and there were rumors of US loans. Wing On Spinning gradually fell to lows of 718 yuan and 752 yuan, before being pulled back up to 728 yuan and 760 yuan. The situation then hovered without much change. The noon close was 721 yuan and 756 yuan. After falling to the limit, Huaxin rebounded. Compared to the previous close, immediate delivery stocks saw Zhongfang rise slightly, Matches, Wuhe, and Shangping were flat, Meiya fell by 10%, and Xinhe, Huayu, Zhongfa, Xinhua, Rongyu, Tongyi, Zhongsishangwu, and Neiyi all fell by half a percent, with the rest falling slightly. Among the deferred delivery stocks, Meiya fell by 10%, Huayu, Jingfu, and Xinhe fell by half a percent, and Qin Xing saw little trading but rose by half a percent. Xinguang and Wing On Spinning fell slightly. Off-exchange unlisted stocks also saw more selling than buying due to tight credit.

### Sugar Market Trading Halts Due to the Impact of Tongzhongji's Bankruptcy

The sugar market suddenly halted trading yesterday morning. Since Tongzhongji's bankruptcy, the matter has not yet been resolved. Creditors convened an emergency meeting and unanimously agreed that brokers should also be held responsible. After the meeting, they reported to the authorities, who summoned several brokers. The brokers, however, believed that their commission income was minimal (700 yuan per bag) and that they could not bear this heavy responsibility. Therefore, they voluntarily suspended trading from yesterday to discuss a proper solution.

### End-of-Year Musings

— Jingwen

The old year is ending, and the New Year is almost here.

The Gregorian New Year has just passed, but in the minds of most people, the Lunar New Year is the true New Year. This may be a deeply ingrained habit that cannot be changed in a short time. However, the Lunar New Year does have many ritualistic embellishments that are reminiscent of religion, making it difficult for people to easily forget. After entering the twentieth day of the twelfth lunar month, there is a series of New Year festivals, such as sending off the Kitchen God, welcoming the Kitchen God, making cakes, doing a major cleaning, and eating New Year's Eve dinner. On New Year's Eve, everyone is extremely nervous, and everyone seems to have a special feeling. Although everyone knows that it is just another event, no one can escape tradition. However, precisely because of this, the profound power of a nation's customs and habits is manifested.

The Gregorian New Year lacks the backdrop of customs and traditions, so although it is a national holiday, there is little tension. I remember that when the government first announced the implementation of the Gregorian New Year, the police authorities in the capital once ordered merchants not to close during the Lunar New Year. As a result, the order was withdrawn after considering the difficulty of changing public sentiment. Although the Lunar New Year still occupies an unofficial status, it has gained widespread recognition under the name of Spring Festival.

Amid the promotion of frugality, it is not very reasonable to have two New Years in less than two months. However, as long as the agricultural society in our country has not changed, the Lunar New Year will probably have to continue. Westerners celebrate Christmas and then the New Year, while we prepare for the Lunar New Year after sending off the Kitchen God. Although the methods are different, they are all customs and habits of the same nation.

Some people believe that the customs and habits of a nation should cater to the global trend. In other words, customs and habits should strive for progress and aspire to reach the ultimate goal of a high degree of unification of human culture and civilization. This is certainly an undeniable view. So-called customs and habits and national culture are not fixed and immutable because whether it is customs and habits or cultural traditions, they are all the result of a certain way of life, and although lifestyles do not change all the time, they are rich in changeability.

Now, when we encounter the New Year and festivals, although we still maintain many traditional rituals, they are much diluted compared to ten or twenty years ago. This is partly because the people's livelihood is difficult, and everyone is no longer interested, and partly because we have been influenced by higher world cultures.

Although culture is an abstract thing, its influence can be seen and felt over time. For example, Christmas, one of the cultures of Christianity, has gradually become a fixed program in Chinese urban society. Conversely, our old-fashioned holidays are gradually being diluted. Even in daily life, the influence of Western lifestyle culture is eroding our traditional habits.

You may say that this is our progress, and it is not impossible because Western lifestyle culture does have many places that are more reasonable than our inherent ones, but sometimes you feel a little melancholy. Although you know that what you are getting now is perhaps more valuable than what you have lost, you still feel a sense of loss. You feel that this psychological feeling cannot be explained by simple nostalgia. Nostalgia may be inevitable, but your sadness is actually deeper than this.

In fact, it is not surprising. Because the new lifestyle culture that we are now accepting is just old wine in a new wineskin. Although the packaging is changing, the content is not only the same as before but is also corroding. Wine is certainly better the older it gets, but although a nation's lifestyle culture must also undergo a fermentation process, it is certainly not better the older it gets. The reason why we have to bow our heads to higher foreign cultures is proof of this. Real wine has nothing to do with the vessel in which it is stored, but a lifestyle culture brewed from life must have a consistent relationship between appearance and reality.

I am not saying that inherent lifestyle habits should not be abolished, but that a nation's lifestyle culture should cultivate new life from its own blood. The Lunar New Year and the Gregorian New Year are just forms. Only by creating new content can we finally decide all forms of life.

### Retired Teachers

— Yan Ping

In the Education News section of the Shen Bao on the 13th of this month, I saw an extremely plain and painful report.

According to the report, a certain retired teacher, because he was too old to continue teaching, had received a retirement pension from the Bureau of Education. Because the teacher had difficulty making a living, he submitted a request to the Bureau of Education to forward it to the municipal government, requesting an in-kind allocation. After being forwarded to the Executive Yuan for review, the request was ultimately denied because the allocation of in-kind goods to retired teachers was not in compliance with regulations.

Let us put aside the question of whether retired teachers should receive an allocation and discuss the livelihood problems of retired teachers in detail:

Everyone agrees that teachers' salaries are extremely meager. Even being able to barely maintain the minimum daily life while still employed is a blessing, and there is no possibility of saving. Once they retire in old age, unless their children are able to support them, they are destined to suffer in their old age. I think readers still remember the tragedy of an old teacher committing suicide by jumping into the river, right?

The teacher seems to be too extravagant in requesting an in-kind allocation. Although he was once a "public employee," now that he has retired, he has of course broken away from the words "public employee." As a non-public employee, how could he obtain approval to request a public employee allocation?

Moreover, under the principle that education does not distinguish between public and private, private school teachers, simply because they have the title of "private," are not entitled to enjoy the preferential treatment of "public employees"! Therefore, the reply of "unapproved" to the retired teacher's request for an in-kind allocation is inevitable!

Since the teacher retired because he was "old," he must have served in the education sector for a long time. His students over the years must be all over the world, and perhaps some of them have become wealthy and powerful people. But can they still remember the teacher who cultivated them in their youth?

However, the teacher was fortunate enough to have been a teacher in a municipal school! At least he received a retirement pension from the Bureau of Education upon retirement. Although it is only a few tens of yuan per month, it is still adjusted according to the index. No matter what, it is better than nothing, right?

"Better than the worst, but not as good as the best." I don't know where the approximately 20,000 private school teachers in the city will go to receive even a small retirement pension when they retire in old age in the future?

### Sugar and Crime

Doctors and psychiatrists at the New Zealand Prison have offered a most original opinion on the reasons for crime and possible treatments. While investigating various crimes, they found that the blood of criminals was deficient in glucose.

"Lack of sugar makes individuals have criminal and violent behavior, movements are crude and fierce, and they are prone to anger," they said. "This phenomenon can be avoided as long as the sugar content in the individual's body is increased."

This may be one of the many reasons why criminal events occur daily in Europe. (Tuó)

### Warmth

— Binru

Humans have inspiration, so they cannot do without warmth. This is also the natural requirement of animal life, which no one can deny.

Some cold people are often frighteningly cold, making it impossible to approach them, or they can only deal with them superficially. This is the surface that adapts to the social environment, but in fact, these people are not cruel. In the blink of an eye, you will be surprised. Their emotions are often richer than you can imagine. Chinese people like King Xiang of Chu and foreigners like Hitler are typical of this kind.

Without much pulling, I am now thinking about my own affairs. The colleagues or friends, not to mention those who work in the same place, and even more so those who are scattered in various places, always want to chat. Seeing each other every day in the workplace is generally not enough, and naturally, you want to see those who are scattered in other places even more. Therefore, you must find an opportunity to make an appointment to meet in places other than the workplace, such as teahouses, Siyi shops, or a friend's house.

One day, I heard Xiping and Lao Lu make an appointment to drink tea and eat dim sum at Longji tomorrow. The next day, I automatically joined them. Unfortunately, I arrived too late. When I stepped into Longji Teahouse, it was already 4:00 p.m. I saw the waiter already starting to clean up, putting all the stools on the table upside down, leaving only Xiping, a guest, quietly leaning on a chair in the corner of the wall, like all the garbage on the ground, waiting for the waiter to clean up.

I said first:

"Alone?"

"Lao Lu broke his promise."

Xiping handed me a cigarette, so I sat down too.

Regarding breach of promise, we all don't pay much attention to it because sometimes the sun and the moon will also break their promises. There was no sun this day. Xiping's so-called breach of promise was probably because the sun broke its promise, and he had to take Lao Lu's breach of promise seriously. It was gloomy outside the window. Xiping looked at the ceiling and said:

"It looks like it's going to snow!"

The waiter hummed a Cantonese tune while sweeping the floor. Seven or eight tables were already covered with the feet of stools facing the sky. A desolate humor embellished the tragedy of life, and at the same time touched people's sophistication. So I said:

"Closing time!"

The waiter suddenly looked up and smiled at me. He said:

"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if you sit for a while."

Not only did it not matter, but he put down the broom and brought boiling water to fill our teapot again.

I couldn't help but smile; the house and the outside were actually the same gray, but at this time I felt that the sky outside was even darker. Sometimes warmth is very hurtful, but humans are born with self-abuse mania.

So we had to leave the teahouse indifferently, and then leave Xiping, until we could no longer hear the waiter's Cantonese tune, until the heads of people busily working at their desks under the lamps replaced the feet of stools on many tables, and then we thought about when to meet with friends somewhere else.

This proves that light cannot replace the sun, and even the gray sky is not as good. Those who emphasize that life is work have a suspicion of turning living humans into dead machines. Suppressing human nature is ultimately impossible, which is why the world is constantly in turmoil. It is not possible to make a big deal out of a small issue. It should be over now. I say: all the abuse that humans can, want, love, and endure, except for warmth, is not worth mentioning.

Chapter 6 Calamities Never Come Singly (45)

Qing smiled and said, "You are only planning for yourself and not thinking about others." Zhu Qi said, "I am purely planning for others. If I were only planning for myself, I would go to a monastery and become a monk, which would be the easiest way!" Qing said, "Okay! Don't talk about becoming a monk. I have heard these words so many times. I only hope that you will not lose your conscience when things are done in the future and disappoint others." Zhu Qi said, "I won't do that unless I lose my initial purpose!" Xiang said, "I only hope she can realize it. It will be easy to handle. If she stubbornly refuses, I can't do anything about it. I will try it for the future happiness of you two." Zhu Qi bowed repeatedly and said, "That's great. You just go there once." Yun Qing said, "This matter cannot be resolved in a few words, nor can it be successful by going to see her once. If it doesn't succeed and something happens, don't blame me!" Zhu Qi said, "If it doesn't succeed, I'm just unlucky. Nothing will happen." Yun Qing said, "Why not? If she thinks what you say is wrong, she will tell your father, isn't that bad? Even if she doesn't tell your father and has a big quarrel with you, you can't bear it." Zhu Qi said, "I'm not afraid of arguing with her; telling my father would be terrible. I'm relying on you to influence her, telling her to understand the pros and cons tomorrow and automatically propose a divorce. That would be the best. With your talent, you can definitely succeed in these little things." As he said this, he bowed repeatedly. Yun Qing just sat still, stopped for a while, and changed his face and said, "I still have to ask you a question. If this matter is successful, what is the first step you will take?" Zhu Qi said, "Can't you guess the second step? I don't think I need to say more." As he spoke, he folded his middle finger and thumb and raised it to Yun Qing's face with a slap. Yun Qing's face turned red and said, "Don't be happy, I think there will be many difficulties in the future!" Zhu Qi said, "Didn't you say that things are done by people, and those who have a will will succeed? I'm going to do it with all my strength. Do you dare to say you don't have this courage?" Yun Qing said, "Don't brag. When your father loses his temper, let's see if you dare to go all out?" Zhu Qi laughed and said, "No, no, I was very sad today, but you made me feel so happy. How about we go out for a small restaurant?" Yun Qing said, "No need, I already told them to prepare dinner when you came." Zhu Qi looked at his watch and said, "After we finish eating, will you go there once for me?" Yun Qing said, "You are so impatient. If I don't go, you will blame me for not being enthusiastic. You need to know that I am not impatient. I feel like I owe a debt when I promise someone something. I don't feel comfortable until I pay it off immediately." As he said this, the two smiled tacitly.

### "Name" and "Reality"

— Tan Zhengbi

Whenever something is excellent in a foreign country, once it is moved to our China, regardless of whether it is a big or small matter, it invariably changes in quality and deviates from the original. It's not that I agree with the saying that the moon is better abroad, but the fact is that there are very few exceptions, so I dare to make this judgment.

Just to give an example from my own field of expertise. In public schools, so-called public-funded students, of course, have all their tuition, meals, accommodation, and even uniforms and miscellaneous expenses, provided by the government. Moreover, I have seen in the newspapers the magnificent regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education, which also stipulate this. However, what is the reality? I have a child who was admitted to a provincial normal school last year. When he first entered the school, he had to pay for medical care, books, experiments, materials, uniforms, etc., as usual. Moreover, he also had to submit eighty catties of white rice. If he didn't pay it clearly, he couldn't even think about living in the school, let alone attending classes. It is said that the eighty catties of white rice were because the provincial government was in arrears with the public funds, and the school couldn't afford to advance it, so it was temporarily borrowed and would be returned in full at the end of the semester. Since the explanation was quite reasonable, and the cost was generally lower than that of other schools, it was impossible not to pay, so naturally, we had to follow the orders respectfully.

Who knew that this had become a rule? At the beginning of each semester, we were always notified that because the public funds were in arrears, students had to temporarily pay eighty catties of white rice each. Last year, no rice was returned in the first semester. In the second semester, when summer vacation was approaching, the students demanded a refund, causing a stir that became widely known. Only then was permission granted for a refund. However, how much was refunded? It was probably less than seventy or eighty percent of the original amount. What about this semester? I heard that they want to ask the students to donate to the school and will not refund it.

I think that if you want to collect rice for meals, you should clearly and explicitly stipulate how much you want, so that everyone knows it publicly. Those who can afford it will naturally come to study. Now, the students have the name of public-funded students, and after graduation, each person has an obligation to serve for three years, but the rights they enjoy are only partial. Isn't that a case of the name not matching the reality? I don't think the so-called public-funded students abroad are like this.

Therefore, I think that this is entirely a matter of "name" and "reality." Ancient Chinese sages took the issue of name and reality very seriously, but since ancient times, the Chinese nation has always suffered from this major problem of name not matching reality. Even when establishing a theory or starting a business, the motivation and reason are always said to be excellent, but in most cases, there is another purpose. What is said in the mouth is often completely different from what is thought in the heart.

Therefore, I think we still have to emphasize the issue of name and reality. It is best to pursue reality for the sake of name, and it is always good to pursue reality for the sake of name. What is most unacceptable is when the name does not match the reality, or when the name is contrary to the reality. Why do I say that pursuing reality for the sake of name is always good? Think about it: a person who has made a fortune wants to do charity to gain a reputation as a philanthropist. Wouldn't this always be beneficial rather than harmful to the public? As for collecting fees from public-funded students, no matter what new methods are used, I think it will be impossible to come up with an irrefutable reason.

Swimming Island Shi Shi

Swimming Island, also known as River Island, mostly resides behind waterfalls that ordinary birds cannot reach. Their nests are made of fresh moss. Each time they leave or return to their nests, they must cross the waterfall, hence they develop excellent water skills. Their food is small insects in the rapids. When they dive to the bottom of the water to look for food, if they find a target, they immediately spread their wings and "fly" over to catch their prey. Because they do not have webs or fins or other swimming "tools," they cannot swim, but can only vibrate and "fly" in the water, as if in the air.

### The Old Prince's Brush

— He Ku

There was a foreign artist who excitedly ran to a certain art gallery, wanting to buy a painting. He pointed to a painting hanging on the wall and asked the artist what the idea was. The artist said it was "Spring Half-Gnawing Grass". The buyer asked where the grass was. The answer was that it had all been half-eaten. He then asked: "Where's the cow?" The artist's answer was very straightforward: since the grass has been chewed, the cow has probably gone away!

This story fully exposes the ugliness of a group of empty-headed art masters abroad. They may hold an exhibition, but they don't know what they are exhibiting, yet they mark it with high prices. If someone really buys one of their paintings, wouldn't they be taking back a picture of half-eaten green grass, with the cow nowhere to be found? There are many examples of this in the empty calligraphy and painting exhibitions in Shanghai. What is hanging on the wall is equivalent to a blank sheet of paper. When appreciating it, it is the exquisite mounting that is worth admiring.

The paintings of Mr. Fu Xishe, the recluse of West Mountain, are not like this "Spring Cow Gnawing Grass Picture". His landscapes and his own school of coloring have transmitted the soul of art to the paper through the brush. Appreciating Mr. Fu's paintings is like seeing the indifferent and contented state of mind of an old prince on the canvas. What is most representative are a few winter scenes. Even when depicting the bright and beautiful scenery of spring, he never uses gaudy painting techniques to please the public. Instead, he makes your imagination naturally run to a quiet valley, which may have weeping willows in the wind and branches full of red flowers, but cannot hide the lofty spirit of lonely self-appreciation. He needs you to walk into the painting yourself, but he never waves his hand to invite your arrival.

I am completely ignorant of Chinese painting, but I have a special preference for the brushstrokes of the old prince. Looking at his paintings from his background, environment, and the events surrounding him in recent years, it seems that all the grievances have been sublimated from the painting and crystallized into a supreme work of art. From his few lines of inscription, you can capture some of his mood.

Of course, I can only take a cursory glance at the exhibitions. A friend of mine, when he was in Peking, wrote to me on letter paper with the name of Mr. Fu's painting. I still treasure it to this day, partly for friendship and partly for the old prince's brush.

### Painter

— Ruyi

In the 18th century, most American painters made a living by painting portraits for the wealthy. However, those wealthy people never shed their nouveau riche habits. Not only did they like to make their own decisions, but they were also impatient and unwilling to sit still for a month or twenty days for the painters to paint. So the painters came up with a solution. They painted figures in various poses and wearing various luxurious clothes, leaving only the face blank. Customers only needed to choose a picture, and the painters would quickly paint their faces on it. As a result, everyone was happy, and the painters made a fortune.

But the Russian painters of the Middle Ages were different. Although some of them painted portraits, most of them focused on painting "divine" images. In order to make the "spirit" of the paintings more vivid, they often first drew a beautifully posed skull on the paper or cloth, then added various fleshly organs to the skull, and then added clothes and hats. Therefore, whenever the color of the clothes in the painting peeled off, you could see the flesh or even the white bones underneath. It is said that this is how each painting can have its own personality.

### On Zeng Guofan

— Binzhi

From a national standpoint, Zeng Guofan should indeed be called a "sinner," but putting that aside, and looking at his life and career alone, he had a very adaptable spirit and methods.

When the Taiping Army rose up, it was the darkest period of Qing dynasty politics. The reason why the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was able to occupy as many as seventeen provinces and last for fifteen years was largely due to the cultivation of corrupt officials. Zeng made efforts to rectify the bureaucracy while militarily contending with the Taiping Army. He was clean and diligent himself, and had the determination, ability, and methods to rectify the bureaucracy, so that the bureaucracy was completely renewed, and the military was able to progress smoothly. Zeng's methods of governing officials were divided into four categories: selecting officials, observing officials, training officials, and caring for officials. Observing officials and training officials were even more important. He strictly examined and assessed incumbent officials, and rewards and punishments were clearly defined, which boosted morale. He formulated four articles of exhortation for prefects and magistrates, and four articles of exhortation for committee members, all of which were good ways to train officials. He exhorted prefects and magistrates to govern the yamen well, clarify the laws, attach importance to agriculture, and advocate frugality. He exhorted committee members to be diligent, frugal, and studious, and to avoid arrogance. These were all to the point of the abuses of ordinary officials at the time.

Zeng not only advocated governing officials and did his best to seek out talent and appoint them regardless of seniority, but also made great efforts to cultivate them, turning the untalented into the talented, and the less talented into the more talented. As a result, talent emerged and became a trend. His method was "to greatly reward talent, sparing no effort" and "to treat each other sincerely and employ them according to their abilities." These sixteen characters can encompass everything.

Zeng's cultivation of talent started with the word "diligence". Throughout his life, Zeng took the lead in diligence with his subordinates, frugality with himself, not fearing difficulties, not taking shortcuts, giving credit to others, and taking labor for himself. He used this spirit to govern the army, which was able to boost morale; he used it to rectify the bureaucracy, which was able to refresh the political situation. How could he not succeed!

On the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom side, there were Li Xiucheng, Chen Yucheng, Shi Dakai, and others. Their wisdom, courage, and talent were not inferior to Zeng. The reason Zeng was able to succeed was precisely because of these methods. He took the military as the center and politics as the auxiliary, and continued to develop by cultivating talent. The force that drove this method was his tenacious and resolute spirit.

### A Quarrel in the Bedroom Between Husband and Wife Resulted in Being Detained and Spanked on the Palm. Sichuan Reader Asks if It Constitutes Police Misconduct.

Editor Han:

Your publication is the voice of the people, the mirror of society, and the mentor who upholds justice for the people. Although we are still in Sichuan, we have long known this deeply. Now is the era of the democratic torrent and the extension of civil rights. Every corner of China should be filled with light, justice, and reason. However, on the contrary, in a corner of eastern Sichuan—Wushan—I have suffered the extremely dark humiliation of power.

This incident occurred on the morning of November 1st. My wife and I were disciplining our children in the room. Due to a sudden difference of opinion, a quarrel broke out. After the neighbors mediated, the quarrel ended. Because my residence is not far from the police station, the chief of the station, Li Guozhi, was out on the street and learned about it from the people around him. He immediately sent several soldiers to detain my wife and me in the station. Without asking for the reason or details, he said that we were causing trouble for no reason and disrupting social order, and wanted to beat each of our buttocks with forty military sticks. Later, after the police officer Zhu Hanchen repeatedly dissuaded him, he changed the punishment to twenty military sticks on each of our palms. I was extremely angry after suffering this humiliation. I don't know if a quarrel in the bedroom between my wife and me constitutes a crime under the law. Please answer this question in your newspaper. Respectfully, Feng Weizhou

[Answer from the General Administration of Police of the Ministry of the Interior] "An investigation reveals that a quarrel in the bedroom between a husband and wife, which was stopped by others, cannot legally constitute disrupting social order. Furthermore, the police law does not stipulate corporal punishment. The actions of Li Guozhi, the chief of the Wushan County Police Station, if true, are naturally illegal. If the person being punished is dissatisfied with the punishment imposed, he may file a complaint with a higher authority in accordance with Article 46 of the Law on Arrest and Punishment by the Police."

(Editor's Note) Article 46 of the Punishment Law stipulates: "Those who are dissatisfied with the decision of the police authority regarding a police matter may file a complaint with its higher authority within five days from the day after receiving the decision." Mr. Feng has suffered this improper punishment, and the statutory time limit for filing a complaint has passed, I am afraid that there is nothing he can do!

### Telecommunications Q&A

Answered by Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

[Song Kemin from Tianjin Road asks] The transfer telegrams sent to Hankou sometimes have delivery receipts and sometimes do not. I don't know what the reason is? How many hours does it take for express telegrams and special express telegrams sent to Hankou to arrive? (Answer) The time limit for special express telegrams is one hour and thirty minutes. The fact that the special express telegrams sent to Hankou sometimes have them and sometimes do not is because sometimes there are machine line obstacles or the special express telegrams are congested, and they cannot arrive within the specified time limit for a while. In order to avoid delays, it is necessary to restrict receipt according to the situation. As for express telegrams between Shanghai and Hankou, they can arrive on average in about four hours.

[Yuan Xicai from Changchun Road asks] I heard that your newspaper has a method of replacing addresses with telephone numbers to simplify telegram procedures. I don't know what the nature of it is? (Answer) The function of replacing addresses with telephone numbers is the same as replacing addresses with telegram registration numbers. The format for sending a telegram is to first write the "toll payment" character, and then in order (telephone number) (recipient's name) (text of the telegram). After receiving the telegram, the receiving bureau will immediately transmit it to the recipient by telephone. The (original telegram) will be delivered by a special messenger within a few hours after the telephone notification.
