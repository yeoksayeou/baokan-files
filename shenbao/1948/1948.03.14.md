### Participatory Government Committee Requests the Government to Stabilize Grain Prices to Maintain People's Food Supply; Urges the Soviet Union to Expedite the Return of Lushun and Dalian

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Standing Committee of the Participatory Government held a routine meeting at 9:00 AM on the 13th, chaired by Mo Dehui. After the Secretariat's report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a written report, roughly divided into three points: A, Responding to Outer Mongolia's recent protests. B, Recognizing the new government of Siam. C, Establishing a temporary passport issuing agency in Xiamen to facilitate the return of overseas Chinese to their original residences. Subsequently, Xue Dupi, Minister of Water Resources, reported on the recent administrative measures for water conservancy for about an hour. The report was divided into four parts: A, Treatment of the Yellow River. B, Construction of farmland water conservancy and irrigation projects. C, Strengthening basic work. D, Water Law. Then Xue Mingjian, Wu Chunwu, and others raised questions. After Mr. Xue answered, Zhang Binci and Tian Yushi from the Northeast Petition Delegation reported on the situation in the Northeast and the results of their petition. Regarding the current situation in the Northeast, Zhang and others believed that the factors leading to the critical situation lay in the failure of several stages of takeover in the past; such as the initial diplomatic takeover, which resulted in the Northeast's resources being plundered by the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the political takeover also failed. Currently, the military takeover is also failing, because the strategy adopted is to defend strongholds to the death, thus "only knowing how to defend the city, but not clearing the fields," and being defeated by bandits one by one, resulting in the current situation. Therefore, in the future, the greatest determination and the greatest military force must be used to reverse this critical situation. Tian Yushi also proposed that the decision-making regarding the current situation in the Northeast should focus on "seizing time and grasping space." He said that after the petition delegation arrived in Nanjing, the petitions to the Chairman and relevant ministries and commissions regarding the Northeast issue had yielded good results, but it was still hoped that the Participatory Government could continue to supervise and urge the government to implement the promises made to the delegation as soon as possible. After the report, Jiang Yong, Mo Dehui, and others stood up to speak, expressing the Participatory Government's concern for the Northeast issue. Finally, the following proposals were discussed: (1) To stabilize grain prices to maintain the people's food supply and ensure public security, it was resolved to pass it and send it to the government for adoption and implementation. (2) To request the government to urge the Soviet Union to expedite the return of Lushun and Dalian, and if necessary, to appeal to the United Nations, it was resolved to pass it and send it to the government for prompt action. (3) To request exemption from advance payment of income tax to alleviate the industrial and commercial crisis, it was resolved to submit it for review. (4) To step up the absorption of overseas Chinese capital to improve the economic crisis, it was resolved to submit it for review. The meeting adjourned at about 1:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Wang Huayi, a representative of the Northeast Petition Delegation and a current member of the Standing Committee of the Participatory Government, proposed a proposal on strengthening diplomacy with the Soviet Union at the Standing Committee meeting on the 13th. The proposal stated: "Please request the government to urge the Soviet Union to expedite the return of Lushun and Dalian, and if necessary, appeal to the United Nations." After heated discussions, it was resolved to send it to the government for prompt action. The reason for submitting the proposal was still to accuse the Soviet Union of failing to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty. In order to maintain our country's sovereignty and international peace, we should immediately submit a request to the United Nations General Assembly to demand that the Soviet Union immediately return Lushun and Dalian to our country, compensate our country for the lost materials, and stop supporting the Chinese Communist Party. The cosigners of the proposal also included Pan Chaoying, Wu Chunwu, Wang Junying, and Li Qia. In addition, Wang Huayi's proposal "Please request the government to quickly strengthen the Northeast Defense War," which was submitted to the National Government during the last meeting of the Standing Committee, has been sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense for prompt review and handling.

### The Participatory Government will Conclude at the End of the Month; A Solemn and Simple Tea Party will be Held on the 28th; Chairman Chiang is Urged to Attend and Give Instructions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The National Participatory Government will announce its conclusion before the convocation of the Constitutional National Assembly (i.e., the 28th of this month).

This is indeed an important page in our political history, so this tea party will be a gathering of great significance. It is also learned that the Participatory Government will hold another meeting of the Standing Committee on the 26th before the conclusion. At the Standing Committee meeting on the 13th, several members of the Participatory Government agreed that in view of the current critical situation, in order to understand the actual political, economic, and military situation, Premier Zhang should be invited to attend and report. It was decided that Secretary-General Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen would urge him to attend. However, Mr. Zhang has recently been unwell, and if he cannot attend, the meeting may be suspended.

### Xue Dupi Answers Questions at the Participatory Government Meeting

The Ministry of Water Resources Did Not Receive a Report from Feng Yuxiang

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] At the Standing Committee meeting, Participatory Government member Wu Chunwu asked Minister of Water Resources Xue Dupi: "Feng Yuxiang went abroad, reportedly in the name of inspecting water conservancy. I don't know if the Ministry of Water Resources has received a report from Mr. Feng. It is rumored that Mr. Feng used a certain amount of foreign exchange. Does the Ministry of Water Resources know anything about it?" Mr. Xue replied: "Mr. Feng went abroad under the direct appointment of Chairman Chiang of the National Government, not dispatched by the Ministry of Water Resources. I have heard that there is a report, but because it was not dispatched by the Ministry of Water Resources, even if there is a report, it should be directly reported to the Chairman."

### The Fourth Batch of American Relief Rice will Arrive in Shanghai Successively

[United States Information Service, Shanghai] The China Relief Mission announced today that another batch of relief rice supplied to China under the American Relief Plan, carried by the "China Victory" ship, is scheduled to depart from San Francisco on the 13th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on April 2, totaling 1,098 long tons. This is the fourth batch of American relief rice shipped this month. The previous three batches were the "President Jefferson," carrying 415 long tons of rice, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on March 22, the "Luxembourg Victory," carrying 2,174 tons of rice, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on March 26, and the "Clovis Victory," carrying 3,000 tons of rice, scheduled to arrive on March 30.

[Another Message] Officials of the China Relief Mission in Shanghai announced that the Chinese translation of "American Aid," "美援" (Měi Yuán), has been used by the China Relief Mission of the U.S. Department of State as a slogan to explain the source and purpose of the US$45 million relief fund for China in the American foreign relief program. Officials of the China Relief Mission explained: "The American foreign relief program is often confused with the institutions that undertake the work after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Relief Undertaking Custody Committee, various agencies of the United Nations, and many private relief agencies working in China. Although we are assisting in completing some unfinished projects of UNRRA and extracting funds from the proceeds of the sale of American surplus materials as economic assistance to some volunteer relief agencies in China, we hope that all Chinese people can understand that the current US$45 million relief program is purely donated by the United States to help China overcome its current difficulties." The official continued: "A slogan with the words "美援" (Měi Yuán) printed under the American flag will soon be posted in rice stores in Shanghai and other cities where American relief rice is distributed. In the future, each batch of grain, seeds, pesticides, and medical supplies will be marked with these two simple Chinese characters."

### Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement; Decides to Submit Suggestions to the State Council on the Proposal to Authorize the Executive Yuan to Adjust Tax Revenue in a Timely Manner

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Legislative Yuan held its 348th meeting on the 13th, chaired by Sun Ke, President of the Yuan. Before the meeting, all members stood up to mourn the late member Ye Qiuyuan. At 9:30 AM, the heads of government began to report on the sources of aid after the victory and its use (contents published on page 2). Premier Zhang was unable to attend due to illness and was replaced by Yu Hongjun, Zheng Jiemin, Ling Hongxun, Zhang Jiaao, Huo Binshu, Wu Zhaohong, Dong Xian and others to report. In the afternoon, a secret meeting was held, and Deputy Minister Zheng Jiemin reported on the use of US aid by the Ministry of National Defense. It is learned that the difference between the US and China in the calculation of leased materials is more than 500 million US dollars. The US calculates based on the price of leased materials, while we estimate based on the price of surplus materials. The leased materials are priced by an agency, while the surplus materials are calculated at 1% to 8% of the original price, so the result is very different. Ambassador Gu is currently inquiring about the difference in the United States. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM and continued at 2:30 PM, reviewing and passing (1) the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement, (2) the Regulations on Rewards and Punishments for Local Administrative Leaders in the Riot Suppression Period for Preventing Bandits and Protecting (3) the Territory, and (3) the Exchange Tax Regulations (the text of the regulations is published in column 1 on page 2). In addition, it also amended Article 6 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law, amended Article 30 of the Lawyers Law, and passed the Organization Regulations of the Health Black Fever Prevention and Treatment Office and a total of eight types. The draft of the Public Enterprise Trade Union Law was also submitted for discussion. Because Chen Xiaocen reported that An Futing, chairman of the China Labor Association, had sent a telegram with opinions on the case, it was postponed to the next meeting (scheduled for the 16th) for discussion.

In addition, at today's meeting of the Legislative Yuan, the members believed that the matter was of great importance to the National Government's decision by the State Council to "authorize the Executive Yuan to adjust tax revenue in a timely manner during the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion to supplement the national treasury revenue, and still directly request the Legislative Yuan to establish a legal procedure within three months" and should first complete the legislative procedure before adjusting tax revenue. It was resolved to hand over the matter to the Finance Committee to formulate suggestions based on this opinion and submit them to the State Council.

### Surplus Materials in China

U.S. Senate Investigation Report

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The U.S. Senate High Investigation Committee was ordered on the 12th to investigate the report that the U.S. Senate Investigation Report on the handling of surplus materials in China was guilty of serious violations of the law. Senator Tobey of New Hampshire, Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that he had handed over all of his documents to this newly established committee, which is chaired by Republican Senator Ferguson. The documents were submitted during the Senate Banking Committee's review of McCabe's appointment as Director of the Federal Reserve. The attack on the handling of surplus materials was led by former Brigadier General Thorson (now a Colonel), who was an assistant to McCabe, Chairman of the Foreign Liquidation Committee. Thorson has been ordered by his superiors to return home from Tokyo. Tobey said that all future questions about McCabe will be limited to matters within his banking qualifications. McCabe is a paper manufacturer from Pennsylvania and was recently appointed Director of the Federal Reserve by Truman. His appointment must be approved by the Senate, and the Banking Committee will resume hearing opinions next week.

### Measures for the Circulation and Exchange of Northeast Circulation Coupons; Formulated and Implemented by the Ministry of Finance Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance said: "The Northeast was originally a surplus area. At the beginning of the recovery, local prices, interest rates, and wages were lower than those in the customs area. In order to stabilize the local economy and protect the welfare of the people in the Northeast, the government issued Northeast Circulation Coupons to meet local needs. After the circulation of the coupons, most of the prices in the Northeast were lower than those in the customs area, and production industries gradually recovered. The circulation coupons not only maintained the regular official exchange rate, but sometimes the market price actually exceeded the official exchange rate, and the economic situation was gradually developing. However, since the Communist bandits invaded, transportation and production industries in the Northeast have been repeatedly destroyed, and prices have soared, which was not expected. Now, in order to maintain currency confidence and stabilize the economy of the Northeast, and at the same time take into account the economic and financial situation within the customs, the government has made appropriate changes to the original measures and formulated measures for the circulation and exchange of Northeast Circulation Coupons, which will be implemented today to improve the credit of Northeast Circulation Coupons and enhance the strength of suppressing the rebellion. The measures are as follows: (1) The area of circulation of Northeast Circulation Coupons is still limited to the nine provinces of the Northeast; (2) The exchange rate between Northeast Circulation Coupons and Legal Tender is set at one yuan of Circulation Coupons for ten yuan of Legal Tender; (3) From the date of promulgation of these measures, Legal Tender is allowed to be used in the nine provinces of the Northeast and exchanged with Circulation Coupons according to the exchange rate; (4) Passengers entering the customs carrying Northeast Circulation Coupons are allowed to exchange Legal Tender for Circulation Coupons at the Central Bank in Shanhaiguan and Beiping. In Shanhaiguan, they should exchange based on their train tickets, and in Beiping, they should exchange based on a copy of their plane tickets. The amount of exchange per person will be formulated by the Central Bank based on the situation and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval; (5) Remittances from the Northeast to the customs area should be appropriately relaxed. The examination and approval measures will be formulated by the Central Bank with reference to current laws and regulations and reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval; (6) These measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation."

### Land Forces Xuzhou Headquarters Chief of Staff Analyzes the Jiangsu-Shandong Battle Situation and Points Out the Bandit Army's Good Strategies

[Special Dispatch from our Xuzhou Bureau on the 12th] Guo Rugui, Chief of Staff of the Xuzhou Headquarters of the Land Forces, met with reporters on the 12th to analyze the recent battle situation in the Jiangsu-Shandong border area. He believes that the aim of the bandit army's harassment in various parts of northern Jiangsu is to create unease in the hearts of the people in Nanjing and Shanghai during the National Assembly. The original main force of the bandit army was the 11th and 12th columns of Chen Yi's troops. Currently, their 2nd column has arrived from Shandong to reinforce them. The 7th column may have a small part participating, but with their current strength, they will definitely not be able to achieve anything. In the Jiaodong area, fierce fighting is taking place in Zhoucun. The real purpose of the bandit army's attack may be to cover their main force crossing the Yellow River northward in order to escape being trapped by the National Army. In the Yellow River flooded area of western Shandong, there are the main forces of the 1st, 4th, and 6th columns of the bandit army. However, after being severely attacked by the National Army, their strength has been greatly weakened and has not yet been fully replenished. In addition, the 3rd and 8th detachments under Chen Yi have been transferred to Xuchang and are under the command of Chen Geng. They are currently joining forces with the Guang and Kong Congzhou bandit troops to invade Luoyang. In total, Chen Yi's troops have 13 detachments, approximately 140,000 men, possessing machine guns and other weapons. Their firepower is only comparable to that of the second-tier National Army. When fighting head-on, they are no match for the National Army's 13 elite divisions. However, their advantage lies in their quick movement and their skill in setting ambushes. The National Army's defeats were all due to marching in obstacle zones and being ambushed by the bandit troops, such as in Biancang in northern Jiangsu, where the bandit army ambushed them seven times in the same location. As for the bandit army's losses, they are the greatest when attacking fortified positions. The Battle of Namma in central and southern Shandong in the 36th year of the Republic [1947] can prove this, because the bandit army's preparations and tactics are both outdated. The bandit army's claims of "approaching the balance of power" are all self-deception, at least within the Guannei [area within the passes, i.e. mainland China]. Outside the Guannei, there are other factors involved. When discussing the strategy for suppressing the rebellion, he said: The bandit army moves quickly, making it difficult to capture its main force. The correct strategy is to chase them out of their base areas and force them into a dead end to annihilate them. In the continuous pursuit, their officers can be demoralized and their soldiers will desert. The small battles in Teng County and other places in central Shandong in the 36th year of the Republic [1947] yielded this result. When the bandit army's 1st and 4th detachments were forced into a dead end in the Yellow River delta area, nearly 10,000 bandits were annihilated and many surrendered. One unit of bandits was chased so urgently that they lost their minds and even took the Jinpu Railway south to northern Jiangsu, where they were captured alive by the National Army. As for clearing out the remnant bandits in the Sui District, it is necessary to establish local armed forces. However, how to establish them still depends on the effective implementation of central government policies.

[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] "Expelling them from important places, forcing them into desperate situations, and putting them in mortal danger are good strategies for suppressing the communist bandits at present." This was stated by Guo Rugui, Chief of Staff of the Xuzhou Headquarters of the Land Forces, when he met with the reporter delegation from Nanjing and Shanghai. Guo believes that this method of suppressing bandits will cause the communist bandits to either be beaten to death or run to death, or starve to death if they cannot run. Guo also predicted that the final outcome of suppressing the bandits will not be the complete annihilation of the communist bandits, but the complete defeat of the communist bandits. As long as the National Army pursues them closely, the communist bandits will have to run quickly. Guo, in his capacity as a government staff member representing the government at the three-man meetings during the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations the year before last, Marshal Marshall once said: The Chinese Communist Party has several hundred thousand cadres who are willing to sacrifice themselves as a main force, and they cannot be insulted. Over the past three years, these communist cadres have disappeared in the life of fleeing under the continuous pursuit of the National Army, and have been replaced by ignorant people who are coerced. Marshal Marshall's estimate of the communist cadres who were willing to sacrifice themselves for communism can only be calculated at 20-30% today. However, the Chinese Communist Party lacks military talent, and cunning people easily obtain opportunities for development. For example, according to the military agreement signed by the three parties at the time, the Chinese Communist Party should produce two general commanders of army groups. The Chinese Communist Party proposed Peng Dehuai and Chen Yi. I (Guo himself) then asked Zhou Enlai: It is reasonable for Peng Dehuai to be the general commander of the army group, but why only mention Chen Yi and not Lin Biao or Liu Bocheng for the other general commander of the army group? Zhou replied: Chen Yi's influence has developed more deeply and he deserves it without any doubt. From this, it can be seen that the Chinese Communist Party only knows how to worship power. Guo then gave a general analysis of Chen Yi's troop strength after the Namma Battle. Chen Yi's current troop strength is claimed to be 13 columns, approximately 150,000 men, with the western Shandong corridor as the base for disrupting the Central Plains. Northern Jiangsu, Jiaodong, and northern Anhui are regarded as supporting battlefields. Chen Yi has exposed two weaknesses since his disastrous defeat in the Namma Battle: First, Chen Yi's so-called counter-offensive is only a reverse without an offensive, and he has no ability to attack fortified positions; second, Chen Yi's specialty of ambushes cannot resist the strong National Army. Chen Yi occasionally boasts that he has reached the stage of comparing strength with the National Army with a small victory, which is self-deception. Guo finally believes that in order to defeat the mass line of the communist bandits, it is necessary to first establish local armed forces and eliminate the communist bandits' village cadres. However, local armed forces should not be controlled by local tyrants and evil gentry, but should be controlled by local heroes who defend their homes and villages.

### Due to Strategic Considerations, the National Army in Northeast China Withdraws from Yongji and Xiaofengman; The Column of Accompanying Civilians Stretches Over Ten Miles

[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] When the National Army withdrew from Jilin, the column of accompanying civilians stretched over fifty miles. The wide and snowy Jichang Highway was filled with these "people who do not want to be slaves." According to eyewitness estimates, the total number was no less than 100,000, almost half of the population of Jilin City. They were intercepted by the bandit army several times during the march, and more than 20,000 people were separated from the National Army's covering troops due to their late departure, resulting in them being blocked by bandit cavalry. In the past two days, more than 50,000 Jilin refugees who have been regarded as righteous people have entered the Changchun urban area one after another. The municipal government has set up multiple reception centers to properly comfort and accommodate them. Because Qingdao and Changchun are close to each other, most of the righteous people have relatives and friends to rely on. According to investigations and statistics by the authorities, as of noon today, the number of orphaned and helpless people who rely solely on relief for survival has not exceeded 300.

[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] Due to strategic considerations, the National Army has now voluntarily withdrawn from Yongji, the location of the Jilin provincial government, and Xiaofengman, the electric capital. Personnel and family members from various agencies and bureaus of the Qing Province provincial government have also withdrawn with the army. The National Army began its actions at 2:00 AM on the 9th and had completely reached its designated area by the 11th. Although it encountered bandit attacks several times along the way, it quickly overcame them. When the National Army began to withdraw, although it was late at night, thousands of citizens immersed in sleep were quickly awakened by the extraordinary barking of dogs. After realizing the National Army's intentions, they immediately supported the old and carried the young, and automatically joined the National Army's column, requesting to go together. Within a few hours, hundreds of thousands of people gathered, and the National Army provided proper cover to safely evacuate them from the dangerous situation. However, they were repeatedly attacked by the bandit forces along the way, and civilians suffered slight casualties, and some were scattered. Furthermore, when the National Army withdrew from Xiaofengman, in order to take into account the safety of the lives and property of tens of thousands of people along the Songhua River and the difficulty of national production and construction, it only slightly dismantled the machinery of the power plant so that the bandit forces could not utilize it in the short term. However, the Songhua River dam, which was built over several years with the hard work of hundreds of thousands of people, was preserved and not destroyed in the slightest. At the same time, the ammunition piled up in warehouses and civilian houses near Yongqing Railway Station was not destroyed because such destruction would inevitably cause a huge explosion and turn the entire city of Yongji into ashes.

[Special Dispatch from our Beiping Bureau on the 13th] Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Director of the Northeast Headquarters, has recently been appointed as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Northeast and Commander of the First Army Corps, stationed in Changchun. The matter of Zheng concurrently serving as the Chairman of Jilin Province is still under discussion. It is said that Zheng will take office after going to Changchun again. Furthermore, a certain unit of the National Army has arrived safely in Changchun from Qinglin. Zheng, along with Army Commander Zeng Zesheng, inspected the garrison locations and extended his condolences.

The Defenders of Siping Complete Their Mission

[Special Dispatch from our Luoyang Bureau on the 13th] The National Army in Siping fought hard for ten days and accomplished the mission of annihilating the bandits. The bandits suffered more than 10,000 casualties, and the National Army also suffered heavy casualties. On the 12th, the bandits broke in from both the northeast and engaged in a melee. The defending troops telegraphed that the bandit artillery fire was fierce and requested air force assistance at night. As of the 13th, the fighting was still ongoing. It has been found that large numbers of Japanese prisoners of war and Korean bandits participated in both defensive battles of Siping. The bandit artillery fire was fierce, and they attacked with small tanks.

[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] Fierce street fighting has broken out in Siping, the granary of Liaobei. At noon on the 13th, under the cover of tanks, the bandits fiercely attacked the city. A large number of Japanese prisoners of war and Korean communists were found among the bandits, and they engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops, especially in the eastern suburbs of the city. Later, a unit of bandits broke through our defenses and invaded the eastern part of the city. Both sides then engaged in a heroic street fight. Our defending troops firmly defended their core strongholds and fought bravely. At night, the bandits continued to attack the city from the northern suburbs. They were attacked by our ground and air forces, and the fighting is still ongoing.

### The Lesson of Czechoslovakia

— Cheng Tianfang

The coup in Czechoslovakia on February 25th and the suicide of Czech Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk on March 9th should provide a profound lesson for the Chinese people and people all over the world!

Czechoslovakia was an independent country that emerged from World War I. Its area is only more than 49,300 square miles, and its population is 14,720,000 (statistics from 1934), which is really just a small country. However, it is highly regarded among the countries of the world, not only because it occupies a strategically important position in European geography, but also because it is one of the most enlightened and progressive countries in Eastern Europe. Among the countries of Eastern Europe, only Czechoslovakia can be said to have truly implemented democratic politics, and its constitutional achievements are no less than those of the Netherlands and Belgium. Czechoslovakia's education, transportation, and economy are very developed, and therefore, the knowledge and living standards of the Czech people are higher than those of any other country in Eastern Europe. The capital, Prague, has a very famous university. Czech agriculture and industry are evenly developed, with the number of people engaged in industry and agriculture accounting for 35% of the total population. Czechoslovakia's area is smaller than that of Anhui Province, yet before the war, it had 15,500 kilometers of railway (80% of which was state-owned), 69,700 kilometers of highway, and 125,000 automobiles. Czechoslovakia's sugar, beer, smoked meat, leather shoes, and glassware are famous throughout the world. Coal and iron are quite abundant. In 1937, it produced 1.67 million tons of iron and 2.31 million tons of steel, most of which was exported. Timber, leather, cotton textiles, wool textiles, and hemp textiles are also sold in large quantities abroad. In 1927, Czechoslovakia's total import value was 10.981 billion crowns (equivalent to more than US$332 million), and its total export value was 11.982 billion crowns (equivalent to more than US$363 million). The government's finances were also very balanced and sound, with a surplus every year and no deficit in the budget. In 1937, the revenue was 8.456 billion crowns and the expenditure was 8.454 billion crowns (both equivalent to more than US$256 million).

Czechoslovakia was not only rich but also strong militarily. Since its founding, the government has attached great importance to national defense. In 1918, the Czechoslovak Republic was established, and the following year, it hired French military advisers to train the army and adopted a conscription system, requiring 20-year-old men to serve in the military. The military advisory group served for ten years, greatly improving the efficiency of the Czech military and making the Czech army one of the best-trained and equipped forces in Europe. Czechoslovakia's arms industry is very famous in the world, and the products of the Skoda factory are no less than those of the German Krupp factory. The machine guns and rifles used by our country in the early days of the War of Resistance were manufactured by the Skoda factory.

A country like Czechoslovakia can be considered to have achieved remarkable achievements in both civil administration and military preparedness. Everything was thriving. In 1936 and 1938, I visited the Czech capital twice and visited the Skoda factory and Carlsbad hot springs. I personally saw the neatness and cleanliness of its cities and villages, the grandeur of its public buildings, the industriousness and intelligence of its people, and the progress and excellence of its craftsmanship, all of which were comparable to Western Europe without any inferiority. Czech society was full of a spirit of vigor and progress, and there was absolutely no phenomenon of corruption and degeneration. However, this country, because it is located between the two great powers of the Soviet Union and Germany, and because it had internal traitors, has suffered external aggression and has twice suffered a tragic fate in the last ten years. The first time was in 1938 and 1939 when it was annexed by Germany, and the second time was this coup.

Czechoslovakia's ability to build a nation was largely due to Thomas G. Masarik (the father of the foreign minister who committed suicide). This founding hero was one of the great statesmen of the 20th century. Because of his extensive knowledge, great personality, and lifelong struggle for freedom, democracy, and the liberation of the Czech nation, he gained the sympathy of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. Therefore, in October 1918, when Germany was about to fail, the Czechoslovak Republic was formally born and immediately recognized by the great powers. Thomas Masarik was elected as the first president, and only resigned at the end of 1935 due to old age (he was 86 years old at the time). Eduard Benesh (the current president) succeeded him.

Masarik served for a full 17 years, laying the foundation for democracy and prosperity in Czechoslovakia, and at the same time, he made every effort to ensure the country's security in diplomacy. At that time, Czechoslovakia was most afraid of Germany's resurgence, which would become a threat to Czechoslovakia again. Therefore, it signed an alliance with France and formed the Little Entente with Romania and Yugoslavia. After Hitler came to power, it signed a defensive alliance with the Soviet Union in 1935. In the eyes of the Czechs, with the two great powers of France and the Soviet Union as allies, they should be as stable as a rock. But no one knew that things in the world often turn out unexpectedly. The 3.3 million Germans in the Czech population were scattered in the Sudetenland bordering Germany and Austria. After Germany became strong, it used these Sudeten Germans to create disputes within Czechoslovakia, disrupt order, and demand separation from Czechoslovakia. Hitler further used the pretext of protecting the Germans to occupy the Sudetenland. The situation became tense in 1938. The Soviet Union stood by, while France and Britain adopted a policy of compromise toward Germany. The Munich Conference recognized Hitler's demands and ceded the Sudetenland to Germany. In addition, it ceded a large piece of land to Hungary and a small piece of land to Poland. Czechoslovakia lost 30% of its land and one-third of its population in total. Since its two allies had abandoned Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia had no choice but to painfully accept these conditions, and Benesh resigned as a result. In March 1939, Hitler tore up the Munich Agreement and occupied the entire territory of Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was completely destroyed!

Czechoslovakia was under German occupation for more than six years. In February 1945, the German army retreated, and Czechoslovakia celebrated its rebirth, and Benesh resumed his presidency. The Czech government has always pursued a policy of good neighborliness, especially with the Soviet Union, the elder brother of the Slavic nations, and has strived for friendship. It had already concluded a defensive alliance before the war. This time, the liberation depended on the military strength of the Soviet Union, so it naturally spared no expense to seek the favor of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union demanded the cession of the Ruthenia region, and the Czech government immediately agreed. It also signed treaties of mutual assistance and economic treaties with the Soviet Union, incorporating Czechoslovakia into the Soviet sphere of influence. In July 1946, the cabinet was reorganized, and Benesh appointed Klement Gottwald, a member of the Communist Party, as prime minister. The Communist Party held nine of the 26 cabinet seats. It was nominally a five-party coalition cabinet, but in reality, the Communist Party had the greatest power. Benesh believed that this approach would please his powerful neighbor. But no one knew that the ambitions of an invading country have no limits. Although Czechoslovakia made such concessions, the Soviet Union still felt that Czechoslovakia's independence and democratic spirit were too strong compared to Yugoslavia, Romania, and other countries, and it was not enough to be a loyal vassal state. In particular, last August, the Czech government, under the leadership of Benesh, surprisingly announced that it would participate in the Paris Conference responding to the Marshall Plan, which angered the Kremlin even more. So, a long-distance telephone call from Moscow forced Czechoslovakia to announce its cancellation of its decision to participate in the Paris Conference. This act of slapping itself in the face is intolerable for any independent country, but Czechoslovakia actually endured it. But the Kremlin still did not forgive it, so it launched this coup, which made the government's power exclusively held by the Communist Party. From now on, it can naturally completely obey Moscow's orders. So-called independence and so-called democracy have become nominal! No one knows whether Benesh's actions are free now. Jan Masaryk was heartbroken and disappointed, and had no choice but to commit suicide. They, father and son, devoted their lives to the country and the nation, and encountered such an ending, which really makes people all over the world who love freedom and democracy feel infinite sympathy and infinite grief.

We not only grieve for Czechoslovakia, but we also need to reflect on China's situation. The Czech communists colluded with external forces to stage a coup, and the Chinese Communist Party is also colluding with external forces to make war. Some people in the United States (including General Marshall) still believe that the reason why the China problem is so serious and the Chinese people are so suffering is due to the suppression of the communists by military force, and the suppression of the communists by military force occurred because the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were not implemented, including the failure to form a coalition government that included the Communist Party. As for why the resolutions were not implemented and why the coalition government could not be formed, "both sides" (the government and the Communist Party) were at fault (see Marshall's remarks to reporters on the 10th of this month). On this point, we cannot help but sigh that General Marshall and Americans who hold the same views are too naive! The Communist Party of any country in the world is an extremely exclusive party with the strongest degree of exclusion, and it will never allow the existence of other political parties, let alone cooperate with other political parties to shoulder political responsibility. The reason why the Communist Parties of Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and China emphasized coalition governments after the war was entirely a means or a step for them to seize power. Before the Communist Party's strength was sufficient and its preparations were complete, it used the guise of "democratic politics" to demand that it form a government with other parties. Once it had a foothold in the government, it tore off its "democratic" mask when it believed that the opportunity had arrived, and excluded other parties, slaughtered dissidents, and embarked on the road of dictatorship. Since the summer of 1946, the political unrest that has occurred in Eastern European countries such as Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Poland has fully demonstrated this principle. The Czech incident has added another strong piece of evidence. Under five consecutive similar incidents, some people still believe that the Chinese Communist Party sincerely wanted to form a coalition government with other political parties in China in the Political Consultative Conference. That is either wishful thinking or self-deception. For the sake of China and the sake of the world, fortunately, the coalition government that included the Chinese Communist Party was not realized at that time, and the Chinese government now has the determination and strength to resist the aggression of the international Communist Party. If there had been such a coalition government two years ago, I am afraid that a coup similar to the one in Czechoslovakia would have occurred in China long ago, and China would have already fallen into the sphere of influence of international communism!

Under the leadership of Moscow, international communism continues to develop in Asia and Europe. This development is organized and planned, with unified orders and orderly steps, just like the battle plan of a large military operation. On the other hand, the countries that love freedom and democracy and oppose communism have divergent ideas, slow actions, scattered forces, and even the attitude of getting by as long as the fire has not reached their eyebrows. Like many people in Britain and the United States, they oppose communism on the one hand, and on the other hand, they believe that the trouble caused by the Chinese Communist Party is China's own problem, and other countries can stand by and do nothing. If this continues, communism can defeat the democratic countries of the world one by one and achieve its ambition of dominating the world. The ancients said: "It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost." Czechoslovakia is gone. If the people of the democratic countries of the world do not want their own countries to become the second Czechoslovakia, then they must quickly wake up, quickly unite and fight to resist the offensive of communism in order to save the world from disaster; otherwise, they will regret it one day.

### Yu Hongjun Reports to the Legislative Yuan on Various US Loans and Their Uses

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 13th] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun reported to the Legislative Yuan on the 13th on the various US loans to China after the victory and their uses. The contents are as follows:

The US loans to China after the victory can be divided into four categories according to their nature and source:

A. Post-war loans for materials. According to the procurement plans of various agencies, the Pre-War US Materials Supply Committee negotiated with the US side. These loans are all credit loans, and the government repays the principal and interest on a regular basis in accordance with the agreement. Zi. US Export-Import Bank Loans: (1) US$33 million for cotton loans, of which US$32.976 million has been used by the end of this month; (2) US$16.65 million for railway loans, of which US$15.2 million has been received by January this year; (3) US$8.8 million for power plant loans, of which US$3.9 million has been used by the end of this month; (4) US$2.6 million for ship purchase loans, for the purchase of 16 ships, of which US$2.45 million has been used; (5) US$1.5 million for coal mining equipment loans, of which US$825,000 has been used; (6) US$16 million for Yongli Chemical Company loans, guaranteed by the government; (7) US$42 million for ship loans, not yet used due to the difficulty of purchasing ships. The total of the above seven loans is US$82.75 million. Except for items 6 and 7, the government can use US$62.55 million. Chou. US Government Loans: (1) US$58.5 million in loans for materials borrowed under the Lend-Lease Act, of which US$50.17 million has been used by the end of last year; (2) US$16.5 million in loans from the Shipping Administration Bureau for the purchase of ships, of which US$6.94 million has been used. The total amount of post-war loan materials is US$149.442 million.

B. Most of the post-war Lend-Lease materials are for military use and are directly handled by the Ministry of National Defense. The US State Department's bill sent by our Ambassador to the United States, Gu, lists a total of US$747.28 million, including (1) US$111.742 million for military fire; (2) US$35.62 million for aircraft; (3) US$99.99 million for tanks; (4) US$32.8 million for ships; (5) US$55.81 million for military equipment; (6) US$36,000 for production equipment; (7) US$37 million for agricultural and industrial equipment; (8) US$353.82 million for labor services, totaling US$747.28 million. However, according to the report of the Ministry of National Defense, the post-war Lend-Lease materials should be US$810.113 million based on the calculation of the original inventory at the time of receipt. In addition, the Navy received more than US$24.38 million, totaling more than US$105.4 million, with a difference of more than US$500 million. The reasons are (1) the list provided by the US side is too simple and cannot be verified by both parties; (2) items without certainty in the list amount to more than US$570 million; (3) labor service costs are difficult to verify; (4) it is not known whether other special material items are also mixed in. I have telegraphed Ambassador Gu to inquire about this type of difference.

C. Surplus materials are in the nature of debt repayment and are handled by the Materials Supply Bureau. There are three items: (1) The Western China Region, signed by former President Song and the US side in November 1945, mainly consists of aviation materials, which were received by the former Aviation Commission. The initial valuation by the US side was US$673.731 million and 5.16 billion in legal tender. At the time of receipt, it was more than US$57.369 million and more than 9.27 billion in legal tender, of which the legal tender item was offset by our advance payment for the US side (construction of rear airports, etc.); (2) The Navy's purchase of the original agreement did not specify the total amount, stipulating that Jiangnan Shipyard would go to various islands in the Pacific to purchase, and Jiangnan Shipyard would repair ships for the US side as compensation; (3) The Pacific Region was signed by former President Song and the US side in August 1946, including US$500 million in mobile materials and US$84 million in fixed equipment in China. The US side also provided US$30 million for transportation costs. Except for the US$74 million in materials that should be paid before signing the agreement, the remaining was offset by the legal tender of US$130 billion advanced by us during the US military's stationing in China. US$55 million is still owed, with US$35 million used for the US side to purchase houses in China, and another US$20 million used as the US Educational Foundation in China. The above materials are all received by the Materials Supply Bureau. By the end of February, more than US$278 million has been received, and US$175 million has been shipped to our country. All materials must be shipped to our country before the end of June. Of these materials, 70% will be allocated to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of National Defense, and 30% will be auctioned off and handed over to the national treasury.

D. Post-disaster relief materials. The Administrative Relief and Rehabilitation Administration received more than US$535 million in relief materials and US$122.25 million in ocean freight, totaling US$647.5 million, of which the US contribution accounted for 72%, totaling more than US$460 million, which was handled by the Administrative Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

### The Center of Western European Diplomacy Moves to Paris, Sixteen-Nation Conference Opens Tomorrow, The United States and Recipient Countries Discuss the Transportation of Materials

[French News Agency Paris, 13th] After the adjournment of the Five-Nation Conference, the center of diplomatic activity has shifted from Ruhr to Paris. The Sixteen-Nation Conference will be held here tomorrow. At least fourteen foreign ministers will attend the conference. Observers say that the main task of the conference is to discuss the reconstruction of European countries, but this is also the best opportunity for national politicians to discuss issues outside the agenda. First, opinions on European economic recovery will be taken. This report can be regarded as a "general outline" of various achievements in mutual assistance and cooperation. Then, the reports of the US and European resources and production groups will be reviewed. It is reported that the report from the US side is generally the same as that made by the technical committee last fall. At the same time, a "Standing Committee" will be established, including representatives from the sixteen countries or perhaps one representative from West Germany. This committee is the successor to the European Cooperation Committee last fall, and its task is to establish a permanent institution to implement the Marshall Plan. Opinions differ widely on the powers of this permanent institution. Some parties say that if this institution is only given advisory powers, it will not be able to complete its tasks smoothly. Other countries say that this institution does not need to have the power to allocate goods, as this will infringe on the sovereignty of the countries concerned. However, goodwill and cooperation are "indispensable" in order to achieve satisfactory results. In short, it is undeniable that this decision will have a very significant impact on Europe.

[French News Agency Paris, 12th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and Greek Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsaldaris, each leading their respective delegations, will arrive in Paris tomorrow to prepare to attend the Economic Cooperation Conference.

[Central News Agency Washington, 12th] According to a State Department spokesperson today, while Congress has not yet passed the European Recovery Program, representatives of the sixteen countries participating in the program and responsible US officials held informal talks here today to lay the foundation for the European Recovery Program. It is said that the talks are exploratory and aim to determine the types of materials to be imported in order to provide the necessary reports to those who implement the European Recovery Program.

### Talks Between British and Turkish Foreign Ministers Reaffirm Friendship Between the Two Countries; Norway Denies Soviet Request for Treaty Negotiations

[Reuters, London, December 12] Before attending the Sixteen-Nation Conference in Paris, Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak met with British Foreign Secretary Bevin in London today to discuss issues of mutual concern to Britain and Turkey, as well as potential issues arising from the European Recovery Program. A communique issued after the meeting stated that the talks provided an opportunity to further the close friendship between the two countries and governments. Britain and Turkey will continue their past cooperation, based on the 1939 Anglo-Turkish Alliance, to maintain good relations and world peace. The communique also formally reaffirmed the continued validity of the 1939 Anglo-French-Turkish mutual assistance treaty, which was signed after the outbreak of the war and stipulated that if Turkey were to be attacked by a European country and participate in a war in the Mediterranean region, Britain and France would provide assistance to Turkey.

[Agence France-Presse, Oslo, December 12] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange today denied rumors that the Soviet Union had requested negotiations with the Norwegian government to sign a mutual assistance pact.

[Reuters, London, December 12] It is widely rumored here that the Soviet government has requested a mutual assistance treaty with Norway, as it had previously suggested to Finland. Authoritative sources believe these rumors are merely hearsay. The opinion of officials here is that the participation of the French and Italian Communist parties in the Cominform is indicative of the Communist movement's direction. Recent actions by Moscow and Belgrade confirm that the Italian general election, which begins on April 18, is a decisive event within the Communist strategy. While no one in London denies the possibility that the Soviet government may suggest a defensive alliance with Norway at some point, Soviet policy in Europe seems to be limited to consolidating the Soviet sphere of influence east of the boundaries established by last year's Sixteen-Nation Marshall Plan Conference in Paris. The British believe that it would be an extremely serious development if the Soviet government attempted to drag European countries, such as Norway, which have already clearly stated their independent stance, into the Soviet sphere of influence. Coinciding with rumors of Soviet pressure on Norway is the alleged special purpose of Norwegian Defense Minister Hauge's visit to London. Hauge returned to Norway via London from Berlin last weekend. Although it is said that Hauge's visit to London was to discuss the future status of the Norwegian occupation forces in the British zone of Germany with the British War Office and to order British jet fighters, sensitive individuals believe that Hauge's visit to Britain also had other missions.

### Soviet Union Threatens Greece and Turkey; United States Should Take Action; Byrnes Issues Warning

[Reuters, Charleston, South Carolina, December 13] Former Secretary of State Byrnes stated in his hometown of Charleston today that the United States should solemnly warn the Soviet Union that if the independence of Italy, France, Greece, and Turkey is threatened by methods of intimidation, the United States will take action, not merely issue a protest. Byrnes pointed out that when President Truman launched the Truman Doctrine a year ago, he assured the aforementioned countries that if their independence were threatened directly or indirectly by aggressors, the United States would take action.

### Soviet Newspaper Comments on Western European Alliance

[United Press, Moscow, December 12] The newspaper Izvestia today carried an article by "Observer" entitled "The Brussels Anti-European Peace Conspiracy," which claimed that "the Brussels Five-Nation Conference will result in blatant interference by the United States in the international political life of the people of Western Europe. The Soviet Union informed the United States, Britain, and France on the 6th of this month that these countries were turning West Germany into a military base in preparation for aggression against the Soviet Union, and the Brussels Conference is a further step in this policy."

### Dutch Communist Party Plans to Form Action Committees

[Reuters, Amsterdam, December 12] Over 200,000 leaflets were distributed throughout the Netherlands today, urging Dutch Communists to organize "Action Committees" to promote "national welfare" and ordering these committees to send representatives to a mass meeting to be held in Amsterdam on April 4 to "complete cooperation with Eastern Europe and resist the threats from the United States."

### Four Powers Discuss Austrian Peace Treaty; Meeting Achieves Progress

[Reuters, London, December 12] The representatives of the Four Powers on the Austrian issue have adopted a French proposal to compare chapter by chapter the French and Soviet proposals on the definition of German assets in Austria, breaking the procedural deadlock that has persisted for over a week. Today's meeting compared the two countries' proposals on the oil industry of German assets in Austria. On Monday, they will compare proposals on the Danube Shipping Company.

### Funeral Held Under Gloomy Skies, Crowds Line the Streets to Pay Respects; State Funeral for Late Czech Foreign Minister Yesterday; Benes Attends Only Preliminary Ceremony

[United Press, Prague, December 13] The state funeral for the late Foreign Minister Masaryk, organized by the Communist Funeral Committee, was held today under gloomy skies. The hall was set up in the National Museum, and from early morning, countless people gathered in the streets around the museum, the Parliament Building, and the central square. Flower shops sold out of flowers, which were thrown at the gun carriage carrying the hearse as it slowly passed by. Yesterday, from morning to dusk, over 250,000 men and women filed past Masaryk's body to pay their final respects.

[United Press, Prague, December 13] Millions of Czechs gathered in the streets of Prague on the 13th to pay their final respects to Masaryk, with soldiers and police standing guard along the two-mile route of the funeral procession, preventing the crowds from surging forward. Residents along the route had been warned not to open their windows during the procession. Cabinet members, diplomatic missions, and hundreds of thousands of civilians participated in the procession. President Benes, who has remained secluded since the Communist coup, will also leave his rural villa to preside over the funeral. An official announcement stated that the President will attend the preliminary ceremony in the Prague Museum, and Communist Prime Minister Gottwald will represent the President in leading the procession from the museum to the Czernin Palace, the location of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where a brief ceremony will also be held. The hearse will then proceed to the Masaryk family tomb in Lany, which Benes is not expected to attend. Gottwald delivered a funeral eulogy, stating: "What I least expected has happened. Now that this tragic event has occurred, I, as Prime Minister, must deliver a funeral eulogy and accompany our beloved friend to his final resting place. Masaryk and I recently had a cheerful discussion about the bright future of our domestic and foreign policies. He was as optimistic as ever. We also talked about personal matters, including Masaryk's planned recuperation in the mountains after his speech in Parliament. The news of his death was like a bolt from the blue, a terrible blow to me and his friends."

### Taft Asks Reduction of Aid-to-Europe Funds; U.S. Senate Rejects; Legislation Completed Before April

[United Press, Washington, December 13] Republican Senator Taft's proposal to reduce the first year's expenditure of the European Recovery Program to four billion dollars was defeated last night by a vote of 56 to 31. The $5.3 billion aid-to-Europe bill is expected to pass quickly and be put into effect on April 1, but many other amendments remain to be voted on.

The defeat of Taft's amendment appears to be a high point in the opposition to the European Recovery Program. The Senate adjourned late into the night and will continue the meeting on the 13th to make a final vote on the bill.

[United Press, Washington, December 13] Republican leaders Senators Taft and Vandenberg publicly disagreed for the first time last night on whether the aid-to-Europe bill should be limited to one year or four years. Vandenberg stated that the bill is intended to last for four years, but that no Congress can bind the next Congress, and that the continuation of aid should be discussed annually, depending on whether the recipient countries can fulfill their obligations. Taft retorted, "I completely disagree. There is no such obligation. There is no contractual relationship between the recipient countries and us."

### Seventy-One British Parliament Members Request Formation of Western European Federation

[United Press, London, December 13] Seventy-one members of all parties in the British Parliament, except the Communist Party, have jointly proposed a motion calling for immediate action to form a federation between the countries of Western Europe in order to save democracy. This is the first parliamentary attempt in Europe to realize a century-long dream. The British Foreign Office declined to comment on the proposal. The members of Parliament are calling for the establishment of an urgent "revolutionary" long-term policy to organize a Western European economic and political federation. This motion coincides with the conclusion of the Brussels Treaty, but is even more significant than the latter, as it serves as the foundation for Western European unity.

### Spain Requests Improved U.S.-Spanish Relations

[United Press, Madrid, December 12] According to authoritative sources, the Spanish government has informed the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires here that maintaining close relations between the United States and Spain is extremely important for Western civilization, given recent events in Czechoslovakia and Finland.

### Czech Incident Included on Provisional Agenda; Security Council to Discuss on Wednesday; Chile Lodges Complaint Against Soviet Union with United Nations

[United Press, Lake Success, December 12] Chile today requested a United Nations investigation into the Soviet Union's role in the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia. The case has been placed on the provisional agenda for the Security Council on the 17th. After the sudden death of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk, the country's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Papanek, requested an investigation, but it was shelved by UN Secretary-General Lie. Today, the Chilean representative, on the orders of Chilean President Videla, formally lodged a complaint. Chile also accused the Soviet Union of using Hitler's tactics. This is the first time since the Iranian incident two years ago that the Soviet Union has been directly accused before the Security Council. The first step in this test case will be to discuss whether to include it on the formal agenda, which is a procedural matter and not subject to the veto power of the five permanent members. The major Western European powers will again confront the Soviet Union's expansion of power in Europe and elsewhere. Some speculate that the Soviet Union will follow its old tactic of March 1946 and withdraw from the meeting when the Security Council discusses the case.

### Soviet Union Refuses to Discuss Partition of Holy Land with Representatives of Jewish Agency

Security Council to Hear Reports from Four Powers Tomorrow

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, December 12] The Security Council is scheduled to meet next Monday to continue discussing the Palestine issue. On the 5th of this month, the Security Council entrusted the five incumbent members of the council to discuss the situation in Palestine and report back to the full council within ten days.

[United Press, New York, December 12] Soviet representative Gromyko today refused to discuss the Palestine issue with representatives of the Jewish Agency at the Four Power meeting. The Jewish representatives urged the implementation of the partition plan passed by the United Nations General Assembly, but Gromyko sat silently for two hours without saying a word. He also remained silent when the representatives of the United States, China, and France decided to invite representatives from the Arab Higher Committee to attend the meeting on the 14th. Afterwards, Gromyko told reporters that he still believes that negotiations with Arab and Jewish representatives would only increase disputes.

It is expected that Katayama's letter of appointment will be announced soon.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, December 13] A Central News Agency reporter learned today from authoritative sources that the Japanese government has requested the Allied Headquarters and the eleven Allied nations to negotiate a $1 billion line of credit to implement Japan's five-year economic recovery plan. The Japanese government has also requested guarantees that there will be sufficient food imports to feed the Japanese people. According to the Japanese government's plan, if the line of credit is obtained and food imports are guaranteed, the economic level of Japan will be restored to the level of 1930-34 after the completion of the five-year plan. By 1952, Japan will be able to afford to import food for its people at its own expense.

[United Press, Tokyo, December 13] The Allied Council for Japan will hold its 54th meeting on the 17th. The agenda, which was published on Friday, shows that none of the four member countries have submitted formal procedural matters for discussion.

### The British Constitution

— (By L.S. Amery, translated by Pi Fu)

The British political system can be described as a government accountable to Parliament, but it must be remembered that this responsibility is not only to the majority in Parliament or the party organization that produces that majority. The first thing cabinet ministers do after taking office is to be responsible to the King for protecting the interests of the country and the empire. As far as members of Parliament are concerned, they are responsible to the entire Parliament, and at the same time responsible to the people of the whole country, to make Parliament the center of the country's life, responsible for ensuring full and free discussion of every policy, and responsible for supporting the dignity of justice presided over by the Speaker. Beyond these responsibilities, as leading figures in their respective parties, they have a responsibility to develop the characteristics of the party and to promote the interests of the party.

The term "responsibility," however, has two meanings: it not only means being accountable to the authorities on the surface, but also having an independent sense of weighing the importance of things and making decisions at the right time. The approval or disapproval of others can be ignored. The British government is not only responsible to the authority that has appointed it, in the same way that an ordinary manager is responsible to shareholders and bosses, but is an independent group. After taking office, it is responsible for leading the country and Parliament based on its own judgment and beliefs. In every respect, the responsibilities of the opposition party are no less than those of the government and the government's supporters. The opposition party is responsible for criticizing in Parliament, and at the same time must explain its claims so that public opinion believes it is qualified to govern. The combination of responsible leadership on the government's side and responsible criticism on the Parliament's side is the soul of the British constitution. Every era needs to change the external institutions of the constitution, or make partial adjustments to it. This evolution is inevitable, but we must try to preserve its main soul.

We cannot deny that the demands on our constitutional institutions are continuing to increase, and both the government and Parliament tend to be overwhelmed. In a state of physical and mental exhaustion, the blood vessels of the British constitutional system are beginning to feel the pain of high blood pressure. How can we make them withstand the more tense situation in the near future? How can we expand these blood vessels so that they can transport the amount of blood that the heart must supply, so that the body can cope with new tasks? In other words, how can we make parliamentary debate competent? We know that this point is very important for a free political system. It is nothing less than a fortress against dictatorship and autocracy. How do we distribute the work of the mind and body so as not to overwork or waste energy? In other words, how can we, within the framework of the current cabinet system, give appropriate importance and power to the side that designs and plans?

Regarding the latter point, I believe that the time has come to hand over the highest power of the cabinet to a small group of no more than six cabinet members, each of whom is responsible not for the administration of mutually related parts, but for its policy. I must remind readers that a similar system was successfully tested during the First World War in the war cabinet, and the current government seems to be moving in this direction, at least in terms of defense and economic policies.

Regarding the question of how Parliament can cope with its work, many people have offered opinions. Here, I can only point out the importance of these opinions, and I do not intend to discuss their content further. Whether some of Parliament's work can be transferred to provincial governments, or legislative bodies similar to those established in Northern Ireland, is at least worth discussing in detail. In my personal opinion, in any case, in order for Parliament to cope with the heavy workload, it must be expanded. One place that I think can be fully utilized is the House of Lords. I must state that I do not intend to use this to counter the House of Commons. I only hope that the House of Lords will be more broadly representative, and at the same time establish a system of life members to maintain the main characteristic of individual transcendence. In addition, I hope that after the number of members is expanded, all necessary reforms can be made without destroying good traditions.

My personal opinion does not end there. Economic and industrial issues have become so important today that I believe that before they are dealt with by the resolutions of the House of Commons, they must be given full and practical discussion, and it should be completely separated from purely party theories and procedures. Years ago, Churchill proposed the establishment of an industrial council, composed of representatives from both labor and management, with the power to deal with social and industrial issues within the scope of guidance, and to draw conclusions from it and send them to Parliament for reference.

I believe that such a group will absorb the best people from both labor and management in the industry, and in particular will give both labor and management activities a new model and greater responsibility. Today, we have seen that Parliament is gradually being excluded from direct negotiations between the government and outside groups. These negotiations are inevitable, but in my opinion, the best answer to this crisis is to bring these relevant things back into the scope and responsibility of parliamentary institutions.

Making Parliament the center and focus of the country's political life, and ensuring that all issues that arise are fully, freely, and responsibly discussed in Parliament, and not allowing power to fall into the hands of irresponsible groups outside the circle, whether they are official institutions or industrial groups, should be the greatest goal of each of us who cherishes a free political system.

Amery of the UK on the BBC, and was later published in the Listener magazine. In the face of turbulent political turmoil in Europe, the UK has been able to remain stable, which is not accidental. Readers may get some answers after reading this article. The reason for introducing this article is that it can help us understand the British political system and its various subtle relationships.

All our officers must earnestly comply with it and regard it as a guiding principle. No insincere compliance or treating it as a mere formality is allowed. Now, several points are specially put forward to reiterate the warnings:

If a timely decision cannot be made because further investigation is necessary, a guarantor should be sought to await the decision. Detention must not be arbitrarily imposed.

Fines should be imposed accordingly, and detention or penal labor should not be decided lightly.

Non-Felons Must Not Be Arrested

(2) Regarding the handling of criminal cases: (1) Non-felons must not be arrested directly, and attention should be paid to their physical well-being and reputation during the arrest.

All statements, whether favorable or unfavorable, should be noted, and no violence, coercion, fraud, inducement, or other improper methods should be used.

(4) The custody and detention of criminal suspects should be limited to what is necessary to maintain the purpose of the detention and the order of the detention center. Unless there is a risk of violence or suicide, their bodies must not be restrained.

(5) Criminal suspects who have committed crimes with the most severe possible sentence of imprisonment of six months or less, detention, or fines exclusively, must not be subject to application for custody.

A Receipt Should Be Given for Items Seized During a Search

(6) If the establishment of a crime depends on a civil legal relationship, the suspect should be released on bail immediately after the interrogation, and no application for custody should be made.

(7) Homes and other places must not be searched directly unless one of the following circumstances exists: (1) Those who should be arrested or subjected to detention and custody according to law; (2) Those pursuing a current felon or arresting an escapee; (3) Those with facts sufficient to believe that someone inside is committing a crime and the situation is urgent.

(9) Regarding items seized during a search that are deemed admissible as evidence and should be impounded, a receipt should be made, detailing the name and quantity of the impounded items.

At that time, three employees of the Bank of China, Zhang Songci, Liu Shanchang, and Zhou Yaojin, were arrested by the security authorities because they were considered to be the leading figures of the "Liaison Association of Employees of the Four Banks and Two Bureaus."

### Accused of Embezzlement in Manufacturing Coal Balls: Former Manager of Quanneng Factory on Trial; Claims Mud Was Not Mixed Evenly; Embezzlement of Dividends Not Prosecuted Due to Amnesty

[Report from this newspaper] The case of Yao Linsheng, the former manager of the Quanneng Coal Ball Factory in this city, being accused of malpractice, was publicly tried in court yesterday after being prosecuted by the District Procuratorate. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 19th of this month. Yao once served as the manager of the Quanneng Coal Ball Factory and left office in June last year. During his tenure as manager, he was accused of embezzling dividends and profits, and privately selling 15 tons of the 500,000 tons of coal powder allocated to him, and mixing in inferior coal powder. In addition, the coal balls manufactured by the Quanneng Coal Factory, entrusted by government agencies to manufacture coal balls for civil servants and teachers, were substandard and were confirmed by the Fuel Management Committee's inspection. Subsequently, the Material Supply Review Committee for Civil Servants and Teachers in this city and Li Jianrong, a shareholder of the factory, filed a complaint. After investigation by the District Procuratorate, the embezzlement of dividends and profits occurred before 1946 and met the conditions for the amnesty, so it was not prosecuted. As for the private sale of coal powder and the manufacture of substandard coal balls, he was prosecuted for embezzlement. Yao argued in court yesterday that the coal powder part had been reported to the Fuel Management Committee, and the heating value of the manufactured coal balls was standardized at 640 degrees. Sometimes, because the technicians did not mix the auxiliary fuel mud evenly, the firepower was sometimes strong and sometimes weak. He denied embezzlement. After the final court hearing, the date for the verdict was scheduled.

As a result, it was learned that the flatbed truck was No. 1818, and the flatbed truck driver was named Li Gongxing. He was summoned to the bureau for questioning and confessed that a total of four bundles of white cloth were unloaded at the vacant lots on Zhoushan Road and Yuezhou Road, and at the Xinlajiqiao Wharf.

Subsequently, section member Lu Zhao, police chief Zhao Bingyue, Zhang Xu, and others were dispatched to conduct an investigation. Later, it was learned that the main suspect, Chen Kechang, often went to the Xian Shi Amusement Park to play, so police officers were dispatched to guard the park for several days, but to no avail.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Freight Train Derails at West Station; Two Sections Overturn; Fortunately, No Casualties

When changing tracks in the third parallel track, it suddenly derailed, and the last two freight cars overturned. Several sections of the track were damaged, but fortunately, all that was loaded in the cars were radishes and there were no passengers. After receiving the news, the Engineering Section immediately sent workers to rush to repair the tracks.

### Regarding the Registration of Population Migration: Still Handled by Autonomous Organizations; Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau Releases Statement

According to a statement released by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the municipal government, regarding the change of population migration registration to be handled by the police, how the powers of the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau are divided is still unclear to the outside world. It has been investigated that the Civil Affairs Bureau previously received and issued to subordinate agencies the eight key points for police agencies and household registration agencies to investigate and report household registration, as promulgated by the Ministry of Interior, among which the fourth item stipulates that applications for population migration registration should be handled by the police agencies. This does not clarify the previous connection between the household registration registration handled by the Bureau and the police agencies. In this city, not only migration registration, but also other types of household registration registration, have a notification slip attached to the application form. Each district security officer notifies the police agency to register after accepting the application for registration for investigation.

The autonomous organizations in this city are currently handling conscription business directly related to suppressing the rebellion, and the overall distribution of resources for stabilizing people's livelihoods, all of which rely on the accuracy of household registration registration. The frequent migration of the urban population accounts for almost the main part of all household registration registration. If migration registration is handled by the police agency, and the autonomous organization cannot grasp the accuracy of the overall population at any time, then the handling of people's livelihood distribution and conscription business will inevitably fail. For example, a certain agency in Huangpu District recently suddenly applied to move out more than 200 young men in an attempt to evade military service. In view of this, the Municipal Council passed a resolution and telegraphed the Ministry of Interior to withdraw the order, and the registration of citizen migration is still handled by the autonomous organizations. For the needs of the business, I have also met with Ren Xianqun, Director of the Civil Affairs Investigation Committee, to request instructions from Mayor Wu, and after receiving a personal discussion, in order to facilitate the direct and flexible handling of conscription and distribution, it was approved to follow the decision of the Municipal Council that the household registration agency directly handle migration registration. However, the population of this city is mixed and changes are large. The autonomous organizations rely on the assistance of the police agency more than ever, and the police agency itself also needs to understand the population situation in this city based on the needs of security. It is hoped that they can provide more assistance in accordance with Article 5 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Household Registration Law, "In existing police districts, police agencies should assign police officers to assist household registration personnel in handling investigations...," which will be more beneficial to the future of household registration.

### Another Policeman's Handgun Is Snatched

### Impersonating Tax Bureau Official; Forced Sale of Publications Leads to Detention

[Report from Our Newspaper] Shi Yong, who impersonated an official from the Direct Taxation Bureau, was transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation by the Xin Cheng Police Precinct yesterday.

### Qingzhi Temple in Lianjiang; Visiting the Bone Storage Pagoda of the Late Chairman Lin

[Report from Our Newspaper in Fuzhou, dated 8th] It has been five years since the passing of the late Chairman Lin. As for the death of this elder, who presided over the central government for nearly a decade and was deeply respected by people at home and abroad, his post-mortem situation should be something that people want to know.

The elder was frugal and generous throughout his life, with no savings in his family. His only interest was in associating with monks and Taoists. During his time in Fujian, he spent half of his time sitting around playing chess, brewing tea, and discussing scriptures. He traveled extensively to various temples in the county, such as Tongquan Temple in Gushan and Shengsui Temple in Luoyuan, but he was particularly admiring of Qingzhi Temple in Lianjiang. More than 20 years ago, when he returned after serving as Speaker of the Senate, he built a bone storage pagoda on the sunny side of the mountain, stating that he would be buried in this mountain after his death. Since then, whenever he wrote or composed poetry, he always signed "Qingzhi Elder." The elder's love for this temple was to this extent. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the National Government retreated westward. Five years later, he passed away from a long illness. At that time, the central government, in order to give preferential treatment to this

Founder of the Nation, did not allow the remains to be transported a long distance, and buried him in a mountain cave in the temporary capital. After the victory, the elders of Fujian repeatedly made suggestions on this matter. After weighing the pros and cons, the Executive Yuan approved the reconstruction of a cenotaph at Qingzhi Temple in Fujian, and allocated 200 million yuan a month ago to order its repair, which can also express the central government's love and cherishing of the revolutionary founder's legacy. Local elders, the Lin clan, and the Provincial Construction Department have conducted several surveys.

A reporter visited the area in person a few days ago. The mountain is in Guanlang Town, Lianjiang. This town is the starting point of the Guanfen section of the first national highway between Fujian and Zhejiang. It is located at the source of the Min River and can be said to be the transportation hub between the provincial capital and more than a dozen counties in eastern Fujian. It can be reached by speedboat from Fuzhou in three to four hours. From Guanlang Town to the foot of the mountain is about five li. Climbing up the steps along the west side of the mountain, there are many

Splendid Lin Stones, with jagged rocks, towering peaks, and caves, such as Bat Cave and Seven Void Cave, which are among the best. There are also many villas such as "Xuyuan," and the environment is very beautiful. Qingzhi Temple is located halfway up the mountain. In front of the temple, ancient trees tower into the sky. Inside, the painted pillars are always new. When asked, Wan Zhang replied: This was built by Lin when he returned home in 1934. The temple is divided into three halls, front, middle, and back, and the decoration is very elegant. The monks in the temple also vividly describe the anecdotes of the late Lin in those years. It is said that whenever Lin returned home, the villagers would support the old and carry the young to welcome him. Lin especially liked to go along the mountain for dozens of miles on sunny and breezy days (according to: Lin's ancestral home is Shanggan Fenghang Village) to climb mountains and appreciate the scenery. He was in

Side of Qingzhi Temple, another villa, Xiaoyu Villa, was built, with a Songfeng Pavilion on top. Each time he stayed there for a short time, quietly watching the waves. It is said that there are a total of 108 scenes before and after the mountain, with names such as "Stone Guanyin," "Stone Elephant," "Three Toads," "Stone Immortal Peach," "Damen Cave," "Su Wu Herding Sheep," "Immortal Rowing," etc., which are countless. The reporter invited them to accompany him and visited them one by one.

In the afternoon, I went down the mountain to survey the bone storage pagoda. The carved place is about a few hundred paces away from the temple. It is a platform beside the mountain, with an area of about dozens of feet, bounded by a short wall. The surrounding trees are lush, and the ancient stones are mossy, which is extremely quiet and peaceful. There is an iron railing across the entrance, inlaid with an iron lock. Inside, there are cloisters around, and in the middle, there are five stone steps and a three-story stone pagoda, built of bluestone. The project is quite sophisticated. There is a monument on the front of the pagoda, with the inscription: "Bone Storage Pagoda of Lin Sen, Speaker of the Senate," in seal script, and the words are vigorous. In addition to a few stone benches and flower railings, there is nothing else inside. The walls are covered with vines and trees, and the corners of the ground are covered with weeds, showing a desolate scene. It is reported that the future

"Cenotaph" is also intended to be renovated and completed here.

After returning, the reporter asked the officials involved in the construction plan about this matter. According to reports: Regarding the bone storage pagoda, the base stone will be added around the base of the pagoda to prevent rainwater from entering and damaging the base. Behind the pagoda, there is a three-foot stone cave in the wilderness, which is planned to be renovated for burying ashes or placing clothes in the future. As for the stone monument on the front, it is planned to be changed to "Cenotaph of the Late Chairman Lin of the National Government" by famous craftsmen. The stone monument on the reverse side will be used to engrave the tomb record for permanent commemoration.

Xiaoyu Villa is built on the mountain, and the tide is not suitable, so it is planned to cut off a few feet of the strict stone behind the mountain, raise the roof, and open doors and windows to circulate air and prevent wind and rain. According to Jiang Yuancheng, a famous stonemason who went to the survey together: The bone storage pagoda was built by him in those years. Now he is old (67 years old) and unable to do it himself, but he is grateful for the late Chairman Lin's kindness during his lifetime, and he is willing to return to his ancestral home in Nan'an to solicit famous craftsmen to build it here. The total construction cost is estimated by him to be more than 1 billion yuan, which may be subsidized by the Executive Yuan or raised by his fellow villagers. Jiang's spirit is still vigorous, saying that the stone lions donated by Fujian Province to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing in those years were also made by him, and he was the late Chairman Lin's oldest "patron."

### Nouveau Riche in Yinzhou, Wang Shankang, Coveted by Bandits; Wife Killed, Husband Kidnapped

[Report from Our Newspaper in Ningbo, dated 11th] The Zhougongzhai area in western Yinzhou has steep mountains and remote locations, which is where bandits haunt. There is a nouveau riche named Wang Shankang, who recently started construction on a vacant lot in his ancestral home, building a two-story Western-style house. It was completed a month ago, and Wang took his family back from Shanghai to live in the new house and enjoy the tranquility of the forest, which aroused the covetousness of bandits. Late last night, when Wang's family was fast asleep, they suddenly heard urgent knocking on the door. Wang heard the sound and ordered his servant, Abao, to go to the door to see. The bandits said that they had come from Shanghai to Ningbo to visit Mr. Wang for important business. Abao did not suspect anything else and opened the door to invite them in. After the door was opened, he saw that the visitors were all dressed in blue short coats, holding flashlights, and three or four of them were holding wooden shells (guns). The bandits pointed the guns at Abao's chest and told him not to make a sound, then swaggered in. Wang saw that Abao had been out for a long time and had not come in, so he took a lantern downstairs to investigate. He met the bandits, who tied Wang up. They then jumped upstairs. Wang's wife, Zhou, shouted loudly, which angered the bandits. With a bang, she fell on the bed. The bandits then rummaged through boxes and cabinets, searching wildly for more than an hour, and took Wang with them before leaving with a roar. Before leaving, they left a letter stating that they needed 500 million yuan for ransom, otherwise they would tear up the ticket. The next morning, Wang's relatives and friends heard the news and hurried to the Suijing Office to report and request strict investigation and legal action.

### Interlude in Conscription; The Japanese are Here

[Report from Our Newspaper in Wujin, dated 12th] The Jiufengxi Township Office in this county recently urgently needed to meet the conscription deadline. To cope with this, they introduced a man named Li Jialou through Jin Shugen and Tao Rushan from Henglin. He was of the right age and claimed to have served in the 70th Division. He was injured in 1945 and was now discharged from the Henglin Rear Hospital after being cured. The Township Office thought it was correct and sent him directly to the new soldier conscription office. However, when the office inquired about the household registration of the baojia, Li was unable to answer. At first, he claimed to be Taiwanese, then he spoke in incomprehensible words. It was then realized that he was Japanese. However, his origin was unknown, and he may have escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Nanjing. The office detained him and summoned the introducers for questioning, and handed them all over to the county government for interrogation.

### Accident on Xihu Bus; Veteran Officer Run Over and Killed

### Gambler's Dead End; Lying on Rails Seeking Death

[Report from Our Newspaper in Chongming, dated 12th] Yu Qigou, a resident of Chenjia Town, was addicted to gambling and had a huge loss since the Spring Festival, which he was unable to pay back. He had once attempted suicide by hanging but was saved. Recently, the creditors urged him to pay back, so he stood on the highway the day before yesterday, waiting for a car to come, and then lay down in front of the car, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, the driver braked immediately, and he was not run over and killed, but only suffered injuries to his hands and feet.

### Visiting Sun Yuanliang After the Recovery of Xuchang

[Report from Our Newspaper in Zhengzhou, dated 8th] The reporter started from Zhengzhou, hoping to arrive in the city on the day of the recovery of Xuchang, because the news of the recovery had not yet reached my ears. I did not know that General Sun Yuanliang and the vanguard troops had entered the city together that day. That day, a commissioner said to us, "General Sun, coming out of Sichuan, immediately opened up the Pinghan Line as soon as he arrived at the front line, and he was successful." Yes, General Sun had just come out of Chongqing and immediately showed his skills. In fact, in the history of the Anti-Japanese War, he had already written the glorious record of the Battle of Miaohangzhen, which made the international community recognize "This is the first time that the Chinese army fought the Japanese army and defeated the Japanese army on the battlefield." In the end, he defeated the Japanese army in important places such as Dushan Nanzhou, and wrote the final page that contributed to the collapse of the Japanese army. This history of the Anti-Japanese War seems to have been started by him and ended by him, which is very coincidental.

He told the reporter frankly: "In the past, we underestimated the strength of the bandits, so sometimes we inevitably suffered some small losses, but it is also wrong for us to overestimate the strength of the bandits now." He spoke so frankly that it immediately reminded people of when he was in Chongqing, someone advised him to govern the chaotic world with heavy penalties, and he replied: "I am a soldier who serves the public and abides by the law. Heavy penalties can only be used legally." He is not only rational but also extremely enthusiastic. He told the reporter that he was very moved by the welcome he received from the people when he entered the city.

He is only forty-four years old and very handsome. This handsomeness is expressed on the one hand in his conversation and on the other hand in his handsome appearance. He is very rare among Chinese generals. In the past two years, he has been very sad for China because of the bandits' disturbances. He believes that now the bandits must be suppressed by attacking the main force, so that they cannot flee east and west. He is very optimistic about everything.

General Sun does not smoke, does not drink, and is humble and modest to people. These qualities are all in line with the virtues of his uncle, General Sun Decao. He said that he loves the north and likes the plains, which shows his broad-mindedness, even though he grew up in the mountains.

After the recovery of Xuchang, he hopes that the people who have fled, especially those responsible for local affairs, will return as soon as possible, because everything must be done by everyone in order to do it well. (Reported by our reporter Fan Shiqin)

### Tomorrow's Start to Purchase Export Goods; Appraisal Committee Formally Established Yesterday; Locations Tentatively Set at Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou; Purchase Prices to be Announced Daily by the China Trust Bureau

[Our Report] The Export Goods Appraisal Committee convened its inaugural meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday. Representatives from various units attended, including Chen Shangren from the Export Control Commission, Shao Zenghua from the Central Bank, He Tanlin from the China Trust Bureau, Zhang Shenghua from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Diao Minren from the Four Banks Joint Treasury, totaling six individuals. The representative from the Ministry of Finance, Shang Zhu, was appointed. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM.

Several important resolutions were reached at yesterday's meeting: (1) The organizational regulations of the Appraisal Committee were approved, pending submission to the Export Control Commission for review. (2) The Export Control Commission, the Central Bank, and the China Trust Bureau were mutually elected as standing committee members. (3) It was decided to initially purchase tung oil, with purchasing locations tentatively set at Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou. Furthermore, it was decided that the maximum purchase price would be communicated by the China Trust Bureau to its branches in various locations. Starting next week, these branches would determine prices within this maximum limit and announce them daily. (4) The Appraisal Committee is scheduled to hold a regular meeting every Saturday.

Chen Junren, Director of the Export Promotion Department of the Export Control Commission, met with reporters after the meeting, stating: Since the National Economic Council decided to purchase seven major export goods, including tung oil, hog bristles, raw silk, tea, soybeans, eggs, and wool, the principles and methods of purchase have yet to be finalized, but to save time, preparations must begin immediately. Because the international market price of tung oil has fallen sharply, to protect the legitimate profits of merchants, purchases will be made first. However, this time, purchases are limited to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou to avoid competing with the people for profit. Moreover, purchases are purely voluntary and not compulsory. Purchase prices will be based on market prices.

### Market Rumors Boost Buying; Chinese Stocks Turn Buoyant at Closing

Chinese stocks were sluggish yesterday morning but buoyant in the afternoon. Generally, due to abundant cash flow and deposit accounts, there was some liquidation. However, major players and younger investors took profits and re-entered, and the current deferred interest rate even approached forty cents. Midday saw some trading, and the stimulation of buying rumors before the close unexpectedly reversed the trend, ending bullishly at high levels.

Starting weak in the morning, Wing On Spinning opened at 1405 yuan and 1490 yuan, quickly falling to low prices of 1380 yuan and 1465 yuan. Buyers emerged, pushing the price back up to 1415 yuan and 1502 yuan. However, with tight cash flow, the current deferred rate widened, leading to some pullback, falling to 1395 yuan and 1480 yuan. Another round of buying pushed the price to 1428 yuan and 1518 yuan, but it soon retreated again to 1400 yuan and 1483 yuan. Later, rumors of a strike at the Bank of China, brisk sales of yarn and cloth, and the arrival of documents regarding reduced certification, boosted confidence again. People eagerly bought, and the price rose to highs of 1428 yuan and 1523 yuan at the close, ending at 1428 yuan and 1522 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Sino-French, Jingfu, China Silk, and Tongyi were flat; Wing On Spinning, Mayer & Feisal, Sincere, Wah Feng, Sun Kwong, Match, China Cement, China Textile, and Zhabei rose slightly; Wah Hsin, New China, National Products, Kin Hing, Jing Lun, Li An, Wing Kung, and Rong Feng declined slightly; Underwear and Commercial each rose by half a cent; and Da Tung, Chung Hsing, and Heng Feng fell by half a cent. In deferred delivery shares, Wah Feng, Jingfu, and Kin Hing declined slightly, while Wing On Spinning, Sincere, Sun Kwong, and Mayer & Feisal rose slightly. Among unlisted stocks traded off the exchange, the Bank of China fell by half a cent, the weakest performer. Hua Cheng remained stable, while the rest declined slightly.

### Unified Bonds Rebound; Foreign Stocks Slightly Higher

Government bonds fell back somewhat yesterday. Unified C bonds started at 126,000, falling to a low of 116,000 before rebounding and trading sideways. Compared to the previous close, A, B, and D bonds each fell by 6,000 yuan, C bonds fell by 9,000 yuan, and E bonds fell by 7,000 yuan. Turnover was approximately 4 million.

Foreign stocks continued to advance yesterday. Ewo Yarns started at 1.75 million, rebounding to a high of 1.86 million before trading sideways. Except for a slight decline in Telephone, Steel rose the most. Guangdong buyers absorbed some, and as a result, compared to the previous close, Telephone fell slightly, while Hongkong Land, Jardine Matheson, and Ewo Yarns rose by half a cent. Paper was flat, while Ewo Flat, Wheelock Marden, Jardine Engineering, and Guangdong rose slightly. Steel rose by ten percent.

### No Increase in Export Financing; Salt Transport Facing a Precarious Situation

[Our Report] This reporter has learned from salt merchants in this city that the salt industry, which is crucial to the people's livelihood, is facing a serious crisis. There are approximately 150 salt merchants in this city, who before the war relied on bank export financing for working capital, amounting to about 70% of the salt cost. After the war, currency depreciation and soaring prices have made salt field prices, sack costs, and transportation fees all very expensive. However, the export financing provided to salt merchants by the "Xingdai Banking Syndicate" remains the same as before, with no increase, and has fallen to less than 10% of the salt cost. As a result, salt merchants have had to borrow at high interest rates from external sources to increase capital, with interest rates of over 20%, which must be paid in advance. Thus, the salt cost increases by 20% to 30% every month. In normal circumstances, it takes about four months for salt to be transported from the salt fields to the point of sale, and sometimes it is delayed for six or seven months. According to this calculation, the salt cost increases by more than 100%. However, salt is a designated commodity for sale, and the selling price and sales location are restricted. Therefore, after salt merchants transport and sell the salt, the proceeds are no longer sufficient to purchase the same quantity of salt, causing the quantity of salt to decrease gradually. On one hand, this affects the livelihood of salt farmers in the salt fields and the needs of the people. On the other hand, it causes significant losses in national tax revenue. At the same time, the "Ever-Normal Granary Salt" managed by the salt authorities for daily reserves and regulation is an excellent idea, but the excessive quantity exceeding the limited sales area also strikes a blow to salt merchants. Therefore, salt merchants in this city hope that the government can pay close attention to this crisis and increase export financing for salt merchants in line with salt costs and freight rates, so as to increase the quantity of salt transported, supply the people, and increase national tax revenue.

### After Widespread Rice Rationing, the Rice Market is Stagnant; Rice Prices Fell Uniformly Yesterday in Both Northern and Southern Markets

[Our Report] Rice prices fell universally yesterday due to (1) tightening credit, (2) reports of small harvests in producing areas, and (3) sluggish sales after widespread rice rationing. Sellers are competing to sell, and prices have been repeatedly lowered. However, due to the increased distribution of household ration rice, the whole city is now widely supplied, and rice stores mainly sell ration rice, without needing to replenish supplies from the market. Therefore, sales are particularly stagnant, and with increased arrivals, there is a situation of supply exceeding demand. In the northern market, white keng rice fell to 3.7 million, thin rice was 3.6 million, and yang hsien rice was 3.65 million. Special high keng rice traded at 3.8 million, each falling by over ten to twenty thousand. However, the market became even weaker towards the close, with declines of over two hundred thousand. The southern market saw a decline from the opening, and it became even more severe later, with almost no one inquiring. Thin rice was 3.6 million, and later, there were prices as low as 3.5 million. The total arrivals in the northern and southern markets yesterday were 10,556 shih.

Flour: With falling rice prices, tight credit, and falling prices in other ports, the market also followed suit. Sellers, needing funds, continued to offer, but buyers, due to the declining market, were afraid to take on too much, and prices fell by thirty to forty thousand yuan in the face of oversupply. Trading was slow.

Miscellaneous Grains: Prices fluctuated. Yellow beans followed the decline in rice prices, and confidence was weak. Buyers from other provinces were not interested, and sellers, facing tight credit, felt they had no way to reverse the situation. Hankou peas fell to 1.75 million yuan, a decrease of 180,000 yuan. The future market remains weak. Pinghu broad beans also fell by 50,000 to 780,000 yuan. Corn, with renewed interest from Qingdao buyers, rose sharply at the beginning of the market, but the market was slightly weaker later, still gaining 150,000 yuan. Red sorghum was in short supply and rose by 100,000 yuan. Green beans also rose sharply. Tianjin buyers purchased sesame, rising by 200,000 yuan. Hankou white sesame was 3.7 million yuan. Shelled peanuts rose sharply, with strong buying from Guangdong. Qinhuangdao shelled peanuts broke through the 5 million mark, rising by 5-600,000 yuan.

Cooking Oil: Began to fall back. Because all grains were falling, confidence was low, and there was not much interest from local buyers. Some small sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell, so the market fell by 250,000 yuan from the opening. Dayouyu and Datong's No. 2 factory both opened soybean oil at 6.95 million, and there were many round-trip trades. Dayou's soybean oil later could not be bought for 6.95 million. The amount of raw oil sold was less than soybean oil. Qingdao Ji brand raw oil opened at 8 million, later 8.1 million yuan, slightly lower by 150,000 yuan. In terms of underlying strength, it was firmer than soybean oil. Round-trip raw vegetable oil was 6.85 million yuan, also falling by over 200,000 yuan. Small cart sesame oil initially opened at 7.7 million, later returning to 7.8 million, falling by 200,000 yuan. Soybean cake, with hesitant buying from the oil gang, fell with Shantou prices. Sipaibing cakes were cut by 3-40,000 yuan each.

### National Bank Economic Research Department Convened Rice and Grain Symposium

The symposium was chaired by Ji Chaoding, Director of the Department, and the discussion of rice and grain issues was very detailed, adjourning at 6:00 PM.

Textile Construction Sells Cloth

[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 18,210 bolts of cloth and 120 bedsheets. There were 782 purchase applications, including 39 from manufacturers, purchasing 1,350 bolts of cloth.

### Cotton Yarn Weak; Cloth Declines

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a continued decline in prices due to increased supply, tighter credit among peers, and hesitant interest from buyers from other provinces. Floating holders continued to sell off. However, fine yarn saw some replenishment by weaving businesses taking advantage of low prices near the close. Therefore, the final 42-count Blue Press fine yarn, after falling, rebounded to the original level of 177 million yuan, leveling with the previous day.

40-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose by about 1 million yuan. 32-count Double Strand Flourishing Harvest also rose by 2 million yuan. In addition, 21-count Double Horse Yard singles saw increased selling at the midday close due to excess float, falling by 1 million yuan. Spot prices also fell by 1 million yuan. All grades of yarn below 20-count mostly fell again by 5-600,000 to 3-500,000 yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw continuous liquidation from buyers due to tightening credit from the morning opening. Combined with the Textile Construction Company opening up ample quotas, the market showed supply exceeding demand. Major players released stocks at high prices, and yarn and flower gangs followed suit. Those buyers from other provinces short on funds also sold off, and pressure from peers was very strong. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell all the way down, closing at a disastrous 3.49 million yuan, a sharp decline of 240,000 yuan from the previous day.

Zhenzhong, Colorful Ball, Five Blessings, and other fine cloths also fell by 150,000 to 300,000 yuan. However, suddenly, rumors of continued contraction of the Hong Kong electricity supply boosted yarn prices and changed sentiment. Asking prices rose again, and Dragon Head spot prices rebounded to 3.55 million yuan with transactions, and the rest were also higher than the closing prices. Throughout the day, prices of Four Gentlemen, Twilled Serge, and fabric twills all fell by 2-300,000 yuan, but the underlying strength of raw cloth, blue cloth, and Shilin cloth was still stable.

### Silk Trading Quiet; Silk Goods Uniformly Weak

Artificial silk started weak yesterday but then rebounded firmly, with results similar to the previous day's market. 120-count Asahi brand glossy silk opened at 200 million yuan in the morning, reaching a maximum of 200.3 million yuan in the middle.

Silk Goods: The market fell yesterday. Huaqiang True Silk bedcovers opened within the 100 million yuan mark, and the market fell straight down as the raw materials softened slightly and confidence was inevitably weak. The minimum fell to around 93 million yuan, and the close rose slightly to 97 million yuan for immediate delivery.

At the same time, Huacheng Tobacco Company distributed sales of the Beautiful Golden Rat cigarettes, with 50,000 Beautiful cigarettes priced at 100 million yuan and Golden Rat priced at 60 million yuan. There were surprisingly many dumpings in the market, with abundant sources of supply, and the market fell sharply.

### Mogao Caves of Dunhuang

Dunhuang, located more than 1,200 kilometers west of Lanzhou, was as prosperous as Shanghai today from the Qin, Han, Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Sui, Tang, and Song Dynasties, serving as a center for cultural, economic, and political exchange between East and West. The "Mogao Caves" in this oasis in the remote desert, built like beehives on the cliffs of a mountain valley forty miles southeast of the city, are a treasure left to us by our ancestors, worthy of our admiration for the meritorious achievements of those who came before us. In terms of historical research, cultural scholarship, religion, art, and social conditions, it holds unparalleled value.

Since 1907, when the Englishman Stein traveled from India to western Gansu and carried away a large number of ancient manuscripts, paintings, and antiques to London, followed by the French sinologist Paul Pelliot, who specially came to take away a large number of cultural relics, these many documents shocked the literary world worldwide at that time. Those documents also corrected many historical inaccuracies and shortened the road to studying history.

Now, only 309 of the more than 1,000 caves, stretching 1,612 meters in length, remain with immovable and untransportable murals and sculptures, still the richest, most complete, and most systematic cultural relics in the world.

These murals, which can be expanded to a total length of 25 kilometers, and more than 2,000 sculptures, from the Northern Wei, Western Wei, Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, to the Song and Yuan Dynasties, all represent the different styles of the first era. The works of the Wei Dynasty are bold, monotonous, strange, and unrestrained, representing the form of the initial style. After the short Sui Dynasty to the early Tang Dynasty, there were already significant changes. By the Flourishing Tang period, it had reached the most mature stage, with the beauty of the lines, the accuracy of the outlines, the richness of the colors, and the perfection of the composition reaching the highest peak of art. By the Late Tang, Five Dynasties, and even the Song and Yuan Dynasties, with the changes of the times and the decline of politics and economy, and influenced by the fact that religious art had already formed a category, it also became weak, powerless, and crudely made works.

### On Criticism

— Xu Ren

Strictly speaking, we really aren't qualified to comment on others. Why is this? I might as well offer two reasons here. First, who is without fault? If a person has no mistakes in dozens of years, he must have been deified from the moment he was born. Many of the things we say about others in our daily lives, upon careful consideration, are no different from the pot calling the kettle black. Superficially, we are discussing others, but in reality, we are slandering our own shadow. Second, the rights and wrongs of the world are not as easy to determine as one might imagine. Zhuangzi said long ago, "This is one right and wrong, that is another right and wrong." But reading various Chinese and foreign ancient and modern theories, for any issue, there is inevitably a "positive argument," a "negative argument," and a "compromise argument." Hegel's "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" philosophy merely illustrates that right and wrong are relative and constantly changing. Therefore, it is not easy to establish absolute standards of right and wrong.

Therefore, unless it is absolutely necessary, we should strictly avoid the habit of casually commenting on people and things. Even if we want to comment on people and things, we must do so with a proactive attitude. We must know that criticism is a kind of construction, not a kind of destruction. The common saying "scolding people" is really not a good example. The person being scolded is unwilling to accept it sincerely, and what result can the person scolding achieve?

What standards do we use to distinguish between constructive criticism and destructive criticism? I believe that constructive criticism must have two conditions. First, the motive for criticism must not be out of self-interest; second, the attitude of criticism must be based on good intentions. If you criticize others from the starting point of your own interests, your point of view will inevitably be wrong, as if you are looking at people with colored glasses. It will be difficult to reach a correct conclusion. For example, last year, "Free Talk" published a cartoon by Mr. Feng Zikai. A cat stole a fish. Mr. Meng's explanation was that the cat stole because it was not full, and the fault was still with the person. Therefore, when criticizing people and things, one must take the other party's position as one's own, put oneself in the other's shoes and think for the other party. This way, one can obtain a correct criticism. Otherwise, one's feelings are confused, one's heart is not right, and the words spoken are inevitably just aimless talk and cannot be called criticism.

Strictly speaking, only constructive criticism is true criticism. It must be understood that criticism is not aimed at venting, but at improving things. Therefore, if the speaker is determined to destroy, his motive must be out of self-interest, and his words will naturally only satisfy his own selfish desires and show off his own prejudices. What good is it for improving things? Looking at the current opinions, we know that there are too many arguments aimed at venting and too few arguments aimed at improving. The result is naturally more destruction than construction.

We must know that destructive things are easier to do, while constructive things are much more difficult. It is easy for bystanders to make comments, but the difficulties faced by those involved in the matter are often unimaginable to those who have not experienced it personally. The common saying "others carrying burdens do not know how hard it is" is the meaning of this. Therefore, when discussing people and things, we must do so with an extremely cautious attitude. The ancient saying "final judgment after the coffin is closed" means that a person's life must still be observed for its subsequent effects.

Today's people's discussion of people and things often goes astray because it is too general. For example, in the current situation of inflation, when people meet, they inevitably say some negative things. The severity of today's economic situation is undeniable, but upon careful study, it is not as serious as most people imagine. You know that current prices are indeed rising, which is a great threat to many people, but today there are many people in society whose income has often exceeded their pre-war income for the same affairs. Today, some people only know that prices are rising, but forget how abundant their income is, and thus express some "blaming the heavens and blaming others" arguments. What is their intention? Furthermore, regarding the issue of economic collapse, I believe that the Chinese people have always valued the doctrine of the mean and inherently have a latent power that is not easy to collapse; this is the first point. My country is an agricultural society, and in today's villages, the economy is often based on physical objects, so the impact of currency changes is not very large; this is the second point. Today's economy is a production problem, not a currency problem. According to personal observation, some people today are constantly making a fuss about the currency problem. I am afraid that there are some who are making malicious predictions, because they have hoarded a lot of goods and are afraid that prices will not rise and the currency will not collapse.

Westerners have a theory that "criticism is sympathy." Presumably, its purpose is nothing more than "putting yourself in the other's shoes and thinking for them." Therefore, only well-intentioned criticism is true criticism, and only constructive criticism can have a reforming effect on society.

### Origins of Common Sayings

— Jiang Duansheng

Many conversations in the streets and alleys originate from historical books. People often use them habitually without noticing. If one can investigate them slightly, one will surely find it interesting, and one will also know that not a single word is without a source and origin. For example, the common saying "useless" comes from the "Records of the Grand Historian." When Emperor Qin Shi Huang heard that Lu Sheng was secretly criticizing him and had fled, he was furious and said, "I previously collected books from all over the world, and all those that were useless were discarded." Also, "utter defeat" and "rascal" are both found in the "Basic Annals of Gaozu"; "impatient" is found in the biography of Song Gengbing, and also in the "History of the Five Dynasties," when Tang Mingzong was about to establish Empress Cao, he said to Consort Wang, "I am often ill and impatient. Sister should replace me." Cursing people as "mongrels" comes from the eulogy in the "Records of the Former Yan," which says: "Stupid mongrels, what can be done!" The common saying for hiding is "pan," during the time of Chen Houzhu, there was a rumor that said: "Qiyun Temple, when the invaders come, there is nowhere to pan." Saying something is secure is "tuo tie," Du Fu's poem has the line "Thousands of miles are initially secure." Giving gifts is "zuo ren qing," Du Fu's poem has the line "Coarse rice makes human kindness." Something that is empty and lacks substance is "kong tou," which comes from the "History of the Northern Dynasties," Biography of Huliu Jin, which has the line "The empty-headed Han should be killed." A habit is "mao bing," Huang Shangu's "Notes on Documents" says: "This is a Jiangnan person's habit." Hot but not very hot is "wen tun," Bai Letian's poem has the line "The pool water is warm and tepid." As for the common saying for buying things, "buy things," after examining ancient books, I have not been able to find its origin. It is probably due to a misinterpretation. However, according to the "Rabbit Garden Booklet," "During the Chongzhen era, Emperor Sizong established a Recreational Arts Hall to browse through literature, history, and geography. If he had any doubts, he would ask the court officials through the eunuchs. One day, he suddenly ordered a eunuch to ask the court officials, 'Now, in market transactions, people only say buy things, but not north and south. Why is that?' The court officials were caught off guard and could not answer. The assistant minister Zhou Yanru said, 'South is fire, north is water. People who knock on doors in the morning and evening to ask for water and fire will always be given it. This does not require trading, so they only say buy things.' The eunuch reported his words to the emperor, and Emperor Sizong approved of it." Also, I accidentally read a former person's notes, which I remember also discussed this, saying: "East governs birth and development, west governs harvest and storage, or it takes the meaning of east working and west completing." The above two explanations seem quite reasonable. In addition, saying that things are often stored in east-west facing rooms, so things are called "things," is far-fetched and seems unreliable. I specifically write it down to wait for those with broad knowledge.

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 12: A Chance Encounter (97)

Dao Yun continued, "I want to organize a film production company, and for all management and control, I hope that Miss Gu can cooperate with me fully." Qi Wan said, "I'm afraid I don't have the ability." Dao Yun said, "As long as Miss Gu is interested in this career, she will be of great help to me." Qi Wan said, "I am very interested in movies." Dao Yun said, "Then there is no problem. Can Miss Gu come to Shanghai with me?" Qi Wan said, "I have such a plan." Dao Yun said, "Then I don't need to look for a second talent in Beiping. With Miss Gu's help, I can do my job boldly." Qi Wan said, "I can help from the sidelines, but I can't support the whole thing on my own. I don't have the assets or the ability." Dao Yun said, "As for capital, I have already planned it out. What we are discussing now is the talent aspect. Now that Miss Gu is supporting the pillar, I am confident. With a few supporting actors in Shanghai, my film will be a success." As he spoke, he talked endlessly about the preparation process, how much money he had already spent, and how much money the product could earn. He also said that if the film business was run according to his method, it could dominate the film industry in the future. He also said that a certain tycoon in Hong Kong was in contact with him, and as long as this product could win the favor of most audiences, there would be rear support for how much capital to use. That night, Dao Yun talked in Qi Wan's house until after 9 o'clock, when the hospital nurse came to tell him that it was time to rest, and Dao Yun left. Qi Wan was very excited after hearing what he said, and felt that Dao Yun's talent and assets were better than Zhu Zhai's. It was just that he was used to being in the South, and his words did not seem as honest and reliable as Zhu Zhai's, but she couldn't blame him. Anyone who talks about business can't tell the truth. He said that he would cooperate with me, and of course he had other intentions. I will just wait and see what other conditions he has, and then proceed accordingly. Qi Wan was so disturbed by Dao Yun's words that she tossed and turned all night, thinking all night, and couldn't sleep well. The next day, it was only a little after 8 o'clock, and Qi Wan hadn't gotten out of bed yet, when she heard someone gently knocking on the door outside the room. Qi Wan thought it was the nurse, so she responded, "I'm awake, come in." When the door was pushed open, it was Dao Yun, wearing a bathrobe, who walked in. As he walked, he said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know that Miss Gu hadn't gotten up yet. Last night, I couldn't solve a problem that I thought of, so I didn't sleep all night. Today, as soon as it was dawn, I wanted to come over, but I didn't dare to come over, thinking that Miss Gu was already up by this time." As Dao Yun spoke, he had already walked to Qi Wan's bedside. He saw Qi Wan's amorous eyes looking at him affectionately, and he smiled and asked, "What made you unable to sleep?"

### Outside the School Gate

— Nian Hong

Mentioning reading seems to make one think of school; mentioning seeking knowledge makes one think of teachers. Traditional concepts have dominated us, forming a set of logic that to read and seek knowledge, one must enter school and seek advice from teachers.

These days are the time when various middle schools are starting school one after another. Due to the high tuition fees and the difficulty of obtaining scholarships, there must be many young people who are out of school. Pacing outside the school gate, watching former classmates go to register, they must feel very sad, even resentful and pessimistic. Parents also feel very ashamed and deeply guilty for not being able to let their children receive a complete education, as if they are sorry for their second generation. This kind of mentality is the result of the aforementioned traditional concepts, and there is really no need to think like this.

I am not saying that the scholars do not need to read, but that they do not necessarily have to squeeze into schools to learn from others, and spend a lot of money to obtain some diploma certificates. What we want to learn is true knowledge and true skills, and what parents hope for their children is just a skill, understanding of principles. Try to see if even middle school graduates or university graduates have true knowledge, true skills, a skill, and understanding of principles?

This is definitely not a sour grapes mentality, saying that school is bad because one cannot enter it, a way to comfort oneself. The facts are clearly placed before us, and even educators feel that such education needs to be reformed, so why must we be so attached to it and suffer in vain! The world outside the school is very big, and the time and place to learn are very wide. Why not shift your perspective and observe the endless real life around you, learn in life, temper yourself, and enrich yourself.

Of course, today's schools are also unstable, but compared with society, they still feel too comfortable. Young people should have the courage to face difficulties without fear. Today's society is dark, but we must not hide in a corner for temporary peace because of its darkness. Society itself is a university, this is an old saying. Since this is the case, then study hard in this school to learn some true knowledge.

Experience is skill, and this kind of skill can never be learned in books, but can only be accumulated from life. Moreover, leaving school does not mean leaving books. On the contrary, you can read more good books that you like and continue to learn and improve. Teachers are also not limited to teachers wearing long gowns and holding chalk, gesticulating in the classroom. Anyone who can learn in life can be his teacher. Haven't you heard what Confucius said? Here, I don't want to give examples of someone who succeeded in self-study or someone who didn't go to school. Anyway, the origins of these great men are also familiar to everyone.

Out of school or not, take a big step into the current society!

The Yellow Sea Play and the Taihu Flowers by Half-Dream Old Man

"One play to watch the Yellow Sea, ten thousand branches bloom with Taihu flowers, in my life I have seen natural beauty, and I can't help but feel the spiritual roots sprout." This is my old poem from when I returned from a mountain trip. Besides food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, we should consider "travel" as the most important. Being confined to one corner, busy all day long, not knowing what one is busy with. What I call the Yellow Sea refers to Huangshan in Huizhou, Anhui. Its wonderful scenery is natural and beyond all expectations. Its deep hidden places are all called the sea. The reason why it is called the "sea" is because there are coral islands and other strange crystal formations in the sea, which cannot be manufactured by human power. Over tens of millions of years, they have become an unimaginable state. The low-lying areas of Huangshan also contain these strange objects. The ancients had no way to describe them, so they simply called them the sea, hence the name "Yellow Sea." Among them are the Front Sea, Rear Sea, Heavenly Sea, West Sea, etc. The Rear Sea is behind the Lion Peak, and there are even more strangely shaped mountain peaks. The peaks of the Yellow Sea include the Beauty Looking in the Mirror, Guan Gong Blocking Cao, Dharma Crossing the River, and Sisters Herding Sheep. Generally, they all resemble something. They are named according to what people designate, about one hundred and several tens of places. I once traveled to this place and was amazed, so I called it the "Yellow Sea Play." The plays made by people in the world are nothing more than taking the guise of talented scholars and beautiful women, performing a play of resentful women and infatuated men, or a fight between tigers and dragons, a series of killings and arson. For tens of millions of years, they can't escape the facts recorded in history. Even if they are turned upside down, ministers assassinate kings, and sons assassinate fathers, betraying ethics and destroying righteousness, as fierce as beasts, or staging a bloody revolution, it is nothing more than swinging a grotesque swing in this world. After watching it for a long time, it is ultimately tasteless.

Besides the Yellow Sea Play, there are also the "Taihu Flowers," which must be seen. The largest lake in the southeast is Taihu Lake. Its area is said to be "36,000 qing of vast ocean, submerging 72 peaks." The largest in the lake is West Dongting Mountain, and its highest point is called Misty Peak. There are several mountains near Misty Peak, and the one with the best scenery is called Stone Elder Mountain. From Taihu Lake, Stone Elder Mountain looks like a celestial palace, a natural golden painting. At the foot of the mountain, there is the Washing Stone Residence, and further in is the Returning Cloud Cave. Yi Shifu's poem in the cave says: "Lingering by Stone Elder Mountain, the spring cold in the water country is still like autumn. Heaven outside heaven, boating, a guest within a guest is afraid to climb the tower. The vast smoke stretches for thousands of miles, the scenery is bleak and clear like ten continents. The fine rain and plum blossoms are extremely sad, where does the sound of flutes rise from fishermen?" In front is the Stone Elder Zen Temple, above is the Crane Coming Pavilion, outside is the Evening Light Cave. The Crane Coming Pavilion is the best place in the whole mountain. Opposite West Dongting Mountain is East Dongting Mountain. The highest point of East Mountain is called Mo Li Peak, but it is not as beautiful as West Dongting. Besides the two Dongting mountains, there is also Maqi Mountain, which can also be called majestic on the lake. My fellow villager Chu Jianweng has a chapter inscribed with the seven characters "Watching Ma Mountain from the Wind and Rain." Jianweng also asked me to write "Aotou," "Wangping," "Yungen," "Xuelang," and "Daxiongtai," totaling more than thirty inscriptions, carved on the stone walls of Dalewan, Xiangshan. At that time, I titled below them, saying: "Jianweng, Yunshi, and Cui Ran traveled together to Stone Elder and Linwu, climbed to the two peaks of Misty and Mo Li, and took in all the scenic spots in the lake. Returning here, they moored the boat straight down, and titled the two beautiful stones, Yungen and Xuelang, and then titled the various stones, west to Yutai, a total of more than thirty places, so that they all have good names for the benefit of future travelers. The fifteenth day of the tenth month of Renshen." This matter is now more than ten years ago, and I don't know if it still exists. To see the "Taihu Flowers," Dalewan is the best place. What are the Taihu Flowers? The fishing boats in Taihu Lake, with their sails full of wind, the largest of which have as many as seven sails, arranged vertically and horizontally, look like a flower with seven petals from a distance. Sometimes there are dozens of boats coming and going, almost like a group of flowers in full bloom, blooming all over the lake, which can be called a grand sight. In the vast expanse of 36,000 qing, there is this huge picture, how can one not be amazed! Dalewan belongs to the junction of Yixing and Changxing, Zhejiang, and can be called the extreme west in Taihu Lake. Most of the fishing boats come from the west or from east to west. With their sails full of wind, they must pass in front of Dalewan, so to see the Taihu Flowers, one must be on the road in Dalewan. In the past, Chu Jianweng had built four arches there as a place for tourists to rest. What the scene is like after the turmoil is unknown.

Our feelings change with the environment. If one looks around, the heaven and earth are lonely, and the individual is silently in it, there will be an incredible wave. For religious people, it is appropriate to explore the treasure of self-changing from the extremely profound and silent place, because our mind is forced by the environment, there is no place for scattered dissipation, gather the spirit, invigorate and move forward, and thus open up a strange and unusual realm. These realms cannot be known by those who have not personally experienced them, and they do not need to be known by others. Liang Rengong's "Free Book" once contained an article called "The World Outside the World," which stated: "When General Dixie conquered Egypt, a knight fled to the vast desert. There was no sound, the heaven and earth were lonely, and as far as the eye could see, there was no end. After the loneliness, ten thousand feelings surged. Every day, there must be countless new thoughts, rising and falling suddenly, unable to restrain himself. In the lonely shadow of a person where there are no human voices, he suddenly opened up the secret store of nature and obtained incredible insights. The sun rises and sets, the birds return, all kinds of colors appear in his eyes, and his heart must float a new thought because of it. A lonely moon shines on the sand, and the four directions are brilliant. The cool wind winnows the sand, forming wave lines, moving and surging without rest. Sometimes a storm rages, and towering sand pillars stand up in the empty sky in the hundreds. Suddenly the wind stops, the stars are brilliant, and a refreshing atmosphere suddenly arises, as if listening to the subtle music of the sky in the air, thinking that this joy is something he has never encountered in his life, and the joy is not enough for outsiders to know." It can be seen that there is a special interest in the deserted and uninhabited realm. There is a barren beach in Taihu Lake, about several acres in size, called Beigui, on which there is a Yu Wang Temple, with only ten or so rooms, the courtyard is full of lush trees, and in the middle stands a pole, about ten or so feet high, for hanging flags. The temple keeper, surnamed Li, has lived here for several generations. When the food is exhausted, he will hang a flag, and fishing boats will come to send supplies. When I arrived at Beigui, I strolled on the beach, and saw the sails and sand birds, vast and boundless. The sunlight shone on the water, shooting out golden light, dazzling to the eyes for dozens of miles around. The scenery was strange and beautiful, indescribable. Sitting quietly on the beach for a while, I had all sorts of thoughts, which were similar to the situation of the Egyptian knight. It is a pity that the temple keeper, surnamed Li, has not studied and missed this wonderful realm of the world.

### How to Improve Shanghai's City Telephone Service

— Ping

— Excerpts from Director Yu's speech at Jiaotong University

The history of telephones in Shanghai began in the seventh year of Emperor Guangxu's reign during the late Qing Dynasty. A British firm, Ruiji Foreign Company, established the China and Foreign Telephone Company in the former International Settlement, using magneto and common battery switchboards successively. However, there were instances of cross-border telephone lines. In the thirty-second year of Guangxu's reign, the Qing Dynasty's Minister in charge of Telecommunications Affairs established the Shanghai Telephone Bureau in the Nanshi area to safeguard sovereignty. It was established in the thirty-third year of Guangxu's reign, using magneto telephones. In the first year of Emperor Xuantong's reign, the Zhabei branch bureau was added. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, preparations were made to construct the Shanghai-Nanjing long-distance telephone service, with branches in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong. In the eighth year, land was purchased, and the China Electric Company was selected to handle various equipment and materials. The Nanshi branch was upgraded to a common battery exchange with a capacity of 2,000 lines. The Zhabei branch bureau used a magneto exchange with a capacity of 700 lines, and the Pudong branch bureau used a magneto exchange with a capacity of 280 lines. In the ninth year, the Shanghai Jiu Ji Construction Factory was selected to build the buildings. In the tenth year, a female telephone operator training school was established to train telephone operators, graduating in six months. At the same time, internal and external engineering work began. In the eleventh year, telephone service commenced. In the fourteenth year, a connection contract was signed with the China and Foreign Telephone Company. In the fifteenth year, connection began in February. In the nineteenth year, the company was sold to the current American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company, which switched to rotary automatic telephones. At the same time, in order to develop Shanghai's telephone service, the National Government ordered 4,800 lines of step-by-step automatic switching equipment from the American Automatic Electric Company, installing 3,000 lines in the Nanshi bureau, rebuilding the Zhabei branch bureau with 1,500 lines, and adding a city center branch bureau with 300 lines. The installation was completed and telephone service was available in the twenty-second year. Temporary contracts and long-distance contracts were signed with the Shanghai Telephone Company successively. During the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to the enemy and puppet regimes relocating and damaging the equipment in Nanshi and Zhabei, a step-by-step automatic telephone bureau was added in Hongkou. Currently, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is making every effort to restore them.

The current telephone institutions in Shanghai are one state-owned and one operated by foreign merchants, as mentioned above. The organizations of the two are different, and the systems vary. This not only causes difficulties in management, but also is not in accordance with economic principles, which makes it difficult for the telephone efficiency in this city to be perfect. Citizens cannot enjoy satisfactory service. In order to remedy the above shortcomings, improve telephone efficiency, and rationalize the city's telephone system, it seems necessary to have a unified management organization to be more appropriate. The establishment of this organization can be achieved through the following four methods: (1) The telephone institution operated by foreign merchants in Shanghai should be recovered by the Chinese government with its own funds and operated by the state. (2) All telephone services in Shanghai should be operated by foreign merchants. (3) China and the United States should jointly invest and organize a special limited company in accordance with Chinese law. (4) China and the United States should cooperate and operate and improve separately within their prescribed business areas.

Among them, the first method may be difficult to achieve in the short term given the current period of national financial constraints. The second method concerns China's sovereignty and is not suitable for discussion. Although the third method, where China and the United States jointly invest and organize a limited liability company in accordance with Chinese law, has the advantages of unified organization, uniform procedures, ease of expansion, and uniform and fair user fees, it is still difficult to implement under the current situation and will take a long time. Therefore, the results may not be as quick as the fourth method of Sino-US cooperation.

Now, based on my limited knowledge, I will list the fourth method of Sino-US cooperation in detail as follows: (A) Method: China and the United States should cooperate separately within their prescribed business areas. (B) Business rights: The Chinese government should allow the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company to continue operating the city telephone service in the former International Settlement and the former French Concession for a certain number of years after reorganization in accordance with Chinese law, and should issue another license in accordance with the Regulations for the Establishment of Private City Telephone Services promulgated by the Ministry of Communications. (C) Temporary contract: The temporary contract signed on April 19 of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities should be cancelled after this method is formulated. The company should immediately transfer all areas mentioned in the contract where roads were built across the border to the Ministry of Communications, which will be used as part of the business area of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau under its jurisdiction. (D) Equipment program: In order to unify the telephone machine program in Shanghai and show cooperation, the Ministry of Communications may relocate the existing step-by-step automatic telephone keys of the Telecommunications Bureau and the common battery manual telephone machines in the area where roads were built across the border to other places for application. All rotary automatic machines should be used uniformly in this city area. (E) Intercommunication of telephones: When users of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and users of the American-owned telephone company communicate with each other by city telephone, the automatic direct dial method should be used completely, and both parties should adhere to the principle of not charging users additional fees. (F) Long-distance telephone connection fee: The company can allow users to directly pay the long-distance telephone fee to the Telecommunications Bureau, or the company can collect the outgoing call bill sent by the Telecommunications Bureau on a monthly basis as an obligation and transfer the full amount of the fee to the Telecommunications Bureau. (G) Filing: The company should be filed with the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of China, and registered with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Commercial activities are subject to the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, business activities are subject to the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Communications, and road construction projects are subject to the supervision and guidance of the Shanghai Municipal Government. (H) Business period: The company's business period and the Ministry of Communications' supervision of the company and the methods for its nationalization shall be handled in accordance with the Regulations for the Establishment of Private City Telephone Services promulgated by the Ministry of Communications and future amendments.

Looking at the above four methods, if the first and third methods cannot be realized temporarily, then for the convenience of citizens and to improve the efficiency of telephone communication, the fourth method of Sino-US cooperation seems to be of value for adoption. As for how to learn from each other's strengths and overcome weaknesses in order to improve Shanghai's telephone business, it still depends on the great teachings of the relevant authorities and domestic talents.

### Development of Domestic Telegraph Business in Shanghai After the War

— Gao Changshun

"Messages travel thousands of miles in an instant, making the ends of the earth feel like neighbors." Telecommunications is valued for its speed and convenience. During wartime, it coordinates operations and assumes the mission of liaison and command. In peacetime, it communicates culture and promotes social prosperity. If telecommunications were to stop for even one day, news would be isolated, culture would be blocked, and the entire country would be in an unimaginable situation. Therefore, its position in national defense and cultural economy is very important and is becoming increasingly significant with the progress of the times. Since the victory, everything has been revived, and how can we dare to lag behind in the revitalization of our telecommunications industry? Therefore, I have listed the progress of the bureau's telegraph business in the past two years. By observing the present and recalling the past, we can encourage future development.

(1) Substantial replenishment of the interior

When the bureau took over the enemy's and puppet's China Central Electric Communication Company, the original equipment before the war was destroyed. The equipment taken over was mostly dilapidated and simple. After active repairs and a large number of additions, the equipment has increased three to five times compared to the time of takeover, and the number of circuits has increased three to six times.

Regarding wire telegraphy: Currently, the bureau's wire direct circuits reach as far as North China and South China. All branch lines during the war were almost completely destroyed. During the enemy's and puppet's China Central period, wire telegraphy circuits were limited to the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou triangle area. Therefore, since the beginning of the takeover, planning and dispatching have been carried out, and additions have been made gradually. There are currently nine Wheatstone automatic telegraph lines, three sound telegraph lines, and eight voice transmission circuits, totaling twenty circuits. However, due to the fact that the war is not yet over, it is difficult to restore the old appearance for a while. Moreover, although the Hankou and Xuzhou lines have been repaired, they are still damaged from time to time. Therefore, most telegraph business relies on the maintenance of wireless circuits.

Regarding wireless telegraphy: After the war, the bureau's wireless telegraph business developed rapidly. All major cities and towns, as far as all parts of the country, are connected. However, wireless communication is not as stable as wired communication due to the influence of climate and interference. Moreover, the telegraph business is heavy, often exceeding its own capacity. It is necessary to open up two or three more circuits to divert the traffic. Therefore, many wireless circuits have been added. There are eight automatic telegraph lines and twenty-three manual telegraph lines, totaling thirty-one circuits, which is a world of difference compared to the few during the enemy's and puppet's time.

In addition, various latest equipment have been added, such as facsimile machines, teletypewriters, and new wave receivers, which are the most modern communication tools.

(2) Enhance work efficiency

During the Anti-Japanese War, whether in the rear or in the occupied areas, it sometimes took a long time to transmit a telegram. In the early days of the victory, telegram delays and errors were also common. Now telegrams can be delivered smoothly throughout the country. In terms of quantity: Before the war, the daily incoming and outgoing telegrams of this bureau were only a few thousand, but now there are sometimes as many as 30,000 or more. Recently, wireless automatic telegraph circuits are being added one after another to increase the transmission capacity of telegrams. In terms of speed: The time limit for the transmission of various telegrams is also stipulated. Express telegrams can arrive in just one and a half hours. Even ordinary telegrams are required to be delivered within six hours in direct circuits. As for accuracy, the accuracy rate is much higher than during the war. The average error percentage is only 0.115%. In order to eliminate telegram errors, the proofreading work has now been strengthened. Special personnel have been assigned to check the original telegraphs for incoming and transferred telegrams every day, in order to ensure accuracy.

(3) Expanding public services

After the victory, the communication and transportation between Shanghai and other places became increasingly important. The bureau worked hard to achieve progress in an extremely difficult environment with a lack of equipment and manpower, under the goal of "serving the public" and "facilitating customers." Therefore, in terms of business, express telegrams were opened to meet urgent needs, communication telegrams and gift vouchers were restored to facilitate social interaction, travel telegrams were available to facilitate travel, and night letter telegrams were economical and practical for the public to choose from. Regarding convenience for customers: In addition to actively adding 19 branch offices and agency offices, telegraph kiosks were set up at train stations, wharves, and major transportation routes. There is also a mobile telegraph office that drives around the city so that citizens can send telegrams anytime and anywhere. In order to provide more thorough service, a public service counter is set up in the business office, and in order to improve the speed of telegram delivery and facilitate registered users, six-digit registration is implemented. In addition, telephone telegrams and telephone notification of telegram collection are held, and free translation of incoming telegrams are all considered for the public. Moreover, business inspectors often answer questions from all parties and visit users to solicit opinions in order to seek improvement.

Today's telegraph business, although there are some achievements, it is still not satisfactory. I hope that the people of the country will cooperate more to achieve perfection.

### Before and After the Opening of China-UK Wireless Telephone Service

— Si Sheng

Preparation situation: China and the United Kingdom have very close relations in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, and the cooperative promotion of the friendly spirit between the two countries depends on telecommunications. Therefore, the opening of China-UK wireless telephone service has great significance. As early as the spring of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications contacted the British Post Office General Administration to open wireless telephone services and actively made preparations. Unexpectedly, just as it was preparing to make the call, the August 13th Incident occurred. Due to damage to equipment and the relocation of the radio station to the west, the telephone service was suspended.

After the victory, with the cooperation of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the International Radio Station, telephone service between China and the United States was first restored on July 1. On the one hand, new single-sideband wireless telephone sets were ordered from abroad to be transported to Shanghai. On the other hand, trial calls between China and the United Kingdom began daily from February 3 of this year. Both sides used dual-channel single-sideband, which can open two telephone channels simultaneously. Therefore, the sound quality is extremely clear. In order to prevent special changes in the atmospheric pressure in the sky or lack of smoothness, it is planned to add a 30KW dual-channel single-sideband high-power amplifier to increase the output power from two kilowatts to thirty kilowatts to facilitate telephone calls.

Equipment characteristics: In order to connect long-distance wireless telephones to ordinary two-wire wired telephones, special wiring equipment must be used to fully express the communication efficiency of this barrier-free telephone. There must be receiving and transmitting stations at considerable distances at both ends of the wireless telephone. This wireless circuit is divided into receiving and transmitting circuits, each of which is equivalent to the two wires of a wired circuit, so there are four wires. The function of the terminal machine can restore it to two wires, which can be connected to ordinary telephone users.

Because wireless telephones are more complex than wired telephones, the branch coil device commonly used in wired circuits is not sufficient for wireless circuits, and wireless terminal equipment must be used. The terminal machine has an automatic voice current adjustment device. Although the user's voice is different, it can still adjust the uniform volume and transmit it to the wireless transmitter for transmission. There is also a set of relays that can be controlled by the voice of telephone users, so that any echo or call in the entire voice channel can be avoided.

The terminal machine also has an automatic volume controller (referred to as "VOGAD") and an automatic call reduction controller (referred to as "VODAS"). The above-mentioned automatic call reduction controller is a secret equipment shared by receiving and transmitting. The function of this secret equipment is to change the voice radio waves so that anyone else listening to wireless telephones cannot hear clearly.

Telephone ceremony: The China-UK telephone ceremony was held on March 4 in the conference room of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau at Xujiahui. Two huge Chinese and British flags were hung in the center of the venue, and small Chinese and British national flags were hung on the four walls. At 5:30, the ceremony began. First, Director Yu gave a speech, and then Mr. Lu, the Management Engineer of the International Radio Station, reported on the preparation process. Then, Mayor Wu talked with Smith, the Mayor of London and the current Chairman of the London Chamber of Commerce. After the two mayors ended their call, Mayor Wu talked with Mr. Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom. After that, the call was connected to Sir Bowes, the leader of the British business delegation who had previously visited Shanghai. Mayor Wu had a pleasant conversation with Mr. Bowes. The humorous and relaxed tone won laughter from the whole audience. (See various local newspapers on March 5 for details.) Then, Mr. Gillett, the British Consul General in Shanghai, talked with Mr. Tan, the Chinese Consul General in London. Finally, Director Yu talked with the Director of the Telecommunications Division of the British Post Office General Administration. The entire ceremony was thus completed.

Telephone time, location, and price

Currently, the telephone locations are temporarily set to Shanghai, Nanjing, and various places in Britain and Northern Ireland. The telephone time is tentatively set to 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM Shanghai time (9:30 AM to 11:30 AM Greenwich Mean Time). Telephone service is closed on Sundays. International telephone calls are charged in gold francs. Currently, one gold franc is equivalent to 49,500 yuan in national currency. The price of China-UK telephone calls is set at 36 gold francs for the first three minutes, which is equivalent to 1,746,000 yuan in national currency, and 12 gold francs per minute for overtime, which is equivalent to 582,000 yuan in national currency. The cancellation fee is 2.4 gold francs, which is equivalent to 118,800 yuan in national currency.

### Telecommunications Knowledge Talk (9)

— Zhang Jiayu

Lecture 3 How to choose special services (continued)

(8) Personal Delivery: Usually, when we send letters with more important or confidential content, we often add the words "Personal Delivery" under the name of the recipient on the envelope; the purpose of writing these two words is nothing more than to hope that the recipient will open and read it himself. However, the post office still delivers it as usual and does not have the obligation to deliver it to the recipient in person, nor does it charge additional fees. The "Personal Delivery" special service in telegrams is slightly different from postal letters. For telegrams with "Personal Delivery" or =MP= fee identification noted at the beginning of the telegram by the sender, the receiving telegraph office should write "Personal Delivery" or "Personal Delivery" on the telegram envelope when delivering it, and may instruct the messenger delivering the telegram to deliver it to the recipient in person as much as possible. At the very least, the telegram must be delivered only after a stamp (or signature) with the same name as the recipient is affixed to the return receipt. In addition to adding an =MP= fee identification before the recipient's name and address, the "Personal Delivery" special service does not charge any other fees.

(9) Open Delivery: After receiving telegrams from various places, the telegraph office is required to seal the telegram envelope before delivering it to the messenger in order to maintain the confidentiality of communication. If the sender wants to send a telegram that is extremely time-sensitive but does not need to be kept confidential, he can add an "Open Delivery" or =OPEN= fee identification at the beginning of the telegram. After receiving this telegram, the receiving telegraph office will deliver it without sealing it. In this way, if the recipient happens to be away from home when the telegram is delivered, his family or co-residents can receive and handle it on his behalf, so that the opportunity will not be delayed by waiting for the recipient to come back to open and read it himself. In addition to adding an =OPEN= fee identification, the "Open Delivery" special service does not charge any other fees.

(10) Poste Restante: Telegrams sent to passers-by who do not have a fixed address can be sent to the local telegraph office or post office to be kept for the recipient to pick up himself, if the sender and receiver agree on this in advance. The "Poste Restante" special service is divided into "Telegraph Poste Restante" (identification =TR=), "Postal Poste Restante" (identification =GP=), and "Registered Poste Restante" (identification =GPR=) according to three different processing methods. The receiving telegraph office handles telegrams using the "Poste Restante" special service as follows:

"Telegraph Poste Restante" keeps the telegram in the business office of the receiving telegraph office, waiting for the recipient or his representative to come to the office to pick it up. If it is not picked up after forty-two days, the original telegram will be destroyed.

"Postal Poste Restante" "Registered Poste Restante" The receiving telegraph office sends the former by ordinary mail and the latter by registered mail to the local post office for storage, waiting for the recipient or his representative to pick it up at the post office. The storage period is handled in accordance with the regulations of the post office.

For telegrams using the "Poste Restante" special service, in addition to adding the fee identification specified above, "Postal Poste Restante" should be charged ordinary mail postage according to the regulations of the post office, "Registered Poste Restante" should be charged registered mail postage, and "Telegraph Poste Restante" is not charged separately.

(11) Telephone Delivery: Telegrams sent to recipients who have telephones installed in the local area can use the telephone number instead of the recipient's address. For example, the telephone number in my office is 11130, so telegrams sent to me from various places can also be written as "TELEPHONE 11130 Shanghai = Zhang Jiayu." After receiving this telegram, the Shanghai Telegraph Office will first find out the address of the telephone subscriber "11130" from the telephone directory, and then deliver it to the address. However, if the sender hopes that after this telegram arrives in Shanghai, the telegraph office will first transmit the content of the telegram to the recipient by telephone, and then have the messenger deliver the telegram, just add a =TF= (telephone delivery) identification before the telephone number and the recipient's name, and the telegraph office can do so.

In addition to the eleven special services mentioned above, there is also a "Postal Delivery" special service, but it does not apply to domestic telegrams, so I will not discuss it here. (End of Lecture 3)

### Reward for Reporting Secret Radio Stations

— Yong

We recently saw news in the newspapers that the military and police authorities had cracked down on privately operated radio stations. The telecommunications bureau has indeed put a lot of thought into it. It has repeatedly stated that the organization of these privately operated radio stations is an act that undermines the country's transportation business and violates the transportation and telecommunications regulations, and should be severely punished by the national law. However, these people who disregard government laws and ignore commercial ethics are still doing it secretly, which is very regrettable.

In order to eliminate these privately operated radio stations that specialize in commercial telegrams, the telecommunications bureau has specially allocated a bonus to reward military and police authorities or individuals or organizations that report the radio stations. The telecommunications bureau guarantees to keep the name and address of the informant strictly confidential.

Thanks to the past cooperation of the military and police authorities in this city, the telecommunications authorities have been able to carry out this work smoothly. Undoubtedly, we must continue to work hard in the future to thoroughly eliminate these illegal privately operated radio stations, and the cooperation of people from all walks of life is the main factor in the success of this work.

### Reply to a Citizen of Caojing

Thank you for reporting that Mr. Longshun Rice Shop, the operator of public telephone No. 67 in Caohejing, overcharged 15,000 yuan for each call! We have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and found that Shengyuan Rice and Flower Factory, the operator of public telephone No. 69, also has the same situation. In accordance with the regulations, we have severely warned them separately and suspended telephone service for five days in rotation (No. 67 from March 16 to 20, No. 69 from March 11 to 15) to punish them. If there is any further overcharging, the machine will be dismantled. As for the reason for the overcharging stated in the letter, it involves the bureau's operators and field mechanics asking for monthly rules. After inquiring, the operators firmly denied it, or it was a misunderstanding and not a fact. Thank you for your assistance and friendship. We hope that you will continue to give us your opinions so that we can improve!
