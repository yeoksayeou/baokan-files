### After the Third Reading in the Hong Kong Legislative Council, the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement Case is Successfully Passed; the First Reading of the Order Maintenance Bill is Passed

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th] At a meeting of the Hong Kong Legislative Council on the 20th, it was proposed to hold the second and third readings of the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement Bill. This important agreement between the two governments of China and Hong Kong in recent years was completed with the final legislative procedures. The case was proposed by Colonial Secretary McDougall and read for the second time at a regular meeting of the Legislative Council. The result of the three discussions was a unanimous vote in favor. It is reported that the first reading of the case was completed two weeks ago. It is further learned that the agreement will take effect as soon as the representative of our customs in Hong Kong and the local authorities have agreed on the measures. Regarding this matter, reliable sources have learned that Dong Le, the Commissioner of Customs of our Kowloon Customs (who was previously summoned back to Shanghai), will remain here to supervise the implementation of the agreement. Mr. Dong indirectly confirmed his new mission yesterday, saying that he had a special duty to stay in Hong Kong. It is reported that the Sino-Hong Kong government signed an agreement in January of this year to prevent smuggling in the waters off southern China. However, due to differences of opinion on the issue of territorial waters for the activities of our customs patrol ships, the agreement was not fully implemented. At the beginning of this month, Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration of our Ministry of Finance, was sent to Hong Kong to negotiate with the local authorities, and the differences were resolved. The agreement was originally scheduled to expire in January next year. It has now been agreed that the agreement will be valid for another full year today, and it is stipulated that notice should be given three months before the expiration date.

[This newspaper's Hong Kong dispatch on the 20th] The Hong Kong Legislative Council passed the first reading of the Order Maintenance Bill to prevent political groups from using violence in Hong Kong to achieve their political goals.

### The Situation in Northeast China is Turning Around; The National Army Steadily and Surely Captures the Main Force of the Communists; Fierce Street Fighting is Still Going on in Changchun

[This newspaper's Shenyang dispatch on the 20th] How the situation in Northeast China is changing is of great concern to the people of the country. At the same time, they are also very concerned about the Changchun incident. However, according to what this reporter knows, the central government and the local authorities are working hard to turn the situation for the better and are determined to make it happen. The war in the Northeast has been slightly quiet for the past two days. According to evidence from various sources, the National Army's strategy has shifted to steadily and surely capturing the main force of the communists, and the gains and losses of towns have become less important. The attack on Heishan by the Shenyang westward advance corps has also been temporarily suspended, seemingly waiting for a favorable opportunity. The mopping-up work around Xinlitun has not stopped. The 5th and 6th Columns of the communists have fled westward to Fuxin. The 11th Column is also fleeing in a southwest direction to Fuxin, seemingly to prevent the National Army from attacking Fuxin. They have now been forced by the National Army to the Xinchi area in eastern Fuxin. On the Tasha front in western Liaoning, the communists are still doing their best to prevent the National Army from advancing eastward. In addition to the 4th, 7th, and part of the 11th Columns fighting against the National Army, the 3rd Column has also fled from Jinzhou to the Yinqiao area to prevent the strength of the National Army. According to reports, in addition to continuing to attack the communists in the area west of Tasha, the National Army is also moving part of its forces westward, pointing to Xingcheng and Suizhong, in order to open up contact with Shanhaiguan. The Air Force at the Shenyang base has been continuously flying reconnaissance and bombing missions to the west of Liaoning, Jinzhou, and Beizhen to make arrangements for the National Army.

[This newspaper's Shenyang dispatch on the 20th] The National Army's westward advance corps crossed into the Daohao on the 18th and pressed towards Heishan.

[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 20th] The situation in the Northeast will soon have new developments. Du Yuming has been shuttling between Shenyang, Huludao, Beiping, and Qianyangugudi in recent days, arranging military affairs, and is extremely busy. The great battle in western Liaoning is about to begin.

[This newspaper's Huludao dispatch on the 20th] The communist army in Jinzhou is preventing refugees from leaving the city, and all tall buildings have been turned to ashes. A part of the National Army that broke through has reached the Nü'er River and will soon make contact with the eastward advancing troops. More than 100 captured communists have been escorted to Huludao. According to them, the artillerymen in the communist army are all Russian communists, and the drivers are mostly from a certain country. The battle on Tasha Mountain intensified again on the evening of the 19th.

[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 20th] The Pingming Daily's telegram from Shenyang today said: After the situation in Jinzhou became unclear, the director of the Northeast Suppression General Political Committee's office in Jinzhou and Zhang Zuoxiang were said to have been captured while visiting Jinzhou to sweep tombs. Another report: There are two theories about Fan Hanjie and Lu Jun's capture and breakthrough, but officials have not confirmed either.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] The Northeast Suppression General Headquarters recently released the Changchun battle report: After Zeng Zesheng, the commander of the 60th Army of the Changchun garrison troops, was captured on the 17th, his troops were surrounded and disarmed by the communists. As a result, the positions in the eastern urban area were also occupied by the communists. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Dong Guoguo led the New 7th Army in a fierce battle with the communists in the defense area of the western urban area. Up to 6:00 a.m. this morning, the Suppression General Headquarters received a telegram from Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zheng, requesting it to be forwarded to the President, which read: The New 7th Army has suffered heavy casualties and has transferred its positions, taking the Central Bank as its base. We are upholding the spirit of revolutionary sacrifice, vowing to shed our last drop of blood to repay the Party and the country, and will never fail to live up to the heavy responsibilities entrusted to us by Your Excellency. Fierce street fighting is still going on.

[Telegram] Military sources: After the communist army in Changchun broke into the urban area on the 18th, fierce fighting continued on the 19th and 20th. The communists desperately attacked from the Central Building in the city center, but were all blocked by the National Army. At dawn today, our air force flew in to assist in the battle, and the communist forces were said to have been frustrated.

### John Leighton Stuart's Friendly Appeal is Inspiring to the Five Nationalities; President Weng Expresses Gratification in His Speech

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 20th] News Bureau News: Executive Yuan President Weng issued a statement on the afternoon of the 20th, saying: After reading the newspaper report, I was deeply moved by the sympathy and goodwill of American friends for our country in the speech made by John Leighton Stuart, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, after returning to the United States. He recognized that China is struggling hard under difficult conditions due to the communist insurgency, and also explained that our government authorities are sincerely rectifying the economy in order to be competent for the difficult work of this era. Therefore, he believed that the amount of aid to China should be increased and the period must be extended. This kind of opinion is very consistent with the actual situation. The Chinese people of all nationalities are inspired by this friendly appeal. What I would like the friends of the world to understand together is that there are not only military actions in China, but also economic struggles. Since the currency reform, the credibility of the gold yuan has been remarkable, and the market conditions have suddenly stabilized. Unfortunately, the Communist Party has strengthened its economic attacks. They have freely raised the price of gold in North China in order to seize gold bars, so the black market gold price in Tianjin is the highest in the country, and other places have also been affected. They also spare no expense to grab grain at high prices, so the already stable market has been fluctuated again, and the cities of Pingjin have felt a grain shortage. The government is taking appropriate and effective measures to deal with this phenomenon with all its strength, but the government's work has become more difficult. Therefore, the more aid from the United States increases, the more the government's strength to stabilize the economy and help the people increases. John Leighton Stuart and his colleagues who came to China have always had a sympathetic understanding and sincere assistance attitude towards our country, and the Chinese colleagues have always been very fortunate. I would like to declare this, especially to clarify it.

Editorial

### Looking at America's Foreign Policy from the Perspective of American Aid

Recently, American public opinion, due to the expansion of the communist bandit rebellion within China and the increasingly profound red danger in Southeast Asia, has expressed much criticism of the US government regarding the issue of American military and economic aid to China. In order to clarify public opinion, the State Department issued a "Report on Aid to China" on the 11th, stating that in terms of military aid to China, the United States has transferred 88 million US dollars to the Chinese government to purchase firearms, ammunition, aircraft, military tires, and radios in the United States; it also pointed out that in terms of economic aid, the United States has also shipped food and other economic materials worth 98 million US dollars to China.

Just looking at the figures released in this report, it seems that American military and economic aid to China cannot but be considered very active. However, on the other hand, China, the recipient of aid, always feels that American aid is "a verbal promise that does not materialize." In the past six months, how much help has the American aid material shipped to China been for our country's military and economic needs? It is impossible not to feel a sense of "a cup of water on a cart of firewood, of no avail." What is the reason for this? According to officials from our country stationed in Washington, most of the American aid materials have not been shipped to China. This is an undeniable fact, and there is no need to explain it further. Even in the American government and public, they cannot deny this fact. For example, the American Howard newspaper published an editorial on the 13th of this month, discussing the issue of American aid. In addition to speaking out loudly for China, it also spoke the truth about the United States. A paragraph in the newspaper's editorial stated: "When the Kuomintang had not yet reached an agreement with the Communist Party, the United States stopped and cancelled the 500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank to China; while the Soviet Union was supplying the captured Japanese army with equipment to the Communist army, the United States prohibited the shipment of military supplies to China; now the Chinese Air Force urgently needs gasoline, but the gasoline shipped to China by the United States is less than that shipped to France; the Chinese government originally hoped to purchase enough equipment to equip ten divisions, but in reality, China can only purchase enough equipment to equip less than one division; the United States has already sold the remaining military supplies to Greece and Turkey, so that China cannot purchase cheap military supplies on the market."

From this article, we can not only see the reasons for the slow pace of American aid to China, but also suddenly realize that the current American government's view of the situation in Asia and China has not changed much in essence. The concept of "Europe first, Asia second" is deeply rooted and remains a major factor dominating American foreign policy. In the eyes of the gentlemen in the US State Department, it still seems that they only see the seriousness of the European situation, only know that the Berlin crisis is enough to threaten world peace, only foresee and feel that the communist forces are advancing towards Western Europe every day, and completely ignore the crisis of Asia being reddened. The division of North and South Korea; the active communist forces in various countries in East and West Asia have almost turned Southeast Asia into a living hell of red terror; China, as the pillar of Asian security, looks at the domestic situation, which is also fraught with dangers. Under the support of the Communist International, the flames of rebellion of the communist bandits will burn all over half of China. All of these points seem to be still viewed indifferently in the minds of the current American authorities, unaware of the impending disaster. Taking the issue of aid to China as an example, when the US Congress discussed this matter last year, it was said that "Heaven helps those who help themselves." There is no problem with American aid to China, but to this day, China is striving for reform and progress in politics, military affairs, economy, and society every day. However, this currency system reform has never received good reviews from the United States since February, nor has it promoted the active aid to China from the American government, which makes friends who truly care about China unable to express regret. Mr. Walter Lippmann's article "Winning the War and Losing the Peace" can be regarded as a correct critique of American foreign policy towards China by American friends.

In short, the development of the Asian situation and the deterioration of the Chinese crisis have made the United States have to re-examine its policy towards China. However, judging from Secretary of State Marshall's new plan for the Cold War with the Soviet Union, which plans to have a showdown with the Soviet Union in Europe next spring and adopt a defensive posture in Asia, it can be seen that Marshal Marshall is still sticking to the outdated concept of "Europe first, Asia second." If this policy is still adopted by the new American political theories in the future, the United States will surely make a historical mistake. Mr. Walter Lippmann's warning: "The European continent and the Far East will fall into the hands of Stalin," I am afraid it may also become a reality!

### The Executive Yuan Passed a Resolution to Establish Special Criminal Courts in Provinces and Cities to Expand the Scope of Implementation of Emergency Punishment

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 20th] The case of implementing the "Emergency Punishment Act for Endangering the Country during the Suppression of Rebellion" and establishing higher special criminal courts has been passed in the Executive Yuan meeting on the 20th. According to the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Order, cases of violation of price control, if the circumstances are serious, have been telegraphed by the Executive Yuan to the provincial and municipal governments, ordering them to be transferred to the Special Criminal Court in accordance with the "Emergency Punishment Act for Endangering the Country during the Suppression of Rebellion" for severe punishment. However, the scope of implementation of the regulations was originally stipulated by the National Government by order, and the former National Government authorized the Executive Yuan to designate martial law areas and the capital, Shanghai, Wuhan and other twenty-four places to establish higher special criminal courts. In other areas, not only are there no higher special criminal courts to hear cases, but the application of the regulations is also groundless. The case has been reviewed by the Executive Yuan inviting relevant agencies to hold meetings and discuss it. It has been decided that (1) to expand the scope of implementation of the "Emergency Punishment Act for Endangering the Country during the Suppression of Rebellion", (2) to establish additional higher special criminal courts, in addition to the 24 established locations, higher special criminal courts shall be established in the locations of the higher courts or higher branch courts of all provinces and cities, that is, within the respective higher courts or their branch courts. The personnel below the chief prosecutor of the court or its branch court shall be concurrently held by the personnel of the local court, and only in places where there are many cases, a small number of prosecutors and clerks shall be added, and office expenses shall be appropriately increased. As for the organization of the higher special criminal courts in the military mobile areas in the front line, and the exercise of their powers, etc., the Ministry of Judicial Administration shall properly handle in consultation with the Ministry of National Defense. (3) The issue of amending the "Emergency Punishment Act for Endangering the Country during the Suppression of Rebellion" will not be amended at this time.

### Revolt Erupts in Yeosu, South Korea; 1,000 Police Officers Occupy the City Police Station; Communist Agitation; Government Adopts Emergency Measures; Moscow Radio Announces Soviet Troops Begin Withdrawal from North Korea

[Central News Agency, Seoul Dispatch, 20th] One thousand out of 2,500 Korean police officers stationed in Yeosu, the southernmost point of the Korean Peninsula, revolted this morning. A senior official of the Korean government claimed: The rebellion is currently spreading, but the government has taken necessary actions. The 2,500-man detachment stationed in Yeosu was originally scheduled to go to Jeju Island to suppress local rebels led by the Communists. The 1,000 rebels have occupied the Yeosu Police Station. It is said that 800 of them are still resisting the railway police twelve miles north of Yeosu.

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul Dispatch, 20th] According to information here, 3,000 security guards revolted in Yeosu, a railroad terminus with a population of one million at the extreme south of Korea, on the night of the 19th, attacking and occupying the city's police force. Southern Korean government officials believe that the police force's rebellion was caused by Communist infiltration and incitement. At present, the rebellion has developed northward and has spread to the Suncheon area. Due to the extremely serious nature of this rebellion, the South Korean Ministry of Internal Affairs refused to allow any foreign reporters to release information about the matter.

[Associated Press, Seoul Dispatch, 20th] President Syngman Rhee convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the 20th to deal with the Communist rebellion in the South. President Rhee is expected to declare martial law immediately. It is generally believed that he will also request the assistance of the US troops stationed in South Korea to suppress the rebellion. According to a report from the Security Bureau, the rebels' goal is to overthrow the government. During Rhee's visit to Japan, US military commander General Coulter stated: This is an internal Korean matter, and the US military does not intend to interfere except to ensure the property and safety of the occupation forces. Unofficial reports claim that the rebellion was launched by leftists and Communist elements who had infiltrated the South Korean security forces. The rebellion happened just as President Rhee returned from his visit to Japan. At the same time, Moscow Radio announced that Soviet troops have begun to withdraw from North Korea according to plan. It is also learned that although Soviet troops had withdrawn from several border strongholds a few days ago, they have been taken over by about 200,000 North Korean troops.

### Syngman Rhee Believes That South Korea Can Handle Everything After the Soviet Withdrawal from North Korea; Investment in Korean Mining Is Not Welcome at Present

[Central News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch, 20th] President Syngman Rhee of Korea summoned Allied and Korean-Japanese reporters this morning. He said: The people of South Korea have no worries about the expansion of communism or communists in Korea. Regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea, Rhee said: Now that the Soviet army has withdrawn from North Korea, we can solve the problem ourselves without bloodshed. When a reporter asked whether South Korea was strong enough to resist Communist attacks, he said: South Korea's defense relies on the following points, namely: (1) the ability to mobilize; (2) material assistance from friendly countries.

Six months ago, Rhee said that he could mobilize 500,000 people to defend South Korea within six weeks, but he needed weapons and ammunition, and he also hoped that US troops would remain in South Korea. Regarding the issue of foreign investment, Rhee said that although the United States and China both intend to invest in the Korean mining industry, at present the Korean mining industry and public utilities do not accept foreign investment. He plans to nationalize gold mines and other company businesses, and will not accept foreign investment until the plan is mature. Rhee hopes to discuss trade between Korea and Japan with MacArthur during his short stay in Japan. He said that smuggling between China, Japan, and Korea hinders legitimate trade, and the smuggling of Korean rice into Japan has caused a food shortage in the country. Rhee also hopes to discuss the status of Korean residents in Japan with MacArthur. He said: Determining the status of Koreans can reduce the difficulties for Korea, Japan, and the Allied Powers.

### US-Korean Economic Agreement Is Currently Under Negotiation

[Central News Agency, Gyeongseong Dispatch, 20th] The US-Korean economic agreement negotiations, which have attracted much attention, are currently underway, and the content is not available. What is known is that the main points of the negotiations focus on the economic assistance that the United States will provide to Korea in the future. The draft agreement was prepared by the US side and has a total of ten articles, divided into several sub-items. Broadly speaking, Korea must pay an appropriate price for US assistance and make appropriate and planned use of it under the full supervision of the US side. The export of Korean products and import trade must also be subject to control, and assistance materials must not be re-exported. The implementation plan for the economic agreement will be based on the US-Korean agreement concluded when the US military government transferred power to the Korean government in the past. In addition, in order to smoothly promote the implementation plan in the future, the US side will send necessary personnel to stay in Korea. It is said that the US technical experts required for the economic assistance plan total 240 people, including technicians in the fields of electrical engineering, agriculture, industry, commerce, finance, and mining.

### Czechoslovakia Establishes Diplomatic Relations with North Korea; North Korea Exiles 50,000 Non-Communist People

[Central News Agency, Moscow Dispatch, 20th] Czechoslovakia has quickly established diplomatic relations with the North Korean regime, becoming the fourth country to recognize the regime. The Soviet Union, Outer Mongolia, and Poland have all announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with the regime, and the Soviet Union has appointed an ambassador to the regime.

[US Information Service, Seoul, 19th] According to reliable sources yesterday: The North Korean military authorities have exiled more than 50,000 police officers and non-Communist Koreans, who were forced to work in Yekaterinburg, Northeast China, and Siberia. It is said that this expansion of exile is part of a dual plan by the Soviet Union, on the one hand to punish Koreans who do not sympathize with the Democratic People's Republic led by the Soviet Union, and on the other hand to provide forced labor for various arduous tasks such as mining, logging, building roads, and fishing in remote and unsanitary areas under Soviet control.

### US-Soviet Agreements on Korea Have All Been Violated by the Soviets; Hodge Announces in Chicago

[Central News Agency, Chicago, 19th, Associated Press] General Hodge, former commander of the US military in Korea, told the Foreign Relations Association here today that since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has violated 16 of the 17 agreements made between the US and the Soviet Union on Korea.

### UN Political Committee Passes US Plan for Atomic Control; Further Study by Atomic Energy Commission

[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] The United Nations Political Committee passed the Western plan to control atomic energy by an overwhelming majority, considering it a necessary basis for effectively reducing atomic weapons. The Soviet bloc voted against it. The Political Committee voted on the Canadian proposal chapter by chapter, and finally, in a verbal vote, passed the proposal by a vote of 41 to 6, submitting the resolution to the General Assembly for a final formal adoption. The Political Committee first rejected a proposal put forward by the Soviet Union two weeks ago by a vote of 39 to 6. The Soviet Union demanded that the existing US atomic bombs be destroyed at the same time as the establishment of an international atomic energy control agency. Western countries rejected the Soviet plan, insisting that a strict system of international control and supervision must be established first, and then the United States would destroy all its atomic weapons. This is the first time the United Nations has had the opportunity to vote on this issue since Baruch put forward the US plan to the Atomic Energy Commission in June 1946. In the past, the atomic energy issue has only been discussed in the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Commission. Chapters 1 and 2 of the resolution, based on the US original plan, passed the report of the Atomic Energy Commission by a vote of 40 to 7, with nine abstentions. The Political Committee generally passed the third clause by a vote of 49 to 6, with two abstentions, expressing deep concern about the deadlock reached by the Atomic Energy Commission. Then, the Political Committee, by a vote of 46 to 7, requested the five major powers and Canada to consult informally and privately in an attempt to find a basis for an agreement on atomic energy and the elimination of atomic weapons, with four abstentions. Finally, the last chapter was passed by a vote of 43 to 6, requesting the Atomic Energy Commission to reconvene and continue to conduct "practical and effective" research, with seven abstentions. At the same time, the Political Committee rejected India's proposal by a vote of 23 to 6, with 21 abstentions. India's proposal requested the Atomic Energy Commission to continue its work and draft a treaty on the system as soon as possible. Ukrainian delegate Manuelsky expressed the Soviet view before the final vote, accusing the Canadian proposal of being a plan to permanently maintain the United States' exclusive possession of atomic energy. The Soviet Union and its satellite countries could not prevent the committee from making a decision, because the veto power could not be exercised in the committee. However, this vote can only express an authoritative opinion, and even if the proposal is passed by an overwhelming majority, it cannot make the world closer to solving this problem.

### Atomic Energy is Unbelievably Wonderful; Seawater Can Be Turned into Food

[US Information Service, New York, 19th] President Truman's special advisor on atomic energy, Baruch, said at the annual symposium of the New York Herald Tribune last night that if the Soviet leaders (not the Soviet people) have rejected the United States' ideal of preventing the threat of atomic destruction in the world, then we must continue to manufacture atomic weapons, but the fear of war should not prevent the peaceful use of atomic energy. He said that in the future, atomic energy may enable scientists to use sunlight and substances in seawater to make food. Baruch believes that atomic energy may even enable mankind to use seawater for irrigation to develop the sandy areas along the Mediterranean Sea.

### US Denies Considering Equipping Austrian Troops

[Central Agency for Eastern Affairs, Tokyo, 20th] The Tokyo High Court has taken another action in the investigation of the Showa Corporation bribery case.

Kusatsu served as the director of the Banking Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and is known as one of the leading figures in Japanese politics who is close to the Democratic Liberal Party.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in Arab-Jewish War After Security Council Orders Ceasefire; Political Committee Decides to Postpone Discussion of Holy Land Issue

[This newspaper's report] A broadcast from Paris on the 20th said: United Nations truce observers reported to the United Nations headquarters here that despite the ceasefire order issued by the Security Council, the two sides continued to shell each other on the Nitzanim front in southern Palestine.

### Behind-the-Scenes Activities in the Security Council to Resolve the Berlin Crisis; Neutral Countries Seeking Concrete Suggestions

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] After today's Security Council meeting, acting chairman Bramuglia met with Soviet representative Vyshinsky for 45 minutes. This morning, Bramuglia also met with French Foreign Minister Schuman. In addition, representatives from Britain and France, as well as representatives from the six neutral countries of the Security Council, are also scheduled to meet tonight. According to informed sources, since Bramuglia announced that the Security Council would meet again on the 22nd to discuss the final resolution of the Berlin issue, the behind-the-scenes activities in the past two or three days will inevitably become extremely busy. To date, the three Western Allied countries and the six neutral countries have no specific suggestions for resolving the Berlin issue. The Western countries seem not to hide their intention that concrete suggestions should best be put forward by the neutral countries, so the United Nations attaches great importance to the meetings of the six neutral countries.

### Shigeru Yoshida Urges All Countries for the First Time to Conclude a Peace Treaty with Japan As Soon As Possible; So That It Can Join International Organizations As Soon As Possible

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Prime Minister Yoshida indirectly requested an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan in order to resolve Japan's current difficulties. After taking office this afternoon, Yoshida made a statement to reporters, saying that Japan must rejoin international organizations as soon as possible, and he called on the Japanese people to work hard to promote democracy so that they can rejoin international organizations with dignity. Although he did not mention the peace treaty, he made it clear that he hoped to conclude the peace treaty as soon as possible, because Japan cannot participate in any international organization unless a peace treaty is concluded. Yoshida, like Katayama, will concurrently hold the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. He will thoroughly study diplomatic procedures in preparation for joining international organizations. He also called on the Japanese people to cooperate so that Japan can return to the international community with peace of mind.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Yoshida Cabinet of Japan held the Emperor's appointment ceremony in the palace at 5 pm on the 19th. Immediately afterwards, the first cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence. The most important agenda item was to review the various bills that the previous cabinet had handed over for discussion at the temporary parliament. However, because the Democratic Liberal Party was in the opposition at that time, most of the proposals and reasons formulated by the Democratic Party were revised. However, the recess period of the temporary parliament should not be delayed for too long. The first cabinet meeting decided to hold continuous meetings starting from the 21st in order to complete the proposals as soon as possible.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The newly appointed Prime Minister Yoshida of Japan announced the appointment of five people, including Eiichi, as private advisors who will work at the Prime Minister's official residence. The recently announced private advisors to the Prime Minister include Kiyoshiro Shidehara, Eijiro Uehara, Longfu Saito, Yuzo Shigemune, and Hidejiro Ohnogi. Takeshi Yamazaki, who was previously rumored to be hired as an advisor, is not included. It is worth noting whether this shows that Yoshida and Yamazaki have had disagreements due to the competition for the Prime Minister's nomination.

### A Fierce Debate in the Political Committee

[This newspaper's report] A broadcast from Paris on the 20th: A fierce debate took place in the United Nations Political Committee here over whether the entire Palestine issue should be discussed immediately. The Soviet bloc accused other countries of trying to postpone the discussion of the Palestine issue until after the US presidential election. The Cuban representative suggested replacing it with a resolution proposed by Mexico, requesting the five major powers to end the Cold War and cooperate for world peace. The Latin American bloc immediately supported the Cuban proposal. However, the Soviet bloc immediately pointed out that this move was an attempt to postpone the discussion of the Palestine issue until after the US presidential election. Polish representative Katz-Suchy and Belarusian representative Tsisslejew spoke in the General Assembly with great emotion. It is rumored that the Western powers intend to postpone the discussion of the Palestine issue. Katz-Suchy said, "We cannot postpone the discussion of the Palestine issue until after November 2nd." Syrian representative Khouri, speaking on behalf of the Arab bloc, said that the Security Council had already included the Palestine issue on the agenda, and according to the Charter, the UN committee should not discuss this issue again. Soviet representative Malik accused the Western powers of trying to postpone the discussion of Palestine with new excuses. British representative Cickles said that the British government certainly believes that the Palestine issue is an urgent issue, but most countries believe that it is too early to make a resolution at this time. The Political Committee ultimately passed the Cuban proposal by a vote of 34 to 11, postponing the discussion of the Palestine issue.

[This Newspaper Report] In order to promote the exchange of goods between three provinces and two cities and stabilize the economy of the Southeast region, the Shanghai District Goods Regulation Committee convened a meeting at 11:00 a.m. yesterday, chaired by Chairman Liu Gongyun.

After the meeting adjourned in the afternoon, Liu Gongyun and Li Lixia spoke separately with representatives from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The Jiangsu representatives were Qian Zhenrong and Niu Changyao, the Zhejiang representatives were Gong Peicheng and Feng Wenqi, and the Anhui representative was Shen Keji, the chief of the First Section of the Provincial Social Affairs Office. After exchanging views, the following methods for the circulation of goods between the three provinces and Shanghai were determined: (1) Jiangsu will supply Shanghai with surplus wheat and raw cotton, (2) Zhejiang will supply Shanghai with tung oil and ramie, (3) Anhui will supply Shanghai with rice, and (4) Shanghai will supply the three provinces with three kinds of goods: yarn, cloth, sugar, and fertilizer.

In addition, other places urgently need kerosene, so Shanghai will also supply the surplus if necessary.

### Proceeds from Rice Sales in Neighboring Counties Allowed to Purchase Industrial Products in Shanghai; Jiang Jingguo Agreed Yesterday with County Magistrates Such as Yu Songqing and Taicang

[This Newspaper Report] From 4:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. yesterday, Jiang Jingguo convened a meeting with the county magistrates of rice-producing counties such as Changshu, Songjiang, Qingpu, and Taicang. It was reported that the most important decision at the meeting was that when Shanghai rice merchants go to other places to purchase rice, the price will be paid in gold yuan first, but the other party will be allowed to purchase industrial finished products from Shanghai for 75 percent of the price with a certificate, and the managing authorities here will allow them to transport them out of the country.

[This Newspaper Report] According to people in the rice industry: The situation of rice arrivals in the North and South Markets has been relatively smooth recently, with an average of 700-800 shi arriving at each market per day, mostly from Pingwang, Songjiang, Kunshan, and other places. However, the suppression of weight in the producing areas is still common, and because the issuance of purchase certificates is sometimes delayed, when rice is滞留(detained) in various places, it is often taxed 30%, which is used for local stabilization purposes, which inevitably increases the difficulty for rice merchants to purchase. According to observations, it is believed that after the office of the managing inspectorate plans to adopt a barter trade policy, the source of rice will definitely be smoother.

### Sugar Industry Association Resolves to Expedite Inventory Registration

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the City Grain Business Association: since the ban on sugar exports on September 10, there has been no shortage of stock in this city. However, scalpers have been breaking down the price-controlled goods into smaller units, accumulating small amounts of sugar, and reselling them through multiple hands, raising prices and making profits, leading to a black market. The association has urgently resolved: (1) to continue to meet the purchase needs of sugar-requiring industries with the sugar voluntarily concentrated and sold publicly by fellow businesses, with prices limited to the August 19 market price; (2) to expedite inventory registration by fellow businesses. Once registration is closed within the next few days, a list of the stock will be created and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval of buyer targets, and supplies will be provided at the price-controlled rate as much as possible. Currently, more than 100,000 dan of stock has already been paid for by customers in other cities.

The question of whether to withdraw and deliver these goods from the stock, or to first transfer them for sale in this city and then repurchase from Taiwan Sugar Corporation for supply, was decided by the board of directors and supervisors yesterday and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. In the future, various sugar-requiring industries in this city can submit lists through their associations and request approval from the Social Affairs Bureau for sugar supply as much as possible. However, direct consumption by citizens will still need to follow the usual practice of purchasing in small quantities from local product stores.

### Milk Powder is Unavailable on the Market; The Main Reason is Import Restrictions

[Our Newspaper's Report] Amidst the abnormal supply of Western medicine, milk powder has also completely disappeared from the market recently. Although there are still one or two stalls selling loose milk powder released by the Materials Supply Bureau on the streets, they are very few in number.

### Daqing Gold and Foreign Currency Case; Fu Daodeng Zhonghe Interrogated; Proves No Involvement and is Released; Xiao Xueyong and Others to be Investigated

[Our Newspaper's Report] Daqing Company at 421 Ningbo Road is accused of private gold and foreign currency speculation. The Special Criminal Court summoned Deng Zhonghe, a shareholder of the company, yesterday afternoon. Deng went to the Special Criminal Court at 2:00 PM and was interrogated by Prosecutor Zhu Cheng. According to Deng, Xiao Xueyong, manager of Hailong Wool Weaving Factory, had previously paid Zhang Houqin, manager of Daqing Company, 30,000 pounds in cash to purchase 1,600 wool spinning spindles. This matter was approved by the Transportation Control Committee and issued a certificate of permission for foreign exchange settlement, so the foreign currency was not transferred privately. He presented the Transportation Control Committee certificate and the Social Affairs Bureau registration certificate (manager is Zhang Houqin) in court, and stated that he was only one of several shareholders of the company and was not usually responsible for actual duties. He was not very clear about the internal situation of the company. As for Xiao Xueyong, he had already gone to Hong Kong. Prosecutor Zhu believed that the evidence presented by Deng was sufficient to prove that the case was not related to him and ordered him to be released. The circumstances of the transfer of foreign currency between Xiao Xueyong and Zhang Houqin will continue to be investigated. The interrogation lasted until after 3:00 PM.

### Embezzlement by Fuel Control Committee Officials: Testimony from Merchants Vividly Depicts the Situation; Six-Hour Trial Session Concludes, Debate Scheduled to Begin on the 27th

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xie Zhiying, a judge from the District Court, continued the trial of the Fuel Control Committee officials' embezzlement and fraud case in Criminal Court No. 8 yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The defendants, including Yang Yunfu, Director of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Control Committee; Zou Jidao, Clerk and Coal Merchant; Zhao Bojun, Retired Military Officer; Mao Meiqi, Coal Merchant; and Sun Jice, Director of the Distribution Department of the Fuel Control Committee; Lin Keji, Section Chief; Miao Shouzi, Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui, Clerks; Sun Zhigang, General Affairs Officer of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Inland River Shipping Company; and Han Chengpu, Coal Merchant, totaling twelve individuals, were brought in early in the morning. Family members rushed to the waiting room to deliver food to the defendants and offer words of comfort.

During the initial trial on the 13th, most of the witnesses had been summoned to testify, and a general inquiry had been made regarding the defendants' embezzlement and fraudulent activities. During yesterday's trial, except for Sun Jice's wife, Ouyang De, Lin Keji's live-in girlfriend, Zhu Lichun, and a small number of witnesses who were unable to attend, over forty witnesses appeared in court to testify.

Ordinary Socializing to Foster Relationships

The trial commenced at 9:00 AM. Liang Zhuangxin, the section chief from the Municipal Government who investigated the case, also attended as a witness. The court first stated that the defendants Yang Yunfu and Lin Keji had hired more than three defense lawyers, exceeding the provisions of Article 28 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and ordered the dismissal of the excess lawyers. Subsequently, He Zhiying, the person in charge of the Shipping Bureau, testified that the bureau had three ships, which previously received 60 tons of coal per month, and at one point received 90 tons of coal. In September of last year, the ships broke down and were sent to the factory for repairs. The allocated coal was not used and was entrusted to Han Chengpu for sale at black market prices. When coal was insufficient, Han was also asked to supplement it. Selling the remaining coal involved selling the warehouse receipts from the Fuel Control Committee, which was a common business practice, and no one ever applied to return the remaining coal. The court inquired whether the dinner at the International Hotel last August, where Lin Keji and others were invited, was to request the committee to increase coal allocation. The response was that it was ordinary socializing to foster relationships. Wang Jianping of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Shipping Company admitted to sending gifts of cigarettes, alcohol, ham, and fruit to the two during the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival this year. Furthermore, he admitted to sending two checks, one for 20 million yuan at the end of last year and another for 100 million yuan during the Dragon Boat Festival this year. He denied having admitted to "tribute" of 100 million yuan per month to the management bureau. The court pressed him on this point, asking how much rice could be purchased with 20 million yuan last year and 100 million yuan this May. He replied that he did not know. Sun Jice testified that he and his wife were not often at home, and he did not know whether gifts were received. Lin Keji testified that he did not attend He's dinner and could not recall whether he had received gifts from He. The court noted that Sun's wife, Ouyang De, and Lin's housekeeper girlfriend, Zhu Lichun, were not present and could not provide testimony, so He was dismissed.

Having No Choice But to Offer "Tribute"

Next, Shi Jianren of the Songjiang Electric Company testified that the company's original coal allocation was 120 tons, but it was reduced by 20 tons when the Fuel Control Committee transitioned between old and new personnel last year. As a result, the allocation was insufficient, so he repeatedly requested Lin Keji to increase it. One day in July last year, Lin told him that he was very busy with official duties and asked him to come to his residence. Lin then complained that the salaries of civil servants were meager, and their lives were difficult. They often had to handle frequent social engagements due to their empty titles of "Director" and "Section Chief," which they could not afford. Lin then introduced him to Sun Jice, who said that coal supplies were tight at the time but that an increase could be arranged later, and suggested seeking supplies on the black market. He assessed their intentions and felt he had no choice but to offer "tribute." Therefore, starting in July last year, he sent them amounts ranging from 20 to 30 million yuan each month. The last time (August this year), he sent Sun 200 gold yuan and Lin 100 yuan. Each time, the money was placed in an envelope and delivered by the clerk Lu Biao to Lin's accountant at Huizhong. Lu Zhida confirmed this. The court considered this point to be of great importance and ordered Shi to repeat the above situation. Lin then argued that Mr. Shi's memory was unclear. He did not introduce Shi to Director Sun with a card, but he might have solicited donations from Shi on behalf of others. The court then successively questioned Shen Jinfu of Zaojiang, Lu Guangyao of Hongli, Yu Guanjin of Yuanda, Yan Azhang of Yuanbi, and Zhou Longgen of Detai regarding Ma Zhongliang of the United Tugboat Bureau's handling of the sale of surplus coal from seven shipping bureaus at black market prices and the four-six split of the profits. They all stated that Ma Zhongliang handled the collection of payments and they did not know whether the money was transferred to the Fuel Control Committee. Before adjourning for lunch, Yang Yunfu also defended himself against the accusation of being both an official and a businessman.

Inquiring About Experiences and Feelings About the Crimes

The trial continued at 1:00 PM. The focus of the inquiry was on the defendant Zou Jidao collecting tips from various coal merchants. Zhou Xinghuang of Yuda, Wei Xinbi of Rong Yuyi, Pan Zongli of Dashi, Hu Xiude of Huamao, Yang Shanfu of Taishan, and Zhang Tiancai of Zhang Mianji all testified to paying Zou transportation fees or tips ranging from several million yuan each time. At this point, the court considered the case to be fully understood and asked the defendants and their defense lawyers whether they had any rebuttal evidence to provide. The defendants Sun and Lin both claimed that coal allocation was handled impartially and insisted that the court review the original records of the Fuel Control Committee's coal allocation. The court ruled that the bailiffs should accompany the defendant Lin Keji to the archives room and notify the Fuel Control Committee's archivist by telephone to retrieve the relevant case files to expedite the conclusion of the case. During the time spent retrieving the files, the court questioned each defendant about their experiences and feelings about the crimes. According to Yang Yunfu's testimony, he graduated from Zhijiang University in 1924 and joined the Youth Party in 1927. He held positions in the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, the Tax Police Corps, and the Hangzhou Police Bureau. He is currently a member of the Central Committee and a member of the Supervisory Committee of the Youth Party. Last year, he was ordered to participate in the work of the Fuel Control Committee and had no other missions. From an economic perspective, the Fuel Control Committee had many shortcomings, but at the current stage, China is still suitable for a controlled economy. He felt suddenly arrested. Sun Jice testified that he joined the Youth Party in 1925, graduated from the Japanese Military Academy, and after returning to China, held military positions such as Chief of Staff, Garrison Commander, and Major General Deputy Division Commander. Zhao Bojun testified that he graduated from the tenth class of the military academy in 1933. Before the war, he served as a liaison officer stationed in Japan. After returning to China, he served as a regimental commander. Last year, he was dismissed and retired. Due to his poor financial situation, he changed to business in Shanghai, acting as an agent for coal purchase certificates. He did not violate any laws and hoped to obtain a 20% commission to maintain his livelihood. Lin Keji testified that he graduated from the Tokyo Police School in Japan. Last year, he was ordered by the Youth Party to participate in the work of the Fuel Control Committee. At 3:40 PM, the staff of the Fuel Control Committee's archives room delivered the files. After Sun and Lin reviewed them, they were immediately returned. The court considered the case to be clear and scheduled the debate to begin on the 27th. If there were no special circumstances, the verdict could be announced on the 3rd of next month. Han Chengpu, the merchant involved, requested bail due to illness and was granted. The other defendants were remanded in custody and returned to the court at around 4:00 PM.

### Tightening Credit Continues, Capital Outflow Intensifies

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to financial circles, credit has been gradually tightening recently. The main reason is that material controls in this city are extremely strict, and capital is gradually flowing out in batches to purchase materials in other regions. Furthermore, the authorities' implementation of joint purchases of national cotton and the procurement of rice have also resulted in a large outflow of capital. It is estimated that in the past half-month, the deposits of banks in this city have decreased by at least 30%.

### Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals Not Allowed

Financial Control Bureau Dispatches Inspectors

According to the Financial Control Bureau, due to the recent tightening of credit in the market, banks and financial institutions are generally short of funds, and bounced checks have increased accordingly. Recently, there have also been reports of banks and financial institutions restricting cash withdrawals. However, the bureau has not yet received any reports on this matter. Regarding the above two points, the bureau is currently dispatching personnel to the Shanghai Clearing House and various banks and financial institutions to conduct inspections to ascertain the truth.

### High Interest Rates at Hua Tong, Cash Being Transported South

Recently, banks and financial institutions in this city have again experienced a shortage of cash. Customers who go to the banks and financial institutions to withdraw cash of 100 yuan or more are unable to receive it immediately and must wait until the afternoon to obtain it.

Financial industry leaders analyze that the reason for the shortage of cash is that the interest rates in other regions have recently reached around 5%, while the interest rates in this city are much lower. Merchants are transporting cash to Guangzhou and Xiamen for lending. Furthermore, there is no shortage of materials in southern China and other regions, and merchants are taking funds to purchase and stockpile materials in these regions. Therefore, cash in this city is becoming increasingly scarce. This phenomenon will be difficult to stop for the time being unless the government issues more gold yuan, it is said.

### Replicated Industry Rationed Yarn

Monthly Demand Weak at 58,000 Pieces

The Replicated Industry Rationed Yarn Review Committee held its first meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The committee members present were Pan Shihao from the Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry, Ren Bingdao from the Underwear Knitting Industry, Fu Liangjun from the Cotton Weaving Industry, Ye Fikang from the Wool Spinning Industry, and Wu Zongcai from the Material Supply Committee, chaired by Gu Bingyuan from the Social Affairs Bureau.

First, it was reported that the survey of the quantity required by each factory in the self-manufacturing industry had been completed and submitted on the 14th, with a total monthly demand of approximately 57,971 pieces. It was also decided to send it to the Technical Committee of the Industrial Association for review. In the future, yarn rationing will be limited to factories registered before October 14. Newly added machinery, machinery that was not in use at the time of registration, and factories that are not members of the association will not be included. The committee also decided to meet once every Wednesday.

Cotton cloth is still suspended. The Spinning and Construction Company has not yet opened for sale. As autumn approaches, the industry is launching a campaign to sell goods. Currently, the stock of serge, straight tribute blue cloth, Shilin cloth, khaki cloth, and other fabrics on the market is decreasing daily. Merchants are short of goods to supply to retail outlets, and they are being snapped up by scalpers. Therefore, most citizens are unable to purchase them. Yesterday, the association authorities ordered various dyeing and weaving factories to sell large quantities to meet the needs of the city, it is said.

### China Textile's Yarn Rationing Sharply Reduced, Cotton Cloth Not Sold Yesterday

China Textile's yarn rationing was sharply reduced yesterday, with only 679 pieces, totaling 494,755 gold yuan. This included blue-labeled 20-count Double Happiness large packages, priced at 700 yuan. White-labeled 6-count Auxiliary Sunlight rough packages, 255 yuan. Also, 10-count Auxiliary Blue Phoenix spools, 480 yuan, 10-count Double-Strand Harvest rough packages, 528 yuan, 15-count Harvest rough packages, 573 yuan, 40-count Baoguang rough packages, 880 yuan, and 42-count Baoguang rough packages, 1,010 yuan. Furthermore, 42-count double-strand fine yarn was allocated to the hand-cranked sock, hand-knitted cotton, and weaving belt associations. 40-count yarn was limited to the handkerchief and underwear industries. 15-count coarse yarn was limited to towels, and 10-count and 10-count double-strand yarn were limited to the canvas industry. Additionally, there were 25-strand twines for rope and belt rationing, priced at 2.13 yuan per pound, as well as 6-strand, 9-strand, and 10-strand twines.

Also, it was reported that the yarn rationing for this month is uniformly 20-count Double Happiness, priced at 700 yuan per piece, allocated to Chongming (2 pieces), Yin County (40 pieces), Jingjiang (5 pieces), Yongjia (42 pieces), Yongkang (2 pieces), Jiading (43 pieces), Jiangdu (9 pieces), Changsha (24 pieces), Nanchang (3 pieces), and Yiyang (6 pieces). All applications are to be made using blue-colored purchase slips, and payment is to be made to the Central Bank.

### To Resolve the Domestic Cotton Shortage, Two Batches of U.S. Cotton to be Utilized

The second batch of 220,000 bales of U.S. aid cotton, decided by the U.S. Aid Cotton Group to alleviate the cotton shortage, will have half of it extracted first for distribution to various factories. The inventory list has been calculated, and the distribution procedures and proportions will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the first batch.

Also, it was reported that the Qingdao China Textile Branch Factory suspended operations due to a cotton shortage, significantly affecting production. The U.S. Cotton Association sent Wei Tefeiqing to investigate and confirmed that the situation was indeed serious. It has now been decided to extract and utilize over 10,000 bales of U.S. cotton frozen in Qingdao first.

### Transportation Problems Cannot Be Resolved

Also, it has been learned that regarding the problem of transporting the cotton already collected from domestic cotton purchases, a solution has not yet been thoroughly resolved. The export transportation routes in various production areas have been largely destroyed by bandits and cannot be repaired for the time being. Currently, the only available option is air transport, but the number of state-owned or private transport aircraft is very small, and each aircraft can only carry 5 tons per trip, which is far less than the carrying capacity of ships and trains. Furthermore, the freight costs are particularly high. If aircraft are used exclusively for transportation, the supply will not be sufficient to meet the needs of various yarn factories in this city. The purchasing authorities are currently anxious about this matter, it is said.

Current Cotton Prices Are Soft

There were no transactions in current cotton yesterday, but market sentiment has softened. Since the 16th, various yarn factories have not been able to purchase cotton independently. Apart from selling to joint purchases in accordance with the factories' legal procedures, cotton merchants can no longer trade with yarn factories, so the market is quiet and soft.

Rayon Rationing Continues

Also, according to the Central Trust Bureau, the quota for rayon this week remains as allocated. Italian rayon for barter will be allocated at 3% of last week's allocation, with a listed price of 1,033.3 yuan per case.

### No Silk Fabrics Available on the Market

Due to rumors from the Central Trust Bureau of a possible suspension of rayon rationing, silk weaving businesses on the street were quite alarmed about the source of raw materials. Sales staff at silk shops also reported that they had no goods to sell even to customers buying small quantities. Market sentiment was exceptionally firm. The association still allocated 32 small packages yesterday, but the quantity was so small that many applicants were disappointed. Both domestic and export raw silk were unavailable, and there were no retail transactions heard of on the street. The market remained cold.

Silk and satin merchants from various regions gathered in Shanghai, with strong demand. However, due to the fact that the raw materials problem has not yet been resolved, factories are producing very few goods. Most businesses are holding onto their goods and observing the situation. There were many buyers at silk shops selling retail cuts yesterday, and market sentiment was exceptionally strong.

### Transactions Still Not Underway, Rice Arrivals Slightly Less, Miscellaneous Grains Trading at a Standstill

Rice arrivals continued, but the quantity decreased slightly. The rice shops and rice mills in the Southern District received 826 stones and 7 dou, and the rice brokers received 842 stones, totaling 1,688 stones and 7 dou. The total arrivals in the Northern District were 597 stones, including 163 stones sold by the sales shops, 730 stones by the rice mills, and 64 stones self-managed by non-industry entities. The total arrivals in the two markets were 2,265 stones and 7 dou. Market prices remained unchanged, with Southern unpolished japonica rice at 17.66 yuan and unpolished indica rice with bags at 17 yuan. Transactions were still not underway, and flour remained suspended.

The miscellaneous grains market saw trading at a standstill yesterday. As a result of the soybean registration, there were 32,789 packages, of which 24,000 packages had been approved for export by the Transportation Management Committee. There was still stock, waiting to be distributed to tofu shops, so there were no transactions. Groundnuts and sesame seeds were unavailable due to limited stock. Corn and sorghum were unanimously not being traded.

### Sugar Supply Cannot Meet Demand

Sugar trading was still scarce yesterday. The phenomenon of customers scrambling to purchase at retail outlets on the street became even more congested. Various southern goods shops have been restricting purchases since yesterday. The stocks held by sugar wholesalers have been centrally allocated by the association, so supply has also been suspended.

### Tea Market Trading Narrow

Recently, although Hua tea exports have not been smooth, exporters, foreseeing the state of production and inventory, continued to intend to engage in purchases to prepare for the future. However, principals believe that it is difficult to collect and procure raw tea materials. At the same time, due to the difficulty in purchasing all the ancillary items for replicating and exporting boxed tea, there is no urgent desire to dispose of the goods in hand. Therefore, supply and demand are still difficult to match, and trading remains narrow. The underlying trend continues to be stable. As for domestic tea, demand is still greater than supply, and the market atmosphere is firm amid calm.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Clarification, Clarification on Handling House Purchases

[Asked by Dai Songzhi] I recently purchased a house and plan to go to the relevant authorities to register the transfer of title. I have several questions and would appreciate your answers: (1) Are the house purchase contract and all related documents required to be submitted to the Land Administration Bureau for verification?

[Answered by Lawyer Fu Kuang] (1) It should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 74 of the Land Law.

[Dajiang News] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of National Defense, among other agencies, have formulated and promulgated measures to give preferential treatment to overseas Chinese students applying to military academies in the country. The main points are as follows: (1) The recruitment of overseas Chinese youth to various military academies will be handled uniformly by the United Logistics Headquarters. (2) The preliminary examinations abroad will be conducted by the United Logistics Headquarters, which will send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to entrust the consulates and embassies in designated locations to host the examinations, and request the assistance of local overseas Chinese education associations and party headquarters. (3) With the exception of Chinese language, which will have a lower passing standard of 40 points, all other subjects will be administered in accordance with the regulations of the recruiting school. (4) After returning to China, overseas Chinese students who pass the preliminary examinations abroad will be temporarily admitted to the "Overseas Chinese Student Training Class" for preliminary training, and each headquarters will be notified to send personnel to conduct re-examinations. (5) Overseas Chinese youth who are already in the country and apply to military academies may also enjoy the preferential treatment provided in Article 4 of these measures if they hold formal documents proving their overseas Chinese status.

### Glimpses of Academia: Jinan Snippets - Nanyang Beauties Hot as Fire, Shanghai Girls Wild as the Wind

After two weeks of classes, the entire campus life has settled into its routine. The Academic Affairs Office and the Student Affairs Office have recently been busy with two major tasks: one is arranging classroom seating, and the other is handling ID card registration procedures, which students also take very seriously.

Various departmental clubs are successively discussing holding welcome parties, and the bulletin boards are full of notices. However, only the Guangdong Students' Association is providing refreshments.

In recent days, the news has been fraught with tension. Students from the war zones inevitably crowd around to read the newspapers every day, whispering to each other, their facial expressions quite awkward.

The Jiangsu-Anhui Students' Association has recently announced the registration for public funding applications for northern Jiangsu students, which has delighted all the students from northern Jiangsu upon hearing the news.

The female students at our school are most notable from the Guangdong and Shanghai areas. Someone commented, "Nanyang beauties are hot as fire, Shanghai girls wild as the wind." This can be said to be both humorous and apt. (Ning)

### Yu Dafu and Wang Ernan

— Chen Zihe

Astonishing talent endured a sinking thought, liver and guts flowed rainbows pouring out a goblet, mountain parsley grew green according to its lot, how many people know of tears at the edge of the world; where is the soul-recalling wind and rain hut? bones abandoned in the barbarian lands, the dream still uncertain, hearing that the children miss each other bitterly, the night cold, they still recite the poems of ruining the family. — Eulogy to Dafu

Not long after the national victory, it seemed I heard of Dafu's tragic news. I inquired of the Yu family's relatives, and they were all half doubting and half believing. Although I disliked Dafu's mountain spirit, I knew his actions in recent years and that he was quite discreet. He would not bring disaster upon himself with his words. Moreover, the enemy had surrendered, so how dare they again indulge in evil deeds? In the end, I hoped that he would be an overseas Su Shi. Time passed quickly, and three years flew by. Birds returning from the edge of the world flew back to the Shanghai fortress one after another. Even if Dafu was in love with a foreign land, how could he abandon his motherland? Alas! Dafu is truly dead! The autumn moon hangs low, and the insect sounds are mournful. I remember Dafu's urgent laughter and words. Where is his soul? I composed a poem in my sleep, got up again to trim the lamp, and briefly recorded the beginning and end of our friendship.

In the first month of the year Wu Chen in the seventeenth year [of the Republic], I visited Master Wang Ernan at Minhou Nanli on Hartung Road. The master was a learned scholar from Hangzhou, known as a child prodigy in his youth. He read books with a glance and never forgot them, even in his old age. He knew the classics, histories, hundred schools of thought, astronomy, geography, court rules, and allusions, all verbatim, as if counting family treasures. His poems, ancient prose, grand compositions, and magnificent articles were unparalleled. He could drink alcohol and liked to discuss matters with young people. I was seventeen years old and joined his school, studying the scriptures and asking for definitions, as if sitting in a spring breeze. At that time, it was the third year of the Republic, and he was sixty-two years old. That winter, the master mourned his deceased wife. The next year, his son Shi Qun died of illness without an heir. His son-in-law Jin Bingsun also passed away due to illness in the sixth month of Yiwei, leaving behind two sons and two daughters. The master, seeing that there was no one to care for him at home, summoned his widowed daughter to live with him and her children. Because he had no heir, he took one son and one daughter of Jin as his grandchildren. Although the master was open-minded, he said to me: A family of widowers, widows, orphans, and the lonely. I have no sins, is this not the calamity of Heaven upon me? In Dingmao, as the National Revolutionary Army approached Jiangsu and Zhejiang, fearing the resistance of the Northern Army, he moved his family to Shanghai. That day, when I went to pay my respects, I saw a young man about to leave with his head held high. His clothes and shoes were plain, and his appearance was not very outstanding. He nodded to me but did not say a word and left. The master said: This is Yu Dafu. I said: Is he a fellow student? The master said: He has been engaged to my granddaughter for a long time. I asked if he was thirty-three years old, and his eldest grandson was thirteen years old. I foolishly asked: I heard that Dafu already has a wife, will he marry his grandson? He said: His former wife has divorced. I suddenly said: How sad for the abandoned wife! The master was silent. Then, he sighed and said: This old man is seventy-six years old this year. The world is like this, what can I do? I was speechless. The next day, I returned to Hangzhou, and I saw Gongsun strolling in the downtown area with Dafu. Not long after, I heard that they were married in Japan. This was the beginning of my meeting with Dafu.

In the fourth month of Yiwei, the master returned to Hangzhou and rented a place in Jinchai Dai Alley. I heard that Dafu would come to Hangzhou every month, but I had not met him. On the ninth day of the seventh month, I asked for corrections on a Qixi poem. Dafu was serving drinks, and he greatly admired my poem after reading it. I privately wondered, do those who study language like old-style poems? So we talked about poetry. Dafu said: I am new in literature but old in poetry. It suits my nature. He also said: Poetry has no distinction between ancient and modern. Those who can go deep and come out shallow are all good. I also said: I like to make a big deal out of small topics, and I also like to make a small deal out of big topics. I only want to make every poem, every couplet, and every sentence have great openness and closure. This is what I love and admire, but I have not been able to achieve it. Dafu was very happy and said: This "ten thousand spirits from the mountains go to Jingmen" can be an example. The master looked at us and was happy. That day, we talked and drank to our heart's content, each reaching a drunken state. This was the beginning of my friendship with Dafu, and I remember it vividly.

In the second month of Xinwei, Master Nan suddenly passed away due to a stroke. Dafu and I jointly managed his funeral. His grandson had not yet come of age. From then on, Dafu had the intention of living in Hangzhou, for the sake of his wife's family. A year later, the thatched cottage was completed. The cottage was located in the Changguan Alley in the east of the city, with a small garden near Baoguo Temple. It was a storage place for weapons, next to the Zhejiang Library. He often boasted that he had two warehouses, one for literature and one for military. At that time, I was working in Shaoxing. Every week when I returned, I would always go to drink. However, although the alley was remote, carriages and horses often stayed there. The guests were literary and military officials. I did not like it very much. After a long time, I said to Dafu: In the past, Lu Xun prevented you from returning to Hangzhou, but why do you associate with walking corpses now? You must know that there is no vitality in the officialdom. Dafu said: I am just using it to mix in, don't worry. After a long time, Dafu entered the Fujian government. However, he often returned and gave me lacquerware with seals as gifts. Especially after he died, seeing them made my stomach ache.

The August 13th Incident broke out suddenly, and I sent my entire family to live in Yuecheng. There was no news from Dafu. One day, in early winter at dusk, Dafu suddenly came to visit alone. I asked him in surprise where he came from. He said: The sea route from Fujian to Shanghai is cut off. I will detour through Xianxia to enter Fujian. My family is in Wu. I will say goodbye to old friends by the way. I quickly prepared wine to reward him. During the drink, Dafu turned to me and said: You cannot stay here for long. If there is an emergency, you can come to Fujian. The enemy has no plans for Fujian, remember carefully. He spoke earnestly. I was worried about whether my entire family, young and old, more than twenty people, would be able to go at that time. Dafu said: You have your own means of transportation, what are you worried about? That night, we stayed together at the Longshan Inn. The next day, I sent him on his way, and we said goodbye with great care. Who knew that this farewell would become a final farewell. Alas!

Dafu left behind four sons and one daughter: son Mou, daughter Jiemin, grandchildren Sun Shi Shan, Sun Yangchun (Fei), Dianchun (Yun), Jianchun, from the Wang family. Yangchun is studying at Shanghai Middle School, living in the home of Mr. Chen Gongqia. Jianchun is still staying with a certain lady in Fuzhou, and the rest live in Fuyang, raised by the Sun family.

### Passing Zhou Wei in Autumn

— He Tianjian

I traveled here seven years ago

Rubble, desolate smoke, old plank door, I haven't seen it for seven years, but it still exists. Talented people dress up sadly in their old age, good dreams of spring travels are hard to relive. Little crows suspiciously come and go. Autumn flowers seem to silently speak, walking and forgetting the east-west road, still the slanting sun warms half a wall!

Flute and zither are even more abandoned, jade case and golden knife, thoughts not forgotten; attaching a bit of affection, the sky also grows old, leaving a thousand years of traces, the land can grow long. Cold frost doesn't care that the monk's heart is white, the chrysanthemum by the fence is especially yellow because of people; everything before you is mostly overlooked, suspicious clouds and rain are only ordinary.

Meeting Tiansheng on the Lake

Wearing a tilted hat south of the city, not like the old times, holding hands in the west wind, why so late. Over the years, the atmosphere of war, the wild goose has no news, today my worried heart knows. Such autumn scenery, the sky is also beautiful, there are many partings and sorrows, my stomach shares the same feelings. Today, the wine custom is broken for you, but I lack Tao Yuanming's chrysanthemum half a fence.

### Suffering

— Yi Jun

Every day, I only know to go out early and return late, rushing to get on the bus. I have never felt anything about the so-called "panic buying" of supplies on the market. Although I have indirectly heard others talk about it, I am not interested. But after all, people are social animals. I don't ask about social affairs, but social affairs still come to trouble me.

I was taking advantage of the Double Ten Festival that day to buy a suit, but unexpectedly, after walking to Sichuan Road, I found that nine out of ten shops were closed to "celebrate." I couldn't buy a suit that day. Okay, I'll buy it on the 12th, when there's nothing to celebrate. But when I went to Wusong Road, where there are the most suit shops, full of hope, I was greatly disappointed again; there were suit "shops," but there were no "suits." Were there? But they were just some tattered clothes. The boss also had a sullen face and was displeased. So, I had to "see what I saw and leave."

What to do? Fortunately, I still know a little about military strategy and know how to adapt to circumstances. Since I can't buy a suit, I'll change my plan and make a Zhongshan suit—isn't it natural and right for Chinese people to wear Zhongshan suits? So, I immediately "rushed" to Nanjing Road, "squeezed" into a woolen shop, and "relied" on my national ID card to "snatch" three yards of uniform wool.

That's right, three yards of uniform wool is enough to make a Zhongshan suit, but when it was sent to the tailor shop, the problem came again: the feather gauze for the lining, which the tailor shop usually had, is now gone. Since the problem has come, it must be solved. The solution is to buy it yourself. Who knew that after running to more than forty shops yesterday, I couldn't buy an inch of feather gauze; even holding an ID card didn't work.

Then I suddenly realized, needless to say, my share of the material must have been "panic-bought" by others.

I didn't participate in the panic buying this time. Honestly, it wasn't because I didn't have money. Don't look down on me as just a poor teacher, but my school's salary is paid in several months at a time, and there is never any piecemeal delay; I had already received more than 500 gold yuan vouchers in mid-September, which was more than enough to make two or three suits, but I didn't do so, and that's why I suffered.

Why bother? One should work hard in their career. Mr. Sober II's analysis shows that "panic buying" won't "cheapen" anything.

But the panic buyers will say, "If I don't panic buy, others will panic buy. If others empty it out, where will I buy it?"

It's terrible, it's terrible on this kind of thinking. The current situation is what everyone has "thought" into being.

### Scramble to Eat

— Ma Jixian

On Sunday, a friend invited me to Da Sanyuan for breakfast. It was already quite late, ten o'clock. It should have already passed breakfast time. Although it was Sunday, it didn't seem like it would be very crowded.

But when I arrived at Da Sanyuan, I couldn't believe that from the ground floor to the third floor, not only were all the seats already full, but there were still crowds of people standing next to them, waiting for the previous guests to make way for the next ones. Just looking at this crowded scene, even the best appetite would be scared away. But I couldn't resist my friend's kind persuasion, and I finally managed to occupy a seat in the crowd with my friend.

After waiting for a long time, the dim sum did not come for a long time. When the waiter appeared in the venue with the order in hand, the diners couldn't wait to distribute them one by one, so they all acted on their own, not picking the good or bad, and snatched them clean.

My friend and I also grabbed and ate some not-so-satisfactory dim sum in this mess. It was almost twelve o'clock when we came out. We didn't eat much, but after this battle, the appetite for lunch had completely disappeared.

Just the distorted phenomenon seen in a dim sum meal, the perverted psychology of "eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die!" has been completely exposed!

### Dancing is Going to be Banned Again

— Liu Tai

I read in the newspaper today that dancing is going to be banned again in Shanghai.

In recent months, the call to ban dancing seems to have been carried out in a wave-like pattern. It was said in March that it would be banned, but nothing more was heard; in June it was said that a lottery would be held for the songs in the dance halls, but nothing more was heard; in September there were rumors that the ban on dancing would really be implemented, but nothing more was heard as before. Now, in December, the saying that dancing will be banned has become a foregone conclusion, and it seems that it will definitely be implemented. Will there be anything more to be heard at that time? No one can say for sure.

I never dance. But I am really interested in the ban on dancing - not because this matter involves women, but because I think our officials are really "easy to play with." At first, they decided to ban it in a dignified manner, and even ignored the local authorities' request to postpone it, seeming to have the spirit of definitely implementing orders. However, after a disturbance at the Shanghai Social Bureau, the order to ban dancing was left unissued. It is said that in order to take care of the livelihoods of those employees who have always engaged in malpractice, the government's prestige is slightly wronged. It is also the heart of the benevolent. The government should take the people's livelihood issues as the first priority. However, now it is going to be banned again! We want to ask? Is there any determination this time? Ban dancing or not, we have no opinion in principle—we only want to know one thing: will we repeat the same tiger-headed and snake-tailed mistake as last time?

If you want to ban it, ban it completely, and don't let all the dance halls still be full of singing and dancing as before next March and June. If this time it is just a set of official clichés again, then although the "official style" of the "article" will not be reduced from previous years, the topic of the "article" will inevitably be stale!

### Scholar and Official

— Wu Yong

"Learning to serve" is the most misleading saying. And "useless learning" is the most likely to mislead oneself.

For example, Hu Shi studied the two family scandals of Ouyang Xiu in a serious manner. We cannot say that this is not "learning", but what is the "use"? Gao Benhan studied the differences in grammar between the ancient Chinese books "Zuo Zhuan", "Guo Yu", "Book of Documents", "Book of Songs", and "Zhuangzi". We cannot say that it is not "learning", but what is it "used" for? As for Einstein's theory of relativity, what "use" has it ever had? According to the rule of "learning to serve", Einstein's academic research must be related to the construction of the atomic bomb, and only then can it be said to be practical.

Traditional Chinese academics have always emphasized the practical aspects. For example, Chinese thinkers and philosophers, not to mention the Confucians, even the Taoists and Yin-Yang schools, when talking about "Tao" and "Taiji", all centered on personnel and politics. There are not many theoretical studies that purely target the natural world.

I guess that in people's minds, the meaning of the two words "serving" is not as broad as the literal interpretation. Most people think that "learning excels" and one will inevitably become an "official". "Serving" probably only refers to the word "official". Therefore, deep in most people's hearts, they think: If you don't become an official by learning, then why bother learning? If you can't become an official by learning, then it can be seen that your learning is not excellent enough. And there is a common saying that "doing official work for thousands of miles is only for wealth", then the meaning of the two words "serving" is further reduced to refer to "being useful to oneself". Based on this, even if Edison is as keen on "serving" as he is, if he was born in our country, he must set up his own factory to manufacture light bulbs and phonographs, etc., and make a fortune, and then he can be admired and praised as great. Otherwise, he is just a nosy fool. Because in our country, just doing things that benefit others will not arouse our admiration. What we admire is: a person can greatly find a way to benefit oneself.

Today's scholars have fallen sharply in social status and are quite despised. I have always thought about the reason. If it is because today's scholars are poor? However, the "poor scholars" of the past were not scorned. And there have never been many "rich scholars". I guess that the "scholars" of the past were respected because they could become "officials"; the scholars of today are despised, simply because becoming an "official" today does not necessarily require a "scholar". Originally, whether in the past or today, no one has ever been respected simply because he is a scholar. I privately think that the respect of the past was respected incorrectly, and the contempt of today is contemptible incorrectly.

Lin Yutang said in "The Biography of Su Dongpo": China has always suffered from an overabundance of official talents. Chinese people think that "learning excels" and not becoming an official is an incredible thing, which has led to the phenomenon of "too much monk porridge". If this kind of thinking does not change, then simply the result of popularizing education is enough to destroy China. Because the government can never place 450 million "official talents", and so on. Indeed. However, Lin did not know something: today's people's view of "scholars" has long been changed. It must be known that today's "academics" are not necessarily "academic officials", let alone "Dragon Diagram Pavilion Academics". And even if a "scholar" can become an "official", the profit is not great. Today's civil servants are known to the world for their meager treatment. Therefore, among relatives and friends, there are many who abandon their studies and engage in business when their circumstances allow them to continue their studies. Because there is no profit to be made from reading, why bother being looked down upon? According to this trend, our country does not have the danger of too much education being popularized. We can rest assured.

What is feared is: the people's solid light "scholar" and heavy "official" heart still follow the old habits. In this way, scholars will inevitably decrease or even disappear, but official talents will still increase greatly. If this is really the case, then the way to solve the problem cannot only rely on trying to prevent the popularization of education.
