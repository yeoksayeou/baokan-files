[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, upon the President's order, flew to Zhengzhou by special plane from Nanjing on the morning of the 20th to command the military rescue of Kaifeng. He also convened Sun Zhen, Liu Ruming, and others to give instructions. He returned to Nanjing from Zhengzhou by the same plane at 9 PM that evening. It is also learned that the Hu Lian troops reinforcing Kaifeng had reached the outskirts of Kaifeng City on the 20th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] According to a military news agency's urgent dispatch from Kaifeng at 9 AM on the 20th: The Battle of Kaifeng is now in its final stage. Since the first batch of bandits who broke into the southeastern corner of the city yesterday afternoon was repelled, and more than 1,700 bandits who broke in for the second time were completely annihilated, the remaining five to six thousand bandits who broke in for the third time in the evening engaged in fierce street fighting with the defending troops in the southeastern city gate area. The fierce battle continued until midnight. The security forces in the southern part of the city transferred their positions to the northern part of the city, constructed fortifications, and continued to confront the bandits. More than 700 bandits who had invaded near the Song Gate in the eastern part of the city were annihilated. Another group of bandits broke in and set fires in the city center. This morning, civilian houses near the northwest of the provincial government have been occupied by the bandits. Currently, the air force is heavily bombing the bandits inside and outside the city, and the bandit's momentum has been slightly thwarted. The national army is firmly defending the provincial government and the artillery positions in the northwestern corner of the city, as well as the three major strongholds of Henan University in the northeast, and is fighting a desperate battle with the bandits. Reinforcements have arrived on the outskirts of Kaifeng and are fiercely attacking the bandit's flank.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] The Battle of Kaifeng entered its fourth day and night today. With the assistance of the powerful aircraft of the Yellow Sea and East Sea air groups, the defending troops fought bravely and the morale is increasingly high. After midnight on the morning of the 20th, some bandits broke in from the west gate and were bravely resisted by the defending troops south of the provincial government, resulting in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The air force also flew low to assist in the battle. By dusk on the 20th, almost all of the bandits had been annihilated, and the breach in the west gate had been blocked. The attacking forces on Kaifeng have been confirmed as the 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns of the Chen bandit and the 1st Column of the Liu bandit, totaling more than 60,000 troops. They have suffered at least 10,000 casualties due to the combined land and air attacks by the national army over the past few days.

[Another Dispatch] The two major air groups, Yellow Sea and East Sea, continued to fly over Kaifeng day and night on the 20th to assist in the annihilation of the stubborn bandits. It is reported that more than 20 tons of bombs have been dropped today, killing at least 3,000 bandits. The flight personnel of the two major air groups witnessed from the air the fierce hand-to-hand combat between the defending troops south of the provincial government and the invading bandits. The high morale was beyond description. The two major air groups maintained a strong presence over Kaifeng today, ensuring that there were aircraft providing cover at all times. The close cooperation between land and air forces has reached the most ideal state.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 20th] Air force aircraft today heavily bombed more than a hundred bandit boats concentrated in the area of Dayaozhai on the south bank of the Yellow River north of Bian, sinking them all.

### Henan Representatives in Beijing, Zhang Honglie and Others, Petitioned the President for Aid to Bian, The President Personally Received Them and Said the National Army Had Thorough Deployment

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Amidst the crisis in Kaifeng, five Henan representatives in Beijing to the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, and Provincial Assembly, Zhang Honglie, Li Hongyi, Duan Jianmin, Zhao Peiwu, and Wang Rupan, went to the President's residence on Huangpu Road on the morning of the 20th to petition. The President personally received them at 11 AM. Zhang, Li, and others lamented the critical situation in Bian and Zheng, and requested that a large army be dispatched quickly for rescue. Duan, Li, and others cried and pleaded with tears in their eyes. The President replied that the central government had a thorough deployment for the war situation in Henan Province and had sent senior officials to Zhengzhou to command. The central government was determined to use the fastest methods and make the greatest effort to rescue Kaifeng. The President also stated that he would take absolute responsibility for military affairs and hoped that everyone would trust the President and the army, and not be too anxious. President Chiang Kai-shek also said that the main force of the bandits was now in western Shandong, and the national army had a thorough deployment to give them a severe blow. The meeting lasted more than ten minutes. Zhang, Li, and the other five then left. At 4 PM, people from Henan in Beijing learned that the bandits had attacked and entered Kaifeng City at noon on the 20th, and the situation was urgent. They gathered again with Henan National Assembly representatives, Legislative Yuan members, Control Yuan members, provincial assembly members, and more than 300 fellow villagers to discuss countermeasures. They decided to go to the President's residence again to petition. At 6 PM, more than 100 people from Henan in Beijing first went to the Presidential Palace to request an audience, but learned that the President was not in the palace. They then went to the residence on Huangpu Road at 8 PM to request an audience, presenting three requests: (1) Please dispatch a large army quickly day and night to rescue Zheng and Bian. (2) Please have the President personally inspect the front lines to boost morale, or send a senior official to rescue Kaifeng within a limited time and ensure Zhengzhou. (3) Please have the central government punish the military commanders who have mishandled the situation and failed to provide effective rescue. Because the President had already received the Henan representatives in the morning and given a sincere reply, he did not grant an audience. The petitioning representatives insisted on seeing the President. At about 9 PM, Yu Jishi, representing the President, met with them, expressing that the central government had sent a large army to rescue and explaining the central government's emphasis on the war situation in Henan Province, hoping that the representatives would return first. At about 10 PM, Xue Yue, the Chief of the Military Affairs Department, had a sincere talk with the petitioning representatives, repeatedly explaining the central government's intention to emphasize the Henan situation. The people from Henan still refused to leave and refused to eat or drink anything, insisting on a hunger strike to the end. At about 11 PM, Qin Decun, the Vice Minister, reported to the petitioning representatives that there were seven major strongholds in Kaifeng City that were still in the hands of the national army, and that reinforcements had approached the suburbs, and that it had been decided to send more troops to continue to rescue and send senior officials to Zhengzhou to take charge. The petitioning representatives were still in high spirits and refused to leave. After Xue Yue and Qin Decun repeatedly persuaded them, and guaranteed to meet them at 10 AM the next morning, the petitioning representatives left the President's residence at 1:30 AM this morning.

### Postal Rates to Increase Threefold, Executive Yuan Has Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Deliberation, May Take Effect on July 1st

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] An increase in postal rates is inevitable, marking the end of months of soaring prices. At its regular meeting last week, the Executive Yuan, based on a request from the Ministry of Communications, approved the rate increase, raising the cost of ordinary letters from 5,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan, a threefold increase. The rates for other postal items will be increased proportionally. Because the postal rate increase concerns an increase in the people's burden, the Executive Yuan has submitted it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation in accordance with the law. It is generally expected that if legislative procedures can be completed quickly, it may take effect on July 1st. It is reported that the last rate increase was on April 5th, three months ago. Due to rising prices and repeated increases in employee benefits, revenue cannot cover expenses. Losses in June exceeded one trillion yuan. The Ministry of Communications therefore requested a rate increase and proposed two options: one is to increase the current price by three times, with ordinary letters costing 20,000 yuan; the other is to increase the current price by five times, with ordinary letters costing 30,000 yuan. After consultation, the Executive Yuan decided to increase it by three times and plans to implement it on July 1st.

### U.S. Congress Passes Foreign Aid Bill, Aid to China Amounting to 400 Million Yuan, Including 125 Million Yuan in Military Aid, Sent to President Truman for Signature

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Congress completed action on the $6,030,710,228 foreign aid bill on the morning of the 20th, including 400 million yuan in aid to China. The bill has been sent to President Truman for signature. The aid package for China includes 125 million yuan in military aid.

Shortly after the House passed the compromise bill by a vote of 318 to 62, the Senate passed the bill by a voice vote.

Before the Senate vote, Vandenberg praised the action of the joint committee of the two houses in restoring most of the cuts made by the House as a "fundamental contribution to world peace."

[United Press, Washington, 19th] After breaking a serious deadlock on the evening of the 19th, the joint committee of the Senate and House passed a $6,030,710,228 foreign aid fund, including a $400 million aid fund for China. The joint committee also agreed that the U.S. government should decide whether the $4 billion aid fund for Europe should be allocated in fifteen months or twelve months. The aid fund for China includes $125,000,000 in military aid. The foreign aid fund includes $1,300,000,000 for relief and reconstruction in the four occupied zones of Japan, Korea, Germany, and Austria. After reaching an agreement, the joint committee broke the deadlock that would have prevented Congress from adjourning on the evening of the 19th. This was a victory for the Senate, which had insisted that the European aid plan and other aid plans should receive the amounts recommended by the government. Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman and Secretary of State Marshall were convinced that $4 billion was needed within twelve months and was urgently needed. In addition to the European aid fund, the committee also passed: (1) a $400 million aid fund for China, including $125,000,000 in military aid; (2) $1.3 billion for relief and reconstruction in the four occupied zones of Germany, Japan, Austria, and Korea; (3) $225,000,000 for Greece and Turkey to "isolate communism"; (4) $35,000,000 for the United Nations Children's Relief Fund; (5) $70,710,228 for the International Refugee Organization Fund. The joint committee almost entirely agreed with the amounts advocated by the Senate. The final decision was $503,000,000 less than requested by President Truman.

### Principles of Sino-U.S. Bilateral Agreement Determined

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement on the use of U.S. aid to China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been intensifying its study of the U.S. draft for the past month and actively consulting with the U.S. Embassy. Various principles have been determined with reference to the U.S. "Economic Cooperation Act of 1948" and the actual situation. Once a report is made to the Legislative Yuan and approved, it can be formally signed. This agreement will be signed in the form of an administrative agreement. It will take effect after signing. It is reported that the main points of its content, in addition to stating that the economic and other relations between China and the United States are very close, and that aid is provided to enable China to help itself, seek domestic economic stability, and eliminate the current situation that may endanger the establishment of lasting peace; it also stipulates the measures that China should take to accept this aid, and other matters concerning the supply of materials and other matters. All aid, except for the 60 million U.S. dollar construction loan, will be provided to our country in the form of donations. The important measures that China should take are approximately: (1) Implement a self-help plan to increase agricultural and industrial production to the extent that no additional assistance is needed. To achieve this goal, the United States will provide material assistance for increasing coal, oil, and food production, and for transportation construction. (2) Take fiscal and monetary measures to stabilize the currency, determine exchange rates, and balance the budget to restore monetary credibility. (3) Effectively utilize domestic resources and foreign aid, including all materials, wealth, labor, and the property and income of Chinese people in the United States. (4) Facilitate trade with the United States and, on a reasonable principle, agree with the United States to supply the industrial raw materials it needs and which it itself lacks. In addition, it may be stipulated that when the United States grants aid to China in the form of a donation, China will deposit an equivalent amount of legal tender into a special account. This amount is combined with the unused amount from the sale of relief materials under the previous Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement. It may only be used to stabilize the monetary and fiscal system, increase production, investigate and develop resources, and for legal tender expenses of U.S. representatives, or for other purposes agreed by both parties. As for the repayment of loans, it will be paid for by Chinese products needed by the United States. The transportation of U.S. aid materials to China will mainly utilize U.S. ships. Materials subsidized by charitable relief organizations will be exempt from tariffs. The situation of China's acceptance and use of U.S. aid materials or funds, and the progress of the implementation of the agreement, will be reported to the United States every three months after the agreement is signed. The Chinese government should also provide necessary reports that are helpful to the aid to China plan at any time upon request from the United States. Regarding the termination of aid, in addition to the automatic termination due to the full implementation of the plan, if the U.S. government believes that the terms of the agreement have not been fulfilled, and that the aid has deviated from its original purpose, or that the situation has changed and the aid conflicts with U.S. interests, it will stop all aid plans. The various principles included in this Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement are roughly the same as those concluded between the United States and European countries. The technical issues regarding implementation will be left to the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee and U.S. representatives to discuss and decide at any time. As for the opening of ports for ships carrying U.S. aid materials in Jinghan and other places, the agreement does not involve it.

### Legislative Yuan Membership Issue Expected to Be Resolved, Lei Zhen Returned to Nanjing Yesterday to Report, Carrying Written Opinions from the Youth Party

[Our Newspaper Report] Lei Zhen, who mediated the dispute between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party over the number of seats in the Legislative Yuan, took a bus back to Nanjing on the evening of the 20th to report. Before leaving, Lei waited at his residence for reports from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party on the conclusion of their Central Standing Committee meetings. At 7 PM, he received a phone call from Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party, who stated that the meeting of the Democratic Socialist Party had concluded, and that their opinions on the Legislative Yuan issue were very close to those of the government. The party hoped that the Kuomintang could concede ten seats, so that the basic number of proponents (thirty) could be made up. In the future, if possible, they hoped that the party would still have fifty Legislative Yuan members participating. As for the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, and two Grand Justices and Examination Committee members each, the Democratic Socialist Party will not nominate candidates on its own initiative, but will accept them if the President issues an appointment order. At 9:15 PM, Lei received a phone call from Li Huang of the Youth Party, who stated that the meeting had resulted in a written opinion. Yan immediately went to Zuo Shunsheng's residence to collect it and then took the Beijing-Shanghai bus back to Nanjing. Before leaving, Lei had three phone calls with Zhang Qun, relaying the results of the Democratic Socialist Party and Youth Party meetings. Zhang is expected to stay in Shanghai for one or two more days; Wu Tiecheng returned to Nanjing with Lei on the same bus on the evening of the 20th.

### Lei's Remarks Before Departure

Before leaving, Lei Zhen told reporters at the station: The Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the Legislative Yuan is generally no longer a problem. When he went to the headquarters of the Youth Party on the 19th, they raised seven opinions, but some points were overemphasized, and he could not convey them to the government on behalf of the government. After explaining each point, he returned them and expressed the hope that the party would reconsider them. The party then convened another Central Standing Committee meeting on the 20th, revising the original seven opinions, and the attitude was more moderate than before. Although the content cannot be fully disclosed, what can be told is that the party has made a "turn" on various issues, so the Legislative Yuan issue may be resolved. As for the party's participation in the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuans, it will be resolved with the resolution of the Legislative Yuan membership issue. As for the party's hope that important political measures in the future must be decided after consultation among the three parties, he believes that it is not difficult to achieve, because if the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party participate in the Executive Yuan, then the two parties will have the right to advocate for political affairs. According to reporter inquiries, the seven opinions raised by the Youth Party are not very insistent on the number of Legislative Yuan members, but in order to compensate, they are doing their best to advocate that the government should guarantee that the party will participate in local governments.

Not to seek high office, but because I do not want to evade responsibility at this difficult and dangerous time. I will follow the spirit of obeying the leader and obey orders." He also said: "The Vice President of the Executive Yuan is a position with no real power, but I can use it to visit various places, inspect the people's conditions, and communicate between the central government and local governments." When the reporter asked about the current three-party cooperation issue, Zhang said: "The government has always adhered to the spirit of cooperation, hoping that the two parties will participate in the Executive Yuan. Currently, the Youth Party's Legislative Yuan membership issue is still being worked on. However, there may be delays in time, because it cannot be resolved in the short term. As for the Youth Party's participation in the government, discussions are currently underway on the cooperation issue in local governments, and some provincial government committee members may be given to them."

Editorial

### Seriously Addressing Several Realistic Problems of Shanghai

The Sixth Assembly of the Shanghai Municipal Council opens at 9:00 AM this morning, and will discuss various practical problems facing Shanghai. Various parties have proposed as many as 45 motions. In this time of great turmoil and widespread hardship, seeking local stability is fundamentally impossible. Especially in this international city teeming with foreigners, the social problems that arise are exceptionally complex and particularly worrying. Today, the lives of Shanghai citizens, be it in clothing, food, housing, or transportation, are all facing serious problems. Taking advantage of the opening of the Sixth Assembly of the Shanghai Municipal Council, we specifically raise several important and realistic problems for a comprehensive review, hoping to spark discussion and that the municipal councilors can use their collective wisdom to explore the future of Shanghai.

First, the issue of grain supply is not only related to the stability of people's livelihoods, but also closely related to the security of Shanghai. In the past week, rice prices have been rising daily, exceeding the ten million mark. Given this trend, the surge in rice prices seems endless, making all five million citizens of the city feel threatened by "white terror." As the saying goes, "Food is the paramount necessity of the people." If a proper solution to the grain supply problem cannot be found, not only will people's livelihoods be unstable and security be a concern, but also all other administrative matters will be out of the question. This council is meeting amidst the mad rise in rice prices, and should pay special attention to this increasingly serious food problem for the people. Shanghai is an industrial and commercial metropolis with a dense population, exceeding five million people according to recent statistics. However, Shanghai itself is not a land of fish and rice. Therefore, the grain for all five million citizens of the city must be obtained from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as imported rice from abroad. Logically, rice prices should exceed those in the producing areas. However, based on the highest rice prices last week, rice prices in this city are still lower than those in the producing areas, which must be attributed to the Civil Relief Association's allocation and sale of American rice. However, the source of American rice is ultimately limited. If the municipal government wants to rely entirely on American rice to maintain the people's food supply, it is reliable but not sustainable, and definitely not a long-term solution. Currently, American rice can still flow in, and the allocation and sale of American rice in this city will continue. However, concerns about the people's food problem cannot be ignored by the municipal government, and it should especially plan ahead and take precautions; otherwise, the grain supply problem will eventually become Shanghai's biggest worry. If the rice-grabbing trends in Changzhou and Ningbo spread to Shanghai, not only will security be impossible to maintain, but the entire industrial and commercial economy may also be dragged down. Therefore, we must raise special vigilance!

Second, crack down on speculative merchants and eradicate the artificial factors that cause price increases. Everyone admits that Shanghai is the economic center of the country and the source of price increases. Prices in all parts of the country almost entirely take Shanghai as the standard, especially in cities like Beijing and Hangzhou, where prices follow Shanghai's closely. The factors that cause price increases are certainly numerous, but behind every price increase, there are always artificial factors. These so-called artificial factors are the hoarding and speculation of speculative merchants, as well as engaging in black market transactions. Taking gold and currency as an example, financial authorities have repeatedly ordered the crackdown on gold and currency trading, but the black market for gold and currency still exists, and every price increase is led and promoted by gold and currency. The government has specifically established financial control bureaus in the five cities of Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Tianjin, responsible for cracking down on the black market for gold and currency and all other illegal trading. In Shanghai, since Director Li Lixia took office, there have been several concrete actions against black market gold speculation and arbitrage, cracking several major cases. However, "the wildfire cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows it back to life." Those engaged in speculative arbitrage and the black market for gold and currency remain unchanged. As a result, after Director Li resigned, the new director, Gao Fang, has not yet taken office, and the director's position is still vacant and being sought after. How can the work of managing finance and cracking down on speculation be allowed to stall when it urgently needs to be fully launched and highly developed? Speculation is an inevitable phenomenon in industrial and commercial cities, especially in today's Shanghai. However, if the municipal government does not find ways to crack down and allows a laissez-faire state, the consequences will not only constantly stimulate price increases, but also endanger the industry and commerce itself. Therefore, we cannot help but see the prevalence of speculation in Shanghai as a current concern, and demand that the municipal councilors face this crisis squarely and propose practical and effective measures to crack down on speculation!

Third, Shanghai's prosperity is a superficial prosperity, and cannot conceal its internal dilapidation. Moreover, the phenomenon of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer is becoming increasingly clear, and this fact cannot be denied. Therefore, on one side of Shanghai society, we see the wealthy indulging in extravagance, enjoying all the pleasures of urban material civilization; but on the other side of Shanghai society, we see the poor living inhuman lives. This contrast between the two extremes truly evokes the feeling of "behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine are left to rot, while on the road lie the bones of those who have starved to death." Shanghai is a paradise on earth, and at the same time, it is a hell on earth. In recent months, on the one hand, due to the recession in industry and commerce, many factories have been unable to maintain themselves and have had to close down, causing the number of unemployed workers to increase day by day; on the other hand, due to the expansion of war zones, refugees have flocked to Shanghai. The strong become bandits, and the weak become beggars. Although the municipal government has established refugee shelters, it cannot solve this serious problem. Refugees who are scantily clad fill the streets, which is not just a matter of urban appearance, but a serious security problem. Therefore, solving unemployment and providing relief to refugees is truly urgent. The Social Affairs Bureau has already been planning for this problem, but it has not yet been concretized. In any case, chanting "no giving campaigns" at this time is not a solution.

Finally, we must offer one more word to the municipal authorities: Our country's democratic constitutionalism has already stepped onto the right track, and the central political institutions have been reformed, presenting a new look. However, local political systems remain the same and have not changed, which is not compatible with the promotion of democratic constitutionalism in our country. Therefore, the municipal authorities should immediately actively prepare. As soon as the Legislative Yuan passes the provincial and county autonomy regulations, this city should immediately formulate municipal autonomy laws, first implement local autonomy, and elect a mayor, as a model for all provinces and cities in the country!

### Yang Mei Research Committee Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss New Phase of Examination Work

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Chongqing, 20th] The Yang Mei Research Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM this morning at No. 9 Jialing New Village. Committee members such as Hu Xianwen and Yuan Yinguang, who are related to nurses, participated and had a heated discussion on the Yang Mei incident, which will be re-examined starting on the 21st. It was unanimously agreed that Chongqing lacks instruments for metabolic examination and can only conduct preliminary clinical research. However, efforts should be made to ensure accuracy and caution. For example, scales and thermometers must be tested on time every day and measured with multiple scales to avoid errors. In addition, Yang Mei's room also has meteorological equipment to understand whether sunny or cloudy weather has an impact on Yang Mei. In short, the aim is to give foreign and domestic experts two impressions before they come to Chongqing: (1) There is a reliable preliminary record here. In-depth research can continue to explore along this line, avoiding repetitive and time-consuming work. (2) It is a fact that Yang Mei does not eat and does not have bowel movements. In short, there is no need to wait for foreign experts to uncover all the true and false situations.

### Xi'an Yang Mei, Fasting for Seven Years, Also Preparing for Examination

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Xi'an, 20th] Regarding Ms. Zhang Guiqing, who has been rumored in Chang'an for fasting for seven years, the Xi'an Municipal Citizens' Hospital sent personnel to investigate and has accepted her father's request to have her examined by the hospital soon to see if she is "Yang Mei the Second" or an incomplete refusal to eat due to a morbid condition. The reporter saw this 22-year-old red-clad girl, although she wore powder and rouge and permed her hair, her external secondary sexual characteristics seemed very subtle, and she did not express any reaction to matters of men and women. According to her father, Zhang's first menstruation was at the age of thirteen, but it was immediately interrupted and has continued until now. This seems to be a phenomenon caused by malnutrition affecting sexual function, which is different from Yang Mei in Chongqing. Ms. Zhang started at the age of sixteen, due to a period of shock and fear, she was unwilling to eat food, and if she reluctantly ate, she felt great pain and had to vomit it all out. She currently has poor muscle development, a flat abdomen, almost no bowel movements, and little urination. She usually likes to do needlework, likes to breathe fresh air, and dislikes noisy and bustling environments. All these phenomena are very similar to Yang Mei. Ms. Zhang drinks two cups of boiled water three times a day, in the morning, at noon, and before going to bed. She adds two small spoons of white sugar before going to bed once, and occasionally eats some fruit, but a small pear is enough to eat for three days and is not essential. In addition, she has absolutely no fat, starch, or protein entering her abdomen. How can this meager food support the long-term excess of physical heat? If this interesting question is solved, it will help to reveal or deny the mystery of the Yang Mei type.

### Commemorating Longshan: The National Army Establishes an Eastern Barrier for Greater Jinan; Bandits Fought for Three Days and Four Nights Before Finally Abandoning Guns and Throwing Away Bullets

[Our Newspaper Jinan 16th Dispatch by Air] By chance, I commemorated the Longshan Railway Station and its surrounding areas, 35 kilometers away from Jinan, at noon today, just ten hours after it was still a battlefield. Here, the National Army fought fiercely with the Communist bandits for three days and four nights. It was not until two hours before dawn today that the bandit Bohai Column, after suffering more than 5,000 casualties, abandoned their bullets, threw away their guns, and fled in disarray. They fled north through Zhangqiu, resulting in the National Army's first victory since the Changwei Campaign in the Shandong theater.

Both Sides' Deployments: The National Army's deployment in this area was one regiment stationed in Longshan and Shancheng Village to the southeast; one regiment in Loujia Sih, north of Longshan; two regiments in Liguanzhuang to the northwest; and one regiment in Wulitang to the southwest, totaling five regiments. The total force used by the Communist bandits this time was the bandit Bohai Column's Yuan Yeli's units, including the New 7th, 11th, and 13th three divisions, as well as the Independent 14th, 15th, and 16th Regiments, totaling twelve regiments. After using five regiments as reserves, the first wave used seven regiments, of which three regiments attacked Loujia Sih, Liguanzhuang, and Wulitang, respectively, to contain the National Army in each area and prevent the National Army in each area from reinforcing Longshan and Xiaocheng Village. The main force of four regiments besieged Longshan and Shancheng Village, less than one li to the southeast. The battle broke out simultaneously at 8:00 PM on the 12th. The bandits' initial attempt was to eliminate the Tan Xinghuang Regiment of the Qian Boying Brigade stationed in Longshan and Shancheng Village. The bandit leader, the commander of the Bohai Column, held a meeting for three days, believing that he could still use his old tactics of "besieging the city and attacking reinforcements" and "using the big to eat the small" to "eat" the Tan Regiment and then change into new equipment. Regiment Commander Tan believed that the Longshan area was vast and the force of one regiment was too weak, so he changed to defending the high ground Shancheng Village in the southeast of Longshan with the main force, while using two companies to provide mobile support outside.

Recapturing Longshan: Due to its weak forces, Longshan fell into the hands of the bandits on the night of the 12th. With the loss of Longshan, the rear connection of Shancheng Village was cut off. The bandits then concentrated their forces to besiege Shancheng Village. Regiment Commander Tan feared that because the troops had only arrived at the station for two days, they could only rely on the most hasty field fortifications to resist. By the morning of the 13th, Brigade Commander Qian Boying, fearing that Regiment Tan would be lost, personally led the other two regiments of his unit from Jinan. After traveling 70 li a day to reach the battlefield, he launched a flanking counter-encirclement against Longshan. After more than 20 hand-to-hand combats, he finally recaptured Longshan Town at 12:00 PM that night. At this time, the bandit siege of Shancheng Village became even fiercer, attempting to occupy Shancheng Village before the Longshan National Army could recover from its fatigue. However, they could not withstand the joint attack from the National Army in the two areas. The bandit's four-regiment force suffered nearly half of its losses and had to retreat northeast of Longshan before dawn on the 15th. At the same time, the bandits attacking Loujia Sih, Wulitang, and other places also retreated one after another after being defeated.

Attacking Yujiazhuang: The bandits first retreated to the Dajiazhuang, Yujiazhuang, Taipingzhuang, Ershilibao, Huangsanyuan area, about six or seven kilometers to ten kilometers northeast of Longshan. Brigade Commander Qian, in the process of expanding the results of the battle and pursuing, also recovered the remnants of the Bandit New 7th Division that had fled to Ganjiazhuang. It was completely recovered at 2:00 AM on the 16th. The National Army in that village alone used as many as a thousand shells. A staff officer told me that at the current market price, an average shell costs 200 million yuan. Brigade Commander Qian personally went to a position 100 meters east of the village to command the battle of attacking Yujiazhuang. The bandit's machine gun killed his orderly who was close to him and wounded his adjutant, but Brigade Commander Qian was unharmed.

New Graves Piled High: When I inspected Longshan, I saw that all the houses were either destroyed by artillery fire or by incendiary bombs, with bullet marks everywhere and corpses everywhere. When the breeze passed, the indescribable strange smell interwoven with the burnt smell of the burned houses and the stench of corpses, even now thinking about it, still makes people nauseous. From Longshan to Shancheng Village, trenches crisscrossed, and there were even more accumulated corpses. New graves piled high were everywhere. Brigade Commander Qian told me that the bandits originally tried their best to drag back the corpses and bury them themselves, but this time because the National Army advanced quickly and the offensive was strong, they did not have time to drag them away. Our original plan was to bury all the bandit corpses today, but later we heard that you were coming, in order to let you understand the intensity of the battle, so we decided to wait until you had seen them before burying them.

Lord Guan Fell: Traveling north from Shancheng Village to Yujiazhuang, of the more than 300 households in the village, few complete buildings remained. The Guandi Temple west of the village was also destroyed by artillery fire. Lord Guan was covered in bullet marks and fell on the side of the broken wall. Inside and outside the village, bullet craters were as dense as honeycombs. Because the battlefield had not yet been cleaned up, bullet casings, shrapnel, military caps, and leggings were everywhere. There were also unexploded shells buried in the mud with one end and exposed outside the soil with the other end, so when we passed by, we were all cautious. The bandit corpses were also left for us to visit and were not completely buried. Flies gathered, and the stench of corpses and the smell of gunpowder were mixed together, creating another unpleasant atmosphere. There was a small Catholic Church in the village. Although the doors, windows, and roof were covered with bullet marks, they were largely intact because of the solid construction. The statue of Saint Maria was still hanging in the chapel, solemn and benevolent, as always, seemingly a symbol of peace after the war. When leaving the village, we saw groups of horses and carts transporting large quantities of newly harvested wheat westward. Someone asked him where he was transporting it to. He said: "This time, the Eighth Route Army almost robbed all of our wheat. If the National Army hadn't chased them quickly, I'm afraid even these would have been robbed by the Eighth Route Army long ago."

Officers and Soldiers United: The entire 73rd Division was completely reorganized from local Shandong teams after being "eaten" in the Laiwu Tusikou battle on February 23rd last year. Due to the lack of combat experience, everyone has always been hesitant to make overly high assessments of its combat power. However, in recent years, due to the practical training of generals such as Cao Zhenduo and Qian Boying, and more importantly, due to the practical implementation of the new work style movement advocated by Wang Yaowu, the most satisfactory results have been achieved in this battle of Longshan. On the way back from the battlefield inspection, a lower-ranking military officer said it well: "Only the battlefield is the most democratic and the most egalitarian place. Regardless of officers and soldiers, as long as they are on the front line, the opportunities for eating, living, using, and even dying are all equally equal. Only when you get to the rear, the lives of officers and soldiers are isolated and become two absolutely disparate classes of people." But the military officer went on to say: "The above is just a thing of the past. Since Commander Wang advocated the new work style movement, the lives of officers and soldiers have been integrated. Everyone goes to the drill ground, goes to the lecture hall, rests together, eats communal meals together, and even goes to the battlefield together. The officers fear the soldiers like parents fear their children. How can a unit in this situation not win battles?"

Due to the victory of the Longshan battle, as Division Commander Cao of the division said, it increased his confidence in the original combat power of the unit by more than two times. At the same time, it also stabilized the mood of the 700,000 citizens of Jinan City, which was surrounded. A strong barrier has been established here on the eastern side of Greater Jinan City.

### Republican National Convention Opens in Philadelphia Today; To Elect Next Presidential Candidate

[Central News Agency Philadelphia 20th] The world's attention is focused on Philadelphia today. This historic city has been prepared as the venue for the opening of the Republican National Convention tomorrow. The outcome of this convention is likely to determine the U.S. foreign policy for the next four years. After sixteen years of continuous rule by the Democratic Party, according to various indications, the Republican Party is about to rise again and take charge of the national government. The Republican presidential nominee, regardless of who it is, will have a significant impact on the fate of the party and the American people. Considering the importance of the United States in the post-war world, it is also of great significance to the whole world.

Republican politicians from all over the country are gathering at this meeting. They are deeply convinced that the party will win the general election in November, so they are expressing great optimism, which was rarely seen during the Roosevelt administration.

Among the noises before the Republican National Convention, the following developments are noteworthy: (1) New York Governor Dewey still ranks high in this year's Republican presidential candidate competition. Senator Taft and former Minnesota Governor Stassen follow behind, but it is expected that no one will be able to obtain the required 548 votes for nomination in the first vote. (2) Four to ten votes will need to be held at this conference before the presidential nomination can be determined. (3) In addition to the above three, Senate Speaker Vandenberg is also a possible candidate often mentioned. (4) The final decision will be in the hands of Republican power figures, especially the leaders of the so-called major delegations, such as those from Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. (5) In the first and second votes, the above delegations are expected to vote for their delegation leaders, but this is just a gesture of support.

Smugglers are carrying large sums of old mark banknotes, with one person carrying 50,000 old marks (equivalent to 10,000 pounds).

### Internal Strife Eliminated, Labor Unrest Overcome: French Cabinet's Position Stabilized; One-Hour General Strike Nationwide Without Incident

[United Press Paris 19th] The Schumann Cabinet's position was further consolidated on the 19th after eliminating internal cabinet strife and overcoming the labor unrest crisis. At the same time, according to reliable sources, Schumann has decided not to change his cabinet lineup, including Foreign Minister Bidault. Schumann and the two cabinet members who caused the dispute by criticizing "economic policies that will lead to the government's collapse" met for two and a half hours. The Prime Minister finally reached a compromise agreement with Finance Minister Mayer and Labor Minister Daniel.

[United Press Paris 19th] French workers went on a one-hour general strike today to support the striking workers in the rubber industry in Clermont-Ferrand, but no accidents occurred. In Paris, city traffic was once suspended until the strike ended at noon.

### British Organizes Air Passenger Transport Between Berlin and West German Occupation Zone; German Communist Manifesto Resolves to Seek German Reunification

[Reuters Berlin 19th] Since the Soviet authorities ordered the blockade of land and water passenger traffic between West Germany and the Soviet occupation zone to prevent new and old marks from flowing into the Soviet zone, it is estimated that more than 5,000 Western Allied and German passengers have been blocked at the British military zone border near Helmstedt. The line of cars is as long as "the eye can see". Soviet officials at the border only allow Soviets and Yugoslavs living in the Soviet zone to enter the Soviet zone from West Germany; all other people are refused entry. Because the Soviet authorities' blockade order does not apply to air and land freight transport, British authorities began organizing air passenger transport between Berlin and West Germany on the 19th. Although freight trains traveling from West Germany to Berlin are not prohibited, Soviet inspectors are conducting strict inspections of goods and personnel on the trains to prevent the smuggling of old marks, which are useless in West Germany but still valid in East Germany. Therefore, all trains are delayed for a long time. A U.S. official in Berlin, referring to the Soviet authorities' blockade of traffic, said that when the monetary reform is implemented in the Soviet zone, the U.S. occupation zone authorities will deal with it in the same way. However, British officials admitted that "until there is evidence to the contrary, this move by the Soviet authorities is a necessary precaution to prevent currency smuggling."

[United Press Berlin 19th] The German People's Council controlled by the Communist Party in the Soviet occupation zone today claimed to be the legitimate representative of the German people and announced that it would promote various measures to lay the foundation for a united German republic and win the people's support in West Germany. Qualified observers agree that this move is the Soviet Union and the German Communist Party's response to the six-nation conference in London's decision to establish a West German government. It is also the German Communist Party's intention, with the Soviet Union as its backer, to organize a government in Berlin and demand national recognition.

### French Occupation Zone in Germany: Closes Swiss Border

Advocates Adopting Collective Security System

[Central News Agency London 19th] British Minister of State McNeil reiterated at the annual meeting of the United Nations Association today that the United Nations Charter remains the basis of British foreign policy. He said that if the United Nations can be a tool for advancing work one day, then the United Nations will continue to be the institution chosen by the British government to advance its policies. McNeil advocated that all countries, including the Soviet Union, have the right to organize regional security alliances with neighboring countries, but they must be strictly defensive in nature.

### Italian Communist Leader Arrives in Rome; Rumored to Meet with Zhdanov; This Trip Expected to Trigger Italian Communist Rectification Movement

[Reuters Prague 19th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti arrived in Prague on the 17th from Rome, and on the 18th he went to the Romanian capital. The rumor that Togliatti will meet with Zhdanov, the secretary-general of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and the founder of the Communist International, has not been confirmed or denied.

[Reuters Rome 19th] People at the Italian Communist Party headquarters in Rome remain tight-lipped about the whereabouts of Italian Communist leader Togliatti and Communist Senator Secchia. Observers here believe that Togliatti's trip abroad will trigger a rectification movement along the lines of the U.S. Communist Party, and the name "People's Front" may be abolished, so the left-wing Socialist Party participating in the People's Front may be excluded. People in Rome believe that since the Communist Party encountered setbacks in the Italian general election, European Communist Parties will adopt stricter party rules and will begin launching violent movements in Western Europe to undermine the European recovery program, which is still in the development stage.

### Afro-Asian Conference Opens in Paris

[Reuters Paris 20th] The Afro-Asian Conference convened by the left-wing Socialist Parties of Britain, France, India, Vietnam, and Africa opened this morning in Bito, near Paris. British Independent Labour Party Chairman Edwards addressed the meeting, advocating the organization of a third group of nations in Western Europe, Asia, and Africa as a buffer between the United States and the Soviet Union. He said that if the nations of these regions are driven into either of the opposing camps of the United States and the Soviet Union, freedom will be lost and war will be inevitable. The first step in realizing this great plan will be to unite the socialist parties of the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Times have changed, and colonial nations are moving towards complete freedom. European socialist parties should join hands with colonial nations on an equal footing to establish a connection between the great centers of Asian and African nations and European cultural and industrial activities.

### Chilean Communist Party Activities: Military and Police Strictly on Alert

### Japanese Prime Minister Ashida Declares: Will Restrict Left-Wing Activities

[United Press Tokyo 20th] Prime Minister Ashida told Congress on the 20th that if the recent labor movement in Japan is "excessive," the government will have to take some measures to restrict left-wing activities, because the recent labor unrest may lead to the collapse of the recovery plan. His warning came after the continuous strikes by transport workers and the announcement by a powerful capitalist organization that it would raise 100 million yen to implement a plan to crack down on left-wing elements.

### Philippine Labor Nationalization Bill: Quirino Vetoes It

Believes It Violates the Spirit of Sino-Philippine Friendship

[Reuters London 19th] Sudan Governor-General Howe has issued an order to establish an administrative committee and elect a legislative assembly. This is the first step towards autonomy for this North African land with 7,000 square miles and a population of 7 million. The British government has approved this system as a result of long-term negotiations in Cairo and Khartoum (the capital of Sudan). However, the Egyptian government believes that this system is equivalent to continuing the Anglo-Egyptian condominium system and has not recognized that Sudan should be placed under the rule of the Egyptian king, and has not yet agreed to it.

### Huge Explosion in Cairo Jewish Quarter

Many Dead and Injured, Cause Unknown

France has also agreed to supply the medium cruiser "Ãmile Bertin" to perform the same task during the ceasefire. Belgium, the third country requested by Bernadotte to supply coastal patrol vessels, replied that it was unable to comply. The United States also requested that its destroyers and other ships not use any force or obstruct any ships they encounter, in order to avoid accusations from Israel that the United States is interfering in Jewish immigration matters.

[United Press, Cairo, 19th] The former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, stated that he still insisted on establishing a unified Arab Palestine. At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, also stated that the Arab League leaders had decided to reject any plan to establish a Jewish state.

[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 19th] Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett addressed the Jewish Party Congress today, detailing the overall situation, saying that our attitude has made it clear to the United Nations mediator that the State of Israel and its sovereignty are inviolable. He also stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to assist the State of Israel, but this does not mean that we must join the world conflict. We must resist Britain's attempts against Israel and hope that another British government can understand our principles.

### Talking About the European Situation

â Ben Geng

Will War Break Out? (1)

The Second World War has been over for more than two years in fact, but not only are the main peace treatiesâwith Japan and Germanyâstill elusive, but the whole world, especially the European continent, seems to be brewing for another war. In less than a year, the European continent has gone from the proposal of the Marshall Plan and the refusal of Eastern European countries to participate, through the establishment of the Cominform, the organization of the Greek anti-government army, the breakdown of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' London Conference, the signing of the Five-Power Treaty, the Czech coup and the suicide of Jan Masaryk, the Soviet protest against the United States' military advisors in Iran, the proposal to revise the peace treaty with Italy, and the recent traffic problems in the British and American occupied areas of Berlin. The occurrence of each problem, while one side indicates a reversal of the situation, the other side more or less deepens the tension in Europe. The opposing situation has more or less been established.

On one side is the Eastern European group centered on the Soviet Union, including about ten countries; on the other side are the sixteen Western European countries centered on the Marshall Plan from the Five-Power Treaty. Although some countries remain, they do not seem to be able to play a role in easing the situation, and even these countries may not be able to survive for long outside the two major camps. Some people compare today's situation to the eve of the two world wars in 1914 and 1938, but one thing is very different from 1914 and 1938, that is, on the eve of the wars in 1914 and 1938, the United States was somewhat aloof. Now, although the geographical distance is still the same as before, politically the United States has not only participated in the disputes in Europe, but is also one of the most important protagonists.

The current situation is that there are indeed many problems that have arisen but have not been resolved, and problems that are about to occur and may occur at any time seem to be everywhere. Therefore, some people are discussing or wondering whether war is about to break out again?

(2)

I don't think we need to answer this question directly, but just analyze the possibility of war.

Those who believe that war is about to break out have roughly the following reasons: Although the current international situation is complex, if we simplify it, the entire situation is the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union. This opposition represents two different social systems and ideologies, and war is unavoidable. Since it is unavoidable, it can naturally break out at any time. A detailed analysis shows that there are several factors that may cause war to break out soon. First, both sides, whether based on "self-defense" or other reasons, are clearly taking various means to defend against each other. This kind of tit-for-tat, although the chess players are only laying out the board, the tighter it becomes. If any move of the chess is seen by you as self-defense or you estimate that the other party can tolerate it, but in fact the other party believes that it exceeds self-defense or believes that it cannot be tolerated, war may follow. It now seems to have reached the point where it is getting tighter and tighter. Second, the United States may confidently believe that its economic power is sufficient to immediately support a large-scale war, and it is now the only country that openly possesses the atomic bomb. Thus, if it believes that war is inevitable, it may hope to fight before the other side's strength is abundant. Assuming that some people in the United States really have this idea (of course, this assumption seems very possible to some people), then war will naturally not be too far away. Third, on the Soviet side, there are two opposing situations that may cause it to create war. One is that the Soviet Union may also already have the atomic bomb (it was once rumored that the Soviet Union tested the atomic bomb in Siberia last summer), or perhaps although it does not have the atomic bomb, it believes that the atomic bomb is not enough to determine the outcome of the war, or perhaps it underestimates the amount of atomic bombs currently possessed by the United States. On the European continent, the Soviet Union may confidently believe that it is "invincible." In this situation, it may make the Soviet Union feel that since war is inevitable, it is better to strike first rather than wait for the revival of Western European countries. The other is that the Soviet Union may overestimate the power of the United States, causing it to involuntarily expand its "sphere of survival" without limit. This unlimited expansion of the "sphere of survival," whether subjectively for "security" or not, will objectively force the early arrival of war. (To be continued)

In addition, twelve more proposals from council members were delivered yesterday. Excerpts of the reasons for the proposals are as follows: Two proposals from Zhang Zhihan: (1) Request the municipal government to pay attention to the serious situation in the Pudong suburbs and closely cooperate with the Jiangsu provincial government and the garrison headquarters to prevent problems before they occur. (2) Propose that the assembly, on behalf of the city, send a telegram to the National Assembly representatives and legislators produced by this city, requesting them to oppose the unreasonable demands of a small number of public representatives who disregard the hardships of the people's livelihood and extravagantly demand personal treatment from the government.

### Current Crisis of National Goods Factories; Appealing to the Central Government to Resolutely Save Them

The Shanghai National Goods Factories Federation, in order to seek solutions to the actual difficulties of national goods factories, recently telegraphed relevant departments of the central government, appealing to the facts and putting forward four requests, earnestly requesting a swift rescue to avoid collapse. The four requests are recorded below:

(1) Open up production loans so that general national goods factories can obtain periodic low-interest loans, reduce the exploitation of usury, and reduce costs. At the same time, please restore industrial and mining loans to engage in production and construction in order to gradually seek price stability. (2) Open up the exchange settlement policy. At a time when exports are sharply reduced and imports are excessively surpassed, in order to save this crisis, foreign exchange should be opened up through proper channels to encourage exports, especially special imported products, such as iridium (tariff number 240) for making fountain pen tips and celluloid (tariff number 664B), the main raw material for making pen holders. The Import Control Committee should open up foreign exchange from time to time to facilitate domestic factories to manufacture and resist the dumping of foreign goods. (3) Relax the rationing of raw materials. The quantity of cotton yarn raw materials allocated by the Textile Control Committee each period for simple weaving factories and cotton textile copying industries is not very large, and they have to seek them from the black market, increasing costs and hindering production. Please relax the rationing as much as possible to avoid shortages. For other materials such as dyes and caustic soda bleaching powder required for indanthrene, diesel oil for the glass industry, by-products used by food factories, and raw materials required by the rubber industry, the quantity is insufficient due to limited quotas. Please relax them specially to supply production. (4) Reduce or stop electricity. Factories located in Zhabei, Nanshi, Hongkou, and the old eight districts of this city often have power outages every week. In the event of other accidents, power must be cut off at any time, and the salaries of factory workers are calculated on a daily basis, resulting in invisible losses and seriously affecting production. Please ask the Public Utilities Bureau to specifically restrict power plants from arbitrarily cutting off power and relieve the power shortage to maintain industrial production and avoid increasing costs.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Holds Joint Sea-Land Transportation Between Beijing and Tianjin

The Service Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company urgently needs to promote service work. Recently, service departments have been established in the Hankou, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Hong Kong branch offices to handle passenger transportation and passenger services. The Guangzhou branch office is also being organized. In addition, the sea-land combined transportation matters previously discussed by the department with the two railway bureaus have now been scheduled to begin on July 1. Passengers traveling from Nanjing to Tianjin will have all their boat tickets issued by the Nanjing Station of the two railway bureaus. Passengers can hand over their luggage to the Nanjing Station and pick it up in Tianjin. It is convenient and safe. Passengers traveling from Tianjin to Shanghai and Beijing will have all train tickets for the Beijing-Shanghai Line sold by the Tianjin China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. However, this combined transportation is temporarily limited to first class. If it is handled successfully and satisfactorily in the future, second and third classes will be added to make it popular among the public. As for combined sea-air transportation, the department is also negotiating with China National Aviation Corporation.

### Mayor and Others Discuss and Decide to Continue Selling Rice This Week

Mayor Wu convened Ren Xianxuan, chairman of the Civil Affairs Committee, Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and others yesterday morning to discuss and decide that in order to increase the supply of food rice in the market and stabilize rice prices, the sale and supply of food rice will continue this week in the North and South Markets. The quantity will still be set at 6,000 shi every other day, and the price will remain at 9.2 million yuan.

### Rice Merchants Call for Exemption from Business Tax on Buying and Selling on Behalf of Customers

The Rice Merchants Bureau Guild of this city believes that the authorities will levy a business tax on buying and selling on behalf of customers, forcibly banishing food merchants who buy and sell on behalf of customers to the ranks of brokers, and exploiting the legitimate qualifications of the original food merchants. Since the food business tax has already been exempted, it is inappropriate to suddenly levy a disguised business tax on buying and selling on behalf of customers. Yesterday, it specially presented reasons to the authorities requesting approval for exemption. Also, the Shanghai representatives Qu Zhenhua, Xing Zhigang, Zhang Chao, etc. of the National Food Industry Federation's delegation to Beijing to petition, returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is heard that Hou Tingdu, Duan Jianmin of the Tianliang Committee of the Legislative Yuan, Guan Jiwang, Minister of Food, and others separately received them this time requesting exemption from food tax, and the result was quite satisfactory.

### Da De Money Shop Investigated; Deputy Manager Dismissed by Order

### Two Ships Loaded with Coal Stored in Qinhuangdao Can Arrive in Shanghai Today

Since the recent destruction of the railway transportation between the coal mining area and Qinhuangdao due to war, the transportation of coal produced in Kaiping to Shanghai is facing a serious problem again. According to the Fuel Management Department, the extent of the damage this time is more serious than before, and it may be difficult to repair it in a short period of time. The association is currently working with the Ministry of Communications to establish other methods of coal transportation to avoid concerns about the source of fuel coal. As for the 15,000 tons of coal stored in Qinhuangdao, it has been fully loaded by the "New China" and "Tianping" ships and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.

In addition, in order to enrich the coal balls required by public teachers and industrial workers in this city next month, the association has purchased another batch of 6,000 tons of white coal from Hongji, Vietnam, which will arrive tomorrow morning.

### Trial Voyage on the Qiantang River Successful; Jiangnan Ship Returns to Shanghai This Morning

[Reported from Hangzhou on the 20th] The Jiangnan ship, which successfully completed its trial voyage on the Qiantang River, is scheduled to return to Shanghai at 5:00 a.m. tomorrow. Today, Deputy Director Wang of the Tanggong Bureau and Zhou Nian of the China Trust Bureau entertained reporters on the ship and sailed to Sibao to demonstrate the ship's performance.

In addition, the wharf that will be used for official navigation in the future will be changed to Baihu Mountain, and a 20-kilometer branch line will be built from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to the wharf.

### Customs Employees Issue the Truth about the Work Slowdown

[Reported by this newspaper] The work slowdown incident of all customs employees has not yet been resolved. In order to clarify the truth about the work slowdown, the employee representatives of the office issued a statement yesterday, saying: "The treatment of customs is far worse than that of the four banks, two bureaus, and the post office. In order to strive for a thorough improvement in treatment, a welfare association was organized. The treatment was improved with reference to the methods of the four banks and two bureaus, and the proposal has been put forward for a long time. Former Minister Yu and the Chief Inspector of Customs also promised in person that they would strive for it with the minister as soon as the government reorganization was completed. Recently, prices have soared, and the lives of colleagues have been on the verge of desperation. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, all colleagues signed and submitted a request to the authorities to borrow a month's salary for relief. The authorities did not respond. Because of the pressure of life, the welfare association representatives again requested to see the Chief Inspector of Customs on the afternoon of the 18th of this month, requesting three points on behalf of all colleagues: (1) The welfare association organized to improve treatment should be legal. (2) Request that the treatment of customs be changed with reference to the methods of the four banks and two bureaus. Before the improvement, officials should be paid 2.6 shi of rice allowance, and workers should be paid 1.6 shi. (3) Borrow one month's salary for relief. The authorities did not give a satisfactory answer to these three requests. The welfare representatives were forced to resign collectively, and the negotiations reached a deadlock. On the afternoon of the same day, customs work came to a standstill. On the 19th, because the authorities still did not give a concrete reply, this situation continued for another day. On the 20th, it was reported that the Jianghai Customs had partially resumed work at 4:00 p.m. This statement solemnly declares that this news is inaccurate. All of our employees have decided to persist to the end unless a satisfactory answer is obtained to the three requests. The responsibility for the losses caused by this incident rests entirely with the customs authorities. The employees are forced by life, and in order to thoroughly improve treatment to avoid recurrence, we believe that we can obtain the understanding and sympathy of all parties. In addition, The China Press and The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury distorted the facts and slandered the pure request of the customs colleagues to improve treatment. In addition to briefly expressing their ulterior motives, it is not worth a knowledgeable person's smile."

### Shanghai Branch of the Law Society Holds Annual Meeting and Passes a Proposal to Recommend the Implementation of a Crime Prevention Policy

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the Law Society of the Republic of China held its third annual meeting at the Youth Middle School on Linsen Middle Road yesterday morning. More than 60 members attended, including He Shizhen, Cha Liangjian, Huang Liang, Sheng Zhenwei, Guo Wei, Shan Yuhua, Xu Tuhao, Liu Junling, Tang Shichang, and Ji Hao. Wu Xianglin, director of the general assembly, and Zhang Zhiben, executive director of the general assembly, attended the meeting to provide guidance. After the opening was announced, He Shizhen was publicly elected as chairman. After performing the ceremony, Wu Xianglin first delivered a speech, saying that Director Ju Zheng was unable to attend due to business, so he specially wrote a speech and sent him to read it. The content was roughly: "The third annual meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Society is being held at the beginning of the implementation of constitutional government. The consistent purpose of the Society is to elucidate the essence of world law and guide the modern spirit of the rule of law. We hope that the Society will devote itself to three tasks in the future: (1) Imparting basic knowledge of law, (2) Exploring the content of current laws, (3) Establishing a system of Chinese law." Zhang Zhiben then delivered a speech, saying: "Suppressing the rebellion is not only a military issue, but also a rule of law issue. If China can embark on the path of the rule of law, the issue of the Communist bandits who violate the law and discipline can be eradicated. Therefore, in this period of suppressing the rebellion and implementing the constitution, our responsibility is extremely important."

### Three Proposals Passed

Then, three proposals were discussed: (1) Judicial administration should still be under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan to emphasize the constitution and clarify the judicial system. (2) Various special criminal laws should be carefully considered and incorporated into the criminal law and the army, navy, and air force criminal law to facilitate the people's compliance. (3) Please suggest that the judicial authorities thoroughly implement the crime prevention policy and enrich the content of prisons. The Society will appoint members to visit prisons in various places nearby, submit reports, and provide reference for the judicial authorities. All three of the above proposals were passed and submitted to the general assembly to suggest that the government adopt and implement them.

Then, the issue of membership fees was discussed. Each member will first collect a membership fee of 200,000 yuan and a printing fee of 100,000 yuan for the member manual. As for the proposal put forward by the members to collect membership fees based on two yuan and according to the cost of living index, it will be sent to the current board of directors for research and implementation. At the venue, Liu Junling, Tang Shichang, Jiang Baoli, Zhang Qieping, Shi Naixiu and other members each recognized a special donation of 1 million yuan.

The supervisors are Guo YunGuan, Liang Jianbo and other nine people. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 p.m.

### To Prevent Funds from North China from Coming to Shanghai; Three National Bank Members to Fly to Beiping and Tianjin Today; To Discuss Improvement of Exchange Restrictions with Local Relevant Agencies

It is now learned that Xia, Li, and Wang have decided to fly to Beiping and Tianjin by plane this morning to handle everything. According to the person in charge of the National Bank, after the three arrive in North China, they will consult with the military, political, and financial agencies in Beiping and Tianjin to improve the exchange restriction measures to reduce the smuggling of cash to Shanghai. Since the implementation of exchange restrictions, funds from Beiping and Tianjin have been using sea routes to smuggle cash south, and the amount is considerable, so it is necessary to improve them to prevent the northern funds from becoming depleted. At the same time, the National Bank and related parties have begun to transport a large amount of materials to North China for sale and issue treasury bonds in Beiping and Tianjin to absorb funds locally.

### The Cigarette Industry Responds One After Another; Recognizing a Special Donation of 200 Billion

Since the start of soliciting special donations for relief, all sectors of industry and commerce in this city have responded one after another, and the results have been very good. It is now learned that the cigarette industry has also recognized a donation of 200 billion yuan. The distribution method for each factory is based on the amount of foreign exchange earned from the third phase of tobacco leaves. China Tobacco Company is 10 billion yuan, and Fuxin, Nanyang, Dadongnan, Huaming and other cigarette factories have each recognized a donation of tens of billions or hundreds of billions. All the directors, shareholders, managers, factory directors and employees of each department of this donation will be allocated.

### Huge Losses in Oil Distribution to Public Teachers; China Plant Appeals to the Government for Relief

The board of directors of China Vegetable Oil Factory held a monthly meeting at the Jinmen Hotel at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. After a long discussion on the matter of contracting the distribution of edible oil to public teachers in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, it was resolved that the accumulated losses incurred by the factory in contracting the distribution of oil to public teachers up to May amounted to 150 billion yuan. If calculated in kind, the loss is even greater, and it is unable to pad it further. It was decided that the factory's management department should submit a report to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Beijing and Shanghai Municipal Governments, reporting the difficult situation and formulating remedial measures. If the government has no concrete measures, starting from July (that is, the distribution of oil to public teachers in June), it will not be able to continue to contract the distribution of oil to public teachers in the Beijing and Shanghai areas.

### Fire in JiangSu Road Shantytown: Child Dies, Two Injured

[Report from our newspaper] A sudden fire broke out in the shantytown at the end of Yangjia Lane on the Dongzhuanbang of JiangSu Road around 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Black smoke billowed into the sky, and flames soared.  Although all the workers of the nearby Taili Machinery Factory used their own water hoses to connect to water and try to put out the fire, they were unable to do so due to the ferocity of the fire.  In an instant, more than ten shacks were completely burned down.  Twelve small handicraft factories in adjacent wooden houses, including TongYi Gong, QiTong, Zhang Pingan, and Li DaDuo cloth and machine factories, were also affected and destroyed.  Fire departments from the JingAn Temple and HuaShan districts rushed to the scene with several fire trucks after hearing the news.  The fire was brought under control after about an hour.  A firefighter from the HuaShan district, Zhu Xiufen (28 years old), fell from an upper floor, injuring her head and legs.  She was later sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Shi Weiwu, a worker from the ChangKun Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 4 Xinglongfang, bravely helped with the rescue but was also burned on his face and hands.  It is reported that the fire was caused by the wife of a shantytown resident, Liu Shiying, who went out to buy rationed rice after cooking lunch, without fully extinguishing the fire. Sparks flew into the shack and immediately ignited it.  A three-month-old baby sleeping in the bed was burned to death.  At the time, one person was caught looting during the fire and was arrested and sent to the police station for punishment.  According to a post-incident investigation, there were 24 households and 9 families with fields and 23 households and 3 families with businesses affected.  Police officers from the police station escorted all victims to the JingAn Temple Police Station for questioning. Liu Shiying, the one responsible for the fire, was also arrested and the case was submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Workers' Comfort Payment Method: Soldiers Association to Request Reconsideration

Regarding the method for workers to pay this year's comfort payments for new recruits, the Social Affairs Bureau previously convened a meeting and decided that draftees of eligible age should pay comfort payments in the amount of five "dou" of the lowest grade of rice, and workers without conscripted family members should pay the originally set amount of 200,000 yuan. After this method was promulgated and implemented in various districts, the Soldiers Association recently received reports from various districts stating that the above method was inappropriate. In industrial areas with a large number of workers, the comfort payments collected were less than the prescribed quota. Therefore, the Soldiers Association will send a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting a re-examination and will announce its implementation within days.

### Bund Park: Plotting Mischief, Gang of Robbers Caught

[Report from our newspaper] On the 17th of this month, around 5:00 PM, the Hongkou Camp Branch received a tip that a gang of robbers was hiding in the Bund Park, plotting mischief and attempting to rob the property of the fruit store at No. 161 Huashan Road. They immediately ordered officers to disguise themselves and go undercover, arresting the gang of robbers Jin Abao, Zhou Pixun, Xi Pinshan, Shen Bin, Wang Kunlang, Shi Zhong, Shi Jinxiang, and Shi Xushi, a total of eight people. They were taken to the station for interrogation. Later, a revolver and several bullets were found near the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office in Pudong, Fengxian, and Nanhui counties. The suspects confessed to three crimes: (1) On May 29th, they robbed the home of Yin Daoyu at No. 8 Baijie 3rd Lane, DaNanmen in the South City; (2) On June 1st, they robbed the Ziyang Tea Shop at No. 340 Fuxing East Road; (3) On June 6th, they robbed Guo Luxiao and Ye Chen Jinsu at No. 20 Tianfuli, Wujin Road.

### Texaco Employees Disagree over Kerosene Rationing

Employees of the American-owned Texaco Kerosene Company previously protested the company's cancellation of the monthly ration of three "zong" of kerosene per employee starting in April. After negotiations by the labor union, the company only agreed to issue one can, which caused outrage among the employees. The union reported the matter to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. Now the company has agreed to issue one can for April, two cans for May, and three cans for June. However, the price will be calculated at the market price of 2.88 million yuan per can and must be paid in full at once yesterday, for a total of three cans. The remaining three cans will be temporarily withheld. Compared to the labor union's request that the kerosene price be calculated at the rationed price of 820,000 yuan on April 5th, 1.14 million yuan on May 5th, and 1.64 million yuan on June 5th, the standards of both sides are far apart. Employees believe that they have already made extreme concessions to the company on the quantity, but now the company is deliberately making things difficult by raising the old price. Employees have refused to accept the company's price adjustment, and emotions are extremely agitated.

### Part of the Vehicles in Central District to be Diverted to Suzhou Creek Road

Since the implementation of the one-way traffic control measures in the central district, the section of Beijing East Road from Henan Middle Road to Zhejiang Road has been particularly congested. It is reported that the main reason is the proliferation of vegetable stalls on the south side of Ningbo Road and the fact that the road to the north has not yet been built, leaving vehicles with no place to disperse. The Municipal Public Works Bureau is now planning to divert some of the traffic to Suzhou Creek Road to alleviate the congestion on Beijing East Road.

### Shanghai Yang Sister's Whereabouts Unknown: Two Doctors Move Her Out of Huang's Residence, Three Days of Observation Suggests Intermittent Anorexia

[Report from our newspaper] The mystery of "Shanghai Yang Sister" Zhang Dailin's fasting has finally been revealed under the joint examination of two doctors, Hua Shujun and Li Lin. According to three days of on-site observation, Dr. Li believes that Ms. Zhang seems to have intermittent anorexia. She eats a little fruit every three days, which may be a pathological condition, fundamentally different from the complete fasting of the Chongqing Yang Sister. In addition to the currently unknown motivation based on her life experience, the main reason is likely to be due to the particular weakness of her digestive system. This condition has been discovered multiple times in the Soviet Union before the war, but it is rare in our country. Doctors Hua and Li have collected Ms. Zhang's oral saliva, uterine secretions, and feces, and are culturing them to see what kind of bacteria they contain, in order to confirm whether the aforementioned theory is correct. At the same time, on the 20th, Ms. Zhang expressed her unwillingness to eat bananas again, but peeled and mashed two apples, soaked them in hot boiled water, and ate them. This shows that Ms. Zhang's eating once every three days does not seem to be absolutely regular. It is heard that in order to thoroughly explore the mystery of Ms. Zhang's fasting through scientific methods and with nurses accompanying her day and night, Doctors Hua and Li moved her out of the Huang Linshu residence yesterday, but her destination has been kept secret. As for the future disposition of Ms. Zhang, the relevant parties have not expressed great enthusiasm. According to Huang Linshu, he does not intend to continue supporting her in the future.

### American Ship Carrying Aid Materials Arrives: Shipping Industry Hopes Unloading Will Still Be Done in Shanghai, Hope US Cancels Proposal to Sail into Yangtze River

[Report from our newspaper] It is rumored that our government will grant special permission to American ships carrying aid materials to sail into the Yangtze River to the ports of Nanjing and Hankou. The shipping industry in this city is paying close attention to this matter. Yesterday, according to Secretary-General Li Yunliang of the Transport Vessel Industry, the shipping industry earnestly hopes that the United States will cancel this proposal and unload the aid materials in Shanghai, handing them over to our country's ships for transshipment. State-run and private shipping companies have long decided to give priority to the transportation of American aid materials from coastal ports to the interior in order to cooperate with the use of American aid, ensuring speed and convenience. The cost can also be specially discounted. Judging from the current freight situation on the coast and the Yangtze River, ships sailing from Shanghai on various routes have very little freight. In particular, the cargo volume on ships sailing upstream from the Yangtze River to Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou is less than 30%. The amount of American aid materials for transshipment is estimated to be no more than 50,000 tons, and even if a portion of it is transported into the Yangtze River, the freight tonnage is already oversupplied. There is no difficulty in transshipment at all. Moreover, various obstacles placed in the Yangtze River waterway during the war have not yet been removed, and the navigation marks are incomplete. Even inland river ships with a draft of less than 15 feet have great difficulty navigating and often encounter unexpected events such as grounding and collision, while the loading and unloading in inland ports is extremely slow, with an efficiency of only one-third of that of Shanghai. Foreign ships have a draft of more than 20 feet. If they sail into the Yangtze River, the difficulty in navigation, the delay in loading and unloading, and the huge cost of piloting are not cost-effective. The US may use the high transshipment cost in Shanghai as a reason, but in fact, due to the soaring black market exchange rate, the transshipment cost is not much when converted into foreign exchange, while the Shanghai dockworkers can greatly benefit from it. At a time when more and more refugees from various places are coming to Shanghai and the government is struggling to find ways to provide relief, the United States' aid to our country should try to take into account such social issues related to people's livelihood. Therefore, from the perspectives of shipping, economy, and society, it is advisable to unload American aid materials in Shanghai. Li finally emphasized the shipping industry's determination to continuously maintain inland navigation rights and oppose the opening of inland river ports such as Beijing-Hankou, pointing out that other countries, such as the United Kingdom, are still extremely concerned about shipping privileges in China. Therefore, if the government has to grant temporary permission for American ships to enter the Yangtze River due to aid materials, it should be limited to American ships transporting aid materials. It should not be regarded as opening up inland river ports, and other countries without aid materials coming should not use this as an example. This is what our government must insist on, and the people of the whole country should be vigilant together.

### General Price Levels: With Money Supply Overly Loose Last Week, The Rising Trend is in Full Swing

This round of major price increases began at the end of the first week of this month. At that time, the U.S. reduced foreign aid, and our country's portion was reduced by 63 million yuan, with the utilization period extended to 15 months. When the news came, it stimulated a uniform rise in prices. This rising trend, after the previous week, extended to last weekend, and it seems to be still in full swing.

Last week, the wholesale price index compiled by this publication rose by 27.58%. Among the category indexes, food, textiles, chemicals, and building materials all rose by more than 20%, and fuels rose by more than 30%. The authorities' countermeasures to this round of price increases, in addition to still adopting the old method of tightening the money supply, have not seen any new measures. In fact, in recent months, the money supply has always been in a state of relaxation. Coupled with the continuous southward flow of funds from North China, there has long been a trend of flooding, which various stopgap measures cannot cope with.

Judging from the present, if the government cannot immediately start to stop inflation, not only will the high tide of price increases not be curbed, but it will also sit idly by as the crisis accelerates.

Last week, the money supply was still extremely loose and abundant. The exchange situation of the national banks, except for occasional settlements due to the sale of materials, the amount of deficiency was less than one trillion, while the fixed deposits of national banks with other banks were almost always above two trillion, fluctuating within 30% annual interest.

Speaking of the current inflation, this is the most fundamental cause of the price increases, and it is also the most intractable disease that the government cannot cope with. From the recent financial situation, one is the budget figures that this publication has already discussed in the previous issue, which estimates that the expenditure for the second half of this year will reach approximately 3.6 million trillion yuan. The other is the report of Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu to the Finance and Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan on the 16th of this month, which stated: "As of now, the amount of legal tender issued is 1.35 million trillion yuan, the revenue for May was 15 trillion yuan, and the expenditure was 75 trillion yuan."

After seeing this financial situation, we will naturally understand why prices are rising, why all measures are ultimately ineffective, and why huge expenditures and massive issuance, price increases, and further increases in expenditures have an inseparable cyclical relationship. Therefore, if the authorities' countermeasures to future prices cannot open up new avenues and find solutions from the root, but are still circling in the current situation, then there will never be a miracle.

The only way the government stabilized rising prices last week can be said to still be selling materials, but sellers sell and prices rise, with little effect. It is said that the authorities are also very distressed and intend to review the reasons.

We can point out: (1) The prices at which the government sells materials completely follow the market price and do not have a stable price of their own. For example, on Friday, the price of 20-count yarn distributed by the Yarn and Fabric Control Committee was close to 400 million yuan, 42-count yarn was mostly above 600 million yuan, and 12-pound Shuangdeng fine cloth was 12.7 million yuan. The distribution price of Taiwan Sugar also increased with the adjustment of the Taiwan exchange rate. The combined exchange rate on Monday was 445 yuan, on Tuesday 463 yuan, on Thursday 477 yuan, on Friday 506 yuan, and on the weekend 521 yuan.

(2) Because the government has limited control of materials, the sales policy is hesitant. For example, the Food Regulation Committee's sales of rice sometimes sell and sometimes stop. The control of the food market sometimes forces price-limited sales and sometimes restores the free market. This approach fully demonstrates the government's embarrassment and at the same time gives speculators a great opportunity to show their skills.

In addition, in terms of financial facilities, the Gold Control Bureau has approved the use of bills on the same day and will immediately start a trial operation, stipulating: "(1) Banks and companies should carefully investigate the credit of customers who request the use of deposited bills on the same day. If they believe that it can be used, they should order them to find a real guarantor and sign a 'Bill of Use Guarantee' before they can be allowed to use it.

(2) Banks and companies should copy and report the names, account numbers, addresses, and guarantor names of customers who have signed a contract for use to the Gold Control Bureau for record. If the bank or company believes that the customer's credit is not good or there is instability, it may report to the Gold Control Bureau at any time to stop its use, but once reported, it may not apply to restore its use for the customer.

(3) For customers who abuse blank checks, if three returned checks occur continuously, in addition to reporting to the guild by the bank or company as usual to notify the industry to stop dealing with the account, it should also truthfully report to the Gold Control Bureau and, depending on the circumstances, may report to the court for prosecution and file a public prosecution in accordance with the law. The respective dealing banks and companies shall be responsible for providing evidence." From this point of view, the Gold Control Bureau should just formulate management measures at that time to prevent abuses. Why prohibit the use of bills on the same day, resulting in many storms in the market?

Last week, market prices soared, and the newspapers mostly used the word "soaring" to describe the situation. In terms of the stock market, due to the high prices of external goods, many new prices were created. Yongsha closed at a high price of 4,270 yuan on Friday. In terms of yarn and cloth, 42-count Blue Phoenix broke the 600 million mark on Friday, 21-count Double Horse broke the 400 million mark, and Longtou fine cloth stood at a high price of 12.95 million yuan, all setting new records. Due to various reasons such as rising production prices, scarce arrivals, and the transition between harvests, food prices continued to rise last week. The authorities announced on Tuesday that the food market would resume price limits, stipulating that the door-to-door price of white japonica rice would be 10 million yuan, and the Food Regulation Committee would sell 6,000 piculs of rice every two days. However, as a result, there was no high-quality rice on the market, and the market also had less trading. It was heard that the shouting price outside the upper white japonica market on the weekend had exceeded 12 million yuan.

Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cigarettes also rose sharply. At the weekend, Guben soap was close to 20 million, Meili matches rose to 7.4 million, and 500 large British cigarettes rose to 3.5 million. Other items such as chemicals and building materials also repeatedly set new prices.

The wholesale price index by usage last week is as follows:

The wholesale price index by degree of processing last week is as follows:

The wholesale price index by country of production and sales last week is as follows:

### Currency and Finance

(1) Money Market Interest Rates

Last week, the money market in this city presented a situation of struggle between the flooding of floating funds and tightening. Almost every day of the week, it was rumored that the authorities would sell a large amount of materials to tighten the money supply, or that national banks would have a huge deficiency. This seemed to be a war of nerves, and in a short period of time, this nerve tactic also had some effect. However, over time, the truth of the matter was revealed, and the situation suddenly changed. The morning high and evening low of the market's underground interest rate last week was a corresponding reflection. Because whether it is within or outside the industry, if it is rumored that the money supply will tighten, it will inevitably collect some funds for urgent needs. But if it is later known that the previous thinking was not very correct, then the supply of funds on the market will inevitably be strong, and the underground interest rate will also decrease.

Last week, from Monday to Wednesday, the underground interest rate before noon generally reached 30% annual interest, but in the afternoon, partly because floating funds from other places were transported in one after another, and partly because the authorities were unable to tighten the money supply, it eventually fell back to 27%. As for Thursday and Friday, the underground interest rate generally stood at 27%, and the strength of the floating funds can be imagined.

Objectively speaking, from Monday to Friday, the amount of deficiency in national banks cannot be considered small. Including interbank deposits, the deficiency for five days totaled 429 billion, an increase of more than 120 billion compared to the previous week. Even if interbank fixed deposits of 206 billion are deducted, the actual deficiency of the banks was still more than 220 billion, an increase of almost 200 billion compared to the previous week. However, as we all know, inflation is rampant everywhere, and banknotes are being issued more and more everywhere, whether on the front lines or in the rear. As for selling materials to tighten the money supply, it is mainly concentrated in this city. Naturally, when floating funds from North China, Northeast China, and even the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang arrived in this city last week, how could the limited materials in this city compete? The continued relaxation of the money supply was not unexpected.

As for the fact that after a few days, due to the flooding of floating funds, rampant bidding, high prices, and eager demand, the money supply will temporarily turn to tightness, although it is also an inevitable phenomenon, this cannot be simply regarded as a simple cycle that repeats itself. In fact, it proves that each time the money supply is loose, not only is there a quantitative difference from the previous time, but also in terms of nature, it is more serious than the previous time, and the interval between the loosening and tightening of the money supply also has a tendency to shorten. The seriousness of malignant inflation also lies in this point.

The more severe the inflation, the more urgent the escape of funds. The increase in the amount of deficiency in foreign banks is just one end of the outflow of funds. Last week, from Monday to Friday, foreign banks had a deficiency of 154.99 billion, an increase of more than double compared to the previous week. It is said that most of it was income from selling foreign exchange.

In terms of commercial banks, although everything has repeatedly risen and the search for orders is also eager, the interbank lending has still not been seen to be popular due to the abundant reserves of the banks. Last week, banks after No. 60, the exchange result. A total of 379.95 billion was deficient, an increase of more than 158 billion compared to the previous week. However, due to the abundance of cash chips, the number of banks redeeming cash to offset the deficiency from Monday to Friday was also more than 200 billion. The industry's financial resources are not strained due to the increase in indirect exchanges, also because of this reason.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

Last week, the benchmark rate of foreign exchange market prices did not move, and the price of foreign exchange settlement certificates rose fiercely. The price on Monday was only 545,000, but it had risen to about 1.1 million by Friday, a double increase in five days. The Hong Kong exchange rate also repeatedly saw sharp contractions. From Monday to Wednesday, it was 31%, on Thursday it contracted to 28%, and on Friday it saw further contraction. The price of Hong Kong gold was 328 Hong Kong dollars per tael on Monday, and also contracted to 325 yuan on Thursday. The market price of the Hong Kong dollar was 5.48 yuan on Monday, and also contracted by about 4% on Wednesday and Thursday.

In the Shanghai domestic exchange market, the Guangzhou exchange rate, except for a decrease of 10 yuan to 140 yuan on Thursday, was 150 yuan for the other few days. The Wenzhou exchange rate was 100 yuan at the end of the previous week, raised to 120 yuan on Monday last week, and then raised to 150 yuan on Friday. The intensification of the southward flow of funds can also be seen. The Chongqing exchange rate was flat on Monday and Tuesday, and changed to a discount of 40 yuan from Wednesday, which can be measured that there are also many funds flowing into this city from the Chongqing area. The Hankou exchange rate was 40 yuan on Monday, doubled on Tuesday, reduced to 50 yuan on Wednesday, but then increased again and reached 70 yuan on Friday.

Previously, there was the fact that funds from this city were first remitted to Hankou and then to South China. This time, it is also inevitable. The Tianjin discount rate was the highest on Wednesday and Thursday, each being 150 yuan and 120 yuan, and was also above 100 yuan for the other few days. The northward flow of funds remains the same.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

At the beginning of the week, floating funds from other places continued to arrive in Shanghai, the money supply was still loose, and the prices of external goods were rising one after another. Although the Chinese stock short sellers frequently exerted pressure, they still did not see any effect. Yongsha suddenly soared in the last quarter of an hour, creating a new high price of 3,915 yuan. Other stocks rose uniformly.

When it entered the market on Tuesday, it initially showed a beautiful color. Yongsha once exceeded the 4,000 mark, and small stocks such as Xinguang Jingfu all advanced to high peaks. Suddenly, it was heard that the U.S. House Appropriations Committee had restored the loan case to China to 46 million U.S. dollars, and the buying sentiment turned weak. Yongsha then fell below 3,900 yuan. Other stocks also mostly declined from their peaks.

On Wednesday, the situation changed greatly at the beginning of the opening. Because after continuous gains for ten days, people were worried about being high and wanted to be safe, and they took profits one after another. The selling sentiment gradually increased. Yongsha once fell below the 3,700 mark at the lowest point, but then once again knocked on the 3,800 mark because the money supply was still loose. All stocks fell uniformly.

On Thursday, because external conditions were still soaring, people were encouraged, and the buying sentiment was strong again. Yongsha appeared at a new high price of 4,070 yuan. The amount of transactions was also extremely large.

On Friday, floating funds continued to pour in in large quantities, and the prices of Pu Gao Teng Sheng, Yongsha made 4,270 yuan, and eleven types of stocks such as Meiya Xinhuo rose to the limit.

Because it was approaching the weekend and the authorities were saying that they would suppress the rising trend, most stocks saw a small callback, and Yongsha closed at 4,110 yuan.

In the foreign stock market, this week continued the rising trend of last week, and Qiao Xu continued to soar. At the beginning of the week, the money supply was loose, the Hong Kong exchange rate reported a contraction, and external conditions were flying. Yisha rose to 6.3 million yuan, British Union came out of the 7 million mark, and Jardine Matheson created a new high price of 15 million yuan, flourishing like fire and completely new. It was still strong on Tuesday, and rose uniformly. Yisha made 6.55 million yuan, British Union reached 7.5 million, and Yeguang rose from 1.7 million to 1.8 million yuan.

On Wednesday, the Hong Kong exchange rate reported a flat price, and suddenly it was heard that the authorities' control was tightening, and the bulls came out one after another. The market situation was uniformly tired, and Pasha fell to 6.2 million yuan, British Union fell by 400,000 yuan, Jardine Matheson trended down by 700,000 yuan, and Yeguang fell by 200,000 yuan. On Thursday, the black market soared, and the prices of external goods all rose. The money supply was loose again, and foreign stocks also reappeared at high prices. Yisha rose to 6.73 million yuan. British Union made 7.58 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson knocked on the 17 million mark.

On Friday, due to the chaotic black market and the skyrocketing prices of other goods, the buying sentiment was extremely strong for a while, and Jardine Matheson knocked on the 18 million mark. British Union was 8.3 million yuan. Yisha rose to 7.6 million yuan. On the weekend, due to the soaring prices of gold and banknotes in the underground market, various stocks continued to rise, such as Yisha closing at 7.7 million yuan, up 100,000 yuan from the previous day.

### Industrial and Commercial Dynamics: The Shadow of the Japanese Goods Threat

The restoration of Japan and the rampant flow of Japanese goods have undoubtedly constituted a fatal threat to China's national industry and commerce. The impact has also made other countries in the East feel uneasy. According to the United Press International Manila telegram, the Manila Times wrote sarcastically: "Although Prince Konoe is dead, his spirit still lives in the U.S. Department of State, and his dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is still loudly sounding south of the White House."

The Manila Chronicle called on China, India, Burma, Siam, and the East Indies to contact the Philippines and unanimously refuse to trade with Japan. However, on the Chinese side, the attitude of the official or semi-official is not clear. According to the Central News Agency Tokyo telegram, Sino-Japanese private trade has finally started. Since the end of last month, Chinese merchants in Tokyo have begun to negotiate with Japanese merchants, and the transactions discussed have reached about 20. At the same time, the China Trust Bureau, regardless of the opposition of the wool textile industry in the Second District, continued to auction Japanese wool fabrics. Up to the previous week, it had reached three times before and after. Although the wool textile industry repeatedly asked the bureau to stop selling Japanese goods, it has not been effective.

In addition to adopting the proper trade route, the intrusion of Japanese goods also utilizes various smuggling methods. According to the East China News Agency, Japanese goods have been used to smuggle into China by ships carrying compensation materials. As for the targets of the rampant flow of Japanese goods, in addition to mainland China and the South Seas, Hong Kong is a good location. Although the "dumping" of Japanese goods in Hong Kong has aroused fierce opposition and protests from Chinese business groups in Hong Kong, according to the United Press International Hong Kong telegram on the 13th, the Hong Kong side does not intend to restrict trade with Japan, the reason is that Hong Kong's industry is not competitive enough in the free market. It is reported that there are currently about 50 kinds of goods imported from Japan to Hong Kong, mainly raw silk, rayon, piece goods, knitted fabrics, and wool yarn, wool fabrics, porcelain, etc. In the first five months of this year, Japanese goods arriving in Hong Kong reached as high as 35 million Hong Kong dollars.

In order to promote the export of textiles and obtain foreign exchange, the Textile Export Committee recently drafted a yarn and cloth export plan for this year. The planned export volume of yarn and cloth accounts for 20% of the national output, equivalent to 300,000 pieces of cotton yarn, and plans to sell 40,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 8 million pieces of cotton cloth. It is estimated that it can be sold for 75.875 million U.S. dollars. The target of sales is mainly the South Sea Islands and the Near East Africa, and a part is also promoted in India and South America.

Whether such a plan can be smoothly implemented is quite doubtful. For example, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently cabled the Yarn and Fabric Control Committee and the Textile Export Committee, explaining that in the Philippines, the market for our textiles has repeatedly shrunk due to the large influx of Japanese textiles in recent years. It is said that the main reasons are that the quality of our goods is not as good as Japanese and American goods, and the price is higher than Japanese goods, and the length is not standardized. The size of American cloth is half a yard longer than the original length for each piece, and Japanese goods can also be sufficient, while the size of domestic cloth often lacks half a foot or one foot, so it is not easy to be popular and cannot compete with American and Japanese cloth. Even most of the overseas Chinese businessmen who operate textiles in the area also operate American and Japanese textiles. As mentioned above, the prospect of whether our textiles can be smoothly exported is quite bleak.

The above is just one aspect of the initial impact of Japan's restoration on China's national industry and commerce! As for the impact of other military and political aspects, it may be more serious than this!

### National Movement at Daxia University: Teachers and Students Unanimously Support, Students Petition in Beijing, Final Exam Postponed for Three Days

[Our newspaper] More than 2,000 students at the private Daxia University in this city have established a National Promotion Committee to request that the school be changed to a national university. Yesterday afternoon, they hosted a reporter to report that the goal of this movement is pure, and its meaning is purely to rescue the crisis of dropping out of school. It is said that most of the 2,770 students at the school come from rural areas, and their family situation is not very good. Under the current situation, calculating tuition fees at 4 dan [measurement] of rice per semester, at least one-third of the students will drop out of school. Daxia University has brewed "change to national" movement several times in the past, but without results.

This movement has now received unanimous support from all teachers and students, and the students have immediately dispatched representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Education.

### World Games Basketball Team to Face Strong Opponent Tonight: Battle Against Encas at the Municipal Gymnasium Starting at 8:00 PM

Our basketball team representing the World Games, after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing, has successively fought two matches, defeating Dongxing and Renyu. Tonight at 8:00 PM, they will face the challenge of Encas, a strong Western expatriate team in the city (originally scheduled for 7:30 PM, but changed to 8:00 PM because Encas also needs to attend the Western Youth Softball game), in the third friendly match at the Municipal Gymnasium. Referees will be Zhu Zifang and Chen Baolin. Due to the World Games team's financial difficulties for going abroad, ticket prices have been moderately increased to 20, 40, and 800,000 for reserved seats. Reserved seat tickets will be pre-sold starting at 10:00 AM, and the rest will be sold starting at 4:00 PM. The gymnasium doors will open at 7:00 PM. The maintenance of order at the court will be entrusted to the Siwei Boy Scouts and the police.

In the first match against Dongxing, the World Games team's performance was not very good, barely winning by a small margin of 57 to 42. In the second match against Renyu the night before, they had already returned to normal. Bao Songyuan, Huang Daxie, and others all had excellent performances, and Li Shiqiao's ball steals were particularly remarkable, leaving the fans in attendance in awe. As a result, the World Games team defeated Renyu by a large margin of 70 to 34. Tonight, in the match against Encas, the World Games team, carrying the momentum of two wins in two battles, should not find it difficult to win.

Encas is the strongest team among the Western expatriate basketball teams in the city. In the past, they were formidable opponents. Their strength should not be underestimated. Under the guidance of Kaiji Milov, their coordination is usually tacit. Players such as V Kairoski and Bowei are all brave and good at fighting, and the Black Carbon Que Libotuo is particularly resourceful. However, because the season has passed and they have neglected practice, it will not be easy for them to win against our World Games team, which is a solid and sharp force.

[World Games] Jiang Lianggui (Leader), Song Junfu (Coach), Li Zhenzhong (Captain), Cai Wenhua (Vice-Captain), Bao Songyuan (Secretary), Wu Chengzhang, Cai Zhongqiang, Li Shiqiao, Yu Jin, Huang Tianxi, Yu Ruizhang, Jia Zhijun.

### Science Lives, Superstition Dies

â Liu Xian

The stone figures of officials at the racecourse in this city have been worshipped by ignorant men and women day and night, with incense flourishing. Passersby would stop to watch, eventually causing traffic congestion and affecting the city's appearance. The municipal government solemnly convened a meeting and ordered the removal of the decorations and signs. Those with knowledge praised it. However, some superstitious people, claiming to be Buddhist disciples, filed a lawsuit in court, accusing the authorities of obstructing the people's freedom of religion. Others, wealthy and generous men and women, advocated purchasing land to build a temple for worship. In recent weeks, this absurd matter, which should not have been a problem, has appeared in the local news, becoming a topic of discussion for people after dinner. The absurdity of the matter is unmatched. We, from a scientific perspective, witnessing this phenomenon, cannot help but sigh. To correct the misconceptions, we write to refute it.

Today, science is advancing rapidly, changing with each passing day. Since the end of the war, we have entered the atomic age. World powers are diligently engaged in the exploration of advanced scientific research, hoping to make inventions to restore national strength after the war, improve people's lives, contribute to academics, and benefit humanity. However, the general public in our country does not know what scientific research is, nor are they aware of the era they live in. Their knowledge is poor, and their minds are rigid. They are going backward, regressing to fetishism and animism. What could be more ridiculous? We believe that the poverty and weakness of the country are temporary phenomena that can be changed. However, the ignorance and lack of knowledge of the majority of the people are the most worrying. In today's increasingly fierce global competition, a country must have something to stand on. The strength of a nation depends on academics. While the powers are developing science, striving for excellence, we are drawing lots and consulting oracles, believing in divine power, living in a daze, unknowing. The difference in standards is like heaven and earth. To compete in the modern scientific world with such ignorant people, few will escape natural selection.

Furthermore, Shanghai is a major port in our country. It opened its doors early and has been in constant contact with Western civilization for over a century. Shanghai has always been at the forefront of applying new scientific inventions and enjoying modern life. Moreover, due to the former concessions, Chinese and foreigners lived together, and they were deeply influenced by European and American culture. Yet, it is unbelievable that today, Shanghai citizens are still displaying the strange phenomenon of worshipping stone figures by the roadside. Some say it is laughable, but we say it is painful. This is because our country's science is backward, and education has not yet become widespread, causing the general public, even though they live in Shanghai, a city of five million people with deep Westernization, to only know about material enjoyment and extravagant lifestyles, not understanding the contributions of science. By extension, people who only know about worshipping gods and ghosts and lack scientific common sense are not qualified to live in modern Shanghai. For example, electricity is widely used, but if one does not have sufficient electrical knowledge, it is fortunate if one can use electricity without causing a disaster.

Science and superstition are incompatible. In countries where superstition is prevalent, science will not flourish. Conversely, in countries where science is advanced, superstition will not be tolerated. The deeper the superstition, the more closed the people's minds. The clearer the science, the faster the progress. For thousands of years, our country has lacked science. People do not seek thorough understanding in their actions, developing a habit of relying on hearsay. As a result, rumors spread, and hundreds of superstitions emerged. The worship of stone figures at the racecourse is just one example. The consequences of such practices are endless. We believe that all scientific workers, in addition to striving to develop our country's scientific cause, should also engage in the elimination of superstition at all times and in all places. In the process of scientific development, superstition is a great obstacle, deeply rooted, and unbreakable. If this obstacle is not removed, science will not be able to develop freely, and the modernization of the country cannot be quickly realized. Therefore, imparting scientific knowledge and explaining scientific principles to the general public is an essential task, so that those who were previously superstitious will suddenly realize the truth. Once the people's minds are opened, the atmosphere will change naturally, and superstition will disappear on its own. It is hoped that those responsible for education at all levels, especially those whose mission is to train the public, will pay more attention to the elimination of superstition, which is also an indirect way to promote the development of science. Then, in the near future, our country's scientific cause will flourish, benefit the country and the people, and superstitious events will be permanently eradicated in China. The British scholar Thomas Henry Huxley said, "Science lives, superstition dies." We wish to recite it for the people of the country.

### Fun Facts About Atomic Nuclei

â Wang Deqian

Density of the Atomic Nucleus

Usually, when comparing the physical properties of different compounds or elements, we almost always start by mentioning the density and specific gravity of each compound. For example, let's compare water and sulfuric acid. First, we say that the density of water is one gram per cubic centimeter (i.e., per cc), while the density of sulfuric acid is 1.8 times heavier than water, i.e., one cubic centimeter of sulfuric acid weighs 1.8 grams. Then, we compare their color, taste, oh...

But these comparisons are simply not applicable when it comes to atomic nuclei, because the density of the atomic nucleus of each element is the same, even if there are slight differences, the number is very small. However, one thing to declare here is that the density of an element is absolutely different from the density of the atomic nucleus. The density of the atomic nucleus is almost equal to 14/10^15 grams per cubic centimeter, or written as 1,000,000,000,000,000 grams. This number may not seem like much in today's circle society, but it is already quite considerable in the field of chemistry, because no element or compound has a density that can compare to it. Moreover, if you are willing to calculate it further, it will surprise you even more. If you could get 1 cc of nuclear matter (Stuff Nuclei), it would weigh 100,000,000 tons, a number that is much larger than the total amount of steel produced in the United States in a year!

Flame of the Atomic Nucleus

Some people will definitely find this term novel, because we only know about ordinary fire and flame, but why is there also an atomic nucleus flame? In fact, it is not strange. The so-called atomic nucleus flame is a pronoun for the energy and radiation produced at the moment when an atomic nucleus splits. But why not use other words and insist on using "flame"? There are also considerable reasons for this, because when you want to light an ordinary flame, you must have a supply of fluorine in the atmosphere. Similarly, you also need the help of "neutrons" in the atmosphere to ignite an atomic nucleus flame. When you want to keep the flame going, you must have a large amount of coal. In the atomic nucleus flame, it is the same. When you want to keep the atomic nucleus splitting and constantly producing a chain reaction (Chain Reaction), you must have a "just right size" or "critical size" for uranium-235. Other similarities include the fact that ordinary fire can produce visible light and heat, and atomic nucleus flames also produce radiation, but the power of this radiation is much greater than the light and heat of fire. Because of the above similarities, the term atomic nucleus flame came into being.

However, a term cannot fully represent the essence of a fact or substance. Atomic nucleus flames also have differences from ordinary flames. The most important one is the reason why we now call it the atomic age. Ordinary flames require a large amount of fuel, but the energy released is not much, but the fuel required for an atomic nucleus flame is only a small amount, and the energy released is quite large. The end of this war also used this new type of flame. Furthermore, the ash left over from burning coal is just waste, but "atomic ash" contains countless radioactive isotopes (Rodroisotopes), which are treasures in medicine.

Finally, we hope that atomic flames are only the driving force of industry, and that atomic ash is research material for medicine, and should not be used for other purposes!

### New Scientific Weapons

â Liang

Body Armor

American army ordnance experts are nearing completion of a flexible body armor that will provide walking soldiers with adequate protection, and the death and injury rate will certainly be reduced.

Modern infantry is highly mobile. It is already inappropriate to ask them to carry heavy equipment and other necessary weapons. On the battlefield, these walking soldiers lack adequate protection. Ordnance experts have therefore created body armor that protects the body without hindering mobility. This type of body armor is very suitable for snipers, accompanying engineering personnel, and battlefield photojournalists. Combat engineers especially need this flexible body armor when clearing landmines.

Rocket Engine

The U.S. Navy recently announced that it has created a test rocket engine, named Moby-Cick, which can be said to be the most powerful rocket engine in the world. It can generate 66,000 pounds of thrust in two seconds, which is one-third greater than the forward thrust of the German V2 rocket. The rocket engine's cylinder is 105 inches long, 17 inches in diameter, and weighs 1,500 pounds, half of which is the weight of the solid fuel.

Target-Seeking Radar

The British Navy is now using a state-of-the-art radar device called an Automatic Following Device (A.F. Device). When the radar emits a warning signal that enemy aircraft are approaching, simply turn the knob on the automatic tracker, and the antenna will immediately begin automatically searching the sky for enemy aircraft. Within seconds, it can determine the target of the enemy aircraft. When the device finds the target, it emits a green light, and the antenna automatically follows the movement of the target in the sky, automatically recording the target's path and speed direction. At the same time, this device can be linked to anti-aircraft guns, using electricity to enable the anti-aircraft guns to fire at enemy aircraft, with a very high hit rate. (To be continued)

### Why Do We Eat Less in Hot Weather?

â Tong Gao

What is the amazing mechanism inside the bodies of animals and humans that tells them when they are full and hungry? Scientists have always believed that the sensations of hunger, appetite, and fullness come from the activity of the gastrointestinal tract or from the so-called taste organs. Now, two Yale University scientists have proposed a new idea. Dr. John Brobeck and Dr. C. N. Long of the Yale University School of Medicine believe that the urgent need to eat is actually a need to maintain body temperature. Therefore, when the thermometer goes up, the consumption of food tends to decrease, and the activity of the body also slows down. Conversely, when the thermometer goes down, food intake and activity increase.

Many interesting things that happen to people when the temperature changes can be explained by this theory. For example, a football team becomes drowsy after a hearty meal in the warm October weather. Another example is people losing their appetite in extremely hot weather.

Drs. Brobeck and Long have demonstrated that when animals are in a hot environment, they eat less food but can still raise their body temperature.

They placed rats in rooms with varying temperatures, ranging from 65 to 97 degrees Fahrenheit. As a result, the higher the temperature, the less the rats ate, and at 94 degrees they ate almost nothing. Compared to rats at 72 degrees, the food intake of rats at 94 degrees differed by as much as 400%!

Dr. Brobeck said that this theory can be applied to all cells that can digest food, and human behavior can also fit this general paradigm.

Scientific Anecdote

### Anecdotes of Life

â Liu Suisheng

The weather is warm, and all fruits are abundant. In addition to enjoying melons and plums, my wife prepared plum sauce for me. Her deep affection was unexpected and delightful!

I saw the clear water boiling, the green plums rising and falling, and bubbles forming. My wife then used a copper spoon to skim them off to ensure purity. I said, "Copper should not be used because fruits contain many organic acids, which combine with copper to form copper organic acids, which are highly toxic." My wife said, "A little bit shouldn't matter too much." After skimming the foam several times, she poured out the plum soup and divided it into two cups. I tried one and felt a slight strange taste in addition to the sweet and sour. My wife said, "Resources are scarce, it's a pity to waste them!" and finished one cup. Before long, she had a stomachache and vomited profusely before recovering, causing great distress!

On a hot summer day, I was lying on a high bed by the north window when I suddenly heard a noisy sound, knowing that the water carriers were bringing water. I said, "I don't mind paying a high price, I just want pure river water." The water carrier said, "It is pure river water!" I then verified it on the spot: first, I took the prepared pure river water and dripped silver nitrate solution into it, and the color did not change; then, I took pure well water and injected silver nitrate solution, and a milky white precipitate was produced, quite like soy milk; then I took the water from the water carrier's bucket to test, and I also obtained a soy milk-like substance, but the color was slightly lighter. I said, "You added a lot of well water! What do you have to say?" The water carrier was silent.

Gang'er is weak, so we ordered milk: every morning when it is delivered, the seal is always broken. I have already suspected that it is mixed with somethingâso I asked the milkman, "Why is the seal often broken?" He replied, "The long road is bumpy, how can it not be broken!" I then took out iodine and dripped it into the milk. I saw that wherever the iodine passed, it turned blue. I said, "It's mixed with soy milk!" The milkman said in shame and anger, "Doesn't Mr. know that the price of soy milk is not cheap?" Science reveals the adulteration of food, which can be confirmed.

My wife suffers from anemia, and according to the doctor's instructions, she takes organic acid iron supplements. One day, she poured a little into a cup, and Yin'er mistakenly added tea juice, and he said in surprise and delight, "Mom is going to drink ink!" This is because iron salt reacts with tannic acid in tea to form black iron tannate. Doctors always instruct patients not to drink tea after taking iron supplements, and this provides clear proof.

After class, my wife always prepares tea to wait for me. My wife said to me: "I heard you are specializing in popular science. Do you have anything to say about the floating and sinking of tea leaves?" I pondered for a long time before starting to answer. My wife joked, "Why are you silent, like a girl?" I said, "The floating and sinking of objects is based on specific gravity: an object sinks when its weight is greater than the weight of the same volume of liquid, floats when it is less, and can stop anywhere when they are equal. This is clearly stated in physics. After tea leaves are soaked in water, their specific gravity increases, so they sink; bubbles gradually form on the leaves, increasing their volume, so their specific gravity decreases, and they rise again; when they reach the liquid surface, the bubbles burst, increasing their specific gravity, and they sink again. If you don't believe me, please observe carefully." My wife smiled and said, "It's really interesting to get new scientific knowledge while serving tea!"

Time flies, and ten years have passed in an instant. Past events are like smoke, and emotions are like illusions. So I wrote this down to leave a lasting memory. It was the late spring of March in the thirty-seventh year, and the place was the Shanghai Municipal Xinlu Normal School Science Museum.

### Under High Pressure

â Gang Ren

Although we can use super tools to ascend to high altitudes and delve into the oceans tens of miles deep, we have never gone beyond the stratosphere or penetrated the earth's core. We only let the flowers of life bloom there, in a range with similar physical environments.

In this range, pressure, temperature, or other physical environments are almost the same from a cosmic point of view. Many substances encounter different "circumstances" in places we have never reached.

Therefore, if we want to thoroughly understand everything about matter and the architecture of this world, we must understand all the phenomena and principles of matter in various environments. From this, many knowledge and applied sciences have emerged; and with this knowledge, mankind has created their more dynamic world of life.

Among many physical environments, one is familiar to scientific researchers, but ordinary people generally do not feel that it has anything to do with them: "pressure."

In the past forty years, due to practical trends, we have spent a lot of energy to understand the problem of pressure, which has a great impact on all matter.

Scientists have long used a basic number for pressure to measure extremely high pressures. That is "atmospheric pressure." In the usual sense, it means that there is a pressure of fourteen, seven pounds per square inch, which is the force from the weight of the air.

Therefore, the pressure on the deep seabed is naturally different. Obviously, in addition to the atmospheric load, it also carries a long column of water; the pressure on the bottom of a six-mile-deep sea, when calculated, is equivalent to a pressure of one thousand atmospheres per square inch.

There is also a high pressure that can occur when gas expands in a constant-volume container. In cannons, the pressure generated by the gas expansion of explosives is often above two or three thousand atmospheres.

In the center of the Earth where we live, everyone knows that there is high-temperature magma, and only knows that volcanic eruptions are a spectacle, but does not understand that they are a manifestation of high pressure. Inside the Earth's core, surrounded by a quiet skin, exists an environment of 3.5 million atmospheres of pressure.

Humans cannot control such high pressures. The pressure that can be obtained in today's laboratories is only slightly more than one-tenth of that, equivalent to about 400,000 atmospheres per square inch. It is really a "small sorcerer compared to a great one."

However, nearly one-third of the matter on Earth is under pressure within this range, so it is enough for us to apply to the condition of matter under high pressure, and it cannot be considered small.

In fact, not to mention the high pressure of 400,000 atmospheres, which is very difficult to obtain and study in our laboratory, even in an environment of only 100,000 atmospheres of pressure (equivalent to 450 tons per square inch), many important and surprising facts can be discovered.

You may wonder how to obtain such a large pressure! Scientists have used simple principles, precision machinery, and clever methods to achieve their goals. Initially, the principle of using a hydraulic press, relying on fluid transfer to obtain high pressure, the difficulty was the inevitable leakage. Because high pressure cannot occur in a device that cannot be sealed tightly, but a solution was soon found.

The fluid container made at that time used excellent packing materials to reduce leakage to a minimum; and due to the creation of extremely high pressure, fluid leakage was automatically reduced, which is the self-tightening of the packing under high pressure. The higher the pressure, the less likely the leakage.

At this time, the factor affecting the acquisition of high pressure is no longer the leakage problem, but the material strength of the container (Strength) is determined.

Although we have alloys that are stronger than steel and can withstand high pressure, such as carbon-tungsten alloys, etc., under pressure, the strength is more than twice that of steel. But it is still not enough for such huge pressure requirements.

When scientists found that the material was not strong enough, they designed another method, which is the "sleeve method" that is mutually adjusted. This is the same principle as making cannon barrels with several steel pipes sleeved together. They added a lower high-pressure container sleeve to the outside of a high-pressure container. This can obtain the effect of gradually decreasing pressure and making the pressure difference smaller. And the strength of the material does not have to withstand the highest pressure.

### Telecommunications Q&A

[Mr. Fang Chaoshun from Ningbo Road asks] Why are express telegrams sometimes rejected?

(Answer) The locations to which this bureau sends express telegrams are not universal throughout the country. Because the time limit is short (only two hours from sending to reaching the destination), if there is any slight obstruction in the line or the express telegrams are crowded, the acceptance will be stopped to maintain transmission efficiency. The letter did not indicate the date and location of the telegram, so it is impossible to verify. If there is no line obstruction, this bureau will never refuse express telegrams every day.

[Mr. Li Ningchao from Liyang Road asks] I often borrow the public telephone at No. 26, No. 969 Liyang Road. Each time, the charge is 30,000 yuan. After learning that your bureau stipulates only 20,000 yuan, the contractor obviously overcharges. I would like to ask you to investigate thoroughly.

(Answer) This bureau has sent a letter to the management to warn them not to repeat the same incident. If there is any violation, the machine will be dismantled. I also hope to assist in reporting.

Free Talk

### Why Not Eat Meat Porridge?

â Sun He

To be honest: if politics is not thoroughly clarified and bureaucracy is not thoroughly eliminated, then any piecemeal measures that hope to eliminate corruption, talk about administrative efficiency, if not deceiving people, are deceiving oneself.

Laying off redundant employees is not objectionable in principle, but to consider laying off employees as a clarification of official governance is something that even the person who says this knows is nonsense.

Someone once asked starving people why they didn't eat meat porridge, which only illustrates that this emperor was too far away from the people, not knowing how high the sky is and how thick the earth is. People who make this kind of argument today,

Don't they also know that people who work as civil servants today are probably in a semi-starved state, and would have left long ago if they had a way?ââIs it really "the well-fed do not know the hunger of the starving"?

Apart from being an official, there are probably only two ways: industry and commerce. Industry is not for everyone, especially in a recession. As for doing business, not everyone can do business, let alone we are suffering from too many people doing business? Are the market men all over the world? Do we really want North China to become a "Chinese Commercial Country"?

Everyone can talk officialdom, but talking officialdom to people who are worried about being poor is not only teasing but also close to adding insult to injury?

### The Predecessor of Sherlock Holmes

â Mao Yi

Conan Doyle's detective Sherlock Holmes is not purely a fictional character. Doyle was inspired by his professor Dr. Joseph Bell to create his immortal "genius detective." It can also be said that Sherlock Holmes is a portrait of Dr. Bell.

Dr. Bell was a distinguished surgeon who taught at the University of Edinburgh. Conan Doyle, novelist Stevenson, and James Barry were all his students. Holmes's reasoning and analytical rules are nothing more than reflections of Bell's actual life experiences. Bell said: Most people only see and do not observe. Looking at a person, you can find his nationality written on his face, his profession written on his hands, and the rest of his resume written on his walking posture, habits, watch chain ornaments, and the fibers attached to his clothes.

Once, Bell was teaching a class when a patient came. Bell speculated to the students that the visitor was a soldier in the Scottish Highland Regiment and may have been in the band. His reasoning was as follows: the visitor's high-spirited gait suggested that he was a Highland piper; and he was short in stature, so if he had served in the army, he might have been in the band.

But the visitor insisted that he was a shoemaker and had never served in the army. So Bell asked him to take off his shirt and found a small blue "D" branded on his skin. This was the mark branded on deserters in the army during the Crimean War. The visitor finally admitted that he had served in the band of the Highland Regiment.

One afternoon, Bell was sitting in the "Royal Hospital" when someone knocked on the door. "Come in," he said. A person came in. Bell stared at him for a while. "Why are you worried?" he said to the visitor.

"How do you know I'm worried?"

"Because you knocked on the door four times. People who are not worried are satisfied with knocking twice, or at most three times."

That person was indeed worried.

Bell wanted to prove to his students every day that observation is a science, not magic. In the "Royal Hospital," Bell glanced at a newcomer and then said, "I think he is a shoemaker." Later, he explained to the students, "The insides of the knees of that person's pants are worn out, which is a characteristic of a shoemaker. They use that part to clamp the shoemaker's anvil."

However, Dr. Bell was not infallible. Once, he asked a bedridden patient, "Are you a musician?" The patient replied, "Yes."

"You see, gentlemen," Bell turned to his students and said conceitedly, "This is very simple. This person suffers from cheek muscle paralysis, which is the result of excessive playing of musical instruments. We can confirm it by asking." He turned to the patient again and asked, "What kind of instrument do you play?"

The patient propped himself up with his elbow and said, "The big bass drum, doctor!

### Song Renying's British Book Helps Scholarship

Professor Song Renying of Daxia University is excellent in poetry and prose, and his calligraphy and painting are also wonderful. His character is also praised by those who know him well. He is now specifically holding a charity exhibition of calligraphy and painting at the Wuxi Fellow Association from the 19th of this month to raise funds for the Zengguang Yixiao and other expenses. The author has already feasted his eyes on the fine works displayed in the meeting yesterday, and felt that they were of noble temperament and profound accomplishments. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will take the time to visit, and if they are willing to buy a few paintings to give to relatives and friends, hang them on the plain walls and appreciate them from time to time, it will really be a way to please the mood and cultivate the character.

### Duan Qirui's Chess Addiction

â Fu Lu

Duan Qirui served as an official in the Qing Dynasty for a long time. After entering the Republic of China, he intermittently held power for more than ten years. He also once dominated the situation and occupied an important page in modern history. His merits and demerits will be determined in the future. However, apart from Go, he had no other hobbies, which is probably known to everyone. As far as I know, picking up one or two things is enough for conversation.

Before the Xinhai Revolution, Duan was transferred to the Jiangbei Admiral and stationed in Qingjiangpu. His son Junliang (named Hongye) also accompanied him to the official residence. He had a fatherly style of love for Go, and his skills were slightly between two or three moves. Living deep in the office, he suffered from a lack of opponents. He inquired and learned that there was Tianbaolou Teahouse in Pudi, where Go players gathered. From Chen to You, the sound of pieces falling was endless. So he went to drink tea and watch from the sidelines. However, the Zhejiang people only heard that Wen Manqing was good, and the rest were mostly mediocre. After reading it, he unknowingly improved his skills. He heard that the game was very rich in betting. He heard that he was unknown, but he was quite contemptuous of him. When he made a move, it was extraordinary, and he realized that he was a strong enemy. At the end of the game, he lost two sons. Before leaving, Junliang firmly made an appointment to go to his residence tomorrow to have a contest. When the time came, he sent someone to invite him. When he arrived, it was the Admiral's Mansion, which was shocking. He showed his name and sat down to play chess, and both sides did their best. Halfway through, an old man arrived, wearing a lake crepe cotton robe, with a short gray beard, and his mouth slightly crooked. Junliang stood up respectfully, and Wen also followed. The old man ordered to continue playing chess, and put his hands behind his back to watch from the wall. Wen did not dare to ask. After the old man left, Wen asked Junliang and said, This is my father. Since then, he often visited and played chess with each other. Duan's skills were slightly inferior to his son's. Sometimes he won over his father, and he would not be lenient for every piece. Duan's anger was visible in his face. After being defeated, he said: You can't do anything, you can only play chess!

At the same time, there was Wang Yanbai, who was also from Zhejiang. His family was good at calligraphy. He lived in the Admiral's staff and was in charge of making memorials. He was also good at Go. He served Duan in playing chess every day and got along very well. After the Restoration, Duan served as Prime Minister of the Cabinet and sent a letter to invite him to live in his residence. He was nominally a junior official and received a monthly salary. He accompanied him in one or two games every day and had nothing else to do. One day, while they were playing chess, a petitioner came. Duan then summoned him to the side, and the game did not stop. When he was about to leave, Duan stood up to introduce him and said: This is Mr. Wang, my old friend. If you need anything, he is not a crane that does not dance. The guest said yes, and hurriedly went to Wang Zhouxuan to make an appointment to go to his residence the next day. When the time came, he realized that he was the newly appointed Salt Transport Envoy of the Three Eastern Provinces, who had come to Duan for instructions. The next day, he went to Fengtian with Wang as the Bureau Chief. He served for many years and gained a lot. He retreated bravely and returned to Yanjing as a rentier.

### Children's Country

â Guo Ping

In Yugoslavia, six miles from Belgrade, there is a children's republic. With a population of 5,000, they live in wooden houses on the hillside, ranging in age from six to fourteen. They run their own guards, post office, and railways.

Their railway is only six miles long and connects to the Belgrade railway. The children are very satisfied with this small-scale railway.

Part of the wood on the mountain has been felled for building houses. The children built roads around their own houses and planted many trees and flowers. Every child in this small republic has a job to do. When they hear the whistle, they quickly gather in the field, put on a uniform, and start working.

These children are well organized and elect their leaders, form a parliament, and elect members. They manage this small country themselves, with only a very small number of adults to carry out education, supervision, and assistance work.

They have an art exhibition room, displaying the photos of the children who have won excellent awards and competition champions. Of course, they also have various entertainment and leisure activities, so that they can also enjoy a considerable spiritual life.

This experiment of educating children on actual public life has attracted the attention of the entire Yugoslavia, and many Yugoslav elementary school students have visited this small republic.

This group of children is innocent and intelligent, and they live happily together, enjoying education and enjoying the fun of working.

### "Mending to Make it Pure"

â Ma Bin

Occasional Fan Inscription: Intending to request someone to inscribe, leafing through collected works, selected from "Drinking Wine" number twenty:

"Xi and Nong have left us long ago, few in the world return to genuineness; the diligent old man of Lu, mends and makes it pure. The phoenix and unicorn may not arrive, rites and music are temporarily renewed; the sound of the Zhu and Si rivers is cut short, drifting until the violent Qin; what crime do poetry and books commit, becoming ashes in a single morning. These old gentlemen, are sincerely diligent in their endeavors; how can the world below cut them off, with none of the Six Classics familiar. All day long they drive their carts: not seeing the ford they seek. If we do not drink happily again, we will have lived in vain; but I hate many mistakes, you should forgive the drunkard."

Although the artistic conception of this poem is not worth mentioning, I deeply love its meaning; Yuanming, at the time when the Jin dynasty was about to move, resigned from his official position and retreated into seclusion, observing the meaning of his poems, he often compared himself to Jie Ni; in the twenty poems of "Drinking Wine," this meaning is even clearer, "All day long they drive their carts, not seeing the ford they seek," should be thinking of Confucius and regretting not being able to see him again; Yuanming's nature is indifferent, except for being similar to the Confucianism of Yanzi, he initially disagreed with the various schools of Confucius, but he had a deep understanding of the Confucian ideological system, for two thousand years, many scholars have spoken about Confucianism, but in the end, none has been as refined and clear as Yuanming's "The diligent old man of Lu, mends and makes it pure." "Mending to make it pure" is also the meaning of the "Doctrine of the Mean," but it can express the spirit of Confucianism more than the two words "Doctrine of the Mean." Moreover, the writing is elegant and beautiful, without the meaning of vulgar sermonizing; the corrupt scholars of the Song and Ming dynasties, talked grandly about the Doctrine of the Mean, making these two words even more unbearable, now that we have Yuanming's sentence, it is extremely gratifying.

"But I hate many mistakes, you should forgive the drunkard," Su Shi once praised these two sentences highly; I once said that Yuanming's claim of being drunk was actually just a slight buzz, "you should forgive the drunkard" is not something a drunkard can say, and there are endless secrets; in a world of war and chaos, it was not easy to seek to preserve one's head and finish, Ruan Ji feigned madness, Liu Ling indulged in alcohol, in fact, they did not willingly ruin their bodies, but wanted to cover up their true colors, it was unavoidable. Yuanming's situation was exactly like this, but he did it more naturally, so later generations mistakenly thought that Tao was born with indifference!

Yuanming was originally from a noble family, and he also ran around when he was young, when composing "Feeling of Not Encountering Talents," how could he not want to be a diligent old man of Lu? Seeing that "mending" was extremely difficult, he retreated to take care of himself, which is also human nature. Although madness and donations are different paths, they actually lead to the same goal, those who take care of themselves in a chaotic world, in terms of the entire human race, their contribution will definitely not be less than those who actively advance.

Reading Tao's collected works at this time, I feel even more the difficulty of being a person in a chaotic world, even with Yuanming's uninhibitedness and non-action, he still had to say, "you should forgive the drunkard," the rest of us can imagine, but we can only write Tao's poems on fan surfaces!

### 

General Song Mingxuan (Zheyuan) stationed in Ping with the various righteous forces of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee before the "July 7th" Incident, at that time, the enemy's flames were already unapproachable, the General sought to preserve the overall situation, and supported it for more than a year, which was also very difficult. When the War of Resistance broke out, his subordinates, Generals Zhao Tong and Zhang, successively died for their country, Song also fought in the valleys, exhausted from overwork, and died of illness in Sichuan, buried his bones in the green mountains, and his integrity was flawless. And the insults and oppression imposed by the enemy during his tenure in "Hebei-Chahar" were beyond what ordinary people could bear. Such as the Fengtai Incident, such as the Qihua Gate Incident, were all due to the rampant behavior of the Japanese army, forcing Song's troops to retreat and submit. What was even more shocking was that a large team of tanks paraded in the city, and in Tong Square, they conducted offensive and defensive exercises, making Song's troops and police stare at each other, at a loss. Song had no choice but to entertain them, inviting Itagaki and other generals to a banquet, and ordering the Broadsword Team to dance with knives at the banquet, to entertain these "honored guests," because he had no power to resist, and it was inconvenient to remain silent, so he temporarily "prepared leisurely," expressing an attitude of "not caring at all," this was also a no-win situation, it can be said that he had done his best in "enduring," seeing that the situation was difficult, it was considered "bearing humiliation and burden," but in terms of personality, it was no different from "wiping one's face to dry." As the saying goes, "If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated!" But it did not start with Song, before the organization of the "Hebei-Chahar" Political Committee, unreasonable insults had been more than one instance, inciting local ruffians in Xianghe to govern themselves, employing hooligans and plainclothes in Tianjin to cause disturbances, acting sneakily, and still claiming to be a civilized and powerful country, and the leader of East Asia, it was truly shameless. I also remember that in the 24th year of the Republic, a Mr. Bai (an old member of the Tongmenghui, who ran a newspaper in the concession) was beaten to death in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, the Japanese chief suddenly found the Hebei authorities, flew into a rage, and made a large number of threats. In fact, since the case occurred in the Japanese concession, what were the Japanese troops and police in the concession doing? Instead of naturally handling it, they extorted the Chinese authorities, and later expanded the negotiations and forcibly put forward six articles, asking the provincial authorities, General Yu, and the central personnel in Pingjin to "take a step," pressing layer by layer, and oppressing them at will. Song Zheyuan's "Hebei-Chahar" was basically taking the stage by enduring anger. However, in the spring of the 26th year of the Republic, because the demand for "clarification" was endless (that is, completely separating from the central government according to the "East Hebei" puppet government), he really couldn't bear it anymore, so he fled back to his native place, Leling, and soon the "Lugou Bridge Incident" occurred. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's "humiliation" of China was all-encompassing.

After "July 7th," Pingjin was the first to fall, and it did become "clear" like "East Hebei." For the sake of international appearance and pleasing the citizens, they suddenly did some perfunctory things, and the appearance was much quieter. But the youth engaged in underground work and anti-Japanese activities were arrested by them, and they did their best to humiliate them, the world only knows that those detained in their teams suffered torture and were poured cold water, etc., but according to those who had been to "hell," "abuse" was still tolerable, but "humiliation" was really unbearable. For example, Wu Jixu and his wife, from the first class of the Journalism Department of Peking University, were highly talented students of the same class as Tian Pengyou and Luan, after graduation, they served in the newspapers and had a great reputation. When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, he was the editor of the Tianjin Yishi Daily, after the chief writer Sheng Baotang died for his country, the newspaper also stopped publishing, and Qiu Chen and his wife hid in the British Concession, secretly organizing anti-Japanese propaganda for two years, and had long been listed on the "blacklist" by the enemy and puppets. In the summer of the 28th year of the Republic, the Japanese enemy blockaded the British Concession, and its arrogance reached the black people, the British side negotiated with Tokyo, and softened due to the situation at the time. The enemy captured Wu and his wife at night with the British police, Qiu Chen was beaten in addition, and sometimes was invited to sit down and talk, if a word did not agree, then he would be kicked and beaten at will, and the chief was laughing and joking. Zhu Bai, because she was a woman, was not beaten, but was ordered to do hard labor, which was worse than beating. In short, "scholars can be killed but not humiliated," but they insisted on "great humiliation and special humiliation."
