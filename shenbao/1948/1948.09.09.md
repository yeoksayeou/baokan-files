### Truth Revealed in Stock Dumping Case, Xu Baiqi Leaked Secrets, Whether Yuan Yang'an Jointly Profiteered Remains Unclear

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, August 8] After the arrest of Tao Qiming, Xu Baiqi, Yuan Yang'an, and other suspects involved in the Yongsheng Yarn stock dumping case, the Criminal Police Team of the Police Department conducted continuous interrogations. The case has now reached a stage where it is hoped that the three suspects will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court by the Police Department on the afternoon of the 9th. The interrogations conducted by the Criminal Police Team of the Police Department in recent days were conducted individually. According to the confessions of the three suspects, Xu Baiqi has been identified as the one who leaked the news. Xu has formally admitted this on the 8th. Xu was able to obtain the news because he was ordered to draft the telegrams for the bank's two-day closure and the order to suspend trading on the Shanghai and Tianjin stock exchanges. However, Xu only admitted during his confession that he unintentionally leaked the news, which led Tao Qiming to learn of it and go to Shanghai to dump stocks for profit. He insisted that he himself had no intention of profiting from it. During his confession, Tao Qiming pointed out that he had obtained the news from Xu and that the stock dumping was also instructed by Xu. He learned the news on the 18th and immediately flew to Shanghai. On the one hand, he informed his wife, Li Guolan, to dump stocks, and on the other hand, he discussed it with Yuan Yang'an. At the same time, because his plane ticket to Shanghai was purchased through Xu Zhuanghuai, Xu also knew about it, and Xu's wife's stock dumping was also due to her learning of the secret. During his confession, Yuan Yang'an also admitted that Tao had discussed it with him, but denied that he had dumped any stocks. The Police Court dispatched investigators to Shanghai again on the 8th. Zheng Haoming, the chief of the Criminal Police Team, also spoke on the phone with Yu Shuping, the chief of the Shanghai Police Bureau, on the 8th to exchange information about Yuan Yang'an's involvement. After further interrogation on the 9th, it will be possible to determine whether Yuan was jointly involved in profiteering. Regarding the details of Xu Baiqi's leakage of information, Zheng Haoming, the chief of the police team, had two separate conversations with him, telling him that special criminal offenses do not necessarily result in execution and that sentencing depends on the severity of the crime. Xu told the truth on the 8th, saying that after drafting the telegram at noon on the 18th, he went downstairs from the minister's office and met Tao Qiming. He then told Tao about the stock exchange suspension. Tao then asked if it was in preparation for currency reform, but Xu said he could not judge. According to people who participated in the interrogation, based on the confessions, psychology, and polygraph tests, the truth of the case has been revealed as far as Xu Baiqi is concerned.

### Legislative Committee Economic Experts Express Opinions: Capital Increase for Business Banks is Necessary, Pointing out Significant Past Misdeeds of Business Banks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, August 8] Regarding the capital increase for commercial banks, many Legislative Committee members and financial experts unanimously believe that commercial banks during and after the war have not only made no contribution to the country, but have instead taken advantage of the situation to engage in black market activities, hoard goods for speculation, speculate for profit, spread rumors, disrupt the market, and raise prices. The instability of the people's livelihood over the past decade is due to this. They advocate that the government should strictly prohibit the business activities of commercial banks. The capital increase plan this time should be implemented thoroughly, regardless of any difficulties. They also point out several of the most significant misdeeds of commercial banks: (1) The number of commercial banks has gradually increased since the war, but the total amount of capital has not increased with prices. (2) Commercial banks hoard goods for speculation, buy and sell gold and foreign exchange, and engage in speculative arbitrage, engaging in illegal business activities for profit. Their impact on prices is ten times that of inflation. (3) After the currency reform, commercial banks are still engaged in various activities to undermine the currency system. The most significant of these is that all the foreign exchange, gold, and silver held by commercial banks have not been exchanged for gold yuan in accordance with the government's orders with banks designated by the government. On the other hand, as prices gradually stabilize, they cannot profit from price increases, so they engage in massive hoarding. According to news from Shanghai, a large amount of hoarding was discovered during warehouse searches in Shanghai, even those purchased at the beginning of the victory. The owners of these hoarded goods are mostly commercial banks, direct and indirect operators, or those who rely on commercial banks. They take advantage of opportunities and power to obtain large loans from the government and then use them as capital for hoarding. It should also be noted that the capital increase plan for commercial banks stipulates that the total amount of the capital increase should be deposited in the Central Bank within three months after the promulgation of the plan. However, the interpretation of this article should be that after the capital increase of each commercial bank is deposited in the Central Bank, it should be frozen and never be returned after review. If this is not the case, then commercial banks will not be able to borrow capital from each other and collude to cheat. Recently, there have been many rumors that banks in Shanghai and other places have transferred large amounts of money to Guangzhou to purchase black market Hong Kong dollars in order to transfer funds to Hong Kong. The government should pay more attention to this kind of unscrupulous behavior and restrict commercial banks in various places from remitting money to Guangzhou. In this way, their cunning schemes will not be able to survive.

### China Can Negotiate International Bank Loans as Appropriate

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, August 8] News from the Information Bureau: A report stated that China would borrow 600 million US dollars from the International Development Bank for the reform of the currency system in order to support the new currency, and cited European countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia as examples, saying that they had all borrowed funds from the International Development Bank when reforming their currency systems. According to the bank's regulations, loan requests are based on [??] recognition [??]. China had subscribed to 600 million US dollars in shares when joining the bank, etc. According to news from the Ministry of Finance, China has paid its subscribed share款 in accordance with regulations after the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development opened, and it could have submitted a loan application to the bank. However, due to the instability of the domestic economy and the lack of loan conditions, it was unable to make this application. Now that China has implemented currency reform and the economy is expected to stabilize, it can negotiate loans with the bank as appropriate. Furthermore, since the bank opened, it has only handled four loans: 250 million US dollars to France, 195 million US dollars to the Netherlands, 40 million US dollars to Denmark, and 12 million US dollars to Luxembourg, all to assist those countries in developing reconstruction projects.

During the meeting, reports were made on the points that had been agreed upon in past negotiations regarding the US aid special account. After discussion, they were all accepted by the joint meeting. The main points are as follows: (1) The US Aid Committee and the US Economic Cooperation Administration both believe that the sales revenue of US aid materials in the special account should be frozen as much as possible in order to ensure that the utilization of US aid can cooperate with the Chinese government's measures to stabilize currency value. (2) Both parties agreed that the expenditure in the special account should be reduced as much as possible and that a budget should be prepared for all expected expenditures. (3) Both parties agreed that the national currency expenditures required for the industrial construction supplementary equipment plan should be borne by the recipient of the US aid plan. However, only if the US Aid Committee and the US Economic Cooperation Administration determine that the recipient is indeed unable to bear it can funds be allocated from the special account for assistance. (4) Both parties agreed that the expenditure款 in the special account should only be allocated when the various projects (rural reconstruction, industrial construction and supplementary equipment, and the unfinished relief projects of the Executive Yuan's China Relief Organization) actually need funds to be paid to the contracting parties. (5) Both parties agreed that when reviewing the expected expenditures in the budget, strict consideration should be given to whether there is any inflationary nature. In addition, reports were made on the fertilizer distribution principles and the resolutions of the Cotton Group Committee, which were also discussed and accepted by the joint meeting.

### Gasoline Prices for Private Users to be Revised Today, Public Utilities Purchase Oil at Old Prices with Certificates

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, August 8] Most of China's gasoline is imported from abroad, and the amount of foreign exchange consumed is considerable. It is urgent to effectively limit the amount of gasoline used in order to meet the purpose of conservation. In addition to the government's gradual increase in import tariffs, it is learned that the government authorities have approved the sales price and supply methods of US aid oil that has begun to be transported to China, as follows: (1) Public transportation utilities will still be supplied at the old prices as of August 19. However, this public transportation utility is limited to those that have been approved to operate and have fixed ticket prices by the central and provincial and municipal authorities. Those who meet the above regulations will be issued certificates by the Oil Allocation Committee of the Import and Export Management Committee, and they will be allowed to purchase oil at the old prices. (2) Other gasoline users will have their gasoline prices revised from September 9 based on the actual import cost and tariffs. In order to comply with the government's laws and regulations on suppressing prices, the oil companies will not include their due profits. The old prices will be maintained for other oil products such as kerosene, diesel, and fuel oil. It is expected that the number of gasoline used by private persons will be reduced after the above regulations are implemented. At the same time, public transportation utilities will still be able to purchase oil at the old prices, which will not affect other general prices. (Please refer to the fourth edition for gasoline price increases in Shanghai.)

Editorial

### The Premise for the Resumption of Negotiations Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union

Former U.S. Secretary of State James Byrnes delivered a speech in Seattle on the 6th, urging Western allies to reopen negotiations with the Soviet Union to discuss the German question, in order to reach a unified agreement on a peace treaty with Germany. On the one hand, he defended the Yalta Agreement, and on the other hand, he advised the American people not to assume that compromise between the U.S. and the Soviet Union would be a surrender by the U.S. to the Soviet Union. Byrnes believed that the Soviet people definitely did not want war, so he said, "Even if the Soviet Union has the possibility of further aggression, we cannot therefore abandon all hope of peaceful negotiation." Byrnes' speech was full of zeal for seeking world peace, and all those who long for peace agree with it in principle. However, whether the opinions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union can be unified through the path of peaceful negotiation is a serious question. Therefore, after hearing Byrnes' speech, it is indeed necessary to comprehensively analyze the relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Anyone who studies international issues believes that the international issues after World War II have undergone fundamental changes. The "German question" that people generally refer to now is almost completely different from the "German question" of two years ago. In the past, the opinions of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union were generally the same on how to disarm Germany, how to eliminate Nazi ideology from the German people, and how to control Germany so that it would also become a peaceful and democratic country and no longer threaten the peace and security of Europe. But now Germany has become an object of contention between the East and the West, and everyone wants to win the favor of the German people, attempting to use the German people as a tool to oppose the other side. Since the establishment of the West German agreement, the Western allies of Britain, the United States, and France have been working hard on three things: first, the merger of the three countries' occupation zones; second, the implementation of currency reform in West Germany; and third, supporting the Germans in convening a constitutional assembly to form a new democratic government. The intention is to prevent the intrusion of Soviet forces into Western Europe. Seeing the planned actions of the Western allies in West Germany, the Soviet Union felt like a thorn in its side. Therefore, it also incited anti-American sentiment among the German people in East Germany, and also stirred up waves in Berlin in an attempt to offset the impact of the Western allies' actions in West Germany, making the world worry that the Berlin crisis would constitute the starting point of World War III. For two months, under this situation of mutual stimulation and turbulence, the world has been holding its breath, hoping for the elimination of the Berlin crisis.

Although the Moscow negotiations have exhausted all possible detours and twists, after a month of talks, a turning point has finally been achieved. If both the East and the West have the sincerity to compromise, then there is great hope for transforming hostility into harmony in the international arena. Therefore, the world's attention has shifted from Moscow to Berlin, especially the meeting of the commanders of the four powers' occupation zones, which not only discussed the unification of the Berlin currency system, but also touched on how to lift the Soviet Union's blockade. People especially felt that the international gloom had a hope of being swept away. However, at the time when the atmosphere of the four-power commanders' negotiations was at its most harmonious, the German Communist Party suddenly engaged in demonstrations, marches, and riots. They shouted anti-American slogans, invaded the Berlin City Hall, and attempted to overthrow the democratically elected Berlin City Government by force. As a result, the problem arose again. On the surface, the actions of the German Communist Party seem to be indistinguishable from the attitude of the Soviet Union, but in reality, the instigation of the German Communist Party is definitely not simple. This newspaper's editorial on the 3rd pointed out that the actions of the German Communist Party in Berlin will be an important factor in determining the success or failure of the four-power negotiations. In less than a few days, the German Communist Party, as expected, destroyed the Berlin City Council and attempted to form a Communist Party city government. Seeing the Soviet police's indulgence and failure to stop the German Communist Party's atrocities, the intentions of the Soviet Union are already well known.

The deterioration of the Berlin crisis, no matter from which angle it is observed, cannot be ignored. The Berlin negotiations have already stalled, and the Western three powers will also lodge a protest with Soviet General Kotikov. Future developments are even more unpredictable. British officials' expression of shock at the deterioration of the Berlin crisis is by no means deliberately creating panic and arousing public anxiety, because the significance of the Berlin turmoil is indeed too serious. Therefore, we believe that if the four-power negotiations or the U.S.-Soviet negotiations are not resumed, so be it. If they are to be reopened, then the most important premise is the sincerity of both sides. As the saying goes, "Sincerity can move mountains," otherwise, if negotiations are conducted on the one hand and unexpected incidents occur on the other, no matter how hard diplomats try to mediate, it will always be in vain.

### Sun Lianzhong Issues Statement Regarding Gathering and Causing Trouble by Refugee Students, Hoping Students Will Abide by the Law, Those Who Deliberately Violate It Will Be Severely Punished According to Law

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 8th] Garrison Commander of the Capital, Sun Lianzhong, issued a statement regarding refugee students coming to Nanjing and gathering to cause trouble, stating: Since the Communist bandits expanded their rebellion, students in the bandit areas, with the will to love the country and support the government, were unwilling to be coerced by the bandits. Experiencing dangers and obstacles, they have successively fled south and come to Nanjing via roundabout routes. Their determination and the hardships they have encountered are deeply sympathized with, and the government is especially concerned. Most of the students who have come to Nanjing cherish themselves, respect themselves, and abide by the law, but there are still a few students who make excessive demands and take actions that go beyond the bounds. There have even been incidents of gathering to cause trouble, such as beating public bus ticket sellers and forcibly entering various theaters without tickets. A few days ago, there was another act of gathering to destroy the National Grand Theater, causing various theaters to feel threatened and dare not operate. Although the above disputes occasionally arise due to improper words and actions of transportation and theater staff, the aftermath is that students gather to cause trouble, beat people, and destroy property, resulting in actions and consequences that are contrary to the cause. Such illegal and unreasonable actions are particularly disruptive to social order. This command is responsible for the security of the capital. It earnestly hopes that students coming to Nanjing will appreciate the difficulties of the times, exercise reason, abide by the law, and strictly observe order. They must not abandon themselves and act rashly. Any reasonable requests should be immediately reported to their responsible personnel or instructors and made to the relevant authorities, which will do their best to resolve them. In the future, if there are any dealings with industry and commerce, they can directly report to the police station in charge for assistance. When dealing with soldiers, military police can also mediate on the spot or report to this command for handling. It is hoped that there will be no more incidents that violate laws and regulations. If there are any deliberate violations, they will be prosecuted as disrupting social order and severely punished according to law. It is also hoped that people from all walks of life will sympathize with refugee students and provide more assistance to enable them to unite and overcome difficulties together. This is what is earnestly hoped for.

### Garrison Headquarters Convenes Meeting to Discuss Refugee Student Issue

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 8th] The Garrison Headquarters of the Capital issued a public announcement on the 8th regarding the handling of the refugee student issue. It stated briefly: According to statistics from the Capital Police Department, from August 16th to September 8th, there have been as many as 52 incidents of refugee students gathering to cause trouble. As of the afternoon of the 7th, more than 300 students gathered and twice destroyed the National Grand Theater. That evening, they had conflicts with the World New Capital and two other theaters, causing the theaters to be unable to operate normally and greatly affecting social order. The headquarters attaches great importance to this matter and specially convened a meeting on the morning of the 8th with representatives from various security agencies and the Ministry of Education's Education Department, the Henan Provincial Association, and other units. It was decided that, on the one hand, all parties concerned would earnestly persuade and strictly discipline them, and immediately implement the methods formulated by the Ministry of Education to properly resettle them. On the other hand, the Ministry of Education will find ways to solve the students' entertainment problems. At the same time, it will formulate measures to order the police to stop illegal acts of gathering to cause trouble and destroying theaters at any time, or to arrest the ringleaders to maintain urban traffic facilities and entertainment venues.

### All Entertainment Venues in the Capital Suspended Business Yesterday

Resuming Business Today After Petitioning and Receiving Guarantees

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 8th] All entertainment venues in the capital took concerted action on the 8th to suspend business. The main streets and bustling areas of the city, as well as various commercial venues, were crowded with people, presenting an unprecedented scene. Movie theaters, Peking opera theaters, and tea houses in Confucius Temple, which usually accommodate a large number of spectators in the evening, were tightly closed with iron gates, desolate and desolate, and each hung a public notice saying: "This theater (hall) has been destroyed by fellow businesses and is concerned about the safety of customers. It is currently petitioning for protection, so it will be closed for one day today. We hope for your understanding." This situation is purely the result of refugee students from the bandit areas continuously forcing their way into theaters without tickets and gathering to cause trouble. However, after the Capital Film and Drama Industry Association sent representatives to the Garrison Headquarters of the Capital, the City Government, and the Police Department for petitions on the morning of the 8th, it has received assurances that it will resume business on the 9th under the strengthened guarantees and maintenance of the military police.

### School Buildings for Northeastern Temporary Universities and Middle Schools Have Been Resolved

In addition, the complete list of students for the three Temporary Middle Schools has been verified. The First Temporary Middle School has 2,032 students, the Second Temporary Middle School has 1,970 students, and the Third Temporary Middle School has 1,960 students.

### Lei Zhongshu and Hu Wenhui Discuss the July 5th Incident Again on Behalf of Beiping People's Organizations, Expressing Opinions Based on Actual Situation and Legal Perspective

[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch on the 8th] Supervisory Committee member Hu Wenhui issued a statement on the 8th regarding the joint telegram sent by Beiping People's Organizations to the President, the Executive Yuan, and the Control Yuan regarding the July 5th incident, expressing opinions again on the actual situation and legal perspective of the "July 5th" incident. It is stated that: "The 'July 5th' incident indeed occurred after the imposition of martial law. The first paragraph of the report mentioned it and was not overlooked. However, Article 3 of the Martial Law Act stipulates that 'In the event of war or rebellion, when a certain place is still under siege by bandits or when dealing with extraordinary incidents, the highest commander of the naval and air forces in that location may declare temporary martial law in accordance with this law.' Northeastern students gathered at approximately 7:00 AM on July 5th, went to the Beiping City Council for petitions at 8:00 AM, and destroyed its doors, windows, and office equipment. At approximately 12:00 PM, they went to the residence of Deputy Chief Executive Li Yuyu for petitions. At 2:00 PM, they surrounded the residence of Xu Huidong in Dongjiaominxiang. At approximately 5:00 PM, two companies of the search battalion of the 208th Division and four armored vehicles arrived for deployment, and soldiers lay prone and cocked their weapons in a combat stance. It was not until 7:00 PM that Bai Shiwei, the deputy director of the police bureau who was in charge of command on the scene, told the student representatives in the courtyard that martial law had been declared and that everything would be discussed tomorrow, and instructed them to go back quickly. When Bai and other student representatives left the courtyard and instructed the students to disperse, gunshots rang out from the east and west. If we study it from the perspective of martial law, we can only use the term 'extraordinary incident.' Whether the Northeastern students' petition and destruction of the City Council and surrounding Xu's residence due to anger at the resolution of the City Council belongs to an 'extraordinary incident' is quite worthy of study. On that day, besides the Northeastern students' petition in Beiping, there were no other incidents that affected or harmed public safety and order, which is evidenced by Commander Fu's order not to allow soldiers to carry guns. Therefore, the imposition of martial law was specifically for the Northeastern students. Moreover, the martial law order was not issued at the beginning of the incident but when the students were about to disperse due to hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Even if we take a step back, the promulgation of a martial law order also has a certain legal procedure and public announcement method. According to Bai Shiwei, the martial law order was notified by the garrison command by telephone, and the students were unaware of it, which means that the martial law order was not widely announced. When students gathered for petitions during martial law, the legal action should have been only to forcibly disperse or detain them. As for the claim that bad elements had infiltrated and incited, the defending troops could have conducted a search and arrest on the student side and punished them separately according to law. However, they indiscriminately opened fire on the large student group, resulting in 28 deaths and injuries. Afterwards, they used various excuses to try to shirk responsibility, which is truly heartbreaking. Supervisory Committee members, in accordance with the powers conferred by the constitution, can, with their strict stance, impeach officials who violate the law and neglect their duties, and will never be biased or subservient to any environment. Since this case has been submitted for impeachment, the Executive Yuan should be allowed to handle it within the statutory period. The opinions of the Beiping people's organizations are probably only for the reference of those handling the case."

### Refugee Students Beat Drivers, Beiping Trolleys Suspended Operations Briefly

27 Incidents of Beatings in the Past Three Days

[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 8th] All trolleys in Beiping were suspended this morning, and traffic throughout the city was brought to a standstill, resuming normal operations at 11:00 AM. At 7:20 AM this morning, more than 200 Northeastern refugee students rushed from Beixinqiao towards Dongsi Archway, chasing trolleys and injuring drivers. Upon hearing the news, all ticket sellers and drivers fled to the Trolley Workers' Union in Dongzongbu Hutong, with students chasing after them, causing great chaos. After military police arrived and persuaded them, they dispersed. The trolley company hosted reporters today, reporting on the beatings. From the 6th to the 8th, there have been 27 incidents of beatings. The city's fare revenue is only over 5 billion, and the revenue and expenditure are seriously insufficient. With this blow again, the future of Beiping's transportation is worrying.

[Another dispatch] More than 400 Northeastern students in Beiping, divided into eight trucks, suddenly wanted to occupy the Guangmingdian Police Academy. However, some students at the police academy had not yet graduated. After persuasion from the school and security agencies, they left. The school also agreed to allocate some housing for their use, but only after all the students have graduated.

### Qiantang River's "Osmanthus Tide" Raging, Sweeping Away Thatched Huts and Cars

[This newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch on the 8th] The magnitude of the Qiantang River's Haining Tide, the first phase of the Osmanthus Tide in the eighth lunar month, is unprecedented since the founding of the Republic of China. The tidal bore is as high as a small mountain, and exceeds ten feet at Yuetang. Along the area from Haining to Qilimiao, the strip stones on the fish-scale embankment were washed away by two or three levels. Wang Dongyuan and Chen Beida watched the tide a few days ago, and their car parked on the embankment was swept into the river. The ferocity of the tide can be seen. In the areas of Wengjiabu, Laoyancang, and Shiba Fort, the tidal waters swept away thatched huts outside the embankment and a large number of salt boards, killing and injuring many people. The Embankment Works Bureau has taken emergency rescue measures to avoid direct damage from the tide.

### Suzhou Rickshaw Pullers Strike to Protest Tax Increase

Five Agitators Arrested and Interrogated

[This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch on the 8th] Suzhou rickshaw pullers suddenly went on strike in unison on the morning of the 8th to protest the increase in rickshaw rental fees by rickshaw companies. By 9:30 AM, rickshaws had disappeared. Amidst the chaos, the police station seized five individuals who had no identity in the industry but participated in inciting the strike and arrested them for interrogation. The dispute had not been resolved by 10:00 PM. Travelers to Suzhou from Nanjing and Shanghai felt greatly inconvenienced. Temporarily, some people seized the opportunity to organize porter teams to carry luggage for customers.

[Central News Agency Suzhou dispatch on the 8th] The county government summoned the chairman of the rickshaw pullers' union and ordered them to resume work that evening. At the time of dispatch, there were already a few rickshaws on the street, and it is expected that all will be restored tomorrow morning.

### Mao Jiaqi, Chief Prosecutor of the Hankou High Court, Accused of Corruption, Rumored to Have Accepted Bribes of Nearly 6,000 Taels of Gold

[This newspaper's Hankou dispatch on the 8th] A shocking corruption case recently occurred in the judiciary here. The defendant is Mao Jiaqi, the chief prosecutor of the High Court, and the plaintiff is Gao Qianqing, a jailed traitor. Gao listed in the complaint that "When Mao Jiaqi was handling Gao's case, he secretly sent Mrs. Chen to extort four taels of gold from him. Gao's wife had no choice but to scrape together five taels and two qian of gold and hand it over to Yu Shouzheng of the Lao Fengxiang Gold Shop, who transferred it to Wang Zhichao of the Fuheng Silver Shop, which Mao jointly operated, for counting. Later, Mao became even more greedy and secretly sent Wang Zhichao to extort a building for housing. Because the house had already been sold, it could not be delivered, so Mao retaliated out of spite and framed him. Afterwards, Gao tearfully recounted the incident to the judicial authorities. Fearing that his misconduct would be exposed, Mao also sent Police Chief Li Xueqing to plead for a resolution and personally wrote a card, saying that he had smoothed things over with the Supreme Court and instructed him to wait quietly for a retrial," accusing Mao of corruption and violating the law, with convincing evidence. Just as the court was summoning the case, dozens of other victims' families listed 39 bribery cases of Mao, detailing the case, date, and amount of the bribe, totaling 5,956 taels of gold. For a time, those who heard it were shocked, and public opinion was in an uproar. Mao also published a statement, saying that although a certain Yu had invited Wang Zhichao to deliver a gift on behalf of Gao Yunqing, his wife had refused it and ordered him to return it immediately. Currently, in addition to the trial by the Wuchang Court, the Supervisory Committee's Office in the Hubei and Hunan region is also sending personnel to investigate. Mao has been working in Hubei for three years. Previously, he had been widely criticized for raising donations by taking advantage of his position and collecting gifts under the pretext of marriage and birthdays. Among the cases he is accused of this time, some may not be entirely factual, but several of them were previously thoroughly investigated by the judicial authorities, who believed that Mao's handling of traitor cases was indeed inappropriate and gave him a demerit. His recent transfer to the presidency of the Henan High Court is also related to the accusations from various parties.

### Chen Zhengquan, Bandit Leader of Huaying Mountain in Sichuan, Killed

[This newspaper's Chengdu dispatch on the 7th] Bandits in Huaying Mountain in Sichuan are rampant. The provincial government launched a campaign to encircle and suppress them, and the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters established a Suppression Command to conduct a comprehensive suppression. The bandit leader Chen Zhengquan was recently killed. The bandit forces are expected to be completely eliminated by the end of October. Chen was a graduate of Chongqing University and served as the chairman of the Autonomous Association. He had considerable influence. His death has eliminated a major scourge for the local area.

### The Ping Commercial Daily Suspended Publication Due to False Report of Nie Rongzhen's Defection

### Treasure from Three Thousand Years Ago, Zhou Wenwang Ding, Rediscovered

Still Sent to Chengde Treasure Museum for Storage

[Central News Agency Chengde dispatch on the 8th] The Zhou Wenwang Ding, lost for two years, has now been found by the 15th Army. After being sent to the Provincial Assembly for identification and verification, it was sent back to the Treasure Museum for display. This Ding was moved from the inner court to the Mountain Resort by Qianlong in the 44th year of his reign and is one of the most valuable of the Zhou Dynasty artifacts, commonly known as the ten Zhou Dynasty bronzes, and is a relic of the Zhou Dynasty from three thousand years ago. In order to display this artifact, the Qing court specially built a copper hall in the Mountain Resort. Later, the copper hall was dismantled and moved away by the Japanese, but this artifact was preserved. It was not until the Communist bandits entered Chengde that it was completely lost. Fan Jiong, a county official in Chengde, recovered seven pieces two years ago. Including this one, there are now eight pieces. The remaining two pieces are still missing.

### Yunnan Provincial Assembly Cables the President Again, Stating that Li Deyin Should Be Immediately Executed, Executive Yuan Sends Xu Kan to Thoroughly Investigate the Rong Nickel Coin Case

[This newspaper's Kunming dispatch on the 8th] The Yunnan Provincial Assembly held its 15th resident committee meeting on the 8th. Due to the long delay in the case of Li Deyin, manager of the Kunming Central Bank, for dereliction of duty and embezzlement, it cabled the President again, requesting that Li be executed on the spot as soon as possible to appease public anger and thank the people of the country, listing three major charges: (1) Taking advantage of the opportunity to reform the currency system, leaking information during the bank holiday, colluding with unscrupulous merchants to purchase gold and silver, and secretly sending people to various counties to snatch nickel coins, causing extreme financial chaos and soaring prices; (2) Exercising no control over various commercial banks, with rampant speculative transactions during normal times, and taking advantage of his position to accept bribes during emergencies, colluding with commercial banks; (3) Indulging commercial banks in absorbing funds through high-interest loans, illegally hoarding, and purchasing gold notes, affecting the market. Dozens of assembly members spoke passionately, and public opinion in Kunming was also quite indignant.

[Central News Agency Kunming dispatch on the 8th] Yunnan Chairman Lu Han recently ordered the municipal government to strictly investigate and suppress hoarders and price-gougers and to eliminate them in the short term. The inspection team has been ordered to strengthen its work, and the public is allowed to report tips.

[This newspaper's Chengdu dispatch on the 8th] Regarding the Rong Central Bank's nickel coin embezzlement case, the Executive Yuan replied to the Sichuan Provincial Assembly and others, deciding to send Comptroller General Xu Kan to Sichuan to thoroughly investigate.

### Repeatedly Cracked Down on Underground Banks

Five Arrested and to Be Sent to Fuzhou Special Criminal Court

[This newspaper's Xiamen dispatch on the 8th] Although underground banks in this city have superficially ceased operations recently, they are still secretly trading in black market foreign currency. After receiving reports, the municipal government dispatched a special inspection team for a surprise inspection on the afternoon of the 7th and successfully cracked down on five banks: Jiesheng, Maozhang, Chongji, Yongji, and Yonghua. It seized US$300, HK$170, and a large number of confidential telegrams exchanged between Xiamen and Hong Kong since 1941, as well as black market account books.

### The Schumann Cabinet of France Fails Again, Queuille Ordered to Form Cabinet, Herriot Declines Due to Old Age and Illness

[This newspaper's report] London, 8th, radio Paris: On the 8th at 3 pm, the President of France, Auriol, summoned 76-year-old statesman Herriot to attempt to form a cabinet. Mr. Herriot declined, citing his weak health and multiple ailments. It is reported that Mr. Herriot has suffered from phlebitis for a long time and is nearly deaf.

[This newspaper's report] London, 8th, radio Paris: Auriol summoned Queuille, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party in parliament, on the 8th to attempt to form a cabinet. Mr. Queuille, 64 years old, has held minor cabinet positions 16 times between 1920 and 1940 and served as Minister of Public Works in the short-lived Schumann cabinet. Mr. Queuille replied that he would consult with the leaders of various parties on whether to accept the cabinet formation and would respond by noon on the 9th.

[Associated Press, Paris, 8th] Prime Minister Schumann submitted his resignation last night after a vote of no confidence in the National Assembly. The Schumann government was only two days old. President Auriol is now considering inviting French statesman Herriot to form a cabinet to form a national coalition government to cope with the most serious political crisis since the war. Auriol is determined to prevent a showdown between the Communist Party and the Gaullist faction at any cost, as this would be a death sentence for the current centrist parties in power. Prime Minister Schumann resigned after the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party suddenly changed their minds and voted against him in the National Assembly on the 7th. Whether Herriot is willing to express his loyalty and patriotism to take on this difficult task is questionable. He is 76 years old, suffers from many ailments, and is hard of hearing, often struggling even to perform his duties as Speaker of the Assembly. If Herriot refuses to come forward, Auriol may invite a member of the Radical Socialist Party to form a new cabinet, with former Finance Minister Mayer or former Prime Minister Marie being possible candidates, but the hope is minimal. Communist leaders Thorez and Duclos have repeatedly demanded to form a government.

[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] The French Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party rebelled against Prime Minister Schumann during a vote of confidence in the Schumann cabinet in the National Assembly on the 7th, leading to his resignation. The parliament voted 295 to 285 against the Schumann cabinet, with 30 abstentions, creating France's third political crisis in six weeks. Following the vote, French statesman Herriot resigned from his position as chairman of the Radical Socialist Party. Herriot is also currently the Speaker of the National Assembly, and his actions demonstrate the division within the party. Schumann ignored the advice of his party members and requested a vote of confidence, announcing that he would resign if it failed, thus creating this crisis. Schumann could have indefinitely postponed the debate on the cabinet formation issue, but he accepted the challenge and failed by a margin of ten votes. To resolve the political crisis, the National Assembly may dissolve itself and hold general elections. In the general elections, the centrist parties are likely to fail, thus laying the foundation for a power struggle between the Communist Party and the Gaullist faction.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The collapse of the Schumann government was due to the Radical Socialist Party's last-minute disapproval of the grand plan for economic recovery. It is generally said that former Prime Minister Marie's organization of a mixed government of centrist parties and similar parties, rejecting the two extreme elements of the Communist Party and the Gaullist Party, was more intelligent, but his Finance Minister Reynaud's fiscal and monetary plan failed to gain majority support and thus failed. Reynaud's plan was divided into three parts: currency, cost of living, and salaries. Reynaud's intention was to stabilize the currency first, and the cost of living would naturally tend to stabilize. However, Schumann's Christian Social Party Finance Minister Pinot, under pressure from the labor unions, tried to stabilize wages first, then prices, and finally the currency, which was not approved by the Radical Socialist Party and also failed.

### Communist Disturbances in Berlin, US Determined to Strictly Stop Them, White House Holds Special Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures

[This newspaper's report] Washington, 8th, broadcast: Marshall stated at a press conference today that we must do our best to curb the Communist Party's attempts to create chaos in Berlin.

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] The government is deeply concerned about the deteriorating Berlin crisis. Secretary of State Marshall plans to host reporters at noon on the 8th, but it is questionable whether he will be willing to break the official silence on the breakdown of the four-power talks. It is rumored that the Berlin talks have stalled, but President Truman's decision to convene a special meeting of the National Security Council indicates that Washington is taking the situation very seriously. Some diplomats here believe that if the Soviet Union sincerely wanted to resolve the Berlin issue, it would not have allowed the riots of the past few days to occur. Although there was optimism due to the promising progress of the Moscow talks and the decision of the four powers to try again to resolve the currency and blockade issues, the repeated riots have shattered this optimism. It is speculated that Truman's convening of a special meeting on the 7th was to plan US policy after the failure of negotiations.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, deeply concerned that the tense situation in Berlin, which has reached a near-crisis level, threatens the consultations currently being conducted in Berlin by the four Allied commanders, returned to London tonight. All sectors of the government are now openly criticizing the Soviet Union as the true instigator of the Berlin disturbances.

### Soviet Air Force Exercise Threatens Berlin Airlift

[Associated Press, Berlin, 8th] The Soviet Union conducted another large-scale air force exercise on the 8th, threatening the Berlin airlift. The news of the large-scale Soviet air force exercise was formally notified to the US Air Force Command by the Soviet side in a written statement, stating that the Soviet Union will conduct exercises in the airspace over Berlin and within the three Western air corridors from September 6 to September 15. The exercises in the corridor area will be as low as treetop level and as high as 6,000 feet, while those over Berlin will be between 9,000 and 36,000 feet.

### Fifteen Countries Reach Agreement on West German Tariff Issue

The procedure proposed by the United States will grant West German territory the most-favored-nation status, as agreed upon by the signatory countries of the General Agreement.

[Agence France-Presse, Tirana, 8th] The Albanian Foreign Minister issued a communiqué today stating that three Greek bombers flew over the Albanian border and dropped 12 bombs on the village of Kozovica near the city of Argokastor, killing and wounding many villagers and causing severe damage to property.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 7th] It was officially announced that gendarmes discovered bandits digging underground water pipes in the suburbs of Athens last Sunday night, attempting to sabotage Athens' water supply. If the water pipeline is damaged, the drinking water for Athens' 1.5 million residents will immediately become a problem.

### Pravda Breaks Silence, Viciously Criticizes Southern Leader Tito

[Associated Press, London, 8th] The Soviet newspaper had maintained silence on the Stalin-Tito discord, but this was suddenly broken by Pravda on the 8th. The newspaper accused Marshal Tito of "cruelly persecuting the majority of the Southern people who oppose his regime." The newspaper firmly denied the Southern claim that the Communist Information Bureau is launching a "campaign" against the Southern people and the majority of the Southern Communists, adding that we believe that the Southern people are our loyal allies. It is an undeniable fact that the majority of Southern Communist Party members still adhere to internationalist traditions, not Tito's nationalism. It also stated that Tito has been able to remain in power by implementing "brutal terrorist measures to suppress, collectively arrest, and murder comrades within the party."

### No Agreement Reached on Lifting Berlin Blockade, Four Governors' Meeting Stalls, West Protests Soviet Arrest of German Police

[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] The four Allied military governors in Germany, namely Clay of the United States, Robertson of Britain, Koenig of France, and Sokolovsky of the Soviet Union, began their meeting at 4:04 pm today and ended at 9:55 pm. After the meeting, it was officially hinted that the four governors had failed to reach an agreement on the details of lifting the Berlin blockade. It was also stated that the meeting would not be reconvened, at least until new instructions were received from their respective governments.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 8th] The West delivered a strong protest to the Soviet side this afternoon regarding the Soviet betrayal and arrest of 19 German police officers on the evening of the 7th. The protest was delivered directly to Sokolovsky by French military governor Koenig, and its contents are unknown. The Berlin City Council held a special meeting in the British sector on the evening of the 8th to protest the Soviet detention of German police officers. The Soviet news agency stated that the 22 German police officers arrested at the US Liaison Office on the evening of the 6th "are still under constant interrogation by the Soviet side."

[Associated Press, Berlin, 8th] The battle for the Berlin City Hall has ended, and the Soviet side has arrested another 19 German police officers from the Western sector. These 19 German police officers were originally stationed at the City Hall, and the Soviet side tricked them into leaving under the pretense of granting safe passage. Ten minutes later, as the 19 people were being transported to the French sector in French military trucks under French protection, they were all detained by the Soviet army.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] The tense situation in Berlin has eased after the Soviet side lifted its siege of the City Hall today. The Soviet side had banned anyone from passing through the area for the past four hours. The Soviet Union ordered its 常備軍警衛隊 and German police to withdraw from the vicinity of the City Hall and allowed the Germans inside to leave.

### US, Britain, and France Agree to Soviet Proposal to Convene Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris to Discuss the Issue of Italian Territories

[Central News Agency, London, 8th] The British government has now agreed to the Soviet proposal to convene a foreign ministers' conference to consider the future of the former Italian colonies as stipulated in the Italian peace treaty before September 15. Britain has also suggested Paris as the venue for the conference.

### Soviet Union Detains Japanese Prisoners of War for Military Service, MacArthur Raises Serious Protest, Soviet Representative to the Allied Control Council Takes a Reserved Attitude

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 8th] MacArthur Headquarters has raised a serious protest with the Soviet authorities over the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war in accordance with the stipulated monthly quota. A spokesman for MacArthur Headquarters revealed today that the letter of protest was sent on September 3 to Lieutenant General Terentii Shtykov, the Soviet representative on the Allied Council for Japan. According to reliable information obtained by MacArthur Headquarters, there are still more than 500,000 Japanese prisoners of war detained by the Soviet Union for their slave labor. The spokesman said that the Soviet Union is forcing these Japanese to work in munitions factories, aircraft construction sites, and mines. The spokesman also said that MacArthur Headquarters is extremely concerned about the Soviet Union's enslavement of Japanese prisoners of war in its controlled areas to increase the Soviet Union's military potential. He pointed out that the US Military Headquarters had requested the Soviet side to regularly repatriate 160,000 people per month a year ago, but the Soviet representative ignored this request and did not reply. According to recent US estimates, the number of Japanese prisoners of war detained in the Soviet Union is still as high as 523,316.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] A spokesman for Lieutenant General Terentii Shtykov, the Soviet representative on the Allied Control Council for Japan, told the Associated Press on the 8th that Mr. Shtykov would temporarily refrain from commenting on the Allied Headquarters spokesman's criticism that the Soviet Union was enslaving 500,000 Japanese prisoners of war and forcing them to perform hard labor. He added that Mr. Shtykov needed time to study the accusation before stating his position. Diplomatic circles believe that the Allied Headquarters spokesman's offensive has given the United States the upper hand in the Cold War propaganda offensive in the Far East. Observers believe that the facts and figures listed in MacArthur's letter to Mr. Shtykov on September 3 accusing the Soviet Union of violating the agreement leave the Soviet side with no words to answer. However, the Soviet Embassy here will surely launch a counterattack after consulting with Moscow.

### South Korean Conservative Party Ceases Overthrow Cabinet Movement

Continued Infighting Will Inevitably Lead to Mutual Destruction

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 8th] The South Korean Lee cabinet has faced domestic and international criticism and dissatisfaction due to its special circumstances and hasty establishment, which has made President Lee quite difficult. If the cabinet is reorganized or replaced, the new government's domestic credibility will be completely lost, and the international impression will also be unfavorable. The impact will be serious for the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in Paris and the recognition of Korean independence by various countries. To this end, President Lee has consulted with leaders of the Korean Democratic Party and the Society for Expediting Korean Independence on compromise issues. Recently, both the Korean Democratic Party and the Society for Expediting Korean Independence have decided to cease the overthrow cabinet movement from the 6th and adopt a cooperative attitude. The change in attitude of the Korean Democratic Party and the Society for Expediting Korean Independence also has its own inevitable difficulties. If the conservative forces in South Korea continue to engage in internal strife, they will inevitably head towards mutual destruction. Observers speculate that it is not impossible for the Lee cabinet to maintain itself for another three or four months, or even longer.

Administrative affairs are carried out by fixed officials, and France will eventually make the government more stable.

### Huge Merchants Hu Guoliang and Dai Jiaju Suspected of Illegal Foreign Exchange Trading, Arrested and Sent to Special Court; Zhan Peilin and Three Others Also Escorted Yesterday

[Our Report] Guangdong merchant Hu Guoliang was recently suspected of engaging in illegal Hong Kong foreign exchange trading. After investigation by relevant authorities, he was arrested on the 6th of this month at the home of a relative in Fanwangdu Road and escorted to the Special Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. The case has been thoroughly investigated by the relevant authorities. It is reported that Hu enjoys a high reputation among Guangdong merchants in the city and has operated China Cement Company, New New Company, and other enterprises. Dai Jiaju, a soybean merchant, was also arrested at the same time. His charge is also illegal Hong Kong foreign exchange trading. After interrogation by the prosecutor yesterday, both Hu and Dai were sent to the Special Court detention center.

Endless Shame, Avoiding the Camera

When the bailiffs escorted them out of the court, Zhan and Huang were grouped together. When the photographer took their picture, Zhan slightly lowered his head, seemingly endlessly ashamed. Huang had a worried look on his face. Wu Xilin hunched over at the waist and stayed (behind) Zhan and Huang to avoid being photographed. The bailiffs then put Zhan and the other three into a prison van and drove them to the Yangshupu Special Court detention center.

Yesterday was only a preliminary investigation. There was solid evidence for the hoarding and profiteering part, and Zhan and others did not deny it. After several more investigation sessions, the case can be closed.

### Dai Mingli Visits Operating Authorities, Requests Thorough Investigation of Newspaper Reports, Denies Colluding with Banks to Resist Orders

[Our Report] After a local evening newspaper published a report yesterday about Dai Mingli, the former Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, "contacting merchants and banks to evade large amounts of foreign exchange," reporters from this newspaper separately visited Xu Baiyuan, Lin Chongyong, and Dai Mingli to seek the truth. Vice Minister Xu said at the time that he was not aware of the reported matter of coming to Shanghai to handle Dai Mingli inciting merchants and banks to evade foreign exchange. His trip to Shanghai was only to guide commercial banks in transferring foreign exchange deposits, and there were no other tasks. Director Lin Chongyong said: He had asked Supervisor Jiang about this matter, and Jiang said that his visit to the capital to see the President was not for this matter. The Gold Control Bureau itself had not heard of this matter either. Dai Mingli himself stated: The newspaper’s report about him mentioned three points: taking advantage of his position to approve the establishment of banks and businesses for personal gain, engaging in corruption in the gold case, and devising ways for commercial banks in the city to evade foreign exchange assets. Regarding the first point, the Currency Department was only a forwarding agency, and the final decision-making power rested with the higher authorities. Whether a bank or business was approved or not was not something he could decide based on his personal feelings. As for the statement that a bank could be approved even with a capital of only one yuan, it referred to the conversion of pre-war currency into gold yuan. For example, the pre-war capital of the Siming and Tongshang Banks was 4 million each, which is now only a little more than 1 yuan and 3 jiao when calculated in gold yuan. Regarding the gold corruption case, it caused a stir in the wartime capital, and after investigation and judgment by the relevant authorities, he was not involved. There are files available for verification for the above two points. As for the accusation that he colluded with commercial banks in Shanghai to resist the law, there is even less factual basis. The transfer work is currently proceeding smoothly, and Vice Minister Xu knows this best. He is only a member of the banking community and has no power to unite all banks to resist government laws. Moreover, he has served as a civil servant for many years and would never be so insane as to do such a thing. The so-called accumulated assets of 200 million US dollars, making him as rich as a country, is even more nonsensical. After this matter was reported, he immediately took the newspaper and went to see Mr. Jiang Jingguo, but he did not meet him because Jiang was in a meeting. He then visited President Yu of the Central Bank, Vice Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance, and Director Lin of the Gold Control Bureau to request a thorough investigation. He is now waiting for the development of this matter and will not take any action for the time being. It is said that Supervisor Jiang is paying close attention to this matter and is also investigating.

### Coins to Be Minted Next Month, Mint Ordered to Resume Work, Rushing to Repair Factory Buildings and Machines

[Our Report] After the currency reform, the Central Mint in Shanghai was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to prepare to resume work and mint metal subsidiary coins. Wang Shouquan was appointed as deputy director to assist Director Wei Xianzhang in carrying out the resumption work.

It is reported that the first coins to be minted will be half-yuan silver coins and one-fen copper coins. The design of the one-fen copper coin will be based on the pre-war half-fen design, with an ancient coin on the front and a national emblem on the back. Although several designs have been proposed for the half-yuan silver coin, the Ministry of Finance has yet to make a final decision.

However, according to the Bureau's news yesterday, due to a typhoon at sea recently, there is no news of departure as of last night, so it is feared that it will not be able to return to Shanghai as scheduled. In addition, the Hai Lie ship will also be ordered to go to Osaka to load 4,000 tons of copper-nickel coins to return to the country. The ship is currently loading mineral sand at Yulin Port, and the Bureau has sent a telegram urging it to quickly sail to Osaka for loading.

The defendant, Deng Zhonghe, stated: He made statements in newspapers such as Shen Bao, Xin Bao, and Qianxian Bao about the truth of the special donation for relief and Zhu's claim that he was a traitor. He claimed that there was factual basis for referring to Zhu as a "threatening bandit." In July and August of the 29th year, Zhu impersonated the commander of Su Yingzhong's team and sent him two letters. His wife and elder brother contacted Zhu at the Grand Theatre and Dasanyuan, and later paid 12,000 yuan at Zhu's home. He himself did not meet with Zhu. On June 26 and 30 of the following year, he received two more letters, which said, "If you don't pay, please don't regret it." He ignored them. He also claimed that Su Yingzhong's team had been disbanded in the 28th year, and Zhang Lei, whom Zhu referred to, also denied writing the letter. Zhu Zhengwen, the plaintiff, then testified, saying that he had served as a special agent in the Special Operations Office of the Former Military Affairs Commission's Detached Corps. Su Yingzhong's team was a peripheral unit organized by the Special Operations Office, and Zhang Lei was also a comrade. He came to Shanghai in the 29th year to carry out anti-traitor work. Although the Detached Corps was disbanded in the 28th year and the underground work was suspended, he obtained Zhang Lei's consent at the time to ask Deng for financial assistance, which was a patriotic act. As for the letters sent to Deng, two of them were written by Zhang Lei, and he did not know about the others. After the testimony, Deng filed a counter-suit against Zhu in court, with the following reasons: (1) Slander: Zhu accused me of being a traitor and providing funds to the enemy because there are three at 34 Bailinan Road, one of which is the Japanese Toyota Yarn Factory, and Zhu insisted that my factory was the Japanese factory. (2) Extortion by forging a name, (3) Fabricating a letter from Wan Lilang to falsely accuse a traitor. The court ordered a postponement for investigation of the case.

### "Femme Fatale" Unhappy After Marriage, Falls in Love with Storyteller, Both Are in Police Bureau

[Our Report] Cheng Qingtong, a Suzhou native who runs a fancy goods business, met Li Ming, a dancer nicknamed "Femme Fatale," at the Lidu Ballroom last year. They were engaged in Shanghai on March 10 of the same year and married at his home at 65, Miaotang Lane, Suzhou on June 5. Three months after the marriage, the "beauty" was unwilling to stay at home, and their relationship gradually became estranged. In the third month of this year, Li used the excuse of visiting relatives in Shanghai and was unwilling to return to Suzhou. Despite repeated urging, she ignored them. Later, in August, Li Ming returned to Suzhou and took away all the valuable clothing and accessories. Cheng chased her to the station, but failed to persuade her to stay. After Li came to Shanghai alone, her whereabouts were unknown. Until recently, Cheng read in the newspaper that Li had changed her name to Liu Ruiqing, still worked as a dancer at the Metropolitan, and lived in room 418 of the Xinxin Hotel on Nanjing Road. He also learned that she had already had an affair with Zhu Xiaoxiang, who sang and told stories at the Cangzhou Shuchang and Xinxianlin. Cheng then reported to the Laozha Police Station yesterday morning, and they sent officers to go with him to the residence at the Xinxin Hotel. The door was locked from the inside, and they were still sleeping soundly. When they opened the door, the two were speechless. Because the case involved adultery, they were taken to the bureau for questioning, and many valuable clothing and accessories were recovered.

### Garrison Headquarters Refutes Rumors: Reports of Xiong Storing Goods Are Inaccurate

According to information from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters: There are rumors circulating in the Shanghai market claiming that Northern capital is gathering in Shanghai to engage in commerce, with many having connections to prominent military and political figures in North China. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters has received telegrams from both General Fu Zuoyi, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in North China, and Xiong Shihui, former Director of the Northeast Administrative Council, inquiring about the matter and requesting a thorough investigation. Commander Xuan has investigated the relevant security inspection agencies and found no cases of stockpiling of goods related to either Fu or Xiong. It is clear that someone is spreading rumors with the intention of slander. The source of the rumors has been ordered to be investigated.

### Family Massacre on Fenyang Road: Sick Husband Kills and Injures Five; Liu Zhixiong Arrested on the Spot; Mother Provides Three Reasons

[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 8:45 AM yesterday, a major family homicide occurred at No. 64, Alley 64 (Bixunfang) on Fenyang Road, the home of Liu Yintang, the owner of the Huaqi Import and Export Company. Five people were killed or injured, and the perpetrator, Liu Zhixiong, was arrested on the spot. The details of the case are complex and are reported as follows:

Liu Yintang, the 38-year-old owner of Huaqi Import and Export Company on Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, is from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. He currently resides at No. 6, Bixunfang, Fenyang Road. His father, Liu Yijia, is over seventy years old, and his mother, Li, is sixty-one years old. He has a wife, Liu Xiao Ru, and several children. The family of seven or eight lives harmoniously. Yintang has a paternal uncle, Liu Yu Zhai, also known as Liu Ruxiang, who served as the Director of the Business Bureau of the puppet Central Reserve Bank during the enemy occupation. In his youth, Liu relied on his uncle's support and his career flourished, bringing the family to a comfortable level. Yu Zhai had a son named Zhixiong, also known as Guohan, who is 27 years old. He was spoiled and extravagant from a young age. He attended Datong University but later suffered from lung disease and stayed home to recuperate.

During the enemy occupation, Liu Yu Zhai used his position to accumulate considerable wealth and acquired numerous properties. After the victory, Liu was arrested and transferred to the High Court on charges of treason, sentenced to fifteen years in prison, and most of his real estate was confiscated. Afterward, Liu's second wife, Liu Zheng Yingrou, moved with Zhixiong and seven or eight other family members to No. 139, Anhe Temple Road. Their daily expenses relied on the support of his nephew, Liu Yintang. Zhixiong suffered from lung disease and stayed at Zhongshan Hospital for several months. After doctors performed surgery and removed four ribs, he recovered, but his body had not yet fully recovered, and all medical expenses were borne by his cousin, Yintang.

Liu Zhixiong started a business after being discharged from the hospital, but unfortunately, he had no luck and accumulated a large debt. He repeatedly asked Yintang for loans, but his requests were not granted, causing him resentment. He also learned from rumors that his father had hidden one hundred gold bars with Yintang before his arrest, and he repeatedly demanded their return, which fueled his hatred and led him to consider murder. At around 8:45 AM yesterday, Zhixiong hid a grenade and a US military knife and waited at the back door of No. 6, Bixunfang, Fenyang Road. Soon after, Yintang went out the back door to go to work. He stepped forward, grabbed his suit, and said, "I have a grenade hidden on me. Let's go inside and talk." As soon as he finished speaking, he pulled out the grenade. Yintang's wife, Liu Xiao Ru, heard the noise and looked out, seeing Ke Xiong trying to drag Yintang through the back door. She quickly tried to stop him, but Zhixiong pushed her to the ground.

Liu Yintang saw an opportunity and ran away. Unexpectedly, Zhixiong threw the grenade. With a loud bang, shrapnel flew everywhere. Wu Chengheng, who was delivering bread, had his nose blown off. Liu and his wife were spared. At this point, the perpetrator disregarded everything and went straight to the third floor. He saw Liu's mother, Li, holding her granddaughter, Liu Nanqiong (two years old), and took out the US military knife, stabbing Li in the chest, penetrating her back. She fell to the ground and died, and the girl was also stabbed in the head. He returned to the second floor and saw Liu's father, Yijia, in the outhouse, and stabbed him in the left abdomen. Seeing the terrible disaster he had caused, the perpetrator, fearing punishment, stabbed himself in the left abdomen. His right foot was also injured by shrapnel, and he collapsed.

After receiving the report, the Changshu District Police Branch, led by Chief Yan Chengsheng and Deputy Chief Yan Xianghu, rushed to the scene with Criminal Section Chief Ren Gongqin and Patrol Officers Zhao Yulin and Huang Yujun. Subsequently, Xia Lian, the Commander of the 3rd Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, also arrived with Squad Leader Yan Jinwen after hearing the news. They immediately called for ambulances to send the injured to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The body of the deceased, Liu Li, was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Mortuary for examination. The perpetrator was sent directly to the Police Academy. The branch then summoned the perpetrator's stepmother, Liu Zheng Yingrou, for questioning. According to her statement, there were three reasons for Zhixiong's murderous intentions: (1) He suffered from stage three lung disease and had asked Liu's father, Yijia, to inform Yintang of his request for a large sum of money to treat the disease, but his request was not granted. (2) After Zhixiong was sent to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment, he insisted on staying in a first-class room, but Yintang refused, and he was discharged after several months. (3) Zhixiong had once requested a loan of 500 million legal tender, but only received 200 million. (This) caused this tragic family tragedy.

### The Magnificent Prospects of Pingxiang Coal

— Our Newspaper Reporter, Liu Zao

In the next three years, Pingxiang Coal may become electrified and mechanized. The estimated daily coal production may reach 4,000 tons, and various native mines may also produce 1,000 tons of coal. In terms of transportation, 100 coal trains carrying 5,000 tons of coal per day will be needed, making it the most modern and largest coal mine in China. Therefore, Pingxiang Coal has a grand and beautiful future.

Purchasing Native Mines and Carrying Out Repairs

[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanchang, 5th via Airmail] The initial planning for postwar reconstruction is just the beginning of the future prospects. During the war, the Anyuan mining area fell into enemy hands, and locals seized the opportunity to open native mines. By the time the Jiangxi Coal Mine Bureau was established for postwar reconstruction, there were already over a hundred native mines. Although these native mines appeared to be operated by impoverished people relying on their own strength to earn a living in the coal pits, there were still malicious forces supporting them behind the scenes. These native mines had a significant impact on large-scale, planned, and systematic mining in the future. After several discussions with the native mine operators, the mining bureau reached an agreement, but the agreement was not fully implemented. Therefore, the mining bureau has now established a temporary engineering office in Anyuan to manage and assist in the mining of native mines and to purchase four larger native mines for repair and renovation, preparing to start mining operations.

Native Mining Methods: Three People Per Ton

When the Gaokeng Mine was rebuilt after the war, coal was first extracted from the existing native mines, including the first, third, and Wangjia Yuan's 4.5 native mines. The total output is currently only a few dozen tons per day. The third mine is a larger adit, 180 meters long, with double-track railways for transportation. Inside, there is a 45-degree slope leading directly to the main coal bin. The top board inclined shaft is equipped with an electric coal hoist. Coal at the bottom of the shaft is hoisted by the coal hoist to the adit, loaded into mine carts, and then pushed by manpower along a light railway for 1.8 kilometers to the Baimiao Coal Plant. It is then unloaded into coal cars via a coal chute and transported via the Quangao branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to the Quanjia Yi'an station, then west to Zhuzhou and east to Nanhang. Currently, the coal produced in the third mine is only from the main coal seam. The mine has some mechanical equipment, but other mines almost all use native mining methods. Currently, over 1,500 miners work in three shifts, averaging one ton of coal per three people. In the future, the efficiency of mechanical mining can be increased threefold.

Drilling Progress Suddenly Doubles

The No. 1 and No. 2 main shafts at Changtangwei were continued after the war, but progress was slow due to insufficient power, progressing only 20 feet per month. In April of this year, with the addition of mechanical equipment, the drilling speed suddenly doubled. The diameter of the above-mentioned shafts is planned to be increased to 18 feet in order to achieve large-scale production in the future. The shafts are temporarily supported by wooden frames and will be lined with reinforced concrete in the future. The bedrock at the bottom of the shaft is drilled using a compressed air drill for one and a half hours, to a depth of about three to four feet, and then explosives are used. On average, drilling takes about three hours, while hauling stone slag and water takes five hours. The hoisting equipment consists of electric winch cars that raise and lower 14-cubic-foot iron buckets. The project, including bottom progress and ground work, involves 14 workers and one engineer per shift, with a monthly progress of about 45 feet.

Power Equipment Trending Towards Electrification

In terms of power equipment, the coal plant is currently working hard to electrify in order to save manpower and increase production. Near the new shaft at Changtangwei, a 50-horsepower electric winch, a compressor with a capacity of 315 cubic feet per minute, and a 75-kilowatt diesel engine were added in April of this year. About one mile from the new shaft, in a place called Xiaochong, there is a temporary power plant and a small repair shop with two 200-KVA generators, supplying electricity to the entire plant. The plant performs ordinary repairs and is equipped with ordinary parts, but the equipment is simple and insufficient.

Installing New Machines in Preparation for Trial Electrification

The power plant at Quanjia Yi'an is being built in a barren mountainous area. The engineer in charge of the project is Chen Bangshu, the young, dark-skinned director of the Electrical Engineering Department of the Jiangxi Coal Mine Bureau, and his large straw hat fully demonstrates his perseverance and hard work. I met him for the first time in Quanjia, and my only impression was that he was straightforward, sincere, and hardworking. The new machinery at the Quanjia Yi'an power plant has been installed, and they are working day and night to complete the installation. The technicians are afraid of the heat of the machines on hot days, so they work early in the morning or in the evening to speed up the work. When I left Quanjia, they were preparing to test the electricity. Because the construction of the factory building will take some time, it was decided to generate electricity in the open air first to supply electricity to the entire mine.

The Quanjia Yi'an power plant is a large family because they have named this reclaimed land Quanjia New Village. The families of the employees all live together, organize their own food cooperatives, and cook their own meals. Men, women, and lively children all live and work together, and the atmosphere is warm and harmonious.

Mass Production Plans Have Been Determined

Plans for large-scale production at the Gaokeng Coal Mine have been determined. For large-scale production, the No. 1 and No. 2 vertical shaft projects at Changtangwei are planned to be expanded to a diameter of 18 feet. The total depth of the shafts will be about 950 feet. Stone doors will be opened at 625 feet and 950 feet to connect the coal seams. No. 1 vertical shaft will be equipped with two cages, which will be raised and lowered by a 600-horsepower electric winch, specifically for raising and lowering stone slag, materials, and workers. No. 2 vertical shaft will be equipped with two seven-ton coal hoists, which will be raised and lowered by a 1,200-horsepower electric winch. The coal loading under the coal hoist and the unloading at the wellhead are all automatic, without the need for manpower.

New Equipment Being Prepared for Implementation

In order to increase production and reduce manpower, the equipment in the well is being mechanized, and the design engineering for each item is nearing completion and will be implemented soon. The new machinery to be used in the well in the future includes three-ton coal carts (for loading and transporting coal), electric trains (for transporting coal under the well and on the ground), automatic stone loading machines (for loading stone slag or coal), duckbill transfer machines (for loading coal at the working face and transporting coal in the roadway), chain conveyors (for transporting coal in the roadway), compressed air drills (for opening bedrock roadways), coal car traction machines (for controlling coal car transportation), tipping cages (for automatic unloading of coal), cage angles (for controlling coal car entry into the cage), cage locks and safety equipment (for the No. 1 shaft hoist), coal hoists (for automatic unloading of coal), automatic electric pumps (for underground drainage), electric fans (for underground ventilation), signal controllers (for underground traffic control), and underground coal bins (for automatic opening and closing to control coal discharge).

This mechanical equipment is powered by electricity or compressed air and has all safety equipment to prevent accidents and dangers underground. They now have a hope: that in three years, the Gaokeng Mine will be able to achieve a daily coal production of 5,000 tons, becoming the most modern coal mine in the country.

### Qiantang River Tidal Bore Washes Away Haining Embankment: Houses Collapse and People Die

— (Our Newspaper Reporter Liu Zao Photograph)

[Our Newspaper's Report from Haining, 7th] With the arrival of the autumn flood season and the continuous torrential rains, the tidal bore of the Qiantang River has been surging for days, a rare occurrence in the past ten years. At around 2:00 AM on the 7th, the night tide surged, reaching a height of several feet. The embankments in various areas along the river in this county were destroyed, and countless houses and people were drowned, causing an unprecedented tragedy. According to preliminary investigations, the following has been determined: (1) In the Wengbu 15th Bao area, more than 30 thatched houses were washed away, over 10,000 pieces of boarding were swept away, and dozens of people were killed or injured. The exact number has not yet been determined. (2) In Yuanmu Township, 40 to 50 thatched houses were washed away, and 17 people died. The actual losses are still under investigation. (3) In the section from Nanshan Bridge to Dashi Bridge in the urban area, dozens of sections of the embankment were destroyed. The tidal bore entered the earthen dikes, washing away four thatched houses and injuring one person. (4) Approximately one Chinese mile of stone embankment from Sanliqiao to Siliqiao was destroyed. (5) The "Yi Gao," "Guan," "Xian," "Xiang," "Du," "Yi Yi Zhong," "Li," "Cheng," and "Meng" character sea dikes at Qilimiao have all been destroyed by the tidal bore. The upper half of the stone embankment in the area about six Chinese miles east of the Meng character dike has also been destroyed. In order to protect the safety of the embankment and the lives of the people in the seven districts, the local people have launched a petition to appeal to the provincial authorities for effective repairs as soon as possible. (6) One zhang of the "Hu" character stone embankment at Jiuli Bridge and the "Xian" and "Qian" character stone embankments have completely collapsed. The residents along the embankment are in a state of panic and are relocating. The local court dispatched personnel today to examine the corpses in various locations, and the county government is continuing its investigation and providing relief.

### Family Homicide Occurs in Jinan: Kong Chang Chops Wife Seven Times, Locks Door and Hangs Himself

[Our Newspaper's Report from Jinan, 8th] Kong Chang, an employee of a certain military organization here, was dismissed five days ago due to the organization's downsizing. After losing his job, he faced financial difficulties and often argued with his wife, Zhang. At around 3:00 PM on September 6th, Kong was impulsively struck by a trivial matter and repeatedly chopped his wife's head seven times with a kitchen knife, causing her to bleed profusely. Fortunately, Zhang's mother and neighbors rescued her and rushed her to the Municipal Hospital for emergency treatment. Due to the severity of her injuries, she was still not out of danger by the evening. However, what followed was even more tragic: while neighbors were sending her to the hospital, Kong took advantage of the lack of attention, locked himself in the room, and hanged himself with a rope. By the time the nearby police heard the news, broke down the door, and entered, he had already died.

### Tragic Car Accident in Qingdao: Ziguang and Song Zhesheng Killed

[Our Newspaper's Report from Qingdao, 8th] Ziguang, a famous singer in Qingdao, died in a car accident yesterday afternoon while returning from the airport after seeing off a guest. Six soldiers were with her, two died and four were injured. Another deceased person was Song Zhesheng, a lieutenant colonel officer of the Air-Ground Liaison Team. The cause of the accident is said to be a collision with a US military vehicle. Both the Chinese and US sides are jointly investigating.

### Re-Survey of the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway Completed: Tunnels Planned in Jiangxi Province

[Our Newspaper's Report from Shangrao, 6th] The re-survey of the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway, previously divided into three lines, has been fully completed. The Jiangxi section of the route has also been decided by the Ministry of Communications to adopt the third line after the re-survey (starting from Yingtan, passing through Jinxi, Nancheng, and ending in Guangze), with a total length of 207 kilometers. It will be necessary to excavate ten tunnels at Huangshiling, Hongmenling, Linfengling, Jigongling, Tasha, and Shanguan Bishan, and to erect 41 large bridges. The most difficult section of the entire project is approximately 23 kilometers from Chating to Shanguan. Nie Zhaoling, the current Director of the Rao Xiang Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Engineering Office, has been ordered to concurrently serve as the Director of the Nan (ping) Ying (tan) Section Engineering Office. Ge Fuxi has been appointed as the Captain of the first detailed survey team, Ji Xunhuang as the Captain of the second team, and Lu Huang as the Captain of the third team. It is said that the Ministry of Communications has designated the Yingtan to Nancheng section to begin construction first, reportedly to connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Also, the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been operating well since the opening of the transportation vehicles. However, there are currently over 20 kilometers of light rail weighing 25 pounds, which affects the speed of the vehicles. The railway bureau is currently transporting a large number of heavy rails and plans to complete the emergency repairs within half a month.

### Transfer of Foreign Exchange Assets to National Banks: Over Half of Shanghai Banks Have Reported; Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan Returned to Beijing by Overnight Train Yesterday to Report Back

[Our Newspaper's Report] Preparations for the commercial banks' transfer of foreign exchange gold and silver to the Central Bank are expected to be completed today. The authorities have ordered commercial banks in the city to complete the reporting work by 12:00 noon today; the deadline for insurance companies, money shops, and trust companies to complete the reporting is 4:00 PM today.

Yesterday, about half of the more than 80 commercial banks in the city reported. Provincial and municipal banks are being handled in the same way as commercial banks. In consideration of practical needs, the deadline may be extended slightly. Foreign exchange assets of branches of various banks are also being reported by the head offices. The report list is to be signed and sealed by the managers of the various banks, money shops, and companies to show its solemnity. In the future, if any misconduct or misrepresentation is discovered, they will be held fully responsible. As Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan is scheduled to return to Beijing by overnight train last night to report back, the report list of money shops and companies will be received by the Financial Administration. They will be reviewed first in Beijing to determine whether they are accurate and reliable. Once the review work is completed, the total amount will be announced.

Yesterday, a reporter met with Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan and asked him to estimate the amount of the transfer. Mr. Xu politely declined, but said that the rumored amount of US$300 million was slightly too high. He also said that the transfer of foreign exchange to the Central Bank is not a donation. Within the scope approved by the government, commercial money shops can still use their foreign exchange assets. For example, importing production tools, purchasing gold yuan bonds, etc. The government will announce detailed measures in the future. Also, the transfer of foreign exchange will not cause losses to commercial money shops, and the cooperation between the government and the private sector will consolidate the credit of the gold yuan. Foreign exchange will no longer be traded on the black market, and commercial money shops will no longer be criticized by society for the black market.

### Few Arrivals, Stagnant Sales: Rice Market Continues to Decline; Flour Price Rises Slightly, Edible Oil Stable

Yesterday, the rice market continued to decline. White japonica and early indica rice in both the North and South markets have retreated to the price limit. Although arrivals have decreased due to rain, sales are even more stagnant. Rice shops have weak appetites, and prices have finally declined. The market opened steady, but gradually weakened. White japonica in the North market was 20 yuan and 80 cents, a decrease of 20 cents. Early indica rice remained stable, and sheep indica rice fell by 33 cents. White japonica in the South market fell by 23 cents. High-quality milled indica rice and coarse milled indica rice each fell by 50 cents. However, white yuan rice and new japonica rice remained at the price limit due to scarce arrivals. Yesterday, arrivals in the South market were 784 dan, and 1,062 dan in the North market, for a total of 1,846 dan.

Flour

Rose slightly, but trading was calm. As the warehouse receipts were delivered before the deadline, the market is now dominated by spot sales. Also, due to the scarcity of supply from the factories, the market remains strong. Battleship flour opened very low at 7 yuan and 15 cents, but quickly rose to 7 yuan and 25 cents, a slight increase of 1 cent. Lao Che flour opened at 7 yuan and 55 cents, an increase of 5 cents. Red Bee flour did not trade. Jiancheng flour opened at 7 yuan and 25 cents. Miscellaneous brands varied slightly, but trading was very low. Bran remained at the price limit due to the lack of supply from the factories. Wheat remained unchanged at 10 yuan and 3 cents.

Miscellaneous Grains

The market situation has changed little, but the supply is still good. Soybean oil factories are taking in goods, and there are many transactions. New beans are being sold in this street, and some have been sold. Qingdao corn continues to be added, and the price is one dime. Buyers are also interested in sorghum, and trading is brisk, with around 400 packages being sold. Yuanmai sales are stagnant and have not opened. Green beans have little trading. Sesame is still trading at the limit. Buyers from Guangdong are not taking in peanuts, and the market is weak with few buyers.

Edible Oil

Stable and uneventful. Soybean oil factory prices remain at the previous day's level. Datong factory opened at 49 yuan and 70 cents, but spot prices at the close of the market weakened slightly by 30 cents due to the approaching deadline for the delivery of warehouse receipts. Other spot soybean oil prices also weakened slightly. Rapeseed oil remains at 46 yuan. The export of crude oil from Qingdao to the south has been banned, which has strengthened confidence, so it remains firm at the price limit. Refined crude oil is 59 yuan and 90 cents. Small cart sesame oil is also experiencing a feeling of shortage due to scarce stock and supply, with the price of small cart oil at 50 yuan per barrel. Buyers remain weak for soybean cake. The factory price remains at 4 yuan and 60 cents. As inventory is low, supply and demand are both scarce, and trading is light.

### Abundant Hemp and Cotton Production in Zhejiang Province

[Our Dispatch] Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, has returned from inspecting cotton and hemp planting in Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, Haining, Fengxian, and Minhang. According to him, the general situation is quite good, especially the hemp production this year, which is particularly abundant. It is estimated that Zhejiang Province can produce about 450,000 dan of cotton and 600,000 dan of hemp this year. However, there may be some difficulties in purchasing this year, as speculative capital has already gathered in the countryside.

Hemp production in Zhejiang Province is concentrated in the eastern part. The hemp seeds used this year were brought from India and Taiwan by the Textile Construction Company. The Indian variety yields about 7 dan per mu, while the mixed variety yields about 4.5 to 5 dan per mu, resulting in a doubled yield compared to last year. Cotton production has been affected by frequent rainfall in recent months, hindering boll formation. Local cotton varieties are the worst affected, yielding only 60-70 jin of seed cotton per mu. Improved cotton varieties were first introduced to Zhejiang Province last year but only account for 15% of the province's total cotton production. Although the yield per mu exceeds 100 jin, the impact on the overall yield increase is limited. It is hoped that the weather will turn sunny soon to prevent severe impact on cotton production.

### Artificial Silk Price Adjustment: Fully Calculated Based on Market Price

Due to cost considerations, the Central Trust Bureau plans to calculate this week's artificial silk allocation price based on the full market price on August 19th.

However, collection will proceed at last week's listed price, and any difference will be collected later after the new price is determined. As for the allocation quantity this week, in addition to the original 30% allocation, a temporary quota increase of 30% will be added. The colors and patterns will be determined by the barter office after consultation and will still be the responsibility of each guild to directly coordinate and distribute and report.

(2) Banks should increase their capital by one-tenth of the actual amount for each new branch established. The banking industry has some questions about this and plans to ask the Ministry of Finance for interpretation. After formulating its opinions, the group will submit them to the Banking Association for review before submitting them to the Ministry of Finance.

### Factories Selling Actively, Viscose Yarn Sales Stagnant, Cloth Transactions Dull, Morale Low

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw active sales from factories due to the still loose money market, while sales were stagnant, creating a situation of oversupply. The price of 20-count yarn once fell within the limit. Fine yarn supply in the market was limited as each yarn factory directly opened sales to the replication industry, but demand was also scarce, and the market atmosphere was peaceful. 42-count Jincheng yarn is currently sold at 1,033 yuan, and 21-count Shuangma yarn at 783 yuan, with transactions returning to normal.

Another report: After the authorities strictly controlled cotton yarn, more sales turned to Jinling Road, where yarn shops have been supplying at the limited price, with each person limited to buying a small package. At Xintai, Yongtaichang, China Yarn and Cloth Company, etc., people are lining up to buy.

### Zhongfang Selling Yarn

[Our Dispatch] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn separately in the yarn market and at its company listing yesterday. A total of 384 pieces were sold in the market, receiving 271,488 yuan.

### Silver Subsidiary Coin Exchange for Gold Yuan: Three Double-Hao Coins Exchange for One Yuan, Daily Discount for Silver Shops Revised to Two Yuan

[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank's Business Bureau recently sent a circular to its branches, stating that the emergency decree on financial and economic measures already has provisions for the exchange of silver and silver dollars. However, there are no explicit provisions regarding the exchange of silver subsidiary coins for gold yuan. According to the previous regulation of exchanging 12 jiao in silver coins for one yuan, the method for exchanging gold yuan is determined by analogy. That is, three double-hao coins or six single-hao coins exchange for one gold yuan, to ensure uniformity.

It is also learned that the Central Bank's Audit Department recently sent a circular to its branches, stating that from September 1st, the Shanghai Silver Industry will revise the interbank daily discount to two yuan, and the loan daily discount to three yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Transactions Target Limited Door Shops and Cloth Wholesalers

The cotton cloth market is increasingly uneasy as the authorities are strictly inspecting warehouses and storage facilities. Moreover, goods handled by out-of-town merchants cannot be smuggled. Therefore, some merchants from the north started selling at the beginning, and local shops and retail investors also came to sell. Many in the industry also closed out. Merchants from the Yangtze River region and Xuzhou and Bengbu regions rarely absorbed goods, and transactions were sparse. Dyeing factories, facing stagnant sales of colored cloth to avoid capital closure, turned to reselling white坯 cloth in the market.

Under the guidance of the authorities, brokers in the market only conduct transactions with door shops and cloth wholesalers. For numbered shops and guest houses, they are allowed to sell on their behalf but refuse to buy on their behalf. It is also reported that goods transported on the road must carry a transaction receipt for inspection. If it is found that the goods are being transported to a numbered shop, intervention will occur. Everyone is intimidated by the authorities' strict measures to suppress prices, and morale is low.

12-pound Longtou fine cloth was initially sold by Yongxin Cloth Shop at 29.3 yuan per piece for 600 pieces. Retail investors then engaged in mutual sales, dropping the price to 28.5 yuan, and finally to 28.8 yuan, a further decrease of 0.5 yuan from the previous day. Si Junzi Yuan Biji only dropped by 0.2 yuan due to brisk sales in the cool autumn. Jin Yun Miaowu Yuan Biji was sought after by Hankou merchants and remained steady at the original price of 27.6 yuan. Other cloths also retreated, with the biggest drop being 0.7 yuan for Laba B fine cloth.

Another report: Wufu B fine cloth, which is sold by Textile Construction Company every other day, is priced at 23.8 yuan, with each household allocated 40 pieces uniformly. Wansan bleached cloth is 26.8 yuan, with each household allocated 20 pieces. It is also learned that recently, door shops in the city, such as Rixinsheng, Xindaxiang, and Xiedaxiang, have been queuing up to sell limited-price cloth at 8:00 every morning, but the trademarks are still being cut off. It is also learned that Huafeng Dyeing Factory has 100 pieces of 390 Meiting Shilin on sale.

### Tea Loan Increased Tenfold: Not Approved by the Authorities

[Our Dispatch] This reporter recently met with Mr. Han, General Manager of Anhui Tea Company, who stated that the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Sales Office recently sent representatives to discuss the promotion of black tea produced by various cooperatives in Qimen this year. As a result, the Qimen Shawan Cooperative has reached an agreement and has sent Ma Xibai to Shanghai to oversee everything. It is reported that a large amount of goods will arrive soon.

It is also learned that the Tea Association here previously telegraphed the Four Joint Offices, requesting that the tea loan for this year be increased tenfold, to 80 million to 100 million yuan per dan, and that the deadline be extended to three months. Due to the authorities' implementation of emergency economic control policies, this has not been approved. However, tea merchants believe that tea is not only related to foreign sales but also sufficient to affect domestic production. Therefore, they plan to send representatives to the capital to request instructions and also seek to reduce the tea loan interest rate.

Yesterday's tea market saw stable domestic tea prices, while foreign tea varieties were in high demand with limited supply, and their prices were firm.

### Resettling Refugee Students from Secondary Schools in Bandit-Controlled Areas: Temporary Secondary Schools Should Be Run by Local Authorities; Expenses and Relief Funds Can Be Requested from the Ministry of Education

However, the required expenses and relief funds for refugee students from bandit-controlled areas can still be requested from the Ministry of Education for approval or fundraising. As for the temporary secondary schools of Yuzhou and Zhongyuan, which were temporarily established by the Ministry due to the urgent situation of Kaifeng being captured by bandits, the Henan Provincial Education Department has been ordered to send personnel to take over.

### Mooncakes

— Zhibai

It is truly autumn. The watermelon stalls along Nanjing Road have all disappeared. A few days ago, a red-paper-wrapped wooden sign proudly proclaimed "Authentic Package - Flat South Gate Watermelon". Today, the wooden sign is still wrapped in red paper, but the words have been changed to "Mooncakes on Sale." Children admire them, watching the hot ovens all around.

Suddenly, I recall that every year around the Mid-Autumn Festival, newspapers often feature timely articles discussing how expensive Mid-Autumn Festival gifts are, how business in shops has declined compared to previous years... and almost every year there is a sentence: "The largest mooncake at ×× Garden costs so much money, it's truly astounding!" I often wonder: Does anyone really buy these large mooncakes? Besides placing them on the table to elicit a compliment from guests, what's the point? There are many things that can be used to flaunt wealth, many things more clever and refined than such a large mooncake. Why bother with such a large and clumsy mooncake? When it comes to eating it, you need to "cut and slice," which is so inconsistent with the mood of a reunion dinner!

A few days ago, I saw a newly arrived Western magazine. In the white space on one page, it wrote: "Before you criticize the lunch menu for being too bad, please consider: At least a quarter of the world's population is starving to death!" At that moment, I was reminded of many things: the old and young refugee families begging on the streets, the students who fled the war zone begging in groups—and, indeed, I thought of the large mooncakes at ×× Garden. What is the highest price per mooncake this year, I wonder?

However, the newspapers say that the government has decided to urge people to practice thrift and strictly prohibit Mid-Autumn Festival gift-giving. Food stores are also not allowed to produce mooncakes in an extravagant and wasteful manner (roughly speaking).

This is indeed a very wise measure. However, relying solely on laws is not enough. The most important thing at present is that a simple and unadorned atmosphere must be thoroughly cultivated from top to bottom.

I have a friend who lives a very serious life. He doesn't drink, smoke, gamble, or dance. He is very responsible at work and is never late or early. However, his unexpected expenses every month are still considerable, and he is never the one to get promoted during the company's annual performance review. What are his unexpected expenses? It turns out that there is a very popular clerk in their company who remembers the birthdays of every manager, deputy manager, and their wives. When the time comes, he takes a big red hat and asks everyone to sign their names in order to give gifts. When the manager recently had a grandson, everyone immediately sent a congratulatory glutinous rice and ginger dish. When the deputy manager recently took a concubine, everyone immediately sent congratulatory gifts. My friend spends a third of his salary on this every month, but there is no way out, he can't escape! Perhaps because he hasn't been able to very happily and nicely take out money every time, the clerk, Zhang Sheng, secretly says behind his back that he "has no style!"

Their manager always advocates frugality and hard work, but he never opposes the gift-giving trend among his subordinates. He attaches great importance to everyone's "appearance," saying that it is "related to the company's reputation." The clerk often says that my friend "has little style," so the manager has heard about it over time. Since the impression is bad, my friend is out of luck.

In fact, I think every Shanghainese suffers to some extent because of the word "style." When I was in the inland areas, people didn't mind if I wore old clothes. At that time, I imagined that perhaps I could change the idea of "judging people by their clothes" if I went there. Who knew that when everyone came to Shanghai, the first thing they did was to make a lot of clothes! You make them, he makes them, everyone makes them, and as a result, you feel like you have to make them too. Do you have a lot of money? Not necessarily—"style" is important! As a result: in terms of the income of the average Shanghainese, if they are willing to be content with "plain clothes, warm food, and full stomach," they would probably be able to get by. However, they simply refuse to give up "style," so those who should wear blue cloth robes insist on wearing serge, and those who should eat one meat dish and two vegetable dishes insist on eating two meat dishes and one vegetable dish. They clearly earn a monthly salary of two hundred yuan, but their living expenses and everything else give others the feeling that they earn five hundred yuan a month, even if it means going into debt.

Take the large mooncakes at ×× Garden, for example. Is the taste of large mooncakes really that different from the inexpensive small mooncakes? The reason why a few "huge things" are inevitably produced every year is only to meet the needs of people who pursue "style."

I hope that when large mooncakes are banned, this "style concept" that harms people so much will also be thoroughly eradicated!

### Reading Uncle Fan's Inscription on Shen Yunying's Hand Scroll: Two Casual Poems

— Huang Yunmei

How much heroism have these moth-like eyebrows seen? History's pen is unfairly biased. A generation's fame belongs to the stone mausoleum, who can truly tell of Shen Yunying? (The History of Ming, Biography of Zhang Xianzhong, states that Xianzhong attacked Daozhou, and the garrison commander Shen Zhixu died in battle. His daughter fought again to retrieve her father's body, saving the city, and so on.)

The remaining ink is sparse and uncommon, adding more melancholy to the rise and fall of dynasties. I feared it would fall into the hands of Mei Cun, but after three hundred years, I have finally met you.

### Feeling on the River Embankment

— Ding Daoheng

The wind rushes, and catkins fly wildly along the riverbank, all sorts of quiet thoughts help to dispel my soul. What taste does spring have with orioles flying and grass growing? Pledges of love and mountains are dead, don't even mention them. The rippling stream tides still come morning and evening, the simple thatched cottages are still cold and warm. After ten years, I have thoroughly understood and held onto my wife, and have not received a bit of kindness from the Udumbara flower.

### Moonlight Bath and Other Things

— Qifeng

The love of beauty is human nature; especially for women, they can hardly live without the word "beauty" in their lives. American women spend as much as 600 million U.S. dollars on cosmetics alone each year. In addition, the huge expenses in beauty salons are too numerous to count.

In fact, beauty is timeless; the "newest" beauty may be the "oldest" beauty.

Sunbathing has recently become extremely popular in the United States. They believe that it is not only beneficial to health, but also enhances beauty. In movies and magazines, we often see men and women wearing swimsuits and sunglasses, leisurely lying in the sun, tanning their skin a brownish-red color. But little do they know that sunbathing was very popular in Italy in the 15th century. At that time, a group of fashionable young women also liked to take moonlight baths in the quiet moonlight!

In recent years, many women like to comb their hair upwards, clamping it with hairpins, which is cool and comfortable, commonly known as "Taoist head." Little do they know that this new-style hairstyle was adopted by South American Indian women a long time ago. They rub sticky honey into their hair, and then apply iridescent or pearlescent fish scales to their hair to make it particularly bright and radiant.

How seductive it is to paint red or purple nail polish on fingernails or toenails! Some people say: This is truly an extraordinary expression of beauty; but these modern women who love to use nail polish are really lagging behind; we certainly know that ancient Chinese women knew how to use the petals of balsam flowers to dye their nails, making them emit a light red or deep red light.

Not long ago, an explorer excavated an ancient Peruvian tomb, in which was buried a female mummy. It is estimated that the woman was buried in the ground as early as a thousand years ago, but after he carefully observed it, this thousand-year-old female corpse was quite modern! - Her cheeks and lips were painted with rouge, her eyebrows were shaved off, her hair was short, and her fingernails and toenails were also dyed. There was also a cloth bag next to her, which contained the powder puff, hair tweezer, and a powder mirror box decorated with feathers that she used during her lifetime, as well as rouge, lipstick, and face powder!

### Each in Their Place

— Rushi

One day, a French traveler in a small village in India suddenly discovered a very exquisitely carved Buddha statue. He asked the antique dealer who was selling the Buddha statue: "How much does it cost?"

He said, "Since you have come from afar, sir, I only want seventy-five rupees."

The traveler said, "Since that's the case, considering that I am a traveler from afar, let's say forty-five rupees.

The shop owner raised his hands to the sky and shouted: "Forty-five rupees! Are you kidding me! Won't others laugh when they hear that?"

The traveler said, "Forty-five rupees, no more.

The shop owner was furious and said: "No way. Since you want this thing, I'd rather give it to you as a gift."

The traveler reached out to take the Buddha statue and said: "I agree! You are really too polite. Thank you very much. However, as the saying goes, courtesy demands reciprocity, so I would also like to give you a small gift now, I hope you won't be angry?"

"Of course not angry!

"Okay, then here is my little gift. It's a total of forty-five rupees, just a token of my appreciation, please accept it."

The shop owner accepted the money, and the two polite gentlemen parted happily.

### Rainy Night

— Diao Ying

The street lights on a rainy night seem to be sparser than usual. So scattered, three or two, dotting a few circles of amber light in the darkness. However, the wet road reflects these lights, but it seems like a winding golden ribbon is laid on the ground.

The people who were crowding by the roadside to enjoy the cool air a few days ago have been driven in by the rain, and the lights in the dormitory have all been turned off.

All that's left is the gentle sound of the rain, only the occasional rustle of my raincoat brushing against the plane tree, and otherwise: a piece of silence.

Suddenly, I saw a small bungalow in the dense flowers and trees, and a hint of light faintly revealed from the light purple curtain. Suddenly, I heard the quiet, slow sound of playing the piano.

Just as the lush green leaves are especially green in the rain, this fragment of piano sound seems to add a lot of beauty to this quiet street.

I gladly took a step. I know: the past is already past, and what should pass must pass. -- However, there is still this kind of helpless attachment, like it's stuck to my heart.

### Snippets of East and West

— Cangyu

In the city of East Kesde in England, there is a glass hotel. The external walls, indoor floors, furniture, and doors and windows are all made of glass of various colors. The walls are also carved with extremely large murals, and the floor is paved with non-slip square patterned glass, arranged into various pleasing patterns. When sunlight shines, the light is reflected from all directions, bright and dazzling, making it a spectacle.

Recently, the Czech Republic invented a kind of "West Long" stockings. This new glass stockings has begun to be sold in Prague, Czech Republic. According to the inventor's wife, she wears them and washes them every day, and a pair of West Long stockings not only doesn't break after being worn for 400 consecutive days, but also doesn't run, which is much more durable than American nylon stockings.

### Talking about Fuqing Pears

— Feng Chaoran

Lu Ziyan followed me in his youth for nearly thirty years. He has fully mastered the arts, but he doesn't flaunt himself. He lives in seclusion in Fuqing Dock in Wukang, opens up land for farming, and plants a thousand pear trees. During the Dingchou Rebellion, his family fled west. Upon victory, he returned from Shu. He looked after his old home, but the house had been reduced to ashes. However, the pear trees he planted long ago had grown tall and spread their canopies, forming a forest that stretched as far as the eye could see. So he weeded the wasteland, loosened the soil, and fertilized it. Within a year, they bore fruit. The pear species are carefully cross-bred, resulting in new and unique varieties. Although the Laiyang and Mashan varieties are famous, they are not accustomed to the southern soil. Moreover, due to the obstruction of Qingxu soldiers, merchants cannot travel, which has caused the taste to be absent from Nanjing for a long time. This then possesses the advantage of possessing the properties of the land, and its excellent quality makes the mouth feel cool and refreshed, and the teeth feel ice-cold, how could it be worse than those from Laiyang and Mashan? In the past, Pan Heyang praised the pears in Zhang Gong's Valley because Zhang Gong was a recluse, so the object was valued because of the person. Now, Yanshao is indifferent to fame and profit, hides his light, builds a house on the green cliff, and works the eastern fields with a hoe. He possesses thousands of wooden slaves [pear trees], similar to the five-colored melons of the marquis, compared to ancient virtuous men, how could he be ashamed? I already admire Yanshao's character, and also believe that the precious and unusual should not be hidden for long, so I write this article to promote it. Those who know the taste should believe that I am not favoring his private interests.

### The Soul of the Awned Meat

The National Assembly of the new Republic of Korea passed the "Punishment of Pro-Japanese Collaborators" Act. Because its history is long and the situation is particularly serious, the first article allows it to be traced back to those who signed the treaties of protection and annexation. Forty years later, the "not very elegant" names of those who destroyed the country reappear, which is lamentable.

During the Jiawu War, although Japan defeated the former Qing, it still promoted the independence of Korea. Moreover, Russia competed with it. Until the end of the Jiachen War, with the Park-Maoji Treaty, Russia recognized all of Japan's special rights. Japan then gradually expanded its voracious mouth. First, Hayashi Gonsuke and the Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the so-called Japan-Korea New Agreement, defining Korea as a "protectorate" and taking away its diplomatic rights. All foreign affairs were handled by Japanese representatives, in order to eliminate its international status. Then, the Governor-General's Office was established, with Ito Hirobumi as the Governor-General, which was actually the same as a supreme government. Later, due to the Hague Secret Envoy Incident, Korea was forced to cede the throne to the crown prince, disband the army, and all military and political power in the country was transferred to Japan, with only a nominal position remaining. Until 1910, with the "petition" of the so-called "Ilgwan Society," the merger was completed. In total, there were four important stages, each stage with its treaty, and each treaty with its signing ministers. At that time, Japan used both coercion and inducement, and it may not have all come from their hearts. Now that the new country has been established, in order to wash away the accumulated shame and blame the past, it cannot but do so. As for who is guilty and what their crime is, we don't need to comment. However, the opposite of "traitor" is "loyal." There are people who are shameless and humiliate the country, and there are also those who resist and sacrifice their lives. Praising loyalty and righteousness and setting an example for the people is not limited to either side.

Liang Rengong had a Korean elegy in the Gengxu year, which said, "Of the ten million Koreans, I see two men. Their livers should be offered in martyrdom, and their spirit of assassinating Qin does not decay." The original note said, "A year before the fall of Korea, the righteous man Ahn Jung-geun assassinated the former Governor-General Ito Hirobumi in Harbin and killed him. He was arrested and calmly faced death. Three days after the fall of Korea, Hong Sang-won, the magistrate of Geumsan County in Chungcheongnam-do, died by self-immolation." According to this, these are the two people that Rengong remembers with particular depth. In fact, there are definitely more than just "two men" among the martyrs who sacrificed their lives throughout the years. For example, during the disbandment of the Seoul army, Park Seong-hwan, the commander of the First Regiment, refused to obey the Japanese order and committed suicide with a pistol. His troops fought a great battle with the Japanese soldiers at the southwest gate, falling one after another, with more than two hundred casualties, and also killing dozens of Japanese generals and soldiers. There are many unknown heroes in this heroic scene. Also, in the Hague Incident, the two Mr. Lis traveled far across the ocean, making "Qin court cries," but crying to no avail, they committed suicide one after another. After Japan annexed Korea, during the restoration movement, there was no lack of zealous and heroic figures who ran around for thirty or forty years. As for Yin Bong-gil, who annihilated the major invaders of China with a single bomb in Shanghai in 1932, Rengong had already passed away and did not see or hear about it.

### "Safety First" Please strengthen traffic control by the police authorities

The streetcar driver deliberately crashes into a tricycle

Dear Editor: Around 7:30 PM on September 2nd, I took the No. 20 streetcar home at the Yu Road Jiangsu Road intersection. When the streetcar approached Yuguang Village on the same road, I suddenly saw a tricycle slowly moving on the sidewalk in front of the streetcar. There were ten passengers on the tricycle. At that time, the streetcar was only about two feet away from the tricycle, but the driver did not brake, but planned to accelerate and pass on the outside. However, because the distance was too close, it crashed straight from behind. The passengers on the tricycle were thrown out more than ten feet, and were crushed by the car a few seconds later. This made me think about the issue of urban traffic safety. Now I have a few suggestions that I would like to discuss with everyone;

(1) For the streetcar company authorities: Streetcar accidents can be said to have left a deep impression on Shanghai citizens. The reasons for this are nothing more than the streetcar drivers' poor skills and lack of training, and the old vehicles. The company authorities should bear 100% responsibility for these points and should pay attention to them anytime and anywhere.

(2) For the public utility authorities: In Shanghai, most drivers of motorized vehicles are only allowed to be hired after passing the public utility bureau's examination. Streetcar drivers should not be an exception, and should be more strictly restricted in the future, so as not to allow those with poor skills to mix in.

(3) For the police authorities: I hope that the safety campaign that was implemented before can be held once every quarter (the time is set for one week). In order to raise the vigilance of drivers, and to strictly enforce the ban on speeding of motor vehicles and the observance of traffic rules. Respectfully, Zhu Yi'wu
