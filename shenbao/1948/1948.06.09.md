### The Control Yuan Will Elect its President Today, With Yu Youren and the People's Party Having the Highest Hopes for Election. Cao Haosen Decides to Compete for Vice President; Zhao Shouyu Has Given Up.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 8th] The Control Yuan's selection of its president by mutual election among the members of the first session is scheduled for the morning of the 9th. Yu Youren, the former president of the Control Yuan, who is considered the most likely candidate for president, registered at the registration office at 11:10 AM on the 8th. It is widely believed that the election of the president can be decided in the first round of voting. The assembly hall for the election has been prepared, and the members will vote in four areas. There will be two ballot boxes, and votes will be counted on the spot. The ballots will be made of folded, letter-size Xuan paper, listing the names of all the members elected and announced by the government. Other procedures will follow the same format as the National Assembly's election of the president. The vote supervisors and vote counters were nominated at the second preparatory meeting on the 8th.

As for those competing for the presidency of the Control Yuan, besides Yu Youren, there is Zhu Wen as the second candidate. The number of candidates for vice president is increasing daily. In addition to Liu Zhe, Tian Jiongjin, Chen Zhaoying, Zhang Weihan, Wang Guanwu, Mei Gongren, Xiao Yishan, Lu Chao, and Cui Dianhua (female), it is reported that Cao Haosen has recently announced his decision to join the race. The candidates are all actively engaging in behind-the-scenes activities for nominations. Zhao Shouyu, who originally intended to compete for the vice presidency, publicly announced his withdrawal at the preparatory meeting on the 8th. His main reason was that there were too many candidates, which would scatter the votes. In order to concentrate opinions and save time, he decided to withdraw from the race. At the same time, he also stated that the requirements for the vice president should be youth and vigor, and he claimed that he did not meet the requirements. He then looked around and bowed to express his gratitude.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 8th] The first session of the Supervisory Committee of the Control Yuan held its second preparatory meeting at 9:15 AM on the 8th, with 122 supervisory committee members in attendance. Liu Zhe chaired the meeting, which passed (1) the draft method for the mutual election of the president and vice president of the Control Yuan; (2) the draft method for voting and counting votes for the mutual election of the president and vice president of the Supervisory Committee; (3) the draft procedures for the election of the president and vice president of the Supervisory Committee; and (4) the duty assignment table for supervisors.

### The Mutual Election Method Was Discussed Item by Item; The Original Plan Was Passed Amidst Heated Debate.

The longest and most heated debate during today's meeting, and also the most important case, was the mutual election method (the original draft can be found in this newspaper on the 7th). First, the chairman asked whether to discuss it item by item or to have a general discussion first. Some people thought that it should be discussed item by item. The first to speak was Zhang Dinghua, who stated that he had participated in the drafting committee on the afternoon of the 7th, but could not fully agree with the draft passed by the drafting committee. He pointed out that the explanation in the first article that all supervisory committee members are natural candidates for mutual election of the president and vice president "is based on the list of elected members announced by the government." Zhang argued that it should be changed to be limited to members who have registered. Then, Hu Wenzhen spoke, saying that supervisory committee members who have been elected should already have the qualifications of supervisory committee members, and their qualifications should not be deprived even if they have not registered. Therefore, even if they have not registered, their eligibility for candidacy should still be retained, and he advocated passing the original draft. Next, Li Zhengle, Chen Fangxian, and others spoke. Wang Guanwu also raised another objection, arguing that since the article had already added a re-election method, the word "re-election" should also be added to the preamble to reflect the actual situation. Tian Jiongjin, in his capacity as chairman of the drafting committee, stood up and explained that the Constitution stipulates mutual election and does not mention re-election, so it should not be hastily included. Secondly, regarding the modification of the regulation on candidates for the mutual election of the president and vice president, limiting it to registered members who are present, it was rejected by an absolute minority of only four votes against thirty-five votes during the vote in the drafting committee. At this point, the chairman announced the vote on the first article, and out of the 122 people present, 67 voted in favor of maintaining the original plan, which was passed by a majority. The second and third articles were passed without objection. In the fourth article, Huang Jue spoke, arguing that in the original article "the election of both the president and vice president should be based on obtaining more than half of the votes of the attendees," the word "both" should be followed by the word "should." Huang was a woman, and was the first female member to speak in the past two days. Her proposal was passed. The fifth article was also slightly modified in wording. The sixth and seventh articles were passed without objection. The eighth article was about the re-election method. Some people proposed a modification, believing that after a proposal by more than a quarter of the members, a majority of the attending members would be sufficient, but after Tian Jiongjin's explanation, the original draft was still passed. After the original nine articles were passed, the subsequent cases were discussed one by one, and all were passed without objection. Finally, Hao Yulin's temporary motion was discussed, and after being amended by Ni Bi: "Open competition, secret ballot, candidates may make a ten-minute campaign speech," but after deliberation, it was rejected by an absolute minority of seventeen votes. The meeting adjourned at 12:10 PM.

### National Representatives Liu Ziya, et al., Advocate for Speedy Currency Reform

### Passing Telegrams of慰問 to Soldiers Fighting Bandits

Telegrams of Condolence to Compatriots in Bandit Areas and Overseas Compatriots

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Legislative Yuan's eighth meeting on the 8th passed three telegrams: telegrams of慰問 to the soldiers fighting bandits on the front lines, telegrams of condolence to compatriots in bandit areas, and telegrams of greeting to overseas compatriots. The telegram to慰問 the soldiers stated: The Communist bandits betray the nation, destroy culture, harm the country, and harm the people. Their crimes are obvious. Even their loudly proclaimed New Democracy is nothing more than deceiving intellectuals, enslaving workers and peasants, and practicing mob dictatorship. Their economic plunder is to support their brutal military attempts to seize power and subvert the government. All of us descendants of the Yellow Emperor, unless we are insane, share the same hatred for the Communists. Our government army bears the great mission of preserving Chinese history and culture, and spares no sacrifice in fighting the Communists in bloody battles. Their loyalty to the country and their courage to save the people are truly moving to the people in the rear. The Legislative Yuan members, who come from the people, can represent the true public opinion. During the first session of the assembly, we, on behalf of 450 million compatriots, extend our sincere慰問 to our loyal and brave soldiers. We hope you will be further encouraged and achieve complete success as soon as possible. The country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate.

### Wu Tiecheng and Chen Bulei Issue a Joint Statement

Hoping that People from the Democratic Youth Party Will Participate in the Two Yuans and the Government

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, and Chen Bulei, Acting Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, recently issued the following statement on the issue of cooperation between the three parties:

Since the war of resistance against Japan, the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party have been of one heart and one mind with our party, working together to overcome national difficulties. For more than ten years, they have always stood firm. This kind of unity is the spirit of the country and the foundation of cooperation between the three parties. Now that the Constitution is being implemented and a constitutional government has been established, in order to make the democratic system healthier, establish a foundation for party politics, and achieve rapid success in quelling the rebellion and building the country, our party has the greatest confidence and sincerity in the continued cooperation of the three parties. Regarding the results of the election of candidates nominated by the two friendly parties as legislators, the number of elected members did not reach the expected quota. The responsible comrades of our party's central committee have repeatedly expressed their apologies. President Chiang has talked with the responsible persons of the two parties and expressed his sincerity. Now, the only thing to do is to try to remedy the situation while taking into account the legal facts, but it will take time. The Legislative Yuan has been in session for a month, and the Control Yuan has also convened. We hope that the legislators and supervisors who have been elected by the two parties will attend as soon as possible to exercise their due powers, so as to make clear the consistent spirit of the three parties. After Dean Weng of the Executive Yuan took office, he invited people from the two parties to shoulder the heavy burden with the greatest sincerity. We sincerely hope that the people of the two parties will inherit the spirit of national planning and resolutely participate, so that the Executive Yuan can achieve the effect of cooperation, and all kinds of important policies can be actively carried out. As for other departments, President Chiang also hopes to recruit people from the two friendly parties and social figures to participate, so as to ensure that there are no regional boundaries and that talents are used to the fullest extent, so that politics can become more substantive and complete. We deeply know that the consistent struggles of the Youth Party and the 민社黨 for many years have been aimed at laying the foundation for the country and establishing a constitutional government. As for the Chinese Nationalist Party, which adheres to the teachings of the Prime Minister, its sincerity in hoping that everyone will work together to complete the building of the country is also well known to society. Since the goals of the three parties are the same, they will be able to comfort the nation with the facts of national unity and hard work under the great righteousness of the nation and the people."

### Expectations for the Legislative Yuan

— Hu Xiansu

This year, on May 20th, the President and Vice President of the Constitutional Government took office, and on the 17th, the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan were elected. Mr. Sun Ke was elected as the President with 558 votes, and Mr. Chen Lifu was elected as the Vice President with 343 votes. On the 24th, the Legislative Yuan formally approved Mr. Weng Wenhao as the Premier of the Executive Yuan. These were the three most important events after the implementation of constitutional government. In his inaugural speech, President Chiang solemnly declared that the constitutional government must strictly abide by the scope prescribed by the law and perform the duties entrusted by the Constitution; must rectify military affairs and strengthen military strength in order to quell the rebellion in the short term; must rectify officialdom, establish discipline, appoint the virtuous and capable, refresh personnel, strictly implement assessments, clarify rewards and punishments, seek the people's grievances, reduce the illegal oppression suffered by local people, and must simplify laws and decrees, clarify responsibilities, unify the implementing agencies, and eliminate complicated and impractical regulations; in terms of economic measures, must implement the Three Principles of the People; to treat the symptoms, effective methods must be used to stabilize the currency value, balance revenue and expenditure, manage finance, improve transportation, so that prices tend to stabilize and the people are free from poverty, and to treat the root causes, land reform must be promoted, the interests of tenant farmers protected, and agricultural land loans expanded to equalize land ownership; a progressive tax rate must be used to levy excessive profits, crack down on speculation and profiteering to control capital; and cooperative enterprises must be promoted, agricultural and industrial production encouraged, legal trade protected, and international investment welcomed. The policy guidelines for the new government put forward by President Chiang are indeed what the people of the country expect. However, under the articles stipulated in the new Constitution, the Legislative Yuan has great power. Not only must all important laws and regulations be legislated by the Legislative Yuan, but after legislation, the Executive Yuan must implement them. Otherwise, the Premier of the Executive Yuan must resign. Therefore, the power of the Legislative Yuan today is far above that of the Tutelage Period. Whether the country's politics are enlightened or not depends on the Legislative Yuan, and the responsibility it bears is even greater than that of the Executive Yuan. Therefore, the people's expectations of the Legislative Yuan are even higher than their expectations of the Executive Yuan.

The most important and urgent task at present is to quell the rebellion. However, the importance of economic pacification is even greater than that of military and political pacification. After eight years of war against Japan and two years of suppressing bandits, the people's livelihood has become extremely depleted. The old and weak die in ditches, and the young and strong, instead of serving in the military, join the communist bandits or gather in the mountains and forests to become bandit gangs. Fields are barren, and disaster victims are everywhere, and in order to fund the suppression of the rebellion, funds are requisitioned, and extortions are endless, which is precisely like driving birds away from the nest, only increasing the source of chaos. Meanwhile, wealthy families and unscrupulous merchants engage in speculation and hoarding, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. In the past, taxation did not extend to the wealthy, and the government has never dared to levy property donations. There are also no effective methods to crack down on speculation and hoarding. Therefore, the primary task of the Legislative Yuan is to pass strict laws and regulations on the levy of property tax and the requisition of deposits held by Chinese nationals abroad, in order to appease public anger and increase financial resources, so as to balance revenue and expenditure and stabilize the currency value. This is one expectation of the Legislative Yuan.

Land reform is an urgent task at present. Those who till the land should own it, which is what the Principle of People's Livelihood advocates. At the same time, the bandit party is using land reform as its political capital. Even local governments such as Guangxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and Fujian have their own single-item land laws and regulations. Under these circumstances, the Legislative Yuan's enactment of land laws is all the more urgent. Either thoroughly enabling those who till the land to own it, or enacting a law limiting land ownership, or adopting the plan proposed by the Land Administration Society, allowing tenant farmers to acquire ownership of the land they till after fourteen years, or issuing land bonds to purchase landlords' land and distribute it to tenant farmers, or widely providing land loans so that tenant farmers can have funds to purchase landlords' land, or limiting the land owned by landlords to a certain limit. Excess land should be nationalized without compensation and redistributed to poor farmers. All of this requires gathering the opinions of experts, careful discussion, and the enactment of laws and regulations. After the laws and regulations are enacted, they must be universally implemented, and at the same time, the single-item laws enacted by local governments must be abolished to seek unification of laws and decrees. What is even more important is that the amount of land limited by the communist bandits and local governments is too low, which is something that all agricultural economists can say. There are many agricultural experts among today's legislators. It is hoped that they can formulate and pass land laws that are suitable for the country's conditions and agricultural economy.

Furthermore, there is something that is equally important to the people's welfare as those who till the land owning it, which is the promotion of cooperative enterprises and the encouragement of agricultural and industrial production that President Chiang has put forward. Agriculture is seasonal, so before agricultural products are harvested, grain prices soar. Poor farmers do not have enough savings and often have to buy food at high prices. And when the harvest is low, farmers are forced to accept high-interest loans or even painfully pre-sell their crops. This kind of exploitation must be thoroughly eliminated, and credit loans and mortgage loans are essential. Although the Farmers Bank is also developing in this area today, the scale of the loans is too small to meet the broad needs of farmers. Economists often say that the cooperative system is the best way to realize socialism. It is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will promptly enact sound laws and regulations in this regard, and expand agricultural loans so that farmers can be freed from the exploitation of high-interest loans and the losses of selling at low prices during the harvest season. Then, increasing the interests of farmers is the way to resolve the revolutionary crisis.

Furthermore, farmers account for more than 80% of the country's population, and under the circumstances of undeveloped industry, the state's revenue largely relies on the taxes paid by farmers. In recent years, the price of tobacco leaves has soared, and the tobacco tax levied by the government accounts for more than 60% of the consumption tax in Shanghai alone. This one example can illustrate the rest. However, how much funding has the government spent to promote the welfare of farmers? In the past, the Executive Yuan did not have a Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Today, the funding for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry accounts for the smallest amount of the national budget. The Central Agricultural Experiment Station has a long history of achievements, but its funding is very limited and it cannot expand its operations to benefit farmers and eliminate harms. To give just one example: it is estimated that about 10,000 heads of cattle die from epidemics in each county of a certain province south of the Yangtze River each year. At today's prices, the loss of cattle deaths nationwide must be an extremely large astronomical figure. Today, the United States has a serum that provides lifelong immunity, and France has invented the ROX drug. If the agricultural improvements of the whole country could be given sufficient funding, and the agency expanded, even preventing cattle epidemics alone would reduce the losses to the country and farmers by an incalculable amount each year. As for water conservancy projects, seed improvement, increased fertilizer, and agricultural product processing, all kinds of agricultural scientific measures can increase national wealth and benefit the people, and the number is almost no less than industrialization, and the cost of the funding must be smaller. The Constitution stipulates that the funding for education, culture, and science must account for 15% of the national budget. Then, for the sake of the welfare of the largest number of people, what percentage of the national budget should the funding for agriculture and forestry account for? Therefore, the Legislative Yuan must increase the funding for agriculture and forestry in all aspects in order to promote the welfare of farmers. This is another expectation of the Legislative Yuan.

Today, there are many virtuous and capable officials in office, but there are also not a few corrupt and incompetent evil officials who abuse the law. The amount of corruption of dignitaries and high-ranking generals is particularly shocking. Rewards and punishments are unclear, and discipline is not established, which has long been ridiculed by people inside and outside the country. The number of redundant personnel is increasing, and the efficiency of government is declining. The government talks about downsizing every day, but the Committee for Suppression of Bandits and National Reconstruction has as many as several thousand redundant personnel who are well-paid and idle. Since the implementation of the new county system, the number of county-level officials has suddenly increased several times, but the county administration is still as lacking as before. How to establish a personnel system, simplify agencies, eliminate redundant personnel to save expenses, how to simplify administrative procedures, and eliminate complicated and impractical laws and regulations to increase administrative efficiency all depend on the legislation of the virtuous. This is the third expectation of the Legislative Yuan.

Education is the foundation of a nation, but China's education system cannot meet the actual needs of the people; compulsory education is particularly lacking in funding and cannot be universally and seriously implemented, so it is impossible to eliminate illiteracy and improve the knowledge level of the general population; higher education is also nominal due to insufficient funding. As a result, the level of education in the country is declining day by day, and it cannot meet the needs of national construction. Although the Constitution stipulates that the funding for education, culture, and science accounts for 15% of the national budget, it has not yet been implemented. Science is the foundation of modern nation-building, and if science cannot catch up, it will not be able to survive in today's world. The Soviet Union, in view of this, has not hesitated to expand scientific research with huge funding. Therefore, in a short period of time, its scientific development has been able to catch up with Britain and the United States and leap into one of the two major powers. China had a scale of scientific research in the ten years before the war. Today, scientific research has fallen into a state of stagnation due to lack of funding. The National Defense Supreme Committee passed a resolution last year stipulating that 1% of the total budget should be allocated as a special fund for scientific research. However, the Directorate General of Budgeting, Accounting and Statistics did not include this expenditure in the budget, and two years have passed without it being implemented. As a result, domestic scientific research cannot progress. How to thoroughly reform the education system in the future, how to fully pay the 15% of the national budget for education stipulated in the Constitution, and how to implement the special fund for scientific research that the National Defense Supreme Council planned to allocate 1% of the total budget to, all depend on legislation. This is the fourth expectation of the Legislative Yuan.

### Zhenjiang Shangdang Coal Mine, Preparing to Resume Mining

[Our newspaper's Zhenjiang dispatch on the 7th] The Donggua Dali and other mountains in the Shangdang district of Zhenjiang contain coal mines.

In the early days of victory, it was destroyed by communist bandits. The Jiangsu Construction Department repeatedly ordered the Jianhua Company, which had previously obtained the mining rights, to resume mining, but no reply was received. Now it has announced the revocation of its mining rights. Recently, it sent technicians Wu Changyou and others to Donggua Mountain, Dali Mountain, Xiaoli Mountain, Pogang Shi, Mashan, the northeast of Baishan, the north of Nishan and Yanshan, and the Zhang Guolao Temple area bordering Xunrong for exploration. Wu returned to Zhenjiang on the 6th. It is reported that the area of this mining area is about 120 hectares, and the daily coal production is about 40 tons.

### Kunming Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Li Shuxia Flies to Chongqing for Treatment, Creating a Good Story. Zhu Shaoliang's Leg Ailment Still Awaits a Miraculous Cure.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 8th] Guan Quanbin, the Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Garrison Command, invited our newspaper reporter today to talk about the miracle of Li Shuxia, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner residing in Kunming. It began with the 79-year-old mother of Peng Bin, the captain of the Second Brigade of the Chongqing Internal Police, who had been ill for a month. From the 5th, she fell into a coma and lost control of her bowels and bladder. Guan telegraphed Li on the 2nd, urgently asking him to fly to Chongqing, without mentioning a word about the symptoms. Li immediately replied to the police, saying that if Peng's mother was under sixty, he could guarantee her safety. Because of old age, the Yang energy must be depleted, and prolonged illness weakens the Qi. The most important thing to avoid is phlegm, because ginseng moistens and helps phlegm. It is the number one "Chinese traitor" among Chinese medicines, so it must be avoided. If a fever has already developed, it is because the isolated Yang is escaping outwards. It is most important to avoid using ice. And Western medicine, nineteen out of ten times, is of the metal and stone Yin nature. Even if the body does not have a fever, it is easy to turn the entire body into a pure Yin state. Therefore, it hinders appetite and even causes abdominal pain and hardness, which is even more so because of the accumulation of Yin evil. Milk and soy milk should be prohibited to avoid what is called gastric stagnation and bladder结. Also, Qi stagnation will make it difficult to defecate, and urination will definitely turn yellow. Enemas must not be performed. The letter included a prescription, but Peng did not dare to use it. After Li arrived in Chongqing from Kunming on the 6th, Peng's mother's pulse was only beating nine times per second. He quickly took out a small package of medicine he had prepared and instructed to purchase top-grade cinnamon and cook it together. On the 7th, he cooked five catties of white Aconitum tuber. This morning, Peng's mother was already able to sit up in bed, smoke a water pipe, and even asked for food. Li is 59 years old. He studied Western medicine in Japan in his early years. Because his three sons were all killed by misdiagnosis from Western medicine, he became interested in traditional Chinese medicine and then studied it in depth. When Li Genyuan formed the cabinet, he served as the Secretary-General. He now has the Gu Fu Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital on Ping'an Street in Kunming. This time, at Guan's invitation to come to Chongqing, thirteen wealthy individuals were willing to charter a plane to come along, but he refused. Currently, there are many long-distance phone calls from Kunming to Chongqing every day. Guan has decided to introduce him to diagnose Director Zhu Shaoliang's leg ailment that has not healed for many years.

### Soviet-Occupied Zone Commander Convenes Advisory Council to Discuss Countermeasures to the German Problem. German People Unanimously Protest the Six-Nation Agreement.

[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] Sources close to the Soviet military government revealed that after the British, American, and French commanders in Germany sent a copy of the London Conference Communiqué to the Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky this morning, Sokolovsky immediately convened his senior advisors to discuss the issue of ending the Four-Power cooperation in Germany. After a day-long meeting, it was decided that the London Conference resolutions had abolished all previous agreements related to Germany, and that future cooperation with the Western powers would come to an end. It is said that the Soviet side's solemn statement in response to the London Communiqué will be released within 24 hours.

[United Press, London, 7th] The Soviet opposition to the agreement on West Germany by the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg was to be expected. The big question now is what actions the Soviet Union will take in East Germany. Even before the Six-Nation Conference, the Soviet Union had vigorously opposed the Six Nations unilaterally resolving the status of West Germany and stated that it would refuse to recognize any resolutions. The first semi-official Communist reaction can be seen in the "Berlin Evening Express," which is approved by the Soviet military. The newspaper declared, "The Western powers know full well that Moscow will not approve of forming a federal government without first seeking the opinion of the German people."

[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] According to investigations, all German parties, even German groups in the West German occupation zones, unanimously oppose the Six-Nation plan for West Germany. The main reason for the opposition is that the Six Nations did not seek German opinion beforehand. Germans are generally afraid that the Soviet Union, in retaliation, will create a permanent division of Germany. The German Social Democratic Party said that the Six-Nation agreement is a method of consolidating political and economic dissatisfaction in Germany.

[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] The Standing Committee of the German People's Congress, sponsored by the Soviet Union, issued a declaration today strongly protesting the suggestions of the London Six-Nation Conference, denouncing it as the first step in dividing Germany. The declaration pointed out that the Six-Nation Communiqué did not mention a single word about a peace treaty. It also stated that after the West German government is established, it will be restricted by the veto power of the Western powers, and the Ruhr region will also be taken from the German economic system and placed under unlimited foreign control in order to use its production capacity for the Western bloc.

### French Cabinet Approves West German Agreement, Heated Debate Expected in Parliament on Friday

[Our Newspaper News] London, 8th Broadcast: Paris dispatch, the French cabinet has approved the Six-Nation agreement concerning West Germany today. The agreement will be submitted to the National Assembly on Friday, and heated debate is expected to occur.

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] French parties have adopted an opposing attitude towards the establishment of a West German constituent assembly and the international control of the Ruhr plan decided at the London Six-Nation Conference. Schumann's government is feeling threatened as a result. Deputies who usually support the government also believe that the West German policy suggested by the Six-Nation Conference is deeply shocking. The National Assembly is scheduled to debate this matter this Friday, and the National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a discussion this Wednesday. If Foreign Minister Bidault cannot alleviate the Assembly's fears and eliminate its criticism at that time, the government will inevitably fall into a precarious position due to the lack of an absolute majority in the National Assembly to support it. Among the parties, apart from the Communist Party and the Gaullist Party, which have already expressed opposition, centrist leader René Pleven and some key members of the People's Republican Movement are also still suspicious. The main reason for the opposition is that the Ruhr production control plan suggested by the Six-Nation Conference is insufficient to adequately protect France's interests. France fears that France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will be swayed by the opinions of the British, American, and German representatives, and may even allow Germany to gain a pivotal position among the British, Americans, and continental European countries. It is expected that Bidault's argument will state that the Six-Nation Conference's suggestion is part of an overall Western foreign policy, and that the Marshall Plan and the Western European Union are also part of that foreign policy. It is impossible to accept one part of the policy and reject the rest.

### Czech Republic Builds Defenses on the German Border

### The Most Meaningful Aspect of the West German Agreement is the Elimination of the Veto Power

[United Press, Berlin, 8th] The military government believes that the most meaningful aspect of the new agreement on Germany by the Western powers is the elimination of the veto power. International co-management of the Ruhr has been the most difficult problem to solve in postwar Germany. The agreement now states that the international structure will be decided by a majority vote, and that the institution will be authorized by a majority to investigate whether the German government is not fulfilling its obligations in the Ruhr region. According to one source, the international institution in the Ruhr region should at least be a working group. The Soviet Union has often used its veto power on the entire German question, obstructing the four-nation resolution, just as it does in the United Nations Security Council, thus rendering the function of the Allied Control Council into a Soviet propaganda machine.

### International Socialist Congress Passes Resolution

Hoping the Four Powers Seek Cooperation to Prevent Germany from Falling into Division

[Reuters, Vienna, 7th] The International Socialist Congress, held here, passed a resolution on the 7th, expressing hope that the four occupying powers of Germany can find a common solution to prevent the division of Germany, that is, of Europe. The Congress also decided to establish a committee to examine the Ruhr issue. Fourteen countries voted in favor of the resolution, with only Luxembourg abstaining. The resolution stated: (Above omitted) Although the Congress does not yet know the full content of the Six-Nation Conference agreement on the Ruhr, upon hearing the news that an agreement has been reached, it believes that it is indeed a practical step towards a unified front. The Congress demands that the organization and powers of each international control commission in the Ruhr area must be able to guarantee the implementation of the principles of European security and its restoration. The principal of this believes that if the German people decide to approve the proposal made by the German Social Democratic Party to make the main industries in the Ruhr public, it will be of great assistance to European peace and welfare. Under no circumstances can these industries be allowed to become the private property of capitalists in any one country. After studying the Ruhr issue, this conference is even more convinced that there is a need to hand over the main position of European economic power to international control. Therefore, this conference has established a committee to continue to examine this issue and submit a report to the next conference.

### The World Hovers at a Crossroads, Future Masters Should Know What to Choose, Gu Weijun Delivers a Speech

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the United States, said in a speech at the Miami University graduation ceremony today that the world today is hovering at a crossroads. The future of the world and the path of civilization itself all depend on the choice of today's youth between democratic systems and communist authoritarian systems. When discussing the current international situation, Gu also emphasized that "China is the most important battlefield for dealing with communism. International communist leaders have indeed recognized that Asia will eventually be a most important region." Gu also said: The attention of democratic forces is currently focused on Europe, with little regard for the situation in the Far East, but "the leaders of world communism, while deliberately pretending on the surface to focus their attention on Europe, have in fact already placed their biggest bet in Asia."

### Soviet Union Plans to Send Personnel to Supervise the Truce in the Holy Land, the United Nations Feels Surprised, It Will Be Known Today Whether Jews and Arabs are Willing to Ceasefire

[Our Newspaper News] London, 8th Broadcast: Cairo dispatch, United Nations Palestine mediator Bernadotte, regarding the Soviet Union's willingness to participate in supervising the truce in the Holy Land, said: It is still uncertain whether the ceasefire can be achieved at present. If the ceasefire is achieved, many observers will be needed. I believe that everything should be based on needs, and the selection of personnel should be based on a physical and neutral attitude.

[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] Soviet representative Gromyko today publicly expressed for the first time in the United Nations Security Council his desire to send military observers to Palestine. It is said that the three council members of the United States, France, and Belgium have been invited to provide observers, and the Soviet government also intends to send personnel to participate. This move has made public for the first time the internal situation that has been bothering several countries since the Palestine problem arose, that is, whether the United Nations organization can force a truce in Palestine without introducing communist troops. After listening to the speech, the representatives were very surprised and immediately suspended the discussion to ask their governments for instructions. The case will not be discussed until at least the afternoon of the 10th.

At the same time, the Security Council received a report from Bernadotte, the mediator of the Holy Land conflict, saying that he hoped to report to the Security Council on the 9th whether the attempt to broker a four-week truce between the Jewish and Arab sides would succeed. Gromyko also said that the Security Council had not specified the method for selecting military observers, and that the Soviet government found it difficult to accept the theory that the United States, France, and Belgium had the right to send observers simply because they participated in the mediation committee.

[Reuters, London, 8th] The Arab countries' response to the Security Council's suggestion for a four-week truce in the Holy Land will be submitted to United Nations mediator Bernadotte in Cairo on the 9th. According to Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi, the Arab leaders are considering the compromise proposal that the Jews have already accepted regarding the issue of immigration during the truce and the issue of providing supplies to the Jews in the Jerusalem area. These two points are the crux of the ceasefire negotiations. Regarding the first point, the Jewish side has agreed that Bernadotte will supervise Jewish immigrants of conscription age during the truce to prevent them from becoming combat units. Regarding the first point, the Jewish side has accepted the suggestion of the Red Cross, which will be responsible for providing supplies to the 100,000 Jews in Jerusalem during the truce.

[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 8th] The Israeli government's response to the truce conditions submitted by United Nations mediator Bernadotte has not yet been decided.

### The International Situation Approaches a Delicate Stage: The American People Should Remain Calm; Marshall Feels That Striving for Peace is Not Easy

[Agence France-Presse, Cape Fear, North Carolina, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall, speaking at the University of North Carolina, stated that the international situation has reached "a delicate stage of whether negotiations can be reopened, or whether it will fall into a complete deadlock," to the extent that it cannot be openly discussed. Marshall stressed the difficulty of achieving peace, saying, "Commanding a war is actually simpler than handling international issues and striving for peace today." The American people should have the determination to make long-term plans and not be limited to temporary gains and losses.

[United Press, Cape Fear, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall attended the graduation ceremony of North Carolina State University on the 7th and delivered a speech, emphasizing that in the current complex international situation, capable diplomats are increasingly rare. Marshall expressed his admiration for Lappham (head of the aid to China mission), Hoffman (executor of the Marshall Plan), Graham (president of the university, former chairman of the UN Indonesia Truce Commission), and others. Marshall stated that the complex disputes and volatile situations around the world are increasing the responsibilities of the United Nations, and American diplomatic representatives, in particular, must possess outstanding abilities and extensive experience. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to find individuals who can adequately represent American interests. The easily excitable nature of the general American public also makes it difficult for the government to implement far-reaching foreign policies. Marshall continued, stating that there are two main reasons why long-term foreign policies are difficult to implement. First, the American people are prone to emotional excitement, which is quite dangerous in matters of foreign relations. On the other hand, we must also admit that unless such emotional interest is first generated, general interest is not easily aroused, and necessary political action cannot be obtained. We are a "young country," and the people are energetic and known for their love of individual freedom. In diplomatic affairs, we should adopt a cautious and thorough approach, focusing on the long-term future rather than short-term results.

### Mayor Opens His Purse to Lead, Yet No One Responds; Difficulty in Collecting Special Donations; Committee Discusses Countermeasures; Commissioners Will Personally Solicit When Necessary

The matter of collecting special donations for relief in the Shanghai area was previously decided to be based on the principle of voluntary donations. Mayor Wu took the lead by generously donating 500 million yuan as an example. However, to date, not a single wealthy family or philanthropist has followed suit, which has truly embarrassed the authorities and saddened the poor. In view of this, the Special Relief Donation Collection Committee held a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 8th to discuss new fundraising strategies, hoping to complete its mission as soon as possible. It is learned that the consensus reached at the meeting was that, when necessary, the commissioners will personally solicit donations from celebrities, business owners, and trade associations throughout the Shanghai area.

[Another Report] Mayor Wu, concurrently head of the Special Relief Donation Fundraising Committee, convened senior city government officials and heads of various bureaus and departments in the city hall conference room yesterday afternoon to discuss methods for each bureau to be responsible for soliciting donations from various trade associations and fellow-villagers associations. It was agreed that each bureau would dispatch three supervisors, carrying official letters from the fundraising committee, to be responsible for promoting fundraising among the fundraising targets independently identified by each bureau and relevant units. Meetings will be convened separately by each unit by the 15th to produce a list of voluntary donors and the amount they are donating, to be concluded by the end of this month. It is expected that the full amount can be donated as planned. The fellow-villagers associations and trade associations identified by each bureau to be responsible for fundraising are as follows: 35 units for the Social Affairs Bureau, 32 units for the Police Bureau, 22 units for the Finance Bureau, 19 units for the Civil Affairs Bureau, 11 units for the Public Utilities Bureau, 10 units for the Public Works Bureau, 14 units for the Health Bureau, 16 units for the Land Administration Bureau, 8 units for the Education Bureau, 2 units for the Press Office, 7 units for the Statistics Office, and 1 unit for the Accounting Office, totaling over 170 units. However, in reality, there are over 300 trade associations and fellow-villagers associations in the city. The city government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to supplement the missing units for further review. As for the special donations raised this time, they have been approved by the President for the organization of a garrison brigade.

In order to balance revenue and expenditure costs, the industry firmly demanded that oil must be exchanged at the National Bank's official rate; otherwise, even with recent adjustments to freight rates, they still feel that revenue is insufficient and difficult to maintain.

### Lessees of Enemy and Puppet Properties Request Rent Reduction Due to Unaffordable Burden

The standard for housing rent in this city was previously proposed by the Municipal Council and approved by the Municipal Government Conference, stipulating that the maximum rent for commercial properties is 9,000 times the pre-war rent, and the maximum rent for residential properties is 7,000 times the pre-war rent. However, the Central Trust Bureau recently collected "usage fees" for January and March of this year from lessees of enemy properties and shopfronts, calculated as 17 times higher than the end of December of the previous year, far exceeding the legally stipulated rent standard. The lessees believe that the burden is unaffordable and previously petitioned the bureau's Dongxing branch for a reduction. Subsequently, the bureau's Real Estate Department replied that the above standard for adjusting usage fees was approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region and implemented after being resolved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee. The request for a reduction was not approved. Lessees Yang Yongnian, Gan Houyun, and 43 other households submitted another petition to the Municipal Council yesterday, requesting that it inform the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region to respect the council's proposal and reduce rent to alleviate the difficulties of merchants.

### Military Organs and Troops Must Not Forcibly Rent Civilian Houses; Use Existing Barracks and Public Buildings as Much as Possible

[Our Newspaper] The methods for military organs and troops to rent civilian houses and the methods for National Army troops to billet during transit have been revised by the Executive Yuan. The Municipal Government received instructions yesterday and ordered the Police and Civil Affairs Bureaus to comply. The main points of the two methods are as follows:

Main points of the methods for military organs and troops to rent civilian houses: (1) Housing for various military organs and troops should primarily utilize existing barracks and public buildings or self-construction. Requisitioning is prohibited. If there are no barracks or public buildings available for allocation and construction funds are unavailable, civilian houses may be rented. (2) Renting civilian houses should first obtain the consent of the homeowner. Forced occupation is prohibited. If finding civilian houses to rent is difficult, the local government may be consulted to help find them. House rent should be handled according to the standard price set by the local government. If there is no regulation, the local government may be asked to estimate the price. Arbitrary pricing is prohibited. (3) The lease contract should be signed by both parties and certified by the local government.

Main points of the methods for National Army troops to billet: Major cities should have reception centers set up by local military supply agencies, utilizing existing barracks or public buildings as much as possible to allocate accommodation for troops in transit. If there are no barracks or public buildings available or if they are insufficient, camping or setting up tents for accommodation should be carried out to the extent that weather and equipment permit. If there are no public buildings or tents available, the reception center should consult with the local government or township office to find civilian houses. All troops are strictly prohibited from occupying them on their own.

### Owners of Land Requisitioned for Airport Request Land Price Payment

After the victory, the landowners requested the Land Administration Bureau to clear the land.

It is hoped that it can be resolved soon.

Li Baiqing to be Prosecuted in Court Today

[Our Newspaper] Li Shizeng, Chairman of the Hebei Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, stating that the association member Yan Jiazhu's landlord, Li Baiqing, led a crowd to commit violence, which was verified after investigation. He requested that justice be upheld. The letter stated: Member Yan Jiazhu's house at No. 25, Yuxing Lane, Liyang Road, 3rd floor, landlord Li Baiqing intended to take back, but Yan was unwilling to move.

### Tenants of Changji Lane Pay Rent in Rice; Tenants Request Land Bureau to Stop It

[Our Newspaper] Sun Jinfal, Zhou Renjie, and over 40 other tenant households in Changji Lane, Fuxing East Road, Nanshi, jointly submitted a letter to the Land Administration Bureau a few days ago, stating that the head landlord, Junye Company, has repeatedly increased rent, tripling it since January of this year. The second landlord has also increased rent to the third tenants, and starting next month, rent will be calculated in rice, so the burden on the third tenants is very heavy. Therefore, they appealed to the Land Administration Bureau to thoroughly investigate and stop it. Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau has ordered a response. According to a responsible person, "The profits of the second landlord should be in accordance with the provisions of Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Housing Rental Regulations. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate whether the second landlord is violating the Rental Regulations and investigate whether the rent collected by the head landlord exceeds 7,000 times the pre-war rent."

### Evidence of the Difficulties of Public Transportation Companies; 300,000 Daily Passengers on Each Line; 40 Percent Without Tickets

[Our Newspaper] According to recent statistics from the city's Public Transportation Company, passengers without tickets on each line account for more than one-third of the total traffic volume, resulting in a huge monthly loss of 60 to 70 billion yuan in expected operating revenue. When the company was first established, it was determined to eradicate the practice of military and police riding without tickets, but the implementation was fraught with difficulties and often led to disputes. Later, the company authorities, in view of the actual situation, had to change their original intention and comply with "custom." However, if this continues, the company's business development will be greatly hindered and will accelerate the cyclical increase in ticket prices, increasing the burden on citizens. The company's research committee has specially established a traffic volume observation group for this purpose, hiring more than a dozen observers to station at important military stations on various lines to count passengers boarding and alighting. This work has continued for more than three months, and materials have been collected from ticket sellers, ticket inspectors, and other persuaders to compile a comparison table of the total number of passengers and the number of passengers with tickets. The basis for this is the average daily figures over the past three months for the 250-odd buses of the company operating on 15 lines throughout the city: (1) The number of passengers buying tickets on the route is 200,527. (2) The number of passengers holding monthly tickets is 11,296. (3) The number of passengers actually observed is 300,626. Subtracting the number of passengers buying tickets on the route and those holding monthly tickets from the number of passengers actually observed, the difference (the number of passengers without tickets) accounts for 41.9 percent of the total number. (This includes the navy, army, air force, combined transport, military police, police, company employees or employees of the same industry, and a small amount of omissions.) Military personnel account for more than 33 percent. It is also heard that the situations on the transportation lines belonging to the British Tramway Company and the French Water and Electricity Company are similar, and those companies are also conducting statistics. The government authorities also attach great importance to the issue of military personnel riding without tickets and will find ways to improve it.

### How Deeply are the Stone Figures Misleading? - Someone Actually Writes to the Police Bureau - Willing to Build a Temple for Worship at Own Expense

[Our Newspaper] Even after the plaque of the stone figures was removed, pious men and women still went to burn incense and worship. The police officers stationed there tried their best to dissuade them, but their efforts were futile. The day before yesterday, someone even hung up two plaques with the words "Answers All Prayers." These plaques were removed again yesterday. The police bureau also received a letter yesterday from a woman named "Xu Ya," requesting permission to move the stone figures to a suitable location at her own expense and build a temple for public worship. Her submission contained a remarkable passage: "Upon investigation, Buddhism has been in our country for thousands of years and has endured for a long time. This is a matter of religion and should not be abolished abruptly. To maintain the dignity of Buddhism, improve the appearance of the city, and facilitate traffic, the best of both worlds is to relocate to a suitable building. This would provide a place for devout citizens to worship and also achieve the goals of improving appearances." According to the address provided at the end of the letter, 76 Lane, 12 Baker Road, the reporter went to investigate yesterday afternoon. The address is a law firm owned by Shen Ronghua. At the time, people were playing mahjong in the reception room. When asked if there was a person named Xu Ya, they all said they did not know.

### Only a Thousand or So Japanese Remaining in Shanghai - Stable Life, No Desire to Return - Housing Problems Are the Most Distressing

[Our Newspaper] According to sources in the relevant departments, after the victory, the number of Japanese who remained in the city, after being repatriated successively, as of now, there are still 1,011 people remaining. (Including 40 women who married Chinese men and 73 women who married Chinese men.) Among them, 445 people actually participate in the work of retained agencies, and the rest are family members. They have a "Japanese Liaison Office" in Yifeng Lane, Wusong Road, responsible for conveying all orders from the Shanghai Police Headquarters' Japanese Management Section. Among the retained institutions, the textile industry has the most, accounting for about one-third of the retained Japanese. These technicians have generous treatment and a stable life, so even some have surplus funds for savings. Others are engaged in the work of machinery, fishing, and other institutions. Most of these thousand or so Japanese had lived in the city before the war, the longest having a history of fifty years, and the average being around twenty years. They are addicted to Shanghai and have no desire to return to their homeland. Communication with their home country is very convenient, but all incoming and outgoing mail must be carefully checked by the Police Bureau's Japanese Management Section. The most distressing thing for them now is that housing disputes occur frequently. Although the housing allocation is handled by the municipal government, some people in certain institutions still rely on force to seize enemy property houses managed by the Central Trust Bureau that are occupied by Japanese. If the authorities intervene slightly, they are often blamed by those people for not protecting the Japanese, making those who deal with such disputes feel very difficult. Regarding the claim that Taiwanese or Koreans are hiding in the city as Japanese, after a thorough investigation by the police bureau, it is said that the number is very small, and they have all been arrested and brought to justice.

### Seeking to Regulate Military Life - Racing to Build Mobile Service Vehicles - Painting Maitreya Buddha - Inscribing "Everyone Rejoices" - Huang Renlin Talks About the Military Recreation Program

[Our Newspaper] The reporter visited General Huang Renlin at the Lizhi Society yesterday to discuss the issue of military recreation in detail. Mr. Huang recently served as Deputy Commander of the Joint Operations Headquarters and Director of the Special Service Department. These were established on April 19th of this year, specializing in the recreation and welfare of the troops. The significance of the establishment is twofold: to boost morale and to enliven the mood of the military. Mr. Huang mentioned that recent incidents of military personnel causing disputes while watching plays in the city were regrettable. He also said: The Special Service Department should be responsible for this.

To actively promote the military recreation program, the Department recently consulted with 29 domestic film manufacturers in the city and plans to borrow the original films of each film manufacturer and reduce them into 16mm versions for military entertainment screenings, with the principle of not hindering the film manufacturers' business. Each film manufacturer expressed great sympathy. Luo Xuelian of China Film Co. was the first to accept, but this has not completely solved the difficulties. The production of reduced versions takes a long time, and screening venues are also yet to be found. For a more permanent solution,

Trial Assembly of Four Vehicles to be Completed by the End of the Month

Due to the high mobility of this vehicle, in addition to major cities, it can also penetrate into the various bandit suppression areas of the country to serve the troops, thereby regulating military life. The first batch of vehicles is planned to be 40 vehicles. Four are currently being assembled for trial use and are expected to be completed before the end of the month.

Technical Personnel Intensifying Training

The reporter obtained a draft design yesterday. The vehicle is a converted universal passenger car. The interior is equipped with various recreational equipment. The vehicle body is painted with a large Maitreya Buddha image, with five soldiers laughing and holding hands around the Maitreya Buddha. Below is inscribed "Everyone Rejoices." Mr. Huang said: This is the slogan of the Special Service Department. According to reports, the U.S. military has a Special Service organization that serves with the army and has achieved remarkable results. The establishment of the Special Service Department is modeled after this, and it is still in its infancy. Therefore, there is a great shortage of technical personnel. To intensify training, a Special Service School has been established on Shuidao Road in the city. One hundred students above the rank of general will be drawn from various units to intensify training in the required subjects. The first phase will start on June 1st and officially open on June 14th. After graduating in six months, they will be assigned to travel with the vehicles to provide services.

### Designated Bank Subcommittee Meeting - Discusses the Absorption of Overseas Remittances - Still Handled in Accordance with Circular No. 134

[Our Newspaper] The issue of absorbing overseas remittances was discussed by the designated bank foreign exchange subcommittee. Due to too many technical difficulties, no concrete results were achieved. The designated banks are now temporarily handling it in accordance with the provisions of Circular No. 134, that is, for overseas remittances, the Central Bank will issue a special foreign exchange settlement certificate, and then the designated bank will sell it on behalf of the payee at the market price, and hand over the sum of the market price and the official exchange rate to the payee. Yesterday, the market price of the foreign exchange settlement certificate was around 400,000 yuan, and the total with the official exchange rate was 874,000 yuan, which is still far from the black market price. Therefore, the outside world believes that the new foreign exchange settlement system can stimulate exports, but it may be difficult to succeed in absorbing overseas remittances.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise in North and South Cities - But the Trend is Slightly More Moderate Than the Previous Day

The rice market continued the upward trend of the previous day at the opening yesterday, seeing further gains. Due to loose monetary conditions and high tin prices, coupled with a reduction in arrivals, cargo owners were able to raise prices more easily. The morning market saw a rise of 300,000 yuan, and the asking price for white japonica rice once approached 8 million. However, the market was hesitant due to the high price, and increased selling as prices rose, so it turned downwards after opening. The North City market closed with white japonica rice at 7.8 million. Early season indica rice and other varieties rose by 150,000 or 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The extra high quality japonica rice market also saw high prices followed by lower prices, and ultimately a slight increase of 50,000 yuan. However, high-quality white glutinous rice has reached the 8 million mark. Arrivals in the two markets were registered at 4,796 dan.

Flour The early market was tight for a while, rising by 100,000 yuan, but after a brief surge, it fell back. Old Che flour opened at a high price of 2.45 million, but then news spread that the Central Trust Bureau had resumed selling flour, and selling increased sharply. Old Army flour retreated to 2.35 million at closing, while "Warship" flour retreated to 2.33 million yuan, all to break even. "Red Bee" and "Jiancheng" flour fell by 20,000 yuan.

### Northeastern Athletes Want to Return But Cannot; Dongxing Basketball Team Established; Announcement of the Establishment Process Is Moving; Will Go to Various Places to Perform to Awaken the People of the Country

Another new star has emerged in the city's basketball scene. The Dongxing Basketball Team was officially announced yesterday. The team is based on the northeastern elite team "Northeast Wind" and is joined by basketball players from Jilin, Harbin and other provinces and cities. The "Northeast Wind" is the champion of North China and represented Shenyang City in the previous National Games. It also achieved the great feat of winning ten consecutive victories in Pingjin last year. Its skills are pure and its strength is abundant. In this National Games, the team represented Shenyang City. When they went south, they went through hardships. When the conference ended, the hometowns of the team members had been captured by bandits, and they had no way to return. Therefore, Wang Yongfang, Zhang Pu, Tian Fuhai, Wei Qikun, Meng Xiancheng, Bai Chunyu and others initiated and were assisted by Yao Zhizhong, Wei Zhenkui, and Wang Lan to decide to organize the Dongxing Basketball Team to encourage training and then go to various parts of the country to conduct friendly matches to awaken the people of the country to pay attention to the current situation in the Northeast.

### East Star Public Announcement

This team, in order to briefly express its purpose, issues a public announcement stating: "Since the victory, the Northeast, which had been沦陷 for fourteen years, has returned to the embrace of the motherland. Just as we celebrated the 光复, we suffered again from the 赤祸. Black waters and white mountains are shrouded in battle clouds. Fertile plains are strewn with skeletons. Industry and commerce are destroyed by artillery fire, and rural areas are devastated by the smoke of war. The people groan under violence and licentiousness, stretching their necks and waiting for deliverance. Although the 戡乱 army has risen, opening a glimmer of hope, the flames of rebellion still rage, awaiting the concerted efforts of all.

"Upon investigation, the Northeast athletes at this All-China Games, braving dangers, either escaped from the occupied Jilin or broke through the encirclement of Changchun, carrying their luggage on their shoulders and walking thousands of miles. Their faces were covered in dirt, and they disguised themselves as merchants or mingled with beggars. Across countless mountains and passes, their hands and feet were calloused. They slept under the stars and moon, and walked in the wind and snow. Sometimes they were detained by the bandit army, and their lips were parched. Sometimes they were coveted by roaming bandits, and their baggage was emptied. After weeks and months, they finally arrived in Shenyang, starving and freezing. Amidst the choking sobs of the elders, they gathered the athletes and flew south with heavy hearts.

"However, the athletes, having endured hardship and danger to participate in the National Games, did not come merely to demonstrate their skills and win banners. They truly wish to use their strong bodies to show the people of the nation that, although the youth of the Northeast are in dire straits, their blood still boils, and they are willing to give their all for the motherland. Now that the All-China Games have ended, and the flames of war in the Northeast are still raging, most of the athletes' hometowns have fallen into bandit areas, and their wives and children are separated and have no way to contact them. They cry out to the heavens, wanting to return but having no way to do so. Therefore, they have gathered more than ten basketball players and formed a basketball team, named East Star. After careful planning, they plan to go to various places at home and abroad to hold friendly matches, so that the current situation in the Northeast will always resonate in the minds of the people of the nation, to promote sincere unity and complete the great cause of 戡乱 and nation-building. However, since each team member escaped danger alone and has no funds, we would like to ask all officials and sports-loving gentlemen to provide financial assistance so that this Northeast basketball team, which has wandered thousands of miles, can develop in Shanghai. This would be a meaningful and delightful undertaking."

### World Games Delegation to Depart in Three Batches

Regarding the transportation arrangements for our World Games delegation, the China National Aviation Corporation has offered preferential treatment, as reported yesterday. However, some newspapers have reported that the World Games delegation did not accept the preferential treatment offered by CNAC. This is not true. The World Games delegation issues the following statement:

"Our country's delegation to the World Games will depart in three batches. (1) The 20-member soccer team departed at the end of April, traveling through various ports in Southeast Asia and India, playing matches along the way, and then heading to England. (2) The approximately 15-member basketball team is currently training in Beijing, preparing to fly from Shanghai to the Philippines on CNAC planes at the end of this month, and then transfer to other planes to travel through Singapore to England. (3) The remaining delegates, due to their duties, are scheduled to depart from Shanghai in early July, traveling through the United States to England. The above itineraries have been decided long ago, and the China Travel Service and Thomas Cook have been entrusted to handle the booking procedures. It has also been agreed that all athletes will return home on CNAC planes from Calcutta, India. The reports in some newspapers that our delegation did not accept the preferential treatment offered by CNAC are inconsistent with the facts. We are deeply concerned that this will cause misunderstandings in the outside world, and we hereby issue this announcement."

### Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon

— Yan Zhewu

— Sending Yu Shangyuan as a Representative to Attend the International Theatre Conference

The International Theatre Institute, whose purpose is to "promote mutual understanding between nations," was proposed by Mr. Priestley and other members of the Literature and Art Group at the first General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in November 1946. They wanted to discuss a "concrete plan to safeguard peace from an artistic standpoint," believing that "theatre is the most powerful cultural education and guidance tool among the vast masses of the world." Therefore, it should cooperate closely with the international theatre community, regularly convene meetings of international theatre experts, and organize an International Theatre Institute. As a result, at the 1947 meeting, it was decided to hold a meeting in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in May 1948. A temporary executive committee of the International Theatre Institute was first established to prepare for the meeting. At the same time, letters were sent to the Chinese theatre community, hoping that a branch organization would be established in the Far East and that a formal representative would be sent to attend the first International Theatre Conference. - This conference was rescheduled to be held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on June 28 of this year.

On the Chinese side, due to the urging of Mr. Huxley, Mr. Kuerz, and others, we established the Chinese branch of the International Theatre Institute and elected the attending representative - that is, the chairman of the branch, Mr. Yu Shangyuan.

Mr. Yu will fly from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 11th, then to the UK, and then to the Czech Republic to attend the conference. As Representative Yu is about to depart, we will send him our deepest hopes -

1. We hope that our representative will collect as much material as possible on the historical traces of the Chinese theatre community's arduous struggles and glorious sacrifices during the Anti-Japanese War and after the restoration, and present them to theatre friends all over the world. We also hope to accuse the Japanese fascist bandits of persecuting the Chinese theatre community!

2. We hope that our representative will report on the improvement and progress of the performance standards of Chinese spoken drama. It is clear that our theatrical art has made rapid progress in the past decade and has caught up with countries such as England, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. We should let international theatre friends know the results of our arduous struggle!

3. We hope that our representative will explain the plight of the Chinese theatre community, which has been forced into a low ebb due to the impact of the war. Because one of the tasks of the International Theatre Conference is to "assist the theatre industries of war-torn countries," we do not necessarily need material help, but we would like to receive more sincere "spiritual assistance" from the international theatre community!

4. More importantly, we hope that the representative conference of the International Theatre Institute will have practical and noble achievements, find a true plan to safeguard international peace with artistic power, and hope that our representative can bring back new treasures to save the current crisis of the Chinese theatre movement by borrowing the experience of others.

5. Finally, we hope that the film "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," directed by Mr. Shi Dongshan, which records the arduous work of Chinese theatre workers during the Anti-Japanese War, can be transported to Prague and screened during the International Theatre Conference so that international theatre friends can have a more concrete understanding of the difficult living conditions of our theatre friends! (Shanghai, June 7)

### Centipede

— Li Zi

"It's a disgrace to scholarship that a dignified principal would be so untrustworthy!" Old Mr. Fan's sandy voice burst into the office again. His body swayed, his hands still clasped behind his back, the veins on his forehead bulging, his eyes wide open. Without even taking the time to see what people were writing, (he always lingered by each person's desk whenever he came into the office, looking at what people were writing, even personal letters), (spitting everywhere, he shouted, "Payday was four days ago, and no one's seen a penny yet! We have to argue with reason! Otherwise, we'll really be at their mercy!"

Everyone in the office remained at their "posts": crocheting yarn, marking papers, and even Little Lu kept humming his tune. Two or three students lingered far away outside the window, whispering to each other, but they didn't dare come closer because of the "iron face" of the dean of students.

It's no exaggeration to say that Mr. Fan was old. He's almost seventy this year. In the late Qing Dynasty, he was even a "supplementary student" (but people called him a "scholar"). He's been teaching at this middle school for thirty years and nine months. But he doesn't think he's old. He grew a few long eyebrows when he was sixty, and he says he's lived to be seventy because of these "longevity eyebrows." He eats four bowls of rice at every meal, his eyes and teeth are all good, and his sandy voice can be heard throughout the school when he teaches. He teaches twenty-four hours a week, Chinese and history to three junior high classes each, and he doesn't even give up the two hours of foreign history. Fortunately, he's old and always has notes prepared for class. Who can deny it when he gives a lecture on "The Anglo-Saxons as descendants of the Chu people?" He's going to leave? Ha! Mr. Fan has been teaching here for longer than the age of two students combined.

The principal has even more reasons for not paying salaries: He has a toothache and doesn't come to school, so no pay; his son has a stomachache and is busy seeing a doctor, so no pay; it's raining and he can't get a rickshaw to school, so no pay; he was tired from attending some party yesterday and is taking a day off, so no pay; the bank is only open for half a day on Saturday and he doesn't have time to get the money, so no pay; of course, there's no pay on Sunday; on Monday, he has to go to the chairman of the board's office on business, so no pay… Anyway, most of the teachers are "relatives of the emperor" – the director of teaching affairs is his uncle, the dean of students is his nephew, the director of general affairs is his nephew, and the accountant is his godson… No one dares to speak up, but Mr. Fan often sings a different tune. So every time, they have to appease him first to avoid "trouble." This time, they forgot somehow. Mr. Fan would scold female students for wearing short socks, saying, "The world is going downhill!" How much more so when salaries are deducted, which goes against the way of the sages and shows disrespect to Mr. Fan? Wouldn't that enrage him?

Even if Mr. Fan raged like thunder, no one could stop him. After all, Little Lu joked, "Well, Mr. Fan, you're so virtuous and respected, you could really stand up to him."

"Me?" Mr. Fan was surprised. "Heh, if I were thirty years younger and had a little more fire, I'd give him a piece of my mind!" As he said this, he walked away with his hands behind his back.

The office erupted in laughter as they saw him out.

Actually, Mr. Fan didn't used to be this angry, especially during the five and a half years when he was the director of general affairs. Except for occasionally stomping his feet and scolding the school workers, he always smiled at students, colleagues, and especially the principal, and never got angry. He could take any insults. But ever since that nephew of his, the director of general affairs, followed the principal into office, his temper has gotten worse: If chalk scratches the blackboard, it's the director of general affairs' fault; if there's sand in the rice, what's the general affairs office doing? If teachers have to pay extra for rickshaw fare for their rice ration, that's outrageous! If a desk tears their clothes, the general affairs office has to pay for it; if the color of the textbook is too light, it must be the director of general affairs colluding to cut corners… It never ends. And every time, he always curses loudly, starting with the fact that the director of general affairs' father was a cart driver and a peddler, and continuing until it's a disgrace to scholarship and a harm to his descendants.

Just as one storm had subsided, another one came along half a day later. By chance, a big centipede was found on the female teachers' table during lunch, causing them to scream shrilly. This gave Mr. Fan an even better topic to rant about. He immediately stomped his feet and slammed the table in the dining hall (which was also the office), and the teachers were also stirred up. Except for the two teachers who were directly related to the director of general affairs, everyone else made the director of general affairs the target of their anger, blaming him for the unpaid salaries. They demanded that he immediately ask the principal to come to a meeting. The director of general affairs, who had been put in charge by the principal and only knew how to wear a tie and polish his shoes, had no choice but to tuck his tail between his legs and rush to the principal's residence. The teachers all cursed that the toilet and the kitchen shouldn't be in the same room, but in the end, it was still the centipede's fault for not knowing its place. Mr. Fan was extremely pleased, spitting everywhere, "spitting in every direction."

"Mr. Fan," Little Lu said again, "You can't let up this time! Everyone's going to get rid of that Director Wang, and then we'll want you to take over."

"No, no, not at all," Mr. Fan said, his eyes smiling. "When I was the director of general affairs, I never took a single thing. How can you compare me to these inexperienced young people who immediately become corrupt and illegal? Heh, it's really what they call 'the younger generation is to be feared!'"

"Of course," Little Lu said, "Back then, we had fish and meat at every meal. If it weren't for your old scholar's integrity, could we have done that?"

"We are people who are well-versed in the teachings of the sages…" Mr. Fan spat even further. "Can we be compared to these cart drivers and peddlers?"

"Hahaha…" Little Lu laughed.

"Hahaha…" Mr. Fan also laughed.

The principal naturally couldn't refuse to come. As soon as he arrived, the dining hall immediately fell silent. Ignoring the fact that there were still classes in the afternoon, he immediately called a meal meeting. Before the meeting, he asked Mr. Fan to come to his office for a few private words. The three square tables in the dining hall were put together to form a conference room.

Of course, the principal was the chairman, and of course, the principal spoke first:

"...Director of General Affairs, Mr. Wang, is young and doesn't know much, and he doesn't have experience in running the meals. I think that in the future, we should let our colleagues organize a food committee themselves to manage the meals. I don't know if everyone agrees."

Silence, passed.

"However, I have a humble opinion," Mr. Fan proposed. "Food is our nature. Everyone wants to eat well, but they also want to eat cheaply. I want both bear's paws and fish, but I can't have both. If you want it cheap, you can only have a basket of rice and a gourd of water, and Hui doesn't change his joy. If you want to eat well, we teachers have meager salaries and can't afford it. However, when Heaven is about to entrust a great mission to a person, it must first exhaust his mind, temper his body, and burden his skin. That's my opinion. What do you think?"

"That's best," the principal said. "Everyone wants it good and cheap, but it's also a fact that we can't afford it. I think it doesn't matter if the vegetables are a little bad, because saving money for everyone is never wrong. As long as it's clean and affordable, that's all that matters. What do you all think?"

Silence, no objection, passed. "Then I think we should form a food committee! Mr. Fan is old and virtuous and has experience in running the meals, so let's ask him to be the chairman of the food committee."

"That, that, how can that be?" Mr. Fan declined with a face full of shame.

"Don't be modest," the principal said. "I think everyone has always admired Mr. Fan, and if the public recommends you, it's not good to refuse."

"In that case, I can only accept it with shame," Mr. Fan said, bowing to everyone.

"I think," the principal said, "Two more food committee members will be enough. One is Director of General Affairs, Mr. Wang, who will be convenient for contacting various matters. And another one - I think Mr. Lu will be good. What do you all think?"

Silence, complete agreement, passed.

"Okay," the chairman said. "Starting tomorrow, the meals will be taken over by the food committee. The salaries for this month were supposed to be paid today, but this morning, I had a visit from someone who is a director in Nanjing, so I accompanied him all morning. After eating, I was just about to go to the bank to get the money when Mr. Wang came to call me. I didn't have time to go, so we'll issue them tomorrow. With the salaries issued, it will be easier to run the meals. Rice should be bought immediately, and oil and firewood can be purchased a little cheaper if possible. If Mr. Fan doesn't make contact, then please Mr. Wang make the arrangements."

The twenty dan of rice bought at the beginning of the semester had only about five dan eaten. The principal had said that it was bought for the teachers first. There were also several boxes of oil and dozens of bundles of firewood, which of course were not included in the "transfer" list. Prices had jumped threefold, but no one dared to ask a question.

"Anything else to propose?" The principal pulled out his big gold pocket watch and looked at it. After waiting for about half a minute, he announced, "No proposals, meeting adjourned."

The entire meeting lasted ten and eight and a half minutes. End.

"This is a piece of bacon bone," Mr. Fan secretly said to Little Lu when they were discussing the future meal plans that evening. "You young people don't know, but when the burden is put on you, you have to do it."

Little Lu smiled knowingly, without saying a word, not laughing or singing his tune.

Mr. Fan was old after all. Since becoming the chairman of the food committee, his temper had really decreased a lot. He didn't even get angry at the director of general affairs when there were fewer pages in the textbook, but instead said that the students were too narrow-minded. He hadn't been heard talking about "scholarship," and the "sand" in his voice was lighter when he taught because he wasn't speaking with as much force, allowing the students' laughter and the sound of "paper bullets" to drown it out. But he didn't show his age at all in running the meals. He was even more enthusiastic in serving than his nephew, the director of general affairs.

### Two Essays

Ode to Water Foam

I carry the heavy burden of life: I look up and gaze at the arduous path ahead, only to see layers of thick fog and bursts of fishy odor; the feelings of terror and timidity almost make me lose the courage and determination to grope forward.

I carry the heavy burden of life: I walk to the water's edge, leaning against an old pine tree, staring at the ever-changing clouds; the clouds symbolize this matter, and also symbolize life. Suddenly I look down, and the calm water surface is rippling with silver pearl-like foam, resisting the impact of the waves. It rises and falls, each tiny water foam tightly linked together. The more violent the impact of the waves, the more water foam gathers; continuing to resist, continuing to struggle, and in its struggle and resistance, it is showing the flow of the river. In an instant, the silver pearl-like foam has turned into a snow-white wave. - Then I remembered the ancients saying: "Time passes like this! Never ceasing day and night." The flow of water is like the fleeting of time, and the water foam and waves are the brilliance of life; therefore, only constant action can prove the truth of life.

I carry the heavy burden of life: With a smile on my lips, I leave the lonely pine tree and move forward to face the arduous path. I hold the greatest determination, which is this, step after step, row upon row, learning the spirit of water foam!

I carry the heavy burden of life: I hear the waterfall roaring in the mountainside, like an impatient old man, shouting to his companions in a majestic voice to wash away the dirt in the mountains because he cannot stand the filth in the mountains and forests. I also see the silver pearl-like water foam, longing for the cleanliness and brightness of the mountain rocks and tree roots after they have been washed clean, happily dancing with its companions. Doing cleaning work in the mountains.

I carry the heavy burden of life: I walk to the top of the mountain to greet the morning sun. I want to see the morning sun shine on the mountainside and the foot of the mountain, on the streamside and the riverside, I want to see the water foam dancing in the morning sun, silver pearls turning into ten thousand golden stars, illuminating the dark earth and washing away the filth of the world.

I carry the heavy burden of life, and excitedly walk to the bright earth, to the human world. Like a pilgrim to the mountains, I piously explore the true and beautiful life, step by step, row upon row. It is midnight; everything is silent, and the earth has fallen asleep. I bathe in the moonlight, dragging my tired steps, still continuing to move forward. As long as there is still a bay of flowing water in this world; a few drops of water foam, I will always be patient and happy. I want to find the waterfront, scoop up a handful of clear spring water to wash away the wind dust on my face and heart; I want to sit by the dam, letting the breeze blow away my fatigue; I want to lie down and listen carefully to the gentle and moving voice of the water foam; I want it to tell me again the story of its friend who is not stained by the mud. The mud shows destruction, and also foreshadows new life!

In the blink of an eye, the east is slightly white, I leap up with this beautiful story and light steps. In the sound of the crowing of the rooster, I run towards dawn.

### Shadow

Every night, rain or shine, I always have to walk around the secluded streets for a lap, and I have been in this habit for almost a year. Walking on the dark street, I seem to have broken away from reality and galloped in the realm of my heart, I call this leisure enjoyment; it is also a kind of experience.

The streets are quiet, the night is cool as water, and occasionally a streetcar whizzes by, making a sharp sound; but this does not detract from the beauty of the night, and everything is even quieter, so quiet that you can only hear your own footsteps treading on the flat road, making a rustling sound.

The cat-eyed streetlights are shining a circle of dim yellow halo, and accompanying me is the dark shadow that shakes beside me, following my steps. Although it never speaks; I know it is my confidant, it understands me as much as I understand it. I turn my head slightly to peek at it, it is so dignified, using a silent attitude to point out my mistakes and criticize my cowardice. Under its questioning, I can't answer anything; besides acquiescing, I only feel a heavier heart. I can't listen anymore, I want to escape it. So I quickly accelerated my pace, and when I stopped at the corner, wanting to take a breath, it was by my side again.

I bowed my head and continued walking, my heart pounding violently. The evening wind blew against my face, and I felt a cool breeze; I heard a gentle tone saying, "Combine thought and action; those who are unwilling to be slaves will not perish!" With shame and gratitude, I was so moved that I couldn't help but shed tears.

In a hazy mood, I was standing at the door of my house; preparing to push the door in, I timidly reached out my hand to say goodbye to it. But, I don't know when it was gone, only the door light widened its eyes and stared at me strangely.

### Recent Developments in the World of Literature

— Zhao Jingshen

Recently, the number of playwrights in the Swedish capital has been greater than during wartime. They have not been disappointed, and the Royal Theatre of Stockholm has staged many extremely interesting plays. This theatre is supported by the government and is one of the best in Europe, receiving an annual subsidy of 90,000 yuan from the government. However, the theatre also relies on box office revenue, generating an additional 350,000 yuan annually. With this funding, they stage plays ranging from modern American, French, and English works all the way to Shakespeare, at prices much lower than on Broadway in America.

The Royal Theatre began its theatrical season with "Life With Father," directed by Stig Torslow. This season lasts for five or six months, although critics felt that the play was not worthy of being performed at the national theatre. "Castle of Silk" (Silkeborg), a play written by Kjell Abell with the occupation of Denmark as its theme, received extreme praise from critics, perhaps due to sympathy for their Scandinavian sister nation outweighing the play's actual merit. The play was written shortly after the occupation of Denmark and published quickly, recalling Denmark in 1900 with a mixture of realism and symbolism.

The second play staged was Hjalmar Bergman's "Markurells I Wadkoping, 1979," which is purely Swedish in character, set against the backdrop of a small town. The central figure, Markurells, is a cave-dwelling, goblin-like ugly man, outwardly crude and boastful, but extremely sensitive and deeply in love with his only son. He is deceived and ridiculed by everyone, even his wife, who has never told him the child is not his. Just before the boy is about to graduate from high school, Markurells discovers the truth, and his heart breaks. But when the boy happily passes his exam, the first thing he does is tell his father, shouting, "Father, Father!..." Embracing his father, Markurells forgets all the ridicule he has suffered, moved by this outpouring of affection, and knows now that this child is undoubtedly his son. Anders de Wahl, a famous Swedish romantic actor, now 78 years old, plays the male lead. The play is as popular as it was when it premiered in 1922, because it truly captures the spirit and background of Sweden.

After performing Molière's "The School for Wives" at the Drottningholm Theatre near Stockholm, the Royal Theatre staged "Richard III." Lars Hanson, considered to be the greatest living Swedish actor, played the crippled and arrogant Richard with great power. However, the play was too long, lasting a full four hours, which was exhausting for both the audience and the actors. The play was directed by Alf Sjoberg. Hanson, now 62 years old, had performed this role in the capital 25 years ago and is still as youthful as he was in the original production.

Racine's "Britannicus," directed by Olof Molander, and Cora Sandel's "Krane's Tavern" from Norway, completed the theatrical season.

Other plays performed in various theatres included Shaw's "Man and Superman" and Stig Dagarman's new play "Den Dodsdomde" (The Condemned Man). Dagarman had written three novels and many short stories by the age of 24, but this was his first play. The play is about a male protagonist who is condemned to death for murdering his wife, but in reality, her lover murdered her. He nearly dies but is eventually released. Feeling unjustly judged, he angrily kills a woman, using this as the only loophole to turn himself in again.

### Reader's Opinion: Serving Society or Monopolizing for Profit?

— A Reader Hopes the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company Will Come to Its Senses

To the Editor: Since May, the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities have increased their prices by 20%, which has been met with fierce criticism. It is also said that the Municipal Council is investigating the accounts of various public utilities and examining the rationality of the price increases, with the aim of preventing further increases. Although the price increase in May has already been implemented, the censure from public opinion and the actions of the Municipal Council have at least given the people some comfort, and have made the various public utilities more cautious about future price increases.

Consider the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company in our Qingpu. They enjoy the exclusive right to operate on the Qinghu Road, and their business is thriving. Since May, they have increased their prices by 80%. Fortunately, there is no second company on the road to compete for business, so they can be unscrupulous. They have forgotten that public utilities are monopolies concerning social welfare and the people's livelihoods. This monopoly should be aimed at serving society. Its nature should not be compared to a "trust," and its prices should absolutely not be allowed to monopolize for profit. Unfortunately, Qingpu is a small place with virtually no public opinion, and the County Council exists but is ineffective. I have long admired your newspaper for its efforts to serve society, and I respectfully request that you uphold justice and expose this issue, so that the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company will come to its senses and transform from monopolizing for profit to serving society. This would be a great blessing for the common people! From Shi Yuanren, a reader in Qingpu.

### Streamlining Organizations

— Sun He

Streamlining organizations is, in principle, a praiseworthy endeavor. Too many parallel institutions and overlapping structures not only waste national funds but also give ordinary people the feeling that there are too many "parent officials." It is not a small problem for the "subjects" to "support" them with "coarse food," and it often leads to confusion. Public affairs are often like a football, kicked back and forth, and a matter that could be resolved in three days may take three months to complete.

However, there are two points worth noting that accompany this move:

Where will the personnel go after the organizations are reduced? Eating is a problem. It seems that this large group of people cannot be allowed to be idle and unemployed.

Streamlining organizations is a step towards improving political efficiency, but it is not the same as improving political efficiency. It also depends on whether the work is being done diligently and whether bureaucratic practices are reduced to a minimum. Reducing the amount of water can certainly make the medicine more concentrated, but if the medicine is not changed, the disease will not go away.

### Too Much Historical Data

— Mei Bai

The biggest difficulty a historian often encounters is the lack of historical data, making it impossible to write with any basis. After World War II, the situation was exactly the opposite. It is said that there is simply too much historical data, making it impossible to know where to start.

The U.S. government's archives recently released some figures: From the beginning of U.S. history until the attack on Pearl Harbor, the government preserved archives occupying approximately 700,000 cubic feet. However, since the attack on Pearl Harbor, the archives sent by various units and government departments alone already occupy more than 18 million cubic feet. After the Tokyo war crimes trials are completed, it is feared that there will be a large number of archives to come. Among these vast documents, some are indeed of great value, but many are meaningless. To carefully identify them is not an easy task.

In fact, American historians saw this point in the early stages of the war, so they suggested to President Roosevelt that special war history commissioners be assigned to various units and government agencies. All archives and other historical materials would first be edited and organized by them. This suggestion was adopted and implemented immediately, but personnel disputes in various agencies were quite fierce. Those involved tried to cover up their mistakes as much as possible, and when pointing fingers at others, they often fabricated stories without any basis in fact. For example, one of the agencies with the most disputes was the War Production Board. Several leaders disagreed from the beginning and continued to argue until Japan surrendered, without interruption. Even when writing personal memoirs, they are still attacking each other. And when the "historical commissioner" of the War Production Board wanted to gather some facts from all sides, he was met with resistance everywhere. The answer he often received was: "These matters are not related to the public and do not need to be recorded."

The situation in the military was the same, but the crux of the problem was simpler: Anything unfavorable to the unit commander was not made public. Even if a general made a very obvious mistake, so that the general public had already realized that he should be held responsible for a particular setback, the unit still strictly adhered to the creed of "concealing evil and promoting good," and would never reveal the true relevant materials.

In addition to these archives, the memoirs of famous people are naturally extremely important. Memoirs have been published by Churchill, Hull, Bernays, and Stimson. Many deceased dignitaries, such as Hopkins and General Stilwell, have had their biographies compiled by others, which have also been completed one by one. They were on the scene, so what they say should carry weight, but even with Bernays' "Speaking Frankly," Dewey, the Governor of New York, who is the most promising candidate for the next presidential election, said that Bernays was the most ignorant Secretary of State for international relations in American history! And the biases of Churchill and Stilwell are even more well-known.

In addition, the number of letters between American presidents is also truly astounding. For example, former President Taft had approximately one million letters preserved in the Library of Congress. In addition, there are 15,000 pages of the president's own diary, all in densely arranged small characters. But Taft is like a small witch compared to Roosevelt (referring to F.D.R, not Theodore Roosevelt). The letters of Roosevelt now preserved in the Hyde Park residence and the Library of Congress would stretch for miles in bookshelves, causing ambitious historians to only sigh with frustration.

### More Talk on Letters

— Zheng Yimei

Contemporary people who use self-made stationery for their letters are not uncommon. For example, Chen Kuilong used longevity character stationery, with a longevity character in the middle and the words "Made by Yong Sou in the fifth month of Bingzi, at the age of eighty" on the side. It was narrow and long, intended for use as a memo. Zhu Fengwei used Nengyin Huxiao Guan stationery, Gu Dingmei used Jin Jiashi Haoqi stationery, She Jingao used San Dingyi stationery, Chen Julai used An Te stationery, Wu Hufan used Lv Bian Chitang Cao Ci stationery, Ye Yuhu used Xia An stationery, Zhou Shoujuan used Zi Luolan Tan stationery, Zhao Mianyun used Xin Han Ge stationery, Zhang Biwu used Bi Wu Tong Guan stationery, Zhou Meiquan used Jin Jue Yi stationery, Gao Chuiwan used Ge Yi stationery, Chen Meng'an used Ren Fangyi stationery, Huang Yunong used Zhe Xiang Guan stationery, and Wu Meisun used Han Paoyi stationery. Others include Chen Zihe's Baiye Guan stationery, Tang Qilin's Xiu Haiqi stationery, Ling Xu's Mang Wu Qingzhai stationery, Chao Zhangfu's Haitian Lou stationery, Chen Congzhou's Sui Yue Lou stationery, and Yu Huishu's Feng Bu Ning Qi stationery, the list is endless.

Many of my friends are painters, and they often use plain stationery to draw one or two branches of flowers on it before writing a letter, such as Shang Shengbo and Yao Yuqin. Deng Chunshu even uses fan-shaped paper, as if writing a note on the fan, which is particularly unique.

To commemorate my deceased friends, I have specially mounted their letters and titled them "The Lament of Human and Qin." Initially, there were only more than ten people, including the master of Shuliu Shanfang, Bi Jian, Li Hanqiu, Yu Tiansui, Zhu Yuanchu, Wang Junqing, Xu Zhiyan, Jiang Zhuchao, Tao Baopi, Wang Meiyin, Sun Shishun, and Wu Shuangshu. Who would have known that in a few years, hundreds of them would pass away? Occasionally, when I check them, I cannot help but feel sad and nostalgic for the past.

The ancients said that one should not reject words because of the person. I do not reject letters because of the person. I have also collected several letters from Wang Jingwei, Wang Shulu, Chu Minyi, and the master of Yuanju Pavilion. I still regret missing the letters of Zhu Huo and Huang Qiuyue, because Qiuyue's handwriting was particularly exquisite.

I have letters from eminent monks such as Yinguang, Hongyi, and Taixu; elderly scholars from the Hanlin Academy, such as Yu Biyun, Zhi Xin Jian, Shen Qiquan, Shang Yanying, Qian Ziyan, Wu Yinpei, Lu Fengshi, Zhang Yanchang, and Cheng Zongyi; and foreign people, such as the Japanese artist Hashimoto Kansetsu, who wrote in Chinese with a brush. These are the unique features of my collected letters.

### Zhao Guni Died from Pufferfish

— Qian Dacheng

I previously revealed anecdotes about Zhao Guni in Free Talk. Yesterday, I met my uncle-in-law Wang Jiyu, who had a deep friendship with Guni, and he told me that the reason for Guni's death was actually due to his lack of restraint in eating. My uncle-in-law heard that Guni was ill, so he went to visit him and saw Guni busy整理 arranging his lifelong printed seal collection. My uncle-in-law said to him, "You are sick, why don't you take it easy?" Guni said, "I am just using it to pass the time!" Then he smiled and said to my uncle-in-law, "My favorite food is now on the market again." My uncle-in-law knew it was pufferfish and quickly warned Guni, "You are sick, be sure not to eat this stuff!" He nodded casually. A few days later, he heard that Guni was getting sicker, so he visited him again and said to Guni, "You must have eaten pufferfish!" He smiled and said, "I only ate a little, and my family took it away. How can it be so effective." Not long after, Guni died.

Initially, Guni also suffered from malaria and could not recover for a long time, so he filled a large bowl with cold rice, served with cold braised pork, and drank Suiyang Spring (a famous spring in Yushan, in Xiaoyao You) with it; he lay down on the bed and slept soundly, sweating profusely, and then recovered. He often boasted about this to people, calling it a miraculous cure for malaria. A friend told him not to use it as a model, but he did not listen. He eventually lost his life to his curiosity and old age. It is a pity. Otherwise, Guni should have enjoyed a long life because of his health and strength. Why only sixty years? But he was optimistic and resigned to fate. When he was seriously ill, he sighed and said, "I am just a small child from the countryside, traveling with scholars and officials, hunting for fame, and living to be sixty years old. Heaven has not failed me!"

My friend Shen Bao Yi told me: Guni once lived in his house, and when he was carving seals, he liked to eat snacks, especially pine nuts.

Guni also liked to gamble and play mahjong; however, he did not allow people to watch. If someone happened to be watching, he would play the middle, wealth, or white tile that was in pairs or three tiles, and the onlookers would be surprised and say that he had played the wrong tile. Then he would stand up and say, "It is my freedom to deal the cards, and there is no fixed rule? Since you are interested, you can take a seat!" He then left.

Guni liked to climb mountains and visit water, and he was also good at appraising bones and sharks. He obtained Yuan chops in Yangzhou and Han bricks in Hangzhou, and all his funds came from this.

Guni was also good at painting. Mr. Yang Xianyi said that his flowers were very similar to Li Futang.

When Guni was dying, Mr. Yuanxi summarized his life and wrote a twenty-chapter lament, which said, "Shi Ji did not refrain from eating, risking death to eat pufferfish; Reed sprouts gradually grow, and the spring continent cuts off people's souls." "Shi Nong has a strict wind and bones, and harmonizes the light to return to the dust; Although there is an iron gate limit, he is afraid of befriending new dignitaries." Mr. Yang does not easily praise people, so we can know what kind of person Guni was.

Guni died on April 14th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. He wrote the Bai Yi Lu Seal Collection in forty volumes, and the Ni Daoren Poems in two volumes. Mr. Jin Shuyuan, a fellow villager, wrote his tomb inscription.

It has been fifteen years since Guni died, and there are many who imitate his calligraphy for profit; however, their work is just sheepskin over a tiger, and they cannot capture even one iota of his spirit.

Mr. He Shiqi and his daughter Yiru are currently holding a father-daughter painting and calligraphy exhibition at the Chinese Painting Garden. The picture shows a recent work by Ms. Yiru.

### Onions Cure Diseases

— Yuchuang

If you pick up a raw onion, peel off the outer layer, and chew it in your mouth for five minutes—your mouth can be said to have been thoroughly disinfected, and all bacteria and microorganisms have disappeared. Sometimes, chewing for just one minute can kill all microorganisms in the mouth. This is the result of recent research by Soviet scholar Dr. Tokin.

Many American scientists have also engaged in research on onions. According to them, although the smell of onions is not very pleasant, the smell itself can kill germs. They have begun to mash onions and use the smell to "fumigate" the inflamed, festering, and painful areas of patients' wounds, often with the effect of relieving pain and reducing swelling, and promoting new flesh. Soviet doctors have also tried to use the smell of onions to treat inflamed and festering wounds. Each time, they use one or two onions, mash them, and place them in a shallow dish, making the area similar to the size of the wound. After "fumigating" for ten minutes, they can reduce swelling and dissolve pus. After "fumigating" twice, new flesh can grow.

### "Xuandang"

— You Mojun

While monitoring self-study at night, a classmate was reading letters. He asked me what "Xuandang Yuyin" means. I said that "Chun" is used to compare to the father, and "Xuan" is used to compare to the mother. This usage has a long history, so "Xuandang" means mother. When used with "Yuyin," it means that "Chun" is no longer around. According to the poem "How to get Xuan grass, to plant it on the back," there is no doubt that calling the mother "Xuan" comes from the Book of Songs. However, it always feels very inappropriate, because the alias of Xuan grass is "prostitute," see Compendium of Materia Medica!

I think it is more appropriate to respectfully call someone's mother "Zuntang." There is already the phrase "Zuntang Youzhuo" in Lu Shilong's reply to Zhuo Maoan's letter, which can be proved. Otherwise, it is also okay to use "Taifuren." Du Fu's poem has the line "Get up and sit down, Taifuren," which is very generous.

### Self-Inscription on Zhu Bamboo

— Sanmu

The teacher drew with research ink, wrote bamboo after being drunk,

The brush stroke rushes like a galloping horse, the smell of alcohol sweeps across the seats.

At first glance, it is bright and radiant, like the fire of Luhun,

Zhu Rong throws as he pleases, and many gods and ghosts fall;

Again, he suspected the sorrow of the sad old man, full of blood and tears on paper,

Struggling to advance the liver and intestines, covering his face and weeping like rain.

The guest said that the teacher was drunk, why bother himself,

The teacher replied, no, how can the guest know me?

What world is this? Slaughter is everywhere,

Each with a barbarian heart, their anger refuses to fall,

Not only the disaster of Luhun, but for a long time, the universe has been tossed,

Alas, the vast sky, why does it not care for the suffering people?

I want to eradicate the evil bamboo, the evil bamboo is indeed numerous,

I want to escape the world, where can I be naked,

Writing this is as it should be, I hope the guest will not laugh at me.

After speaking, the guest also realized, and reported with a loud voice that it was okay,

Raising his head to look at the blue sky, he covered all the summers without a word.

### 

Reading the twenty portraits of the new cabinet's heads of departments and commissions on the front page of the first day of this month, one by one, seeing the last old hero, I couldn't help but feel nostalgic for the past. This gentleman has a very deep qualification in the officialdom, has experienced a lot, and is still healthy today. Looking at his expression, he is not very old. Judging by his age, he should have passed the age of seventy.

This old hero is an old scholar from fifty years ago (Qian Qing Guangxu Ding Chou 科 in the 23rd year), and he was proud of the court examination and was used as a small Beijing official of the seventh rank, assigned to the Ministry of Justice, and thus entered the judicial field. In the late Qing Dynasty, his career was rising, from Beijing to outside, the old judge had served as the Provincial Judge (that is, Guosi, the third rank, the general meeting of criminal names in a province, the authority of the "blue robe" in the "Yutangchun" three-hall joint trial, which is enough to be realistic, I have detailed textual research on the drama special edition of the Beijing Daily and Tianjin Dagong Daily in Beiping); the new judge served as the Chief of the Higher Court (that is, the President of the Higher Court in the early Republic of China, now the President of the Higher Court). He had a scholar who was also a courtier, an official in the Ministry of Justice, and a fellow Anhui villager, whose name was Wang Shouzhen. The two had a very close friendship, did not forget each other in wealth and honor, and supported each other. When the old Xu served as the Fengtian Higher Court, Wang was also the Heilongjiang Higher Court. In the early years of the Republic of China, Xu and Wang were both senior officials in the judicial field. They were inseparable, and now the old Xu is still young and strong, but Wang has been silent for a long time.

The legal world has always been divided into two factions, one is the old Ministry of Justice, and the other is students studying abroad. The old Ministry of Justice practiced precedents and was familiar with the old laws and case handling experience, such as the above-mentioned Xu Wang and Dong Kang Wang Shitong. Students studying in the East and West oceans are based on the new laws of modern civilization. When the late Qing Dynasty reformed and improved the judiciary due to the corruption of the Daqing Law and the old criminal officials, students studying abroad and talents studying new laws in the country naturally became the pride of the times. However, several old roles in the old Ministry of Justice also held important positions during the transition period of the former Qing Dynasty, and they also studied new knowledge, were good at administration, so although the graduates were widely used as judges and officials in the early years of the Republic of China, several chiefs still needed old masters, such as the old Xu, who was appointed as the Minister of Justice in the first year of the Republic of China, because he was quite famous in the three northeastern provinces in the late Qing Dynasty, and Xu Shichang was between the old Yuan and the old Duan, and was highly regarded. However, his initial knowledge of the old Xu was due to a special manifestation of the police affairs. At the time of Li in the Qing Dynasty, the Qing court initially established the police administration, and Xu and Zhao Bingjun were appointed as officials in charge, and personnel from various departments were transferred. The matter was newly created, and many nobles and high-ranking officials were not restrained, and difficult problems emerged one after another. Xu was transferred as a minor official, and he solved the problem properly with his ingenuity. He was thus known and praised, and in a few years, he rose to the third rank. After serving as the chief of the legal department for a period of time in the early years of the Republic of China, his career became multi-faceted, such as the Fujian Governor (that is, the governor of the province at that time), the Minister of Transportation (during the Li President Duan cabinet), the Prime Minister of the State Council (during the old Duan's administration), and the Ambassador to Japan before the July 7th Incident (I heard that the old Duan was recommended, and when he was first appointed, Duan was still alive), which was also an important diplomatic task. It can be said that he was a "multi-talented" "Jun Ren". My cousin Suichu likes to talk about physiognomy, and once said that Xu's whole body is five short (the body and limbs are short), and the position of the five senses on the face is strict and the energy is concentrated. It is said that the "golden shape" is a precious emblem. I am not very familiar with this way, but because his words are quite interesting, I will attach them here.
