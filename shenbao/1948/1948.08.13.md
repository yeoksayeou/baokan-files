[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang held a regular meeting on the morning of the 12th and passed routine cases such as the Control Committee's measures for supervising party-operated enterprises. Committee Member Gu stated that the late Committee Member Wang Zijhuang had served for ten years, was honest and self-disciplined, and was a model for others.

During the meeting, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng reported on the handling of the minutes of the party affairs symposium. It is understood that the aforementioned minutes are being compiled by the Secretariat and will be submitted to the Standing Committee for review in the near future. The rumor that a party affairs review meeting will be held in Guling is purely inaccurate.

### Ministry of Finance Revises Measures for Discounting US Dollar Bonds

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The past method of discounting US dollar bonds for the 36th year was calculated according to the exchange rate of the Central Bank. Since the promulgation of the foreign exchange measures in August of last year, it has been calculated according to the exchange rate of designated banks in Shanghai. Now, since the implementation of the exchange settlement certificate method, the Ministry of Finance has revised the previous discounting methods. The interest to be discounted on US dollar bonds that is above one US dollar shall be paid in the original US dollar currency. The fractional amount below one dollar shall still be converted into national currency according to the exchange rate of the Stabilization Fund Committee.

### President Invites Veterans to Guling; Vice President Li's Return to the South Undetermined

[This newspaper, Guling, 12th] It is reported that the President, in view of the extreme heat in Nanjing and Shanghai, sent a telegram after arriving in Guling inviting veterans Ding Weifen, Cai Jitao, Zou Lu, Ju Zheng, and Shao Lizi, who are currently in Nanjing and Shanghai, to come to Guling to escape the summer heat.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Vice President Li is spending the summer in Beiping, in a relaxed and comfortable mood. He often plays chess with Mr. Tai Shihui for more than three or four hours each time. Recently, he seems to have no intention of returning to the south. A reporter recently asked Mrs. Li when the Vice President would return to the south. Mrs. Li replied, "I am mute, I don't know." A group of reporters visited Li's residence on the 12th, but Li was out and had not returned. His staff said that the date of his return to the south has not yet been determined.

[This newspaper, Guling, 12th] President Chiang summoned Secretary-General Chen Burei at 6 p.m. on the 12th and spoke with him for a long time. Mr. Chen flew from Nanjing to Xun in the President's special plane at 8 a.m. on the 12th and arrived in Guling at noon.

### Executive Yuan Holds Subcommittee Meeting to Discuss Policy on Disposal of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] After the abolition of the Cotton Yarn Management Committee and the Fuel Management Committee under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the government's policy on the disposal of cotton yarn, cloth, and fuel, after the Ministry of Industry and Commerce formulated its opinions, was submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting on the 11th for discussion and then handed over for review. On the morning of the 12th, Zhang Lisheng convened a subcommittee meeting to discuss it. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qida first explained the Ministry's proposed measures for assisting cotton yarn and cloth. According to these measures, private manufacturers will be assisted without violating the principle of abolishing regulatory agencies by the Legislative Yuan. However, some attendees believed that the current rise in various commodity prices is based on the price of cotton yarn and cloth. If it is completely liberalized, it is feared that it will soar and create adverse phenomena in the market. Therefore, it was argued that there should still be appropriate management. However, since the Legislative Yuan's principle of abolishing regulatory agencies is clearly contrary to this, and under the current situation of the first session of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution, it is necessary to achieve the purpose of abiding by the law. Therefore, after detailed discussions, it was decided to convene another meeting at a fixed date, inviting relevant parties to participate, so as to study a proper solution. The most important point is still to solve practical problems through legal means. Therefore, before the Legislative Yuan reconvenes, it is feared that no decision will be made on these measures. It is also learned that the main points of the organization of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Assistance Committee to be established by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are as follows: (1) The main tasks are divided into domestic sales and export. The committee is only responsible for domestic sales. After the arrival of US aid cotton, it will be responsible for distributing it to various private yarn mills, and will still implement the method of spinning and weaving on behalf of others, exchanging cotton for yarn and yarn for cloth. The proceeds from the sale of goods will then be deposited into a designated account at the Central Bank. Exports will be handled by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Export Committee under the US Aid Utilization Committee. (2) Formulate measures for the unified purchase of raw cotton. (3) Matters related to the increased production, transportation, and sales of cotton yarn and cloth. (4) Management and assistance for cotton yarn and cloth. (5) All matters related to cotton yarn and cloth from the Ministries of Agriculture and Industry will be handled by the committee.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shijie issued the following statement on the 12th announcing the recognition of the South Korean government: "The South Korean government has been established through popular elections under the supervision of the United Nations. The independence of South Korea is a traditional aspiration of China. Since the Cairo Conference, assisting the Korean people in restoring their country has become a common promise of the major Allied powers. However, since the surrender of Japan, the liberation of South Korea has been repeatedly delayed. The United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea, with its firm and impartial efforts, has fulfilled its responsibilities in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, so that Korea can produce a truly democratic government. After fully considering all relevant factors, the Chinese government believes that China has the right and obligation to immediately establish diplomatic relations with this South Korean government. I am pleased to announce that, before the United Nations General Assembly discusses the aforementioned report of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea, based on the traditional friendly spirit between the Chinese and Korean peoples, the South Korean government is temporarily recognized, and Dr. Liu Yuwan is appointed as the diplomatic representative of the Chinese government to South Korea with the title of ambassador."

Editorial

### August 13th: On Sino-Japanese Trade

This morning, eleven years ago, the sound of artillery fire in Shanghai marked the beginning of China's full-scale war of resistance. Today, as we commemorate "August 13th," we recall the spirit of the soldiers and civilians who bravely sacrificed themselves in the Battle of Shanghai eleven years ago. Looking ahead to the domestic turmoil after the victory of the War of Resistance, we are filled with emotions! Furthermore, we see that the defeated aggressor nation has not only escaped "punishment" but has also begun to recover under the "support" of the victorious nations. Its rapid recovery is almost unparalleled in history. From Washington and London to Canberra, Manila, Hong Kong, and China, discussions about restoring Sino-Japanese trade are everywhere, but at the same time, there are also calls for boycotting Japanese goods. Even in New York, Japanese goods are being boycotted by veterans and families of the deceased. Therefore, it can be said that it is most appropriate to commemorate August 13th today by examining the issue of Sino-Japanese trade.

It has been almost a full year since General MacArthur advocated opening up Japan's foreign trade. Although Sino-Japanese trade has resumed, it has been in a state of semi-suspension. According to the announcement made by our delegation to Japan in May, the total value of Sino-Japanese trade after the war is only about 40 million U.S. dollars, with Japanese goods imported into China valued at approximately 25 million U.S. dollars and Chinese goods imported into Japan valued at approximately 15 million U.S. dollars, resulting in a trade deficit of approximately 10 million U.S. dollars for China. From this point alone, it can be understood that the so-called "Sino-Japanese trade" cannot be said to have been restored. However, recently, due to General MacArthur's order to lift restrictions on Japanese export trade and the U.S. government's renewed proposal to restore Sino-Japanese trade as soon as possible, discussions about restoring Sino-Japanese trade have once again shifted from silence to liveliness.

According to a report by the Associated Press, a senior official of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) stated on the 8th that "the 275 million U.S. dollar economic aid program for China can be indirectly used to assist in the restoration of China's foreign trade—including trade with Japan." He also pointed out that restoring Sino-Japanese trade "will facilitate China's use of Japanese industry to seek recovery." At the same time, Congressman Judd also expressed his opinion, advocating for the rapid restoration of pre-war trade patterns in the Far East. He also believed that "China's industrialization will take 30 to 90 years, so there will be no industrial competition between China and Japan within a century." Regardless of the intentions behind the U.S.'s release of such arguments, on the surface, the U.S. advocates for China's restoration of trade with Japan, hoping that both China and Japan will benefit. The so-called "this move will facilitate China's use of Japanese industry to seek recovery," and the idea that "Japan must rely on the Chinese market to survive" reflect this sentiment.

China, as a recipient of U.S. economic aid, should carefully consider the U.S.'s good intentions. According to reports in Shanghai newspapers yesterday morning, former Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun will visit Japan to investigate the U.S.'s policy toward Japan and conduct on-site research on the possibility of restoring trade with Japan. This news is not only valued by Chinese and American people but also held with eager hope by all sectors of Japan. From China's perspective, we are not opposed to the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade in principle because mutual exchange between countries is a normal international practice. However, in today's world, where a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, restoring normal commercial relations is both difficult in practice and not entirely justified in legal principle. Even if we take a step back and say that a peace treaty with Japan cannot be concluded for the time being and that we should accommodate the facts and restore Sino-Japanese trade first, there is also a prerequisite. What is this condition? It is to ensure China's interests. Only under this condition do we support the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade.

However, from the perspective of the goods exchanged between China and Japan, it is clear that the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade will only benefit Japan. When the Allied forces opened up trade with Japan this spring, the Japanese authorities stated that they intended to purchase sugar, soybeans, salt, and coal from China and prepare to import bicycles, watches, cameras, and textiles into China. It is clear at a glance that the goods imported into China are all consumables and luxury goods. The continuous influx of Japanese goods into China will not only not contribute to China's national economy and people's livelihood but will also hinder the development of China's national industry. Local public opinion organs have long expressed their opposition to this disguised method of "agricultural China, industrial Japan." The government authorities should not only pay special attention to the direction of public opinion but also take a long-term perspective and make wise choices early. We must not be greedy for short-term gains and neglect the long-term plan for peace in the Far East. Today, as we commemorate "August 13th," we hope to use this as a warning to ourselves and to the entire nation!

### Xu County Weather Clears After Rain, Heavy Losses Throughout the City

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 12th] The heavy rain on the night of the 10th in Xu County caused a disaster, resulting in heavy losses throughout the city.

### Serious Flooding in Jiangxi, President Orders Relief Efforts

[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 12th] The flooding in Jiangxi is serious. When President Chiang met with Jiangxi Chairman Hu Jiafeng in Kuling, he promised to order the responsible ministries to find ways to provide relief. Mr. Hu is still staying in Kuling and plans to return to Nanchang via Xunyang within the next few days. According to Mr. Hu's statement to our reporter on the 12th, more than 50 counties in Jiangxi have reported disasters, with more than 20 counties being severely affected, and the disaster victims are gathering. Jiujiang, Xingzi, Ruichang, Xinjian, Poyang, and other counties are in urgent need of assistance. The provincial government is making every effort to allocate 20 billion yuan for emergency relief, and it is also requesting assistance from the central government. This flood has greatly affected the harvest, and the water levels in the counties along the river and lake have not receded for a while, so there is no hope for the late rice crop. We only hope that other counties will have a bountiful late rice harvest, so that we can overcome the difficulties. This year, the Jiangxi province's tax collection quota has been slightly increased, but the central government has approved the exemption of the affected counties. Regarding the suppression of bandits in southern Jiangxi, Mr. Hu said that in the past, local units were concentrated in one place, and only after learning about bandit activities did they dispatch troops for suppression, which was less effective. Now, the strategy has been changed to implement mobile suppression methods, regularly searching in various places and striking at bandits whenever they are encountered. Currently, one group of bandits in southern Jiangxi has surrendered, and the rest have dispersed. Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces have now established close contact, and the Guangzhou绥署 (綏靖公署, Pacification Headquarters) has set up a command post to suppress bandits in the border areas, and it is hoped that peace can be restored soon. This is Mr. Hu's second visit to Kuling. He visited Kuling once before the war. He said that his impression this time was very good and that everything had improved.

### Luokou Yellow River Water Level Rises

### Lu Yu River Sluice Gate Completed

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Lu Yu River in Luyu Town, Danyang, Jiangsu, extends for 15 li within Wujin County, irrigating approximately 30,000 mu of farmland. Every autumn, when water is needed for the rice crop, the riverbed is too high, and the river water fluctuates with the tide of the Grand Canal, making it difficult to store water for irrigation, which greatly affects the autumn harvest. In order to cooperate with this year's grain production increase plan, the Irrigation and Water Conservancy Engineering Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, at the request of the local farmers' association, has allocated funds from the Grain Production Increase Committee of the Ministry to build the Qiu Gongqiu Sluice Gate, the Lu Yu River Estuary Control Sluice Gate, and the Tang Fuqiao Demonstration Sluice Gate, a total of four sluice gates. Since the office dispatched the 14th Engineering Team to supervise the construction, it has been smooth, and all have now been completed. The benefit extends to more than 30,000 市畝 (a unit of area, approx. 667 square meters) of farmland, and the annual increase in food production is approximately 20,000 市担 (a unit of volume, approx. 50 liters).

This has been tried and tested in Taiwan and has been effective."

### International Children's Emergency Fund: China Receives 7 Million U.S. Dollars for Relief in the Second Half of Next Year; Uses Divided into Food, Clothing, and Medicine

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] According to the Government Information Office, the International Children's Emergency Fund previously allocated 7 million U.S. dollars to China for emergency relief. Recently, the Design Committee and Executive Department meetings were held in Paris from July 3rd to 6th and in Geneva from July 16th to 20th, and it was decided to allocate an additional 7 million U.S. dollars to be used for relief in China from July to the end of next year. The uses of the above-mentioned emergency relief funds have already been determined: (1) 2 million U.S. dollars will be used to purchase pure milk powder, cod liver oil, fat, and rice for shipment to China. The Chinese government will allocate an equal amount of calories in the form of miscellaneous grains, vegetables, salt, etc., to cooperate in providing meals. The areas are tentatively set as nine regions: Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. (2) 850,000 U.S. dollars will be used to purchase American cotton for shipment to China. The Chinese government will be responsible for spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing the cloth to provide clothing relief. (3) 300,000 U.S. dollars will be used to cooperate in providing medical relief. (The clothing and medical relief items are not limited to the nine regions). (4) 500,000 U.S. dollars will be used to provide relief to children in bandit areas. The methods for using the emergency relief funds allocated before and after are still being negotiated. To date, the food that has been shipped includes milk powder and fat. 787,000 pounds of milk powder have been shipped and distributed to various regions. The distribution of this pure milk powder is limited to the poorest infants under 12 months of age. However, based on the recommendations of medical personnel, it may be provided to poor and sick children under the age of 14. The methods for distributing milk powder, feeding milk powder, investigating and selecting beneficiaries, and entrusting the operation of meal supply stations have been formulated. For meal supply stations, the principle is to utilize existing children's welfare and relief organizations, groups, and other social welfare institutions, refugee shelters, and health care institutions as much as possible, and to establish new stations only when necessary, in order to save expenses.

### Ministry of National Defense Releases Weekly War Situation: National Army Achieves Victory in Mobile Operations in Eastern Hebei

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The Ministry of National Defense recently released the war situation for the week of August 5th to 11th as follows:

Since the Central Plains Campaign, it has been more than a month. The bandits on various battlefields are obviously still resting, replenishing, and retreating to feign attacks on weaker areas, due to the deep and painful injuries they have suffered. Therefore, apart from continuing to pursue and suppress bandits in western Shandong and eastern Henan, there were no major battles on any battlefield during this week. We launched mobile operations in eastern Hebei and have achieved considerable victories. After recovering Xiangyang in northern Hubei, the main force of the Liu bandits has retreated to western Henan. A portion of the local Communists led by Li Xiannian are disrupting western Hubei in separate groups. In the Taiyuan area: the National Army continues to make progress in counterattacks. The Peng bandits in central Shaanxi are being forced back by our army step by step, and are now rallying to counterattack, with battles still in progress. In the Northeast: there have been small-scale skirmishes around Changchun for several days. Other areas, such as central Shandong and northern Jiangsu, are relatively peaceful.

North China Battlefield

The National Army's actions have consistently controlled the enemy's momentum, keeping the bandits exhausted. After capturing Santunying, the military and political center of the bandit army in eastern Hebei, on the morning of the 8th, it was discovered that there were many organs and factories in the area, which served as an important supply base for the bandits. The headquarters of the bandit's eastern Hebei military region was also located there. Due to the rapid advance of our army, the bandits did not have time to transport the supplies away. The National Army seized back the materials that the bandits had plundered from the people and distributed them to the people. On the 9th, we crossed Zunhua and advanced towards the bandits. A portion of the bandits had fled out of the Guanwai (beyond the Great Wall) through Jielingkou, while another portion was intercepted by the National Army near Xifengkou and severely attacked. In this battle in eastern Hebei, we captured bandit vehicles, cloth, gasoline, kerosene, wheat, and military supplies and ammunition worth over 100 billion (currency not specified). The cotton quilts alone numbered over 15,000. Currently, there are no large bandit forces near Yutian, Fengrun, Zunhua, and Qian'an. We are closely monitoring the bandits who have fled into the Rehe area.

Taiyuan Periphery

In the past month, the bandits have suffered heavy casualties from our combined land and air attacks. They have recently changed their strategy, trying to avoid fighting with the National Army and instead conducting small-scale ambushes at night, seemingly adopting a long-term siege plan for Taiyuan. In response to this, our army is gradually expanding its counterattack operations. Small and large strongholds on the periphery are being recovered daily. The National Army on the west bank of the Fen River is still advancing south, and the bandits entrenched in Jinyuan are showing signs of wavering under the strong pressure of our army.

Central China Battlefield

After the National Army defeated the stubborn resistance of the bandit army in the Xiangyang area, it recovered Xiangyang and Nanzhang counties on the 5th. The main force of the Liu bandits is still fleeing back to the Fangcheng and Wuyang areas of western Henan. Our forces are carrying out mopping-up operations against the remaining bandits who have fled into the mountains. However, Wu Shi'an and other units, remnants of the Li Xiannian bandits who were defeated by the National Army south of Nantang, were cut off from their retreat route north with Liu Bocheng, so they took advantage of the situation to flee south on the 8th, reaching Dangyang via Yuan'an (where there were no National Army stationed). Their aim is to cut off the traffic on our Jingmen-Yichang highway and take the opportunity to create disturbances in Yichang. However, their forces are only over 5,000 men, and our navy and army are on alert. The large army in central Hubei is also pursuing and suppressing the bandits, and their plans will be difficult to achieve.

Western Henan Area

The National Army is currently coordinating with powerful local forces, advancing on the bandits in separate routes. Jingziguan, an important town on the border of Henan and Shaanxi, which was a base for the Kong Congzhou bandit troops, has been captured by our army. The local forces of Guangwu and Xingyang counties also coordinated with the National Army to recover the cities of Guangwu and Xingyang counties on the 7th and 8th. As for the Liu bandit's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 10th columns, they are still lingering in the Wuyang and Fangcheng areas, reorganizing, with no major battles with our Nanyang National Army.

Central Shandong Area

There have been no major changes in the past week. The main force of the bandits is still in the Tai'an, Laiwu, and Dawenkou area. Our Jinan National Army is constantly conducting powerful searches in the surrounding areas, and the bandit's vanguard units are retreating. In addition, the main force of the Chen bandits, which was compressed between Hao County, Guoyang, and Taihe, has been forced to retreat west to the Shenqiu and Linquan areas by our large army. They have left the Liangguang column in the northeast of Guoyang and the Jin Shaoshan's independent brigade near Dongmingji, in order to contain the National Army. Their main forces, the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 11th, and Fast columns, have retreated to the Shenqiu and Linquan areas, trying to rest and reorganize as much as possible in the empty mountains and hilly areas, taking a long-distance approach to the main forces of the National Army.

Shaanxi Campaign

Since two weeks ago, they have been deeply involved in the Huanglong Mountain area, constantly pursuing and suppressing the Peng bandits. The strongholds of Hancheng, Tangjiashan, and Xuefengzhen have all been recovered by our army. In the Battle of Tangjiashan, we killed over 1,200 people, including the commander of the 5th Field Brigade of the Peng bandit's 3rd Column and below. However, the Peng bandits, after repeated defeats, were unwilling to give up. On the 8th, they concentrated their 1st, 2nd, and 4th columns, a total of about 13 brigade's worth of troops, and launched a counterattack south from the area north of Jiangjun Mountain. They engaged in fierce fighting with our army in the vicinity of Fengyuanzhen. On the 9th, the Peng bandits continued to transfer their 3rd and 6th columns to reinforce, and our army was outnumbered and suffered some losses. Both sides are currently engaged in fierce fighting.

### Three Nation Envoys Went to the Kremlin Yesterday; Fourth Meeting with Molotov; Answered Questions on the Resolution of the German Problem

[News Agency Report] London, 12th Broadcast, Moscow Dispatch: The envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France met with Molotov at the Kremlin again on the evening of the 12th to discuss the German crisis. The three envoys went to the Kremlin at 5:00 p.m. (Moscow time) to resume the preliminary negotiations that began two weeks ago. Some believe that the three envoys will meet with Molotov again on the 13th, and possibly meet with Stalin two days later to conclude the talks at the Kremlin.

[News Agency Report] London, 12th Broadcast, Moscow Dispatch: The envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France left the Kremlin at 8:00 p.m. (Moscow time) on the 12th, after a meeting lasting three hours. When asked if this meeting was the last, US Ambassador Smith replied, "This is not what we know, but I don't think so."

[News Agency Report] London, 12th Broadcast: It is expected that the envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will submit the three governments' written responses to the Soviet Union's views on resolving the issues of Berlin and Germany to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 12th.

[News Agency Report] New York, 12th Broadcast: US Secretary of State Marshall stated in Washington on the 12th that the United States will continue to strive for negotiations with the Soviet Union to resolve disputes between the US and the Soviet Union, but firmly declared that it has no intention of signing a treaty for the sake of a treaty. Regarding the Berlin issue and the ongoing Moscow negotiations, Secretary Marshall declined to comment.

[News Agency Report] London, 12th Broadcast: The belief among Western diplomats that the Berlin deadlock can be broken by the Kremlin negotiations is gradually disappearing. If there is still no sign of progress after the meeting on the 12th, the remaining optimism will vanish. Diplomatic circles believe that the envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France may request another meeting with Stalin to report the lack of success in the negotiations with Molotov, reiterate their promise not to negotiate on the German problem with a threatening attitude, and insist that the Soviet Union should recognize the three countries' legal right to remain in Berlin. It is reported that Molotov insisted on the Soviet Union's original position on the Berlin issue, that is, since the influx of West German currency, the blockade of Berlin is necessary, and the Western plan to establish another government in Germany is enough to endanger the Soviet Union's rights in Berlin. At the same time, the Western powers also insisted on their original position.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th Dispatch] Well-informed sources claim that the Western powers have not yet obtained any guarantees from the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade. Therefore, the three powers have not agreed to postpone the implementation of the London Agreement regarding the construction of the West German government. The three powers' governments have issued new instructions to Moscow, and the three powers' representatives will ask Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov for a fourth meeting. It is said that if the fourth meeting is still ineffective, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will order his special envoy Roberts to try to meet with Stalin again. This direct consultation is the last effort to seek compromise after all attempts by the three powers to discuss the basis for discussion with Molotov have failed. According to sources close to the British Foreign Office, the representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in London are constantly seeking to know the development of the Moscow talks, and the British government always informs them of the details.

### The Soviet Union Attempts to Dominate Berlin; Creates Chaotic Situation as a Pretext for Military Intervention; Western Allies Deeply Fear the Soviets Will Cut Off Telephone and Telegraph Lines

[United Press, Berlin, 12th Dispatch] The Berlin "Telegraph," registered in the United Kingdom, stated on the 12th that the Soviet military authorities are attempting to create a confusing situation in order to make the Soviet Union's military intervention in Berlin justifiable. The newspaper stated that the Soviet Union's ultimate goal "is to dominate all of Berlin alone. To achieve this goal, a large number of Communist Party members have taken high positions, and the Soviet side has instigated the sabotage of the city government. They believe that this strategy, coupled with the blockade, can create a confusing situation and be used as a pretext for military intervention."

At the same time, Soviet-registered newspapers demanded the overthrow of the city council and the merger of the entire city with the Soviet occupation zone. Due to the mutual slander between the newspapers under the Western and Soviet systems, the relationship between the East and West has fallen to its lowest ebb since the start of the Kremlin talks. What is noteworthy is that this development coincided with reports from London that the East-West negotiations had reached a deadlock. Therefore, although the four powers started negotiations two weeks ago, they are still as deadlocked as they were before they started.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th, United Press Dispatch] Allied authorities are deeply concerned that the Soviet Union may one day cut off the telephone and telegraph lines between Berlin and the Western occupation zones, forcing the Western Allies to use only radio to communicate with their occupation zones. The German news agency, permitted by the Soviet side, claimed that the US military had cut off three main power lines leading to the Soviet zone. The US authorities were unaware of this. However, it is reported that the Soviet side has completed new lines, and it is believed that the German news agency's reporting in this way is to prepare for cutting off the Allies' telephone and telegraph lines.

### Financial "Counter-Blockade"

The Western Allies have also launched an attack on the Soviet Union, launching a financial "counter-blockade," prohibiting German banks in the Western zones from sending funds to the Soviet zone of Berlin. This is to counter the Soviet Union's attempt to force the entire city of Berlin to accept Soviet financial regulations. The headquarters of each bank are in the Soviet occupation zone.

### Large Number of New Soviet Troops to Be Stationed in Germany

[United Press, Berlin, 12th Dispatch] News that the Soviet army will send a large number of new troops to Germany has prompted a general mobilization of propaganda, and the deterioration of East-West relations has reached a new record. The British-registered Berlin "Telegraph" stated that the clothing factories in Mecklenburg have an accumulation of orders to make clothes for the new Soviet army that is about to come to Germany. Soviet newspapers condemned the West and demanded the abolition of the city council, and Western newspapers have launched a counterattack.

[United Press, Helmstedt, 11th Dispatch] Refugees from the Soviet occupation zone of Germany said that all German men between the ages of 18 and 30 are now ordered to register with the Soviet occupation forces headquarters. It is reported that those who have registered have been taken by the Soviet military to an "unknown destination" within a few days. The refugees' statements coincide with the statements of German police officers. According to German police officers, the strength of Soviet forces along the US-Soviet occupation zone border has "increased greatly." It is reported that it is believed that 100,000 to 200,000 Soviet troops are now concentrated in the Machdeburg area on the border of the occupation zones.

### US Air Force Secretary Says Decision Made to Enhance Berlin Airlift

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 12th Dispatch] After inspecting the Berlin airlift, US Air Force Secretary Symington declared that supplying Berlin by air is the most important mission of the US Air Force at present. Symington also said that adverse winter weather may hinder flying, but it cannot stop the United States from supplying Berlin. He also said that one hundred four-engine C-54 Skymasters will participate in the Berlin airlift, and many of these aircraft have already set off for Europe.

### Bridges Warns European Recipient Nations: US Aid Will Be Cancelled if They Do Not Help Themselves

[United Press, Washington, 12th Dispatch] Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges warned European countries on the 12th that if they do not quickly help themselves, Congress may refuse to appropriate more funds for foreign aid. He said that Congress's future actions will depend on the progress of European countries in building their own economies. The first year of foreign aid funds appropriated by both houses will expire on June 30th of next year.

### Malayan Riots Affect Rice Shipments to China

[News Agency Report] New York, 12th Broadcast, Washington Dispatch. An official in charge of the Economic Cooperation Administration recently stated that the riots in Malaya will reduce the amount of rice shipped from there to various countries in the Far East, especially to China.

### Insisting on Freedom of Commerce and Navigation on the Danube River; Secretary Marshall Reiterates US Stance; Avoids Answering Questions on the Moscow Negotiations

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall declared at a press conference today that the Soviet Union's proposal regarding navigation on the Danube River is intended to hinder navigation on the river and place the river under the control of the Soviet Union and its satellite states. However, the United States should continue to seize every opportunity to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, and will continue to strive to achieve this goal, but it cannot abandon the basic principles that should be respected. The United States cannot accept the Soviet Union's proposal. The United States is trying to resolve post-war problems, but is now encountering various difficulties, and this problem is the most obvious.

Secretary Marshall continued to emphasize that the United States must protect German-American economic interests, but Secretary Marshall refused to express a reaction to the Belgrade conference. When asked if this statement also applied to the current Moscow negotiations, he declined to answer, saying that such comments would break promises. A reporter asked if the United States would close the Danube River from Linz (Austria) if free navigation could not be guaranteed. The Secretary of State declined to specify what actions the United States would take, but pointed out that the US representative attending the Danube River conference would be able to clearly explain the US response.

### Franco-Soviet Verbal Battle

First Article of New Convention Passed

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 11th Dispatch] At a meeting of the General Affairs Committee of the Danube River Conference today, the French and Soviet representatives engaged in a fierce verbal battle.

The UK and the US abstained.

### US Shipbuilding Plan

[United Press, Washington, 11th Dispatch] The government began its post-war shipbuilding plan on the 11th, signing a contract to order two passenger ships worth $325 million. Their capacity is second only to the "America." The Shipping Commission announced that 972 passenger ships will be built by Bethlehem Steel Corporation to participate in American export routes, serving in the Mediterranean. The estimated maximum speed of each passenger ship is 25 knots, and the displacement is 29,705 tons. In wartime, it can be converted into a battle longevity capable of accommodating a 5,000-man army.

### Korean Government About to Be Established; US Military Announces Martial Law; US and Korea to Negotiate Transfer of Power

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 11th, United Press Dispatch] This reporter has learned that the US military is stepping up preparations for its withdrawal from Korea, and has begun shipping large quantities of supplies out of the country. Hundreds of trucks, jeeps, medium-sized jeeps, and other various supplies are being loaded onto ships at Incheon Port and transported to Seoul. In fact, the Korean government hopes that all US military supplies will be left to the newly established Korea. However, even if the United States decides to do so, there is still a large amount of equipment that can be donated to Korea. The greatest need of the Korean government is weapons. The government will be officially established on the 15th (the third anniversary of Japan's surrender). The US military has received reports that communist elements will take the opportunity to cause disturbances. The US military will impose martial law from midnight on the 12th to midnight on the 16th. The Korean police and security forces will also adopt this measure. The US telephone line between Seoul and Incheon has been damaged. It is expected that negotiations between the US and the Korean government on the transfer of power will begin on the 16th. The transfer of work may take weeks or even months to complete. (For news about China's recognition of the new Korean government, please see the first page.)

### Bentley Claims Soviet Embassy Secretary Responsible for US Espionage Activities; Secretary Marshall Says Soviet Political Refugees Can Receive US Protection

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th, United Press Dispatch] American Soviet female spy Elizabeth Bentley, who surrendered to the authorities, recently identified Soviet Embassy First Secretary Gromov as the person in charge of the Soviet espionage network in the United States. This allows the Soviet government to participate in the US Congress' investigation of communist espionage activities. Bentley testified under oath that Gromov had paid her money (which has been handed over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation by Bentley) for her work. The Soviet side said that the embassy's press officer was not in Washington and no one could comment on this allegation. Bentley's statements were announced by the House Committee on Un-American Activities.

The committee plans to adjourn this weekend to question three Soviet citizens who defected from the Soviet government in New York and Ottawa, Canada. Three members of the committee will go to New York on the 12th to question the Somarin couple, Soviet school teachers who want to bring their three children to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid being sent back to their country. Another group will go to Ottawa to visit Igor Gouzenko, a former cipher clerk at the Soviet Embassy in Canada. The Canadian Soviet spy case was cracked entirely due to Gouzenko's surrender and confession of everything. Soviet Ambassador to the United States Pan Yu-shin accused Somarin of being kidnapped by White Russians with the tacit consent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and demanded that Somarin be handed over immediately so that he could take the next ship back to his country. However, Secretary Marshall said at a press conference today that Somarin and any other Soviet citizens who wish to remain in the United States will be protected in accordance with the traditional US policy of asylum for political refugees. Lauchlin Currie, a former assistant to President Roosevelt who was accused by Bentley of providing espionage information to the Soviet Union, will appear before the Committee on Un-American Activities on the 13th. Many of the other people accused by Bentley said that Bentley was a frustrated, internet-addicted, and nervous liar.

### New York Supreme Court Signs Habeas Corpus Summons Soviet Consul to Send Mrs. Kosenkina to Testify

[Central News Agency, New York, 10th Dispatch] A judge of the New York State Supreme Court has signed a habeas corpus order, asking Soviet Consul General Lozovs sky here to send Mrs. Kosenkina to court. This Soviet school teacher case has taken a new turn today with this. This order has been sent to Lozovsky this afternoon, but it is not known whether Lozovsky will recognize the habeas corpus order and send Mrs. Kosenkina to the New York State Supreme Court tomorrow as requested by the order. At the same time, another Soviet teacher, Mr. Somarin, whom Lozovsky wants to "rescue," has announced that he has renounced his Soviet citizenship and has received a subpoena to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities this weekend.

### Invited to Return to US for a Visit; MacArthur Declines

[United Press, Washington, 11th Dispatch] General Douglas MacArthur refused an invitation to visit the United States on the 11th. The 24th Infantry Division invited the general to attend a gathering held at Fort Benning on August 13th and 14th, but MacArthur telegraphed the division to decline, saying that he "should be stationed in Japan at that time." The division had served under MacArthur's command from Australia to Japan and is still under MacArthur's command.

### Renewed Conflict in Jerusalem: Bernadotte Orders Ceasefire; Arab League Refuses Peace Talks with Israelis

[Rhodes Island, United Press, 12th] UN Mediator for the Holy Land, Bernadotte, notified both Arab and Jewish sides on the 12th, ordering their armies to cease fire. In a meeting with capable individuals, he announced that he had set a deadline of 6:00 AM World Standard Time on the 13th. He stated: "I have notified both sides that, after the aforementioned time, all armies must be ordered to cease fire. The Arab side has already accepted, but I have not yet received a response from the Jewish side."

After the ceasefire on July 18th, both Arab and Jewish sides blamed each other for the subsequent conflicts. According to news from Jerusalem, minor skirmishes continued from midnight until dawn. It is generally believed that Bernadotte's notification is aimed at confirming which side is responsible for breaking the ceasefire, so that the UN Security Council can take action.

[Tel Aviv, United Press, 12th] Officials announced on the 12th that the Arabs had blown up the Latrun pumping station before dawn, causing severe damage to the equipment. Jerusalem can no longer obtain drinking water.

[Cairo, French News Agency, 11th] The Arab League today responded to UN Mediator Bernadotte's offer for peace talks with Israel, stating that Arab nations maintain their position of not holding talks with the Jewish side. The response was conveyed to Bernadotte by Arab League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha.

### The Soviet Secret Police

— Special Translation from U.S. News Service

The author of this article, Mr. Middleton, is the former Moscow correspondent of "The New York Times." While on leave in London in May 1947, he drafted an article entitled "Inside the Soviet Union" based on his observations and experiences in his notes. The entire article consists of twelve chapters. This newspaper has selected and published several chapters for our readers.

The secret police control the entire Soviet Union, suppressing protests against the Communist regime and managing concentration camps and prisons. Mr. Middleton estimates that the number of people detained in forced labor camps ranges from nine million to twenty million.

Although Soviet rule is so harsh and tyrannical, there are no signs of any organized underground resistance within the Soviet Union. There are sometimes many individual acts of resistance, but they are easily suppressed. There are many powerful forces within the Soviet state apparatus. When some kind of disturbance or incident occurs in the highest levels of government, they oppose each other. However, there are few instances of the people rising up in resistance. The reason for this lies in the organization of the state and the psychology of its people.

It is a police state. The force that holds it together is the MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) secret police. Despite all the Communist Party's persuasion and entreaties, the MVD is always operating this giant and cumbersome machine—in an inverted state.

In the modern history of the Soviet Union, there is no record of reforming the political system through peaceful means. The last reform was in 1917. At that time, the Romanov dynasty, which had ruled for 304 years, was overthrown. Although the Bolshevik Party seemed like a raindrop composed of eight hundred particles falling into the Soviet ocean, it has held onto power ever since it seized it.

Nicholas's Russia and Stalin's Soviet Union share these similarities: a national leader who is revered like a demigod, a giant bureaucracy, centralized power, a vast area of control, extreme emphasis on the navy and army, and the unwavering and severe use of force and secret police.

All trends are aimed at convincing the Soviet people that the atmosphere of freedom that currently dazzles them is genuine freedom. This phenomenon is especially true when viewed through the lens of Soviet elections. Her electoral system is useful to the Communist regime. It provides an opportunity for intense propaganda and generates a "vote of confidence" in the government for external propaganda, convincing foreign echoers that "the Soviet people are after all unanimously supporting Stalin."

Fifth Column Active

The Soviet electoral system reflects not public opinion, but the Party's ability to entice the public to vote. The Communist nominees receive so many votes that no one can surpass them. In this nation of 200 million people, the Communist Party has only a little over 5 million members. However, the nominees are considered representatives of party groups—non-party and communist groups.

In the minds of every Soviet citizen, most are filled with the consciousness of the MVD (secret police) and MGB (Ministry of State Security).

Initially, the Soviet Union only had regular troops responsible for maintaining security and national defense. The total number was about twenty divisions of well-equipped troops, including fighter, light bomber, and medium bomber squadrons of the air force. Secondly, there were many plainclothes agents, belonging to various departments of the MVD and MGB. According to available information, the former was responsible for domestic affairs, while the latter operated abroad. Both were busy with espionage and counter-espionage work.

No one knows how many of them there are. One foreigner, who understands the Soviet Union as well as anyone abroad, estimates that there are at least 500,000 spies in the MVD and MGB.

There is also a censorship agency—the National Administration Department, responsible for supervising the implementation of economic plans. It was this agency that discovered the many hidden problems in the Soviet Union's national industry in 1946.

For the Party's goals, there is also a Communist Party Organization Department, responsible for supervising the implementation of Party policies in government and Party agencies. During the war and up to the present, this agency has maintained close contact with military institutions to ensure that political leadership is instilled in the army.

In addition to performing other tasks, the MVD also operates a Foreign Affairs Bureau, which is an agency specifically responsible for handling foreign tourists. It (the MVD) also controls concentration camps and prisons.

Only heaven knows the exact number of people detained in concentration camps. The MVD has admitted that there are a large number of labor force "employees" in the Soviet Union. These "employees" completed the canal between the White Sea and the Baltic Sea in 1946 in the midst of their busy schedules. Most of their labor is spent in Siberia.

Estimates Differ

Many estimates of their numbers range from nine million to twenty million. One concentration camp "procurement officer" once said to a friend of mine: "Do you know, we are the ones who rule this country." If the MVD organization were added to the uniformed and armed paramilitary squads, it would be no different from the armed Black Shirt Stormtroopers of Nazi Germany. We know that the Black Shirt Stormtroopers had the right to preferentially replenish the German Wehrmacht, which greatly damaged the morale of the regular army and the military orders of commanders based on Party policy. This damage was more severe than military strikes. As a result, the command efficiency of the German High Command was weakened.

It is very likely that the Communist Party has followed Germany's disastrous path.

### City Council to Hold Special Meeting Tomorrow: Determining Public Utility Prices; Residents Not Paying New Prices Shall Not Be Denied Services

[Report from our Newspaper] The City Council's Public Utilities Subcommittee, in an effort to actively suppress the unreasonable and drastic increases in public utility prices in the city, has held three meetings to discuss the matter and dispatched representatives to conduct on-site investigations of various companies' accounts. After careful study, the Subcommittee continued to convene a meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM. Attending councilors included Li Wenjie, Fei Shusheng, Wang Zhuyi, and about forty others. Speaker Pan also attended, and Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau were present. Chairman Jiang Hao, after five hours of review, made final adjustments to the six opinions previously drafted by the nine-member team. Speaker Pan then decided to convene a special meeting at 3:00 PM on the 14th of this month to discuss the matter together and make a final decision. The principles decided upon by the Subcommittee yesterday regarding public utility prices are as follows: (1) Request the City Government to immediately abolish the automatic price adjustment formula for public utilities. (2) Request the Central Government to exempt public utilities from tariffs and surtaxes on oil used. (3) Request the Central Government to prepay or pre-purchase three months' worth of foreign exchange and coal needed for all equipment, oil, and materials required by public utilities, and thereafter to prepay or pre-purchase on a quarterly basis. (4) All oil, materials, and accessories needed for public utilities should be supplied as much as possible from U.S. aid materials and calculated at the lowest price. In addition to requesting this from the Central Government, the City Government should also directly negotiate with the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee. (5) Request the Central Bank to continue providing monthly loans and have the Central Bank coordinate the collection of payments for various companies, or designate a bank to collect payments on its behalf. (6) Starting from September, after the original formula is abolished, request the Public Utilities Bureau to formulate a new calculation standard based on the following principles: (a) The base numbers for oil, coal, materials, and equipment should be calculated based on the average of the actual indices from January to June of this year. (b) The cost-of-living index for employees should be calculated according to the second-period index of the previous month, and should not be pre-added. (c) The total cost of taxes should be calculated as a percentage of the tax rate. (d) The metal index should be calculated based on the average of the four weeks of the previous month, and should not be calculated at black market prices, nor should it be pre-added. Request the government to exempt tariffs on all imported metals. (e) Business expenses should be reduced, and dividends and interest payments should be temporarily canceled. (f) Foreign employees and senior employees should be paid the same as other employees for the same work and should not be excessively favored, nor should they be calculated in U.S. dollars. (g) The base number for labor should be calculated based on the average of the actual number of people from January to June of this year. In addition, please have the Public Utilities Bureau investigate and announce the number of foreign employees and their actual income.

Ad Hoc Motion: Councilor Qu Yue proposed: Please have the Public Utilities Bureau notify all companies that, before a decision is made at the special meeting, residents who have not paid according to the new prices shall not be denied services. Resolution: Passed.

### Mayor States Price Reductions for August Are Temporarily Possible

Mayor Wu explained the authorities' attitude toward the public utility price issue at the meeting. He stated that he did not oppose reducing prices as much as possible, provided that the public utilities could maintain their normal supply. However, he cautioned that disregarding reality and making it impossible for the companies to sustain themselves, leading to power and water outages, would have dire consequences. He hoped that the City Council would carefully consider the matter beforehand and then propose a decision. He stated that temporarily reducing prices for August was possible, but the problem was how to maintain public utilities in the future, so that prices would gradually and moderately increase, and not cause a backlash from excessive suppression, such as the sudden and drastic increase this month, which has aroused public resentment. Regarding the solution to this problem, the Mayor also suggested that the City Council organize a "Public Utility Open Review Committee" to be responsible for reviewing and determining the prices of public utilities in the city in the future, so as to achieve mutual sincerity and a permanent solution. This suggestion was not accepted by the subcommittee, but the Mayor stated that he would still submit it as a City Government proposal to the special meeting to be held on the 14th of this month for joint discussion and decision.

[Report from our Newspaper] Singers Zhang Lu, Jin Ni, Liang Ying, Danni, Xiao Yin, Xiao Lu, Zhenni, Zheng Yun, Mei Qi, Pei Wen, Bai Ying, Pan Qihua, Zhang Ming, Luoman, Ye Qing, Zhang Shihua, Li Xueying, Liang Yuzhen, Zou Lihua, and others, nineteen in total, have formed a singing comfort troupe to commemorate Air Force Day. Led by musician He Hai, they flew to Nanjing yesterday afternoon, and then split into six groups to go to the front lines of Beiping, Jiyang, Hankou, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Xuzhou to comfort the troops. Before the troupe left Shanghai, all sectors of the city held a "Farewell Meeting for Singers' Departure to the Front Lines to Celebrate Air Force Day" at the Shanghai Club. Speaker Pan presided over the meeting in person. Also present were Zhang Fang, head of the Central China Comfort Delegation, Luo Zhemin, representative of the Air Force Supply Command, Wang Xiaolai, Chu Wen, Zhu Wende, representative of Du Yuesheng, Dui Yonghua, representative of the Women's Association, and Xie Renzhao, Tan Yimin, and Gan Simin, Secretary-General of the Solicitation Committee for Comforting the Troops of the City Party Headquarters. Speaker Pan first introduced each singer to the representatives of various sectors and delivered a speech, saying: Recalling the beginning of the August 13th War of Resistance, our Air Force fought against the stubborn enemy on a weak foundation. Loyal and brave soldiers risked their lives and finally laid the cornerstone of victory. Twelve years later, today, the government is determined to quell the rebellion. Our Air Force soldiers are still using their utmost loyalty to sweep away the vanguards of the new imperialists. On this glorious festival, the Shanghai singers were able to resolutely brave the summer heat and go to the front lines to offer their comfort, which is of great significance. Therefore, he wished to express the utmost respect to the singers on behalf of all the citizens. Subsequently, representatives from all sectors gave speeches. Zhang Fang said he hoped that the singers would understand the psychology of the soldiers and try to select and broadcast meaningful songs to inspire morale. Wang Xiaolai said that his ninth and eleventh sons were both in the Air Force in Beiping, and he had sent a letter instructing them to treat all the singers well when they arrived. Finally, Jin Ni, the representative of the singers, thanked them, saying that most of their parents did not want their daughters to go to the front lines, but they were determined to go anyway, hoping to do their part for the country. Before the end of the meeting, Commissioner Fang of the Kuomintang City Party Headquarters and Speaker Pan's wife also attended the meeting. Mrs. Pan expressed her regret at not being able to go to the front lines in person, and specially painted several paintings to entrust to the singers to take to the front lines to express a small token of comfort. Finally, Speaker Pan also suggested that the singers should investigate the actual situation more while on the front lines, and provide it to composers after returning to Shanghai, so that they could create new songs with a new awareness in the future, and broadcast them widely to awaken the citizens who are indulging in a life of pleasure and take on the tasks of the times together. After the meeting, the nineteen singers immediately took their luggage to Jiangwan Airport to take a special plane to Nanjing. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 16th. It is reported that the soldiers in various places on the front lines are very excited about this news and are preparing a grand welcome.

### Fisheries Management Office Celebrates Second Anniversary: Director Zhao Delivers Speech

[Report from our Newspaper] The Fisheries Rehabilitation Material Management Office celebrated its second anniversary yesterday, inviting reporters to visit the ice factory, cold storage groundbreaking ceremony, and fire drill exhibition on Fuxing Island. According to Director Zhao Junmai, since the establishment of the Fisheries Management Office, there has been much criticism from the outside world, especially the accusation that it hinders the interests of fishermen. In fact, we should take a long-term view, because unless China does not want the fishing industry, it must move towards modernization. In the transitional era, the impact on traditional fishing is somewhat inevitable. However, the Fisheries Management Office is now trying as much as possible not to conflict with the interests of fishermen. In terms of fishing, we are actively developing towards the high seas, and fishing bases will be established in Kaohsiung, Keelung, Hainan Island, and other places. In terms of sales, we will try to reduce the supply of fresh fish to the market and develop towards processing. The shark liver oil extraction experiment is very successful and large-scale manufacturing will begin soon. In terms of talent training, we will recruit the children of fishermen as much as possible and provide them with scientific training, so as to guide traditional fishing to gradually move towards modernization. For all of the above points, the Fisheries Management Office has a two-year plan and is actively implementing it.

### Collusion with Japanese in Smuggling Case: Sheng Yu Fails to Appear for Trial, Yoshino Recklessly Claims Contract Aimed at Achieving Goodwill

[Report from this newspaper] Sheng Yu, a retired soldier, is accused of colluding with Japanese national Yoshii Mutsumi on March 4th, 1947, to raise 120 million yuan, falsely using the name of the Sino-American Industrial Company, and illegally transporting seafood, fish, steel needles, and other goods from Japan to Shanghai for profitable trading. The case was discovered by the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense and transferred to the local District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The trial of the case began yesterday morning in the Eighth Criminal Court of the Local Court. The defendant Sheng Yu, who had been released on bail, did not appear because he was attending his grandmother's funeral and had returned to his ancestral home in Anhui. Only the defendant Yoshii Mutsumi, who was in custody, appeared in court for questioning. Yoshii is from Fukuyama Prefecture, Japan. He has been in China for more than 30 years and has served as the chairman of the enemy's Shanghai East Asia Science Research Association and the director of the International Goodwill Association. After the Japanese surrender, he served as the China representative of the Japan-China Fisheries Company and colluded with Li Mingyang, commander of the Advance Army of the Lower Yangtze River in China, as well as Sheng Yu, Liu Jingru, and others, to secretly sign a covenant on March 5th, 1947, to "jointly seek Sino-Japanese goodwill, cooperate to the end, and pay special attention to unity in fisheries and economic aspects," and to organize the Sino-American Industrial Company and the China Industry Co., Ltd., to conclude a fisheries agreement, with the profits earned as the economic foundation of the group. When the court inquired about Yoshii's relationship with Sheng Yu and others yesterday, and what the purpose of secretly signing the agreement with Sheng and others was, Yoshii stated that he and Sheng and others were friends, and the purpose of signing the agreement was to jointly develop the economy in order to achieve Sino-Japanese goodwill, not to conspire in this smuggling "minor matter." Regarding the smuggling part, he claimed that he only introduced Ueno to Liu Jingru and others, and did not participate in the transaction. The court held that it was necessary to wait for Sheng Yu to appear in court before the case could be clarified, and ordered the guarantor to urge Sheng Yu to appear in court as soon as possible, and rescheduled the trial.

### Cultural Circles in the City Issue Declaration for the 11th Anniversary of "August 13th"

Today is the 11th anniversary of "August 13th." We are all colleagues in the cultural and educational circles, and the place where we reside and work is Shanghai, the site of the "August 13th" Incident. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we would like to offer this humble contribution to people at home and abroad on this memorable and moving day, based on the perceptions of our colleagues:

When we mention "August 13th," the first thing that comes to mind is the firm decision and wise leadership of the supreme military commander at the time, today's President Chiang Kai-shek, as well as the bravery and sacrifice of the soldiers who fought in the Battle of Shanghai, and the willingness of all the people of this city to sacrifice and overcome difficulties, united in their hatred of the enemy, and jointly support this great national war. We believe that not only today do we hold this great historical fact in high esteem, but even after thousands of years, every time this sacred anniversary comes around, our children and grandchildren will forever remember the martyrs and pay them homage.

When we commemorate "August 13th" today, we should all ask ourselves: Has the blood debt of "August 13th" been cleared? And how do we ensure that there will be no second "August 13th" happening now or in the future? Looking at it from this realistic point of view, the first thing we notice is naturally our opponent at the time of "August 13th," the former enemy state of Japan, with whom we fought bloodily for eight years.

Regarding Japan, the Allied leaders expressed a very clear attitude in the Potsdam Declaration: First, "the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated forever." Second, "We do not intend to enslave the Japanese people." It also solemnly pointed out: "Japan will be permitted to maintain only such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparation in kind, but not such as would enable her to re-arm for war." All of this not only shows the attitude of the Allied leaders, but can also be said to fully represent the opinions of the vast majority of the Chinese people. The Chinese people traditionally emphasize "forgiveness" and advocate "turning enemies into friends" and "leniency." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they always identified the Japanese militarists as the enemy and only had compassion for the Japanese people who were deceived and coerced, and had no resentment. Now that the Japanese militarists have fallen and Japan is under the control of the Allied United States, it can be said that the vast majority of the Chinese people have neither thought of revenge nor intend to enslave or destroy. However, in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese military and civilians suffered no less than 20 million casualties, and the value of public and private losses was no less than hundreds of billions of US dollars. This blood debt should, of course, be taken from Japan as reparations. However, the issue of Japanese reparations has been delayed until now, and it is said that the reparations in kind that our country should have priority in obtaining will gradually decrease from an estimated value of 2 billion US dollars to almost nothing. We must know that during the period when China's internal chaos has not yet been quelled, in order to solve the difficulties of the national finance and national economy, instead of merely hoping for US aid, we should focus on striving for the Japanese reparations in kind that we deserve. We are, of course, based on the compassion of mankind and are concerned about the lives of the Japanese people after the war, but on the 11th anniversary of "August 13th," we are still unable to obtain the reparations that our country deserves, and we are still unable to determine the outline of the peace treaty with Japan, which is really infuriating! We should remind the government authorities and the Allied leaders to resolve this issue rationally as soon as possible.

Secondly, the only worry and fear of the Chinese people is whether Japanese militarism will be revived? Will Japan once again become a force to invade China? We want to be assured that Japan will never rise up and invade again. We want to gain the "sense of security" that "August 13th" will never happen again!

Let us analyze this point fairly: Whether Japan can rise again depends on two things: one is its industrial economy, and the other is its military power.

First, in terms of the industrial economy: According to the spokesman of the US political consultant in Japan, "Japan's current production is about 40% of the average level from 1930 to 1934." Furthermore, according to the more detailed information we have directly obtained, taking the average number of Japan from 1930-34, the so-called "pre-war standard," as the benchmark, Japan's highest production peak was in 1941, when it was 210.5% of the "pre-war standard," and last year it was 40.9% of the "pre-war standard." Although it has increased this year, it is at most only 49%. The Far Eastern Commission includes representatives from various Allied countries, including Soviet representatives. We can all believe that the Soviet Union's determination to prevent Japan from rising again is no less than that of China, and the output of important products in Japan's steel and chemical industries is still far below the committee's limit. Therefore, we believe that Japan's current industrial production is still far from being self-sufficient, let alone rising to invade again?

Secondly, in terms of military strength: It has been strictly stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement that Japan must not rearm. The later issues of retaining and maintaining a portion of military ports and airports have been stated by the spokesman of the US political adviser in Japan as being for the use of Allied warships and aircraft transiting to support the occupation, and will not be handed over to Japan at the end of the occupation. As for the "Maritime Safety Agency" that the Allied Headquarters has allowed to be established, with 38 destroyers, it has also caused great unease among people; but according to the facts, these destroyers bear the responsibility of preventing smuggling and maintaining lighthouses. The number cannot be said to be large, and moreover, these include 10 ships of 81 tons and 28 ships of 78 tons. The hull is only 87 feet long, and the speed is only about 10 knots, and at the same time there is no armament. Naturally, after eight years of bloody resistance against Japan, the Chinese people have suffered endless pain. We have reason to fear Japan's rise again, and we have the right to demand that the Allied United States, which is controlling Japan, prevent Japan's rise again. But until today, in all fairness, we cannot think that Japan has the conditions for rising again, nor can we assert that the United States is already supporting Japan's rise again.

Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that the United States government and the public will not ignore the importance of China in stabilizing the world and ensuring the future of human peace, increase their vigilance against the latent militarist undercurrents in Japan, and always properly implement the policy towards Japan in the Potsdam Declaration, holding onto the greatest force for stabilizing East Asia, which is Sino-US friendship; on the other hand, we need to point out a serious crisis.

It is obvious that, judging from various facts, the problem of Japan's rise is not as serious in the near future as some people claim. Why do these people with ulterior motives deliberately exaggerate its seriousness? In our opinion, the first hope of these people with ulterior motives is to use domestic and foreign public opinion to pressure the US government, so that the United States will be wary of providing assistance to Japan, so as to create hunger in Japan, so that international communist forces can enter Japan and take advantage of the situation. The second hope is to use "anti-support for Japan" as a bridge to transition to "anti-Americanism," so as to affect the feelings between the Chinese and American people and alienate the friendship between the United States and China. Because it is the established policy of the Communist International to undermine US aid to various countries, so as to deepen the post-war economic crisis in various countries around the world, so that international communist forces can easily develop, and it is also doing the same in China. They hope to use this topic to incite the Chinese people's dislike of the United States, cause misunderstandings between the two countries, weaken US aid to China, so that China's post-war reconstruction work will be more difficult, the economic situation will be worse, and reconstruction from the ruins will become impossible, and eventually become another victim of international communist forces.

In fact, this is the real crisis in the future! On the 11th anniversary of "August 13th," we have to painfully describe this extremely dark prospect to people at home and abroad at this time of "people's aversion to chaos," that is, it is not absolutely impossible for the second "August 13th" to happen before us, although this "August 13th" will not be here but there.

If we still have memories, then we should remember that the prelude to "August 13th" was "September 18th." "August 13th" was just a turning point from one stage to another. "September 18th" was the real beginning of a war of aggression. Let us see what the situation is today in the place where "September 18th" happened—the Northeast? Who is in the hands of Lushun? Who is in the hands of Dalian? Who is in the hands of most of the land in the Northeast? Who is in the hands of the Northeast industrial equipment created by Japan's exploitation of the Chinese people's blood and sweat? These facts show us that the second "September 18th" has actually already begun in the Northeast.

In the past month, a "major event" happened in the world, that is, the Communist International Information Bureau condemned the Yugoslav Communist Party and their leader Tito. This document will be an extremely important document in the history of human thought. It decisively and unreservedly answers some of the recurring questions of modern people.

It tells all people with patriotic ideas that communism cannot tolerate nationalism and national concepts. It tells all liberals and moderate socialists that "people's fronts" and "coalition governments" are all broken shoes that will be used and discarded. All the "petty bourgeoisie and intellectuals," "all parties representing the petty bourgeoisie," all the "small businessmen," "small factory owners," "the rich righteous," and even "farmers and workers with personal economic abilities" are all on the list of liquidation. It also tells the people of all agricultural countries—such as Yugoslavia and our China—that farmers, as an important foundation of a country, are opposed!

Therefore, on this most memorable day, we want to solemnly point out to people at home: What are we Chinese people facing today? It is neither party strife nor civil war. We are already facing a new national war with the Communist International as its background! And if this war fails, it will not only be the destruction of the country, but also the destruction of the entire urban industry and commerce and the countryside!

We also want to solemnly point out to people abroad: Just as the previous war against aggression began in China, this war to defend democracy and freedom of thought is also beginning in China, and it is already in progress. The Chinese people are once again shouldering an extremely arduous outpost battle for people all over the world who love democracy and freedom!

Years have passed, and "August 13th" has become a thing of the past 11 years ago, but when we look back on the Bund today, the scene 11 years ago seems to be vividly remembered. The scenery of "Hongqiao" remains the same, and the "North Station" is still so busy, but the heroic spirits of the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance Against Japan have long gone with the autumn wind of the Huangpu River! We look up at the blue sky and look down at the common people, but there are thousands of old people swallowing their voices, and countless refugees weeping with grief! We are already facing the eve of the second "August 13th"! How to prevent this great disaster before it happens depends on the wise men of our country and the world to rise up and make the best efforts!

### Cultural Circles Hold Summer Social Gathering, Pan Gongzhan and Zhang Daofan Deliver Speeches One After the Other, Hoping That the People Will Raise Awareness and Overcome National Difficulties Together

[Report from this newspaper] The cultural circles of this city held a summer social gathering at the Zhabu Road Cultural Hall on the eve of August 13th—last night. The entertainment programs included Gao Yuanjun and Liu Baorui's "Lu Da Buys Meat" and "Solving Riddles," the entire student body of the Xiasheng Drama School performing "Ji Lao Temple," and Liu Zhongqiu and Guo Jianying performing "Mei Longzhen." During the meeting, Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Chairman Zhang Daofan of the Central Cultural Movement Committee delivered speeches, both asking the people to recognize that communism is threatening world peace, the new "September 18th" has already begun in the Northeast, and the new "August 13th" may be coming. They hoped that the people would raise their awareness, and called on the cultural circles to revive the spirit of enthusiastically participating in the War of Resistance Against Japan when the "August 13th" War broke out, and assist the government in suppressing the rebellion. Chairman Pan also pointed out that the citizens of Shanghai today should be especially vigilant. Before the peace treaty is signed, it is only a truce state, and we have not obtained a real guarantee of peace. Holding a summer social gathering here today is not about having fun, but to take this opportunity to awaken the cultural circles not to indulge in a dream of rebirth, recognize the current crisis, and overcome national difficulties together.

### Transportation First: A Crucial Turning Point for the People of Guizhou - Special Correspondent Liu Mengchi - Before the Completion of Main Railway Lines, We Urgently Hope for the Vigorous Development of Highway Construction

[Special Dispatch from Guiyang by Our Newspaper] In Guizhou, located in the highlands, the entire province is characterized by undulating mountains and towering ranges. The inevitable result of these natural conditions is hindered transportation, which affects all backwardness. This is also the main reason why Guizhou is poorer than other provinces. Under the resounding slogan of "Building a New Guizhou Based on the Three Principles of the People," Gu Zheng Lun has made "Transportation First" the most important issue in the economic construction sector he advocates. There is no doubt that to create wealth, eradicate poverty, and develop surface resources, transportation must be developed first, which is the common expectation of insightful people. This reporter will make a comprehensive report on the current status of transportation in Guizhou and its future prospects as follows:

In the narrow sense of transportation: it includes three sectors: air transportation, land transportation, and water transportation, which facilitate the travel of passengers and the transportation of goods. The rivers in Guizhou are generally the upper reaches of the Wujiang River flowing into Sichuan, the Nanpan and Beipan Rivers flowing into Guangxi, and the Yuanjiang River flowing into Hunan. The riverbeds are shallow, and the currents are rapid, so there is almost no shipping to speak of. Only a few counties in northeastern Guizhou use wooden boats as a means of transporting rice and salt, but this is still absolutely controlled by the weather and seasons, and the transportation volume is not large, and the scale is especially small.

Air Routes

In terms of air transportation, there were originally fourteen airports in Guizhou, of which Guiyang, Pan Town, Huangping, Sinan, Anshun, Zunyi, and Dushan are larger in area and can be used. Other small airports such as Duyun and Sansui have been abandoned one after another and returned to the local authorities.

At present, air transportation in Guizhou is subject to frequent climate changes, many flight obstacles, local poverty, and scarce passengers and goods. The passenger and simple freight services operated by China National Aviation Corporation in Guiyang are only a formality. Originally, there were two routes, Guiyang-Kunming and Guiyang-Chongqing. The Guiyang-Kunming route has been suspended for more than a year. The Guiyang-Chongqing route operates twice a week, on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, departing from Chongqing in the summer. The aircraft used are D-43 and C-47 models. The former can seat 21 people, and the latter can accommodate 27 people. Although fares are adjusted from time to time under high prices, they are much cheaper than the automobile journey in terms of the actual situation of passengers, so the passengers are very crowded.

Main Force of Transportation

In Guizhou, where there is no water transport, the main force of transportation in the future will undoubtedly be the railway. Because the transportation efficiency of railways is ten times that of highways, and its transportation cost is about one-fortieth of that of highways, its efficiency is far greater than that of highways. Therefore, Chairman Gu Zheng Lun said: "The railway is the lifeline of Guizhou." Its completion is "a crucial turning point for the people of Guizhou."

According to the government's five-year railway construction plan for our country, state-owned railways will run through Guizhou in all directions, east, west, north, and south. However, only the southern section of the main line has started construction. The Guizhou section of the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway starts from Suting in Dushan County, the southernmost part of the province, to the south of Duyun County, with a total length of 131.5 kilometers, and was completed and opened to traffic in the 33rd year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1944]. In the winter of that year, it was damaged when the enemy invaded southern Guizhou. It was repaired the following year, and now Duyun to Dushan and Dushan to Jinchengjiang are still unobstructed. The Duyun-Zhucheng section, which is currently under construction, is 160 kilometers long. The entire earthwork project was completed in April last year after five months of intensive work by civilian workers. Most of the special engineering work, such as stonework, culverts, and tunnels, has been completed. Only bridges and road tracks cannot be built due to the lack of funds and materials. The provincial government is very concerned about this. It is reported that recently, due to the start of the use of American aid, the Legislative Yuan has approved the budget of 2 trillion yuan for the supplementary funds required for this section, which was submitted by the Executive Yuan for review. If the procedures for appropriation are expedited, the entire section can be rushed to construction next month, and it is expected to be completed and opened to traffic by the end of next year without any problems.

The remaining railway lines that have been surveyed include: (1) The Guizhou section of the Sichuan-Kunming Railway, which passes through Weining County in this province; (2) The Guiyang-Longchang Railway, which passes through Guiyang, Xifeng, Zunyi, and Chishui to reach Longchang in Sichuan and connect with the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway; (3) The Yunnan-Guangxi Railway, which passes through Xingyi, Anlong, Ceting, Wangmo to Luodian and enters Nandan in Guangxi Province, connecting with the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway. The central government plans to build five lines: Guiyang to Chongqing, Weining to Yibin, Guiyang to Weining, Duyun to Zhijiang, and Weining to Zhan Yi. This province also plans to add two lines: Guiyang to Xiuwen and Zhijin, and Anshun to Xingyi to reach Hedi in Yunnan Province.

Nine National Highways

Speaking of highway transportation, there are nine national highways in Guizhou, namely, the Guizhou-Sichuan Road, the Guizhou-Yunnan Road, the Guizhou-Hunan Road, the Guizhou-Guangxi Road, and the East Sichuan-Yunnan Road, the Guangxi-Guangdong Road, etc., with a total length of 2,213 kilometers. Among them, the first five lines are the most important. The Tenth Transportation Department of the Highway Administration manages the East, South, and North lines, and the Fourth Transportation Department manages the West line.

Most of these national highways were built and opened to traffic before the 29th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1940]. They played a great role during the Anti-Japanese War. Now, the Tenth Transportation Department itself operates passenger and freight transportation from Guiyang to Huaihua, Anjiang, Shaoyang, and even Changsha or Hengyang. It also jointly operates train connections with the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway Administration from Duyun, Guilin, and Hengyang, train connections with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Administration from Changsha, Nanchang, and Hangzhou, and joint shipping operations with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from Changsha, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. The business is developed, and it is convenient for merchants and travelers. Guiyang to Kunming is operated by the Fourth Transportation Department, with direct passenger and freight vehicles operating twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, playing a role in connecting the transportation between Yunnan and Guizhou provinces.

Six provincial highways in this province were completed and opened to traffic before the 34th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1945], including the Qingbi Road (Qingzhen to Bijie), the Lusan Road (Lujiaqiao in Majiang County to Sandu), the Guihui Road (Guiyang to Huishui), the Zunsong Road (Zunyi to Songtao), the Zunsi Road (Zunyi to Sinan), and the Guikai Road (Guiyang to Kaiyang), with a total of 818 kilometers. In addition, there are about 14 partially completed lines, with a total length of 570 kilometers. It is planned to add about 10 lines under construction, with a total length of 469 kilometers.

Provincial Highway Management

Provincial highway transportation has always been managed by the Guizhou Provincial Highway Bureau. After it merged with the Tenth Transportation Department to form the "Guizhou Highway Joint Transportation Department" in March of this year, the bureau is now solely responsible for provincial highway engineering and commercial vehicle management. Two years ago, there were only three vehicles that could travel on the provincial highways, but now it has been expanded to more than 80 vehicles. Recently, the Tenth Transportation Department was approved to allocate six passenger cars and 24 freight cars, and in the future, the General Administration can also allocate tires and auto parts, which will contribute to solving the "vehicle shortage" problem in Guizhou. Recently, two weekly gasoline express trains have been added from Guiyang to Xingyi, Bijie, Zhenyuan, Huaihua, and other places, making transportation to the important cities in the province more convenient.

At present, the provincial highways that Guizhou is actively building prioritize economic value, followed by political significance. Among them are: (1) The Hui Luo Highway from Huishui to Luodian, which directly reaches the Hongshui River on the Guangxi border. It is another main road to Guangxi and is of great importance to the transportation of southern Guizhou. (2) The Guan Zhen Road from Guanling to Zhenfeng, which is 60 kilometers long. After this road is successful, it can shorten the distance of the Sichuan-Kunming line by more than 100 kilometers, and the terrain along the way is flat and the scenery is beautiful. At that time, the original national highways of Pan County and Qinglong may be greatly affected. (3) The Yaosong Road from Zunyi via Sinan and Yinjiang to Songtao, which is 295 kilometers long, is a transportation line for grain in northern Guizhou and another important road to Hunan. The Huiping Road from Huishui to Pingtang, which is 108 kilometers long, is known as the "granary of this province," and will have a great impact on agricultural products in the future. The above roads have either been partially opened to traffic or the earthwork has been completed. The remaining special engineering projects and bridge materials are being submitted to the central government for assistance, and it is expected that all of them can be completed and opened to traffic within one year.

### Substitute Posting: Food Rice Reserve Certificates Not Ready - Issuance Canceled Starting in August

Dear Sir/Madam: I have received and read your letter from the Shen Bao newspaper. The Food Rice Reserve Certificate issued by this association was originally intended to be used after strict control of food, so that rice merchants could not freely purchase and sell rice without a certificate issued by the government, and citizens must also purchase rice with a certificate to supplement the insufficient amount of rice rationed per capita. Because the objective conditions are not yet ready, rice merchants can still trade freely, so this reserve certificate cannot be applied. Now, starting in August, the issuance has been canceled. A corresponding reply is sent to you for your information! Sincerely, the Shanghai Citizen Food Rationing Committee News Group. August 10.

### Profiting from Multiple Sources, Selling Off: Initial Popularity Fades for Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks initially showed some popularity yesterday but later weakened as many parties sold off to realize profits, resulting in a trend of consolidation. In the afternoon, news of rising prices for non-exchange-controlled goods led to strong buying interest and improved market sentiment, pushing prices to new highs. However, new short sellers entered the market, and rumors of National Bank intervention led to a significant weakening.

In the morning, Wing On Textile started at 16,150 yuan. Numbers 207, 76, 148, 71, and 154 carried over the momentum from the previous day, actively driving prices up to a peak of 16,400 yuan. Floating profits were realized, and supply appeared at high prices. Numbers 203, 169, 65, 134, 206, 152, and 220 closed out their positions, causing the market to decline to 15,820 yuan. Numbers 69, 224, 84, 218, 76, and 148 stepped in to provide support, pushing the price back up to 16,200 yuan. Numbers 216, 181, 206, and 65 aggressively sold, causing the price to drop to a low of 15,650 yuan. At this time, fabric prices were reported to be rising, and the trend was relatively stable. Most holders remained on the sidelines, waiting for the opportune moment, and the market entered a consolidation phase. Near the close, numbers 187, 35, 16, and 55 strongly supported the price, and Wing On Textile closed at 15,930 yuan.

Wing On Textile opened at 16,550 yuan, initially purchased by numbers 65, 105, 71, 76, 4, 74, and 180. Further speculative buying by retail investors pushed the price to a new high of 16,750 yuan. However, many parties had limited aspirations and took the opportunity to sell off. Rumors of significant National Bank intervention and the news that a new short seller had entered the market caused a downward trend. Numbers 60, 12, 74, 56, 116, 4, 71, 76, 220, 148, 169, and 120 sold heavily, causing the price to fall to a low of 16,250 yuan. After a brief consolidation, the price closed at 16,300 yuan. China Textile Manufacturing, strongly supported by number 42, reached the daily limit increase. As many retail investors closed out their positions, it closed at a flat 470 yuan.

Mei Ya, Qinxing, and China Textile Manufacturing were flat. Wing On Textile and other stocks showed slight increases. The prices of various unlisted stocks in the over-the-counter market mostly increased by half a percentage point or slightly more.

Old Car flour closed at 19.5 million, and Warship flour closed at 19.2 million, both up 1.4-1.5 million. Bran prices rose by nearly 1 million, with small bags of bran at 10.5 million in the afternoon. Wheat spot price was 26 million in the afternoon, another increase of 2 million.

Coarse grains were firm. Factories and customers reduced their demand for yellow soybeans. New yellow soybeans have arrived, and the market is stable. Corn and naked barley prices remained unchanged. Green beans had sporadic sales, and the market did not move. Broad beans also saw no changes. Red beans remained at 59 million. Peas were purchased in small quantities by merchants, and the market was firm. Sesame prices were flat yesterday after rising too much the day before. Raw peanuts saw normal demand from Guangdong merchants and were slightly firm at 1 million.

Cooking oil trends were firm and rising, with a highly volatile process. After the market opened, prices fluctuated, but were firm at the close. Soybean oil opened at 13.6 million, fell to a low of 13.4 million, fluctuated several times, and finally closed at 14 million, an increase of 5 million. Raw oil had fewer transactions, but they were all real sales. Due to high prices in the production area, the price rose by 10 million. Rapeseed oil rose by 4-500 yuan. Small-cart sesame oil was uniquely stable because merchants were not buying, and the prices remained the same. Soybean cakes became firmer and more expensive at the close, rising by 6-700,000.

### Qihong Tea Prices Rise

This year's Keemun black tea has been favored by British merchants and continues to be in demand. However, due to low inventories and the fact that shipments from the Anhui Tea Company and others have not yet arrived, buyers are unable to find goods, and transactions are weak. The market trend is like adding flowers to brocade, and prices are increasing day by day. Other teas also show signs of low inventories and active sales. However, local tea factories producing fried green tea and baked green tea are hesitant to produce tea for export due to the extremely high taxes. Currently, there are only sporadic domestic sales, and the situation remains unchanged.

### China Trust Bureau Plans to Restore Trade with Germany

[Reported by this newspaper] Relevant authorities are working to restore barter trade between China and Germany, planning to exchange Chinese soybeans for German production tools and scientific instruments. After discussions between the China Trust Bureau and the Allied Headquarters in Germany, a basic agreement has been reached. Detailed measures will be drafted by the China Trust Bureau in conjunction with the Export Control Commission and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before implementation.

### Domestic Medicines: Weak Actual Sales

Although the prices of domestic medicines are rising, actual sales are weak, and the situation is trending towards weakness. Prices are closely related to costs, making it difficult to lower them. However, rhinoceros horn, Lianzhu, ginseng, raw lacquer, and borneol are all very firm due to exchange rate factors. The selling prices in Shanghai are comparable to the purchase prices in the producing areas, plus transportation costs, taxes, and interest charges, making it difficult to make a profit and even resulting in losses, so people are stopping their procurement.

Huaibull knee, which has been out of stock for a long time, has new shipments arriving today. There is strong demand in Shanghai, and the price is opened at 10 million yuan for high-quality Shen knee, 9 million yuan for standard Xian knee, and 8 million yuan for second-quality Xian knee. Only four boxes in total were quickly snapped up. Whole knee hair, long strips, and fat strips knee are still on the way.

White fungus has abundant arrivals, all brought by merchants from Sichuan. However, sales in Shanghai are narrow, and door sales have not improved. Wholesale sales are even more sluggish. The purchase prices in the production areas are rising, creating an inverted market. The door price for white fungus king is 9 million yuan per tael, and the lowest price for broken wood ear is only 1.8 million yuan. Prices have been weak for two months and are unlikely to improve.

### Timber Prices Rise

Cedar prices have risen significantly, and the market price has exceeded the 300,000 mark. Large 6-inch strips are priced at 350,000 yuan per foot. Lauan plywood prices are also rising, while the price increase of foreign pine is relatively slow.

### Sun Yi Association of Silver and Money Industry Suggests Improving Check Clearing Time

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association held a symposium the day before yesterday (10th) with representatives from over 30 banks and financial institutions, suggesting improvements to the current clearing time. The main points are as follows:

(1) Clearing time is 9:00 AM every day.

The clearing time mentioned above should be strictly observed by all participating banks and financial institutions. If a participating bank or financial institution is absent, other participating banks and financial institutions should dare to accept payment instruments from the absent bank or financial institution, and the absent bank or financial institution should still pay on the same day. The absent bank or financial institution's payment instruments from other participating banks and financial institutions should be presented during the clearing on the next day and should not be directly presented to the paying bank or financial institution on the same day. However, this shall not apply if the absence of a participating bank or financial institution is due to reasons not attributable to the bank or financial institution itself.

(2) Temporary clearing time for offsetting instruments is 2:00 PM every day.

For the four types of instruments—promissory notes, bank checks, drafts, and certified checks—that are not presented during the first clearing, they may be presented during the second temporary clearing time, with the same procedures as before.

(3) The time for other three groups of instruments to be sent to the clearing house is before 5:00 PM.

(4) The time for submitting transfer applications to the clearing house is before 2:00 PM.

(5) The time for supplementing the balance is before 4:00 PM.

(6) The time for returning checks is before 2:00 PM.

In its recommendations, the association emphasized the advantages of these measures. To gather diverse perspectives, it is soliciting opinions from all members and people from all walks of life. Once they are properly considered, they will be formally recommended to the Silver, Money, and Trust Industry Association for adoption. Furthermore, the association strongly opposes the three industry associations' recent proposal to extend the check clearing time by two hours, believing that implementing this proposal will force employees to work an additional two hours on top of their current 12-hour workday.

French Basketball's Unexpected Victory: Defeats Brazil, Jubilant

[Associated Press, London, 11th] The United States basketball team defeated Mexico by a score of 71 to 40 in the first round of the semi-finals today. With such a huge score, the United States won the second consecutive World Olympic Basketball Championship, which is no longer a problem. The Mexican team, besides the United States team, is the tallest, fastest, and most skilled team in the championship. The United States team's 7-foot-tall player, Clunt, was fined out of the game before the end of the game, and the audience booed Clunt loudly.

[France Press Agency, London, 11th] After the United States basketball team defeated Mexico by a score of 71 to 40 and obtained the right to the basketball final, today's basketball semi-final between France and Brazil was very tense. At the beginning of the game, the French team moved slowly, but quickly became active. As a result, they defeated Brazil by a score of 43 to 33 and obtained the right to the final.

### Football Semi-finals in the Rain: Yugoslavia Defeats England

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 12th Radio: The Yugoslav football team, whose tactics are very similar to those of the Dynamo team, defeated England by a score of three to one on the 11th and will compete with Sweden on the evening of the 13th for the world football crown. England will compete with Denmark on the afternoon of the 13th for third place.

The match was held at Wembley Stadium, and the wind and rain made the 20,000 enthusiastic spectators very embarrassed. Yugoslavia took advantage of the wind and took the offensive first, but the wet field and heavy ball led to frequent errors. After 15 minutes, the athletes of both teams gradually became accustomed to this harsh environment. At 20 minutes, the Yugoslav team's left forward, Bu Yuan, suddenly launched a cold arrow from 20 yards away. The English goalkeeper, McAlindon, did not expect this, and the heavy, slippery ball slipped past his arm and into the net. Yugoslavia scored the first goal. But in less than a minute, the English team's right winger, Donovan, shot obliquely near the goal and scored, tying the score. The Yugoslav team was unwilling to accept this and launched a full-scale attack. The English defense was impenetrable. At 25 minutes, the Yugoslav team's right winger, Miseslovic, hooked the ball from the baseline. The English defender rushed out to rescue, but unfortunately slipped due to the muddy field and missed the kick. The Yugoslav team's center forward, Wolf, saw the opportunity and went straight in, shooting the ball into the corner of the net, taking the lead for the second time with a score of two to one. At 37 minutes, the English team's center forward, McEwan, received a supply from the right wing and headed the ball towards the lower right corner near the goal with a beautiful posture. It looked like they would tie the score, but the Yugoslav team's goalkeeper, Lensbarik, seemed to have divine help and dived to save the ball. The jade mountain collapsed, and the ball was pushed out for a corner kick. The Yugoslav team led by one goal in the first half.

After changing sides, the Yugoslav team launched another all-out attack. At 10 minutes, the right forward, Midik, received a cross from the right wing, picked it over the English defender, and swept it into the center, hitting the red heart, making the score three to one. After that, the English team launched a desperate counterattack, controlling the entire field. The Yugoslav team only sought to defend and did not try to score more goals. The English forward's final blow seemed to lack composure, so they were unable to break through the Yugoslav team's iron gate. McEwan once shot fiercely, causing the Yugoslav team's goalkeeper to catch and then lose the ball, but the Yugoslav right defender, Miltoktu, covered and rescued, using one foot to eliminate the ball rolling towards the empty goal and England's hope of turning the game around. In the end, Yugoslavia won by a score of three to one.

### Chinese Basketball: Far Superior to England

South Korea Led in the First Half

[Associated Press, London, August 11th] The Uruguayan basketball team defeated North Korea by a score of 45 to 36 and will compete with Chile for fifth place. North Korea will compete with Czechoslovakia for seventh and eighth place. The Uruguayan small forward, Long Bardo, who is tall and big, scored nine goals and twelve free throws in this game, scoring 30 points. The short and fast Korean team led by 26 to 23 at the end of the first half. In the second half, the Uruguayan team changed its strategy, closely monitoring the opponent while trying to pass the ball to Long Bardo so that he could shoot. When the score was 33 to 29, the Uruguayan team adopted a delaying tactic, and the audience booed.

### Fine Martial Spirit Central Assembly Hall to Hold Opening Ceremony Tomorrow

The Fine Martial Spirit Sports Association of this city was founded in the second year before the Republic (1910), with the mission of reviving our country's inherent martial arts. It has successively established thirty-four branches at home and abroad, especially flourishing in the Southeast Asian islands. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Yokohama Bridge General Assembly and the Central Assembly Hall were forcibly occupied by the tyrannical Japanese, so the association's affairs were concentrated at the Nanjing Road branch, continuing to advance with unwavering determination. After the victory and repatriation, the internal equipment of the General Assembly and the Assembly Hall were almost completely destroyed by the enemy. The association's revival committee members and the first board of directors, Wang Xiaolai, Xi Yushu, Zhang Wenkui, Xu Zhiyi, Guo Linshuang, Xu Yusun, Cui Pingxi, Cui Tingdong, Li Yanlu, Sun Fengwei, Wang Yi, Yang Mingxin, Li Zemin, Liang Jintang, Zheng Jiaju, Deng Qiyao, Chen Guili, Huang Yushan, and prominent figures in the business community, Liu Benji, Tang Shuming, Liu Hanyue, Lu Jusheng, Shao Baohu, Dong Chunfang, Lu Xuzhang, Yang Yanxiu, Han Zhiming, Shao Xiushan, Hu Guoliang, and Han Zhicheng, acting righteously and courageously, donated funds for repair and construction, completing a massive project. Xi Yushu, Chairman of the Sports Association, provided particularly strong support. The internal facilities of the Assembly Hall include a large auditorium, basketball, volleyball, badminton courts, a stage, a wrestling room, and showers, making it the only complete sports venue in the northern district. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 14th of this month.

### Summer Camp Opens: Chairman Fang Explains the Purpose is to Strengthen Body and Mind; Mayor Wu Encourages Students to Study Real-World Problems

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Youth Summer Camp, sponsored by the Shanghai Youth Sports Committee, held its opening ceremony at 9:00 a.m. yesterday at the Jiangwan Stadium. Among those attending were the committee's director, Fang Zhi, deputy directors Li Ximou and Cao Jun, and guests Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Zhang Yi, Zhang Wei, and Luo Dunwei. Three hundred and seventy-four male and female students registered and attended, all dressed in grass-green military uniforms. The ceremony was solemn and grand. At the beginning of the ceremony, Fang Zhi reported on the preparations and explained the significance of convening outstanding young people from various middle schools during the summer vacation for the summer camp. It is to cultivate outstanding cadres for the country with three goals: (1) To strengthen physical fitness: Due to limited human and material resources, not all young people in middle schools can have the opportunity to participate, but the country uses this as a demonstration to arouse the attention of all sectors of society and the government, so that young people's physical and mental health can develop. (2) To strengthen the spirit: In today's society, morality is declining. Strengthening the spirit places particular emphasis on mental health, so as to cultivate a sound mind, develop a law-abiding spirit, and create citizens of the new China and new young people of the new era. (3) To understand national policies and the current national crisis. Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, saying that many people in the country are currently dissatisfied with the reality, and young people in particular like to scold the government for its incompetence. He recalled that when he was studying at Tsinghua University more than twenty years ago, he also participated in a summer camp. At that time, it was after the May Fourth Movement, and everyone believed that national affairs should be the responsibility of government officials, and the government officials at that time were also young people who were dissatisfied with the government during the Hundred Days' Reform. Therefore, how can this generation improve the mistakes made by the previous generation, and avoid repeating the same mistakes? This is a real-world problem related to China's future and future generations, so I hope that all college and middle school students across the country can think calmly and study a proper answer. Zhang Yi, Luo Dunwei, Li Ximou, and others then delivered speeches in succession, and the ceremony concluded at about 11:00 a.m.

The camp's training lasts for two weeks, and experts are invited every day to give lectures on various issues, as well as recreational activities, drama performances, and swimming lessons. In addition, Bishop Yu Bin has been invited to come to the camp today to explain the philosophy of life and live with the students for a day.

Starting next semester, its high school department will add an intermediate industrial management course, teaching economics, mechanical principles, business organization, and other courses. It does not hinder the original intention of ordinary middle schools to prepare for further education, and it can also enable students to learn a skill. The school has already started to submit an application for registration to the Education Bureau.

### Education Briefs

### Literary Giant and Head of the Chinese Department at Tsinghua University, Zhu Ziqing, Passed Away Yesterday Afternoon; Taught for Twenty-Three Years, with an Abundance of Writings; a Large Family of Eight or Nine Members Left Behind in Poverty

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Zhu Ziqing, head of the Chinese Department at Tsinghua University, passed away at Peking University Hospital at 11:30 a.m. on the 12th due to illness, at the age of fifty-one. He will be cremated in thirty-two days, and his remains will be placed in Guangji Temple on the 13th. He is survived by his wife, Chen Zhuyin, and five sons and three daughters, who are left behind in poverty. Zhu had suffered from stomach problems for a long time. In the past six months, due to heavy workload, his health was very weak. On the 6th, he was admitted to Peking University Hospital to suture a perforation caused by a duodenal ulcer. On the 9th, latent nephritis broke out, and he was once in critical condition. At 9:00 a.m. on the 12th, he collapsed again due to excessive force in bowel movements, coupled with inflammation of both lungs. Although he was rescued for two hours, he eventually died. Mrs. Zhu and two sons and one daughter in Beiping were at his side, and were overwhelmed with grief. President Mei Yi-qi and others rushed to help with the funeral arrangements. A telegram has been sent to Zhu's younger brother, Wuhua, who teaches at Jiaotong University in Shanghai, and to family members in his hometown of Yangzhou. Pu Jiangqing, who succeeded Zhu as the acting head of the department, said that Zhu had been teaching at Tsinghua since 1925. As a mainstay of the May Fourth New Literature Movement, he devoted his life to new literature and produced a large body of writings, achieving great accomplishments. In recent years, he worked hard to organize his old works, and completed the editing of the Complete Works of Wen Yiduo in his busy schedule. The unfinished works include the high school Chinese textbook co-edited with Lu Shuming and Ye Shaojun. Zhu was too responsible for his work throughout his life, and coupled with the poor economic environment, he became too weak. At first, it was not expected that this literary giant would die of illness.

### On Self-Help Plans

— Wu Yong

It's strange, the United States today is more concerned about China than our own country is concerned about itself, and the comments of the United States, both in the government and among the people, are more pertinent and closer to the truth than our own people's comments about ourselves. I have often thought about the reason. "Onlookers see more clearly," and not mixing in personal interests is one reason; the biggest reason is probably because our country today is completely shrouded in violence. The people around one, what one sees, what one hears, are mostly violent and erratic words and deeds. You only need to see that any senior government official, as long as he travels to the United States for a year and a half, once he returns to his native country, the remarks he makes at that time are much more sincere and reasonable than before, refreshing the listeners. This is simply because he has breathed some fresh air from the New World.

In fact, the United States is truly concerned about the affairs of our country. Two years ago, the United States was mediating our national affairs, Wei Demai's report frankly pointed out that the mess in our political situation was due to poor human planning, and the US official criticized our Han Chinese intellectuals. All of this is enough to show the United States' eagerness to care for China. Those with shallow views may misunderstand, thinking that this is the United States being nosy, interfering in other people's business, why do we need the United States to cultivate our fields? Some who distort the facts even believe that these are all so-called vanguard actions of American "imperialism." This stubborn attitude is like a police officer telling a patient to take good care of himself, and the patient suspects that the doctor has ulterior motives. To put it nicely, this is due to "national self-esteem"; in reality, it is just "concealing illness and avoiding treatment."

The newspaper reported on the 7th of this month: "According to relevant sources, our government is currently studying specific implementation measures for using US aid to cooperate with self-help plans. Since Zhang Qun, the former president of the Executive Yuan, announced the ten self-help plans, the United States has been closely watching the plans proposed by us, and has inquired about our implementation situation. Especially since US aid materials began to be transported to China, the United States has expressed unlimited concern about the implementation of our US aid-coordinated self-help plans, and hopes that we will use US aid to achieve self-reliance. At noon on the 6th, President Weng summoned Yan Jiagan at his official residence and discussed the issue of using US aid to cooperate with self-help plans for a long time. The US Aid Utilization Committee will also consult with relevant agencies to formulate specific implementation measures for self-help plans. According to relevant sources: Our country has actively implemented the ten self-help plans..." and so on.

I don't know in what year, month, or day, the former President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang, seemed to have announced ten self-help plans, probably when he was negotiating a loan with the United States? After the loan was obtained, everyone had already forgotten about this plan, no different from becoming a historical relic. Now that the old matter is being brought up again, it is like "an old palace maid talking about the events of that year." However, the United States "immediately paid close attention" to this self-help plan when President Zhang announced it, and "expressed unlimited concern" since US aid materials began to be transported to China. This is exactly what people who are "ringing the bell" feel is "deadly."

Reading this news report, what is surprising and frightening is not that we have to wait for others to speak before we discuss "specific implementation measures for self-help plans," but rather the phrase "Our country has actively implemented the ten self-help plans." After hearing what others have said, immediately planning measures, although it is already late, is still considered "following good advice," but as for declaring to the outside world that "Our country has actively implemented the ten self-help plans," and then ordering all levels of agencies to provide "new information" for self-help, and preparing reports for the US to refer to, this does not even have the sincerity of following good advice. I believe that since the Executive Yuan announced the ten major self-help plans, in addition to actively raising foreign exchange and actively issuing large bills, the authorities really can't think of anything else.

I remember not long ago, the people of the country were vigorously opposing others, but in fact, the real common people were not interested in it at all. What they longed for was China's self-rescue. In this regard, it is strange again that the position of the United States is consistent with that of the people of the country.

### The Enormous Cost of the Tojo Trial

— Mei

Last year, Mr. Ni Hui, the advisor to the Chinese judge at the Tokyo Military Tribunal, said when he returned to China: "When the cherry blossoms bloom next year, it will be the time for Tojo Hideki and that group of war criminals to be executed." But, this year's cherry blossoms have already bloomed and fallen, and the former Mitsui Garden in Shanghai was once bustling with activity—but the verdict on Tojo and his group is still nowhere in sight.

According to the statistics of the American magazine "This Week," as of mid-July of this year, the United Nations has spent 20 million US dollars to try Tojo and his 24 accomplices, breaking the highest record for any court trial expenses.

If the confessions of the 25 defendants and 452 witnesses were connected page by page, the length would reach more than 10 million yards.

The US Army Signal Corps has used 674,161 feet of film to produce news films of the trial.

### Stepping on Grass

— Chen Meng'an

Last night stars, this morning wind and rain. Thinking, there is no place to discuss. Who will cherish the person before my eyes, who may remember the words of that time? Playing the broken silver zither, singing the remaining golden thread, lovesickness mistakenly makes my rosy face fade. Drunkenness among the flowers cannot make me happy, there is no evidence of news from the sky.

### Subtracting Words from Magnolia Flower

Unrelieved and resentful, my eyebrows bear the traces of newly drunk wine; the plum rain season has passed, when will the warmth of summer and the coolness of autumn return? Upon entering the door, she naturally charms, her words are hazy, and she seems to cling to me coquettishly; she skillfully takes off my bracelet, cherishingly turning it into pearls that drip like tears.

### Market

— Gongsun Wu

Going to the fair, in Guangdong and Guangxi, people go to the fair every day. The place where the fair is located is called the market. There are jade fairs, flower fairs, and cattle fairs that specialize in selling special goods. In ordinary fairs, all kinds of goods are displayed. When Liu Zongyuan lived in Liuzhou, there were two characters "chèn xū" in his poem. The person who annotated the Collection of Hedong did not know that the market was the city, so he insisted on the character "xū" and wasted ink. However, Mr. Liu used the dialect and refused to follow the custom, using xū as shì, which was also an excess of pedantry. Huang Zunxian's Miscellaneous Poems of Japan says, "Salted salt is more snowy at the market." Shito Keishu, who translated and annotated it, cited Qian Yi's New Book of the South, saying that south of Duanzhou, there is a market every three days, which is called "chèn xū," but did not say whether there is a matter of chasing the city in Japan. The markets in Guangdong and Guangxi must have a period, such as the 1st, 4th, and 7th, or the 2nd, 5th, and 8th, or the 3rd, 6th, and 9th days. The villagers often call the market day of a certain market. When the day comes and there is something to buy and sell, they go to the market. Chen Baisha's poem says, "The Jiangmen Market on the 2nd, 5th, and 8th day, buying hoes and buying books again, the fields can be cultivated and the books can be read, half farmers and half Confucians." Today's Jiangmen is very prosperous in commerce, so there should be no more markets.

### Stalin's Gold Reserves

— Namo

This is the coldest place on earth, the vast ice and snow of the Arctic Ocean are shrouded in a gray-white mist, and the river is frozen for two-thirds of the year. In winter, the temperature here is ninety degrees below zero. Bone-chilling winds often howl, and there are three months of the year when there is no daylight at all. This is northeastern Siberia.

However, behind the thick curtain of fog and clouds, there are people moving. Gunpowder is exploding, mountain-opening machines are hitting rocks, and hoes and shovels are constantly ringing. Guards are scolding angrily, and rifle butts are heavily hitting those tired workers. Here, 500,000 slaves are staggering and working in silence...

There is gold here! There is gold by the riverbed, there is gold in the stones. Strong electric lights illuminate the area, and people are digging for gold regardless of the cold or heat, day or night. Ships full of convicts sentenced to hard labor came, and ships full of gold sand and gold nuggets left.

Stalin made a fortune.

Americans like to say: "We have the money." They thought that Stalin had long been bankrupt. Look, fifteen years ago, wasn't Stalin selling antiques from museums to pay the bills in order to urgently need machinery and tools? Even though he has one hundred and twenty divisions of troops, can he resist the American "gold bullets" with his bare hands?

Stalin has never revealed that he has gold in the past ten years, but in mid-January of this year, the US National Advisory Council held a meeting, attended by government ministers, the general manager of the Export-Import Bank, and the chairman of the Federal Reserve. According to their estimates, the Soviet Union now has about 2.5 billion US dollars worth of gold on hand. One expert estimated it at 10 billion, which is about the same as the amount of gold the United States now has stored at Fort Knox.

This gold is a huge asset in peacetime, but it is a terrible weapon in wartime. In fact, the Soviet Union began to develop this large gold mine in 1931. They called this project "Dalstroy." For fifteen years, the excavation work has been carried out in secret, and even World War II did not hinder their work.

"Dalstroy" was originally an abbreviation for the "Northern Planning Company." In 1931, the famous Soviet secret service agency "G.P.U." began to operate the plan, but now it belongs to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The area under the jurisdiction of this company is extremely large. The Kolyma River (Kolyma R.) flows south from the Arctic Ocean, traversing this large area of ​​overlapping mountains. The Kolyma River basin is extremely rich in minerals, containing large amounts of coal, copper, zinc, lead, tin, and gemstones, and the most important is of course gold. Stalin himself was very concerned about the gold production, and the "Dalstroy" authorities had to send him a report every day.

The Bering Strait separates Soviet Siberia and Alaska in the United States, with a distance of only forty miles between the two. The people of Alaska only recently learned that just outside this narrow strip of water is a vast and secret gold empire! (Translated from the New York Herald Tribune Sunday Supplement)

### Puppet

— Yi Yun

The Zheng Yun explains "puppet as a wooden puppet play." Liezi Yintang chapter says, "During the reign of King Zhou Mu, there was a clever craftsman named Yan Shi who made wooden men who could sing and dance." It can be seen that its origin is ancient. The puppet shows I have seen can be divided into four types: one is performed by a single person, carried on his shoulders. During the performance, the person hides under the stage in a cloth curtain, holding up the puppet and performing on the stage, whistling and singing, and the sound of gongs is loud. Children gather upon hearing the sound. This is commonly seen in markets and rural fairs. The second type is larger in scale, performed by several people. The stage and the curtain under the stage are also larger. Several people hide in the curtain, each holding a puppet to perform. There is singing and harmony, and there are also many musical instruments. The puppets are also more complex, and can all move at the same time. Compared with the single-person performance, which can only use two puppets, and the rest of the puppets are suspended motionless on the side of the stage, it is much more lively. There is also a kind of string puppet, whose puppets are larger, and the head, hands, and feet are all tied with strings. The performer hides on the stage, which is different from the previous two types, who hide under the stage. The string manipulation is clever, and the performance is lively, which is beyond the reach of the previous two types. In the past, it was often seen in various parts of the north and south, but it is now relatively rare. The best is the Chaozhou puppet, which is rare in other places. The main performer is not on the stage, nor under the stage, but hides his body behind the stage curtain. The waist and both hands of the puppet are each tied with iron rods as thick as rush stems to control it. He sings and performs, and is all wonderful. Its martial drama is especially worth seeing. Dancing with knives and spears, the momentum is very agile. The two puppets fighting each other are especially brave, even with broken necks and broken arms, they are still killing and rolling around on the stage, which is very entertaining. The most peculiar thing is that most of the performers do not know Mandarin, but the words they sing are all official sounds. They follow the teaching of their teachers and sing in the same way. They themselves do not know what they are singing.

### The Troubles of the Owner of Hitler's Car

— Translated by Sun Shou

The Chicago businessman Cennas had always lived a quiet life, but since he bought Hitler's personal car a month ago, troubles have followed one after another.

When the 9,500-pound, steel-plated car arrived in New York from Sweden, it was packed with spectators. A few days later, an organization asked him to sit in the car, and someone shot at it with a gun from the outside. They took this photo to prove that the car's bulletproof equipment was second to none, but Cennas was terrified. A sculptor wanted to make a bust of him because he thought the owner of Hitler's car must be a "hero." A psychotherapist wanted to examine his nerves. And a publisher persuaded him to write a book about the car.

Many people warned Cennas not to use the car, because Hitler's ghost was still attached to it, and the car happened to have thirteen keys.

Cennas now receives hundreds of letters every day, and the phone rings constantly from morning to night, all asking about the car. Some people even suspect that Cennas knows Hitler's whereabouts; two visitors offered 50,000 US dollars to buy the car, but Cennas refused to part with it. Several young girls came to Cennas to ask for marriage, but he dismissed it with a smile, because he thought his current wife was "unparalleled in the world."

The car is now on display at the Museum of Science in New York, and the ticket revenue is all used for charity. Cennas is eager to transport the car to Chicago, because the people there are not as alarmed as the people in New York, and he can be quieter.

### Morning Glory

— Zhu Ying

Morning glory is a herbaceous plant that grows everywhere in the grass between the roots of walls. Every early autumn, the flowers bloom all over the ground, in various colors such as red, white, and blue. The flowers are tubular in shape, looking like stars from afar, so some people write the inscription of this flower as: "The tears of lovesickness dripped down from the Heavenly Grandson, and this flower was formed in the depths of autumn." Another Bai Longshan people painted this flower and inscribed it as: "In recent years, escaping Zen is worth practicing quietly, and I am tired of hearing the morning glory cross the magpie bridge." It seems that this flower is also regarded as the Vega star. The Baishi Shanweng painted this flower and wrote: "The Mei Wanhua family has this flower, which is as big as a bowl. I painted the smallest one," and so on. It is said that every year on the Qixi Festival, magpies build a bridge to allow the Cowherd and Weaver Girl to meet, so there are also those who inscribe this painting as: "Once cultivated to immortality, still afraid of water, it turns out that there is not much skill." In short, the inscriptions of various painters are very interesting and thought-provoking. There is also a poem that describes the flower: "What is the Cowherd looking at the Milky Way for? He wants to invite the Weaver Girl to play with the golden shuttle." It feels even more affectionate. Every time I read the newspapers of various ports, divorce advertisements are everywhere. It is still not as good as receiving the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's eternal love and everlasting life. Why is love thick in heaven and thin in the world?

### 

August 1st is Swiss National Day, and the head of our country sent a special telegram to congratulate it. There are dozens of countries large and small in the world, but this is the most worthy of celebration. The two world wars rarely had clean lands. In particular, Hitler caused great chaos. After annexing Austria, seizing Czechoslovakia, and destroying Poland, he swept through Western Europe. No one was spared, including Luxembourg, Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, and Denmark. By the summer of 1940, he had captured Paris and subdued France. His arrogance was twice as great as that of William in 1914. In this storm and danger, only two Switzerlands (Switzerland and Sweden) and two Spains (Portugal and Spain) in Europe were fortunate enough to be completely preserved (the translation of the names of European countries into Chinese is not always consistent, but the long-term use is also interesting). These four countries are either weak or small. Portugal is located in the southwestern corner of the coast, the farthest from the battlefield. Although Spain did not participate in the war, the civil war between the left and right factions before the war also had an international background. The cities were ruins, and the disaster was not small. Sweden and Norway were originally the same qi and connected branches, and their territories were adjacent like one. Norway had been captured by the devil, and Sweden was also threatened in fact, only the map did not change color. As for Switzerland, it is a small place between Germany, France, and Italy, the crossroads of four battles. Only the borders of the three belligerent countries are wider. The war between Germany and France is in the north, and the contact between Italy and France is in the south. Switzerland is not like Belgium and Luxembourg, which are the inevitable routes for advancing troops. Its territory is also a mountainous area, and the barrier is self-contained. Although the economy is affected by the surrounding wars, this world's garden is fortunate not to be bathed in artillery fire, which can be said to be uniquely blessed by nature. Even today, the European situation is fraught with crises, and it is still a relatively safe country, which is truly commendable.
