[Report from our Bengbu Office, 8th] Liu Zhi went to Huaiyuan on the 8th for inspection and returned to Bengbu that evening.

[Report from our Bengbu Office, 8th] The battle of Suxian and Bengbu continues under the crushing momentum of the National Army. The Huang Wei Corps uses strongholds such as Shuangduiji, Daying, and Luoji as bases to continue its bloody battle that has lasted for more than ten days, inflicting heavy blows on the invading bandits. According to news from the front, a part of this unit has joined forces with the northward corps. When the reporter inquired about this with the military, they replied that this was possible but could not be confirmed. The southward army is still fiercely fighting against the Chen bandits on the north bank of the Hui River. The continuing offensive of the northward corps has broken the resistance of the remaining troops of the 6th Column of the bandits. The right wing has reached Huoshenmiao, and the left wing has reached Wanggangzi (five li north of Zhangbaying). In recent days, the winter weather has been sunny and clear, and all three battlefields, with the powerful assistance of the Air Force, have continued to inflict heavy damage on the stubborn bandits.

[Report from our Suxian Office, 8th] Military News: Our strong northern advance troops are currently attacking and advancing towards Guzhen. A part of the bandits in the Hongze Lake area is attempting to cross the Huai River stealthily near Xuyi. The National Army is blocking and attacking them.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 8th] With the National Army launching a pincer attack from the north and south in the Bengbu-Suxian battle situation, the progress of the National Army is becoming increasingly rapid. The Huang Wei Corps is extending forward from a certain place southeast of Shuangduiji, coordinating with the northward Li Yannian Corps, and approaching Guzhen. Also, on the Heji-Huoshenmiao line, more than half of the 6th Column of the Chen bandits has been annihilated by our Li Corps, and its strength is failing. It has urgently transferred a part of the 2nd Column of the Liu bandits to participate in the battle in order to reverse the decline. We are gradually encircling and annihilating them. Furthermore, the southward corps from Xuzhou annihilated over 10,000 bandits near Mengji, capturing countless spoils.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 8th] The bandits on the south bank of the Hui River on the Jinpu Railway front were completely defeated by our Li Corps yesterday, and they are advancing in an arc shape to the northwest, recovering key points such as Xinmaqiao, Zhangdianzi, and Zhangbaying. In total, 400 bandits were captured, more than 100 light machine guns were seized, and 1,000 bandits were killed. In addition, the Huang Wei Corps, fighting fiercely near Shuangduiji, is still fighting the main force of the Liu bandits and continues to gain temporary victories by defeating smaller groups with larger forces.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 8th] Today, our Air Force fleet extensively bombed and strafed the communist forces hiding in fortifications in the northwestern area of Suixikou, estimating that the communist forces suffered more than 1,500 casualties. Our large corps continues to make progress east of Yongcheng. The communist area there was heavily bombarded by our army with heavy artillery, causing severe casualties. The communist retreat route has been cut off by us, and they are currently putting up a desperate resistance.

The defense of Tangshan is extremely strong, and defensive works are being rushed. It is also learned that the highest military commander here has been holding military meetings with his subordinate unit commanders for several days.

[Report from our Tangshan Office, 8th] The National Army's mopping-up operation in eastern Tangshan continues. The 7th, 8th, 10th, and 4th regiments of the communist forces were individually encircled and annihilated by the National Army yesterday, resulting in a great victory. On the 8th, they have collapsed and fled westward from Beijiadian and Shifozhuang. The National Army is continuing to pursue them.

Fierce fighting took place in the north and south areas of Niulanshan from yesterday to this morning. The communist forces suffered heavy casualties and are currently blocked in the area south of Niulanshan, unable to advance.

[Report from our Beiping Office, 8th] There is no major change in the Pinggu Line war. Although communist forces have infiltrated the area between Huairou and Shunyi, their forces are small, and the focus of the war remains in the eastern section of the Ping Sui Railway. Yang Jiafu, the magistrate of Shunyi County, has led his team safely to the designated location on the 8th. On the Pinghan Line, the magistrate of Zhuoxian County came to Beiping on the 7th, reported to the provincial government, and returned to the front on the same day.

### We Request One Billion in Emergency Aid; U.S. Government to Make a Decision; Truman to Host Madame Chiang Kai-shek Tomorrow

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Budget Bureau officials pointed out on the 8th that the total budget for the next fiscal year still awaits a decision on the amount of U.S. military aid to China and Western Europe. President Truman will submit a request for expenditures for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1949, in early January next year. In the previous year, the amount requested by the President was $42.1 billion. It is generally speculated that this year's budget will exceed that by several billion dollars. Obviously, at least temporary decisions must be made on these two foreign policies in the coming weeks, and a decision will inevitably be made on the new request for one billion dollars in emergency aid from China.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 7th] The White House announced that President and Mrs. Truman will host Madame Chiang Kai-shek at Blair House on Friday, with Mrs. Marshall as another guest. Madame Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States is to seek additional economic and military aid for the Chinese government to combat communism in China.

White House Press Secretary Ross announced that the tea party would be held at 5:00 PM on Friday. When reporters asked if President Truman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek had any other meetings planned, Ross replied, "Everything I know has already been announced."

[United Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman's tea party at 5:00 PM on the 10th symbolizes that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will be treated purely as a high-ranking dignitary and the wife of the Chinese head of state. However, there is currently no way to prevent Madame Chiang Kai-shek from raising issues related to her trip during her "social visit," including inquiring about the reasons for the U.S. government's coldness towards expanding aid to China. Observers, after reading Madame Chiang Kai-shek's statement on the anniversary of the Pearl Harbor incident, discerned between the lines that Madame Chiang Kai-shek called on the United States to learn from past mistakes and reconsider and change its policy towards China.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] It is learned that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will visit the "Hawthorn Blossom" Inn here tomorrow to attend the annual Christmas charity sale held by the United China Relief Association for China. The charity sale will be presided over by the wife of Ambassador Gu, and Mrs. Truman and Ambassador Gu Weijun will all participate in this grand event.

### Landon Accuses Truman of Making a Big Mistake in His China Policy; Asks that MacArthur Be Recalled to the United States

[Reported by Our News Agency] New York Broadcasting: Former Republican presidential candidate Landon recently harshly criticized the Truman administration's China policy, stating that it has made a big mistake and allowed the Soviet Union to gain a base in Asia. Landon asked Marshall to quickly recall General MacArthur to the country so that he can report to the President on the recent situation in China. Landon said that MacArthur is one of the most knowledgeable people in the United States about the Far East situation. If Marshall is unwilling to recall MacArthur, then the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee should summon MacArthur to return to the United States and report to Congress.

### San Francisco Port Authority Plans to Propose a Comprehensive Aid to China Plan; Marrow Urges the U.S. to Decide on Its China Policy

[United Press, San Francisco, 7th] The San Francisco Port Authority is considering a proposal to request the government to provide comprehensive aid to China. The original proposal stated that once the Communist Party controls Asia, it will forever threaten the peace of the United States, especially San Francisco and the Pacific coast. The U.S. Congress, President Truman, and the State Department should provide China with the necessary moral, financial, and material assistance to enable it to repel the communist aggression.

[United Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 8th] Congressman Zhou Yide declared on the evening of the 7th that unless the United States immediately provides comprehensive aid to China, just as it aids Greece and Turkey, the democratic future of China will be bleak.

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 7th] Senator Marrow, chairman of the National Resources and Economics Committee of the U.S. Senate, said that the United States should immediately decide on its China policy.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] According to the State Department's weekly report on military aid to China, as of December 3, the amount paid has been $117,038,559.74.

### The Security Council Can Only Sigh Powerlessly in the Face of Communist Actions in China; The Soviet Union's Use of the Veto Is a Major Obstacle

[United Press, Paris, 7th] The Security Council is currently powerless to stop the rampant Communist Party in China. The Security Council's members will express regret that the Communist Party is able to benefit, but none of the member states has any hope that the Security Council can take effective action. The Security Council is technically constrained, but even without this technical characteristic, the Security Council seems too weak to stop the advancing Communist army. There are three main reasons why the Security Council cannot do anything.

(1) The Soviet Union will veto any possible action against the Chinese Communist Party.

(2) The Security Council shall not interfere in the internal affairs of a country, so before declaring that it has the right to handle the Chinese incident, the Security Council must prove that this is an international dispute, such as the participation of certain countries, such as the Soviet Union, in the war against the Chinese government.

(3) Even if these technical characteristics can be overcome, the Security Council has no tools to implement any orders.

If the Security Council handles the Chinese incident, it will at most focus attention on the issue. This method has been used on other issues before, most notably the Greek issue. In the Greek incident, the majority of member states of the Security Council accused Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia of assisting the Greek Communist Party, thereby threatening the Greek government, but the Soviet Union constantly used its veto power to obstruct the Security Council's actions.

### The Story of U.S. Troops Coming to Shanghai to Maintain Order; The U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Has Denied It; The U.S. State Department Still Keeps the Instructions on Protecting Overseas Chinese Secret

[United Press, Local News] There have been rumors lately that the U.S. Marine Corps will come to Shanghai to maintain order. U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Cabot issued a statement on the 8th denying this. The authorities of the American-owned electricity company also denied having requested the United States to send troops to protect it. As far as is known now, the American authorities here have prepared to send troops to protect and evacuate overseas Chinese in the event of chaos. There is no intention to send troops to Shanghai to protect American official or private property. If the United States sends troops to Shanghai to maintain order on its behalf, then it must be decided by the State Department. No one here knows of such a decision or expects such a decision. Several hundred American businesses in Shanghai have considerable assets and would like to see American troops come to protect them. Even all Shanghai residents would welcome them, but the U.S. government has not yet expressed any intention of getting involved in the Chinese civil war. According to U.S. Navy officer Crawford, the fact that the United States continued to send Marine Corps to the Qingdao naval base was initially announced by Washington.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The State Department's instructions to Shanghai on the steps to protect American people and interests remained secret on the evening of the 7th. It had been generally expected that the State Department would issue a statement on this issue in the afternoon, but no statement was issued. A Navy Department spokesman said that whether to deploy the Marine Corps to protect American commercial industries in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Electric Power Company, is entirely up to the State Department. The State Department said that any statement on the whereabouts of the Marine Corps and how it will be used should be issued by the relevant authorities. The State Department pointed out that the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing and the Navy have been authorized to handle the evacuation of American expatriates, but the State Department here is currently unable to release the latest news on local developments.

### Presidential Commendation Yesterday; Posthumous Promotion of Huang Baitao to General

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] President issued an order on December 8th, stating that Lieutenant General Huang Baitao, Commander of the 7th Army Corps, was loyal and upright, with exceptional knowledge and fortitude, and deeply versed in military strategy. Having served in the military for a long time, he repeatedly confronted formidable enemies in the War of Resistance Against Japan and campaigns against bandits. He also participated in military planning, making outstanding contributions. He progressed through the ranks from regimental and brigade commander to war zone chief of staff, eventually assuming his current position. During the Xuzhou Campaign, the communists mobilized all their forces to disrupt the areas along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. Commander Huang personally led the troops, resolutely blocking the enemy. The entire army fought bravely and defended against the danger, eventually crushing the enemy's advance and stabilizing the battle situation. His contributions were immense. Unfortunately, his ambitions were cut short, and he died for his country. Having reviewed his last words, it is deeply regrettable. He should be posthumously commended by presidential decree and promoted to General. The Executive Yuan should instruct the Ministry of National Defense to provide generous compensation and condolences. His life's achievements should be recorded in the National History Museum to honor his loyalty and inspire future generations.

### US Policy Towards China; Secret Documents Stolen; House Investigating Committee Considers Publication

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Members of the House Committee on Un-American Activities held a closed-door meeting today with former Deputy Undersecretary of State Welles to determine whether to release allegedly stolen State Department secret documents. Although former State Department official Hiss denied accusations by communist operative Chambers that he had stolen secret documents and handed them over to a Soviet spy, congressional investigators are extremely concerned about the potential impact of the stolen documents, especially regarding how they might have aided the Chinese communists in their war against the National Government. Congressional sources say that the committee is highly concerned about the stolen documents on China policy and is considering the potential impact of their publication on the war in China. Informed sources say that the committee has concrete evidence proving that some documents have been stolen and sent to the Soviet Union for use by communists in the Far East.

Editorial

### Protecting Traffic Safety

Recently, due to the turbulent situation, people are anxious, and the evacuation work by sea, land, and air has become unprecedentedly congested, resulting in a series of tragedies involving ships, planes, trains, and cars, causing great loss of life and property. This is a human tragedy and a misfortune for society! If the transportation and security authorities do not quickly control the evacuation, protect traffic safety, and stabilize people's hearts, then traffic chaos will create potential future troubles.

The current traffic chaos is unprecedented, especially the congestion of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou trains, and the overloading of ships heading to Hong Kong and Taiwan, which have already deviated from the normal track of transportation activities. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangya" ship, a large vessel operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, was carrying approximately 3,000 passengers to Ningbo on the night of the 3rd when it exploded in the Tongsha waters. According to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the ship had a total of 2,565 passengers and 122 crew members. An estimated 1,600 passengers and 68 crew members are missing, mostly dead, either on the ship or sunk to the bottom of the sea. In addition, the Ningbo Compatriot Association has registered the names of over 2,000 passengers who died. This is undoubtedly an unprecedented tragedy. On the same day, a plane flying from Nanjing to Taiwan crashed at Taipei Airport, killing 25 passengers. The chaotic situation continued to occur. On the morning of the 5th, another train collision occurred near Wuxi Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai line, killing more than 30 people. At the same time, a long-distance bus traveling from Xicheng to Jiangyin crashed, killing seven and injuring twenty-eight. On the same afternoon at 5:53 PM, China Airlines Flight 538, a C-46 aircraft flying from Chongqing to Shanghai, was diverted to Jiangwan Airport due to heavy fog at Longhua Airport and the lack of radar equipment. Unfortunately, the fuselage struck a mound of earth next to the runway upon landing, killing ten and injuring eleven, including the pilot and passengers. In addition, there have been many other traffic accidents, such as people falling from trains and dying, or being caught in ship accidents. Although these events are unfortunate, they are certainly not accidental.

The direct cause of the continuous traffic accidents is the lack of planning for evacuation and transportation, the extreme disorder of management, and the unhealthy psychology of passengers. The indirect cause is problems with transportation facilities, which fail to fully meet people's needs. If the explosion of the "Jiangya" ship was not due to a problem with the boiler, or to some kind of explosive, then, regardless of whether it came from inside or outside the ship, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate and prevent future incidents. The Navy should have a strict responsibility to patrol the waterways outside Wusongkou and along the Yangtze and coastal areas. The causes of train and bus accidents on the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are mostly due to excessive ticket sales and unplanned evacuation. The unhealthy psychology of passengers is mostly due to a lack of awareness and a faulty view of life. When the battlefield is hundreds or thousands of miles away, this kind of running and fleeing is tantamount to seeking trouble. If this psychology does not change, it will not help traffic safety. In short, traffic safety is passenger safety; not only do the transportation and security agencies have a responsibility, but also the passengers themselves have a responsibility. Therefore, the first key to traffic safety is the restoration of social order and the calming of people's hearts.

The plane crashes at Jiangwan Airport and Taipei Airport are due to the lack of radar equipment at the airports, which is extremely unfortunate. At the end of the previous year and in the spring of last year, several Central and China Airlines planes crashed in Shanghai and Qingdao. This led to the establishment of the "Civil Aviation Administration," which prepared to install radar at various airports and to prepare various life-saving and safety technologies to reduce the risk of accidents. This time, two planes crashed in Shanghai and Taipei on the same day, due to heavy fog, and the fact that civil aviation equipment is still not perfect is undeniable.

Speaking of the responsibility for the repeated traffic accidents, from the perspective of administrative management and social morality, the sea, land, and air transportation agencies should bear direct and indirect responsibility. It is hoped that they will conduct an investigation on the one hand, and quickly compensate and comfort the passengers who died on the other hand. As for the future evacuation, it is an extremely important matter. It is hoped that the transportation and security agencies will carry out planned evacuations and conduct pre-checks and prepare for emergencies. Ticket sales must have an appropriate limit to ensure all is safe. In short, the country is currently in a difficult stage. In order to cope with the extraordinary situation, regulating traffic evacuation and protecting traffic safety is an urgent matter.

### Gold and Silver Exchange Prices; No Consideration of Changes; Ministry of Finance Denies Rumors of Higher Exchange Rates

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Recent rumors that the government is raising the price of gold exchange are completely untrue. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, gold exchange is being carried out in accordance with Article 11 of the "Revised Regulations for the Issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates": "Anyone who deposits Gold Yuan Certificates in a bank designated by the Central Bank, with a term of one year, will, in addition to receiving interest as stipulated, be able to exchange Gold Yuan of the same value as the deposit at the time of deposit with the deposit bank. Before the Gold Yuan can be raised, gold or silver coins may be exchanged at the prescribed ratio." Currently, major cities are handling this matter in accordance with this regulation. The government has not considered changing the exchange price or the amount of deposits. Rumors of raising the price of gold exchange are purely rumors spread by villains who hope to profit and are not credible.

### Zheng Daoru Discusses Mission to Shanghai; Financial Affairs, Food, and Coal Storage, Southern Transportation of Tobacco Should Be Comprehensively Resolved; Military and Civilians in North China Are Calm on the Eve of a Great Storm

[Our Newspaper] Zheng Daoru, Secretary-General of the North China Pacification Headquarters, has been in Shanghai for several days on official business. Zheng recently told reporters that the main purpose of this trip was to discuss relevant matters with the headquarters of the Central Bank. After arriving in Shanghai, he visited President Yu, Vice President Liu, and various bureau and department heads. Today, he read in the newspaper about the gold and silver rushes in Peiping and Tianjin. He said that such problems must be resolved here. Regarding the military situation in the North, Zheng said that it was not within his scope of work and declined to analyze it, but believed that the burden on the National Army in North China had indeed increased after Lin Biao's troops entered the Pass. However, he believed that the fighting power and morale of the troops under Commander Fu Zuoyi were excellent, and they were assisted by other elite central troops. The recent victory at Zhangjiakou gave Nie Rongzhen's lightly advancing troops a head-on blow. From General Fu Zuoyi down, the headquarters were calm and confident, so although North China was on the eve of a great storm, people's hearts remained fairly stable. Regarding the economic problems in the North, Secretary Zheng believed that finance, finance, and economy were integrated and must be comprehensively resolved. The most pressing problem at present is to find a way to transport coal from the North to the South and to solve the food supply for North China. The Kailuan Coal Mine produces about 400,000 tons per month, and currently has about one million tons in storage. Storage and care are very laborious. If it is not shipped out, there is a danger of it "bursting." The difficulty lies in the heavy military transport, and the transportation problem is difficult to solve. After the end of the war in the Northeast, the large amount of sea transport has decreased, and it is hoped that the coal transport problem can be solved. Today, the South is experiencing a coal shortage, and it is naturally necessary to transport coal from the North to the South. The US aid ration for Peiping and Tianjin in December was originally scheduled to begin in the middle of the month. The distribution of rice is a major stabilizing factor, and it is hoped that it will not be interrupted to reassure people. Zheng will remain in Shanghai for several days. After Administrator Hoffman of the Joint Economic Aid Administration arrives in Shanghai, he will provide some information about North China. After completing his official business in Shanghai, he plans to go to Nanjing for a trip and return to Peiping next week.

Caused by Careless Fire-Making by Guards

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 7th] Regarding the explosion at the Nanyuan Airport oil and bomb depot last night, the official did not continue to issue a public announcement today, but reporters learned from official sources that the cause of the fire was that the guards in the southeastern corner of the airport carelessly made a fire, causing the grass where gasoline was usually spilled to catch fire, which then spread to the gasoline and bombs.

### Supervisory Yuan's Commissioner for Northeastern Administrative Office, Cui Shuyan, Escapes Danger and Arrives in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Cui Shuyan, the Commissioner for the Northeastern Administrative Office of the Supervisory Yuan, who escaped from Shenyang in disguise after it fell, has arrived in Nanjing via Qinhuangdao and Peiping, reporting to the Supervisory Yuan on the conclusion of the Northeastern Administrative Office and explaining the responsibility for the failure of the war in the Northeast. Cui met with reporters on the 8th, explaining the various situations he witnessed before and after Shenyang fell. Cui believes that the responsibility for the fact that senior generals and government leaders such as Wei Lihuang quietly left Shenyang by plane on the 30th, leaving the military and government personnel in Shenyang, should be investigated. Cui said that on the evening of the 30th, when he drove through the city, he saw 150 armored vehicles and 500 trucks fully equipped and waiting for orders from their superiors to charge outward. But who knew that from that moment on, the orders were not given and the city was immediately seized.

### Jiang Tingfu Appeals to the United Nations for Assistance in Achieving Korean Unification, Sino-Australian Proposal Receives Majority Support, Soviet Union Submits Counter-Proposal Requesting the Abolition of the Korean Commission

[Our Report] Paris, 8th (Broadcast): The UN Political Committee met on the afternoon of the 8th, ignoring the condemnation by Czechoslovakia, Belarus, and Yugoslavia of the United States' actions in Korea. Only twelve committee members attended. The majority of countries led by the United States intend to leave the communist bloc's condemnation unanswered in order to expedite the vote.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] During the UN Political Committee's debate on the Korean issue today, Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu stated, "Dividing Korea into two, with one-third of the people belonging to North Korea and two-thirds belonging to South Korea, is unprecedented in Korean history. The iron curtain separating North and South Korea, preventing the people from both sides from interacting with each other, is also the greatest tragedy in the entire history of mankind." The Chinese representative acknowledged the May 10th election in South Korea as a "democratic election" and that the parliament produced by the election is a "representative democratic institution." He stated, "President Syngman Rhee's government is indeed a representative government. However, this work that has already begun is currently not yet fully completed, so the UN General Assembly should appoint a new committee to continue its efforts."

[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] The joint proposal by China, the United States, and Australia has received the support of ten countries. In addition to the three countries that proposed it, Britain, France, India, Burma, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Brazil, and Dominica have also expressed their agreement.

[United Press, Paris, 8th] During his speech to the UN Political Committee on the 8th, Soviet representative Malik accused the United States of establishing a police state in the occupied southern part of Korea and attempting to cover it up with "lies." Malik also protested the United Nations Korean Commission's support of the United States' "terrorist acts and reactionaries" in South Korea, and he proposed the abolition of the commission. Malik pointed out that the Korean Commission not only failed to work towards the unification of North and South Korea, but instead divided them and forced elections in the US-occupied area of South Korea. He stated, "Some delegations have ulterior motives, attempting to suppress opinions and conceal the facts. Dulles calmly tells us that the US delegation hates terror, but who believes his lies? Look at how many people were arrested, tortured, killed, and maimed after the May 10th general election in South Korea. Dulles is truly emulating the methods of the Japanese." Malik also criticized Dulles for selling the "myth" of Korean communist atrocities to the Political Committee. He retorted, "Why is this? It is to intimidate those with wavering wills, to cover up the repressive terrorist policies wherever the American footprints have reached. Korea, Germany, and Italy have all suffered from it." When Malik proposed the abolition of the Korean Commission, he criticized the commission for failing to eliminate the consequences of 40 years of Japanese occupation. The Soviet proposal is diametrically opposed to the Sino-Australian proposal, which advocates that the Korean Commission should supervise the early withdrawal of US and Soviet troops. Malik stated that the purpose of the United States' submission of the three-nation proposal is to "enable US troops to be stationed in Korea for a long time." He pointed out that the Soviet Union had requested the simultaneous withdrawal of both countries, but the United States refused, and he acknowledged that US troops may "permanently" remain in Korea. He also stated, "The Americans are building Korea thousands of miles away from their country as a springboard for expansion, and they are enjoying themselves so much that they don't want to leave. The Korean Commission is everywhere protecting this ambition of the United States and concealing the truth about the puppet government of South Korea." In addition to his vehement criticism, Malik also stated that the South Korean police are controlled by those who once fawned upon the Japanese and are using the tortures of the Japanese army. He also stated that South Korea is a "police shooting range."

Zhang stated that the Soviet and Ukrainian representatives' descriptions of the "tide of terror" in South Korea in the United Nations General Assembly are "the means by which the communist comrades of the above representatives treat the peace-loving people of Korea, and the only crime of the Koreans is to participate in voting." The South Korean government has generally not directly criticized the Soviet Union, but now it has "reached the point of no return" and has come out to refute. Zhang pointed out that President Syngman Rhee's government was elected by the people under the supervision of the United Nations Korean Commission. "If the United States truly has weapons in its hands, then the edge of the blade will definitely point to the countries that are hindering the normal progress of the Republic of Korea and will never point to the Korean people."

### Fire Breaks Out in the Basement of the Palais de Chaillot, United Nations Ushers Go On Strike

[United Press, Paris, 7th] A fire broke out in the United Nations committee room in the basement of the Palais de Chaillot on the 7th after hours of heated debate. Although the damage was minor, it caused considerable alarm. Fearing the flames and the potential for the fire to spread, the officials in charge of security moved officials and journalists elsewhere. Fortunately, the fire brigade, together with the fire brigade stationed in the palace, was able to control the fire within an hour, limiting the damage to the room where the fire started.

[United Press, Paris, 8th] United Nations headquarters officials said that the conference room in the Palais de Chaillot was severely damaged and unusable after being burned on the night of the 7th. However, since the UN General Assembly is only four days away from closing, it will not be a problem even if it cannot be repaired in time. The cause of the fire is unknown, but the point of origin was a coil of wires, causing $1,500 in damage.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The ushers at the United Nations headquarters at the Palais de Chaillot went on strike for one hour today, demanding increased wages. They were recruited by the French government to work during the UN General Assembly. Some of the staff at one of the palace's restaurants and cafes also went on a brief strike today.

### Tojo and Other Seven Japanese War Criminals May Not Be Hanged This Year, Japanese Surprisingly Claim That the Tokyo Tribunal Violated the US Constitution

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] According to reliable sources who spoke to reporters: Tojo and the other six war criminals will not be executed by hanging this year. The US Supreme Court, which accepted the appeals of Doihara and others, may take a month to deliberate and make a decision on this issue. Before the Supreme Court makes a final decision, the seven war criminals will not be executed. The source pointed out that MacArthur stated yesterday that his statement postponing the execution is still valid.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] After the news that the US Supreme Court accepted the Japanese war criminals' case spread here, Matthias, the American lawyer defending war criminal Iwane Matsui, stated: "The US Supreme Court justices voted on whether to accept the defense's appeal documents. As for whether the Japanese war criminals' appeal should be heard, a decision will have to wait until the 16th."

[Another dispatch] People from all walks of life in Japan have expressed deep pleasure over the US Supreme Court's acceptance of the Japanese war criminals' appeal. In general, they not only hope that this can delay the execution date of Tojo and others, but they also further speculate on the intentions of the US action. Some even boldly predict that the United States will find a way to acquit the Japanese war criminals of the death penalty, that is, not to carry out the death penalty. Once the international political situation changes, this group of war criminals can be used again. Not only are ordinary people making wild speculations, but on the 7th, Judge Morizawa of the Chiba District Court also publicly stated that the organization and trial of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal for War Criminals violated the US Constitution. Such arguments are not only far-fetched, but where does it place the international tribunal organized by the eleven United Nations countries? The main reason why ordinary Japanese people dare to make such statements is the US Supreme Court's decision to accept the Japanese war criminals' appeal.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Since the US Supreme Court decided to accept the appeals of Doihara and Hirota, the defendants' attorneys at the Tokyo International Military Tribunal are actively preparing to make a final effort for the Japanese war criminals. After learning of the news in Washington, Tojo's attorney, Bluwett, soon rushed to Sugamo Prison to meet with Tojo, presumably to inquire whether Tojo wanted to file a similar appeal with the US Supreme Court. After holding consultations, Warren, Doihara's attorney, told reporters that he had filed his opinion with the US Supreme Court along with several other attorneys.

The fall of Alaska would be worse than Pearl Harbor.

The atomic factories in the northwest and many cities and ports on the Pacific coast do not have enough defense forces."

### Issue of Italian Territories to be Left for Discussion at Next Session

[United Press, Paris, 8th] The United Nations General Committee recommended on the 7th that the General Assembly begin debate on the disposition of former Italian colonies this week, but the General Assembly rejected this on the 8th.

### Philippine Representative to the ECAFE Opposes MacArthur's Favoritism Towards Japan; All Reconstruction Plans Should Be Reviewed

[United Press Sydney, 7th] Philippine representative to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE), Mr. Jaleco, issued a warning today opposing MacArthur's favoritism towards Japan's reconstruction. He stated that no country suffered as much devastation at the hands of the Japanese army during the war as the Philippines. While developing Japan's foreign trade is a natural trend, its people should not enjoy pre-war living standards until Japan has completed its reparations. All proposals for rebuilding Japanese trade must be thoroughly reviewed to prevent Japan from becoming the supreme political power in the East. MacArthur's encouragement of private Japanese trade to reduce occupation costs is understandable, but it should not obstruct fair compensation.

### Shanghai to Continue Rice Allocation This Month; Mayor Wu Guarantees and Solemnly Denies Rumors of Suspension from Nanjing

[Our Newspaper] After presiding over the Food Conference yesterday, Mayor Wu met with reporters at 6 PM and solemnly denied the rumors from Nanjing that rice allocation would be suspended in December. He stated: "I guarantee that rice allocation in this city will continue this month. The above news is absolutely untrue."

Furthermore, a spokesperson for the Emergency Food Procurement and Storage Committee solemnly denied to reporters on the 8th the rumors from Nanjing that grain allocation in the six major cities would be temporarily suspended in December. He stated that he had no knowledge of this news.

Starting in April, the government will continue to supply it. In addition, the grain allocation in Qingdao will also be fully funded by the Economic Cooperation Administration in the future. The spokesperson said that the grain allocation in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing will continue in December and will not be interrupted.

(5) The areas with the most errors in card distribution were the 19th Bao, 23rd Jia, and 17th Jia of Yangshupu District.

### Municipal Government Holds Military-Political Conference, Three Resolutions to Maintain Public Security

### Depositors Must Present ID to Exchange for Gold and Silver; Silver Yuan Limited to One Exchange; No Restrictions on Gold

[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank, due to the increasing congestion of depositors exchanging money, contacted the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China to change the exchange method. Anyone seeking to exchange paper money must present an ID card to be issued an application form. The ID card will be stamped once issued. Silver yuan are limited to one exchange, with a maximum amount of 49 silver yuan. Those whose ID cards have already been stamped by any of the four banks for silver yuan exchange will not be allowed to exchange again. However, there are no restrictions on the exchange of gold. Although the exchange of gold also requires a stamp on the ID card, the stamp is only for record-keeping purposes and does not imply restrictions. Regarding the exchange procedures for military personnel and police officers, the national banks have also contacted the Military and Police Affairs Bureau to handle it separately. It is believed that after changing the method, the congestion situation may improve.

Furthermore, since the four banks started handling deposit and exchange services, many people have been entrusting familiar colleagues within the four banks to exchange money on their behalf. As the deposit and exchange business becomes more prosperous day by day, the requests for assistance have also increased, and the banks are overwhelmed. Therefore, starting recently, the bank authorities have strictly stipulated that colleagues within the bank are not allowed to accept entrustments for exchange on behalf of others. Even if colleagues need to exchange money themselves, they must queue up and wait for the exchange as ordinary citizens, otherwise they will be dismissed and investigated.

### Authorities Stipulate Measures for Military and Police to Exchange Gold and Silver

Chen Daqing, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, recently stated that at the entrances of designated banks that handle the deposit and exchange of gold and silver, there are often large numbers of military personnel with disheveled uniforms, competing to be the first to exchange, which not only damages the reputation of the military but also disrupts order. In order to prevent those with bad intentions from impersonating military personnel, a method for military personnel to deposit and exchange gold and silver is stipulated, effective immediately. The Garrison Command issued a public notice yesterday, stating that those who violate this method will be arrested by the military police maintaining order at the scene and will not be tolerated. The method for military personnel to deposit and exchange gold and silver is as follows: (1) All military personnel who wish to deposit and exchange gold and silver must first come to the Garrison Command to register and obtain a permit before depositing and exchanging at the designated bank. (2) All formal active-duty officers and soldiers with symbols or ID cards must bring various documents that can prove their identity to the Second Section of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Command to complete the registration procedures and issue a permit for depositing and exchanging gold and silver. (3) Military personnel who have been permitted to deposit and exchange money should proceed to the designated banks in accordance with the serial number of the permit to complete the deposit and exchange procedures. (4) Any military personnel who go to exchange money without permission will be deemed as stray soldiers and vagrants and will be arrested by the military police maintaining order at the scene and sent to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Command for strict punishment. (5) All officers and soldiers who have registered must not register repeatedly; violators will be severely punished. (6) All military personnel who hold a permit must have their signature on the permit verified by the depositing bank to ensure that the signature matches before the exchange can be made; otherwise, the depositing bank may refuse the exchange. (7) The gold and silver exchange permit must be affixed with the seal of the Garrison Command. (8) Police officers and policemen will be handled separately by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau.

It is also learned that Commissioner Yu Shuping of the Municipal Police Bureau stipulated yesterday that all officers and policemen of the Bureau who wish to deposit and exchange gold and silver must first register with the Headquarters and, after verification, be issued a permit to proceed to the designated bank for deposit and exchange procedures.

Those whose original declarations are consistent after investigation will be issued a tax payment certificate. The Bureau has ordered compliance accordingly.

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the Jiangya ship disaster relief work, the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association of this city expressed strong dissatisfaction with the slow response of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It has organized the Jiangya Ship Disaster Relief Committee, which has set up legal, publicity, general affairs, registration, salvage, and funeral groups to actively carry out the work. The legal group of the committee quickly collected reports from survivors and believed that the truth of the disaster did not match the rumors from various parties. Yesterday afternoon, three lawyers representing the group, Chu Shun, Xia Gongkai, and Zheng Lin, hosted reporters to report on everything. They first pointed out that the Jiangya ship's passenger capacity was limited to 1,600 people, according to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. However, as of last night, the committee had officially registered over 2,900 passengers who died in the disaster, which proves that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was too negligent in preventing overloading beforehand and should bear the responsibility for negligence. Regarding the location of the explosion, they also criticized the experts who only relied on surface surveys to conclude that it was not a boiler explosion, which is not credible. At the same time, survivors Tang Shengsong, Xia Wenbing, and others presented several eyewitness accounts to prove that the explosion was internal rather than external: (1) There was no gunpowder smell at the time of the explosion. (2) Those who escaped last saw that the explosion site was turned outward rather than inward. (3) The radio operator on the Jiangya ship was also killed in the explosion. The radio operator's room was located on a higher level of the ship, which could not be reached by the power of a water mine. (4) The sound of the explosion was not continuous, and the sound of the distress whistle was unusually short. The ship sank very quickly after the explosion. All of these are symptoms of a boiler explosion. Subsequently, a chemical engineer from the Xinguang Rong Factory, one of the survivors, explained the possibility of a boiler explosion, saying: The "scale" on the inner layer of ordinary boilers is extremely dangerous. If there is a crack of 0.5 mm wide and 100 cm long, 2 cc of water can enter the scale gap and turn into 4 liters of gas. At a temperature of 180 degrees, it produces a pressure of 41,540 pounds, which is enough to cause the boiler to explode. He also said that, as far as he knew, the Jiangya ship was due for repairs this year, but the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had not made any repairs, so it could not be said that there were no cracks in the scale inside the boiler. He also said that there is a "horizontal" type of boiler, which means that its upper chimney may not fall after an explosion. Therefore, according to the fact that the chimney is intact, it cannot be said that it was not a boiler explosion.

The association stated that in order to thoroughly resolve this doubt, today it will invite relevant authorities and representatives from all walks of life to go to the scene of the accident by boat and hire divers to explore the water to see the actual situation of the explosion site, which will be made public to society to determine the issue of responsibility. At yesterday's reception, when the representatives denied the results of the expert investigation the day before, the family members of the victims listening in were all passionate. They all stated that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's measures before and after the Jiangya ship accident were inappropriate, and the relief work was repeatedly delayed. Therefore, they appealed to all walks of life to uphold justice and urge the company to proceed quickly, so that this unprecedented painful lesson can serve as a warning to the shipping industry and strengthen the safety of navigation in our country in the future.

### Some Rescued Passengers Arrive Safely in Dinghai

[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has received a telegram from its Ningbo branch stating that 14 passengers were rescued by a civilian ship after the Jiangya ship accident and taken to Dinghai, of which 8 have reported to the Ningbo branch.

### Chinese Delegate to International Civil Aviation Conference Returns to Shanghai

The International Civil Aviation Conference held in New Delhi on the 25th of last month concluded on the 3rd. Our delegates Wang Zhu, Chief Secretary of the China National Aviation Corporation, and engineer Hua Zhu, returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday afternoon at approximately 4 PM. According to Wang, the main topics of the conference were all related to international civil aviation technology. The main content can be divided into four categories: (1) related to navigation, (2) related to area control, (3) related to communication, and (4) related to rescue. The conference was attended by 48 countries, with each country represented by more than 10 delegates, but our country had fewer delegates. At the conference, each delegate fiercely debated for the benefit of their own country on every issue. For example, with regard to area control, the conference had initially designated South China as part of the Hong Kong control area, but after strenuous efforts by Wang and others, it was re-designated as the Guangzhou area. Otherwise, it would not be possible to maintain the secrecy of any type of flight in the airspace over South China in the future.

### Fragrant Incense Industry Dispute Escalates: Citywide Work Stoppage

### Two Major Events in Jiangsu Province: Grain Administration and Military Service Administration Progressing Steadily

— Our Reporter, He Xianglin

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 5th] The suppression of the rebellion has reached a crucial point. The battlefront has extended to Xuzhou-Bengbu, Jiangsu, a forward position, marking a battle for defense. The great victory in this campaign has further solidified the confidence in the ultimate success of the overall rebellion suppression. Undoubtedly, people across the country today are deeply concerned about Jiangsu, which is also affecting the future of the entire situation in China. In order to grasp this central issue, this reporter will report on the two most important major events currently in Jiangsu as follows:

First, Grain Administration

It cannot be considered poor. Although the banditry is not yet suppressed and the environment is special, the amount of grain allocated by the central government can still be collected at eighty to ninety percent annually. In the performance evaluation of grain administration nationwide, it is considered a relatively acceptable area. According to Deputy Director Hong of the Provincial Land and Grain Department, "This is due on the one hand to the efforts of the authorities, and on the other hand to the enthusiastic payment by the people. Although there are households who delay and procrastinate, they ultimately account for a very small minority." According to the reporter's investigation: the collection figures for this year, up to now, are not even half a year old. One reason is that the starting period for collection this year was relatively late, and the second is because the administrative expenses of various counties are strained, and some counties have had to allocate a portion of the collected rice in advance to cover administrative expenses. However, the military situation this year is much more tense than in the same period last year. The front lines need military rations, which cannot be described by the words "extremely urgent." The central government's orders must not be delayed and must be collected in full as scheduled. If the handling is not effective, it will be dealt with by military law. Therefore, the Provincial Land and Grain Department sent personnel to various counties and cities to supervise the collection, which was not enough. Chairman Ding was also requested to send directors and commissioners from various departments to depart for different areas immediately to supervise and urge the collection, in order to collect the full amount as required.

Grain Collection Areas

Due to military reasons, Jiangsu is divided into three types: pacification zones, those treated as pacification zones, and others. For the twenty-two counties and cities designated as pacification zones, in order to adapt to the needs of the situation, the Provincial Land and Grain Department has drafted provisional measures for the collection of field tax in various counties and cities of the Jiangsu Province Pacification Zone for the 37th year, and ordered them to be followed, so that counties where public security is unstable can have a basis when they are unable to implement the regulations stipulated by the central government. Secondly, although the eight counties and cities in northern Jiangsu, such as Haimen, Jingjiang, and Nantong, have not been designated as pacification zones by the central government, the public security situation in each county and city is the same as those in the pacification zones. The provincial government has repeatedly listed the facts and requested the central government to include them in the pacification zones, but although it has not been approved, in order to take into account the facts, the provincial government committee has also resolved to handle them as counties in the pacification zones. The remaining twenty-four counties in southern Jiangsu, such as Suzhou, Jiangning, Lishui, Changshu, Gaochun, Jinshan, Jintan, Yangzhou, Liyang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Songjiang, Zhenjiang, Jiangpu, Jiangyin, Yixing, Wuxi, Wujiang, Wujin, Danyang, Jurong, Yizheng, Jiangdu, and Liuhe, will continue to collect in kind for this year's field tax in accordance with the laws and regulations stipulated by the central government. The eight counties of Baoshan, Jiading, Fengxian, Nanhui, Shanghai, Chongming, Taicang, and Chuansha will continue to collect in currency according to the established practice of the previous year.

Types of Field Tax Collection in this Province,

Types of Collection in Kind

Are divided into three types: rice, wheat, and corn: (1) Counties collecting rice: (1) Non-pacification zone, Suzhou, Jiangning, etc., twenty-four counties. (2) Pacification zone, Taixing, Huaian, etc., seven counties. (3) Treated as Pacification Zone - Lianyungang City. (2) Counties and cities collecting wheat - Tongshan, Donghai, etc., four counties. (3) Counties collecting corn: Pacification zone is Guanyun, treated as pacification zone is Haimen. (4) Counties collecting currency: Non-pacification zone is Baoshan, Jiading, Fengxian, Nanhui, Shanghai, Chongming, Taicang, Chuansha, etc., eight counties. Pacification zone is Dongtai, Rugao, Qidong, treated as pacification zone is Nantong.

Assessment of Collection Rates

As follows: (1) Counties collecting rice, each yuan of tax, collect 1.2 dou of rice, 0.9 dou for borrowing, 0.48 dou for public grain, totaling 2.58 dou for actual collection (borrowing is temporarily exempted in the pacification zone) (2) Counties collecting wheat: calculated at 70% of rice, each yuan of tax, collect 0.84 dou of actual grain, 0.63 dou for borrowing, 0.34 dou for public grain, totaling 1.81 dou for actual collection, 0.432 dou for public grain, totaling 3.322 dou for actual collection, (4) Accumulated grain is collected at 10% of the actual collection (collection is temporarily postponed in the pacification zone)

The collection of field tax this year started in November and has collected one-tenth of the total amount so far, which is 267.307 shi of in-kind grain. Now, due to the urgent need for military rations in the central region, it is required to complete the full amount within two months. Dou Dayou, the food department's supervisor stationed in the province, has gone to various counties north and south of the Yangtze River to urge collection, and must collect the full amount as scheduled.

Jiangsu Military Service Administration

Can be said to be on the right track. In the past, each round of conscription could not escape the manipulation of "recruit brokers," which led to the phenomenon of over-recruitment. The Ministry of National Defense paid extreme attention to this and repeatedly ordered various military divisions and garrison areas to strictly prevent it. Recently, President Chiang, considering that the suppression of the rebellion has reached a crucial point, issued an emergency call for manpower mobilization, ordering conscription agencies in various provinces and cities to pre-conscript a portion of the new recruits for the 38th year. Jiangsu needs to conscript a total of 12,000 people. The Southern Jiangsu Garrison Area has been ordered to conscript 4,800 people, starting comprehensive conscription and enlistment on the first of this month and completing it in one go by the fifteenth. At the same time, in order to avoid deserters posing as volunteers and wasting local financial resources, it has been decided to conduct lotteries for this conscription and stipulate:

Six Measures

(1) Conscript more and faster, only allowing advancement, not allowing lagging behind. (2) Effectively prevent spies. (3) Absolutely no substitution is allowed. (4) Deserters will be executed if captured. (5) County and city military service associations are responsible for reporting conscription fraud and handling rewards and punishments. (6) Effectively implement preferential treatment for conscripted families.

The authorities are actively deploying their full strength on these two major events, and the reporter silently wishes that this time it can definitely be completed successfully as scheduled, setting an example. Finally, as an aside, Jiangsu has entered a wartime system at this stage. The central government recently announced that Chairman Su, Ding Zhi-pan, will concurrently serve as the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, and it is expected that close coordination between the party, government, and military in Jiangsu in the future is undoubtedly assured.

### Naked Strange Man Kills Child on Firewood Boat by Chopping

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 6th] Chen Guinan, a native of Nansha Township, Jiangyin, has been selling firewood. On the 5th, Chen bought another boatload of firewood, loaded it in Cheng, and transported it to Xixi, mooring it under the North Xinqiao River in Zhoushanbang. Unexpectedly, at around 5:00 AM on the 5th, a middle-aged man, stark naked, suddenly boarded the boat asking for clothes and food. Chen firmly refused. The man then hid in the cabin. Later, at 5:00 PM, when preparing to cook dinner, Chen went to the street to buy rice, and the boatman Luo Decai also went ashore to fetch things, leaving Chen's ten-year-old son, Longxing, on the boat. Seeing that there was no one on the boat, the man grabbed a bamboo knife and slashed at Longxing, inflicting six cuts on the head and two cuts on the hands. Brain matter splattered, blood and flesh flew everywhere, and he died instantly. Decai returned to the boat first and was shocked by the scene, shouting for help. People on the shore heard the cries and rushed onto the firewood boat, taking control of the assailant. They immediately rushed to the local Ren'ai Town Self-Defense Corps and sent officers to arrest him. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, the man jumped into the river when he went ashore, intending to commit suicide, but was rescued and interrogated by the team. According to his confession: his name is Liao Yuxi, 37 years old, from Dabu, Guangdong. He was a private first class in the headquarters of the Youth Army 202nd Division. He came to Xixi last night and fell into a latrine in the dark, so he was not wearing clothes. Because the boat owner did not give him clothes and food, he killed the child to vent his anger, and now he is willing to pay for his life, etc. Town Chief Zhu Zuwu, according to the confession, determined that the case concerned a major crime and decided to submit it to the city defense headquarters for investigation.

### Is Hong Kong a Safe Haven? Naval, Land, and Air Forces and Police Hold Joint Exercise

— Our Special Correspondent

[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 7th (Airmail)] On the eve of the Pacific War, Hong Kong frequently held "military exercises." How long ago was that? Now, seven years later, it has "reappeared" with residents for the first time. Although the authorities solemnly stated that "they will avoid causing inconvenience to residents as much as possible," when residents woke up and saw the news of a large-scale exercise with the headline "Troops Acting as Rioters Attack Police" in various newspapers, they could not help but feel a little uneasy.

This joint exercise of the naval, land, and air forces and police started on the 6th and will be held successively in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories for about a week. Starting on the morning of the 6th, the entire Hong Kong was declared in

A State of Emergency

The battle for Hong Kong Island is expected to be completed within two days. "Reactionaries" will attack government buildings, radio stations, power stations, and attempt to occupy important centers such as public utilities and police stations. Following the battle for Hong Kong, a similar exercise will be held on the Kowloon Peninsula. The battle for the New Territories will be even larger in scale. The navy and army will attempt a landing, while the air force will drop parachutes to drop food and supplies to the defending forces. The defenders of Hong Kong will engage in a "mock battle" with reactionaries who have infiltrated British territory and British territorial waters, and destroy the "bandits'" hiding places.

According to Sing Tao Daily: "The British Army Headquarters in Southeast Asia attaches great importance to Hong Kong's defense issues. Recently, the British Commissioner for Southeast Asia convened a meeting to discuss issues, with Hong Kong as the main theme. Recently, General Wright, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Southeast Asia, came to Hong Kong and consulted with Major General Maddocks, Commander-in-Chief of the

Land Forces

To discuss this exercise and plan everything, in order to test Hong Kong's defense capabilities. This exercise to prevent bandit riots is the result of the consultation and is one of the main issues discussed at the meeting convened by the British Commissioner for Southeast Asia regarding Hong Kong." It can be seen that the Hong Kong authorities' holding of this military exercise is the result of considerable consideration and preparation. The newspaper also stated:

"Recently, due to the continued expansion of the Communist Party's forces in China and the rumors caused by the robbery cases along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, the public security on the border between China and Hong Kong has suddenly been seriously threatened. The Hong Kong authorities cannot but strengthen the deployment of troops in Hong Kong in order to cope with any unexpected events. According to sources familiar with the matter, multiple batches of military firearms and equipment have been transported from Singapore and the United Kingdom to Hong Kong in the past month, including anti-aircraft guns, gas masks, ammunition, and military supplies, which were unloaded and put into warehouses, ready to be distributed to various units during the day."

Some people in the mainland are taking Hong Kong

As a "Shangri-La"

And running here from afar, while Hong Kong announces this exercise full of gunpowder, it is such a contradictory thing. At the same time as this news was announced, the Associated Press correspondent in Hong Kong published a long article, based on his "results of interviewing government officials, economists, Kuomintang members, and Communist Party members, and they all agreed that "Hong Kong will not be immediately threatened by the British territory in the future." The Associated Press reporter also quoted a certain authority as saying, "We know from the last war that

Our limited defense on the mainland cannot militarily defend Hong Kong." The Associated Press's manuscript gave the Hong Kong newspapers the headline "Hong Kong is still a safe haven," which "shared the limelight" with the announcement of the big exercise on the same edition. Did the Hong Kong authorities' estimates go wrong? Or did the Associated Press reporter's estimates go wrong? It is not appropriate to draw conclusions hastily. But in any case, this "extraordinary" step in Hong Kong has been supported by the majority of residents.

### Jiangsu Provincial Police Academy to Establish Branch in Yu

[Our Newspaper, Changshu, 7th] The Jiangsu Provincial Police Academy has decided to establish a branch here in order to cultivate police talent and popularize the police station system. Director Huang has tentatively determined the location of the school to be in Zhitang Town. After the school sends personnel to Changshu for a second inspection, preparations for the establishment can be made.

[Also] The military and police joint inspection office of the city defense headquarters here was established on the 7th and is actively carrying out its mission. Also, the county authorities, in order to ensure local public security, have decided to jointly suppress potential bandits with neighboring counties, regardless of boundaries, and will launch suppressions at any time. The county's transportation and telecommunications network will be completed soon.

### Hefei Intensifies Precautions

[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 4th] Business in the city is as usual. Projects such as widening streets and renovating facades in Western style on Zhongzheng Middle Road are still underway. City defense works are also being actively strengthened. Also, in order to prevent criminals from infiltrating, starting from the 3rd, all guest troops are not allowed to enter the city without the permission of the city defense headquarters. People in the countryside, except for those carrying rice straw, are temporarily not allowed to enter the city even if they have ID cards. Everything is in a state of readiness for war.

### Sheep in the Northwest, Woolen Clothes Protect from Wind and Rain, Mutton Cools Thirst

— Our Reporter

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 6th] The Northwest is China's natural pastoral area, known by foreigners as one of the world's three major pastures, on par with the American West and Australia. Countless livestock are raised on this nearly 1.7 million square li pasture, especially sheep. In Qinghai, Xinjiang, and the Amdo Tibetan area, the number of sheep is so large that it cannot be counted, and they are counted in groups. According to surveys: Xinjiang has 9,828,378 sheep and 2,437,699 goats, totaling 12,266,077. (Statistics from the Northwest Geological Survey Institute) Gansu has 3,758,834 sheep and 1,219,019 goats, totaling 4,977,853. (Zhang Xin-yi: Estimates of Agricultural Conditions in Gansu Province) Although there are no recent statistics on sheep in Suiyuan and Ningxia provinces, according to old data, it is estimated that the seven banners of the Yikezhao League in Suiyuan alone have 1,330,000 sheep. It can also be imagined how many sheep they have. However, the

Total

How many sheep are there in China? There are still no accurate statistics to date. Over the years, government agencies, organizations, and private investigation reports have varied greatly, making them difficult to believe. According to rough estimates, there are approximately 45 million sheep, of which three-quarters are in the Northwest provinces and the remaining one-quarter are distributed in the mainland. If we look at the special books on Chinese wool, according to the common saying that "wool comes from the sheep," we can obtain the following statistics:

Production Area Production Volume Percentage

Outer Mongolia 144,000 dan 22.9

Ningxia, Suiyuan 47,200 dan 9.1

Chahar, Rehe 45,750 dan 7.5

Qinghai 71,500 dan 11.4

Gansu, Xinjiang 160,260 dan 25.4

Other Provinces 151,290 dan 24.0

Total 630,000 dan 100.0

From this, we can see how developed sheep farming is in the Northwest.

Due to the terrain, climate, and vast area of the Northwest, and the many grasslands, everywhere between the great mountains and seas, on the plateaus and plains, and in the green forests, there are natural and excellent

Pastures. Taking the Qilian Mountains of Gansu as an example, this kind of pasture with abundant water and grass stretches for three thousand li. On the boundless green grassland, mixed with the scattered wildflowers, there are moving white, black, or yellow things, which are herds of cattle, horses, and sheep. Near the small rivers, you can also see wisps of green smoke rising in the wind, which are the tents of the herders. Occasionally, a burst of high-pitched and heroic mountain songs floats from afar, which is a shepherdess expressing her youthful emotions.

We always think that nomadic peoples live by moving with the water and grass, but this situation is no longer very common. In places where there are many people engaged in animal husbandry, each family's pasture has a certain area, and they do not infringe on each other. In the summer, because the pasture is lush, this boundary can be more liberal. After shearing the wool in the summer, in order to protect their own pasture for winter use, each family leads their sheep to the public pasture on the mountain for a period of time. When the autumn wind blows the grass on the border yellow, they return to their own pasture to spend a long winter. At this time, each family carefully protects its own pasture and does not allow others to infringe on it. If someone crosses the boundary to graze, they will defend this source of life without fear of bloodshed.

### Lu'an in Anhui Builds Fortified Villages, Checkpoints Set Up at Five City Gates

— Our Special Correspondent

[Our Newspaper, Lu'an, 5th] The city has a strong military force, and checkpoints are set up at all five city gates. All public and educational personnel wear symbolic badges, and the public must have ID cards, otherwise, they are not allowed to enter the city. Since the price limits were lifted, various goods have appeared one after another in the city, with a dazzling array and beautiful scenery, which has restored the normal state before "August 19th". The commercial market on Gulou North-South Street in the city is gradually becoming prosperous. Recently, the county government, following the order of the Pacification Zone, built security villages in order to consolidate city defense and public security, and each agency, group, and organization committee is specifically responsible for handling it. There is a New New Club at Dajingguai in the city. The opening time is from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM every day. After the play, a curfew is implemented. Officials of various agencies and groups are able to work on time without interruption, and their morale is quite good. There are county middle schools, Haifeng Girls' Middle School, Chongyi Private Middle School, Rongyang Private Middle School, County Zhongzheng Elementary School, Township Elementary School, and Bao Elementary School in the city. There is the County Jian Normal School and Provincial Lu'an Middle School and Provincial Lihuang Middle School outside the city. The school spirit is pure and the students have a strong atmosphere for studying. When there are grand gatherings, there are about 2,000 middle and elementary school students participating, and they are full of vigor. The countryside is still considered peaceful, but in areas such as Zhangjiadian, Maotanchang, Nanguanting, Xilianghekou, Dushan, and Shipodian, bandit troops appear from time to time, numbering only a few hundred or a thousand or so. When our army arrives to pursue and suppress them, the bandits flee far away at the sight of the wind. Rumors that Lu'an is tense are not true.

Recently, commodity prices in the city have been rising endlessly. Superior cooked rice costs 114 yuan per shi, which is slightly lower than before. Firewood is 14 yuan per dan, sesame oil is 5.5 yuan per catty, salt is 4 yuan per catty, and pork is 6 yuan per catty. Other daily necessities have risen to fourteen or fifteen times the price limit before "August 19th". Farmers, workers, and merchants are unaffected by the rising tide because wages are calculated in grain and bartered for real goods. However, ordinary salaried people are all crying out in pain, not only unable to support themselves, but even unable to get their fill all day long. It is heard that the County Council and the County Government are discussing ways to increase revenue in order to increase the salaries of public and educational personnel.

### Hechou Records Progress and Defense Headquarters

[Our Newspaper, Jiaxing, 6th] The First District Commissioner invited the heads of the county's military, government, party, and counselors to a meeting on the 6th. In order to ensure the public security of the urban area, it was decided to establish a city defense headquarters, with Wang Lizhong, captain of the 11th Traffic Police Corps, concurrently serving as commander, and Chen Honglu, deputy commander of the commissioner's office, and Pan Zhenqiu, county magistrate, concurrently serving as deputy commanders. It was decided to convene a meeting of the heads of various agencies on a regular basis to determine the date of establishment and equipment, etc.

[Also] In order to strengthen contact, the chambers of commerce of various counties and towns in the Jia area held a meeting in He on the 6th. More than ten chairmen of the chambers of commerce of counties and towns attended the meeting and decided: (1) The National Tax Bureau often extracts account books from merchants, which often leads to misunderstandings. In the future, it should be handled jointly with the chamber of commerce. (2) A meeting should be held in He once a month. (3) The business tax should not be subject to other taxes and surcharges, and the tax rate should be adjusted according to the index, which is unbearable. Efforts should be made to argue with the authorities separately. (4) The tax bureau has exceeded the legal provisions for the income tax of temporary merchants. Notify various industries to collect information and submit it to relevant authorities for efforts to argue.

### Miracle: Using Stones as Coal – Shale in Dihua: Inexhaustible

[Our Dihua Correspondent, 5th] The Heavenly Mountains are covered in snow, the cold wind pierces the bone. In this season of coal shortage, the weather seems especially cold. The electric lights flicker on and off, the bathrooms are frigid, the daily newspaper is published late in the evening, factories are constantly shutting down, and schools, unable to bear the cold, are preparing to start winter vacation early. The provincial government has tried its best to alleviate the coal problem, but the quantity is naturally insufficient. Schools are dispersing boarding students, hoping to save the coal used in the dormitories to support the classrooms for a few more days. Their efforts are truly commendable.

According to the government, the severe coal shortage this winter is simply due to transportation difficulties. The coal production in Dihua not only suffices for the local area, but can also supply Changji, Gandeh, and other counties. The main reason for the panic is the transportation problem: although the Badaowan Coal Mine is only a few dozen kilometers from the city, large carts are unwilling to go there because the cost of fodder is too high, and automobiles are afraid to go there because the roads are rugged. As a result, the market supply and demand are imbalanced, and as the price of coal rises, everything else is affected, people are restless, and there is endless desolation!

Truly, "where the shade of flowers covers the ground, one suspects there is no road, but the stone path through the clouds reveals another world." A soldier from the Ninth Horse Transport Team in Old Manchu City, while burning firewood at the foot of Yaomo Mountain, suddenly discovered that the stones were burning. This "miracle" quickly spread to the ears of nearby residents. The residents at the foot of Yaomo Mountain are mostly poor people who have no money to buy coal. Hearing that there was this kind of stone that cost no money and could replace coal, why not go and enthusiastically dig some to bring back for warmth? So some carried small baskets, some carried headscarves, and some even drove large carts, marching in a grand procession to dig the cost-free coal stones.

These stones are oil shale, and they are being mined in the area near Yaomo Mountain with air-raid shelters. Oil shale is a layer of thin, black flakes, as if saturated with oil, and very easy to ignite. It burns long and hot, but it has a strange smell when burned, and it remains an undeformed stone even after burning.

After hearing about this "miracle," the Geological Survey sent seven or eight technicians early the next morning to mine several tens of kilograms of oil shale for combustion tests. The conclusion was that oil shale not only has stronger heat than coal, but also has a long-lasting flame, lasting for about an hour. Each time, only a small amount needs to be added. However, special care should be taken when burning, as the odor produced is not suitable for breathing.

Oil shale is an important industrial raw material for extracting kerosene and diesel. Geologists all know to use it for distilling oils. This summer, the Geological Survey discovered a large amount of oil shale in the suburbs of Dihua. After testing, the oil quality was not good, and they did not bother with it anymore. Now that people have inadvertently discovered a new use for it, giving it a chance to rise again, it is quite a meaningful thing.

In recent days, regardless of whether it is sunny, cloudy, windy, or snowy, people have been constantly going to mine and transport oil shale. Even the small donkeys that used to shuttle back and forth on the Badaowan road transporting coal have shifted their target and are now mining and transporting oil shale. According to the Geological Survey, the mountains near Dihua City are entirely composed of this oil shale, which is inexhaustible. This good news amidst the coal shortage not only reduces the threat of cold, but also provides a new scientific proof: oil shale can replace coal.

Severe winter has already arrived, and the winter relief effort of the Provincial Social Affairs Department has also begun. This year's relief target is 500 extremely poor people, with a budget of 120 billion provincial dollars, starting on the first of this month. (Our Correspondent, Ji Mu)

### Arrivals Still Pouring In, Sales Slightly Increased: Rice Slightly Up, Flour Slightly Firm, Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Turning Strong

The price of rice increased by ten yuan in the local market, causing the local market to become slightly firm and sales to increase slightly. The market prices in the North and South markets varied, with arrivals still pouring in. The total volume in both markets was 11,570 shi and eight dou. The North Market's price increased by ten yuan because the local demand was smoother. The prices were: superior white japonica rice at 370 yuan, superior thin indica rice at 350 yuan, yangxian rice at 360 yuan, and baiyuan rice at 350 yuan. In the South Market, only yangxian rice increased by ten yuan to 380 yuan, and early rice increased by five yuan to 340 yuan, while the rest remained unchanged. The prices at the rice shops did not change, with superior white japonica rice still marked at 440 yuan.

Flour

The market saw slightly looser credit among industry insiders, optimistic sentiment, and smoother demand, leading to a slight increase in prices. Battleship Flour was 125 yuan, closing at 128 yuan, up 5.5 yuan from the previous market. Lao Che Flour opened at 134 yuan and closed at 138 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands of flour all turned firmer, rising by 3 to 5 yuan. Bran also showed strength, with Fuxin large bags at 77 yuan, up 2 yuan.

Coarse Grains

Mostly up, with a few flat. Yellow beans turned stronger by ten yuan across the board. Pudong du beans were 185 yuan and Hankou feng beans were 157 yuan, with good sales. Shelled peanuts turned stronger by 30-40 yuan. Inland demand was still strong, with Nanjing shelled peanuts at 380 yuan. Red sorghum remained unchanged in price, with few transactions. Corn also turned stronger.

Edible Oil

First firm, then weak, with very smooth sales. Prices increased sharply across the board. At the opening, local factory soybean oil opened at a high of 800 yuan. The middle market was slightly weak, falling back to 750 yuan, then rising again to 770 yuan in the after-market, up 60-70 yuan from the previous market. Local factory rapeseed oil opened at 660 yuan, reaching 670 yuan in the mid-market. The market atmosphere softened in the after-market, and holders refused to sell. Sesame oil remained untraded. Chang Zi bean cake fell slightly by one yuan. Other Sheng Ji and Ren Ji remained unchanged, with limited transactions.

### Edible Oil and Oilseed Exports: Lifted Restrictions This Month

According to the Export Control Commission, edible oil and oilseeds were temporarily banned from export for three months starting September 1 this year due to domestic needs. Now, with domestic supply improving, the Executive Yuan has instructed the Commission to resume exports from December 1. Exporters of these goods can apply to the Export Control Commission, it is said.

### Measures Limiting Deposit and Loan Interest Rates: Ministry of Finance Orders Temporary Suspension

The Shanghai Financial Control Bureau recently issued an order from the Ministry of Finance that, in order to coordinate the implementation of supplementary measures for economic control, the Executive Yuan has approved the temporary suspension of the measures limiting deposit and loan interest rates for banks and money shops. The regulations of the Interest Rate Control Ordinance should still be strictly followed. The Bureau has reportedly issued a notice to the three Shanghai Banking, Money Shop, and Trust Associations, instructing all banks, money shops, and companies to comply, it is said.

### Foreign Exchange Continues to Rise

Maximum of 50 Yuan for Overseas Remittances Revised to 40 Yuan

Foreign exchange transfer certificates continued to rise sharply yesterday. At the opening in the morning, someone bought in at a high price of 40 yuan, but sellers held on to their certificates, creating a situation where there were too many monks and not enough porridge. The market price then rose rapidly, entering the 50-yuan range. The market atmosphere softened at the close, with transactions at 49 yuan. The quoted price for overseas remittances was also raised to 46 yuan yesterday, up 4 yuan from the previous high.

### Money Market Trend Stable

The money market trend remained stable. Although demand from various industries was strong, the supply was still abundant.
