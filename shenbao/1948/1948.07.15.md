Then, the transportation department budget was discussed. After Vice Minister Ling explained his insightful views on the review opinions, the original proposal in the "written opinions of the subgroup review" was passed without objection.

Subsequently, the food administration department budget was discussed. After reading out the subgroup review opinions, the discussion began. Minister Guan also made some explanations.

After two hours of heated debate, the results were also passed according to the original review opinions. Furthermore, the convening members of the Budget Committee, recognizing the need to expedite the review process, reconvened at 4:00 PM on the 14th to study technical improvements.

To be Submitted for Discussion at Tomorrow's Legislative Yuan Meeting

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Legislator Jian Guansan and 30 others recently proposed the "Draft Regulations on the Requisition and Appropriation of Deposits and Assets of Chinese People Abroad."

The seven reasons explained the rationality and necessity of requisitioning and appropriating the deposits and assets of nationals abroad in terms of our country's constitution, economic policies, national obligations, the examples of people donating gold during wartime and the British government appropriating overseas assets during wartime, as well as Chinese and foreign public opinion and bilateral agreements on economic assistance from the United States.

(2) The foreign exchange assets of overseas Chinese shall be exempt from requisition and appropriation. (3) Any Chinese or foreign individual or group may report to the registration authority on those who fail to report within the time limit or make false reports. After verification, 40% of the amount discovered shall be awarded as a bonus. (4) For foreign exchange assets that have been applied for registration, the government may appropriate 30% by issuing public bonds, and the remaining amount shall be appropriated using a progressive system based on the excess amount. For balances exceeding US$15,000 but less than US$30,000, 10% shall be appropriated, increasing cumulatively until for balances exceeding US$3 million, 50% shall be appropriated. (5) The funds requisitioned and appropriated shall be limited to subsidizing agriculture, industry, construction, and education. (6) Those who register early and legal persons engaged in industry, mining, transportation, public utilities, and export trade may have the appropriation amount reduced. (7) Those who fail to report within the time limit or make false reports with the intention of concealing assets, shall, after verification, have all their foreign exchange assets confiscated and be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years and not more than ten years. When necessary, those who are abroad may be permanently banned from issuing passports for departure. (8) Those who fail to pay the amount of requisition and appropriation as stipulated shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than ten years or life imprisonment. This case will be submitted for discussion at the 20th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 16th.

### Stop Issuing New Banknotes? Or Increase the Issuance of Large Denomination Notes?

According to news from financial authorities: The government has ordered the Central Bank to stop issuing banknotes in order to suppress the rising tide of prices. This is a welcome sound, and it is the desire of the general public that this is the absolute truth. However, at the same time, rumors about the issuance of so-called large denomination notes are still circulating in the market. Despite repeated denials from the relevant authorities, the general public speculates that, judging from past examples, this is just official rhetoric. Some even believe that, judging from the situation, the arrow is probably on the string, and it seems that large denomination notes have to be issued. Then, this ever-increasing currency problem is indeed worthy of everyone's attention.

Currently, cash is already being discounted, and on the one hand, the national banks are making large-scale purchases, while on the other hand, the Central Bank is releasing a large amount of materials in order to tighten the money supply. The authorities have their own plausible reasons for this approach, believing that this will help to suppress prices. However, from the perspective of the market, this is still nothing more than creating a situation to force the business community to automatically request it, as a good basis for the issuance of large denomination notes. Past experience tells us that this speculation does not seem to be without foundation.

Since the situation has turned to this point, whether large denomination notes should be issued and what impact they will have on prices seem to no longer need much discussion. Anyway, everyone agrees, and the authorities will certainly comply with public opinion and issue them immediately. Even if some people are too worried and still believe that this will stimulate prices, they may not be able to suppress it in the end, so that these large denomination notes will not be issued for a long time.

Indeed, there is not enough cash now, and counting and carrying it is too troublesome. Even if large denomination notes are not issued, the rising tide of prices may not be able to be suppressed for long. Because the rise in prices is due to the excessive amount of banknotes in circulation, the shrinking circulation area, and the too-fast turnover rate, and not simply due to the size of the banknotes. Therefore, the worry of stimulating prices may not resolutely cancel this matter.

Having said that, the rise in prices is indeed closely related to the amount of currency. President Weng once publicly stated this in the Legislative Yuan. Former Presidents Song and Zhang and the Minister of Finance also admitted this clearly and did not shy away from it. Therefore, issuing large denomination notes and increasing the currency will indeed stimulate prices and force them to rise, but stopping the issuance of large denomination notes and continuing to issue more small denomination notes, how can we stabilize the currency value and stabilize prices? Unless the central government has a great determination, from now on, to share a common understanding with the people, and never issue a single new banknote, regardless of the size of the banknote, it will be difficult to reverse the raging waves of prices.

Therefore, the focus of this problem is not on whether the rumored large denomination notes should be issued and when they should be issued, but on whether the government has the determination and means to resolutely stop the ever-increasing currency inflation. In other words, today's question is whether to stop issuing banknotes, not whether to issue new large denomination notes.

If the central government is still perfunctory and muddling through, without making a decision on the currency, then as a result of rising prices and higher costs, the so-called large denomination notes that are now planned to be issued will probably become small denomination notes again in a few months. At that time, the amount of banknotes issued will again be deemed insufficient. And counting and carrying them will still be considered too troublesome. At that time, another larger denomination banknote will inevitably arise in response to the times. Prices and banknotes, thus mutually cause and effect, circulate and appear, we really dare not imagine. We really don't know: should the country's currency, finance, and price policies continue to be allowed to evolve along this track?

We understand very well that the imbalance in financial revenue and expenditure is forcing the authorities to issue banknotes indiscriminately in order to meet urgent needs. The financial authorities also know the great disadvantages of issuing banknotes indiscriminately, but they are just doing this lazy job of printing money under the cover of the word "emergency"! I don't know that emergency is just emergency, and it can't be regarded as regular. There are many ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and it is absolutely impossible to rely on issuing banknotes as the only way, and it is absolutely impossible to rely solely on printing banknotes as the only trick of the Minister of Finance! We have also repeatedly discussed the plan to make up for the deficit, and there are many suggestions from all sides on this. We absolutely do not believe that the country's finances have reached the point where they cannot be supported without issuing banknotes.

The ancients said: "If you don't hold it when it's dangerous, and you don't help it when it's falling, then what's the use of that minister!" The current issuance policy is indeed too dangerous and too dangerous, and it must be quickly supported. Those who are responsible should no longer sit idly by and take no action. It is even more inappropriate to take the slogan of suppressing the rebellion as a shield for issuing banknotes indiscriminately, and it is even more inappropriate to talk emptily about price stability, blame hoarding, and lightly push this major responsibility of inflating the currency completely onto the business community. As for the rumored large denomination notes, if they stop here and no larger denomination notes are found one after another in the future, we think this is not a big deal. If the policy of currency inflation is still followed and there is no intention to stop it, then, without waiting for the so-called large denomination notes, the medium and small denomination notes currently issued are enough to make the national economy and the people's livelihood devastated!

### Regarding the Arrest of Three Students from Zhongda University, The Capital Garrison Headquarters Announces the Arrest and Interrogation Process, The "Rescue Committee" Was Planned by Professional Students

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The spokesperson of the Capital Garrison Headquarters recently issued a statement regarding the arrest of Hua Binqing and other three people reported in today's newspaper, the organization of the National Central University Rescue Committee for Arrested Students by Zhongda University students, and the decision on six rescue measures, stating: The Headquarters recently received a report from the Capital Police Department; a resident named Zhou Shaoqing in Sandao Gengzi, Sanwen River, has extremely secretive activities, and at the same time, people with suspicious movements come and go from his home every day. Huang Zhuosheng and Chen Yongkang, two police officers from the Shizhenqiao Police Station under his jurisdiction, paid close attention to this matter. At 9 PM on the 5th, they saw four more people entering Zhou Shaoqing's home. Chen and Huang, the two police officers, dispatched police to arrest the four people, who fled in all directions. They were arrested one after another until 2 AM. However, Zhou Shaoqing escaped and has not been captured yet. At the same time, important documents such as meeting records were found in Zhou Shaoqing's home. After taking them to the station, one of the four people named Tao Ronggui confessed that he had contacted the students and agreed to meet at the Shangxinhe Beikou at 7 AM on the 6th of this month to send the student to Chaoxian County, Anhui. Chen and Huang, the two police officers, immediately waited at Beikou according to the confession. At 7 AM, they saw the student who contacted Tao Ronggui and two other students arriving at Beikou together. Chen and Huang, the two police officers, immediately stepped forward to question them and found some reactionary books, leaflets, accounts, etc. on the students. After taking them to the station for questioning, they learned that the three students were: Zhu Chengxue (Department of Law, Zhongda University), a Communist professional student; Li Fei (Department of Chemical Engineering, Zhongda University); and Hua Binqing (Department of Political Science, Zhongda University). They were immediately sent to the bureau for interrogation. The students realized that they could not hide their crimes, and they also admitted them without hesitation. They also confessed frankly in their confessions and regretted their illegal actions. They also secretly used social relations to rescue them from all sides. The Police Department considered the case to be of great importance and has transferred the evidence of the crime to the Special Criminal Court for handling according to law. Once the judgment is made, the entire case can be announced. The Rescue Committee organized by Zhongda University students is thought to be planned by Communist professional students, just as Commander-in-Chief Sun predicted in his last speech: "After this case occurs, the Communist bandits will inevitably create rumors, confuse the public, and then instigate turmoil to increase the difficulties of law enforcement agencies." The Headquarters eagerly hopes that students will maintain reason and abide by discipline and not be used by the Communist bandits.

When entering Qingyun Road, it is as flat as an arrow. This road was hastily built by Ma Buqing, the former commander of the Fifth Cavalry Army, during his troop transfer.

### Western Allied Nations Protest the Blockade of Berlin, Moscow Submits a Response, British and American Air Transport Capabilities Greatly Enhanced

[United Press, London, 14th] Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Zarubin, delivered Moscow's long-awaited response to the British, American, and French protests on the 14th. The nature of the Soviet response is not immediately known. The response was submitted as Western diplomats in Berlin expected an unfavorable reply. Zarubin handed the reply to Minister of State McNeil, nearly a week after the three countries demanded that the Soviet Union lift the "intolerable" blockade of Berlin. The most authoritative sources here expect the Soviet Union to propose reopening the Four Power talks on all German issues and abandoning the West German plan in response to the Western protest. However, the West does not intend to bargain before the Berlin blockade is lifted. Relations between East and West in Germany have reached a dead end, leading Western diplomats to unanimously recognize that the only solution is another attempt by senior officials, but they remain silent on official plans. Two months ago, they ridiculed the reopening of the Four Power Conference, but now they have changed to skepticism and do not deny the possibility of a new Foreign Ministers' meeting.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, delivered the Soviet response to the State Department on the 14th.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] The French Foreign Ministry received the Soviet response to France's protest regarding the Berlin incident at 12:30 PM today.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Authoritative sources said that even if Moscow rejects the protest over the Berlin crisis, Britain, the United States, and France have agreed on a plan for joint action. The three countries are considering forcing Moscow to respond. It is reported that if the protests of the three countries are rejected, they will break the blockade with joint action. The three countries have drafted several methods in London. It is reported that possible actions include: (1) Submitting the Berlin dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to establish the legality of the three countries' presence in Berlin and the right to transport supplies through the Soviet zone. (2) Having the Security Council consider the matter based on the provisions for investigating threats to peace. However, this move would not help the situation, as the Soviet Union has veto power. (3) Testing the Soviet blockade with force, which may be shelved due to being too dangerous. Officials still reflect hope that the Soviet Union will suddenly lift the blockade. Sources acknowledge that the situation is increasingly serious, but do not imply that the West is prepared to use force.

[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] Sources close to the Soviet military government say that Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet forces in Germany, Sokolovsky, will postpone his return to Berlin for several days because the Soviet response to the Western powers' protest against the Berlin blockade has not yet been drafted.

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Air transport between West Germany and Berlin is expected to increase due to improved weather. Air Force Minister Henderson announced today that since the start of the airlift on July 1, 2,000 supply planes have landed in Berlin. The Wunstorf Airport in the British zone of West Germany is insufficient, and another take-off base will be opened. Once completed, the number of airlifts can be further increased. The British-American Air Transport Joint Command announced that starting next week, the daily transport of supplies to Berlin, including food and coal, can be increased from the current 3,000 to 4,000 tons to 6,000 tons. Many C-54 Skymasters continue to fly from the United States to Frankfurt today to enhance air transport capabilities. There are now 30 Skymasters in Germany. Officials at Tempelhof Airport in the American sector of Berlin also said that the newly built runway that can accommodate B-29 aircraft will be completed soon, allowing large aircraft to take off and land.

### Italian Communist Leader Assassinated, Major Riots in Rome, Assailant Named Pallante Arrested on the Spot

Italian Communist Leader Togliatti

[Reported by our newspaper] Rome, 14th Broadcast: Italy has fallen into the biggest chaos since the end of the war after the assassination of the Communist leader Togliatti. Communist parties are demonstrating everywhere. The National Labor Union controlled by the Communist party has announced an indefinite strike. A large number of workers attacked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accusing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the "murderer." The police opened fire, killing and injuring dozens of people.

Another Message: The Italian Communist Party has requested the government to resign.

[Reported by our newspaper] New York, 14th Broadcast: The assassinated and wounded Italian Communist leader has now escaped danger.

[Reuters, Rome, 14th] Togliatti, the 54-year-old leader of the Italian Communist Party, was wounded in an assassination attempt this morning when leaving the Chamber of Deputies. He was taken to the hospital by ambulance in a coma. As soon as Togliatti left the side door of the parliament, he was shot four times by a young man in his thirties, with bullets entering Togliatti's chest. The assailant was arrested on the spot. After Togliatti was taken to the hospital, surgery was performed immediately. A recent bulletin from the doctor stated that "the injured person has undergone a blood transfusion. The most serious bullet wound is in the left chest under the armpit. The lungs appear to be fine. To avoid shock, there are two other wounds that have not been examined. The injured person has been injected with first aid drugs. Generally speaking, the injury is quite worrying."

Police announced that the assailant's name is Pallante, a 30-year-old student who confessed that he came to Rome from Randazzo, near Catania, and had been planning to assassinate Togliatti for a long time. After Togliatti was shot and fell to the ground, he was helped up, and his first question was whether his briefcase and documents were still there and whether the assailant had been arrested.

Unofficial reports say that the assailant, Pallante, is a fourth-year law student who claims not to belong to any political party. However, members of the Liberal Party in Rome said that Pallante was a member of the party and withdrew in 1946. It is said that the assailant admitted that he came to Rome specifically to assassinate this "enemy of the state." Unconfirmed reports say that the assailant had an older brother who died in the Soviet Union during the war. Interior Minister Scelba announced that the assailant's name may be Pallante or Talante.

### Italian General Confederation of Labor Launches National General Strike

[Reuters, Rome, 14th] After Togliatti's assassination, the Italian General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communist Party, immediately ordered a general strike in Rome. Public transportation was the first to stop, followed by city employees. Workers began to set up blockades around factories, and were driven away by police with batons. Major public utilities such as gas, electricity, and water continue to operate as usual. The general strike has been brewing for many days, and Togliatti's assassination prompted its outbreak, forming the Communist Party's first response to the murder.

[United Press, Milan, 14th] The General Confederation of Labor here has also ordered a general strike, and labor is planning a large-scale demonstration. All officers have been ordered to concentrate and stand by.

### Prime Minister De Gasperi Visits the Hospital to Express His Condolences

[Reuters, Rome, 14th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi personally visited the hospital at around 1:00 PM today to express his condolences to the assassinated and wounded Togliatti. De Gasperi said that this was an event that could not be worse and was not the behavior that political struggles should have. Interior Minister Scelba has telephoned police stations across the country to closely prevent unrest caused by Togliatti's assassination.

### Three Commanders in Germany to Meet Today to Discuss Counter-Proposals to the West German Constitution, Eden Delivers a Speech to Germans in Berlin

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 14th] British, American, and French military governors in Germany, Robertson, Clay, and Koenig, are scheduled to hold their monthly meeting here on the 15th to discuss German administrative issues. After the prime ministers of the eleven states in West Germany meet to discuss the proposals for West Germany from the London Conference, their resolution and counter-proposals are expected to be submitted to the three commanders.

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden, Deputy Leader of the British Conservative Party, gave a speech to 2,000 Germans in the British sector of Berlin today, urging the Germans in Berlin not to fear the Soviet Union and promising that the Western Allies would never abandon the Germans in Berlin. Eden said that the British opposition party fully supports the British government's position in the Berlin crisis and believes that the Western Allies must continue to station troops in Berlin. Eden is scheduled to go to Frankfurt with Robertson tonight to meet with Clay.

### The United States Refutes Soviet Accusations

The Berlin Air Force Did Not Violate Rules

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 13th] U.S. Deputy Commander in Germany, Hayes, again rejected the protest alleging that the U.S. plane violated aviation safety rules in a letter to the Soviet Chief of Staff, Lukanchenko, today. Hayes said that he does not know what basis the Soviet side's statement that the flight of the U.S. plane was not approved by the Soviet side has, because the Allied equipment obviously has the absolute right to fly in the air corridor. Moreover, the flight schedule of the U.S. plane is published daily to publicly notify the members of the Berlin Aviation Safety Committee. In any case, it is obvious that the U.S. plane has never violated aviation safety rules.

### The Security Council Passes the US Resolution, Ordering a Ceasefire Between Arab and Jewish Forces Within Three Days, Those Who Violate the Order Will Be Subject to Military and Economic Sanctions

[Reported by our newspaper] New York, 14th Broadcast: All countries have unanimously approved the US proposal, and the Security Council has submitted an ultimatum to both Arab and Jewish forces, ordering a ceasefire within 72 hours. Canada and Belgium, which had previously opposed the US proposal, have now expressed their agreement.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 13th, United Press] Palestine mediator Bernadotte said today that the new ceasefire proposal for Palestine requires 2,000 to 2,500 observers to ensure that the ceasefire can be implemented as stipulated. Bernadotte spent more than an hour answering questions from Security Council representatives, including Soviet Representative Gromyko's sharp questions to Bernadotte. Britain supports the US proposal in principle, so it is very likely that the proposal will be approved by the Security Council. The US proposed that the Security Council order the Arabs and Jews to unconditionally agree to a ceasefire. If either side violates this order, the provisions of the UN Charter will be invoked to impose economic and military sanctions.

British officials still hope that Bernadotte's proposal and the plan to establish a demilitarized zone in Jerusalem will lead to a new ceasefire agreement.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Dailin, the "Shanghai Yang Sister" who is a mystery of not eating, has been moved to the Shanghai Health Sanatorium near Hongqiao yesterday afternoon after being examined at the home of Dr. Hua Shujun for 25 days.

She became ill in the past two days, which caused her to vomit after eating bananas. The doctors participating in the examination tried to induce her to eat other foods, but Zhang refused.

Zhang Hongde, Gu Lida, and others who participated in the examination at Hua's residence issued a report yesterday, the main points of which were: (1) There were always two or three people watching Zhang Dailin for 25 days, proving that Zhang did not eat any other food except for eating a few bananas or apples every three days. (2) The amount of heat Zhang absorbed was very different from the amount of heat she consumed. Where this heat came from is worth studying.

### Over a Hundred Thugs Threaten Brothel; Police Officer Beaten and Fires in Self-Defense; Two Arrested, One Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 10:45 PM last night, over a hundred thugs suddenly arrived at the "It's Me" brothel at No. 13 Qunyufang, Shantou Road. They were all carrying weapons such as knives and three-section staffs and attempted to rush into the brothel to destroy it. Fortunately, criminal police officers Ding Wenyang and Ye Junyi of the Municipal Police Bureau, and members of the Flying Fortress team, Zhang Renjie, saw it and rushed to disperse them. Unexpectedly, they used three-section staffs to violently strike Ye Junyi's left leg and back. For self-defense, the police officers drew their guns and fired three shots. One bullet hit the right arm of the hooligan Yu Huarong. The rest fled outside the alley and scattered along Yunnan Road to the entrance of the Tianchan Theater. Afterwards, the police officers caught one hooligan, Zhang Lianxiang (23 years old, from Hebei), and seized a three-section staff and a knife. They were brought to the Criminal Investigation Department of the General Bureau for interrogation. The injured Yu Huarong was sent to the Police Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the group of thugs intended to extort monthly protection money from brothels in the Shantou Road and Fuzhou Road area. Because Wu Zhonghua, the owner of the "It's Me" brothel, refused, Wu was ambushed and beaten by more than 30 thugs in front of the Daguangming Cafe when he went out of the International Hotel at midnight four days ago. He is still in the hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, their anger was not vented, and they gathered again last night to destroy the brothel.

Although it is still considered enthusiastic, the amount of pledged donations is too small. According to a person in charge of the Municipal Government, most of the donors are legal entities, and only five donors are natural persons. The native place associations were originally included in the list of fundraising targets, but there are many difficulties, and there is currently no progress. The Municipal Government is quite disappointed.

### The "Thin Knife Gang" Affects Public Safety; Police Bureau Determined to Eradicate Them; Groups of Three to Five Form Deadly Cliques, Specializing in Seeking Revenge and Fighting for Others

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, a so-called "Thin Knife Gang" has been discovered in the city, constantly causing disturbances and acting lawlessly. The Criminal Investigation Section of the Police Bureau has arrested more than twenty key members of the gang. The weapons they use are sharp blades about one foot long and weighing over two pounds, made by Xu Tongxing and Hong Changxiang and other knife shops on Guangdong Road. Sixty-one knives have been sold so far, but only twenty have been recovered by the police. Currently, in addition to warning the knife shops not to manufacture such weapons in the future, the police bureau is also making every effort to investigate and crack down on the gang. It is reported that the gang is called the "Thin Knife Gang" because most of the weapons they carry are thin knives. In reality, there is no formal organization. They are merely groups of three to five vegetable vendors, meat vendors, fish vendors, rickshaw pullers, and general unemployed vagrants, using gang organizations as a cover to secretly form deadly cliques specializing in seeking revenge and fighting for others, becoming a kind of professional thug. They are mostly distributed in Yangshupu, Jiangpu Road, Zhabei, Xinqiao Road in the Nanshi area, and have recently committed numerous crimes. The most vicious ringleaders, Wei Maogou, Du Xiaomao, and Yang Ming, have not yet been apprehended. These people are disrupting social order and affecting public safety. The police bureau is determined to eradicate them with all its might. The bureau sincerely hopes that the perpetrators will repent and that the victimized citizens will report to the bureau as soon as possible so that they can be brought to justice.

### China's First High-Speed Train is Born in Changzhou

— Our reporter Li Tianxing

[Report from Our Newspaper in Wujin, 11th] It has been publicized in the press that the Qiji Factory has completed the newly built "Adiabatic Train." To this end, the reporter made a special trip to visit the factory with a comrade.

Qiji Factory Along the Train

The factory is located about half a mile west of Qishuyan Town. The factory is named after the place. It is located in the center of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Its predecessor was the Wusong Factory. It was moved here in 1937. One reason is that the location is suitable, and it is also near the Qishuyan Power Plant, making it easy to obtain electricity. Before the war, there were more than 1,500 employees. During the occupation, it was under the management of the puppet Central China Railway Bureau. After the victory, the property was returned to its original owner. After several years of recovery, there are now more than 3,000 employees, covering an area of more than 507,500 square meters. The total building area of the workshops is more than 32,400 square feet. The new and old buildings of all employee dormitories and other houses are about 800 rooms. The houses are adjacent to each other, forming a lively factory area. The number of workers and their families is nearly 10,000.

Internal Organizations of the Factory

The internal organization is mainly composed of four units: "Drawing," "Laboratory," "Training," and "Inspection," all under the "Technical Section." The "Supervision" and "Inspection" departments are directly responsible to the factory director. The work sections are divided into three groups: "Locomotive," "Vehicle," and "General." The equipment is divided into more than a dozen workshops: "Assembly," "Passenger Car," "Freight Car," "Boiler," "Repair," "Electrical," "Tool," "Automobile," "Subsidiary," "Sawmill," and "Material Testing." In addition, there are two educational institutions: a apprentice training class and a Rotary elementary school. In addition to a railway hospital, welfare programs such as sports and material distribution are managed by an organization. The factory buildings are lined up, and steel is everywhere. The sound of wheels turning, the sound of hammers, the creative atmosphere, and the smell of forging fill the hard picture and strong notes. Electricity, heat, and force, plus ideals, plus labor, are organized and performed. The scene is quite inspiring. The factory director, Gao Zhenzhou, is a tall man, a middle-aged Northerner in his forties, with ideals, perseverance, and boldness.

A Word from the Factory Director

After giving a welcome speech, Director Gao went on to explain the process of resolutely building this "China's First Train": He said, "In order to improve the quality of Chinese trains and to consider the facilities that passengers should have during their journey, we use our ideals to realize this train. The initial success is now achieved. But in order to have the train ready on time on July 15, everything is being rushed, and there are still many areas that are not ideal." He also said, "As of now, this new train is China's first train!" Then, a young engineer, Wang Guangyu, gave a further explanation of the new train.

Engineer's Explanation

Engineer Wang, a native of Liaoning, gave a further explanation of this new train with a very familiar and friendly attitude: According to him, there are many names for the newly built train in the outside world: Luxury Train, Adiabatic Train, Streamlined Train, but they are actually the same thing, that is, a high-speed train. When the factory was taken over, the total number of first, second, third, and fourth class vehicles was only 200, which was not enough. The first stage of the factory's three-year project was to increase the quantity. Now there are 600 vehicles, which is enough. Now the plan is to improve the quality. This so-called streamlined train is actually the first step in the ideal improvement of first-class cars. Continue to improve the second and third class vehicles.

Five Characteristics of the Train

The first valuable point of this "China's First Train" trial production is that 95% of the materials are locally sourced and manufactured by ourselves, with very little reliance on foreign countries. Features: (1) The car body is entirely welded, without any tacks, and the overall body is smooth and lovely. (2) Insulation: The air inside the car is isolated from the outside air. Electrical equipment is used to maintain a suitable temperature inside the car. On a hot day, it is constantly maintained at a gentle temperature 14 to 15 degrees lower than the outside, making people comfortable. Conversely, it also has insulation and adjustment in winter. (3) The seats all face forward. The seats have three angles. You can sit, lie down, or recline at will. When necessary, you can also turn around and talk to your friends behind you. Rotating and stretching is very comfortable. It guarantees passengers a considerable amount of comfort. (4) The bearings are all equipped with rollers, which can increase the speed. (5) The car door is connected to the steps. When the door is opened, there are steps to come down. When the door is closed, the steps disappear, which can reduce danger.

Ten New Cars in Total

A total of ten new cars were manufactured. Each car is 20 meters long, which is longer than the current car. In terms of appearance, from the front of the car to the last, everything is new. Among the ten cars, six are passenger cars, one is equipped with a generator, equipped with a diesel small powerful generator with a power generation of 100KW. The baggage room, mail room, conductor's room, telephone room, and broadcasting room are almost the entire nervous system of the car. The conductor can issue orders here and command the entire car. One is a dining car, with exquisite tables, about a dozen large and small. One end is equipped with electric stoves, electric ovens, and refrigerators. The supply of cold drinks and hot food is no problem. The delivery of food and tea is all scientifically and hygienically managed. There is sterilization equipment for used towels. The last car is an observation car, with a living room, sofas, and seats in the middle, specially for passengers to leisurely look at the scenery outside the suburbs, sit and chat, and listen to the radio.

### Fire Breaks Out in the Qiji Factory Workshop; Old Woman and Young Girl Buried in the Flames

[Report from Our Newspaper in Wujin, 12th] A worker's dormitory in the Qishuyan Factory caught fire accidentally on the morning of the 12th. A large number of matches and firewood were placed in the house. The fire was very fierce. An old woman on the second floor was unable to escape and jumped from the building and fell to her death. Another young girl was buried in the flames because she did not have time to escape while trying to retrieve her belongings. The fire brigade extinguished the fire in time to prevent it from spreading.

### Huzhou in Uproar Over Night Soil Issue

[Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxing, 12th] The city has been in an uproar over the night soil issue recently. The excrement of the city's population of more than 50,000 is seen as a piece of fat meat, and there are many who intend to monopolize it, causing a huge controversy. The county government ordered the health institute to try it out, but all the town's representatives believed that night soil was a legitimate source of income for the town government. After convening a town 保長 meeting, they decided to continue to do so. On the 12th, Director Wan went to take over but failed.

### Two Rickshaw Pullers in Shenyang Die Suddenly from Cholera

[Report from Our Newspaper in Shenyang, 13th] Cheng Yu, a rickshaw puller in the Nanshi District, suddenly died on the street on the afternoon of the 12th from cholera. Also, Cao Zhong, a 50-year-old rickshaw puller in the Beiling District, felt abdominal pain and vomiting at 4 PM on the same afternoon and died after a while.

### Shanghai People in Hong Kong

— Our special reporter Zi Jian

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hong Kong, 11th] The number of people coming to Hong Kong from Shanghai is increasing day by day. They unknowingly form a society of their own and also affect the original society, as if new blood has been transfused. A friend from Shanghai said: "Guangdong people come to Hong Kong to 'make a living', and Shanghai people come to Hong Kong to 'escape the world'. The former comes to make money, and the latter comes to spend money (at least some of them do). The former's living capital is based on the national currency, while the latter's luggage is full of US dollars or gold."

The extravagant spending habits of Shanghai people have generally surprised the average Hong Kong people in the past year or two. Most of Hong Kong's wealthy people started from "hard work and frugality." Even now, there is a popular story in the private sector about a wealthy businessman, so-and-so, walking on foot. When they see Shanghai people who have "fled the disaster" buying land worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, building factories worth one or two million dollars or houses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and having brand-new cars and gorgeously dressed concubines, how can they not "look at them with new eyes?"

Some stores opened by foreigners in Hong Kong used to be frequented by only a few high-class Chinese, but now they are surrounded by "Shanghai gentlemen" and "Shanghai ladies." The most expensive British silverware, even George VI of Buckingham Palace in London would not easily be able to buy, and the British occasionally send three or two pieces to Hong Kong in order to earn foreign exchange. Within half an hour, they are all snapped up by our wealthy fellow villagers. Those who arrive late are willing to pay a deposit first and pre-purchase the goods that will arrive on the next ship. A blue-eyed Manageress who is familiar with the psychology of the Chinese people told the reporter: "You Shanghai people are really rich!" The reporter couldn't help but sweat when he heard this!

### Tightening of Credit and Strict Inspection Cause Prices to Fall Across the Board; Severe Shortage of Cash in the Market; Promissory Notes Require a Discount

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, due to the tightening of credit, prices in the city fell across the board. Many Chinese stocks hit the limit down. Rice flour and oil and grains also fell sharply due to the tight credit and the authorities' strict inspection of warehouses, which caused panic and the release of hoarded goods. The market price of rice fell by an average of 1 million yuan, and the market price of high-quality white rice has retreated to the 30 million mark. Cotton yarn and cloth prices also fell by an average of 10% due to the extremely tight credit and the impact of the general decline in prices. Other commodities, such as silk, cigarettes, and daily necessities, also saw a sharp drop in wholesale prices. Business circles are closely watching the authorities' two policies of inspecting warehouses and selling goods. In particular, the establishment of the Materials and Finance Committee by the National Bank proves that the government has the determination to use US aid and other materials in its possession to stabilize prices, so they are all wary. The future price trend depends on the extent of the financial authorities' efforts to implement this policy.

Also, due to the National Bank's large-scale tightening of credit yesterday, there was a severe shortage of chips in the market. The discount on promissory notes increased from 5% to 8%. The bank felt the difficulties in its business and contacted the National Bank, hoping to receive cash assistance. However, it is generally speculated that the National Bank will use the opportunity of paying wages in mid-month to force industrial and commercial enterprises to sell goods in order to stabilize prices.

### National Bank Establishes Materials and Finance Committee to Control Materials Allocation Market; Inaugural Meeting Held Yesterday; Li Lixia Appointed as Convener

[Our Report] The Central Bank, in order to cooperate with the government in controlling the materials allocation market, decided to establish a Materials and Finance Committee to be responsible for handling matters such as the design, review, and assessment of materials allocation. The bank appointed seven individuals, including heads of relevant bureaus and departments Li Lixia, Xia Jinxiong, Wang Zhonglin, Chong Yong, Wu Changfu, Chen Shuzeng, and Zhou Shunxin, as well as Yu Ruxin, manager of the purchasing department of the China Trust Bureau, as members, with Li Lixia as the convener. The committee held its inaugural meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday, where it amended and passed the organizational regulations and key business points.

However, the bookkeeping and handling procedures will still be managed by the Business Bureau of the National Bank. It is reported that future materials allocation work will adopt a barter system to minimize the use of legal tender. The ultimate goal is to enable the government-controlled cotton yarn, sugar, and salt to be exchanged for food, which will be supplied for distribution in major cities. The handling of various materials will still be managed by the original agencies, with the National Bank only providing assistance in its capacity as the issuing authority and agent of the national treasury.

### Ministry of Education Counselor Liu Meets with Yunnan Chairman to Discuss Ways to Resolve Student Unrest; Students Forcibly Occupying Yunnan University Ordered to Vacate

[Our Correspondent in Kunming, 14th] Liu Yingshi, Counselor of the Ministry of Education, has been extremely busy since arriving in Kunming only a day ago. On the morning of the 14th, he exchanged views with Chairman Chu and Commander-in-Chief He on how to resolve the student unrest in Kunming. To this day, he still feels at a loss as to where to start. This afternoon, reporters visited Liu at the Ministry of Education. According to Liu, this trip is a mission to understand the actual situation. The Ministry of Education can only handle the administrative part of the school. Other parts related to public security and order have their own responsibilities, so it is inconvenient to intervene. Liu said that the student unrest in Kunming has deteriorated. It is neither a riot nor a revolution, let alone a strike. During the holidays, they are acting arbitrarily. The Ministry of Education cannot sit idly by. He has ordered the authorities of Yunda Nan and other universities that have been forcibly occupied to order students from other schools and non-students to evacuate immediately, and instructed all schools to be responsible for persuading students to leave to avoid trouble. Liu has no intention of contacting student representatives and is willing to listen to opinions from local elders, gentry, and public opinion organs to seek solutions. The duration of his stay in Kunming is undecided. Judging from the current situation, he feels very棘手. However, he will do his best. Currently, large posters have been posted on the walls of Yunda, hoping that Counselor Liu will visit the school to give instructions and make three requests: (1) Release the arrested students, (2) Please do not continue to adopt encirclement actions, (3) Guarantee the safety of students, etc. Liu remains silent on this matter, and the future development is difficult to predict.

### Method for Generating Basketball Champions in This Year's World Games: Elimination After Group Stage Round Robin

[Our Special Dispatch] Basketball is the most important event in this year's World Games. From July 30th—the day after the official start of the World Games—until the closing day on August 14th, there will be matches every morning, afternoon, and even evening, except for Sundays.

Although basketball is extremely popular worldwide, it only has two editions of history in the World Games (it was officially included as a competition event during the 11th World Games in Berlin in 1936). The first edition had 23 participating countries, adopting a double-knockout system. The teams eliminated in the first week held consolation matches with each other, and the winners still had the opportunity to compete with the winning teams from the first week. While the method was considered fair, there were many loopholes. For example, although the Philippines defeated Mexico in the second week of the preliminary round, they were eliminated by the strong team from the United States in the first week of the playoffs. Mexico, however, entered the semi-finals due to weak opponents and ended up getting third place, while the Philippines ranked fifth. Japan also defeated Poland but failed to participate in the playoffs. Poland, on the other hand, got fourth place due to Peru's withdrawal. In light of this, the International Amateur Basketball Federation, responsible for all competition matters, decided to switch to a round-robin elimination system from this year onwards after a long period of discussion.

Round-Robin Elimination

The so-called round-robin elimination system is divided into two parts. The first part, the preliminary round, adopts a group stage round-robin system. If there are 24 or fewer participating units, they will be divided into four groups. The top four teams from the previous edition, USA, Canada, Mexico, and Poland, will be the seeded teams for groups one, two, three, and four, respectively. The other teams will be drawn into each group. Each team gets two points for a win, one point for a loss, and zero points for a default. After a week of competition, the top two teams with the most points in each group will qualify for the second part of the competition.

The second part of the competition adopts an elimination system, with the champions of each group as seeded teams. The runners-up of each group will be drawn separately, but the principle is not to compete against the first-place team from the same group. In the final four-team playoffs, the winning two teams will compete for the championship and runner-up, and the losers will compete for the third and fourth places. The third and fourth places of each group in the round robin will form another elimination tournament to determine the ninth to sixteenth places. The remaining teams will form another elimination tournament to determine the seventeenth place and beyond.

Divide Into Eight Groups for 25 or More Teams

If there are 25 or more participating teams, the preliminary round robin will be divided into eight groups. According to the results of the previous World Games basketball competition and the 1947 South American and European Championships, (1) the United States, (2) Canada, (3) Mexico, (4) Poland, (5) the Philippines, (6) Uruguay, (7) the 1947 European Champion, and (8) the 1947 South American Champion will be the seeded teams for each group. The other teams will still be drawn into the groups.

The second part elimination tournament will still be participated in by the top two teams from each group. The champions of the first, second, and third groups will be the top three seeds. After the champions of the other five groups are drawn to determine their rankings, they will be drawn in according to the aforementioned method, under the principle that the top two teams in the same group will no longer fight each other. This battle will follow the elimination competition method to determine the champion, runner-up, third place, and fourth place.

Although the round-robin elimination system still has its drawbacks—if country A is in a group with a strong team, country B, in addition to the seeded team, it will be extremely difficult for country A to have any hope of entering the second part of the competition. However, at the same time, country C, whose strength is inferior to country A, may be in another group where everyone other than the seeded team is mediocre, and country C may obtain the playoff qualification—it is more perfect than the double-knockout system, which only requires a bye in the first week to enter the playoffs. In fact, it is absolutely impossible to have a perfect system for a competition that must be completed in such a short period of time. (Xin)

### Grade A Tennis League: Jin Lan vs. Green Light Set for Fierce Battle Today

Today is the sixth round of the Grade A Tennis League, with three matches as usual. The strengths of En Pai and You Lian are evenly matched, making the outcome difficult to predict. Jin Lan and Green Light face off, with Green Light lagging behind by more than twenty points. To strive for future rankings, Jin Lan will surely engage in a fierce battle today when they meet Green Light. It is hoped that Zhonghua will triumph at Tiyun's home court. However, due to yesterday's rain, each home and away team should contact each other to determine whether the venue is available. Order listed below:

You Lian — En Pai at You Lian

Green Light — Jin Lan at Green Light

Tiyun — Zhonghua at Tiyun

Also, in the first round of the Grade B League, there is still one match between Lian Mei and the Railway Team that has not been recorded and sent in. If it has not yet been held, it is hoped that a make-up match will be arranged immediately. Yesterday's fifth round of the Grade B League could not be played due to rain all day. It is hoped that a make-up match date will be set quickly.

### "Document Travels"

— Ping Zhai

A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that Chairman Chen of Zhejiang Province was reforming the document system, striving for simple and agile writing. I would really like to know how his trial is going.

I once saw an official document in a certain government agency. It was rolled up and covered with the stamps of eighteen handlers in a greasy, red mess. The content of this document was an extremely small and routine matter. I thought to myself, this can be called "the grand spectacle of bureaucratic politics," and couldn't help but laugh. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, I talked about this with a relative, and found that I was still a country bumpkin after all!

My relative works as a secretary in a national economic control agency, and is kicking and screaming about official documents all day long. According to her, she once saw a document with 58 stamps on it, and the final decision was the truly deserving "postpone." But this is not surprising. It is said that there was an employee who submitted a request for sick leave. This request "traveled" for many days, and when it was approved, the little employee who requested the leave had already been buried!

Why must official documents "travel" so laboriously? It is said that the agency is large, and there are many departments. If the stamps are not affixed, many things will not be known to all departments, and there may be loopholes in the processing. It seems to make sense, but the directors of our agencies all write small notes to add people or allocate funds. Even though this document should be delayed at many "stations" along the way, and there are people at each "station" holding stamps to be affixed, this small note flies right over them, arriving directly at the hand of the person ordered to execute it in the form of airmail. The departments may not fail to connect, and there may not be loopholes in the processing.

"Document travel" is also quite impressive in foreign countries. I just saw a new foreign magazine that said that there is a very confidential intelligence agency in the United States that uses a lot of funds, but the intelligence that this agency analyzes and organizes is all from six or seven months ago! The article also said that members of the U.S. Congress recently learned the truth and were quite surprised. This speed of "document travel" is really admirable: I admire their patience!

Therefore, thinking about the "handwritten orders" of the directors of our agencies, which are always high in power and above everything else, and President Roosevelt's often lightning-fast dispatch of special envoys, although they have been subject to a lot of criticism, are actually excusable.

I think that although our officialdom has always emphasized "skill" and paid attention to "posture," it would probably be a bit of a wrong to say that the directors deliberately hope to delay official business to the point of making people itch. I think there is a reason why "document travel" is so widespread: if you have ever had experience dealing with government agencies about money, you will never forget how difficult it is to receive a payment—today "the official business has not been approved," tomorrow "the official business has not arrived." Despite the price of goods jumping several times a day, the "slowly shout" of official documents remains the same. Do you want the official documents to "travel" sooner and get the money sooner? What's so difficult about that! A short break at the coffee shop, a "kowtow" to agree, and the official document will arrive immediately.

The "wonderful use" of "document travel" is probably in this kind of place.

### Raising Fish in Moldy Weather

— Wu Jiren

Every household experiences rain during the plum rain season. The storms of these past few days have severely threatened the things we grow and the goldfish we raise on the farm. In particular, the hundreds of tanks of goldfish, large and small, are in danger. Fortunately, the "old fish slave"—Old Liu—who raises them has decades of experience in raising fish, and he has managed to turn the tide and get them through this difficult time.

Raising fish in moldy weather is really difficult, because the air pressure is too low during this period. The fish in the tanks cannot withstand this suffocating atmosphere. Fortunately, Old Liu has the ability to release all these fish into the pond every evening, and then scoop them up and put them back into the sand tanks the next day, so they can be safe and sound.

All fish farmers feel this way in moldy weather, right? A good tank of fish, without any disease, will suddenly rest as a whole and stop breathing (in technical terms, "suffocation"), turning white and floating to the surface of the water one by one. However, there is no way to revive them, and they can only be allowed to die prematurely.

In moldy weather, the only way to prevent it is to put all the small fish in the tanks into clear ponds and continue to feed them, but in smaller quantities than usual. Sunlight cannot be avoided, but you must also pay attention to the fact that the scorching sun can make the water hot. Only by placing reed curtains over the gaps on the surface of the pond, air can still circulate, the heat can be reduced, and the fish will not become moldy or be affected by the cold.

People feel uncomfortable during the moldy season, which is also the dangerous period for goldfish. After the moldy weather passes, the fish can develop and grow, and there will be no other dangerous signs.

When San Yuan Shi Zhang was returned to Hangzhou for burial, I was unable to go due to official duties. I specially took Pu Xin Yu to worship at the grave on Xu Village Arch Mountain. Feeling inspired, I wrote a poem. Cao Jingtao

The beacon smoke blocked the stars and frost. I was finally glad to return the flags to the old collection. Qu Yuan mourned his homeland. His writing illuminated a generation. The famous mountain and a piece of stone tablet left a trace of virtuousness. My humble residence left a poem to express my sadness. (My humble residence has many of his calligraphy.) Today, the Eastern Chu accompanied Ruzi, and I will leave a good tree to express my fragrance. (On this day, Xin Yu picked a branch of arbutus in the cemetery and wrote about it when he returned.)

Zhou Shutao Sent Me the Collection of Yu Xuanji from the Jing Song Dynasty, and I Wrote a Poem of Thanks

Collecting ancient books and paying them away vaguely, thousands of yuan and hundreds of songs are scattered like smoke, leaving the Peng Ben still intact, and I quickly saw fifty poems by Yu.

The old master of the book collection in the past, the inscription poems are the most exquisite, and the thousands of images of Lu You are vividly in front of me, with a sad look on his eyebrows and beard. (Han Yun himself signed the master of the Song Bookstore, and his portrait was published at the beginning of the book.)

I wandered around with melancholy thoughts, and once I opened the seal, I was overjoyed, and it was a beautiful woman who was hard to get again, and the lone copy in the world returned the fragrance of souls.

### "Wine Talk" Reply to Yan Qiao

— Chen Yixian

Recently, I read Mr. Yan Qiao's "Wine Talk" in the New Garden of the News, which said: "Mr. Zhang Yunsheng set up Shenli Wine Company on Zhongzheng East Road, which stores a wealth of famous overseas wines and also likes to drink. ...A month later, he came again and said that the Free Talk of the Shen Bao published Mr. Chen Yixian's "Talking About Wine," which also has Liu Ling's addiction. I would like to have a ten-day drink in Pingyuan with him. If we talk about imported fine wines, then the English 'Whiskey' and the French 'Brandy' have been stored for more than 30 years. He also made an appointment to visit Wulin from the office, and Yanjing has an old Shaoxing wine shop 'Chunhao,' which is different from the usual shops. I wonder if Mr. Chen has this elegant interest? Why not visit it?"

After reading the above words, I am very grateful to Mr. Zhang for his intentions. However, I have not been drinking as much as before recently. I dare not compete with Mr. Zhang for a ten-day drink in Pingyuan. Thirty years ago, I drank with Gan Hansen in Feiyuan. A few pieces of biscuits were used to drink brandy or whiskey with beer glasses. Without adding water, each person could drink a bottle. Recently, my alcohol tolerance has decreased, and there are three reasons for this: first, I am getting older, and my energy is not as strong as before. I have a sense of fear when I see a big glass of brandy; second, I have hemorrhoids recently. I had surgery five years ago, and the wound has not healed yet. I dare not eat too much; third, the price of wine has been too high recently. I don't want to drink inferior wine, and I can't afford to drink too much of the wine that I can drink. Therefore, my alcohol tolerance has become narrower and narrower.

When I lived in Hangzhou, I drank Shaoxing wine every afternoon as a routine. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I did not leave Shanghai for a single step. It was difficult to get Shaoxing wine, so I switched to drinking white wine. There is a Tongbaohe Hotel opposite my residence, and the Shaoxing wine it sells still has a true taste. I usually drink about six ounces of wine every evening during dinner. If there are guests or delicious dishes, I drink two or three cups of Sichuan Daqu. Although Daqu is fragrant, it is too expensive to drink a lot. It is really not easy to get good Shaoxing wine in Shanghai. Last month, I had a good drink at Mr. Dai Liangji's place. Mr. Dai is from Sichuan, and his dishes are excellent. That day, I originally wanted to eat a big meal with him, but after tasting the Shaoxing wine, it was extremely fragrant, so I drank it as much as possible. This kind of fine wine can only be obtained in the homes of good friends. Recently, I took a small trip to West Lake with my friends. I went on June 5th and returned on the 10th (the day before the Dragon Boat Festival). I drank three times at the Zhu Hengsheng Hotel. Although I can't call it good wine, it was indeed brewed in Shanyin, which is not easy to get in Shanghai. I don't even know that there is a wine shop called "Chunhao" in Yanjing mentioned by Mr. Zhang. I will definitely try it when I go to the lake in the future.

I have heard of Mr. Yan Qiao's name for a long time, and his writings are often read in the newspaper, but I have no chance to meet him. He said in "Wine Talk": "You must find a companion to drink with. As the saying goes, 'Wine meets bosom friends, a thousand cups are too few.' This is indeed true." I very much agree with this. Among all my wine friends in Shanghai, only Xu Boqiu understands the fun of wine. Mr. Xu is from Hangzhou, and is good at playing the flute, and is known as the "King of Flutes." When I drink with Boqiu, I often feel that there are too few wine companions. However, this matter is flavorful when it is unintentional and natural, but it is boring when it is a formal dinner party. I ask Mr. Yan Qiao about this, I wonder what he thinks?

### Climate Prediction

— Shan Shi

"When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring." Although this is a passage from the Bible, it has a fairly accurate scientific basis. The English Observation Magazine lists the following so-called old wives' experiences, which are quite interesting:

If your hair is softer than usual, it is a sign that it will rain; because hair stays hard in high air pressure (sunny and dry weather).

Old injuries, such as tooth decay and swollen feet, become aggravated when it will rain because of low air pressure.

The weather is likely to rain without dew, because the non-production of dew is caused by a lack of cloud central nuclear particles to condense it.

If there is a blurry halo around the moon, it will rain in four hours, because moon halos are formed by refraction of ice or water vapor in the air.

Yellow evening glow foretells rain the next day, because the setting sun passes through humid air; red glow foretells clear sky the next day, because the sun's rays pass through dry air particles.

If the smoke coming out of the chimney has a downward trend, it foretells rain, because the smoke does not easily rise in low-pressure wet winds.

In clear weather, birds fly high because their wings are drier and they fly very high. If it will rain, swallows fly low because low air pressure disturbs their sensitive hearing.

Seagulls stop to rest as a warning of an approaching storm, because birds are easily tired in the thin air of low pressure.

If cumulus clouds gradually become black and low at noon, it may rain at dusk; only a few cumulus clouds in the high sky foretell several days of sunny weather.

### Eastern Scales and Western Claws

— Cang Yu

The Bridgeton Liars' Club in the United States nominates a world liar of the year. The 1947 title was won by J. Hoppley of San Antonio. His story is that when he was playing bocce ball, a fly flew over and landed on the eighth ball. He flicked it, and the eighth ball flew away in response, but the ball went so fast that the fly lost its footing and fell on the table, breaking its spine.

The strangest hotel in the world is located in a forest ten miles outside of Kanya City, a British colony in Africa. The hotel is built on a large tree, forty feet above the ground. Guests at the Tree Tops Hotel can safely see various jungle beasts coming to drink water in the pond in front of the hotel in the morning and evening. The hotel room rate is $50 per day. Guests are transported to and from Kenya by armed guards at no extra charge.

### In Praise of Monks

— Gongsun Wu

After Wang Anshi resigned as prime minister, he wrote a commentary on the Shurangama Sutra, elaborating on the omissions of other teachers and omitting the details of other teachers. There were places where he expressed his unique knowledge, but unfortunately his book was not passed down. Wang was a great politician, and his courage was extraordinary. He may have gained something from Buddhism. In his collection of poems imitating Hanshan and Shide, he wrote, "Courage comes from Meng Shishe, who has no fear. If people learn Buddhism, courage should be like this." Chen Yi also praised the Buddha for his courage. Their views were the same, but the world believes that Buddhist learners must be "passive." If Wang's reforms were not so-called actively taking. Zeng Gong was also a critic of Buddhism. In a letter to Wang, he said that Buddhist scriptures disrupt customs. Wang replied, "The disruption of customs today does not lie in Buddhism, but in the fact that scholars and officials are immersed in profit and desire, and value each other's words, but do not know how to govern themselves." His praise of monks was that "they are mostly tolerant and not jealous, simple and quiet, and have no desires. When scholars boast and steal, those who have ended and have nothing are more numerous in the world, so they are detached and aloof." He also praised two monks, saying, "They have both used their knowledge to free themselves from the filth of the world, and they all have the talent of intelligence and wisdom." Those who learn Buddhism are intelligent, wise, not jealous, and not acquisitive, while those who boast and steal are regarded as passive, which is indeed their intention. However, his words are not exhaustive. Are Buddhist disciples merely detached and aloof?

### 

The imperial examinations of the past were deeply rooted in history and held significant importance for politics and society, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

Its social significance lay in breaking down class barriers, allowing the masses opportunities for development, fairness, and equality. It aimed to even out wealth and status, as everyone depended on it. For example, wealthy merchants and large landowners enjoyed favorable treatment in ordinary times, and their wealth could influence many. However, once involved in litigation or assigned public service, government officials could exert pressure, and runners and servants could extort and harass them, even leading to ruin. But if they could hire a teacher for their children and diligently study the classics to pass the examination, obtaining just one "Xiucai" degree meant "entering the official's gate." The perception and treatment of this person and their family by political, business, agricultural, and literary circles would undergo a significant shift. (If a Xiucai was treated this way, the situation for Juren and Jinshi degree holders was even more evident. As for buying an official title with money, while it could maintain appearances, it did not command genuine respect from all sides.)

From another perspective, a poor child, as long as they could study diligently and become literate, could enter the "official's gate." Some wealthy farmers and merchants would eagerly seek to marry their daughters to him or recruit him into their family, because if the family lacked scholarly offspring, having a Xiucai as a son-in-law would bring glory to the family. They might even share assets and provide support for the provincial and metropolitan examinations, hoping for further advancement and to have him tutor their own sons. Thus, this poor child, through success in the imperial examination, not only gained fame but also wealth. Hence the saying, "In books, there are faces of jade; in books, there are houses of gold." As long as one studies, one need not worry about living a life of luxury. This is the wonderful use of "poor people turning over" and leveling wealth.

Now, let me give a concrete example, such as Mr. Lu Runxiang Fengshi, the last famous Suzhou Zhuangyuan and Prime Minister of the Qing Dynasty. His father's name was Song, and he served as an instructor at the Zhenjiang Prefectural School, a so-called "bean curd official," implying a humble position. Zhenjiang was formerly known as "Runzhou," and there was a "Phoenix Stone Scenic Spot" in the Prefectural School. Mr. Lu was born in his grandfather's official residence, hence the name "Runxiang" and the style name "Fengshi." ("Xiang" refers to schools.) In his youth, he studied diligently with his father, and in the Guiyou year of the twelfth year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty, he passed the Juren examination. The following year, in the Jiaxu year, he achieved the top rank in the Jinshi examination and was awarded the position of Compiler. In the Bingzi year (the second year of Guangxu, only one year after the Jiaxu year), he served as a co-examiner for the metropolitan examination in the spring. In the autumn, he was appointed chief examiner of Hunan Province. As an imperial envoy, he was provided with accommodations and transportation by local officials all the way to the province. Upon arrival, cannons were fired and a temporary residence was built, with all the ceremonial honors and etiquette equal to that of the governor. Recalling that just three years earlier, he was merely an ordinary scholar, it was truly a meteoric rise, placing him among the elite!

In dramas, such as "Yu Tang Chun," Wang Jinlong, a down-on-his-luck scholar, became an imperial inspector because he topped the imperial examination. According to the Ming system, there were two high officials and three departments in a province. The two high officials were the governor, in charge of all administrative and livelihood matters, and the imperial inspector, responsible for investigating and impeaching derelict officials, receiving complaints everywhere, and hearing grievances. Such was the Wang Inspector in the play. Typically, the imperial inspector was an official from the Imperial Censorate. In the Ming Dynasty, censors were only seventh-rank officials (elevated to fifth-rank in the early Qing Dynasty), but as an imperial envoy, he was an "inspector." Therefore, the financial and judicial commissioners, although second or third-rank senior officials (the red-robed and blue-robed officials in the play), would bow and pay respects when they met him, and sit on both sides of the hall (the third department was the Regional Military Commission, which was not seated because it was in charge of military affairs). Wang Jinlong, as a down-on-his-luck youth, attained a high position and enjoyed honor. Although it is a play, it realistically portrays the transformative power of the imperial examination, breaking down class barriers and distinctions between rich and poor, noble and lowly. (Whether Wang and Su were real people and whether the cases were the same is a matter for scholars to research and another question.)

In old novels and plays, many stories warn against wealthy and powerful families who "despise the poor and love the rich," often regretting it when their poor son-in-law achieves high rank in the imperial examination. Such stories abound. Hence, there is a saying: "This year's Xiucai, next year's 'ba he' (eight measures of rice)."

To say that everyone should be rich and noble, or that everyone should toil and suffer, is equality is merely an ideal. But equal opportunity is equality.
