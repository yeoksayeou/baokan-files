### Yan Xishan Arrives in Nanjing to Meet the President, Expressing That the Overall Situation Is Not Irretrievable; Hu Zongnan Arrives in Nanjing from Shaanxi on the Same Day by Plane

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, arrived in Nanjing at 1:30 PM on the 28th, flying from Taiyuan on a special plane of the Civil Aviation Corps, accompanied by Liang Huazhi, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, and Wang Ping, Director of the Finance Department. The special plane landed at the Daxiaochang Air Base, earlier than the originally scheduled arrival time. Those who came to welcome him, after making a fruitless trip, went to the Beijing Office of the Shanxi Provincial Government to pay their respects, including Sun Lianzhong, Chief Military Aide of the Presidential Office representing President Chiang; Duanmu Kai, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan representing President Sun; and Jia Jingde, Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, Guo Chan, Zhang Zhen, and many others. At 4:00 PM, Yan visited President Chiang at his official residence on Huangpu Road and stayed for dinner. He returned to the Provincial Government Office in Beijing at 10:00 PM and had a secret talk with Zhang Qun for 20 minutes. Subsequently, He Chengjun and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, visited him one after another, leaving at 11:30 PM. Yan then drove to the residence specially prepared for him by the President on Ninghai Road to rest.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] After General Yan Xishan arrived in Nanjing, he met with reporters at 11:00 PM on the 28th. According to him, his visit to Nanjing was to request instructions from the President regarding the military food and civilian rations problem in Taiyuan. After meeting with the President in the afternoon, the President gave a clear answer and instructions regarding the rescue of Taiyuan. He did not intend to stay in Nanjing for long and would fly back to Taiyuan to take charge. The defense work of Taiyuan has been more thoroughly prepared, and he believed that even if the bandits increased their forces, it would be safe. When asked by reporters whether the rumors that Lin Biao's bandit troops were gathering in Baoding and attacking Taiyuan were true, Yan said that he had not received such a report. When talking about the current national situation, Yan said that everything depends on human effort. Although there is a crisis, it is not irretrievable. The most important thing at present is to boost military morale and regain popular support. He believed that the future of suppressing the bandits is still optimistic. When reporters asked about his views on the recent rumors of peace, Yan said that he had not heard of any calls for peace in Taiyuan at all. Although he heard of peace rumors after arriving in Nanjing, the source of the rumors is worth noting, and he feared that they were rumors created with a purpose. However, peace is a two-sided matter. Yan repeatedly insisted that the current situation is not hopeless, and everything still depends on human effort.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] General Hu Zongnan arrived at Ming Palace Airport in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 28th, flying from Xi'an on a special air force plane.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The flying of generals such as Yan Xishan and Hu Zongnan to the capital shows that a meeting on how to conduct more effective combat will be convened in the coming days. It is said that Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi will stay in Beiping and may not come to Nanjing. According to military officials in the Presidential Office, peace talks are difficult, so the future situation will be an even more arduous and bitter battle. Furthermore, the military speculated that the 5th Column of Lin Biao's troops gathered in Baoding might advance westward to attack Taiyuan or southward to attack Xi'an. In this way, the Communist bandits clearly want to implement a steady and secure fighting method, rather than an adventurous act of directly attacking Nanjing and Shanghai by taking advantage of the opportunity.

[Another Dispatch] All members of the Legislative Yuan are scheduled to hold a tea party at 4:00 PM on the 29th in the Second Chess Hall of the National Assembly Hall to welcome Yan Xishan.

### Appealing for Effective Assistance to Anti-Aggression Individuals; Yan's Statement Determines to Defend Taiyuan; Pointing out That the Chinese Communist Party Is Indeed Marxist

[United Press, This City Dispatch] General Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters and Chairman of Shanxi Province, who has defended the isolated city of Taiyuan for five months, sent a telegram to United Press on the 28th, saying: In the past five months, he has repelled all attacks by the Communist Party on Taiyuan and guaranteed to continue fighting to the end.

Yan especially warned American people who misunderstand the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party, saying: "The CCP is indeed a Marxist, firmly believes in the words and spirit of communism, and will put it into practice when the opportunity arises." He said: "The red threat in China is a threat to the entire Far East, Japan, and China."

Yan summarized the situation in Taiyuan and the way to reverse the situation as follows:

"The Communist Party has done everything possible to capture Taiyuan, but has never stepped into the city gate. We have repelled all offensives that the Communist army can launch and have decided to continue to defend it."

Yan appealed to those who oppose totalitarianism to effectively assist this war-threatened area. He said: "In fact, Taiyuan has become an isolated island in a red ocean."

Yan Lists Five Needs

Yan also listed five needs: (1) Supplies should be airlifted by 35 aircraft, flying back and forth twice a day, carrying 250 tons of food and 50 tons of military supplies, as well as 50 tons of raw materials for the factories in Taiyuan City to produce; (2) Revive the American Volunteer Air Force under the leadership of General Chennault. He said: "All the people here have great confidence in General Chennault and hope that the authorities can give General Chen a chance." (Note: General Chennault once boasted that if the Flying Tigers were reorganized, he would relieve the siege of Taiyuan within three days.) (3) 150 tons of TNT and 30 tons of smokeless gunpowder are needed every month; (4) 250 tons of food are needed every day; (5) "We need mountain guns, artillery, ammunition, and chemical weapons, because our arsenals cannot manufacture these weapons."

Yan continued: "The above are the supplies we need, but we need more spiritual support. We hope that those who oppose aggression can fully understand our position, sympathize with us, and give us assistance."

American People's Viewpoints Are Wrong

"Some American people have been deceived by the CCP's false propaganda, believing that the Communist Party will maintain friendly relations with all members of the United Nations (including the United States). Therefore, they believe that even if the Communist Party controls all of China, there is no need to care. This kind of hope is actually just a castle in the air. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the Communist army was assigned to my command by the central government, I learned a painful lesson from the Communist Party. I know from experience that the Communist Party goes back on its word and does not match its words with its actions.

"The Communist Party believes that all capitalistic countries are their enemies, and that deceiving enemies is a matter of course. Therefore, they do everything possible to deceive. They are trained in this and put it into practice. They believe that the more deception, the more success they can achieve, and they seem to have come to a conclusion that their enemies will never understand their true strategy."

"Moreover, a few people mistakenly believe that the Chinese Communist Party is not a Marxist and may be a second Tito. This erroneous view is due to ignorance of the facts behind the Iron Curtain. But just a visit to the Communist-occupied areas of this province will reveal what they are doing."

"The Chinese Communist Party is indeed a true Marxist, firmly believes in the words and spirit of communism, and will put it into practice when the opportunity arises. I have had a lot of contact with the Communist Party, so I fully understand them, because I once served as their commander during the War of Resistance Against Japan."

"The philosophy of communism is absurd. In theory, the communists believe that they are doctors who diagnose social diseases. But unfortunately, they prescribe the wrong medicine. Before the patient is saved, there is a risk of killing the patient."

Finally, Yan wished everyone a "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 28th Dispatch] The ancient city has passed half a month in the flames of war. The citizens are calm and their lives are normal, but the wartime scenes that have arisen due to the needs of the war are gradually increasing. Defense works have been built in the streets and alleys, and the airport in the city is filled with smoke. The fuselage scrapes the rooftops, shaking people's hearts. The large glass windows of shops, residences, and organs are covered with white strips of paper to prevent them from being shattered. The paper strips in the shop windows of large stores are painted with artistic patterns, creating a strong contrast between war and peace with the displayed goods. Dongdan, Qianmen, and Wangfujing are still crowded with people every afternoon, bustling like shuttles. Cinemas, Peking opera theaters, and variety shows are booming. Recently, the sound of artillery has gradually subsided, the war outside the city has developed, and the rise in prices has slowed down.

### War in Northern Anhui Remains Quiet; Air Force Continues to Airdrop Food and Ammunition to Du's Troops; Scattered Bandits on Both Sides of the Bengbu-Pukou Railway Have Been Eliminated

According to the General Suppression Headquarters' announcement today, in the recent Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield, there have been only outpost battles on the north and south lines.

Every transport plane has received strict orders from Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou that the task must be accomplished, so the fuel tanks are exhausted when returning to land. Military sources pointed out that the rear comfort from the Comfort Association is far less effective than immediately handing over all kinds of dry food that can be eaten to the Joint Logistics Headquarters for airdrop support to Du's troops. The effect of this comfort achievement is better than forming 100,000 new troops to defend the Huai River.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 27th Dispatch] The Suppression Headquarters announced: (1) There are no scattered bandits on both sides of the Bengbu-Pukou Railway, and traffic has completely resumed.

The full text of the regulations consists of five articles, the main points of which are: calculating the tax rate based on the average salt price at important locations in each production and sales region across the country, deducting the actual required cost after reducing the original tax amount, and dividing the tax rates into three categories according to their uses: A. Edible salt and sea salt are taxed at 70%, well salt is taxed at 10% within Guizhou Province, and generally taxed at 30%, and earth salt and gypsum salt are taxed at 20%. B.

Editorial

### Bizarre Rumors · Absurd Arguments

The editorial of the Central Daily News in the capital city the day before yesterday severely criticized the rumors in the Shanghai market, saying that they had become qualitatively changed, transformed into an anti-government propaganda movement, and hoped that the local government and security agencies would immediately clear out the bandits and spies and deal with them decisively. These arguments are in line with what we feel in our hearts. However, one sentence in the Central Daily News is completely wrong!

The Capital Central Daily News said: "Anyone can let the government fall, only Shanghainese cannot let the government fall." How strange! We want to ask: Who can let the government fall? And who wants to let the government fall? It goes without saying that Shanghainese cannot let the government fall; can the citizens of the capital let the government fall? Can the officials of the capital let the government fall? Can the people and officials of other provinces and cities let the government fall? Moreover, how many Shanghainese are trying to let the government fall? If it refers to bandit conspiracies, then there are bandits and spies everywhere, not just in Shanghai. If, according to the logic of the editorial of the Capital Central Daily News that "anyone can let the government fall," then people from other places, even the officials of the government, the troops on the front line, and even the reporters of the Capital Central Daily News, are included, "all can let the government fall," and only Shanghainese should be responsible for supporting this government that "anyone" "can let it fall"? Nothing can be more bizarre in substance, more absurd in words, and more comical in argument than this!

Moreover, where did these bizarre rumors of the past few days come from? Everyone should first investigate and find out. Hong Kong is certainly a place for fabricating rumors, but the capital city is probably also a rumor "branch office." The words "glorious peace" were first spoken by important people in the capital city; why were they spoken? Foreign reporters have successively transmitted many telegrams of conversations with important people, which were also sent from the capital city; why were they allowed to send them? Even the British Foreign Office is denying the rumor of "mediation by the four countries of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union," which was also spread by the capital city; why doesn't our responsible cabinet have a single unequivocal statement to refute the rumors? The new cabinet, which everyone has been waiting for for a long time, has held meeting after meeting, discussing and discussing, why hasn't it announced its major policy? All rumors are certainly spread by bandits and spies, but the source of the rumors is that the words and deeds of government officials have given them an opportunity. The Shanghai market is indeed sensitive, but if the government does not rectify itself, does not reflect on itself, and does not take a clear and resolute attitude to eradicate the roots of bizarre rumors, but attributes all the rumors to Shanghainese, as if Shanghainese deliberately want to overthrow the government and therefore spread rumors, that is truly missing the point.

The city of Shanghai has a population of six million, and it is inevitable that there will be dregs mixed in, and even more inevitable that there will be bandits and spies lurking, but there are also many citizens of Shanghai who are enthusiastic, enterprising, and brave in saving themselves and the country. Moreover, the support of Shanghai's various legal organizations for the head of state and the implementation of national policies is clearly seen and heard by everyone in the world. What has Shanghai done to betray the country? At the beginning of the implementation of the new financial policy, the Shanghainese were the most enthusiastic in paying gold, silver, and foreign currencies, and the Shanghainese were the most strict in adhering to the price limit policy and selling out their goods. However, the Shanghainese were also the ones who suffered the most and lost the most vitality later. But the Shanghainese are still brave in consoling the soldiers, brave in rescuing refugees, brave in defending the local area, and brave in saving themselves and the country. What has Shanghai done to betray the government? Looking at the atmosphere of the City Council meeting currently being held these days, the confidence and courage of the Shanghainese probably surpass those of other places, and there are no signs of hoping for the government to fall. As the Central Daily News said, "Shanghai's prosperity was created under the protection of the government;" but it should also be known that the huge amount of taxes paid by Shanghainese has contributed to the government's ability to sustain itself until now. We dare to say that Shanghai will not let others surpass it in sincerely supporting the central government.

In short, today, if we want to prevent China from being controlled by communist totalitarianism, from becoming an appendage of the "Iron Curtain," and to prevent Chinese people from becoming international slaves and cattle, we can only have the masses of people who love a free life unite together in solidarity to curb the spread of communist bandits' forces. Every Chinese person has a responsibility, and Shanghainese are certainly no exception; however, it is definitely not that other "anyone can let the government fall." If the government really wants to eradicate rumors and clarify public opinion, please start by purging the defeatist and pro-peace elements in the government. If we don't start from this point, but blame the Shanghainese who "just listen to it," we are truly abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial.

Committee members are also dispatched to implement, execute, supervise, and assess. In addition, local people with leadership skills are hired to assist in the work. As for the candidates for county magistrates, who are most important to the local area, methods for requesting appointments have also been formulated to select and appoint honest, capable, and impartial people.

### President Truman Delivers Speech Condemning Soviet Violation of Agreements; Willing to Seek Understanding Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union During His Term

[United Press International, Kansas City, Missouri, 27th] President Truman, in a speech at a banquet here today, accused the Soviet Union of failing to comply with agreements and obstructing the realization of peace. However, he also stated that some leaders of the Soviet government were eager for understanding with the United States. It is worrying that this great ally has a seemingly self-contradictory moral concept. Treaties are not sacred in the eyes of the Soviet government. In the next four years, I will devote myself to gaining understanding with the Soviet leaders in order to ensure peace. I am well aware of the various problems in Israel and the rest of the world, and I hope that all difficulties can eventually be resolved. The entire situation has arisen because one of our great wartime allies has failed to establish an understanding and lay the foundation for world peace. I am certain that no agreement reached in Potsdam and Yalta has been adhered to by the Soviet government. Such behavior by the people of a great power is a hidden danger. I am confident that if the Soviet people had a say in the government, the aforementioned agreements would be observed. According to diplomatic sources in Washington, the Soviet leaders referred to by Truman likely include Premier Stalin and former Ambassador to the United States Molotov. The President affectionately referred to Stalin as "Old Joe" and described him as a prisoner of the Politburo.

[Associated Press] Speaking of the situation in the Near East, Truman said, "There is no reason for any disagreement between Christians, Jews, and Arabs. The basic doctrine of Christianity is based on the Mosaic doctrine of fairness." He continued, saying that the Soviet Union had become a "stumbling block" in the path of peace in the Near East, and said, "The entire situation is affected by one thing, that one of our allies has failed to adopt a coordinated approach to promote world peace."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] The U.S. State Department declined to comment in detail on President Truman's accusation that the Soviet Union had failed to comply with the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. However, officials from the department discussed the various facts of Soviet violations published in a report submitted to Congress in November of this year, including three related to China, ten to Germany, four to Korea, two to Romania, six to Bulgaria, three to Hungary, seven to Austria, and one to Poland. At that time, the Soviet Union was accused of destruction and removal of industrial equipment worth $858 million from the Northeast, providing weapons and ammunition captured from Japan to the Chinese Communists, failing to provide assistance to the Chinese central government, and preventing China from establishing administrative agencies in Dalian.

### Views from Various Quarters: Truman Must Have Obtained New Intelligence on Internal Rifts in the Soviet Union; Purpose of Speech Likely to Probe for Peace

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Diplomatic sources expressed bewilderment and interest in President Truman's statement that some Soviet leaders are eager to understand the United States. They believe that the President's remarks clearly imply a rift among the members of the all-powerful Soviet Politburo, but no one here can say whether this is new information obtained from intelligence agencies or outside sources, or merely the President's expression of his old views on the state of affairs within the Kremlin.

The second interpretation is based on the President's speech to crowds at a train station in Umatilla, Oregon on June 11th, when the President declared, "I am fond of Stalin, but when he reaches some agreements and is ready to abide by them, they (referring to the Politburo) do not allow him to do so." News of divisions among Soviet leaders is not new, but many Soviet observers believe that these differences are personal rather than ideological. Blum, who will become chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the next term, said that he also believes that some groups in the Soviet Union want to cooperate with the United States, but he said: "The controlling faction has adopted the wrong attitude, making it impossible for people who want to take the right action to express their own ideas." Blum said he was deeply encouraged by President Truman's promise to work towards an understanding with the Soviet Union in the next four years. He pointed out: "If the Soviet government will allow the world to maintain peace and security, the only way to do so is through direct expressions like the one taken by President Truman." Minsfield (Democrat), a member of the House Committee, said that the President's declaration that he believes peace is possible is extremely "encouraging."

### Soviet Concentration Camps

13 Million People Detained

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th] U.S. Secretary of the Army Royall, who had visited England, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Austria in the past three weeks, left here today to return to the United States. Before leaving, he said that according to reliable information, there are currently 13 million people detained in Soviet concentration camps, excluding German prisoners of war, including 9 million Russians and another 2 million Germans.

### Stalin's Warning

[Associated Press, Moscow, 28th] The Soviet Army's mouthpiece, "Red Star," reminded the Soviet Army in an editorial on the 28th that Stalin had warned, "As long as capitalist encirclement exists, the danger of wars of aggression and attacks on the Soviet Union will always exist."

### U.S. Military Defense of South Korea Will Not Affect Korean Security

Announced by South Korean President Syngman Rhee

[United Press International, Seoul, 28th] South Korean President Syngman Rhee said today that the transfer of U.S. occupation forces in South Korea, which will be replaced by other troops, will not affect Korean security. We do not ask for a specific number of U.S. troops to remain in Korea, but only that the United States maintain a substantial force in Korea until South Korea completes its military buildup.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 28th] Here, after discovering soldiers of the U.S. 7th Division, it was learned that a portion of the U.S. military has withdrawn from Korea. The 7th Division was stationed near the 38th parallel shortly after Japan surrendered. It has been rumored for months that the 11th Airborne Division will be replaced by one of the two U.S. divisions stationed in Korea, and the other division remaining in Korea is the 6th Infantry Division.

### Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy Assassinated; Assassin Named Hassan, Member of Muslim Brotherhood

[Associated Press, Cairo, 28th] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy was assassinated by a university student at 7:57 AM Greenwich Mean Time on the 28th (3:57 PM Shanghai time). According to police investigations, the assassin, named Hassan, is a member of a Muslim nationalist group that has been banned. He is a veterinary student who disguised himself as an Egyptian police captain and fired six shots at Nokrashy at close range, hitting him with five bullets. Nokrashy died on the spot.

The tragic incident occurred near the elevator of the Egyptian Ministry of Interior. It is believed that students have repeatedly engaged in political demonstrations that bordered on terrorism. Nokrashy resolutely suppressed them. Earlier this month, Nokrashy also ordered the ban of the Muslim Brotherhood. The assassination of Nokrashy is likely a retaliatory act. The Brotherhood has been accused by the government of inciting students to engage in terrorist activities and has been declared an illegal organization, and its leaders have been arrested. The Brotherhood claims to have one million members, but the actual number is likely much smaller.

Details of the Assassination

In addition to serving as Prime Minister, Nokrashy also served as Minister of Interior and Minister of Finance. According to preliminary reports, when Nokrashy and his adjutant arrived at the Ministry of Interior, the tall, handsome, and young assassin had been loitering in the ministry for some time. Guards wanted to question him, but were stopped by another police officer named Rab, who said, "Let him go, look, he is an officer!" Nokrashy and his adjutant went up the steps and encountered the assassin near the elevator. The assassin saluted and then drew a gun from his bag and fired. Police said the assassin intended to commit suicide, but was arrested before pulling the trigger.

Nokrashy's Achievements

Nokrashy took office as Prime Minister on December 10, 1946, and was known as the "tough guy" of Egypt. He was born in Alexandria in 1888 and had previously served as Prime Minister for a period of two years, during which he took many major measures, such as severing relations between Britain and Egypt. Under his leadership, Egypt filed a complaint against Britain with the United Nations Security Council and sent Egyptian troops into Palestine. News of Nokrashy's assassination spread rapidly in Cairo, and police reinforcements were dispatched to the Ministry of Interior to prevent public unrest. It is expected that the assassination will cause a great political reaction in London, Paris, Tel Aviv, Amman, and the capitals of countries involved in the Palestinian conflict.

### Security Council Orders the Immediate Release of the Indonesian President and Political Prisoners; Soviet Proposal for Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Rejected

[This newspaper reported] Paris, 28th Broadcast: The Security Council has ordered the Netherlands to "immediately" release the Indonesian President and other political prisoners and report on the progress within 24 hours. A proposal submitted by China requesting the Dutch government to release Indonesian political prisoners was passed with eight votes in favor and zero votes against (Britain, France, and Belgium abstained).

[Associated Press, Paris, 77th] The United Nations Security Council on the 27th rejected a Soviet proposal to order the Netherlands to withdraw its troops in Indonesia to their positions before the outbreak of hostilities eight days ago. The Soviet proposal received only five votes in favor, but required seven votes to pass. Last week, abstentions by the Soviet Union and France led to the failure of a similar U.S. proposal.

The five countries that supported the proposal were China, the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Colombia, and Syria. The United States, Britain, France, Canada, Belgium, and Argentina all abstained. A Soviet proposal to order the Netherlands to cease fire within 24 hours also failed to pass, with only four votes in favor. Colombia abstained this time. U.S. Representative Jessup, commenting on the East-West rivalry in the Security Council, said: "I do not wish to place other delegations in a false position. The U.S. position on the Indonesian issue is clear to the world." Ukrainian Representative Tarasenko declared: "Without U.S. financial assistance, the Netherlands would not have been able to launch the Indonesian war. The U.S. government cannot escape responsibility." Soviet Representative Malik, after the vote, made a brief and sharp statement: "It is very clear that Britain and the United States want to avoid taking effective action." Earlier, when the Dutch representative refused to inform the Security Council whether the Dutch government would comply with the ceasefire order of the 24th, Malik proposed ordering the Netherlands to cease fire within 24 hours and withdraw its troops to their original positions before the current "police action." Colombia also submitted a proposal, which will be discussed on the 28th, to order the current mediation committee in Indonesia to report to the Security Council on compliance with the 24th ceasefire order. The proposal will also instruct the mediation committee to report on "the situation in areas currently under military occupation, or the situation in areas where the occupying forces can currently withdraw."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The Chinese delegation to the Security Council this morning submitted a motion on the Indonesian issue, urging the Security Council to pay attention to the fact that the Dutch government has not yet complied with the December 24th resolution to release Indonesian President Sukarno and other political prisoners and submit a report to the Security Council on accepting the resolution within 24 hours.

### Security Council to End Tomorrow; Resume in the U.S. Early Next Year

[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] The Security Council resolved that the Council will end its work in Paris on December 30 and continue its meeting at Lake Success on January 6 next year. If the work of the Security Council ends earlier than the 29th, the Security Council meeting to be held at Lake Success early next year can also start earlier if an emergency occurs.

### British Representative Suggests to Security Council Issuing an Immediate Ceasefire Order for Arab-Jewish Conflict; Bunche Report Confirms Jewish Forces Provoked

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The Security Council reopened this morning to discuss the Palestinian issue, first reading a telegram from the Egyptian Foreign Minister denouncing the Israeli army's violation of the Nitzanim truce, followed by two reports from acting mediator Bunche, who also stated that Israel's attack on the Nitzanim area stated that "There was no provocation from the Egyptian side." Bunche also expressed regret that the Israeli army is currently restricting the activities of UN observers.

[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] British Representative Bevin called on the Security Council on the 28th to order an immediate ceasefire in Palestine and to have the Jewish forces withdraw to their positions in the Nitzanim area in October. Bevin submitted a motion to the Security Council, limiting the Jewish and Egyptian armies to accept the Security Council's order by January 2. The proposal called for a meeting of the Security Council sub-committee to be convened on that day to determine whether both sides had complied with the order. Bevin said, "It is clear that Israel is responsible for violating the ceasefire order."

### Netherlands Requests the Economic Cooperation Administration to Restore Aid to Indonesia; Wallace Calls on the U.S. to Stop Aid to the Netherlands

[United Press International, The Hague, 27th] The Dutch government announced today that Ambassador to the United States Kleffens has sent a letter to the Director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman, requesting the restoration of the agency's aid to Indonesia. After the Dutch military offensive in Indonesia, the Economic Cooperation Administration announced that it would suspend aid pending clarification of the situation in Indonesia. [Associated Press, New York, 27th] Wallace demanded on the 27th that the United States stop sending arms and Marshall Plan aid to the Netherlands. Wallace condemned the UN's Indonesian ceasefire order as a "hypothetical and deliberately ineffective gesture." Wallace also accused the United States of being largely responsible for the Dutch attack on Indonesia. Wallace also declared: The Netherlands must be forced to withdraw from Indonesia and guarantee Indonesian independence.

### Six Countries Complete Draft Agreement on Ruhr Industrial Control; Security Agency Established to Cooperate with the Ruhr Authority

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] According to the London Agreement of 1948, the conference of six countries authorized to establish the Ruhr International Authority today issued a final communiqué by representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The representatives of the six countries met in London and have now completed the draft agreement, which is ready to be submitted to their respective governments for approval. At the outset, the representatives agreed on how many institutions Germany should establish and how they should be created. The Ruhr Authority is only one of them and should be drafted from this perspective. To avoid duplication and overreach, each of these institutions should have its own specific task, and as a whole, it should have the following three objectives: (1) Guarantee German disarmament and demilitarization; (2) Promote European recovery, including democratic Germany; (3) Improve the close links of economic life in all countries. This is the only requirement to ensure peace and prosperity in Europe. Among the measures to prevent aggression, the establishment of the Security Agency is the most important measure. The task of this bureau was recently agreed upon in principle by the three military governments. The three military governments also decided to cooperate with the Ruhr Authority. The Security Agency will be fully responsible for disarmament and demilitarization. Regarding the issue of dismantling military industries, the bureau should act in accordance with the agreement on prohibiting and restricting German industry, which is about to be completed. The agreement stipulates that the maximum amount of crude steel production in the two occupied zones of Germany is 10.7 million tons. The most important goal of establishing the Ruhr Authority is to ensure that Ruhr resources will not be used for aggression in the future, but only for peaceful purposes and in line with the economic life of neighboring countries, including Germany. During the period when the occupying forces have great control over the German economy, the handling of all German affairs should be largely the responsibility of the occupying forces, but after the occupying forces withdraw, the German government will gradually be directly responsible. One of the main tasks of the new Ruhr Authority is to allocate Ruhr coal and steel for German consumption and to meet the production needs of the countries participating in the meeting in London.

### U.S. Military Government Decides to Supervise Japanese Election Affairs

Ashida Announced that He Will Participate in the Election While in Prison

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] The Japanese general election for the House of Representatives will be held on the 23rd of next month, and the election campaign has already begun. U.S. military government teams began supervising election affairs throughout the country on the 28th. The supervision will also include investigating polling stations before, during, and after the general election, as well as during the counting of ballots. Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida registered to run in his hometown of Kochi Prefecture, Shikoku.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] Former Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida's cabinet resigned due to repeated corruption cases during his term, and he himself is also suspected of being on trial. Ashida had originally announced his intention to retire from politics, but he reversed his previous statement on the 28th and decided to participate in the general election for the House of Representatives from behind bars. He did not want to be listed as a nominated candidate for his Liberal Party and applied to run in the Kyoto district.

### Shigeru Yoshida Hopes Japanese Goods Will Be Sold to China

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] At a press conference on the 27th, Yoshida made a statement on the situation in China, saying: It is currently difficult to predict the development of the situation in China. Generally speaking, it can be divided into two major areas controlled by the Nationalists and the Communists. These two areas will continue to confront each other for a considerable period of time. From Japan's point of view, there are some materials in the areas controlled by the Communists that Japan needs, and at the same time, Japan hopes to export a large number of materials to China.

### Yugoslavia's Regulations and the West: Resuming Trade Relations to Break the Eastern European Economic Embargo

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 27th] Tito, in his speech to the joint session of Parliament today, condemned the Cominform countries for implementing an economic embargo against Yugoslavia in an attempt to hinder the country's industrialization, which he said violated the treaties they had signed with Yugoslavia. He added that these countries were trying to turn Yugoslavia into a purely agricultural country, so they could buy food from it. Yugoslavia is now trying to break the embargo by Eastern countries and trade with Western countries in order to purchase the machinery necessary to implement its economic plans. Since some People's Democratic countries have violated their agreements, we have had to sell our products to capitalist countries in order to purchase machinery. However, it must be stated that Yugoslavia's exchange of goods with Western countries is based on equality and without political conditions. Tito also denied that the majority of Yugoslavia's products are sold to Western countries. Tito then presented the 1949 budget proposal, which is 37 billion dinars (Yugoslav currency) more than the 1948 budget, and indicated that the military budget will be increased to develop the arms industry and improve housing for military officers. Following Tito's speech, Finance Minister Raiduza Lirivi-Kru announced that the total amount of the 1949 budget would reach 161 billion dinars. Tito finally listed the main tasks for 1949 as: (1) building industry, (2) modernizing mining, (3) developing the arms industry and building housing for military officers, (4) improving railway transportation, and (5) modernizing agriculture. Tito also said in his speech that Yugoslavia's trade with Western countries is only imitating what other Eastern countries are doing, such as the Soviet Union and Poland, so these countries have no reason to criticize Yugoslavia.

### First Meeting of the Senate: Mayor Reports on Administration, Gendarmerie Brigade to Establish a Regiment First, Funds Allocated to Expedite the Construction of City Defense Works

[Report from this newspaper] The 8th meeting of the first session of the Municipal Senate was held at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. Speaker Pan, Vice Speaker Xu, and 152 senators were present. Mayor Wu, directors of various bureaus, and more than 30 others were in attendance. The meeting began with a report from the Senate Secretariat, and the agenda for the meeting was approved. The Speaker then appointed seven senators—Chen Boliang, Gao Shuan, Chen Peide, Ji Hao, Jiang Haoran, Fei Shusheng, and Chen Deying—to draw lots to determine the seating order of the senators. Then, Mayor Wu gave a report on the administration and answered questions from the senators. After a ten-minute break, Mayor Wu answered the questions one by one, and then the questions and answers from the Finance, Public Utilities, and Public Works Bureaus began. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m. The second meeting will continue at 3 p.m. today to raise questions and answers from the Education, Police, Social Affairs, Land Administration, Civil Affairs, and Health Bureaus.

Yesterday, Mayor Wu gave a comprehensive report on the aspects of civil affairs, police affairs, social affairs, health, finance, education, public works, public utilities, and land administration as follows: (1) Civil Affairs: A. The general census of the city's population on November 8 was successful, which is very helpful for local self-defense work. B. The self-defense force has been established and is being carried out simultaneously in 30 districts. The participants have excellent morale. Basic military education is scheduled to be given within three months to ensure local security. (2) Police Affairs: A. The organization of the gendarmerie brigade has been delayed several times due to funding issues, but now there is progress. After consulting with Commander Chen of the Gendarmerie Command, it has been decided to immediately establish a regiment of about 1,900 people, which will be expanded later. B. City defense works. Since Commander Chen arrived in Shanghai, he has advocated that city defense works must be expedited. The authorities have now allocated 97 million yuan to begin construction. C. Air defense work. Air defense stations have been established, and a budget has been included for this year and will also be included for next year. D. Police treatment. Efforts are being made to improve it at any time. Recently, the city government is considering the issue of year-end bonuses. After consultation with various sectors, it was decided to raise self-defense funds through the following three methods: (1) Increasing the land price tax by 5 per mille, (2) Collecting product consolation donations, (3) Withdrawing 2/10 of the goods to be returned from the sealed materials.

### Please Do Not Misunderstand the Highs and Lows of the Index; Relief and Consolation Efforts Are Being Actively Carried Out

(3) Social Affairs: A. After the price limits were lifted, there were many labor-management disputes. After the cost of living index was published, the labor side thought it was too low, while the management side found it unbearable. Moreover, there was much suspicion from all sides about the veracity of the cost of living index. In fact, the Cost of Living Index Review Committee is composed of representatives from all sectors, so it is impossible to fabricate it. It is hoped that all parties will not misunderstand. B. The issue of year-end bonuses is also very difficult. At present, various industries are declining. While the authorities sympathize with the lives of workers, the burden on the management side should also be taken into account. Efforts are being made to assist industrial loans to resolve the crisis. C. Relief and consolation work is currently underway. Eight porridge distribution centers have been opened. Nighttime corpse collection and mobile shelters are being organized. In addition, there are two issues related to the Social Affairs Bureau: (1) The work of consoling the soldiers at the front is being carried out enthusiastically under the leadership of Chairman Fang, and their spirit is admirable. (2) Rice and grain issue. Since the rice rush occurred, I have tried my best to ensure that the amount of rice in storage is sufficient. At present, the city has enough rice for one and a half months, and efforts are being made to increase it. There is absolutely no shortage of rice sources now. (4) Education: A. In accordance with the resolution of the previous Senate meeting, the number of classes is being gradually increased. Thirty-seven classes have been added to middle schools, and 161 classes have been added to national education. B. I regret the general leave of absence incident that occurred due to the poor treatment of teachers and staff. Strictly speaking, although the lives of teachers and staff are indeed difficult, are the lives of ordinary civil servants not difficult? After the general leave of absence incident occurred, I am very grateful for the assistance of the private primary and secondary school teachers' associations in resolving the issue.

### Finances Are Extremely Difficult

(5) Finance: The city government's finances are extremely difficult. In October, it barely managed to get through with a subsidy of 8 million yuan from the central government. In November, it borrowed money from the National Bank to get by. The difficulties can be imagined. However, the city government is absolutely unwilling to increase the burden on citizens and will only urge the Finance Bureau to work hard to collect the existing tax items. (6) Public Works: A. The Wuzhen Road Bridge held a traffic opening ceremony this morning, which is clear proof that public officials are not corrupt. How so? The original budget for the bridge was 7.2 billion, but it was completed today by selling 100,000 cement sacks. If public officials were corrupt, the cement sacks would not need to be sold. B. The seawall project has made considerable progress to date. The U.S. originally allocated 300,000 U.S. dollars as funding, but it is now difficult to disburse the funds, which may be interrupted. Negotiations are underway. C. The Zhongshan South Road project. I am deeply grateful to the local citizens for voluntarily demolishing their houses to help the authorities complete the reconstruction.

### Public Utilities Must Be Guaranteed

(7) Public Utilities: The Public Utilities Bureau is about to enter a period of being scolded again, because the prices of public utilities are about to be adjusted again. The price of foreign exchange coal has been increasing continuously for two months, which has had a significant impact on costs. The city government must take into account the burden on citizens, but it must also make efforts to maintain public utilities. Therefore, the authorities have decided to provide concrete guarantees for the future of public utilities. (8) Land Administration: Due to the tense situation, property owners are rushing to obtain their title deeds, which has made the work of the Land Administration Bureau particularly busy. Criticism from all sectors of the bureau is unanimously considered to be too slow. I personally went to the bureau to inspect and study the reasons for its slowness. I learned that the bureau has received 120,000 to 130,000 title deeds in the past two years, and 100,000 have been issued. There are still 20,000 that have not been completed, and 3,000 of them cannot be processed due to various incomplete procedures and documents. In order to eliminate corruption, I hope that senators will report any corruption they find, and the city government will thoroughly investigate and deal with it. (9) Health: A. The progress of the city's epidemic prevention work can be expressed in terms of the number of injections. This year, the Health Bureau has vaccinated 2.61 million people against cholera and 2.36 million people against smallpox. The fact that epidemics have not been prevalent this year is by no means without merit. B. The problem of garbage removal is serious. The city's population has doubled compared to before the war, while the number of garbage collectors has decreased by a quarter. Recently, due to the curfew, the Suzhou River is severely congested, hindering the navigation of garbage ships. The authorities are now trying to dredge it.

### Senators Raise Questions

Senators raised questions: (1) Wang Liben: After the general leave of absence of primary and secondary school teachers, in addition to each person receiving one pound of wool yarn, the rest have not been cashed. Why not change the price and distribute the confiscated sealed materials? (2) Zhang Zhongyuan: The work of Pushan Villa is excellent, but it is now facing extreme financial difficulties. Please subsidize the city government. (3) Fei Shusheng: The rice distribution price for November is set too high, which is enough to affect price increases. Also, why have the prices of public utilities recently increased so much? Moreover, in this severe situation, should the mayor, as the mayor, firmly defend Shanghai, and should there be a clear expression of this? (4) Zhang Xuelian: The newly issued national identity cards have 144 purchase certificates attached, but they have not been cashed. Why? (5) Special elements are rushing to exchange gold, and scattered soldiers are forcibly selling towels. The authorities should stop them immediately. (6) Jiang Haoran: Where is the 100 billion yuan in legal tender previously fined for excessive electricity use, which was originally intended for the gendarmerie brigade? (7) Ding Shanming: A large number of troops have recently arrived in the suburbs. The authorities should find ways to increase their non-staple food expenses. (8) Huang Bingquan: The members of the Suppression and Construction Brigade should be prohibited from forcibly occupying civilian houses. (9) Zhang Zhihan: How should the materials of Yangzi Company be handled? (10) Yan Esheng: The authorities must ensure that the purchase and storage of grain and fuel are sufficient, and attention should also be paid to self-defense work. (11) Jiang Hao: Beggars are filling the bridgeheads and should be taken in immediately. (12) Tong Xiang: When people are rushing to exchange gold and silver, the police are arbitrarily beating people and should be stopped immediately. (13) Qu Yue: According to the central government's regulations, gold is not allowed to be freely bought and sold, so exchanging gold is equivalent to buying antiques. The method is obviously unreasonable, and local governments should have the right to amend it before implementing it. (14) Chu Shun: The city government should do its best to deal with the aftermath of the Jiangya Wheel disaster. (15) Zhu Shujian: There are too many refugees in the city, and they should be taken in as soon as possible.

### Mayor Answers Questions: Rice Distribution Prices Cannot Be Too Low; Public Utilities Can Be Audited

Mayor Wu answered the questions as follows: (1) The supplies for primary and secondary school teachers, such as cigarettes and cooking oil, can be distributed immediately, but the procedures still need to be negotiated and decided by the Social Affairs Bureau and various associations. (2) Subsidies can be given to Pushan Villa within the possible range. (3) U.S. aid rice is not relief rice, and the price cannot be too low. The price increase of public utilities can be publicly audited. I am the chief local civil official. When the Communist Party released the blacklist yesterday, I was already on it. There seems to be no need to doubt whether I can stay in Shanghai. (4) The distribution certificates for the new national identity cards were formulated by the Economic Supervision Office, and the city government cannot be responsible for them. (5) Special elements rushing to exchange gold and scattered soldiers forcibly selling goods will be strictly investigated and banned by the Gendarmerie Department. (6) The fine of 100 billion legal tender has been used by the Public Utilities Bureau to purchase street lamp materials. (7) The non-staple food expenses for the troops stationed in the suburbs should be suggested to the Ministry of National Defense to issue in kind. (8) The members of the Suppression and Construction Brigade who forcibly occupy civilian houses will be stopped by the Gendarmerie Department. (9) The Yangzi case was originally under the supervision of the Economic Supervision Office. After the office was abolished, I immediately ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it in accordance with the law. (10) The authorities are also paying close attention to the issue of storing grain and fuel and are trying to enrich it. (11) Beggars on the street can start to be taken in immediately. (12) Police beating gold exchangers will be guaranteed not to happen again in the future. (13) The gold exchange method was formulated by the central government, and local governments can only contribute reference opinions. (14) The city government will do its best to assist in the aftermath of the Jiangya Wheel disaster. (15) The work of providing relief to refugees is actively underway.

Finance

Bureau's Questions and Answers: Zhu Shujian said that the car license tax is too low. Why not increase it? Director Tian replied that the car license tax rate is set by the central government, and local governments have no right to modify it. However, he heard that the central government has also considered this recently and has formulated a new method. He has sent a letter to the central government to inquire about the contents of the new method.

Public Utilities

Bureau Questions and Answers: (1) Shi Qian said, why not restore the 16th Road trolleybus? (2) Chen Kai: Why not open the bus from Longhua Jingji Bridge to Xujiahui? (3) Zhu Shujian: What is the basis for the price adjustment of public utilities? (4) Zhu Hongyi: The public transportation company has been preparing for years, why is there no follow-up? (5) Yu Shun: Why is the allocation of gasoline for cars gradually decreasing? (6) Zhang Zhongyuan: Why has the number of cars on the road not decreased after the gasoline quota has decreased? Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, replied: (1) The road surface from Changchou Road to Caojiadu is badly damaged and is currently being repaired by the Public Works Bureau. The 16th Road will be opened after the repair is completed. (2) The Southeast Automobile Company is urged to expedite the opening of the bus from Longhua to Xujiahui. (3) The calculation of public utility prices is complicated and the Senate is welcome to audit the accounts publicly. (4) The valuation work of the public transportation company is not yet completed and it cannot be established yet. (5) The reduction in gasoline allocation for cars is due to the central government's austerity quota. (6) The number of cars has not decreased after the gasoline reduction, and it is possible that black market oil is being used.

Public Works

Bureau Questions and Answers: (1) Zhu Shujian: The Public Works Bureau repairs roads without a predetermined plan, which is a waste of manpower and materials. (2) Hou Junren: Why not dredge Bailonggang in the suburbs? Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, replied: (1) There is indeed a plan for road repairs, but when the budget is compiled, it is insufficient to purchase materials when the funds are invested. (2) The Bailonggang project is organized by the City Relief Association's work relief office and is not under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Bureau. If you are eager to dredge, local gentry should be responsible.

### The Labor Union Believes That the Housing Rent Standard Is Closely Related to the Cost of Living Index

[Report from this newspaper] The City Federation of Labor Unions held a meeting of the board of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss a number of important cases. (1) Recently, various Baojia have been collecting settlement fees for volunteer soldiers without any standards, ranging from the value of several dou of rice to the value of several shi of rice, which workers cannot afford. It was decided that the principle is that each household with an adult male of conscription age will be charged the value of two dou of rice, and each household without an adult male of conscription age will be charged no more than the value of one dou of rice. The price of rice will be calculated at the distribution price. (2) When there was a rice shortage in the city, the City Social Affairs Bureau borrowed rice from various factories to distribute to workers. Now the bureau is urging the return of the rice. The labor union hopes to return the cash and decided to have Chairman Zhou Xuexiang go to the bureau to meet with Director Wu to discuss the matter, hoping to allow the return of cash, and the discounted price should not exceed the distribution price. (3) In the current formula for compiling the cost of living index, the item of housing rent is still calculated according to the old standard before the currency reform. In fact, after the currency reform, during the price limit period and after the price limit was lifted, housing rents have been adjusted several times. Housing rent accounts for a large percentage of the index. If it is not corrected quickly, it will have a significant impact on the index. It was decided to ask the labor representatives in the Senate to raise the issue and ask for the standard to be revised to avoid workers suffering invisibly.

### Next Cost of Living Index

[Report from this newspaper] Today is the last price survey for the next cost of living index for this month. The price is surveyed twice a week, usually on Tuesdays and Fridays, but the last Friday of this month happens to be the 31st, which is also New Year's Eve. It was decided to change the survey to Mondays and Wednesdays. The price of this month just started to rise in a straight line on the 23rd (Thursday), and the rising trend was even stronger on Friday the next day. Therefore, the change in the survey date has a great impact on the index. The Tai period index will be the standard for general factories to issue year-end awards, which is of great importance. It is expected that disputes may arise in the Cost of Living Index Compilation Review Committee because of this, which will not be as smooth as the previous few times.

### Key Oil Allocation for Workers Will Be Sold Starting Today

[Report from this newspaper] The City Social Affairs Bureau held a meeting yesterday and decided to start selling the first phase of key oil allocation for industrial and professional workers and their families from today until January 15 next year. Each person can purchase one catty with a certificate. The distribution price varies depending on the type of oil: soybean oil and raw oil are 17 yuan per catty, raw vegetable oil is 16 yuan per catty, sesame oil is 15 yuan per catty, and cooked vegetable oil is 13 yuan per catty. The 54 members of the Oil Business Association will handle the sales on behalf of the association.

### Eight Units File Another Petition, Requesting Gold Exchange Without Conclusion

[Report from this newspaper] Eight units, including the Post Office, the Telecommunications Bureau, the Materials Storage and Transportation Department of the Ministry of Transportation, the Transportation Management Committee, the Textile Construction Company, the International No-Stack Radio Station, and the Welfare Associations of the two roads, because they were not allowed to participate in the collective deposit and exchange of gold and silver for public and private employees, had previously sent representatives to petition the National Bank and the City Government separately, requesting the same treatment as public and private employees, but had never succeeded. Yesterday at 11 a.m., the representatives went to the National Bank again to petition. Liu Gongyun received them and the representatives again requested to deposit and exchange gold and silver according to the methods for public and private employees. Liu replied that the improved methods for deposit and exchange are still being studied by the Ministry of Finance, and they will be deposited and exchanged according to the new methods after they are announced. The representatives insisted on handling it in the same way as the city government agencies. The debate continued until noon without a conclusion, and they left disappointed.

### White Russian Refugees: First Batch of 50 People Fly to Japan

### The First U.S. Liner Sailing the Shanghai-Japan Line Will Set Sail on New Year's Day

Each ship has 200 passenger seats. The first ship is scheduled to set sail on January 1 next year.

### The Shanghai-Ningbo Line's Jiangjing Wheel Will Resume Sailing Today

[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Shanghai-Ningbo line liner Jiangjing has completed repairs and will resume sailing to Ningbo at 4:30 p.m. today. Passengers must purchase tickets with their identity cards, and luggage must also be inspected. In addition, the Ping An Company's Dahua Wheel sails from Shanghai to Ningbo every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The ticket purchase procedure is the same as the Jiangjing Wheel.

### During Martial Law and Winter Defense, Gatherings Must Be Reported in Advance

The city government received a letter from the Gendarmerie Command yesterday, stating that it had received a telegram from Tang Enbo, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Jinghu Gendarmerie Headquarters, which stated that the headquarters' jurisdiction had long been declared under martial law, and it was also the winter defense period. All gatherings must be reported to the local highest security agency in advance for approval before they can be held. If there is any violation, in addition to being ordered to disband in accordance with Article 11, Paragraph 1 of the Martial Law, the leading organizers will be severely punished according to law. After the city government approved the letter, it has ordered its subordinates to inform them.

### Tsinghua Alumni Gather for Dinner to Celebrate Birthday: President Mei Talks About the Recent Situation of Tsinghua Garden

[Report from this newspaper] Today is the sixtieth birthday of Mei Yiqi, President of Tsinghua University. The alumni of the university in Shanghai took advantage of President Mei's visit to Shanghai to hold a dinner party at the Tsinghua Alumni Association on Jiujiang Road at 6 p.m. yesterday to celebrate President Mei's birthday. More than 160 alumni including Li Zhaoshi, Sun Ruihuang, Shen Zonglian, Xia Jianbai, Xiang Zhezhen, and Li Jianwu attended. President Mei and his younger brother Mei Yidou attended the meeting. All the alumni sang [Birthday Song] and presented President Mei with a signed commemorative album from the alumni in Shanghai to show their respect. The alumni expressed great concern about the government's announcement that Mei would be the Minister of Education and the situation of the alma mater in the war. President Mei gave a detailed report during the meeting. He said that his trip south was to find ways to help the faculty and students of the northern universities, not to become an official, and he also admitted that he did not have enough talent and experience. Therefore, he firmly declined the government's announcement of his appointment as the Minister of Education and asked the government to select another capable person as soon as possible to avoid the long-term suspension of ministerial affairs. He himself did not intend to come south, because the Handan Broadcasting Station had once reported that after the "liberation," he would still remain as the president of the university. In order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, he flew south on the 21st.

Regarding the situation of Tsinghua Garden, President Mei said: On the 12th of this month, he still believed that the situation would not change drastically. Unexpectedly, on the 13th, he suddenly heard gunfire, and at the same time, a cook was injured by stray bullets. He himself went into the city on the 14th to inquire about the news. Since then, he has not been able to return to the school because he could not pass through the city gate. By the 16th, telephone contact was also cut off. Later, three foreign professors entered the city and claimed that the location of the school had become a "liberated area," but the communist army did not enter the school. The situation in the school was quite stable. To this day, only more than 20 professors and more than 100 students have entered the city, and they are all paid by Peking University's loans and allowed to live on campus and borrow books. There are still more than 2,000 students and 700 to 800 faculty, staff, and family members left in Tsinghua Garden. Regarding materials, the school has nearly 4,000 bags of flour, plus private reserves, which can last for at least a month. According to the foreign professors who entered the city, it is now possible to resume classes. As for the rumor that more than a dozen Tsinghua students were injured by stray bullets while entering the city, it cannot be confirmed and is probably a rumor. At present, the heads of various universities in Beijing, with the assistance of the Ministry of Education, have established a joint office in Beijing for the national universities in Beiping and Tianjin. If the weather turns better, planes will be sent to transport the faculty, staff, and students of various universities to the south for settlement. It is reported that President Mei is scheduled to return to Beijing within today and tomorrow.

### President Wheel Resumes Sailing to Shanghai: Meiqi Will Arrive on New Year's Eve

[Report from this newspaper] The U.S. President Lines Company's vessels sailing the Sino-U.S. Pacific line were suspended for more than three months due to the strike by sailors on the U.S. West Coast. Work resumed at the end of last month and the vessels resumed sailing on schedule.

### Deng Zhonghe's Defamation Case: The District Court Will Continue to Question

[Report from this newspaper] The case of Deng Zhonghe, a giant businessman in the city, being accused of being a traitor by Zhu Zhengwen, was previously approved by the City High Procuratorate to be transferred to the Hangzhou Zhejiang High Procuratorate for further investigation. Zhu Zhengwen, the accuser in the case, claimed at the beginning of the accusation that Deng had held a press conference and published an announcement in various newspapers, accusing him of being an "extortionist bandit" and extortion. Zhu believed that it was Deng's insult, so he filed a private prosecution against Deng in the City District Court for defamation, and the District Court once opened the trial. Because Deng's traitor case was being investigated in Hangzhou, this case was also put on hold and no longer opened. Recently, the Hangzhou High Procuratorate has issued a decision of non-prosecution because the evidence in the case of Zhu accusing Deng of suspicion of being a traitor is insufficient. The Tai City District Court will schedule a second trial in the case of Zhu accusing Deng of defamation in the coming days.

### Sino-American Basketball Match: Ren Yu Barely Wins Against U.S. Navy

[Report from our newspaper] The Sino-American basketball friendly match was held at the City Gymnasium at 7 p.m. last night. As a result, Ren Yu fought hard and defeated O'Stoli with a score of 44 to 41. In the first half, Ren Yu led with 24 to 22.

Although the O' team lost, their fierce defense and fast throws showed no signs of sluggishness. Hu Xiaozi, with a height of six feet, held the position of center and was known for "flying around the court." In terms of stamina, the O' team seemed like bulls, but the court was not heated enough, which was a disadvantage. Throughout the game, the most outstanding players on the O' team were Que, Nieger, and Macdonald. In the first half for Ren Yu, Wu Xinyun was better, while in the second half, Li Zhaohe contributed significantly. The scores of the two teams are recorded as follows:

### Yun Chu Assets Association Charity Fund: Gifted to Middle School Chemistry Teachers, Totaling Approximately 130,000 Yuan

The initial purpose of the Yun Chu Assets Management Committee's Charity Fund is limited to promoting chemical engineering education. The committee believes that the chemistry curriculum in middle schools is the foundation for future chemical engineering education, and currently, chemistry teachers in various schools adhere to their positions in this difficult environment and devote themselves to teaching and serving the nation. Their spirit is truly admirable. Therefore, it has been decided to donate this charity fund to all chemistry teachers in public and private senior and junior middle schools in the city as a "carbon gift" to express appreciation and comfort. Currently, according to the list of chemistry teachers submitted in the survey form of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, there are a total of 323 people in the city. Each person who teaches chemistry for more than six hours per week will be given 400 yuan in gold, and those who teach less than six hours will receive a proportional gift (but this only applies to a very small number of 14 people), totaling approximately 130,000 yuan in gold. After discussions between Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau and the committee, it was decided that the committee would directly deliver the gifts to each person according to the list.

### Verdict in Student Communist Spy Case: Duan Ze Sentenced to Six Months, Remaining Four Acquitted

[Report from our newspaper] The case of students Duan Ze (Tongji), Yang Guichang (Fudan), Ye Jinrong (Jinan), Yin Minzhi (Shanghai Law), and Song Henian (Hua Shi Middle School), who were accused of being Communist spies, was judged yesterday by the Special Criminal Court. Duan Ze was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for participating in an organization aimed at subverting the government. Yang Guichang was found not guilty of endangering the country, and the forgery of documents was not accepted and transferred to the District Court for handling (temporarily allowed bail). Ye Jinrong, Song Henian, and Yin Minzhi were all found not guilty (released in court). The reasoning behind the verdict: Duan Ze was a student at Tongji University and had participated in the Communist Party, lurking within the school and contacting the traitor Li Qun. In August of this year, the party and government organs discovered and arrested him. After investigation, the diary of Li Qun contained records of the defendant's activities, which could be used to determine that he had committed the crime of endangering the country and should be punished. The accusation that Yang Guichang and the other four had subverted the government lacked concrete evidence and could not be accepted, so they could not be wrongly convicted.

### Authorities Meticulously Plan Countermeasures to Channel Speculative Funds and Stabilize Commodity Prices

Recently, the rise in commodity prices in the city has continued unabated. Commodity prices change drastically every day, causing public panic and endless worries. Generally, this phenomenon is attributed to the government's announcement of the suspension of gold and silver exchange. However, according to financial management officials, the main reason for this price increase is still the rampant speculative mentality of speculative funds, coupled with the deliberate agitation of some speculators. They pointed out that recently, speculative funds from the north have been of a considerable amount; in addition, at the beginning of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, some of the funds fleeing from the city to the south have also flowed back to Shanghai recently, causing this sluggish commodity market to experience a price increase beyond the ordinary. They said that the authorities are already formulating a meticulous countermeasure to address this issue. The focus of this new countermeasure will be on guiding speculative funds and tightening credit. They also pointed out that at this time of sluggish transactions, once the overnight interest rate rises, it will force speculators and hoarders to retreat.

[Another dispatch] According to financial management officials, the bureau is currently consulting with the Central Bank on effective ways to guide speculative funds in order to stabilize the market and suppress the rise in commodity prices. At the same time, they have also begun to crack down on the black market for gold notes and the high-priced trading of silver dollars, in conjunction with the Municipal Police Department and other relevant agencies.

Speculative funds from Beijing and Tianjin are fleeing to Shanghai in large quantities, which is extremely turbulent. According to official statistics, the amount of money remitted from the north in the past month has reached nearly 100 million yuan per day, resulting in extremely loose credit in the city. Speculative funds are causing trouble everywhere, and commodity prices are greatly affected. The authorities attach great importance to this and are quickly seeking a solution. Liu Gongyun of the Central Bank told reporters yesterday that short-term treasury bills will be issued in large quantities, and ways will be found to solve the problem of listing. As for the company bond issue previously mentioned, the Central Bank is now considering issuing it.

### Influenced by Price Increases in Other Sectors, Rice Prices Rise Sharply; Flour and Miscellaneous Grains are Firm; Oil Prices Soar

Rice prices rose sharply because the previous day's decline was too great, and prices were close to production prices. Other commodity prices also rose sharply, making people quite bullish. In the southern market, the opening price was 70 to 80 yuan higher. White japonica rice was priced at 535 yuan, and thin indica rice was priced at 540 yuan. After the market closed, it was heard that prices in other sectors had risen, so prices were raised again by 20 yuan. In the northern market, white japonica rice was priced at 550 yuan, and early thin indica rice rose sharply by 90 yuan. Yesterday's arrivals were slightly reduced, with a total of 10,786 stones in the northern and southern markets.

Flour

With rice prices rising and all other commodities rising sharply, the upward trend continued unabated. The opening price for old car flour was as high as 246 yuan, and then, with the absorption of retail investors, it rose further to close at 263 yuan, up 48 yuan. Bingchuan flour was priced at 259 yuan, and Hongfeng and Jiancheng flour each rose by 50 yuan. Wheat bran continued to rise sharply, with large packages rising by 30 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

The upward trend became more severe. Due to rising rice prices, people were already bullish, and the sharp rise in prices in other sectors made the market even tighter, with more purchases than sales. Soybeans rose by 60 to 80 yuan. Corn and red sorghum were easily sold and rose sharply, with the former rising by 100 yuan and the latter rising by 80 yuan, a 40% increase. Mung beans and wheat rose sharply, sesame seeds rose by 100 yuan, and raw peanuts rose sharply by 50%. Yangzheng raw peanuts were priced at 1,250 yuan.

Cooking Oil

Prices rose crazily. Speculative funds poured in, and buying became rampant. After the market opened, prices soared. Soybean oil initially opened at 1,950 yuan and rose to 2,350 yuan at the close, a sharp increase of 670 yuan. Rapeseed oil also broke through the 2,000 yuan mark and closed at 2,250 yuan, with each rising by about 40%. Jitone rapeseed oil rose by 700 yuan, reaching 2,400 yuan. Soybean cake rose slightly after the initial increase, with a total increase of 40 yuan.

### Tea Market is Prosperous

According to tea industry insiders, the year-end of the lunar calendar is approaching, and the industry's credit feels tighter. However, due to the depletion of tea stocks, the cost of reproduction is increasing day by day. With the sudden rise in financial commodities, sellers are holding on even more fiercely, and the asking price is changing frequently. The market is becoming more prosperous, and prices are shining brightly. Domestic tea is being sought after in this street and other places, and transactions are continuing. As for export container tea, the shipping schedule is still far away, so buying is limited, and not much business is being done.

### Tung Oil Soars

The tung oil market opened in the morning due to the exuberance of the people, and the trend was upward. Later, it was further stimulated by the soaring prices of various commodities. In addition, sufficient tung oil was being used for restocking by foreign firms, and the buying interest of paint shops on this street for refined tung oil was also strong. Sellers raised prices one after another, and the market moved rapidly all the way. As a result of the market closing, prices rose by 400 to 500 yuan compared to the previous market.

### Silk and Satin Soar

Yesterday, the silk market rose again. People in the industry are already crazy. All commodities in other sectors are rising together, and everyone is buying. Retail investors all have a bullish mentality, so the market price is rising without end.

The opening price of No. 120 Tianqiao was 32,000 yuan. The Taiban gang quickly raised prices, and the silk weaving industry tried its best to absorb the supply. Inventories quickly became scarce, and demand was still strong. The asking price rose step by step, and the high price once reached 34,500 yuan. Later, due to the excessive rise in prices in recent days, bulls were afraid of a backlash, so the intention to sell became stronger, and the buying interest in the market also flattened. The market returned to a small 500 yuan, a strong increase of 5,000 yuan. Dongyang Jin and Sanma each rose by about 5,000 yuan.

The spot price of raw silk rose sharply due to the increase in foreign exchange transfer certificates. People's minds are filled with the idea of catching the peak. However, because the market price is too high, the industry is quite wary, and foreign firms are also buying less. The market price softened after rising, but the closing price still showed an increase. D-grade 78 uniformity white factory silk was priced at 33,500 yuan. The buying interest in the middle was not strong, and the asking price showed a slight decrease. Retail investors' thoughts were particularly soft, and there were frequent sales in the market. Later, cotton yarn rose sharply, and foreign exchange rose again. People's minds became agitated again, and the asking price tended to rise again. Near noon, the high price was 36,500 yuan at the close, up 7,000 yuan. In the afternoon, people continued to be bullish, and the asking price was 300 to 500 yuan higher, but transactions were scarce.

Due to raw silk weaving, the market conditions for silk satin cannot be stabilized. Speculators outside the industry have also begun to hoard and buy, and everyone is bullish. Meiya was opened in the morning at 19,500 yuan. It was heard that commodity prices in other sectors had jumped sharply, and people were greatly stimulated. The market was filled with excited buying, and the asking price went straight up, reaching a high of 21,500 yuan. After the high, the market turned flat because of weak actual sales and unstable foundations. As a result, the closing price was 21,000 yuan, up another 4,000 yuan. Huaqiang closed at 20,500 yuan, up only 3,000 yuan. The common rest rose by 30% to 50%.

### Strong Buying Interest and Firm Holding by Dealers Lead to New Highs in Cotton Yarn Prices; Lively and Comprehensive Surge in the Fabric Market

The upward trend in cotton yarn shows no sign of stopping. Spot transactions are active, and dealers are reluctant to sell. Prices of all yarns are rising across the board.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 34,000 yuan, briefly fell to 33,500 yuan, then surged to close at a high of 39,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 7,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix last traded at 35,300 yuan, a dramatic rise of 7,300 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at 28,000 yuan and eventually reached the 30,000 yuan mark, jumping by 4,300 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot goods fell slightly from 25,000 yuan to a low of 23,300 yuan. Near noon, prices suddenly surged to 27,400 yuan, ending up 4,400 yuan higher. Factory orders were 4,300 yuan higher, and one-day arbitrage was 500 yuan. 20-count Golden Rooster rose by 5,600 yuan, closing at 24,500 yuan. 26-count Brightness held steady at a high of 20,000 yuan. Other yarns, such as 10-count yarn, also hit unprecedented new highs.

The fabric market also repeatedly saw new highs, and the rising trend continued to be strong. Local buyers were very active, and sellers firmly held onto their goods. Prices of all fabrics surged across the board.

Grade 1 Fine Cloth initially opened at 840 yuan. It briefly dropped to 830 yuan, but then buying interest suddenly intensified, and the price rose to 870 yuan. The afternoon close was 865 yuan, resulting in a significant increase of 120 yuan.

Mid-range Fine Cloth also saw lively trading, with market prices consistently above 800 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" Plain Serge closed at 840 yuan, a sharp increase of 130 yuan. "Golden Lotus Dancing" Plain Serge and "Leifeng Pagoda" Plain Serge also aggressively advanced to new highs. "Four Gentlemen" Plain Drill surged by 125 yuan. Other fabrics such as Shilin Cloth and printed fabrics all jumped by 10% to 20%. In the afternoon, off-market bidding continued to escalate. It was reported that Grade 1 Fine Cloth was approaching the 1,000 yuan mark, reaching 950 yuan.

### Deadline Approaching for Increased Capital of Trading Firms; National Banks Handling Capital Verification Procedures

[Our Dispatch] The deadline for transferring the increased capital portions of commercial trading firms in this city is rapidly approaching. In order to understand the actual use of the increased capital funds, the Central Bank recently sent personnel to various trading firms to handle capital verification procedures, which are expected to be completed within a day or two. At that time, the transfer deadline will also arrive, and the various trading firms can formally apply for the transfer. Furthermore, according to sources from the Bankers Association: The Silver Money and Trust Industries Association is notifying members to expedite the capital increase procedures, hoping to submit them to the Central Bank within the deadline. The cash transfer portion, however, is still under consideration due to usage issues. The Ministry of Finance has not yet clearly indicated its stance, so the trading firms are not yet prepared to transfer it. It is reported that the Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter stating that the Ministry of Finance will not freeze the cash, and the Silver Money and Trust Industries Association has also sent a letter requesting the Ministry of Finance to change the usage methods, but the Ministry of Finance has not yet responded. The association believes that the current financial strength of the silver money industry is weak. If the funds are frozen according to the Ministry of Finance's regulations, capital will not be able to circulate. Therefore, the issue of cash usage is of great concern to the relevant trading firms, and they will vigorously fight for their interests. Thus, before the usage methods are agreed upon, the capital increase procedures can be completed within the deadline, but the transfer of the cash portion will be considered later.

### Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates Surpass the 100 Yuan Mark

### 28th Application Begins "Reader Relief Fund" Calls for Donations

The "Reader Relief Fund" sponsored by this newspaper, has approved the seventh group of eight people and disbursed the funds. The 28th application period begins now and will end on December 31st. Those found to be genuinely in need will receive appropriate assistance. This relief fund is specifically for fellow citizens suffering from orphaning, widowhood, poverty, illness, old age, weakness, disability and hardship. The application procedure requires submitting one application form detailing the circumstances of distress, certified by the local Bao or Jia leader, and securing a shop guarantee. Mail the application with its batch number to the Social Service Department of this newspaper for review. In recent months, due to rising prices, the need for relief funds has also increased sharply, causing the original fund to be rapidly depleted. It is hoped that enthusiastic readers from all walks of life will generously donate to enable these suffering fellow citizens to receive timely assistance, rekindling their courage to survive, which would be greatly appreciated.

### Reader Mailbox

[Answer to Mr. Xu Hao of Jiangdu] The Civil Code stipulates: "Marriage contracts should be entered into by the man and woman themselves." Also, "Men under the age of seventeen and women under the age of fifteen may not enter into marriage contracts." When your younger sister was four years old, your mother made the decision to arrange a marriage for her with Mr. Wang. This marriage contract is fundamentally invalid under the law. Now that she is an adult, she can declare it dissolved. After the dissolution procedures are completed, she can then enter into a marriage contract with another man. Mr. Wang has no right to interfere.

[Answer to Mr. Yu Gongfu of Shanghai] Hosting banquets for weddings and other celebrations in non-public venues does not require paying banquet tax. However, if hosted in public venues, even if temporary workers are hired to handle the arrangements or materials are purchased and prepared independently, the taxpayer must first conduct an evaluation by the local tax authorities to estimate the tax amount and report and pay taxes in advance.

### Postal Matters

To Mr. Yu Chou Shi of Hangzhou: Your submitted proposal has already been forwarded to the relevant authorities. It seems unnecessary to publish it again. Due to space constraints, our newspaper regrets that we cannot reprint it. We have two manuscript drafts. Please provide a mailing address for their return.

Recruitment of Personnel: The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Office of the China Vocational Education Society has recently been commissioned by a certain farm in Zhejiang to seek two female teaching staff. Qualified candidates should be graduates of normal schools, proficient in arithmetic, physical education, art, and writing, and be in their thirties with no family burden. Those who wish to apply should go to No. 80 Yandang Road to discuss in person.
