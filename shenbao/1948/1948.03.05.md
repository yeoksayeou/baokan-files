### MacArthur States Opinion on Aiding China: Military Problems Should Be Resolved First; China's Freedom is Related to World Peace

[United States News Service, Washington, 3rd] General MacArthur declined the invitation from Congress to return to the US to testify on the China Aid Bill, but sent a telegram to the House of Representatives outlining his views, expressing support for aid to China.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] General MacArthur telegraphed House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton today, stating, "A free, independent, peaceful, and friendly China is of utmost importance to world peace. The fundamental problem in China today is the military one, which must be resolved before internal recovery can be expected to progress." It is reported that this is MacArthur's first statement on the China issue since commanding the Allied Headquarters. This telegram, sent by MacArthur from Tokyo, is a formal response to the Foreign Affairs Committee's request for him to express his views on the China Aid plan. He emphasized that the international aspect of the China issue has been obscured by demands for internal reforms, while internal reforms are only secondary to the issue of China's civil war. MacArthur declared: "To underestimate China's needs or importance would be a great mistake. If we are to pursue a universal policy of defending the frontiers of freedom and deterring the attacks of political despots, then the importance of each frontier is equal" (The full text of MacArthur's telegram to Eaton is on the left-hand side).

### House to Draft Separate China Aid Plan: European Recovery Plan as Blueprint for China Aid; Marshall Says Has Discussed with Our Authorities

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] It is learned that a House China Aid Bill is currently being drafted and may be formally introduced next week. The bill will be formulated based on the economic aid plan listed by US judge and China expert, Alerman, to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, which advocates economic assistance of more than 900 million US dollars, plus an unspecified amount of military aid.

[Another Dispatch] Republican Congressman Vorys stated: Military aid will be included in the proposed China Aid Bill.

[Another Dispatch] Marshall, in answering questions before the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, stated that the US has discussed with the Chinese government the issue of using the European Recovery Plan as a blueprint for the China Aid plan. He also said: "We have discussed the above issue with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Chinese Ambassador to the US Gu Weijun, and the Chinese technical delegation currently in the US. At the same time, Democratic congressmen on the House Foreign Affairs Committee who support the government's stance on military aid to China and oppose combining foreign economic and military aid bills into 'one package' have submitted a list of speakers to express their views on the China Aid plan, including former Ambassador to China Gauss, recently retired head of the US Military Advisory Group to China Lucas, former UNRRA Director Lucas, former UNRRA China Office Director Egerton, former US Naval Attaché to the US Embassy in China McHugh, and Federal Reserve Board economic expert Tamagna, among others, but the date for seeking the opinions of the above individuals has not been specified.

### Wedemeyer's Testimony on Aiding China: If Military Aid is Not Given to Prevent Communist Expansion, US Will Have to Pay with Blood

[This Newspaper Report] New York, 4th, broadcast, Washington dispatch, former US military commander in China, General Wedemeyer, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 4th, claiming that if steps are not taken quickly to curb the expansion of communism, the United States will have to "pay with blood." If the United States wants to prevent the "widespread actions" of communism, it must provide military aid to other countries in addition to economic aid. Wedemeyer stated: He has always admired General Marshall, but his views on military aid are indeed very different. He does not believe that economic aid alone can stop communism in any part of the world. He believes that under the current circumstances, the United States does not need to directly participate militarily in China's anti-communist struggle, but should provide military aid to the Chinese National Government. He said: Two years ago, giving China 200 million US dollars in economic aid alone would have been effective, but given that the strength of the Communist Party has increased since then, he believes that even if 570 million US dollars in economic aid is given now, it is not enough, and it must be supplemented by military aid to be effective.

[This Newspaper Report] General Chennault has been invited by the US House Foreign Affairs Committee and will fly to the US in the next few days, arriving in Washington before March 10 to testify on the China Aid Bill. According to Chennault, he is rushing to draft a written opinion, and his views on the China Aid Bill will focus on military and economic aid, with military aid being the prerequisite.

Already Expressed in China Aid Stance

MacArthur today was unwilling to exaggerate his response to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton. Chinese sources here praised MacArthur's statement as "the first world statesman to give the clearest analysis of the main problems faced by the Chinese people to date."

### US Official McCaby Wastes Surplus Materials

Republican Congressman Reveals Inside Story

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] When the Senate Banking Committee examined the qualifications of former Overseas Surplus Assets Administrator McCaby to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board today, Republican Senator Du倍 issued a statement of ten thousand words, accusing McCaby of improper measures in the sale of surplus assets to China. It is claimed that McCaby's agent in China, Johnson, had agreed to sell eleven B-25 bombers, which were almost brand new, to a certain company opened by Soong Tzu-liang. When the news of this transaction was published in the newspapers, McCaby overstepped his authority and ordered the tails of the sold aircraft to be cut off. McCaby admitted that his role was to avoid unfavorable publicity at home. Another new B-25 aircraft, worth 243,000 yuan, was not included in the surplus assets and was similarly handled by McCaby's subordinates.

The delegation's visit to Beijing this time indicates that the people of the Northeast are making every effort to support the Central Government and are willing to cooperate with the Central Government. The reason for putting forward these suggestions is to seek cooperation with the government. B. Regarding the establishment of local armed forces, this is the unanimous opinion of the representatives of the Northeast. It is reported that the representatives who came to Beijing this time include elderly, middle-aged, and young people, and their opinions are unified.

### Situation in Northeast is Becoming Brighter: No Trace of Bandits Within 100 Li of Shenyang; National Army in Siping Has Also Completed New Deployment

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] Except for small groups of bandit troops in the South Shahe and Liaoyang areas of Shenyang Border Force, there are no traces of bandits within 100 li in the west, east, and north. People's hearts are stable, and prices are also tired. The farmers in Chengxian Township eagerly hope to rectify discipline so that they can prepare for spring plowing. Only Zhou Jing in Shenxi Xinmin Da'an has small groups of bandits scurrying around. The number of bandits in southern and western Liaoning has also been greatly reduced, and most of the bandits have been transferred across the Liao River. In addition to the fact that the bandits' major attack on Siping has become more concrete, there are two other possibilities for the large-scale northward transfer of bandits: one is to attack Jilin Changchun, and the other is to gather for reorganization and replenishment. Because the bandit troops are exhausted, and casualties are heavy, they need to be reorganized and replenished. After days of deployment, the bandits around Siping seem to have been completed, and the war is about to break out. The bandits have not dared to attack the important industrial and mining area of ​​Benxi in southeast Shenyang.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] Xinmin is still tight. On the 3rd, the surrounding communist bandits used field artillery to cover and fought fiercely with the National Army in the suburbs of the northwest two cities. At dawn on the 4th, the communist bandits continued to advance from the northern suburbs to the city suburbs, and the garrison calmly fought back. Heishan and the five-hua-li area in the suburbs have been completely controlled by the National Army on the 3rd. Another route of the National Army continued to advance after conquering Tangjiawo

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] In recent days, the communist bandits in Liaobei have been frequently mobilizing and continue to gather near Siping. The bandit troops in Kaiyuan Changtu are currently gathering towards the Lianhuajie Yehe Station (southeast of Siping), and the bandit troops who fled from the north bank of the Liao River to near Faku continued to move towards Tongjiangkou on the evening of the 2nd. The National Army has completed its deployment in response to the bandit's situation

[Reuters, Nanjing, 4th] The general military situation in the Northeast looks brighter than it has been in many weeks. Fan Hanjie's corps' aircraft-borne troops are advancing along the Beining Line and continue to make progress.

### National Army in Eastern Henan Makes a Quick Victory: Recaptures Qi County, Yongcheng, and Sui County; Anti-Bandit Operations in Southern Henan Advance into Xi County

[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 4th] A strong force of the National Army in eastern Henan recovered Qi County and Yongcheng on the 3rd and recaptured Sui County, and the remaining bandits fled south.

Chen's troops have recently withdrawn to Huaiyang, and Boxian has become a ruin, and no troops have moved in. Taihe Xijieshou has been recovered, and Wei Fenlou's bandits have fled north.

[Central News Agency, Xinyang, 4th] The powerful National Army, in coordination with local teams, launched an anti-bandit operation against the 2nd Column of bandits and local communists Zhang Guohua and Wei Fenlou on the north bank of the Huai River. On the 2nd, two routes crossed the Huai River north and moved into Wulongji, Xi County. The bandits fled north at the sound of the wind, and there are currently no traces of bandits in Xi County.

[This Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 4th] Chen Geng's bandits in Baofeng and Linru dare not act rashly, given the strict defenses of the National Army in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway.

[This Newspaper, Luoyang, 3rd] According to a telegram from Liu Guanghua, the head of Yichuan County, about 1,500 bandits led by Kong Congzhou in Diaojie, Linru, carrying six artillery pieces and many machine guns, fled in two groups, one westward towards Zhaizijie and the other northward towards Yangzhai, Yangling, and Baisha.

### Full Text of MacArthur's Telegram to Eaton

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The full text of MacArthur's telegram to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton is as follows:

"I am deeply grateful for the trust that the House Foreign Affairs Committee has placed in me by inviting me to return home to state my opinions on the China Aid policy.

The handling of Japanese administration is extremely complicated, especially with the recent change of government in Japan, which makes it impossible for me to leave my post even for a moment. Even if this were not the case, I would be very doubtful whether I could provide useful and constructive opinions on the details of the China Aid proposals, since I have not seen or had the opportunity to study these details to date.

As you may know, China is within the operational scope of the US Navy and beyond my current authority. I have no representative stationed in China, and most of the detailed information I know, apart from general history, is obtained indirectly.

US officials have carefully studied the Chinese situation, but this study is not within my authority and source of information, so I am not very familiar with it. Moreover, I have had no opportunity to visit China for many years. The determination of a definite policy for this particular region naturally depends on countless detailed details, but given my situation, you will understand that I am unable to provide authoritative advice on the above details.

Although the questions you have raised are divided into many sections, I can only answer them in general terms. I can resolutely say that an independent, free, and friendly China is of great importance to world peace and the position of the United States.

This is the cornerstone of the Pacific arch.

The root of the Chinese problem is only a military problem. Unless the military problem can be resolved, even with foreign aid, the domestic recovery is difficult to hope for. Once this problem is resolved, China's traditional recovery performance can undoubtedly become the basis for a rapid return to relative stability.

The orientation of American policy should consider the world situation as a whole, and the Chinese problem is only a part of it.

If piecemeal decisions are made in unrelated areas of the world, the overall problem will still not be solved. From the US standpoint, this problem is a global problem and can only be solved on the broadest global basis. We would be greatly mistaken if we underestimate China's needs or its importance. If we pursue a general policy of strengthening the frontiers of freedom to prevent the invasion of autocratic politics, then every major frontier is of equal importance. If we make a serious mistake in one aspect, all our efforts will be destroyed.

East and West are Equally Important, Asia Should Not Be Ignored

The Fate of the American Posterity is Tied to the Pacific

Due to deep-rooted racial, cultural, and commercial ties, we are easily overly focused on matters east of the United States and ignore the importance of areas west of us. The past history of the United States is deeply rooted on the other side of the Atlantic, but if the American posterity wants to keep pace with the progress of the former times, their hope is also built on the situation on the other side of the Pacific.

When we fully utilize the origins east of the United States, we should, on the one hand, obtain unprecedented trade and commercial opportunities by turbidizing the progress of Asian nations to seek hope for improving life for the western horizon; on the other hand, we should also pay attention to the threats that harm our lives.

Beyond the horizon, opposing forces are engaged in ideological struggles, war or peace, guarantee or threat, hope or fear, all depend on the outcome of the struggle and whether the balance of political, economic, and social factors can be restored.

Demanding Internal Political Reform Is Not the Time

How Can We Change the Beams When the House Is on Fire

The international aspect of the Chinese problem is unfortunately obscured by demands for internal political reform. Although reform is necessary, its importance is still secondary to the internal struggle that shrouds the entire China, and these two problems cannot be coordinated, just like a house is on fire, and others are still fussing about reforming its beams.

We have a very friendly interest in the reform of Chinese politics and hope that China can approach our ideals of freedom and fairness. It is even more important to maintain China's independence and resist the destructive forces that seek to submerge China. The reason is that when sovereignty can stand firm, reforms can naturally be carried out in an evolutionary way in the future.

Military Surplus Materials Should Be Fairly Allocated to China

Do Not Underestimate China's Strategic Importance

The shipment of military surplus materials beyond what we need to China has been restored. We should also measure more aid materials to China based on the fair proportion of global assistance determined by the direction of US policy. When the US policy is oriented, we should not underestimate the strategic importance of a free and peaceful China to us and the world, we should not ignore the poverty and fatigue caused by China's years of war, we should not mistake its potential for stability and the development of our future living standards, nor should we ignore the long-term friendly relations between the two countries that have been credible and strong in years of peace and war.

When deciding on our world policy, we should be careful not to exhaust our resources on obligations that we cannot undertake, so as to reduce our national strength and endanger our own security, so as not to burden our people and make no one maintain the living standards they deserve.

It is illogical for us to give up our own freedom to protect the freedom of others; it is also illogical for us to give material aid to others without hope of obtaining a contribution from the other party to the progress of mankind in return; it is also illogical for us to sacrifice ourselves and cause poverty and exhaustion elsewhere, and hinder the progress of mankind, then what is the point of our purpose?

The American people have always stood up in times of crisis and competed to be the first to accept the challenges of the times. This is the traditional characteristic of the American people.

The world is in chaos, and there has never been a greater need than today for us to accept great fearlessness and active leadership as a stabilizing force. The American people are also more willing than ever to sacrifice themselves and help others if they recognize this as a meaningful sacrifice.

We live on the land of the United States, making the world understand a way of life, even if it is obscured by chaos, unrest, and selfish desires, this way of life is still the hope and goal that all mankind yearns for.

Let us strive to maintain this way of life.

### Legislative Yuan Finance Committee Discusses Currency Reform Plan: Decides to Draft Recommendations to Submit to the Yuan Meeting

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The Legislative Yuan Finance Committee held a subcommittee meeting on the morning of the 4th to discuss the currency reform plan proposed by Zhang Zhaoyuan. Jian Guansan presided over the meeting, and Dai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Wu Dazhong, Director of the Economic Research Office of the Central Bank, were present. First, Zhang reported on his plan, saying that when he was in the United States, he had discussed the possibility of restoring silver coins in China with people in the industrial and commercial circles and many congressmen, who all believed that the stability of prices in China would be of great benefit to promoting foreign trade, and that currency reform could restore the people's confidence in the value of currency, which would help to stabilize prices. He estimated that a total of 1 billion ounces of silver would be needed to cast 2 billion silver coins weighing five mace each, and maintain a certain exchange rate with foreign exchange. The current legal currency would continue to exist and be freely exchanged for silver coins at an appropriate ratio. Once the value of currency and prices are stable, paper money can be issued for circulation, and the depreciated legal currency can be gradually eliminated. Then, Director Dai stated from an official standpoint that silver coins can be used as supplementary coins, but should not be used as the main currency. The purpose of currency reform is to prevent the value of currency from falling again, but if prices cannot be stabilized, the effect of the reform is difficult to expect, so the timing of the reform does not seem to have arrived. Then, the committee members expressed their opinions, and most believed that there were many difficulties in issuing silver coins. Borrowing silver would be difficult, and the people's hoarding of silver and the Communist bandits' seizure of silver would all affect the effect of reissuing silver coins. Finally, it was decided that Zhang would organize and review the opinions and his plan and make a recommendation, and then submit it to the Yuan meeting for discussion.

At the same time, a "General Command" was established in Hejian, with Nie Rongzhen as the commander-in-chief. The main reason for the bandits to establish this organization is to try to coordinate with the Northeast war and to resist the establishment of the Northeast North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] The communist bandits Nie Rongzhen's troops once again moved out to harass the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, attempting to contain the North China National Army and support the Northeast.

### Transferring State-Owned Enterprises; Organizing an Underwriting Syndicate

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] The principle of transferring state-owned enterprises to private management through the issuance of stocks has been approved at a previous meeting of the National Economic Council. Based on the principles decided by the National Economic Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently drafted the "Measures for the Underwriting Syndicate to Raise Funds for the Transfer of State-Owned Enterprises Through Stock Issuance." Key points of the measures are noted below:

(1) The government will designate national banks and bureaus to jointly organize a "Syndicate for Raising Funds for the Transfer of State-Owned Enterprises to Private Management." It will designate one bank as the convening bank. Its tasks will be to formulate the organization of new companies for each unit of the enterprises to be transferred according to government regulations, handle the issuance of new company stocks, collect the proceeds, and transfer funds.

(2) The syndicate will be located in Shanghai, with branch offices established in various locations where state-owned enterprises are being sold.

(3) The government should divide the enterprises into units based on the characteristics, scale, location, and other relevant conditions of each enterprise and designate a minimum price for each unit, with the principle that each unit can independently establish a new company.

(4) The syndicate should be responsible for assessing the actual value of each unit of the enterprise, determine the amount of new company capital based on the government's transfer price, and conduct public fundraising.

(5) After the syndicate has raised sufficient funds for each unit of the enterprise, it should promptly collect all payments, remit them to the national treasury, and convene the shareholders of the new company to establish the new company, generate the new company's responsible persons, and take over the enterprise from the government. However, to accelerate the transfer of state-owned enterprises, it may collect the already raised funds, establish the new company, and take over the enterprise from the government after more than half of the funds have been raised. The unraised amount will be temporarily considered a government investment. The government may entrust the syndicate to continue selling the unraised shares, and the price may be increased by the government at any time and remitted to the national treasury. It is also understood that after the implementation of these measures, the following goals can be achieved: (1) Truly absorb idle capital and tighten currency. (2) The people have investment opportunities. (3) The organization and management of the enterprises after the transfer will be sound and suitable for future development. (4) Comply with the principles of fairness and openness.

Editorial

### MacArthur's Brilliant Insight on Aid to China

We are familiar with the calls for American aid to China. We thank our friendly nation, both the government and the public, for their concern about the China issue. We are especially impressed with General MacArthur's recent telegram to the U.S. Congress, in which he stated that military assistance should be the priority in aiding China. Military experts who have been stationed in the Far East for a long time truly have brilliant insights and foresight!

Since President Truman submitted the $570 million aid-to-China plan to the U.S. Congress, committees in both houses of Congress and the public have mostly believed that the amount is too small and have expressed dissatisfaction that the government did not include military assistance. Even Secretary of State Marshall himself admitted that financial assistance alone is not enough to save the Chinese government from its precarious situation. The two houses of Congress have been actively discussing the issue of aid to China recently, and have already touched upon the actual core of the problem. Ambassador to the U.S. William Bullitt testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 2nd, making an urgent appeal on the issue of aid to China. He strongly advocated for military aid to China and forcefully argued for the crisis the United States faces in the Far East. Although Mr. Bullitt's words are enough to correct the U.S. government and public's perspective on the China issue, he has been calling for their countrymen to increase their awareness of the Far East crisis since he returned to the U.S. from China, so his speech on the 2nd may be seen as old news by the American people. Chairman Eaton of the House Foreign Affairs Committee telegraphed MacArthur in Tokyo and General Chennault, the Flying Tiger General in China, requesting them to return to the country to testify, report on the actual situation in the Far East, and express their opinions on the issue of aid to China. The Flying Tiger General will soon return to the U.S. to testify, and we believe he will definitely expose the truth of the Communist rebellion, but we will put that aside for now and first discuss MacArthur's memorandum.

Although MacArthur has politely declined the invitation from Congress to return to the U.S. to testify, he has sent a memorandum to Washington stating his opinions on aid to China. The main points are as follows: (1) The main problem in China is military, and the military issue must be resolved first, and then economic recovery and other reforms can be discussed, so he strongly advocates military aid to China. (2) China is the basic pillar of the Pacific arch, and a free, independent, peaceful, and friendly China is extremely important for world peace and the U.S. position. (3) He warned Congress not to focus too much on European affairs due to close ethnic, cultural, and business relations. (4) It is a mistake to underestimate China's needs and its importance. (5) The United States should not only pay attention to China's reforms, but also be concerned about China's integrity to prevent destructive forces from plunging it into the abyss. (6) The Chinese government currently needs military assistance the most. (7) The China issue is part of a global issue and should be viewed from a global perspective.

From these opinions, it can be seen that MacArthur has never neglected China's importance in Asia, and his views are exactly what we want to say. What is especially rare is that he can bluntly point out: "Before the Communists are defeated, wanting China to complete internal reforms is like trying to change the architectural plans of a house that is being burned down." These are truly insightful and to-the-point words. His understanding of China to this extent is beyond the expectations of most people. There have been various speculations about MacArthur from the outside world. Some say that MacArthur wants to support Japan to oppose the Soviet Union, while others say that MacArthur does not value China's position in the Far East at all, but after his serious expression this time, not only can it dispel ordinary people's misunderstandings, but it can also clarify the current public opinion and allow us to gain several basic understandings.

First, whether it is the Democratic Party or the Republican Party in the U.S. government and the public, no one does not advocate actively carrying out aid to China. In addition to financial assistance, military assistance must be emphasized. If we conduct an objective study, there are probably two reasons why U.S. public opinion has been able to reach this further understanding: on the one hand, it is because of the deterioration of the situation in China, and politics, economics, and military affairs are originally mutually causal. Financial assistance alone, which can only alleviate China's breathing, is not enough to save China from its crisis. On the other hand, the U.S. government and public have a more accurate understanding of the situation in the Far East and are no longer deceived by the Communist Party's false propaganda. Not to mention the far-sighted diplomats, political commentators, and members of the two houses of Congress, who have unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the government's failure to include military assistance in the aid-to-China plan, even Secretary of State Marshall, who is in charge of the aid-to-China plan, also admits that this mere $570 million in aid is useless. Now, MacArthur's opinion is being sought, and MacArthur also believes that military aid to China is necessary. From this, we believe that the U.S. government and the public will more actively advocate for military assistance to China in addition to economic assistance. The United States is a democratic country, and all domestic and foreign policies must accept the opinions of the majority of the people. Although President Truman's aid-to-China plan is limited to $570 million and does not include military assistance, judging from the current trend, the two houses of Congress may revise it. The implementation of the military aid-to-China plan is very hopeful.

Second, in the past six months, people have often expressed doubts about the U.S.'s actions in recent years and MacArthur's words and deeds in Tokyo, believing that the U.S. intends to neglect China and support Japan. The occurrence of this kind of doubt cannot be said to be due to the U.S. government's not clear enough attitude towards Japan. The consequence of this policy of supporting Japan is that China is the first to be directly affected by its adverse effects. In the face of threats, people in our country, both the government and the public, inevitably have fears about the U.S.'s policy towards Japan. Now, after reading MacArthur's reply, we can see that MacArthur deeply understands the importance of China's position. China is not only an important base point in Asia and is extremely important to world peace, but the changes in China's political situation and the arrogance of the Communist forces are enough to affect Japan, the Philippines, Siam, India, and even the U.S.'s position in the Far East and the Pacific will be completely changed. When Marshal Marshall debated the issue of aid to China in Congress, he said: The deterioration of the situation in Northeast China is enough to affect the U.S.'s position in Japan and Korea. Now MacArthur also specially emphasizes the importance of China to world peace and the U.S.'s position, which shows that great minds think alike. From this, the doubts of the outside world can be dispelled, and how China and the U.S. will coordinate actions in the future to jointly maintain world peace will begin with the U.S.'s implementation of military aid to China.

Third, until now, there are still some people in the U.S. who have been blinded by the Communist Party and its surrounding deceptive propaganda, and they do not clearly understand the "Chinese Communists." They have always believed that the "Chinese Communists" are an ordinary political party and do not believe that they are a bandit party that colludes with foreign races and conspires to seize power by violence. But after reading MacArthur's reply, they will definitely suddenly realize. The "Chinese Communists" not only completely obey Moscow, but the "Chinese Communists'" military disturbances are precisely a part of the "world violent revolution" instigated by totalitarian countries. If the "Chinese Communists" succeed and also organize a communist regime in China, then China will become an appendage of the totalitarian country. How can there be any democracy or freedom? The recent coup in Czechoslovakia is an excellent example! At the beginning of the victory, the "Chinese Communists" also sang the slogan of a "united government," and the atmosphere of political consultation also seemed extremely fashionable, but it is not known that even if it succeeded at that time, it would be difficult to guarantee that the "Chinese Communists" would not launch another "coup." Therefore, compromise with the "Chinese Communists" has proved that this path does not work. Today, American friends can have this understanding, which is of great benefit to understanding the China issue: it is also equivalent to preparing to inject a vaccine to prevent war in the Far East.

In short, for the sake of Sino-American cooperation, for the sake of peace in the Far East, and for the sake of the future of democracy and freedom, we sincerely welcome the brilliant insights of MacArthur and other visionaries on military aid to China!

### China Society for Social and Economic Research Denies Being a Political Organization; Song Ziwen Has Not Donated Funds

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 4th dispatch] After the China Society for Social and Economic Research, initiated by Qian Changzhao, Zhou Binglin, Wu Jingchao, and others, was established in Beiping, its movements have attracted attention from all parties. Especially since the society was established after Ambassador Stuart released his letter to the Chinese people, there were rumors that the society was brewing a "new third party" and launching a "movement for the great unity of intellectuals." Wu Jingchao, the spokesperson of the society, denied the above speculations in an interview with reporters on the 3rd, stating that the society is not a political organization, but also admitting that the society hopes to have political influence. A reporter asked: Will the society suggest its research results on politics, diplomacy, and economics to the government? Wu replied: "We are not preparing to submit a letter to anyone.

Ode to Mahatma Gandhi Made Respectfully by Dai Shixian

First Chapter: Great Saint, Four Verses of Four Sentences

Respect the planting of all compassion in the world. I pre-create and praise its truthfulness and infallibility. A saint is born in troubled times. The saint's intention is to save the world. If one asks why there is chaos, it is all caused by human laziness. Human nature is not inherently evil, but evil is caused by habit. Remove the impurities and restore purity. The saint is forbearing and does not retaliate, returning with an equal outlook. The saint, with a compassionate heart, sacrifices himself to save people in the world.

He died but his teachings shined in all directions, and all people returned to reverence. In the East, there is a saint called Confucius, who was cut off between Chen and Cai but continued to practice the Way until his death. Although he suffered hardship, his great Way moved people's hearts. His supreme virtue extended to all generations, and the whole world returned to benevolence. King Wen endured great hardship and returned to his beautiful home after seven years. His saintly influence spread throughout the world, and the Zhou Dynasty rose from the mountains.

They turn back to greed and anger, and turning back to anger, they desire enjoyment. They harm themselves and others, and people and I are both disadvantaged. There are also those who are foolish and who follow evil with joy, wrongly recognizing evil as good. It is pitiful, like this is foolish and always wants to obstruct the saintly path. The saintly path is equal to heaven and earth and ultimately cannot be obstructed. These foolish people妄扭機as pure and devote themselves to the burning house.仇火丑白weak people become鼠竊and strong people become盜賊. Small ones are都人物and big ones become成人國.

Fifth Chapter: Stealing Fire and Sage Wisdom, Six Verses of Four Sentences

Sages are not born into the world, they are born to save the world. Their saintly virtue touches people's hearts and returns chaos to order. I often advise that the teachings of Yi are difficult, and the sages are difficult to compare. Practicing with repeated dangers and repeated brightness will then follow it. The virtue of the Jiu hexagram is constant. One practices by teaching and learning. The affairs are gentle on the outside and strong on the inside, based on righteousness and not on profit. The virtue of the Chongming hexagram is to inherit brightness and illuminate all directions. It is strong on the outside and soft on the inside, so it can express great meaning. Sages transform the world, and their ambition is to make civilization known. First, they suffer and work hard,走為習坎行.

Seventh Chapter: Saint's Certainty and Sincere Teaching, Nine Verses of Four Sentences

The most important thing to save people is to return without greed. Loving people and living frugally are easy to know but difficult to do. Greed is the囤of anger. Killing is the first.

### Belgian Prime Minister Presides Over Opening Ceremony, Five Countries Confer on Western European Alliance, Continues with Secret Meeting to Discuss Anglo-French Draft

[Reuters Brussels 4th Dispatch] The conference of five countries, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, to discuss the Western European alliance opened today at the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, presided over in person by the Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak. The flags of the five countries were also inserted on the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Spaak delivered a short opening speech in the external conference room, saying:

"We are meeting here today at a time when European freedom is nearing its end, to find a way to bridge the natural divisions between our countries and organize a political and economic group. It is self-evident that we are forced to take this action by the squeeze of communist forces. Communism has already destroyed the once proud countries of Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, and is now approaching Finland. When British Foreign Secretary Bevin put forward the proposal to unite the resources of Western European countries and their territories, very few people believed that this plan could be completed in our generation. However, now, only forty days after the proposal was put forward, we know that Mr. Bevin's plan is not an empty talk. Today, we have no choice but to accept his proposal, because his proposal is no longer just an empty proposal. We must unite, abandon prejudices, and build our resources to be a great bulwark of freedom-loving countries, strengthening our strength to deal with the East. You are starting the work of the Western European Alliance plan today, and you will start studying a draft treaty. This treaty, politically and economically, and also necessarily militarily, will unite our five European countries and overseas African territories. Our common future may stem from this. You are all aware of the urgency of the situation, and I will not say much more, but I ask you to start work, because time is very urgent and there is not much left."

After Spaak presided over the opening ceremony, he withdrew from the venue. Representatives and experts from the five countries then began a secret meeting. The British and French delegations have brought a draft of the five-country treaty, the main points of which include: (1) The Western European Alliance should include Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Italy. The Iberian Peninsula countries and Scandinavian countries will be invited to consider joining. (2) Any treaty to which Western European countries will participate should include accepting mutual assistance, even going to war, to assist any ally of the alliance that is attacked by a country outside the alliance in violation of the United Nations Charter, on the principle of mutual assistance. (3) The allied countries should exchange military groups, defense plans, weapons, and equipment. (4) In terms of economy, efforts should be made to reduce tariff barriers immediately in accordance with the International Trade Charter and the provisions of the Havana Conference. The British and French draft also stipulates ways to develop European resources to provide a source of supply for "free Europe." American personnel in Belgium believe that the draft five-country alliance will definitely be produced after the meeting. Although Britain did not participate in the meeting, it will be notified of the progress of the meeting at any time, as will the British Commonwealth countries.

### Three Powers Discuss the West German Question, Meeting May End Today, Compensation Issues and the Merger of the Three Zones Have Been Discussed

[Reuters London 3rd Dispatch] The West German question, which is closely related to the future of the Western European Alliance plan, is expected to be answered before the end of Friday's London Three Powers Conference. (1) After Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg report the results of this meeting to their respective governments, will they stipulate a date for the continuation of the German question talks? (2) The small group tasked with studying important issues such as the Ruhr International Regime will submit a report before the end of this plenary session, or will it continue to discuss after the end of this plenary session.

Spokespersons for the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg raised this question at the meeting yesterday, and the British representative, Stroumbold, who chaired the meeting, has guaranteed that he will answer later. If this meeting is successful, certain permanent institutions should be established to prepare the six participating countries to exchange views on permanent issues. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg did not participate in the second half of yesterday's meeting, and the agenda was the compensation issue, meaning the part of the compensation issue that the three powers of Britain, the United States, and France need to decide in their capacity as occupying countries. According to reliable sources, Dutch representative Van Doornan reiterated that all compensation issues are of interest to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg still did not attend today's meeting, so it is expected that the discussion was about the merger of the three occupied zones of West Germany. With only two days left until the closing date, it is expected that representatives from the six countries will participate in the meeting on the 4th. The land issue has not yet been discussed, or it should be raised for discussion on the 4th.

### Turkey Agrees to Participate in Sixteen-Country Conference

British and American Fleets Will Visit Turkish Ports

[Reuters Ankara 4th Dispatch] Turkey has accepted the invitation from Britain and France today and promised to participate in the Marshall Plan Paris Conference on March 15.

[Agence France-Presse Ankara 4th Dispatch] According to Turkish newspapers, British and American fleets will visit Turkish ports on the 16th. It is heard that the fleet visiting Turkey this time includes the aircraft carrier "Midway" and will visit the two Turkish ports of Smyrna and Istanbul.

### France and Italy Will Sign Customs Union

[United Press Paris 4th Dispatch] The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Foreign Minister Bidault will soon go to Turin to sign a French-Italian customs union treaty with Italian Foreign Minister Sforza.

### Michael Announces He Was Forced to Abdicate, Foreign Instigation Behind the Scenes

[Our Report] London 4th Broadcast; Former Romanian King Michael publicly stated for the first time today that his abdication was due to the coercion of the Communist Party. He still recognizes himself as the actual king, which shows that he still intends to restore the throne when the time is right in the future. Although he did not directly name the Soviet Union, he asked the Romanian Communist Party to force his abdication. The action was instigated behind the scenes by a foreign country, and the Communist Party government cannot represent public opinion at all.

### Italy Plans to Conclude Friendship Treaties with China, Britain, and France

[Agence France-Presse Rome 3rd Dispatch] Italy intends to negotiate friendship treaties with China and France. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now planning to conclude the same treaty with Britain, hoping to have preliminary talks with the governments concerned in the near future.

### Bevin Says British Territory in Antarctica Will Never Be Abandoned

Protests to Guatemala for Attacks on British Consulate

[United Press London 3rd Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin told the Lower House that the recent landings by Argentina and Chile on British territory in Antarctica were illegal. Although the British naval power has been reduced compared to before the war, the country must protect its rights in Antarctica. Bevin also guaranteed that Britain still has sufficient strength to protect British Honduras from aggression.

[Reuters London 3rd Dispatch] The British Minister to Guatemala lodged a note with the Guatemalan Foreign Minister yesterday, severely protesting the dishonorable events that occurred in Guatemala City yesterday. The protest stated: Yesterday afternoon, the demonstration in front of the British Embassy, in addition to removing the British flag and hanging the Guatemalan flag, also hung a pirate flag with a skull pattern on the flagpole.

### British Upper House Debates Foreign Policy, Condemns Imitation of Hitler's Threat to Peace

[Reuters London 3rd Dispatch] The House of Lords held a foreign policy debate on the 3rd, involving the expansion of Soviet power in Eastern Europe and the recent events in Czechoslovakia and Finland. Lord Pakenham, speaking on behalf of the government, compared the Communist Party's seizure of power in Czechoslovakia to Hitler's methods, believing it to be a premeditated action. He also said that Finland will soon follow suit and has been kissed by death. He also said that one of the lessons that can be learned from recent events is that no group, whether it is a government, a trade union, or any other institution, can allow the Communist Party to participate, otherwise these groups will be swallowed up by the Communist Party sooner or later. Opposition leader Salisbury said that the Soviet Union's policy has adopted a new and terrible approach. Hitler's personality has been found in Soviet decision-makers, just like Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia and aggression against the Soviet Union. Today's Soviet Union has also included Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Although Britain is willing to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union, the events of the past week have made it impossible for it to ignore the threat that is once again enveloping all of Europe. The question from now on is no longer to avoid the division of Europe, but to prevent the East from annexing Western Europe. What is exciting is Britain's decision to unite Western Europe. He hopes that Foreign Secretary Bevin can go to Belgium in person to achieve rapid and effective results. Former chief diplomatic advisor to the British government Vansittart also said that Stalin has taken the risk of starting a war in Europe, just like Hitler. From now on, Britain's pro-Stalinism should be viewed with the same eyes as Hitler, and treaties with totalitarian countries must not be trusted. The events in Czechoslovakia should mark the end of the period of fantasy.

According to the British-Soviet trade agreement, the first batch of Soviet grain arrived in London last December. (US News Service)

### British-Soviet Trade Agreement, Trading Weapons for Food, British Members of Parliament Express Opposition

[Central News Agency London 3rd Associated Press] British MP Robertson said in the Lower House that according to the British-Soviet trade and financial agreement, Britain will send weapons of war to the Soviet Union. He said that the price of purchasing livestock and other food with heavy industrial machinery, that is, weapons of war, is too high. If the allied countries, autonomous territories, and colonies of the British continent feel that we are supplying the potential for war to a country that does nothing but war, we will be greatly disturbed. He requested the abolition of this agreement. Lower House member Stock also opposed this agreement because Britain should not trade with a country that confines seventeen to twenty million people to slave labor camps.

### Western Europe Is Strained Financially and Urgently Needs US Aid

US Loans to Britain Have Been Completely Used Up

[Reuters Washington 3rd Dispatch] US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett said at a press conference today that Western European countries have now declared that they are using the funds they have obtained. If Congress does not pass the Marshall Plan on April 1, the financial situation of Western European countries will become more and more difficult. France is particularly lacking in US dollars, and several other countries have also "gone to the edge."

[Reuters Washington 3rd Dispatch] The US Treasury Department announced today that Britain has used all of the $3.75 billion it borrowed from the US. The last $100 million was obtained on Monday of this week. The huge loan was originally expected to last for three to five years, but as a result, it was used up in 20 months.

### Finland's Final Attitude Towards Soviet Proposals Awaits Decision

[United Press Gothenburg, Sweden 4th Dispatch] Five political parties in Finland are expected to decide on their position on Soviet proposals tonight, but will not submit a response to the president until five days later.

### China and Canada Oppose US Proposal, Support Belgian Amendment, Advocate Prior Investigation of Holy Land Situation

[Reuters, Lake Success, 3rd] The Security Council met today with Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu serving as rotating chairman. China and Canada jointly opposed accepting the principle of partitioning Palestine without first investigating the entire issue. China and Canada both support the Belgian amendment, opposing the acceptance of the partition principle in the US resolution without a full investigation into the possibility that the situation in Palestine threatens peace. The Canadian representative, McNaughton, supported the appointment of an advisory committee to the Security Council and urged the five powers to resolve the issue through mediation. Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu pointed out the contradiction in the US position, stating that while the US claims it does not intend to use force to support the UN General Assembly's partition resolution, it simultaneously supports the Security Council using force if necessary to thwart threats to international peace. The Council subsequently announced a postponement of the session to Friday. (Note: The Soviet Union has, in principle, expressed acceptance of the US proposal; see yesterday's dispatch.)

[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] China and Canada today blocked the US attempt to have the Security Council swiftly approve the Palestine partition plan. Both countries stated that the five powers should exert their utmost efforts to reach an agreement to resolve the Palestine issue. It is considered certain that the US chief representative Austin's proposal will not be approved by the Security Council.

### US Republican Lawmakers Advocate Military Alliance Against Soviet Union, Vandenberg Expresses Disagreement

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Republican Senator Wiley stated that a military alliance against the Soviet Union is necessary, claiming that the UN has ceased to function due to the Soviet Union's use of the veto, and that "we should seek every means." He, along with [Senator] Kem and several other Republican senators, advocated using force if necessary to halt the "Soviet Union's aggression agenda." Reportedly, Senate leader Vandenberg believes that this proposal would weaken Western Europe's self-help revival plan and could jeopardize the future of the United Nations. Baur's proposal stipulates that the President and Secretary of State immediately begin negotiations with other UN member states to organize a new eleven-nation "Supreme Council" to take over the peacekeeping powers currently held by the Security Council. Prior to joining the "Supreme Council," each nation should guarantee that, if seven of the eleven nations, including more than half of the major powers, decide that force must be used to maintain peace, that nation will contribute its military forces.

### Japanese Socialist Party Consultations Result in Decision that Katayama Will Not Join Cabinet, Three-Party Leaders Meeting Therefore Postponed

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] State Minister Takeda, at the behest of Democratic Party Secretary-General Ashida, visited Socialist Party Chairman Katayama on the morning of the 4th, inviting him to attend the three-party leaders' meeting on the 4th. At the same time, he proposed that Katayama join the cabinet as Foreign Minister, before attending the three-party leaders' meeting. However, Katayama responded with a reservation, promising to reply by the 9th. However, at 2 PM, President Ashida and Takeda met with Katayama again, inviting him to join the cabinet as Foreign Minister, but Katayama firmly declined. After the meeting, the Socialist Party convened a Central Executive Committee to discuss Katayama's cabinet entry. As a result of the discussions, no one supported it, and it was decided that someone other than Katayama would participate in the Ashida Cabinet to cooperate. Therefore, Katayama visited Ashida again, replying that he could not join the cabinet.

Takeda then announced: "For the stability of the current political situation, the Socialist Party leader Katayama's joining the cabinet is absolutely necessary, so it was decided that Prime Minister Ashida will visit Katayama again on the 5th to make another earnest request." Therefore, the three-party leaders' meeting of the Socialists, Democrats, and People's Cooperative Party, scheduled to be held on the 4th, was postponed to the 5th.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] It is expected that Katayama's refusal to participate in the cabinet will cause Ashida to lose a large part of his stabilizing force.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The preparatory committee of the conservative new party organized by the Yoshida faction in Japan has been actively carrying out organizational work recently because the policy agreement of the Ashida cabinet has been successfully concluded, preparing to submit a motion of no confidence in the Ashida cabinet in the Diet in the future, or to demand the dissolution of the Diet and re-election. It is heard that the preparatory committee has drafted the party platform, party discipline, and policies yesterday, and after several consultations to determine the party name, it can hold a founding meeting on the 15th.

### World Rice Conference Passes Indian Proposal

General Assembly's Three Committees Have Begun Work

Sixteen national agricultural experts gathered to study various rice problems from a narrower perspective, thereby putting forward proposals aimed at preventing famine in Asia. The Rice Trade and Distribution Committee decided to prohibit reporters from attending, so as to freely exchange frank opinions on many advanced technical issues and avoid being "distortedly reported." It is reported that the committee, after working all day, only adopted India's proposals, namely: (1) each country should adopt its own standards of weight and measure; (2) each country should submit reports of its production and international trade statistics in metric tons and hectares; (3) The Food and Agriculture Organization may be required to consult with international agencies studying weights and measures to investigate and submit a report at the next meeting.

Missing Old Friends Truly Makes One Overwhelmed with Sorrow

On July 20, 1944, some time before Roosevelt was nominated in Chicago to compete for his fourth term as president, he again suggested at the White House that I be nominated as vice president. He said he knew that if I were willing, I could get the nomination.

But the President knew I wouldn't accept it, because the war was still going on and I was immersed in diplomatic work. Just as I had repeatedly refused similar proposals in 1940, I felt that in this situation, I could contribute more as Secretary of State than as Vice President. I expressed my gratitude for the President's kindness, but said that I was concentrating on foreign policy and didn't think I could disrupt it.

A fourth term seemed more natural to the public, including myself, than a third. The tradition had already been broken.

In 1944 we were at war, while in 1940 we were not. The President felt the situation was difficult, we were like in the vast ocean, and he was at the helm. So he should give way to the general demand and run for re-election again.

I did not participate in the subsequent election campaign.

The President sent me a memorandum, dated September 29, 1944, in which he said: "I very much hope that when you make plans, you can manage to broadcast speeches twice between now and election day. The country needs your clear thinking and needs to stay informed at all times."

He then said he wanted to give a speech on foreign policy between then and election day, and if I could draft it for him, he would be "forever very grateful."

When I received this memorandum, I was preparing to visit the President at the White House next Sunday and inform him that I would resign. I visited him on the scheduled date, and in a mood of profound disappointment, I told the President that I had worked hard for a considerable time, and now I found that my health was such that I had to resign. I said I would leave the office in the next day or two and go straight to bed, and I would have to stay there, I didn't know how long.

The President didn't seem to believe me. Before I left his office, we talked rather casually. The issue of preparing speeches for him and my giving two campaign speeches was not mentioned at the time or thereafter, although the State Department later helped the President prepare his main foreign policy speeches during the campaign.

Three days later, October 2, which was my seventy-third birthday, I left the State Department, already a person plagued with illnesses. I spent eighteen days in my apartment trying to recover, but to no avail. During this period, I continued to do some work, after which I was sent to the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where I stayed for about seven months, and sometimes my condition was extremely serious. The astonishing tension of nearly twelve years in the State Department completely exhausted me, because it was during one of the most serious periods in our country's life, and no term of office of any Secretary of State in history was even half as long as mine.

Shortly after arriving at the hospital, the President sent White House physician Admiral McIntyre to diagnose my condition and make me believe that in a reasonable time, I could fully recover and resume my duties. Then the President came to visit me, stayed for an hour and a half, and at that time he urged me not to resign as the best policy. He guaranteed that I could take leave for a period of time and return to the State Department's office after a reasonable period of time.

I did not hesitate but quickly expressed my unwillingness not to resign. I said that the pain of resigning after my huge plans to which I had devoted myself had not been adopted was second only to losing my life. But I also said that in order to promote these great efforts, I had almost exhausted my energy, and on the ladder of my physical strength, I had been reduced to the lowest level. I said that I could not continue to hold office and assume its extraordinary responsibilities on the one hand and try to recover my health on the other.

The President then did his best to urge me not to resign until his current term ended on January 20, 1945. I replied that, personally, I would be extremely happy to do so, but I pointed out that if I did so, critics would almost immediately notice the major responsibilities falling on me and the State Department, and would sympathize with my illness on the one hand, and on the other hand would soon insist that the urgent nature of the current situation required a Secretary of State to be seated in the State Department, and as a result, they would criticize the President for mishandling things.

Mr. Roosevelt then asked me not to resign temporarily, at least until after the election. I agreed to this.

On November 21, the President wrote me a wonderful letter, beginning by saying that my letter "put me in a dilemma." He continued, "It makes me extremely uncomfortable just to think that our close relationship of twelve years is about to end. This is not only because our relationship has always been extremely harmonious, or because our joint work has achieved success in so many ways, but more because of my personal feelings, that is, from now on I will no longer be able to rely on your help and your kind exchange of opinions.

"I feel this way especially because we have come so far on the road to friendly relations internationally, and I am very eager to rely on your help to bring this work to its final stage in the current situation, which is still extremely complex and difficult.

"Your health is indeed of the utmost concern, and I truly believe that you can recover in a relatively short period of time, even if in the future you can limit yourself to special work and avoid the daily affairs of the State Department. So today, you must focus all your thoughts on getting well soon, and all your friends will help you with this."

He then repeated his suggestion that I continue to practice until the fourth term began, saying:

"If you must do this, I will of course accept your resignation as Secretary of State. But I hope you will agree to a compromise, that is, allow me to accept it when our third term ends on January 20. Perhaps there is a little bit of emotional effect in this, but it will make me feel happy from the bottom of my heart if we can complete the third term. That is to say, there are still two months, and during this time I can often come to see you and listen to your opinions on some of the things we may encounter."

The President then made a suggestion, and if I could accept it, it would indeed be most intimate to my heart. He said, "I mention in passing that when the United Nations is established, I will continue to pray that you, as the father of the United Nations, will be able to serve as chairman at its first meeting. This has nothing to do with whether you are still Secretary of State at this time, and the position should be held by you, because you are the one in the world who has contributed the most to making this great peace plan a concrete reality. You have contributed to friendly relations internationally in so many different ways, so even if you are no longer serving in government, you will continue to help the world with your moral guidance."

He ended the letter with words of concern.

The President's plea was so touching to my heart that I did indeed have a sincere conversation with the doctors who were treating me. Their reply was that I would not be able to return to my office for a long time in the future. So I thought that accepting the President's suggestion to stay in office until January 20 would not be fair to the government or to myself. A new Secretary of State should be appointed to replace me. And I felt that as the head of the State Department, I should be responsible for foreign policy, but I was not actively involved in the formulation of these policies.

So on November 23, I replied to the President, telling him that I was deeply moved by his letter, and would always be grateful for his sincere concern for my health and for his praise of our twelve years of close personal and official relationship. After reiterating the personal tragedy that my health situation made it impossible for me to continue in public service, and that I would always cherish our friendship and affection, I said:

"I sincerely hope to be able to fulfill your wish, that is, my resignation as Secretary of State may not take effect now but on January 20. I have consulted with my doctor again. The speed of my recovery is certainly related to avoiding all worries and responsibilities. You must be able to understand that as long as I am the Secretary of State, I cannot put aside the important responsibilities of the Secretary of State. In order to be loyal to you and the goals we have always pursued, loyal to the country, loyal to you, and loyal to myself, I feel that my resignation must take effect now."

I repeated that as soon as my health recovered, I would be completely at your command, and I would be happy to engage in anything that I could personally contribute to the solution of major problems in the future.

The President now accepted my resignation and announced it on November 27. He appointed Undersecretary of State Stettinius to succeed me. My term officially ended on November 30, 1944.

The President came to see me at the hospital several times. One time, he looked very tired—at that time he was only a few weeks away from death—I was lying in bed, and he said to me, "I should be where you are."

During the long seven months I spent in the hospital, I was often cheered by signs that, although I was no longer in office, my work had not been forgotten.

I received a telegram from the Yalta Conference, signed by Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, Molotov, Eden and Stettinius, saying: "We send you our heartfelt greetings for not being with us at this meeting. We hope you recover quickly so that we can all be together again."

I should state here that neither the President nor anyone else consulted with me on policy issues before or during the Yalta Conference. When the President was about to depart for Yalta, he came to see me at the hospital, but did not mention to me any of the topics he expected to discuss with Stalin and Churchill or any decisions he might make. I was not notified in advance of the objectives of our government at any other important meeting thereafter, with the exception of the San Francisco Conference.

Two months after the Yalta Conference, I was stunned by the sudden death of President Roosevelt on April 12. He had come to see me the day before going to Hyde Park and then to Warm Springs, Georgia. A few days later, he died there. When he came to see me this time, I advised him to pay attention to his health and said he should rest more. He said he was leaving the next day for that purpose.

In my opinion, President Roosevelt was the greatest social reformer in our modern history, even if many people may disagree with some of his reforms. As Commander-in-Chief, his achievements stand out among those of other Commanders-in-Chief. In my opinion, he was unmatched in political skill in his time. As far as I know, he has always been a sincere believer in personal freedom and other fundamental rights and privileges, which are necessary for ordinary citizens. These include the ideals of justice, law and order. In terms of views, he was strong, consistent and often extremely liberal. The steps he took militarily led us directly to victory, and these steps also had the greatest significance diplomatically, because military success gave our diplomacy indispensable support and strength.

### Resolutions of the Assembly of Councillors: Request to Suspend the Livestock Market; Postpone the Enforcement of the Dance Ban

Emergency Motion to Support the Chairman as the First President; Requesting a Telegram to the US Government and Public to Implement Full-Scale Aid to China

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Yesterday was the tenth day of the fifth general meeting of the Municipal Assembly of Councillors. The eighth meeting was held in the afternoon to continue discussing proposals regarding civil affairs, society, and public works. The meeting was originally scheduled to adjourn yesterday, but due to the large number of proposals for discussion, it was decided to extend it by two days, adjourning at 7 p.m. tomorrow.

Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and Councillors Gao Shu'an, Yang Gongmou (Social Democratic Party), Wang Xingguo (Youth Party), and forty-one others, jointly submitted an emergency proposal yesterday: "Proposing that the Assembly unanimously support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government as the first president." A vote will be requested from the Assembly today. Furthermore, Cheng Qian, Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, recently sent a letter to the Municipal Assembly of Councillors, also requesting support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the first president. The original letter stated: "With the election approaching, our Chairman Chiang has led the revolution, pacifying internally and resisting externally, with great achievements that have shaken the past and present. In the future, suppressing the rebellion and building the nation will be a heavy responsibility and a long journey. The position of president is destined for him. Although he is occupied with countless affairs every day and has no time to compete in the election, our national public opinion should be expressed. The public opinion organs of Hubei Province are holding regular meetings and sending special telegrams to attending representatives, unanimously supporting him. The people of your city must share this sentiment, and we hope you will lead all sectors to respond unanimously."

In addition, there was an emergency motion by the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and fourteen councillors including Wang Wei-yin, stating: "The communist bandits are destroying national unity and hindering the great plan for revival. The severity of this problem not only concerns the safety of China but also affects peace in the Far East. At this critical military juncture, our government should renew its politics, improve its economy, rectify its military, and strive for revitalization in order to quickly suppress the bandit rebellion. However, after a long period of war, our country is exhausted, and the people are suffering. We must appeal to our allies for assistance. Recent reports indicate that the US government has proposed an economic aid plan for China, but it is still under discussion and does not include military aid, which is still too slow to address the overall situation in China. This Assembly, representing the citizens of the entire city, should not only urge our government to promptly implement thorough political, economic, financial, and military reforms but also send a telegram to the US government and public, based on the people's standpoint, urging them not to delay full-scale aid to China any longer. Effective measures should be implemented quickly to stabilize our economy, strengthen our military, eliminate the bandit atmosphere, restore construction, and share the mission of preventing human warfare and ensuring lasting world peace with our allies. Is this appropriate? We respectfully request your decision." This case will also be decided in today's general meeting.

Diverse Speeches and Statements: Abuses of the Livestock Market

The proposals discussed yesterday regarding the social sector: (1) During the general meeting, there were diverse expressions of opposition to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's plan to establish a jointly run public-private Shanghai Livestock Market Co., Ltd. The original proposal stated that it "controls and exploits, harms merchants and people, and requests that the Municipal Government forward the proposal to the Central Government to order the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to abolish it." Ge Yuping, a specialist from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, made a special trip to the meeting to explain that the livestock market is in the planning stage, and the government has no intention of increasing the people's burden. He personally has no preconceived notions about this, and if the Assembly believes that it should be postponed or not implemented, it can advise the Ministry of Agriculture. However, the rationality of the principle and the need for the system should be considered. Whether the management is perfect is a matter of personnel. Councillors Xie Dahuang, Chen Baotai, Wang Yansong, Huang Zhensheng, Yan Esheng, Zhou Lianze, Jiang Hao, and others gave speeches, all stating the abuses of establishing a market. Finally, the general meeting unanimously passed a resolution recommending to the Central Government: "Please assist the livestock production industry first to increase the source of meat and abolish the preparation of the livestock market."

Regarding the Dance Ban Issue: Two Resolutions Passed by the Assembly

(2) Regarding the case of rescinding the order to ban dancing, Zhang Zhihan, Zhang Zhongyuan, and others once again requested the Municipal Government to submit the resolution of the previous Assembly to the Central Government. Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau also repeatedly stated that if the Central Government does not indicate, it will not automatically implement the ban. The original proposal for the case was "Please severely punish the masterminds of the thugs who destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau, release the innocent, and rescind the order to ban dancing to promote the rule of law and pacify the good people." The Assembly passed three resolutions: (1) Send a letter to the government requesting that the thugs who destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau be severely punished according to the law, and that those with insufficient evidence of guilt be released quickly. (2) Considering that stability is the top priority during this period of suppression, Shanghai's dance halls have a long history, and a large number of people are employed, with no fewer than tens of thousands directly or indirectly relying on them for a living. The situation is indeed different from other cities. Therefore, before the job transition of dance hall employees and dancers is properly resolved, the Municipal Government should continue to be requested to forward the resolution of the previous Assembly to the Central Government to postpone enforcement. (3) Send a letter to the Municipal Government requesting that the Social Affairs Bureau postpone the enforcement of the order on dance halls that have not yet been selected until new instructions are received from the Central Government.

After this wireless telephone call, the friendship and cooperation between China and the United Kingdom will enter a new stage. He sincerely hopes that the wireless telephone call will help the prosperity and welfare of the two countries. Smith thanked Mayor Wu for his call on behalf of the citizens of London, and said: As far as I know, the Chinese learned to make the earliest means of transportation in the world three thousand years ago.

### Thirty-Six Gold Francs for a Three-Minute Call

After the end of the call ceremony, the Telegraph Agency and the International Radio Station held a banquet for guests from all walks of life at the Xinghualou Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. During the banquet, Director Yu said: The International Wireless Telephone of the Telegraph Agency, which is still in preparation, also has China-France Line, China-Philippines Line, and Hong Kong Line. After the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, the China-Japan Line will also be opened. The engineer explained the international telecommunications charges, which are based on gold francs in accordance with the International Telecommunications Convention (the United States is not a signatory country, so China-US telephone calls are converted into US dollars). The temporary rate is 48,500 yuan per gold franc. The current charge is 36 francs every three minutes, which is equivalent to 1,746,000 yuan. This is a temporary rate and will be adjusted at any time in the future. It is also said that wireless phones are equipped with confidentiality equipment, and ordinary radios cannot receive them, so there is no way to leak secrets.

### Scenery of Mount Jishi - Majestic Peaks Beyond Imagination

[Report from our newspaper] Zhuang Xueben, consultant of the Xikang Provincial Government and manager of the Shanghai branch of the Kangzang Trade Company, is presenting photographs he took more than a decade ago during his travels in Kangzang. This is to introduce the actual situation of Mount Jishi to people in Shanghai before the upcoming departure of the Sino-American Mount Jishi Survey Team. More than 130 photos will be publicly exhibited at the French Literature Society on Nanchang Road on the 6th and 7th of this month. A preview will be held today for invited guests. The exhibited photographs, in addition to the scenery of the Mount Jishi area and the lives of tribal peoples, also include Muli Gonga, taken by the author from 1935 to 1938, and numerous photographs of famous mountains and rivers from east longitude 96 degrees to 103 degrees and north latitude 29 degrees to 36 degrees, which are extremely valuable. Mr. Zhuang, a native of Shanghai, was very interested in ethnology at an early age. In 1934, he planned to travel to Tibet alone, but failed. In Chengdu, he heard that the people of Oros (the southern area of Mount Jishi) were barbaric and had not yet emerged from primitive life, so he decided to go there. Passing through the Qiangxi and Zhukeji areas, the journey was exceptionally difficult and sparsely populated. He walked during the day and stayed in forests and valleys at night. Moreover, the climate was unpredictable, and the rapids were turbulent everywhere. He suffered greatly from the hardships of travel, hunger, and cold. Fortunately, he was cared for by chieftains along the way, and he reached Mosang. At that time, the local residents were at war with the Gansu side, and the residents asked Zhuang to mediate. After the end of the war, the tribal chief expressed his gratitude by ordering his son to become sworn brothers with Zhuang, and sent escorts to take him directly to the south bank of the Yellow River, i.e., the southern foot of the Bayan Har Mountain, before returning to Songpan. The journey lasted a total of nine months. According to Zhuang Xueben, the main peak of Mount Jishi, Amne Machin, is extremely magnificent, with continuous peaks and breathtaking scenery, which is beyond the imagination of people in the Jiangnan region. The average altitude of the plains in the area is over 4,000 meters, and it is home to 48 to 52 tribes.

### Movie Ticket Prices Rise by 50% First - First-Run Films Cost 30,000 to 70,000

[Report from our newspaper] The film industry in this city previously submitted a document to the Social Bureau requesting a price increase, which was approved for an increase of 80% and will be implemented starting today. However, because the film industry was afraid that the price increase would affect business, after consultation, it was decided to first increase the price by 50% starting today. At the same time, because the industry's employee salaries and electricity and other expenses are all increased according to the cost of living index or automatic adjustment method, it was decided to continue to submit a document to the Social Bureau requesting that movie ticket prices also be adjusted according to the automatic adjustment method. If prices fluctuate again during the period of applying for ticket prices to be adjusted automatically, the 30% that has not been increased after approval will be implemented immediately. Today, the price will first be increased by 50%. The new ticket prices for various film theaters are as follows: First-run films cost 30,000 to 70,000 yuan.

### Shandong Women's Legislator Election - An Interlude in the Mandarin Duck Score - "Original Wife" Accuses Husband of Bigamy - Son Denies Mother is Alive

[Jin'an, 1st Dispatch] The results of the Shandong Provincial Legislative Council election have not yet been officially announced by the provincial election office as of the time of this reporter's writing. However, the disputes caused by the election are already varied and endless. What is being discussed here is the question of the "original wife" of Education Director Li Taihua after Mrs. Chen Jiujing, the wife of the current Education Director of Shandong Province, participated in the Shandong women's group legislative election as a social figure. This has been unanimously recognized in Jinan as the most tortuous and complicated election dispute, and the question of whether an education director is guilty of "bigamy" has naturally become the most important social news.

Repeatedly Claims - My Husband

The course of events began on February 24th, when the Nanjing Jiuguo Daily published a piece by "Li Yangshi" entitled "Shandong Education Director Commits Bigamy". The original text is as follows: "My husband, his surname is Li and his name is Taihua, is currently the Education Director of the Shandong Provincial Government. I followed my husband through hardship and turmoil for eight years during the war. In the spring of 1942, my husband Li Taihua had a change of heart and cohabitated with a woman named Chen Jiujing. From then on, my husband's attitude, and everything about him, changed. After the victory, when Chairman He became the chairman of Shandong, Li Taihua was appointed as the education director. My husband was afraid that people in society would look at him with suggestive eyes, so he secretly married in Tianjin last year. My husband has threatened me many times, telling me not to publicize it. I have endured the pain and lived with my mother-in-law in a relative's house, living in a broken room. Now my mother-in-law is sick, and he has not visited his own mother once, and there is no money for medical treatment, so we can only rely on friends for help. My husband lives every day in his mistress Chen Jiujing's residence, which is a Western-style house in Qilu University, and is served by many people such as servants and housekeepers. He does not care about his own mother, let alone his original wife. This time, my husband has also allowed his mistress to run for some kind of legislator. My husband uses his power to get the counties to support his mistress Chen Jiujing. My husband uses his personal influence to force the county magistrates to guarantee a certain number of votes. I really can't stand what my husband is doing, I have endured it to the end. I appeal to the public to let the whole country know, Li Yangshi bows."

Urgent Announcement - Declaring Divorce

Next, Director Li and his son Zhishao posted the following announcement in the Shandong New News, the official newspaper of the Shandong Provincial Government, starting on the 29th:

Li Taihua's Urgent Announcement

Having read the report in the Nanjing Jiuguo Daily of February 24th entitled "Shandong Education Director Commits Bigamy", I am extremely surprised. It has been investigated that I and my original wife, Yangshi, had incompatible feelings, and in the summer of 1929, after negotiation by both relatives and friends Yang Liangpu and Han Tianzhen (both of whom are currently in Jinan), we agreed to divorce. All of the family property was owned by Yangshi, and the son, Li Zhishao, was fully responsible for raising and educating him. Yangshi died of tiger plague in the autumn of 1943. Now someone is borrowing a name and fabricating facts. Its intention is to disrupt my wife Chen Jiujing's participation in the legislative election. It is not only defiling my name. In addition to correcting the newspaper, I hereby solemnly declare this in order to correct public perception.

Li Zhishao's Urgent Announcement

Having read the news in the Nanjing Jiuguo Daily of February 24th entitled "Shandong Education Director Commits Bigamy", I am extremely surprised. After investigation, my father, Li Taihua, and my late mother, Yangshi, divorced in the summer of 1929 after negotiation between both relatives and friends. My late mother died of tiger plague in the autumn of 1943. All of the newspaper's claims are fabricated by others under false pretenses and concern my father's and stepmother's reputation. I hereby declare this in order to correct public perception.

Senator Lü Expresses Surprise

After these two announcements were published, the next day, all the newspapers here published a piece of news sent by Ms. Lü Yunzhang, Deputy Director of the Central Women's Movement Committee and Senator of the National Political Council. The content is as follows: "Female Senator Lü Yunzhang was deeply surprised to read two announcements in the Shandong New News of February 29th by Education Director Li Taihua and his son Li Zhishao, saying that Director Li's wife, Li Yangshi, had passed away long ago. The reason is that Yunzhang went to Dr. Lü's place at No. 445, Weiliu Road, Jing'er Road on February 16th for medical treatment because of illness. During a casual conversation, Dr. Lü unintentionally said that Li Taihua's mother, Li Liushi, and his wife, Li Yangshi, both live downstairs in this hospital and are living a very difficult life as the mother and wife of a company commander. His mother is sick and has no money for treatment, and Dr. Lü is providing pure voluntary assistance, etc. This proves that Director Li's original wife, Li Yangshi, is indeed still alive. A director who bears the important responsibility of education has such unfilial and unjust behavior, and Chairman Wang, who is known for his filial piety, should deal with this." Whether Director Li's original wife is still alive? Whether Director Li formally divorced his original wife? Due to a letter from Senator Lü, many people felt lost, and the development of future facts remains to be proven. However, one point can be added: according to reliable estimates from all sides, Mrs. Li, Chen Jiujing, is participating in the Shandong women's group legislative election. Although the provincial election office has not yet announced the results, everyone seems to believe that Mrs. Chen's election is no problem. The problem is that after Mrs. Chen is elected as a legislator as a social figure, although the number of votes for the candidates from the People's, Youth, and other parties is small, the central government has long stipulated that they should not be allowed to concede. On the other hand, among the Kuomintang candidates Lü Yunzhang, Wang Junying, and Bao Lin, one person must "give way".

### Shandong Education Director Li Taihua - The Mystery of the Original Wife

[Jinan, 4th Dispatch] Regarding the mystery of Education Director Li Taihua's bigamy, after the Shandong New News published that Li Yangshi, who lives at No. 445 Jing'er Weiliu Road, is the widow of Li Weiheng of Qiuxian, and not Li Taihua's original wife, the Dahua Daily here published on the 4th the talk of Senator Lü Yunzhang, saying that "Li Yangshi is indeed Li Taihua's original wife, and if he denies it, he can come in person to confront her, and the truth will be revealed." The reporter of the newspaper then visited Li Yangshi and Li's mother, Li Liushi, (according to people in the same hospital, Li Yangshi and Li Liushi have been taken away by someone who looked like a public official, and their whereabouts are unknown.) In this way, the Li Taihua case of bigamy, which has attracted much attention, may not be able to reveal its mystery in the short term. [Another Dispatch] There is a new development in the "mystery of bigamy" of Shandong Education Director Li Taihua, which caused a sensation in Jinan. Previously, female Senator Lü Yunzhang pointed out that Li Yangshi, who lived at No. 445 Jing'er Weiliu Road, was Li Taihua's original wife, but according to a report in the Shandong New News, the official newspaper of the provincial government, on the 3rd, the newspaper interviewed Mr. Liu Pingxuan, who said: "Li Yangshi is indeed someone, that is, my cousin-in-law. As for being the original wife of Director Li, this is simply an insult to our family. My cousin Li Weiheng has already passed away, how could my cousin-in-law have a husband again?" However, the newspaper said in its conclusion: "What the truth is remains to be proven by future facts." Therefore, it is as the newspaper's headline says, "Who is randomly pointing the Mandarin Duck score, the mystery is confusing and detailed guesses are required." It is reported that Li Taihua's current wife is Mrs. Chen Jiujing, from Sichuan, a student who studied in the United States, and has only been married to Li for more than a year. This time, she participated in the Lu women's legislative election as a social figure at the persuasion of her husband. According to reports, she received a lot of votes. Therefore, it is widely rumored here that this Li Taihua incident was caused by his wife's involvement in the legislative election.

### Judgment on the Lanzhou Student-Military Police Conflict - Chief Culprit, Military Police Sentenced to Three Years in Prison - Medical Expenses Borne by the Military Police Regiment

[Lanzhou, 4th Dispatch] The Lanzhou student-military police conflict has been resolved thanks to appropriate handling by the authorities in recent days. After the Xingyuan Military Law Office held an investigation hearing on February 27, detailed results were obtained, and the verdict was announced on the 3rd. More than a dozen teachers and students from Lanzhou University attended the hearing. Deputy Director Cai Yadong read the judgment, the main points of which are: Criminal Part: The chief culprit, military police Cui Delin, was sentenced to three years in prison, and the other two accomplices were each sentenced to imprisonment.

Another dispatch: On February 29th, at around 5 am, six people were found posting slogans on Lizhi Road in Lanzhou, and a teenager was arrested. This reporter was able to see the slogan yesterday, which was two feet long and three inches wide, written on white earth paper with a brush, and clearly written by one person. It contained absurd sentences such as "We want to support the February 25th tragedy", "Support the New Democratic Government", and "Protect People's Freedom". The Lanzhou University February 25th Tragedy Support Association firmly denies that it issued the slogan.

### Murder for Money, Arson to Eliminate Traces: Zhengzhou Agricultural Bank Teller Sun Zhixiang's Heinous Act; Deceased Guo Lingyu Suffered More Than Thirty Knife Wounds

[Special Dispatch from Zhengzhou by Our Newspaper, 27th] On the 26th in Zhengzhou, a shocking case of murder for money and arson to eliminate traces occurred, causing a city-wide sensation. The victim, Guo Lingyu, 25 years old, from Sichuan, was the wife of Captain Fu Yuan of the Artillery Battalion of the 94th Brigade of the Fifth Army. The perpetrator was Sun Zhixiang, 25 years old, from Luoyang, a teller at the local Agricultural Bank. The case was solved within hours, and the circumstances were quite tortuous. At around 1 PM, a fire broke out at Zhengyi Flower Shop at No. 13 Liu Wanshun Street. At the time, the wind was strong and the fire was fierce, a truly terrifying scene. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and the fire brigade's rescue efforts were effective, preventing a major disaster. A woman and a sixteen-month-old girl were rescued from the scene. Unexpectedly, while clearing the scene, it was suddenly discovered that the rescued woman had her nose cut off, her right eyeball was protruding from its socket, her left eye was also sealed shut with thick blood, her face was unrecognizable, her throat had two knife wounds, each about an inch deep, her left hand had two fingers severed, and her right hand had five wounds, totaling more than twenty knife wounds. Her entire body was covered in blood, a gruesome sight. After receiving the report, Hong Minggao, the captain of the city's criminal investigation team, questioned Zhou Zhaoping, a female guest living with the victim, and her younger uncle, Sun Zhixiang, but obtained no leads. Subsequently, he took the two back to the station for further questioning. According to Zhou's statement, she was 19 years old, from Sichuan, and had married Sun Zhinian, the adjutant of the Advance Detachment of the 96th Brigade of the New Fifth Army, three years ago. Because her husband was deployed to the front lines, she lived with Guo Lingyu, the wife of her husband's colleague Zhang Suifu, and they had a good relationship. Her uncle, Sun Zhixiang, who worked at the Agricultural Bank in Hubei, would occasionally visit. In the morning, she went to see Sun Zhixiang about something, and then went to visit a Mrs. Liu at her home. When Deputy Adjutant Xiong of the Fifth Army came running, she learned that Guo had been killed and rushed back. When questioned, Sun simply shook his head and said he didn't know. Later, bloodstains were found on the corner of his blue cloth cotton-padded jacket and on the cuffs, and a long hair with bloodstains was found on the back of his cotton robe. Sun then confessed: The deceased, Guo Lingyu, had two taels of gold, a gold necklace, a gold bracelet, and a gemstone ring. Some time ago, she sold the gold necklace (weighing nine fen) and gave Sun 10 million yuan, entrusting him to deposit it in the bank to earn interest, but he had spent it all. Moreover, he had lost 20 million yuan gambling during the Spring Festival and could not repay it. His sister-in-law went to the bank to ask him for money twice on the 26th. Driven to desperation, he went to Guo's place and killed her, taking the two-plus taels of gold jewelry and setting a fire to cover up the traces.

### Xun Huisheng Flies to Beiping; Indicates Imminent Retirement from Stage Career

### Husband Joins the Army, Wife Violated: Xu Lianyuan Suffers Misfortune

[Special Dispatch from Wuxi by Our Newspaper, 2nd] Xu Lianyuan, a resident of the Seventh Household of the Seventh Jia of the Thirteenth Bao in Dongting Dongshan Township, Suzhou, is 22 years old. He comes from a poor family and makes a living by selling fruit. He married a local woman named Lu, and their relationship was very affectionate after the marriage. However, Lianyuan is a natural gambler. During the recent New Year, he lost repeatedly, resulting in a large deficit. Knowing that he could not make up for it, he heard that various townships and towns in this county needed to recruit volunteers. So, he asked his friend Gu Hongsheng to introduce him to Xin'an Town in the southern part of the county to serve as a volunteer, stating that the settlement fee was 44 million yuan. Xu Jinbao and Sun Ada, who specialized in selling conscripts, handled the matter and signed an agreement. Unexpectedly, Sun and Xu were both unemployed vagrants. After receiving the money, they only gave 14 million yuan to Lianyuan for his expenses, pocketing the rest. After being sent to the Wuxi Regiment Management District Headquarters in Huishan, Lianyuan was assigned to the Fourth Company of the new recruits for service. Because he was not accustomed to military life and thought about the pain of leaving his home and wife, he felt quite regretful. Therefore, he discussed it with the original introducer, Xu Jinbao, and offered to return all of the settlement fee and buy a substitute. After both parties agreed, they proceeded with the exchange, but it was unsuccessful due to physical incompatibility. Unable to do anything, Lianyuan escaped without a trace while being transferred to Shanghai for training. After the incident, the authorities immediately ordered a search. The introducer, Xu Jinbao, together with Zhang Honglie, the town chief of Xin'an Town, searched everywhere. On the 20th of last month, they used deceptive tactics on Lianyuan's wife, Lu, saying: Your husband is doing very well in the Regiment Management District, he has been winning big in gambling these days, and he has three gold rings that he urgently wants to give to you for household expenses. If you delay, you may not be able to see him, etc. Lu believed it to be true and followed them to the town. At the time, Jinbao immediately imprisoned her at the New Asia Hotel on Gongyuan Road. Around 11 PM that night, Jinbao brought a strange man named Xiao Tang to the bedroom, claiming he was mediating, and forced Lu to talk in detail at the nearby Gongyuan Hotel. Xiao Tang also used threats to rape Lu. From then on, she was continuously raped by the introducers, and Xu's mistress forcibly took Lu's earrings in the name of compensating for losses. At the same time, they forced Lu to take photos and sign a written guarantee to compensate the Xin'an Town Office for a loss of 2 million yuan. At the end of last month, Xu Lianyuan, who had escaped, was found by Town Chief Chen and sent to the county government's criminal investigation team for detention. The team notified Lu, and she was freed. Husband and wife met and poured out their hearts about their experiences since parting. Lianyuan was furious when he heard about his wife's deception and instructed Lu to report to the county government and ask for the arrest and punishment of Xu Jinbao and other conscription traffickers. At noon on the 2nd, Secretary Huang of the county government secretly dispatched two political police officers to the address. At No. 15 New Asia Hotel, they arrested Xu Jinbao and Xiao Tang (originally named Ruiquan) and seized a large number of criminal evidence such as ropes and conscription certificates, bringing them back to the county. The county government believes that these military service brokers have obviously engaged in threatening extortion and fraudulent behavior and should be severely punished to serve as a warning and eliminate harm to society.

### Jiangyin Huang Guicheng Case: Aftermath Still Awaiting Clarification; Police Headquarters Dispatches Personnel for Thorough Investigation

Huang, due to gambling losses, falsely claimed that 100 million yuan had been stolen. Former Police Chief Wei Huimin and the city defense department discovered the truth within twelve hours, and Huang Guicheng was sent to the court for trial. On the 17th, the original owner, Ji Zhesheng, went to the police station to collect the money. Former Chief Wei dispatched Judicial Section Chief Jiang Hua to meet with Ji to solicit 40 million yuan as a reward. Subsequently, Senators Han Guozhang and Zhu Zhenhao sent a letter to the county government stating that the money should be returned. Yang Ku merchants also filed a complaint with the province.

### Chao Lake Irrigation Area: Feather Production and Sales Remain Strong

[Special Dispatch from Huizhou, February 27th] Feathers have a wide range of uses, from bedding to decorations. China is a major producer of feathers, with Shanghai, Hankou, Kowloon, and Wuhu being the largest distribution centers. Although Wuhu's production of chicken and duck feathers is not as abundant as Shanghai's, its production of goose feathers is even greater. Farmers in the Chao Lake irrigation area have a special knack for goose farming, producing goose feathers that are thick and lustrous. Before the war, Wuhu's export of goose feathers occupied an important position in international trade. In 1928, the export of chicken feathers was 295 dan, valued at 44,000 taels of silver; duck feathers were 9 dan, valued at 207,000 taels of silver; and goose feathers were 6,113 dan, valued at 228,000 taels of silver. Later, feather merchants, seeking profit, mixed in dregs and powder, lowering the quality and credit, leading to a gradual decline in exports. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese paid close attention to feathers and rapeseed as they collected materials in Wuhu. In the past two years, feather production in the Chao Lake irrigation area and the Qingyi River area has remained abundant. Farmers are even more interested in raising poultry than before. Because the prices of chickens, ducks, geese, and eggs have risen, they have all listed poultry, eggs, and feathers as supplementary income to support their families. Currently, the market prices of poultry and eggs in the production area are very high. Chickens, ducks, and geese generally sell for 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per jin, and eggs sell for 2,500 to 3,000 yuan per egg. Because feathers are light in weight, it takes the feathers of dozens of geese to make a jin of goose feathers, and twice as many chickens or ducks. Last winter, the feather sales season was strong, and transactions suddenly became brisk. Sales to England also gradually increased. Special-grade chicken and duck feathers rose to 1.8 million yuan per hundred jin, and special-grade goose feathers rose to 2.6 million yuan per hundred. The export prospects of feathers in Wuhu are showing a new opportunity for improvement. (Reporter Ning Po)

### Tangqi in Spring, the Fruit Village North of Hangzhou: One Plum Every Five Steps, Fragrance Ten Miles Away

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 3rd] Tangqi, located sixty li from Hangzhou, is the fruit kingdom of Zhejiang, famous for its cherries, loquats, plums, apricots, peaches, sugarcane, and other produce. Due to the large-scale planting of fruit trees, the spring blossoms are particularly abundant, especially the blooming of plum blossoms, which is a spectacular sight. The so-called thirty li "Fragrant Snow Sea" of Tangqi, with one plum tree every five steps and fragrance ten miles away, has captivated many poets and literati, and intoxicated countless flower lovers! This year, I happened to arrive during the peak season of the flowers, so even though the weather was gloomy, many tourists still came from afar to welcome the spring with joyful hearts. After enduring the long winter, even a gloomy spring is lovely. The car drove directly to the hilly area of ​​Chaoshan, where we were greeted by a group of innocent and rustic children, who were all small guides, smiling because they could earn money. According to them, each person can earn three to five thousand yuan a day. In the mountain village, this is not a small income. In fact, the scenery of Chaoshan is very simple, and you can find it yourself without a guide. As soon as you get out of the car, the fragrance comes with the breeze, and in front of you is a sea of ​​fragrant snow—to be precise, it should be a "Fragrant Snow Lake." The national beauty and clear fragrance are revealed before your eyes, and you will naturally follow the fragrance. In this charming "Fragrant Snow Lake," the Song Plum Pavilion stands solemnly, like an island, like a lake reef. Standing in the Song Plum Pavilion, you can not only look around and carefully admire the flowers, but also see the ancient Song Plum, vigorous and powerful, in front of the pavilion. It has survived many vicissitudes and is still growing strong. Although there is now artificial protection, it still thrives and blossoms, not inferior to its younger peers. This spirit is precisely the founding spirit of the Chinese nation. Seeing the Song Plum, I love our national flower even more. From the Song Plum Pavilion, you reach Bao Ci Temple, a place for tourists to rest and one of the famous scenic spots of Chaoshan. There is a Guanyin Hall in the temple, very small and simple, but it preserves precious antiques: a stone carving of Guanyin statue painted by Wu Daozi, a great painter of the Tang Dynasty, with the famous couplet titled by Yu Quyuan hanging on the left and right: "Buddha stone does not grind Tang ink, immortal plum still occupies Song years." In front of the hall, there is an ancient Tang plum tree, vigorous and full of life, seemingly younger than the Song plum, so many people say it is fake. In addition to the Tang plum, there are also lush cypress trees, blooming winter sweet, and a rare and beautiful green, vine-clustered plum, refreshing and unforgettable. Mr. Huang Yanpei also came to Chaoshan to watch the plum blossoms a few days ago and wrote a poem for the monks of the temple: "I once saw the ancient Tang plum in Santai, and only came to Chaoshan after knowing it for a long time; the clear sky is about to dazzle a piece of snow, the single trunk is old and the flowers are still blooming. This mountain is suitable for plums, especially the people in the mountains are spared from freezing; one or two have survived for eight or nine hundred years, making tourists think of Zhao Song. The Tang Plum and Song Plum are rare, and the six petals are not in the shape, this flower is ancient and full of mulberry sea, and now the sound of gold is noisy outside the mountain."

To the left of Bao Ci Temple is the tomb of the famous painter Wu Changshuo, with a stone statue of Wu next to the tomb, and a stele in front of it engraved with "Portrait of Wu Changshuo teaching arts," simple and elegant. Going up the mountain from Bao Ci Temple, there are two more temples, located on the top of the mountain, with a beautiful environment, but there are no more flowers. Along the way, however, there are three or two clumps here and there, with clear fragrance overflowing everywhere. Going seven or eight li from Chaoshan, there is the Long Cave. At this point, looking out from above, the so-called thirty-li sea of ​​fragrant snow is presented before you. As the breeze rises, the fragrance surges, indeed with the magnificence and vastness of the sea. Being in it, you directly suspect that you are in heaven and do not want to return to the "paradise" on earth——Hangzhou. Tourists love flowers, but mountain farmers love fruit; people who live in nature all day long do not value the beauty of nature but only value the products of nature and utilize its functions. They are only happy when the fruit trees bloom and bear fruit. Bringing hundreds or thousands of dan of fruit from the waterway to other villages brings back the wealth of Tangqi. Tangqi was indeed a prosperous and happy water village before the war, but the suffering war exhausted the wealth of Tangqi. Today, the houses in Tangqi Town are still so crowded, and people travel by boat, and it is not necessary to bring umbrellas and wear raincoats when going to the street on rainy days; but this is only the appearance. The emptiness and suffering inside cannot be seen for a while, but there is one thing that can be seen clearly: before the war, there were five edge factories in Tangqi, and now only Chongyu remains; even this one relies on loans from the Agricultural Bank of China to maintain itself, and the output for export has greatly declined. As for the domestically sold fruits, one of the famous products, the loquat, will have a much smaller harvest this year due to the impact of the weather, and the farmers are suffering for this. What about the merchants? They also have their troubles, the most pressing of which is the housing problem. Shi Ziwen, the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, told the reporter that most of the four hundred shops in Tangqi are rented, and there are only five or six landlords. These landlords are very ruthless, charging three dan of white rice per month for the rent of each shop, and five or six dan per month for two shops. If they do not pay as required, they will "take it back for their own use." Taking advantage of the housing shortage, the landlords want to exploit the merchants, so they formed a joint chamber of commerce to deal with the landlords together, in order to obtain reasonable living conditions. This matter, like thousands of housing disputes, is closely tied to the hearts of millions of people. They hope that the government should uphold justice for the majority of tenants in this regard. The blooming plum blossoms first brought the news of spring, and the spring in Tangqi—this fruit village—is very enviable; but the people in Tangqi not only hope that the plum blossoms bring spring, but they also hope that spring will bring the wealth of Tangqi—a bumper harvest of fruit and reasonable living conditions, in order to restore their vitality. They sent away the winter with smiles, and now they welcome the spring with the same smiles. (This newspaper reporter Huang Xingtian)

### Ode to Mahatma Gandhi; Continued from the Second Paragraph of the Previous Article

Eighth Chapter: Holy

Ninth Chapter: Dedication to All Sentient Beings

Heaven creates earth. Each inch of land produces everything for the present.

Mahatma sacrifices his life to save the world, without anger or resentment.

He gives to the poor and ultimately reaches the other shore.

He fearlessly bestows virtue, his body enduring strength, his spirit shining.

With meditation and wisdom, he emits light. His body is gone, but his path should be followed greatly.

His clear virtue will return to the most good heaven.

I wish to dedicate this light and dispel the darkness, illuminating all directions.

In the middle of the lunar month of the year of the Republic of China, I, an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi, earnestly prayed for the unity of the Indian people.

To achieve a pure city, his prayers and efforts are countless and rapid.

Nehru and other students prayed in place of me.

I beg the Mahatma for compassion for all.

In the middle of the night, he was suddenly murdered, ending his life.

Alas! Mankind is crazy and loses its true nature.

I feel the deep pain. My knowledge of ancient and modern India is at least related to Buddhism.

Using the scriptures and words of both as a metaphor,

Once the defilements are broken, the Buddha-nature flows.

The soldiers repent for harming the Buddha.

This causes the six senses to reflect and harmonize.

Because of his faith and dedication, his life is not insignificant.

His strength will move others to eternity.

One mind is born from one body, awakening one's intellect and wisdom.

Now his good deeds can be changed and corrected.

It is the knowledge of good that is innate.

He will not stop unless his actions are the same.

He will not destroy his virtue with ignorance, his power to illuminate virtue and reform the people.

And looking at the past ten years, the madness of Germany and Italy has its root in greed.

The fire of ignorance destroyed human civilization.

The result is the creation of a unique example of virtue.

In ancient and modern times, without exceptions, only those with virtue can subdue desire.

The evil consequences of harming others will never be spared.

Turning back is the path; serving people is the difference.

Reverence and dedication to religion, if there is no love, there is no faith or action.

Those who do not know and do not believe in the words of the saints.

Give your hands to the country.

The final words and entrustment are the same as the intent of not stealing from the people.

If people can strive to emulate it in reforming their minds and education, they will surely be able to develop the great qualities of diligence, thrift, patience, and a lifestyle that uses modern machines without being tempted or enslaved by them.

Written in Nanjing in the early spring of the year of the Republic of China.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Education stated: Since the post-war recovery, many people in various regions have been preparing to establish private schools.

Players like Li Zhenzhong, Cai Lianke, Cai Wenhua, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, Cai Wenzhang, Chen Xuechong, Tu Wenlong, Ren Xiangcheng, and Cai Zhongqiang are all known for their superb individual skills. Hualian and Dagong each have their own strengths. This time's mixture is truly what is called "two difficulties combined, two beauties possessed." It is no less than the representative team for the city in the upcoming National Games. The cooperation of the two basketball giants is a rare event. Tonight's goal is to use the match against the Marines as the first shot of the expedition, which is indeed an excellent object for testing strength and connection. There will be a wonderful performance at that time. The Marines basketball team came to Shanghai on an expedition from Qingdao. They were defeated by Qingbai, Hualian, and Dagong one after another, but the team's performance has been improving day by day and has been unanimously praised by people in the circle.

### Shortage of Chips in the Market, Competing Advances by Merchant Groups, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Continue to Rise Sharply, 42-count Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Rises Another 5 Million

Yesterday's cotton yarn market, due to the limited allocation of yarn by the Spinning and Construction Company on the previous day, the chips were insufficient to meet demand. Merchant groups from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions remained keen on buying. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn, replicating manufacturers took advantage of the low prices to absorb it, still strong, the price soared to 130 million yuan. By the close of the market, it returned to 127 million yuan, a further increase of 5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Jincheng and Shuiyue also rose by about 6 million yuan. Only Blue Phoenix in 40-count yarn rose by 5 million, while others remained stable. The prices of 32-count yarn were mixed.

21-count Double Horse yarn, the Guangdong merchants' shipping costs are about to be adjusted, and due to shipping schedules, the absorption power is very strong. They bought as soon as there was a sale, and the price soared to a new high of 78.5 million yuan, then rose another 4 million yuan, and the warehouse receipts also showed an increase of about 4 million yuan. 16-count coarse yarn was sluggish due to slow sales, and the market showed oversupply, with prices generally falling by 800,000 to 2 million yuan.

In the cotton cloth market, due to the soaring prices of cotton yarn, and the cost of shipping and handling for merchants increased more than double, although the market was in reverse with the inland, merchants from the north and Guangdong-Hankou all adhered to the principle of holding goods and rushed to export. Cloth merchants on this street, due to the lack of chips, also competed to buy. The price of Longtou fine cloth has been raised all the way to 2.8 million yuan. Subsequently, retail investors who made profits took the opportunity to sell, and the price returned to 2.77 million yuan, a further increase of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other fine cloths also rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan.

Sijunzi serge was in high demand from all parties, soaring to 2.69 million yuan, but after the China Textile Company opened for sale, the price immediately fell back, closing at 2.65 million yuan, resulting in the same increase of 80,000 yuan as Jinlian Miaowu. In addition, Zhigong bleached cloth, fine twill, and plain cloth, high-end Shilin cloth, etc., all remained strong.

Spinning and Construction Sells Yarn

### Importers and Exporters Association Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Customs Penalties and Arrival Issues

[Reported by This Newspaper] It is reported that recently, the Jianghai Customs has issued hundreds of penalty notices, based on Announcement No. 187 of the Jianghai Customs, imposing penalties for goods that have arrived in Shanghai but have not been declared, declaring them confiscated. It is heard that this penalty is quite different from the original announcement. The Importers and Exporters Association of this city has repeatedly received reports from its members, and held a temporary emergency meeting the night before last. The meeting was attended by Shou Jingwei, Zhang Yaozhang, Hua Hongtao, Chen Maoxun, Pu Liangchou, Li Huaqing, Ma Zhongda, and others, who studied the matter in detail by points. It was considered that this penalty by the Jianghai Customs was probably due to the failure to review the laws and regulations, and the inability of various departments to communicate with each other. It was unanimously resolved to send representatives to argue with the Customs reasonably and request the prompt revocation of this illegal penalty.

### Restrict Speculative Factories, New Factories Should Be Temporarily Suspended

In order to restrict the establishment of speculative factories, the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has drafted audit measures and submitted them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review. It is learned that the office has received instructions, which are as follows: (1) It is indeed necessary to restrict speculative factories. The proposed three requirements for new factory applications (a. Equipment with the latest machinery, b. Coordination with new technical training, c. Production of high-quality finished products related to national defense and people's livelihood) are feasible. However, existing factories should also be subject to these requirements, and the establishment of new factories should be temporarily suspended.

(2) In the future, when factories apply for redistribution, they should be ordered to submit authentic documents of the finished products made from the obtained raw materials for review.

(3) Quota allocation was originally a temporary measure adopted due to insufficient foreign exchange. Since the government has such measures, it should continue to effectively control the prices of finished products so that the selling prices of finished products with low raw material prices are not too high, and the price difference between raw materials and finished products is avoided. In this way, the flow of raw materials into the black market can be eradicated from the root. Appropriate measures should be drafted and submitted for review.

### Artificial Silk Recovers, Silk Goods Continue to Rise

The artificial silk market first weakened and then rose yesterday, finally rising by 4 million yuan compared to the previous day. 120-count Xu-character and Jin Sanma bright silk opened at 44 million yuan in the morning, but due to the high price of factory silk, confidence gradually increased, and the market closed at 50 million yuan at noon. The maximum price in the afternoon was 2 million yuan, and the market closed at 1 million yuan.

Factory warp made further progress yesterday. Two orders for C-grade were transacted at a price of 80 million yuan. High less-than-truckload sold for 76.7 million yuan, and medium-grade less-than-truckload sold for 4.5 million yuan, with a total of more than ten packages traded. The quoted prices for other grades were all about 8 million yuan higher than the previous day. Special high-grade less-than-truckload warp had two loads transacted yesterday, with prices reaching as high as 50 million yuan.

The silk goods market continued to rise yesterday. Huaqiang real silk quilt covers reached a maximum price of 4 million yuan immediately, and the market closed at 2.4 million yuan, a large increase of 2.4 million yuan compared to the previous day. Dachang plaid crepe had a maximum price of 97,000 yuan, and the market closed at 94,000 yuan, an increase of 6,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other goods also showed slight increases yesterday.

### Affected by Transportation Price Hikes, Rice Prices Also Rise

The rice market opened strong yesterday morning, but the market slightly recovered later. Due to news that both road and water transportation will increase from today, the cost is increased, and due to the high tin prices the day before, merchants tried their best to raise prices. The prices in the morning market had increased by 150,000 yuan. However, household rice has begun to be sold, and sales on this street are quite sluggish, and the market turnover has also been affected. Moreover, there were more arrivals yesterday, with a total of 11,271 shi in the north and south markets, making it difficult to support, and the market immediately declined midway. The specially high-grade japonica rice in the North Market once shouted up to 3 million, and the market closed at 3 million. White japonica was 2.9 million. Bo rice in the South Market was 2.85 million, and in the North Market was 2.9 million, each up 100,000 yuan. Wuhu machine-milled xian was 2.65 million, and white yuan in the North Market reached 3 million.

Flour Continues to Rise

Flour prices rose due to the rise in rice prices, high prices in the inland, and the fact that factories opened less often. Lao Che flour opened at 1.34 million, and the later market was 1.33 million. Bingchuan opened at 1.33 million, and later was 1.32 million, each up 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. The transactions of Hongfeng and Jiancheng were relatively lively, probably because Hongfeng and Jiancheng had more ball transactions. The prices of both were also 40,000 to 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Bran was in a flat and weak state because the factory opened a lot on the previous day, and wheat remained at 1.85 million.

Coarse Grains Hover

There were no large fluctuations in the prices of coarse grains. The selling and buying parties in the morning opening of soybeans were reluctant to give in. One wanted to rise and sell, and the other wanted to lower and buy. As a result, the price was similar to the previous day. Hankou Zha soybeans were 1.5 million to 1.55 million, and 1.45 million. Green beans and corn slightly rose by 50,000 yuan, and red sorghum was slightly higher by 50,000 yuan. Sesame and white sesame sales were sluggish. Hankou white sesame opened at 3.08 million, down slightly by 20,000 yuan, while milk sesame and yellow sesame rose by 50,000 to 70,000 yuan. Yuan sesame has been suppressed for a long time. Yesterday, the market jumped sharply by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Jian Qing rose by 100,000 yuan, and Xieqiao Jian Qing was 1.55 million yuan. There were advances by the Fujian gang, and raw kernels rose by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan.

Edible Oil Soars

Edible oil finally saw a price increase of 200,000 yuan. Soybean oil was actively traded. Dayou soybean oil opened at 6.08 million in the early market. Sales on this street were very good, and retail investors successively entered, gradually increasing, to a final price of 6.2 million yuan. Da You Xin and Da You Yu both closed at 6.2 million yuan. Rapeseed oil opened at 5.92 million in the initial market, and the final price of returning goods was as high as 6.04 million yuan. Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil opened at 7.12 million, and finally rose to 7.2 million yuan. Other Jiangbei and Chongqing raw oils were also made, each rising by about 200,000 yuan. Ji barrel small cart sesame oil was 6.9 million yuan, and soybean cake was in a flat state.

### Construction Materials Sell Well, Bricks, Tiles, Sand, and Gravel Soar

Among the construction materials, the prices of bricks, tiles, sand, and gravel have soared due to the increase in the cost of living, the high labor costs in the production area, the development of sales in the spring season, the insufficient arrivals, and the thin inventory.

Qingzu bricks have risen to 45 million yuan per 10,000, a huge increase of 12 million compared to the beginning of the week. Qing bricks are priced at 30 million yuan, up 7 million. Yellow bricks are 22 million yuan, Qing tiles are 21 million yuan, machine-made red bricks are 60 million yuan, machine-made red tiles are 43 million yuan per thousand, and clay red tiles are 32 million yuan.

Yellow sand has also risen to 1 million yuan per ton, and gravel is 1.2 million yuan. The prices of various goods have soared from 10% to 30-40%. However, lime and cement are still stable, but the base price has also become firm.

### Exported Raw Materials Can Be Imported Independently, Export Management Committee Convenes Various Industries for Consultation

In order to increase the export of goods and earn foreign exchange, the Export Management Committee has decided to allow manufacturers to import the raw materials needed for exported goods independently, and has formulated measures for the import of raw materials for exported manufactured goods, which have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan. The committee considers that the imported raw materials needed by various industries are extremely numerous. In order to understand the actual situation needed by various industries, it has invited various industries to consult separately, starting on the 23rd of last month. The number of units invited reached as many as 32 industries, and meetings were held with representatives of one or two industries every day. During the meeting, the export volume of each industry, the quantity of raw materials needed from abroad, and the amount of foreign exchange that the manufactured goods can be exchanged for were all presented one by one. The committee will then review and handle the information based on the results of the consultation.

The industries that the committee has convened for consultation, as of the 4th, include shirts, undershirts, socks, bedsheets, towels, handkerchiefs, clothing, water bottles, enamel, steel, electrical appliances, bakelite, yarn tubes, wool weaving, silk weaving, wood yarn, rubber, raincoats, and other 18 industries. From today (5th), buttons, food, glass, seasoning powder, umbrellas, rattan and willow ware, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, needles, canning, stone powder, silk scenery, mirrors, and other 14 industries will continue to hold meetings.

According to the person in charge of the committee, the import of these raw materials is outside the quota for the fourth and fifth quarters. Manufacturers of all exported manufactured goods can apply to import the raw materials they need, and the Central Bank will provide foreign exchange. Those whose total value of raw materials requested for import does not exceed 40% of the total export value of their manufactured goods can be approved first. If it exceeds 40%, they can apply on a case-by-case basis. This measure is also a trial of the chain system, but it is different from the general import and export chain. In the current period of foreign exchange shortage, the government is doing everything possible to increase the import of raw materials for various manufacturers, which is truly a painstaking effort. It is hoped that the manufacturers of various exporting industries will cooperate with the government.

### Taiwan Sugar Recovers

Yesterday, the tenth phase of Taiwan Sugar's distribution was carried out as usual, with the same allocation price as before, but the package amount was based on the eighth phase, with 120 groups of special cotton white totaling 15,175 packages, and 180 groups of No. 2 sand white totaling 10,540 packages, a decrease compared to the ninth phase. The Taiwan dollar also increased by 3 yuan, to 145 yuan, so the market sentiment improved, and it recovered.

The association's distribution, spot 24 coarse white initially opened at 3.6 million yuan, then rose by 850,000 to 880,000 yuan. Four half-white from 3.85 million yuan to 4 million yuan. 20 medium sand white from 3.12 million yuan to 3.3 million yuan, up 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

Warehouse receipt transactions fluctuated more. The eighth phase of medium sand white rose by 50,000 yuan, the ninth phase of coarse white rose by more than 100,000 yuan, and the tenth phase of medium sand white fluctuated by more than 200,000 yuan before and after. And four half-white initially opened at 880,000 yuan, then slightly softened, and finally recovered upward, reaching more than 1 million yuan.

Local sugar also stabilized, but the increase was limited. Shantou Qing was 2.4 million yuan to 2.37 million yuan, Mian Chi was 2.47 million yuan to 2.5 million yuan, Xing Chi was 2.44 million yuan to 2.4 million yuan, and the second grade was 2.28 million yuan. Diao Qing was 2.34 million yuan, and Shunde Qing was the same price, with a total of more than 1,000 packages opened.

### Taiwan Sugar Company Sells Sugar, Quota of Approximately 2,000 Tons

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Taiwan Sugar Company sold sugar as usual yesterday, distributing approximately 2,000 tons based on the eighth phase of sugar distribution this year. Two types of sugar were distributed: one was special grade cotton white, with an allocation price of 2.65 million yuan, and the other was No. 2 sand white, with an allocation price of 2.4 million yuan.

### Flourishing Trading of Chinese Stocks, Yong Yarn Continues to Rise

Chinese stocks experienced a period of transfer yesterday, and shifted their ground outside the market. Trading was exciting, and those in the industry still showed strong buying interest. Yong Yarn continued its upward trend, but miscellaneous stocks paled in comparison, and the strong momentum gradually weakened at the end.

The morning opening was slightly sluggish due to tight monetary conditions. Yong Yarn entered the market at prices of 1160 yuan and 1210 yuan. After opening, No. 179 and others immediately traded for immediate delivery, with Yong Yarn immediate delivery first seeing a low of 1158 yuan. However, No. 224 and others aggressively raised prices for deferred delivery, and No. 197 and others absorbed for immediate delivery, rising to 1177 yuan and 1243 yuan. No. 145 and others sold for immediate delivery, No. 117 and others sold for deferred delivery. The outside market interest rate opened high at 2.85 and 3.3, and those with margin accounts who were unable to secure goods were forced down to 1148 yuan and 1223 yuan. The premium for current advances continued to widen, but the major players in the industry remained firm in their intentions, continuously absorbing. External stocks were also stimulated, with No. 232 and others advancing, and No. 36 and others advancing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. China Xing and China Silk hit the limit up. Yong Yarn rose to high prices of 1110 yuan and 1290 yuan, with No. 141 and others selling for deferred delivery, and No. 95 and others selling for immediate delivery, near noon dropping to within 1180 yuan and 1270 yuan. No. 224 and others strongly supported the price, and No. 226 and others absorbed for immediate delivery, with the noon closing at 1195 yuan and 1280 yuan. Compared to the previous close, immediate delivery stocks were among those hitting the limit up. After hitting the limit up, China Silk saw some retracement, surging by 10%. China Textile, Rongfeng, Business, and Yonggong rose by 5%, Hengfeng and Anshang remained flat, and the rest saw slight increases. Deferred delivery stocks, due to the premium, each rose by 10% to 15%.

In the afternoon, Yong Yarn started from 1210 yuan and 1290 yuan, with No. 65 and others selling for deferred delivery, and No. 35 and others selling for immediate delivery, retreating to 1195 yuan and 1275 yuan. No. 218 and others were still buying and there was demand, while No. 13 and others were selling for deferred delivery, and No. 157 and others were also selling for immediate delivery, falling to 1180 yuan and 1248 yuan. No. 13 and others were advancing on deferred delivery, and No. 160 and others were advancing on deferred delivery, with China Xing hitting the limit up and rising to new high prices of 1225 yuan and 1293 yuan. No. 103 and others were selling for immediate delivery, and No. 104 advanced and then sold. The National Bank made very few advances. Although there was a retracement, there was still demand. No. 183 and others sold for deferred delivery, and the closing price was 280 yuan and 1257 yuan. As a result of the after-hours balance count, China Xing immediate delivery shares remained at the limit, Hengfeng rose by 5%, China Textile, Tongyi, and Qinxing remained flat, underwear saw a slight increase, China-France Yonggong fell by 5%, and the rest saw slight declines. In the outside market, unlisted stocks in banks, culture, public utilities, and Dasheng rose again by 5% to 10%.

Arbitrage trading was very lively yesterday due to the change in direction outside the market, and premiums also rose in tandem. Interest rates for advance-settlement ranged from 2.3 to 2.78 fen per month. For on-board arbitrage, it could reach over 3 jiao. Regarding premium, Yong Yarn opened at 70 yuan, rising from 67 yuan to 80 yuan, with the noon close at 78 yuan. Xinhe ranged from 30 yuan to 32 yuan, and Meiya opened at the highest price of 180 yuan, falling to 160 yuan, with the closing price at 170 yuan. Small stocks were around 8 yuan.

### Stable Government Bonds, Rising Foreign Stocks

Government bonds were very stable yesterday. Unified Grade C opened at 90,000 yuan, which was already a low price. Midway through, it rose to 96,000, and then leveled off slightly. Dachengxing and Rooms 550 and 503 bought in, while Rooms 360, 552, and 500 sold. Compared to the previous close, Unified Grade C rose by 4,000 yuan, and miscellaneous bonds all rose by 3,000 yuan, with a turnover of approximately 2 million.

Foreign stocks still showed signs of tension yesterday. The steel industry suddenly encountered a large number of speculators scrambling to buy, and supply could not meet demand, resulting in price increases. The paper industry was helpful, with both Guangdong merchants and foreign merchants buying. Yisha opened in the morning at 1.23 million, with the high price approaching 1.3 million, and then leveled off slightly. As a result of the comparison with the previous closing, paper industry stocks rose, steel industry stocks rose by 20%, shipping industry stocks rose by 10%, and the rest rose by 5%.

### Interest Rates on Special Fund Deposits Increased Across the Board Weekly

It was recently learned from the National Bank's Treasury Bureau that regarding the interest rates on special fund deposit accounts, except for those that do not accrue interest, those originally paying 8 li per week will be uniformly increased to 1.2 fen per week, calculated from December 21, 1947.

### Strong Demand for Export Tea

Since domestic tea has been continuously sought after by buyers, yesterday in the market, due to the continuous shipments from this street to Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places, inquiries were still quite enthusiastic, and the process remained unabated. As for the foreign tea market, negotiations were also very frequent, and people's sentiments were generally stable, with a tendency for black tea to remain firm and green tea to advance rapidly. The reason for this is that the former has balanced imports and exports with little change, while the latter has empty inventories, with holders seeking higher prices, leading to a rapid increase in price.

According to industry sources, it was recently learned that exporters in this city suddenly received a telegram from North Africa requesting the purchase of over 500 boxes of green tea, mostly Ping Shui Pearl Tea and Tunxi Zhenmei. Unfortunately, the supply of these goods is about to run out, and there is a tendency for supply to be insufficient. Looking ahead, the situation is likely to become even more acute.

### Spring Seeds Insufficient Supply, Only Over One Million Sheets Cultivated in Four Provinces

According to relevant sources, the output of silkworm seeds from various seed production farms for both the spring and autumn seasons of 1947 failed to meet the projected targets. The situation was similar in various farms in Sichuan Province. The mulberry gardens of the Yunnan Provincial Sericulture New Village Company are large in scale and well-equipped, but the silkworm seeds produced last year and transported to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for distribution were damaged en route, and this year's seed production was also reduced, resulting in a tendency for the spring seeds this year to be insufficient in supply.

In order to utilize the superior equipment of the New Village Company to solve the problem of silkworm seed supply in the future, the silkworm seed industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has cooperated with the New Village Company to cultivate silkworms and produce seeds. After a trial run in the autumn of 1947, it is planned to increase or decrease the production amount annually based on actual needs. The production volume of silkworm seeds in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Yunnan last autumn and this spring is recorded below:

Seeds used in the autumn of 1947: Jiangsu and Zhejiang: 557,415 (sheets). Sichuan: 325,000. Yunnan: 16,000. Total: 898,415. Seeds used in the spring of 1948: Jiangsu and Zhejiang: 1,086,239 (sheets). Sichuan: 145,000. Yunnan: 140,000.

### Stable Cigarettes

Yesterday, the cigarette market saw brisk trading due to healthy demand from all parties, and prices were also firm. Later, near the close, due to the notification of goods allocation from cigarette companies such as Sino-American, Xingkang, Huamei, etc., the spot market supply suddenly became abundant, and the financial conditions of those in the industry tightened, leading to a surge in selling pressure in the market, and prices stopped rising and turned weak. However, as a result, ten-stick packs of Great Britain Old Knife cigarettes still saw an increase of 1.55 million to 1.6 million yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, American goods and canned cigarettes rose by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, while Chinese merchant cigarettes saw mixed increases and decreases.

### Rising Industrial Raw Materials

Among industrial raw materials, caustic soda and beeswax saw continuous price increases due to strong demand from soap and candle manufacturers. Monthly brand caustic soda rose to 89 million yuan per barrel, and American goods rose to 87 million yuan per barrel. The price of soda ash also rose sharply, with monthly brands reaching as high as 8 million yuan. Beeswax rose to 8.5 million yuan per picul. Other various types of products such as Trigonal brand glycerine, baking soda, bleaching powder essence, etc., saw an average daily increase of 10% to 20%.

### The Drinking Water Problem of Shanghai Residents

— Canglong

Everyone knows that water is necessary for life, but they don't know that water is the most important thing for maintaining our lives. Let's take those who fast as an example. Some people in India can fast for 49 days, but they cannot go without drinking water for even one day. Let's also take animals for an experiment. If we remove 20% of the total water content in an animal's body, then this animal will die due to insufficient water. From this reasoning, it can be seen how important water is to life.

Thank Heaven for bringing us from the inland to this Shanghai area with tap water! Thanks to the British, who installed tap water facilities in Shanghai, which was previously known as a semi-colony, allowing us to fortunately drink this clean water. This is definitely not an overstatement! If we travel to the inland once, we will see that in places where there is water, people are washing toilets on one side and drawing water for cooking on the other. As for water-scarce areas in the Northwest, the water problem is even more unimaginable. Therefore, we should be proud of being able to enjoy tap water in Shanghai.

Unfortunately, this proud enjoyment of ours has not lasted for very long. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the tap water in Shanghai has gradually deteriorated. At first, the amount of water was insufficient, and later it was no longer tap water. When we take a bath, we often find many red threadworms in the bathtub. As for the turbidity of the color and the increase in sediment, that goes without saying. At that time, we certainly felt uncomfortable and hoped to be able to drink the clean tap water from before again. However, under enemy control, we could only hope for the dawn.

And now the dawn has come, and it has been more than two years since the dawn. Can we regain the enjoyment from before? I cannot say, I dare not say. I can only tell everyone one sentence: "Every time I drink salty boiled water or salty tea that doesn't taste like tea, I can only sigh and shake my head."

Of course, some people will ask me, "Why has the tap water deteriorated?" "Is it because the salty Huangpu River water has seeped into the tap water?" "Is it because the tap water's sand filtration work is not thorough enough?" "Is it..." These questions are what all Shanghai residents want to know. But, I cannot say, I dare not say.

I have already said above that water is the most important thing for maintaining human life, so tap water, which is related to the lives of millions of people in Shanghai, is of course very important. Therefore, the municipal authorities should comprehensively plan and properly solve "the problem of the supply of the entire amount of water," "the problem of the composition of the water," "the problem of the inspection of the water," "the problem of the clarification of the water," "the problem of the filtration of the water," and "the problem of the disinfection of the water," etc.

I remember that in 1884, cholera bacteria accidentally seeped into the tap water pipes in Hamburg, Germany, resulting in the Hamburg plague (with more than 100,000 deaths), which shocked the world. Now it is the time when winter is passing and spring is coming, everything is sprouting, and all bacteria are waiting for an opportunity to move. I now hope that the city authorities will quickly review and improve the tap water problem, which is related to the safety of the lives of millions of city residents, so as to avoid causing an irreparable disaster in the future. In that case, it wouldn't matter if I drank more salty water or salty tea.

### A Casual Discussion on Asthma and its Treatment

— Liang Junqing

When we see patients, we often encounter those who come to request treatment for asthma. In fact, asthma itself is a symptom of various diseases, and does not refer to a specific disease. For example, people with heart disease can have asthma, people with nervous bronchial asthma can also have asthma, and people with nephritis or diabetes can also develop asthma in certain situations. In addition, conditions such as nervous disorders and pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary edema, etc., often have asthma symptoms. Therefore, we must investigate the root cause of asthma and carefully examine the source of the disease beforehand, so that we can determine whether the disease has a chance of recovery and prescribe the right medicine for the symptoms. However, in terms of the frequency of illness, nervous bronchial asthma is the most likely to occur, the most frequently found, and the most painful of all asthma diseases. Therefore, this article is specifically written as a compass for such patients.

As the name suggests, the nervous bronchial asthma mentioned in this article (Western name Asthmabranchiale) is of course a type of bronchial asthma related to nerve function. This is because its symptoms during an attack are entirely a sudden, episodic bronchospasm phenomenon controlled by nerves (when the disease is not attacking, the patient is no different from a normal person). The chest cavity is in an inhalation state, and the action of exhaling air is very difficult. When exhaling air, the bronchial mucosa and the smallest bronchiolar mucosa are in a state of redness and swelling, secreting a large amount of mucus. This mucus must be discharged with great difficulty with the aid of the contraction of the bronchiolar wall muscles. According to clinical investigations, 90% of patients belong to allergic diseases, and asthma occurs immediately when an allergic reaction occurs to a certain substance. It can also occur in a state of bad mood or emotional excitement, and it is especially easy to suffer when the tenth cranial nerve (i.e., the vagus nerve) becomes diseased.

Causes

Although patients with this disease are not limited to age and gender, from a clinical statistical point of view, children are the most common patients. Among children, it is most common between the ages of two and four. This is because the cause of this disease is mostly due to nervous allergic reactions. Children are not born for a long time, and are prone to allergic reactions to external substances. Moreover, children's physical qualities are largely inherited from their parents, and once they encounter qualities that are contrary to those transmitted by their parents, it is easy to have antagonistic allergic reactions. As for external substances that can stimulate patients to develop asthma, there are many types of allergens, such as certain dusts, certain air, certain climates, certain proteins, certain foods, and certain drugs, numbering dozens that cannot be fully listed for the time being. The Belgian scholar Stormvan Leerwen has done great research on this. The German Saxon Serum Factory once had an injectable substance for testing asthma. If it can be determined which of these dozens of allergens is the cause of asthma, then the treatment problem will be easily solved in the future, and the method is perfect. Unfortunately, although this method is very effective, it is sometimes ineffective. In the end, it cannot be said to be perfect. Recently, someone examined the urine of asthma patients during an asthma attack and found that there were many endocrines similar to proteins, and the tests were consistently accurate. As a result, many scholars believe that asthma is related to the endocrine system and advocate treating it with endocrines. This method is of course more novel and reasonable in principle, but it is still in the experimental stage and has not dared to be made public to sway public opinion.

Symptoms

Patients with this disease often have had several different kinds of symptoms in their previous medical history, such as frequent eczema in both ears, and frequent eczema on the face and limbs. Any part of the skin that was originally healthy as usual will immediately become red, swollen, and inflamed after being scratched, or even develop vesicles that secrete liquid. This type of patient is more likely to develop asthma in the future.

This disease usually occurs at night, or it can occur during the day and worsen at night. At the beginning, there may be coughing or immediate asthma, it is very difficult to exhale air, making a wheezing sound, and when inhaling air, the chest expands, and the ribs lengthen and become clearly visible like a patient with rickets. The muscles and blood vessels in the neck are in a sunken spasmodic state. If examined with a stethoscope, there are flute sounds and bubbling sounds everywhere in the chest. This phenomenon is very obvious, and once observed, it can be remembered forever and cannot be forgotten. As for the duration of this episodic symptom, it generally lasts for a day or two before it subsides and becomes a mild cough, and gradually returns to normal. At this time, if the patient has completely recovered, he is no different from a normal person, and it is impossible to recognize the embarrassing state he was in when the disease attacked.

We often read in textbooks that "the white blood cells of asthma patients often have increased eosinophils (Eosinophilie) and the sputum contains Curschmann spirals and Leyden crystals," but in fact, it is just empty talk. In clinical practice, it is often impossible to obtain these results. It is almost true that believing everything in books is worse than having no books.

Treatment methods

As mentioned earlier, most patients with this disease have nervous allergic reactions. Therefore, the treatment of this disease should of course target the cause of the disease. For example, those who develop asthma after eating fish and shrimp must abstain from fishy foods in the future. Also, those who develop asthma when they smell a certain flower fragrance must avoid this pollen in the future. In addition, those who are intolerant of humid weather must move to a place with a high and dry climate. There are too many cases like this to list them all, and you must be able to respond flexibly and draw inferences about other cases from one instance.

Those who treated asthma in the past often liked to use ephedra preparations, Adrenalin, Asthmolysin, etc. These drugs are very effective quickly, but the effect of the drugs also wears off quickly. They are so-called drugs that treat the symptoms but not the root cause. If the attack is very severe, it can be used temporarily to deal with the emergency, but it cannot be used for a long time. Long-term use will not only have little effect, but also promote hardening of the blood vessels.

Among antispasmodics, drugs such as Atropine, Ext. Belladonn Erpado can also help in an emergency, but their side effects are very large, and they should not be tried lightly unless used by a doctor. In addition, sulfur preparations, protein preparations, tuberculin vaccine, Pepton, and endocrines all have therapeutic effects, but they fall within the scope of use by doctors and will not be listed here.

I like to use benzoin inhalant and potassium iodide for asthma patients, and I often get miraculous results, because it can not only resolve phlegm and relieve cough, but also eliminate bronchial spasms. As for calcium preparations and vitamin BC, they are also very helpful in the treatment of this disease. In short, since this disease is a nervous allergic reaction, the treatment method must start from this direction. The various treatment methods mentioned above are all aimed at avoiding the occurrence of allergies. As for the various technical problems in treatment, it depends on the guidance of a specialist doctor.

### Good Medicine During the Treatment of Lung Diseases

— Huang Jun

Although an effective medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis has not yet been invented, pulmonary tuberculosis is not a difficult disease. Wealthy people who discover symptoms early can rest in places with fresh air. Those who discover it late only need to inject air and cut ribs. If they are well taken care of, the percentage of recovery is definitely the majority. The suffering lies in the fact that the general public who have no money have to bear the expenses of the family even when they have lung disease. While still burying their heads in work, they are also worried about the economy, so the hope of recovery is less.

After suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, one will definitely immediately suffer from severe hysteria, depression, suspicion, irritability... all follow one after another. Lin Daiyu, with her thousand beauties, is a typical example in the Dream of the Red Chamber. At that time, patients needed to lie quietly in order to recuperate, so the mess came. They analyzed every extremely simple thing into an extremely complex and tedious matter, and it was often unfavorable to them. For example, if the sister-in-law accidentally winked at the brother, then in bed, they would evolve this matter into something mysterious and profound, and even associate it with the possibility that the two of them might unite the entire family to adopt some policy towards the annoying patient. Sometimes, not only that, but also a terrifying thought would arise out of thin air, stimulating them to shiver. This is partly because their pain stimulates their nerves, and partly because their minds are nowhere to be placed while lying in bed, and hallucinations will naturally emerge one after another. But these hallucinations are often painful and detrimental to the body, so their disease gradually deepens. There are not a few patients with lung disease who even die due to mental breakdown.

However, it is impossible for patients to automatically abandon these hallucinations and seek happiness. If it is to be done, it must be added with great, sacrificial love. But the supply of this point is not enough on the family's side. Because the patient is irritable, they often become cold-hearted, and sometimes even complain to the patient with cold words. They think that with such a comfortable ward, such exquisite food, and expensive needles, medicines, and tonics, the patient should be satisfied, and they themselves seem to have fulfilled their duties. However, this is precisely "losing all one's efforts for lack of one final accomplishment." A sincere person who visits the sick can hear the patient complaining about the family's treatment of him, even to the point of tears.

Love, perhaps it includes maternal love, friendship, and love, etc. Young patients, for example, need love to support their courage to survive. I have a friend who has lung disease. He can't inject air, and his family all advised him to have surgery, but he is a coward and refuses to die. Later, the family was so anxious that they invited his lover to persuade him. The girlfriend said to him very sweetly, "If you have the surgery, I will marry you." My friend agreed immediately without even thinking about it. As for children with lung disease, perhaps they get better faster. On the one hand, because maternal love is great, she takes care of him all day and night. On the other hand, children don't have any thoughts, and they don't know what sorrow is. They can sleep and eat, and the disease will naturally get better faster. The most miserable are the single young people. I have a friend who lives with his brother, and he doesn't even have a sister-in-law. After he developed lung disease, he also developed pleurisy. Later, because the doctor didn't see him properly, it turned into TB pleurisy. He was bedridden for five or six years and still hasn't gotten better. His brother goes to work at noon, and he is so lonely that he doesn't know what to do. He can't work, so he has to keep reading a book. Sometimes when I go to see him, I always feel sorry for him for not finding a girlfriend before he got sick. Now no one denies his mental depression. I estimate that he still has six years of illness to live, but his spirit can only support at most two years.

So, if there are any patients with pulmonary tuberculosis among you, don't forget to find the patient great, sacrificial love. It is just like other needles, medicines, and tonics, it is a vitamin that people with pulmonary tuberculosis cannot lack.

### Medical News

— Cang Long

(1) Vaccination Can Treat Ulcerative Stomatitis

Ulcerative stomatitis can sometimes occur in the mouth, causing not only extreme pain but also being extremely difficult to cure. Many scholars have tried using arsenic preparations, or vitamin C, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, and nicotinic acid, etc., as treatments, but the results have been uncertain, sometimes effective and sometimes not at all. According to a report by Professor Laubert of Switzerland, this type of stomatitis is caused by a filterable viral toxin. If patients are vaccinated, they will recover immediately.

(2) Diabetes Can Accelerate the Deterioration of Pulmonary Tuberculosis

According to a report in last year's British Medical Journal, if diabetes patients are not given appropriate treatment, it is very easy to accelerate the deterioration of their accompanying pulmonary tuberculosis. Therefore, Dr. W.R. Gaud and Dr. A. Lyall strongly advocated in the article that all diabetes patients must have their lungs examined twice a year with X-rays. If patients often have colds, nasal congestion, or chronic pharyngitis and bronchitis, they should also have their sputum or gastric juice tested at any time to prevent the development of pulmonary tuberculosis in secret.

If acute mastitis occurs after childbirth, a large dose of penicillin (100,000 units injected intramuscularly twice a day) and a small dose of ovarian preparations (1mg taken orally three times a day) can be injected, and recovery can be achieved completely within three or four days.

(4) New Method to Prevent Measles

According to a report by Dr. PTatchell of London, in addition to injecting serum from someone who has had measles to prevent the occurrence of measles during a measles epidemic, washing the nasal mucosa with warm boric acid water every day can also have the same effect.

(5) New Method for Treating Persistent Sores

According to a report by Dr. J.A. Wolfer of Chicago, USA, persistent sores are often caused by a deficiency in vitamin C. If a large dose of vitamin C is given, the recovery will be very rapid.

### Small Statistics on National Medical Institutions

— Wang Juerong

The following are the national medical and pharmaceutical education institutions:

National University Affiliated Medical Colleges 15

National Medical Colleges 6

Provincial Medical Colleges 3

Provincial Medical Specialized Schools 5

Private University Affiliated Medical Colleges 6

Private Medical Colleges 7

A total of 42 schools are distributed in 27 cities across the country:

The 42 schools have a total of:

Faculty 1055

Students 10765

An average of 10 to 11 students are taught by each teacher

The distribution density in the 27 cities is as follows:

Shanghai 7 schools, Hangzhou, Beiping, and Guangzhou 3 schools each

Taiyuan, Jinan, Xi'an, and Nanchang 2 schools each

The other 19 cities have 1 school each

Among the 42 schools:

The school with the most students is: National Shenyang Medical College, with 777 students

The school with the most professors is: also "Shen Da", with 164 people

The school with the fewest students is: Private Sino-French University Medical College, with 10 students

The schools with the fewest professors are: Private Sino-French University Medical College and National Zhejiang University Medical College, with 3 people each. The school with the most graduates in 1946 was: Private Tongde Medical College, with 91 people!

The physician output of the 42 schools is:

5119 people in the ten years from 1936 to 1945

976 people in 1946

Total output in eleven years 6095 people

Average annual output 555 people

At this rate of production, to achieve the plan of one physician for every 2,000 people, it will take until at least the 60th year of the Republic of China! This is assuming that the national population does not increase and physicians do not ascend to the heavenly realm!

There are a total of 6 dental schools in the country, distributed in four major cities

The 6 schools have a total of 132 faculty members and 275 students

167 dentists graduated in the ten years from 1936 to 1945

17 graduates in 1946

A total of 184 dentists were produced in eleven years

The average annual production nationwide is only 17 people! That is, one new dentist can be allocated for every 26 million people each year!

There are a total of 11 pharmacy schools in the country, distributed in eight major cities across the country. The 11 schools have a total of 639 students. A total of 713 pharmacists graduated in the eleven years from 1936 to 1946.

The average annual production of pharmacists is 63 people! That is, one new pharmacist is added for every 7 million people each year!

(Note: The above figures are all based on statistics from the Ministry of Education. Due to the haste in writing the manuscript and the fact that it was all done late at night, there may be inaccuracies. Your understanding is appreciated.)

According to the statistics of the delegate quota allocation table of the Second National Federation of Physicians' Associations, the 25 provinces and cities that have established provincial and municipal associations have a total of 17,903 members. Assuming that the other 35 regional provinces and cities that have not established associations have more than 5,000 members, the total number of physicians in the country should not exceed 22,500! This is suitable for one-tenth of the number of physicians that should be available in the five-year plan of the highest authorities! It has been two and a half years since the victory! I don't know if the health and education authorities have paid attention to this?

Physicians are like this, and dentists are even rarer! It is said that the total number of dentists in the country does not exceed 1,500!

There is an average of one dentist for every 300,000 people. If every citizen has their teeth checked once a year, then each dentist must examine 1,000 patients every day, excluding Sundays and holidays. If we calculate eight hours of work, each dentist should examine at least two patients per minute!

If we calculate at a normal rate of half an hour per patient, then a dentist can treat 16 patients per day. If, unfortunately, every citizen suffers from a dental disease once in their lifetime, then 300,000 patients will need another 60 years! In other words, if a seven-year-old child has a dental disease and registers for treatment, they will have to wait until they are 67 years old to be seen! The "wet behind the ears" child has become an old man with "child's face and crane's hair." The patient will never forget the kindness and virtue of this dentist with thriving business! I respectfully ask the delegates of the National Federation of Physicians' Associations to take note of this.

### On the Medical Profession Going to the Countryside (Part 2)

— Xu Jing

Why are doctors concentrated in cities? The answer is that they have no better place to go, so they stay in cities because modern medicine is a part of applied science. New medicine and new drugs are dependent on each other. Most foreign medicines are concentrated and distributed in cities, and medical equipment and hospital facilities rely on electricity and water supply. Remote rural areas not only lack electricity and water supply, but they don't even have a decent house. I came back from Jiawang and Xuzhou and saw houses made of earth all the way. They are like earth kilns with only one hole, which serves as both the door and the window. Don't laugh, that is where most of our compatriots eat, sleep, and take shelter from the wind. Because Jiawang Town has a Huadong Coal Mining Company, there are still some modern buildings, schools, hospitals, and water and electricity supplies, which have already become a small city. However, the lack of sufficient medicines often makes it difficult for doctors. Closed-off customs and traffic obstruction are the greatest enemies of modern civilization, and they are also the greatest enemies of new medicine and new drugs. Some places have not yet been opened up. They would rather believe in witches than ask for doctors, and they would rather believe in gods and monsters than in science. This depends on education to lead the way, and then literacy can be popularized. Some townships have no formal doctors because of this. They are all dominated by quack doctors. They hang up the signs of Western medicine and do shady business; those who know a little about injection techniques hang up advertisements promising a cure with one injection. This not only harms people's lives, but also makes people misunderstand that Western medicine is just that. However, when formal doctors occasionally go to the countryside, they are not accustomed to their tricks. They don't brag or perfunctorily treat patients, but often return empty-handed. It turns out that rural doctors often have to walk dozens of miles to make a house call (take a boat if there is one, or walk if there isn't), and they are not allowed to charge a separate house call fee. The fee includes the medicine fee, and only a total amount is charged. (A doctor told me that house calls in the countryside are different from those in the city. If villagers ask for a doctor, the doctor must go. If the doctor doesn't go, people will criticize him, which will affect his business. After the house call, only a total amount can be charged. If you want to list the items in detail, the villagers will definitely be dissatisfied.) You can ask for as much as you can get. Doctors who don't know how to do this or disdain to do it cannot stand their ground. Therefore, those who succeed in the countryside are not necessarily good doctors, but old hands who know the psychology of the villagers. The so-called countryside here is only limited to the townships along the railway lines. It is still the territory of quack doctors. In other remote areas, I am afraid that there aren't even any half-baked quack doctors.

Doctors in cities are not without intention of going to the countryside. To be honest, even in Shanghai, there are not many doctors who have a fixed income. The rest are only staying in Shanghai because they have no better place to go. On the one hand, it is because there is almost no clean place due to wars everywhere (a friend of mine who works in a hospital in Beiping recently wrote a letter wanting to come to Shanghai). On the other hand, even if they intend to "open a market" (go to the countryside), the difficulties are as described above, so there are many who hesitate to go. This includes education, construction, and transportation problems, which cannot be solved by doctors alone. Thinking of this waste of talent, it is really regrettable.

There are many surplus materials on Fuxing Island that are allowed to rot and be damaged, including a large number of cars, food, and medicine. Some people have already cried out loudly, but no one seems to lament this waste of specialized talent. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in "China's Destiny" that with the vast territory of China, there need to be more than 200,000 doctors to be sufficient for distribution, but how many years of effort does it take to create a doctor? Now the number of doctors is still less than one-tenth of the minimum target, but they are still allowed to rot in the cities!

The low salaries of doctors serving in municipal hospitals are forcing many outstanding talents to leave and become independent, resulting in a dense distribution of private clinics and increasing competition, while hospital performance is only so-so. Recently, Director Zhang of the Municipal Health Bureau intended to resign. The biggest reason is said to be the lack of funding and the low salaries of public officials, which makes it impossible to attract specialized talent, so that many plans cannot be implemented. This is such a contradictory phenomenon! If our society needs specialized talent to build, it should give them special treatment. This will not only allow them to work with peace of mind, but also encourage people and reward talent. In the past, someone wanted to buy a thoroughbred horse, and someone deceived him with a dead horse. The buyer recognized that it was the bone of a thoroughbred horse and paid a high price for it. As a result, countless good horses came to his door. Now, it is the opposite. You want the horse to run, but you don't feed it enough. How can talent not leave!

I have met several colleagues who are very tired of the city and believe that doctors in the city are only serving the wealthy (due to the high cost of medical care, the poor have long been excluded from medical care). If someone can guarantee their livelihood, they are willing to go to the countryside to serve. But the problem now is that there is no such guarantor. For the sake of livelihood, they can only stay in this city that they are so tired of!

### Talking About "Defeatism"

— Wu Yong

To do something well, you must deeply believe that you can do it well. This is a necessary condition for "success." I think this principle is very simple.

The February issue of "Reader's Digest" magazine had an "Excerpt" titled "The Range of Mental Activity," by an author named Rhine. According to the author, the results of scientific experiments prove that the power of the mind can be transmitted and can affect matter. For example, when we throw dice, if we are just throwing them for fun, absent-mindedly, and don't take it seriously, then the number of dice that add up in thousands of throws follows the "law of probability" in mathematics; if we concentrate our energy and wholeheartedly want the dice to add up to a certain number when we throw them, according to the author, the result can change the mathematical "law of probability." This means that in thousands of throws, the number of dice that add up to the number we want can appear more often than the "law of probability" allows; and the frequency is directly proportional to the degree of concentration of the thrower's mind. In this way, the author proves that the power of the mind is enough to control matter.

We cannot determine whether the above statement is correct. However, no matter what we do, we must concentrate our energy, do it wholeheartedly, and deeply believe that it will succeed, and then we will have the hope of success. I think this is a certain principle. The Chinese have always emphasized the word "sincerity," the meaning of which is not simple, but in terms of its meaning in doing things, it is nothing more than doing things with "sincerity" and "earnestness." Most temples have a plaque in front of the gods, which reads: "Sincerity Brings Manifestation." Although this is superstition, if we use it as a motto for governing affairs, change it to "Sincerity Brings Success," I think it is not bad.

Conversely, if we are suspicious in our hearts, and feel that something is on the verge of despair, and that it is probably incurable, then our hearts are empty, our will is shifted, and we cannot talk about efficiency when doing things. It is naturally difficult to achieve success. Dealing with things in this attitude is what is called "lethargy." If an individual is "lethargic," they cannot embark on the "road to light"; if they extinguish the lamp of "self-confidence," how can they see "light"? This is talking about small personal matters; if it is a major event, then the individual's "lethargy" will spread and affect others, affecting the entire society and country.

This kind of lethargy, to put it in an old saying, is "insincerity" and "lack of determination"; in foreign countries, it is called "defeatism." In recent years, our entire society seems to be immersed in "lethargy," which is undeniable. In terms of economics alone, we have heard many "defeatist" arguments in the past year. Some people say: "Only immortals can deal with this situation." Some people say: "Prices will inevitably rise slowly." Still others say: "The price of rice will definitely not be changed again within a month." There are even those who make the following arguments: "After the currency reform in the future, it will take about ten years for the new currency to inflate to the current level." It is unnecessary to say these kinds of words in private; if they come from the mouths of government officials, it is especially inappropriate. Publicly expressing "defeatism" not only does not help the situation but also hinders the overall situation; unintentionally revealing the erroneous idea that "Chinese affairs always go wrong" also has a very significant negative impact on the general public's perception. Why will the price of rice inevitably rise next month? Why will the new currency inflate again after ten years? Leaving aside what will happen next month, how can you predict that the economic situation will be bad after ten years? This simply shows that the speaker has lost confidence in the Chinese nation. These kinds of words are like the cries of crows, symbolizing ominous omens, which are really disgusting to hear. I believe that it is extremely necessary to correct this.

Chinese affairs seem very complicated on the surface, making it difficult to know where to start; but in fact, they must not be completely so. The so-called "calamities" in our country have more "man-made disasters" than "natural disasters." And the so-called "calamities" are by no means as "irreversible" as people generally think. It must be known that the saying "Man will conquer nature" has great truth. It is just that we must hold on to the confidence of "inevitable victory," which is the first step in saving the so-called "calamity." If we are "absent-minded," and adopt the "monk striking the bell" attitude, without intending to do things well, or even intending to mess things up, then it goes without saying that things will not improve.

Secondly, we must be responsible for everything, and not shirk responsibility. It is clearly a "man-made disaster," but it is called a "natural disaster," which is to shirk responsibility. If the situation deteriorates, and it is said that this is due to the entire situation, and that it is impossible for one person or one region to be responsible, this is also to shirk responsibility. There are two theories in philosophy: "objective" and "subjective"; there are also adornments of "environment" and "individual" in society. Those who advocate the "objective theory" say that the "objective" is enough to control the "subjective"; those who advocate the "environmental theory" say that the "environment" is enough to control the "individual." In fact, when the "objective" reaches the end, the "subjective" is the "objective"; when the "environmental theory" reaches the extreme, the "individual" is also a part of the "environment." In other words, the local affairs are a part of the whole situation, and the "whole" is composed of many "parts." The "individual" is a member of the society and the country, and the society and the country are composed of many "individuals." If the "part" is not good, how can we seek the good of the "whole"? If the "individual" is not good, how can we hope that the society and country composed of "individuals" will have good results? If we want to build a pyramid, we must first have neat and square stones. There is no difference in the affairs of society. How can we arbitrarily say that the "environment is bad"? Confucius said: If the person cultivates himself, the family will be regulated; if the family is regulated, the country will be governed; if the country is governed, the world will be at peace. This is also the meaning. If we want to seek peace in the world first, and then cultivate ourselves, then the world will never be at peace. People often say, "Chinese affairs always go wrong." We must first ask: I am also Chinese, am I good myself? Don't be quick to say that others are not good, and don't blame all the bad things on the abstract "environment" or "society" or "country."

We must all optimistically believe that everything can be solved easily. The way to solve it is: start with the individual.

### Random Thoughts on War

— Mao Ren

The February issue of the American magazine "Crown" used dozens of pieced-together photos to depict "the sad faces of peace," which is extremely apt. It first describes the millions of people who have suffered from the ravages of war, slave laborers, and refugees who have escaped from tyrannical rule, trudging back to their hometowns through unpopulated farmland and destroyed railways and factories. Their old homes, however, are famine-stricken France, Russia, and the Balkans. At the same time, of the 7.7 million Jews in Western Europe, only 1.5 million remain after the war, wandering around and trying to make a living in the Holy Land of Palestine. Then it describes Germany, the defeated country, where people are unemployed and on the verge of starvation. What about the victorious countries? British hotels are empty, clothing relies entirely on rationing, and each person gets one egg and four ounces of sweets per week. The French are sallow and thin. The Italians are even worse off, having tasted the disasters sown by the dictator. The Greeks must fight hard to stabilize their country. In our Asia, India, which was once united in the pursuit of independence and freedom, has now been divided into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. In China, millions of famine victims do not know what peace is, internal strife continues, and the flames of war are everywhere. Japan, however, is working hard under the supervision of the Allied forces. Even the United States, which is blessed by heaven and has both geographical advantages and talent, suffers from rising prices and severe housing shortages. Although the theory of a "new war" is mostly propaganda, they know that permanent peace is still far away, like a mirage. The stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union, one uncompromising and the other determined, is deepening. The threat of the atomic bomb looms, and everyone is at a loss what to do—what a miserable world!

Who made the world so dark, cloudy, and bleak? Of course, it is the dictators and warlords of the invading countries. They are madmen and fools. Wanting to be heroes and conquerors, they do not hesitate to wage wars, causing death and destruction. Therefore, I applaud the execution of war criminals today. However, the method of execution is not very good. I think it should be handled by the people of the ten countries themselves, to show the will of the people and the difficulty of resisting public anger. If the victorious countries make the judgments, no matter how many trials and debates are held, and how many years are spent to show the fairness of the law, there will inevitably be the suspicion of being a victor who is a law unto himself. To make the war criminals who invaded and won also be punished by their own people or the people of the world is, in fact, impossible. It seems easier to have the war criminals who invaded and lost judged by their own people, and it is also justifiable. More importantly, since ordinary patriotism is a good name, and dying at the hands of foreigners is considered a martyr, then if the war criminals of country A are executed by countries B, C, etc., the dead will certainly be proud and comforted by "sacrificing for the country," and their people will also have this feeling. Goering's suicide before his execution won the praise of the Germans, isn't this kind of mentality obvious? In history, few political and military "great heroes" have not been scolded by enlightened people in later generations. What is strange is that even though they are scolded, heroes are still to be made, even at the cost of sacrificing themselves. What is the reason? One of them is: those who scold him also praise him incessantly while scolding him. I remember that at the beginning of the European War, an American reporter scolded Hitler for being damned, saying that he had the same aggressive ambitions as Frederick the Great, and was just as killable. At the time, I thought that if Hitler saw this article, he would definitely say, "I just want to be Frederick. If the late king had not wantonly engaged in aggression, how could he have been called the Great? You, who are scolding him to death, are not praising him incessantly as 'the Great'?" Now, the trial of Tojo and the like, although not crowned with the title of "Japanese loyal and patriotic hero," at least gives him an opportunity to take advantage of, and to make grand speeches for the country and the people, and he has the leisure to write memoirs that allow him to talk nonsense. I think it is inevitably a misstep. The way to remedy this is to quickly kill him and feed him to the dogs. If you say this is inevitably barbaric, then there are many barbaric acts that should be done, so why not be barbaric in places where it should be?

After a great war, the world is naturally inevitable suffering from famine and plagues, just like a patient after major surgery, who will not be as healthy as before. Therefore, if a war can truly stop wars, the world will slowly recover after suffering a little pain. The present hunger and cold are really not worth mentioning. However, the current situation shows that there is a great danger of another war, which will turn into war begetting war. What is the reason for this? A foreigner wrote a book called "Why Europe Fights Again" (referring to World War II), in which there is a very interesting sentence: "Everything in history has no real beginning, just as it has no end. But wars always have a starting point, and the true start of this war was on the day the treaty that was originally intended to end the last war was signed, namely June 28, 1919." If the Third World War unfortunately breaks out, historians in later generations will surely say that this war began when Germany and the Soviet Union went to war and the United Kingdom and the United States declared their full support for the Soviet Union!

War is an evil thing, and every international war has a set of beautiful and moving reasons for war. I think today's political leaders and diplomatic experts, while working for world peace in the United Nations, are already considering the reasons for the next great war, preparing to encourage their countrymen to share the same hatred for the enemy!

### The History of Lion Grove Garden

— Wang Baili

Publications state that the Lion Grove Garden in Suzhou was built by the late Yuan dynasty painter Ni Yunlin. When I visited the Lion Grove Garden, the guide also spoke of it with certainty. In reality, both are mistaken. According to Liang Zhangju's "Continuation of Random Notes," Volume 1: a guest invited me to revisit the Lion Grove Garden, but I declined with a smile. Among the gardens in Wu County, I particularly dislike the Lion Grove Garden's crampedness, which is quite depressing. Therefore, during the tenure of the former Governor of Suzhou, I once visited it with a friend, but did not record a single word about it. To say that this garden was built by Ni Yunlin is also a mistake. I once heard from Shi Zhu Dangqianjun that during the Zhizheng period of the Yuan dynasty, the monk Tianru Weize invited Zhu Derun, Zhao Shanchang, Ni Yunlin, and Xu Youwen to jointly plan and build it, with Yunlin providing the design. It was named after the "lion's seat" in Buddhist scriptures. During the Ming dynasty, it still belonged to the Huazhi Temple. In the early Qing dynasty, it was occupied by civilians and fell into disrepair for a long time. In the twenty-seventh year of the Qianlong Emperor's southern tour to Wu, the overgrown weeds were cleared, and protective walls were built. Within, there were scenic spots such as Lion Peak, Hanhui Peak, Tuyue Peak, Lixue Hall, Woyun Chamber, Wenmei Pavilion, Zhibai Xuan, Yujian Pond, Binghu Well, Xiuzhu Valley, Little Flying Rainbow, and the Great Stone House. There were also five large pine trees that could be embraced, so it was also known as the Five Pine Garden, which is little known. Based on this, although this garden was not built solely by Ni, Ni did participate in its construction and provided the design. Later generations mistakenly attributed it to him because of his great fame.

### The Wandering Flower

— Chen Shengyan

Chapter 11: A Heart Full of Suspicion (88)

Zhongjie said, "Does this even need me to say more? Everyone knows that you keep an extremely beautiful little rascal in your house! He hid when I came, and appeared as soon as I left. That person might even be hiding in your room right now!" Qihuan, her lips trembling, said in a shaky voice, "Please be clear, I am not that kind of person!" Zhongjie snorted through his nose and said, "What! You still won't admit it? If I catch that小子, he will be executed immediately. Not only him, but you won't get off easy either. Because of you, I almost lost my job. I'm not willing to be a fool. You quickly call that 小子 out!" Qihuan said, "Chief Miao, please don't listen to other people's gossip. I wouldn't be so base. If I want to make friends, I can do so openly and honestly. Why would I be secretive? This is someone fabricating rumors to intentionally slander us." Zhongjie said, "Anyway, I don't have time to argue with you. If you want to prove your innocence, then come with me! I have nothing more to say. Otherwise, I won't let you off easy! Make your choice." After Zhongjie finished speaking, he stood up, reaching into his pocket. Judging by his expression, it seemed he was about to take out a pistol. Qihuan, by nature, was extremely stubborn. After being repeatedly humiliated by Zhongjie, she had reached her limit. Steel in her heart, she thought to herself that sooner or later, she would die anyway, so why should I continue to placate him! Immediately, she furrowed her brow and said loudly, "You are insulting me too much. I cannot endure your insults! If you want to force me to go with you, that's not going to happen. Don't even think about it. Do whatever you want, I'm not afraid!" Zhongjie shouted, "Fine!" Suddenly, he took out a pistol from his pocket, pointing it at Qihuan's chest, and said, "I'll just shoot you dead!" Qihuan stuck out her chest and moved forward, saying, "Shoot me dead then, I'm not afraid!" At this critical moment, Little Wang Ma and Qihuan's older brother Xiao He rushed in, placing themselves between the two, blocking Zhongjie's gun. It turned out that Xiao He had seen the news in the newspaper today, and heard many rumors from the outside. He felt that his sister had caused such trouble, and it was not a good look for the opera community. He took the newspaper and came to Qihuan's house, originally intending to advise Qihuan to be more discreet and protect her reputation. Unexpectedly, when he walked in, he caught Zhongjie and Qihuan arguing in the room. He didn't want to interrupt, so he and Little Wang Ma quietly listened outside the side door. At first, when he heard Zhongjie scolding Qihuan for keeping a gigolo, he felt indignant. Later, when he saw Zhongjie take out a gun to threaten her, he and Little Wang Ma rushed in, placing themselves between the two and saying, "Please don't resort to violence, let's talk it over." Zhongjie shouted, "Who are you?" Xiao He said, "I am Qihuan's older brother."

### The Wisdom of Animals

— Mao Yi

The wisdom of life is evident everywhere in the animal kingdom. We casually discuss the extraordinary behaviors of animals, calling it instinct.

For scholars who study animal behavior, this question is as incomprehensible as it is for us. All we can say is to acknowledge that animals, even the lowest of them, possess unbelievable wisdom—but we know that it is so, but not why it is so.

For example, take bees. They have established a culture that humanity could never dream of. They labor, build, and save; they obey laws and punish those who violate them; their lives and actions everywhere demonstrate the highest level of patriotism.

Let us think about the spider and its web. It seems to have studied all the engineering arts. It builds a path to life for itself and sets up a path to death for those who are caught in the net. The sliding rope on a ship, used for escaping during a storm, was improved with reference to the spider web.

Long before the time of Archimedes, the little otter had established one of the basic principles of engineering. Long before humans built the first bridge, the otter had established its dam era. It also built its own winter dwelling and warehouse. Are we willing to treat cats and dogs as mere playthings? The cat is the most sensitive of animals. If you put it in a sack or a box and release it several miles away, it can still find its way back home. The dog is the most loyal; countless heroic dogs have used their wits to save their masters, who are the spirits of all things!

A lost person can find their way home by following the constellations, and we praise this person as clever. However, many horses can carry their lost masters home in the dark of night. Some horses can even carry drunk or unconscious drivers to their destination in the crowded streets of large cities.

This extraordinary sense of direction is most strongly displayed by pigeons. One pigeon once flew from Rome back to its shed in England. It flew over a thousand miles, crossed a series of mountains and twenty miles of ocean, and it only took one month.

Humans pride themselves as the spirits of all things, but when compared in terms of instinct, humans are not "spiritual" in every aspect.

### Methods of Changing Couplets

— Qing Lei Xuetu

I received the Shenbao on the Lantern Festival in the old lunar calendar and saw in the Hong Kong news that General Li Jishen, who was living there, had written his own Spring Festival couplet: "All Chinese Army officers are my juniors," "All famous generals in Guangdong are my students." What great arrogance! It's like the couplet presented by famous scholars from Zhejiang to the elderly Hanlin scholar Sun (Qiangming) of Ruian during the late Qing dynasty: "All Hanlin scholars in the world are juniors," "Two prime ministers and generals are my students." If old-fashioned essayists were to discuss this matter, even if they didn't say "plagiarism," they would inevitably criticize it as "having a basis." In reality, copying the old is not absolutely unacceptable. Some are "bluer than blue," some are "following in footsteps, unable to catch up," some are "turning iron into gold," and some are "an insult to Xishi." As for whether the copying is good or not, it depends on the factual content, talent, and technique. Regarding the above couplet by Li, whether those military officers were actually his "juniors" or "students" is impossible to determine due to lack of investigation, so it's difficult to comment. The precision of his writing is naturally self-evident. Now, let's talk about the couplet by old Mr. Sun, and the superiority and inferiority will naturally be clear.

Old Mr. Sun was from Ruian County, Wenzhou Prefecture, Zhejiang Province. His name was Qiangming, his style name was Shaofu. He was a Hanlin scholar in the Xin Chou year of the Daoguang era of the Qing dynasty, only in his twenties. In the Dingwei year, he was the co-examiner for the provincial examination, and he selected two historically famous figures, Li Hongzhang and Shen Baozhen, who were both recommended by him. They became Jinshi graduates and entered the Hanlin Academy. During the years when the Taiping Rebellion army fought, he repeatedly won victories. Li held the position of Governor of Jiangsu, was enfeoffed as a First-Class Marquis Weiyi, and rose to the position of Grand Scholar and Governor-General of Zhili. Grand Scholar was the equivalent of prime minister in ancient times. Shen served as Governor of Jiangxi, captured Hong Xiuquan's son Fu, and was also granted a hereditary title. He later served as Governor-General of Liangjiang, also known as "Zhijun," with the authority of a great general. Li and Shen were not only high-ranking officials, but also prominent figures of the time, so "two prime ministers and generals are my students" was indeed worth boasting about. Li and Shen were both Hanlin scholars of the Daoguang era, and by the early years of the Guangxu era, they were veterans of four reigns. Moreover, they were still considered Mr. Sun's students. (Shen had passed away many years when Sun celebrated his seventieth birthday.) Previous colleagues and Xin Chou classmates had passed away one by one. The senior Hanlin officials that were still living were of classes after Mr. Sun, so "all Hanlin scholars in the world are my juniors" was also absolutely true. These two lines can be said to have magnificent imagery. If later generations want to copy them, they should carefully consider it. The best way to learn from the creations of predecessors is to skillfully adapt them, with each reflecting their own identity and spirit. It is wonderful if others cannot see the imitation. Even if others can see the imitation, they should still praise the adaptation's adherence to principles. For example, there was a eulogy couplet on Zeng Wenzheng's "Record of Mourning": "In life, friendship combined mentor and friend," "Throughout eternity, one feather in the clouds." The author, Ouyang, indeed had a relationship of mentor and friend with Zeng Gong. Zeng's status was very fitting with Zhuge Liang's merit, so it was considered a fine work. Therefore, Du Jidao, in his eulogy for Wu Zhipu, also started with "In life, friendship combined mentor and friend." The second line was then replaced with Cao Cao's words to Liu Bei in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "The heroes of the world are only you and me." The three characters "and me" were removed, and the meaning could still be understood. The sentence structure and number of characters were exactly opposite to the first line, both praising old Wu and expressing self-confidence, without leaving any trace. It was truly a clever mind and skillful hand, without any stiffness. Furthermore, the old Beijing opera actor Bu Yaoqing wrote a eulogy for the old opera actor Chen Delin. Because old Wang's age and seniority were much later than old Chen's, but he wasn't his student, the first line also started with "In life, friendship combined mentor and friend." The second line then used the "Song of Everlasting Regret": "One parting, voice and appearance both vanish." Chen and Wang were both outstanding talents in the opera world, and the words "voice and appearance" were intentionally or unintentionally linked, which can be called clever and exquisite, like a seamless garment (this couplet was written by Shi Kan, a Fujian poet who was a friend of Yaoqing). As for Yang Laowu (Shiqi)'s eulogy for Yu Huilao (Shimei), the first line also started with "In life, friendship combined mentor and friend," which was in accordance with the friendship between the two sides. The second line then used "Throughout eternity, one feather in the clouds," which was to elevate Huilao's status, completely copying Ouyang's eulogy for old Zeng. It was easy to write, and could bring a smile. In the early years of the Republic of China (late winter of the Wuwu year), Yuan Hanyun had a fine paper and wanted to write a couplet as a gift. I asked him to first write "How could my articles startle the world," and Hanyun said: The second line must be "in vain, carriages and horses stopped at the riverbank". I said that was too familiar and had to be changed. Bu Linwu said, "Then 'never before have restraints or officials arrived'". I disliked the scholarly air was too heavy, and the phrase "in vain, carriages and horses" were too blatant. In the end, Hanyun revised it to "in vain, I have thrown my heart into writing lyrics", and I wrote it down. Later, I felt that although this pair was appropriate, it was still of the nature of "Hanyun Hut," because he was a full-fledged "lyricist," but the Ling Han Pavilion had never put this much effort into it.

The "Worry and Joy Magazine" once published an elegy for Zhang Weiping's mother, who remained chaste after her husband died, born on the fifteenth day of the winter month, and died in the middle of autumn: "Following her husband what, following her son what, great integrity, life and death, friendship is important," "the fifteenth day of the winter month, the fifteenth day of mid-autumn, clear light coming and going, the moon is bright in the middle." The second line has the same meaning as the second line of Zhang Sima's elegy for Madam Shen Wensu: "Born in mid-autumn, died in mid-autumn, a bright moon in the sky, a fairy in a rainbow skirt proves her previous life," but each is unique in its appearance.

Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

Old mother and weak sister, rebellious son acts as a tyrant, seizes inheritance and intends to swallow it alone, abundant farmland only creates evil for descendants

Wang Zhifang asked: A certain woman, Jia, lost her husband. She had one son and three daughters. After painstakingly raising them to adulthood, her eldest son, after getting married, though with an ample income, neglected his mother and sisters. Her late husband left behind quite a bit of real estate, but did not leave a will before his death. Her son intends to seize it all for himself. Now there are several questions, please answer them: (1) What proportion should this inheritance be divided according to? Is it illegal for Jia's son to try to seize it all? (2) Do the two married daughters have the right to inherit? (3) Jia's son intends to seize the property and therefore published a statement saying: "The real estate cannot be sold without his consent," is this legal? (4) All the deeds of the land are in Jia's son's hands, but the account name is still the late husband's name, and it has not been transferred. Now Jia is marrying off her daughter, can she use this property? (5) Jia wanted to divide the property, but her son opposed it and failed. What should be done according to law? (6) Jia's son disregards his mother's life, how should she ask him for support? (7) If a son abuses his biological mother, can he be charged with abandonment according to law?

[Legal Advisor Mr. Tang Mingshi answers]

(1) According to the current law, when a spouse and direct descendants are co-inheritors, their share should be divided equally among the other inheritors. (Refer to Article 1144, Paragraph 1 and Article 1138 of the Civil Code). (2) According to the current law, whether married or unmarried, women have the right to inherit. However, the question is whether the date of Jia's husband's death was before the women obtained the right to inherit. (3) Jia's son is also one of the joint inheritors. The published statement that it cannot be sold without his consent is effective. (4) Before the division, it cannot be determined which property each person should inherit. In this case, it should be divided first, and then each can dispose of their own property. (5) This case can be sued for division of property. (6) A lawsuit should be filed for support according to law. (Refer to Articles 1114 to 1121 of the Civil Code). (7) If it meets the conditions for abandonment, a criminal lawsuit can be filed. Article 290 of the Criminal Law stipulates that the penalty for abandoning direct relatives is increased by one-half.
