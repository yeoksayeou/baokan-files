### The National Assembly's Seven Groups Hold Separate Meetings, 100 Proposals Reviewed and Completed, Intense Debate on Constitutional Amendments Reaches No Conclusion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The National Assembly did not hold a general meeting on the 16th. The announcement of the eight presidential candidates was posted in front of the National Assembly Hall at 9:00 AM, attracting a large crowd of citizens and representatives. On the 16th, the seven review committees held separate meetings to review the proposals. The progress of each group was very smooth. One hundred general proposals were all reviewed and completed. However, the First Review Committee, when reviewing the constitutional amendments, engaged in intense debate and reached no conclusion. The General Assembly is scheduled to hold its eleventh meeting on the 17th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The six proposals to amend the Constitution, after being passed for initial reading on the 15th and submitted for review, were discussed at the First Review Committee of the Assembly, namely the Constitution Review Group, which convened at 9:20 AM on the 16th. In addition to submitting the six proposals for discussion, a total of thirteen proposals related to the Constitution were also presented together. 297 members attended the review meeting, chaired by Zhang Zhiben. He first explained that the group's review of each case was divided into four parts: (1) those who advocated amending the Constitution; (2) those who advocated not amending the articles but proposing supplementary measures; (3) those who advocated not amending the Constitution; and (4) those who wanted to determine the term of the National Assembly. Whether to proceed with a categorized broad discussion was then met with some opposition, as some believed that Zhang Zhiben was one of the proposers and should not be the convener of the group, let alone the chairman, which caused some disturbance at the meeting. During the meeting, a total of 21 representatives spoke, dividing into two opposing opinions on amending or not amending. Speakers from both sides received considerable enthusiastic support. Those who opposed amending the Constitution included Su Naxin, Chen Duanben, Fang Mian, Cao Pingfan, Shi Xin San, and Jiang Shiyi. Those who advocated amending the Constitution included Liu Jiashu, Ma Xuchang, Ma Chengji, and Jiang Jianbai. In addition, Wang Chonghui and Pan Gongzhan also put forward new opinions. Wang Chonghui said: The question of constitutional amendment is not whether it can be amended, but whether we can amend it under the current situation. When the Constitution was drafted, it took great pains. Now, during the time of suppression of the rebellion, the time is short. Is it too hasty? Among the proposals advocating constitutional amendments, we believe that the method of convening the National Assembly regularly to amend the constitution is very good. It may be convened at another fixed time. Pan Gongzhan believes that the Constitution has some shortcomings that must be amended, but now the time is pressing. Should the review committee be solely responsible for it and continue its work after the meeting? Secondly, regarding the temporary provisions authorizing the president, he believes that it is a need of the actual situation. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.

The First Group Reviews the Constitution, Proposers Speak Enthusiastically Both in the Morning and Afternoon

The meeting continued at 3:30 PM, with 296 attendees, chaired by Zhang Yingyi. First, the chairman reported that after the representatives spoke in the morning on the various cases related to the constitutional amendment, the opinions were divided into two parts: one advocating amendment and the other not agreeing to amendment. Now, 75 more people have requested to speak, and the constitutional proposals have been divided into four parts. In addition to the two parts of whether to amend or not, there are also: (1) adding temporary clauses to authorize the president to handle emergencies; (2) regularly convening a temporary National Assembly. It is hoped that the speeches in the afternoon will focus on these two points, and everyone will abide by the time so that a conclusion can be reached and submitted to the second reading meeting on the 17th. Secondly, among the 13 proposals, there are still some that have not been explained by the proposers. Lin Bin explained the main points of his proposal "Proposal for Regularly Convening a Temporary National Assembly". Then, Shi Shangkuan explained his proposal "Please this National Assembly formulate the implementation procedures of the Constitution to facilitate the implementation of the Constitution". Next, Zhou Lisheng explained the main points of his proposal "Intend to collect the opinions on amending the Constitution and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for constitutional implementation, or specially form a committee to sort out and study, and draft a bill to be submitted to this Temporary General Assembly for decision". He advocated amending the Constitution but did not agree to amend it immediately. Luo Wenmo explained his proposal "Please convene a temporary National Assembly within two years after the closing of this General Assembly, in accordance with the provisions of Article 30, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the Constitution, to amend the Constitution". Representative Pan Gongzhan's proposal was reissued on the 16th, "Please the General Assembly decide on the date of the second meeting of this National Assembly so that the representatives can continue to exercise their political power on behalf of the people". The method is to hold the opening ceremony of the first second meeting on December 25, 1950. If the suppression of the rebellion is completed earlier, it can be convened in advance. Pan explained that the reason why he specified December 25, 1950, is that the Constitution has been promulgated for four years, and the suppression of the rebellion should be completed in the next two years or so. If it is rigidly stipulated as "after the completion of the suppression of the rebellion", it would be inappropriate. What if we encounter foreign troubles after the suppression of the rebellion is completed? After the report, continue to speak in order. Dai Tianqiu and others still said that the preamble of the Constitution once stated that it was based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, but the content was not so. We should not restrict the law with facts and must make some remedies. Zhou Junshi shouted loudly that the principle of the constitutional amendment proposal had been passed at the first reading meeting on the 15th, and it should be voted on today without discussion. Zhou's speech caused another commotion at the meeting. Later, Zheng Xiuqing spoke, expressing sympathy for the proposal to authorize the president. Xie Chengping said: There is no need to argue too much about whether to amend the constitution or not. He said that he accepted Pan Gongzhan's proposal to convene a temporary National Assembly for constitutional amendment in two years. Zhou Lisheng's case can also be carefully studied. Everyone must unite and not act impulsively. Gu Zhenggang said that as a member of the Kuomintang, he also believes that the Constitution does not meet Sun Yat-sen's ideals and should be amended, but from the perspective of the actual situation, if we pay attention to ideals, we must also take into account ideals, which is impossible. The current task is to fully suppress the communist rebellion. It is suggested that Pan and Luo's cases be merged, and the temporary meeting be held on December 25, 1950. The temporary provisions are needed for the facts, and everyone will definitely agree. The constitutional amendments that have not been discussed will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to formulate amendments and submit them to the next temporary meeting for discussion. Gu's speech ended at 6:00 PM, and the meeting adjourned. No conclusion was reached today. Whether the agenda will be changed on the 17th will be discussed and decided by the General Assembly on the 17th.

### The Fifth Review Committee

Passes Six Social Security Proposals

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Fifth Review Committee held meetings on the 16th, both in the morning and afternoon, to discuss six proposals related to social security. In the morning, Chairman Li Hongwen first conducted a preliminary study of each case. In the afternoon, Chairman Chen Jianxiu passed the review opinions on each case around 5:00 PM: (1) Yu Jichuan and others proposed that the government should clearly stipulate effective measures to relieve the poor in order to maintain people's livelihood. (2) Lan Wenbin and others proposed that all provinces and cities should earnestly carry out relief undertakings. The two cases were reviewed and passed after amendment. (3) Luo Dafan and others proposed that the government should reform the education policy to save learning time and accelerate education progress. The review opinion was amended and passed. (4) Lin Jing and others proposed to ban smoking and drugs in order to strengthen the foundation of the country. The review opinion was passed. (5) Tao Guilin and others proposed that the government should designate special donations for post-war reconstruction for the property losses of all people during the war. The review opinion was amended and passed. (6) Chen Jixian and others proposed that the government should quickly find ways to relieve the refugee women and protect the children in the pacification area in order to maintain the foundation of the country. The review opinion was passed.

### Presidium Meeting, Agreeing on the Agenda for Today's General Assembly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The National Assembly Presidium held a meeting on the evening of the 16th to discuss the agenda for the 17th. It was decided that the General Assembly would be held on the morning of the 17th. The second reading and third reading of the constitutional amendment were originally scheduled to be held on the 17th. Because the First Group's review of the constitutional amendment has not yet yielded results, the first reading and third approval meetings have been postponed to the morning and afternoon of the 18th. The date for the presidential election on the 19th remains unchanged. At the General Assembly on the morning of the 17th, the convener of the First Review Committee will report on the progress of the constitutional amendment review on the 16th, and solicit the opinions of the General Assembly on whether it needs to be submitted for review again.

### The Second Review Committee, Proposals Related to National Defense, Divided into Four Categories for Review

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Second Review Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM on the 16th to review 32 proposals related to national defense. 180 members attended, with Xu Peigen as chairman. First, the review method was discussed. After a long time, it was decided that the convener would first classify the proposals according to their nature and then divide them into several groups for review. The meeting then adjourned. The people continued to meet and divided the proposals into four groups: (1) general reform of national defense and military affairs, (2) strengthening the military structure for suppressing the rebellion, (3) strengthening border defense, and (4) people's self-defense and suppression of the rebellion. When the meeting continued at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the four groups were sent for preliminary review.

The General Reform of National Defense and Military Affairs Group reviewed seven proposals, the most important of which were Huo Tianyi and others' proposal to investigate Liang Huasheng for dereliction of duty during the withdrawal from Jilin, and He Foqing and others' proposal to severely punish Chief of Staff Chen Cheng. The members argued for a long time. Finally, it was decided that the review opinion was that the former should be sent to the government for investigation, and the latter should be sent to the government for reference. The other cases were sent to the government for reference, attention, or handling.

The Strengthening the Military Structure for Suppressing the Rebellion Group reviewed five proposals. The main content of each case was to strengthen the structure, jurisdiction, and powers of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters. After reviewing the four cases together, it was decided to put forward four points in the review opinion: (1) urge the government to decree that the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters is the highest military and political command organization in North China, and the Beiping Executive Headquarters should be abolished; (2) the jurisdiction should include the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin; (3) Fu Zuoyi should be responsible for organizing and training 30 new divisions, actively equipping them, and completing 10 divisions within six months; (4) when the number of soldiers in the jurisdiction is insufficient, the Ministry of National Defense should allocate and replenish them. In addition, specific opinions were also put forward on unifying and expanding the powers of the general bandit suppression command organization.

The Strengthening Border Defense Group reviewed six proposals, which were merged into four cases for review. The specific opinions were: (1) complete the Kunming-Luoyang Highway and the secret highway's national border section within a time limit; (2) dispatch a large army out of the pass to save the critical situation in Northeast China; (3) ask the government to convene a border affairs conference in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Xikang, and invite Yi ethnic representatives to participate; (4) prevent the communist bandits from fleeing to Sichuan and continue to deploy the defense of Bashan, and suggest that the government refer to it for handling.

The People's Self-Defense and Suppression of the Rebellion Group reviewed ten proposals, which were merged for review. The specific opinions were: (1) awaken the people to strengthen the methods of suppressing the rebellion, and ask the government to consider and implement them; (2) strengthen the military force among the people in the border areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan, and ask the government to coordinate the handling; (3) step up general mobilization and improve the methods of local self-defense organizations, and transfer them to the government for reference.

### The Sixth Review Committee

Advocates Establishing Schools for the Descendants of Martyrs

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Sixth Review Committee convened at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 16th. 195 members attended, chaired by Mei Yiqi. The nine educational and cultural proposals scheduled were all reviewed. All members were from the educational and cultural circles, and the review went very smoothly. Among them, the proposal to establish schools for the descendants of martyrs submitted by Yu Bin and others and the proposal on the proportion of educational funds in the budget submitted by Wang Yizhou and others were discussed most enthusiastically. Yu Bin did not attend due to business, and Mao Yanwen explained on his behalf. Fu Baochang's proposal to establish a school for the descendants of rebels in North China was also included in Yu's case for review. The review opinions for each case are as follows: (1) Shui Zi and others proposed that, in accordance with the Constitution, the national treasury should subsidize the educational and cultural funds of remote provinces in order to achieve balanced development. It is proposed to pass it. (2) Da Fan and others proposed to suggest that the government reform the education policy to save learning time and accelerate education progress. (3) Wang Jian Du and others proposed to set up public-funded degrees. Li Huan and others proposed to set up a Shao Li Chuandong University or industrial and commercial vocational school at the old site of the Sichuan Wanxian Tuokou Arsenal for further education and macro education. For the above three cases, it is proposed to retain them. (5) An and others proposed to actively promote blind and deaf education, determine the special party for the blind and deaf, quickly determine the implementation plan, and formulate laws to protect their welfare. It is proposed to pass it in principle. (6) Wang Yizhou and others, it is proposed that the National Government, starting from this year, should strictly compile and list the proportion of educational funds stipulated in the Constitution, and allocate a large amount of basic education expenses from them in order to implement basic education extensively and consolidate the foundation of constitutional government. It is proposed to send it to the government for earnest handling. (7) Yu Bin and others proposed to universally establish schools for the descendants of martyrs in order to thoroughly solve the problem of rescuing and supporting the descendants of martyrs and to cultivate basic talents for production and construction in the country and society. It is proposed to pass it. (8) Wang Yizhou and others proposed that there are many young people who have dropped out of school in the pacification area. It is proposed that the Central Government should quickly set up temporary secondary schools in appropriate areas according to the size of the rebel area in order to rescue them. It is proposed to pass it in principle and suggest amending the government. (9) Fu Baochang and others proposed: Please the government establish schools for the descendants of rebels in North China, prepare to establish a Northeast United University, and establish border schools. The first part is incorporated into Yu Bin's proposal, and the rest is proposed to be passed.

### Suggest the Government Earnestly Protect Rights and Urge the Soviet Union to Fulfill the Treaty. The Third Review Committee Amends Diplomatic Proposals

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Third Review Committee continuously convened in the morning and afternoon of the 16th to review diplomatic proposals. The meeting was hosted by Convener Mo Dehui at 9:30 AM. More than 30 members attended. First, they studied and reviewed the proposal submitted by Wu Huanzhang and others, "Please, in the name of the General Assembly, formally inform the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance within a time limit in order to show international credibility. If a satisfactory result is not obtained by the deadline, our country should immediately, based on the independent and autonomous position, solemnly declare the abolition of the Yalta Secret Agreement and the Sino-Soviet Treaty created by the errors of the agreement." Representatives Cheng Bingzhang, Hu Jingan, Qian Tianren, Chen Benduan, Liao Chongzhen, Huang Tingying, Zhang Guochen, Wang Keda, Huyan Pili, Zhou Gengsheng, Lei Zhen, Mo Dehui, Zhou Qianchong, Wang Shuren, etc., spoke enthusiastically, discussing the legal principles and facts in detail. All agreed that the measures listed in the original proposal to abolish the treaty were unilateral acts and difficult to supplement in practice. However, the National Assembly should express public opinion on this matter. Finally, according to the opinions of Lei Zhen and Mo Dehui, the measures of the case were amended to: "(1) the construction government urges the Soviet Union to thoroughly fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty and return all the materials and machinery transported out of the country during the Soviet military's stationing in Northeast China; (2) if the Soviet Union delays in fulfilling it, our government should consider the situation and submit it to the United Nations organization and take all effective measures when necessary to safeguard our country's territorial sovereignty." Resolution: It is proposed to pass it and send it to the government for earnest handling. The meeting adjourned at noon.

Please the Government to Consider Initiating the Southeast Asian Anti-Communist Agreement

The meeting continued at 4:00 PM, chaired by Zhou Gengsheng, to review the proposal submitted by Cao Tingguang and others, "Please the government initiate the organization of the Southeast Asian Security Military Alliance to safeguard democracy and peace in Southeast Asia." After the proposer Cao Tingguang briefly explained, Qian Tianren, Wang Keda, Chen Boji, Yu Bin, Hu Jingan, Lei Zhen, etc., spoke successively. All believed that the content of the explanation in this case was largely inconsistent with our country's current policies, and the measures taken were even more difficult to implement due to the facts. Wang Keda especially emphasized the trend of the overall situation at home and abroad, opposed the biased spirit of this case, and advocated retaining it. Finally, after Zhou Gengsheng, Lei Zhen, and the proposer studied and responded, it was proposed to amend the measures of the case and send them directly to the government for reference by the Presidium. This was agreed by the majority of the attending representatives, and the measures were amended to: "(1) our country's government should consider the situation and initiate the conclusion of the Southeast Asian regional agreement, inviting India, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, and other countries to participate. Australia and New Zealand can also join. (2) The countries participating in the agreement should jointly prevent the intrusion of communist forces and seek to increase economic cooperation. (3) For the purpose of discussing and concluding the above agreement and issues concerning the security order in the Southeast Asian region, our country's government shall convene a meeting of the above-mentioned countries when necessary." At this point, the only two proposals of the diplomatic group have been carefully studied and prudently handled, and the meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.

### The Fourth Group Reviews Economic Proposals, Advocates Requisitioning the Assets of the Wealthy, Implementing Land Reform to Clear the Source of Chaos

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Fourth Group Review Committee convened at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 16th. More than 100 members attended, chaired by Weng Wenhao. A total of 36 proposals from the National Economic Group were reviewed. First, the convener divided them into five categories: (1) finance, banking, and currency system, (2) land, agriculture, and land reclamation, (3) food, (4) transportation, (5) economic policy. After the representatives agreed, the review began. In the morning, nine proposals related to finance, banking, and the currency system were passed. Among them, He Foqing and others proposed to requisition the funds of the wealthy stored in the United States to stabilize the financial situation and benefit the suppression of the rebellion. Weng Cheng and others proposed to formulate laws, investigate the capital of the wealthy, collect special donations, and allocate them to a fund for relieving refugees. Long Wen and others proposed to suggest borrowing deposits from the wealthy to provide for national use to reduce the burden on the people and curb the source of chaos. After submitting for joint discussion, Pei Mingyu, Huang Zhan, He Foqing, Ni Zhichao, and others spoke successively, all criticizing the capital of the wealthy and advocating that laws should be formulated to requisition the capital of the wealthy and the assets stored in the United States by Chinese people. After that, the three cases were merged. It is proposed that the General Assembly should consult the government to formulate measures for requisitioning the assets of the wealthy and earnestly handle them within three months. Regarding the three proposals for reforming the currency system, the review opinion is that it is proposed to pass them in principle and hand them over to the government to organize a research association on currency system reform to study methods and implement them quickly. The review continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, chaired by Xu Jiguang. All 36 proposals have been reviewed and completed. In the afternoon, the discussion on proposals related to land reform was the most enthusiastic. There are a total of three cases: (1) Liu Gui and others proposed to implement land-to-the-tiller within a time limit and immediately impose a progressive property tax. (2) Jiao Yitang and others proposed to suggest that all land in the country be nationalized, and land be distributed according to the number of people to eliminate the source of chaos and benefit the suppression of the rebellion. (3) Zhu Ping and others proposed to suggest that the government quickly and comprehensively implement land reform to clear the source of chaos and lay the foundation for the country. During the discussion, Liu Gui, Zhu Ping, and others stood up and explained that the main reason why the communist bandits are able to cause trouble is that the government has failed to implement the land-to-the-tiller policy in Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. Zhu Ping shouted loudly that without implementing the land policy, the suppression of the rebellion will not be completed. After merging for discussion, Liu Gui and Zhu Ping's cases were passed according to the original cases and sent to the government for earnest handling. The method is that the landlord's land should belong to the tillers, and the tillers should pay rent in installments within the next five years to obtain land ownership. Jiao Yitang's case was retained. Pan Gongzhan and others proposed that the National Government should issue an order to exempt food sales tax to maintain people's food and relieve the people's difficulties, which was also passed in principle and sent to the relevant government agencies for adoption and handling.

### Pan Gongzhan Advocates Constitutional Amendment, But Emphasizes Careful Deliberation and Scrutiny; Excessive Power of the Legislative Yuan is a Shortcoming of the Current Constitution

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] Mr. Pan Gongzhan, a National Assembly representative from the Shanghai district, responded to reporters' inquiries on the 16th regarding the constitutional amendment issue, stating:

(1) Constitutionalism in any country is a process of growth, and the constitution is also a product of evolution. While the constitution is not an ordinary law, it is certainly not immutable. Moreover, the amendment of the constitution in our country is originally a power exercised by the National Assembly according to law, and no one within or outside the Assembly can restrict or deprive it. However, the constitution is, after all, the fundamental law, and the National Assembly must act with utmost caution when amending it. Recalling the constitutional drafting process the year before last, it seemed to have been done in haste, with mutual compromises and forced agreements, inevitably resulting in shortcomings that are now felt and regretted by all parties. If this National Assembly, again in haste, focuses on the deliberation and revision of clauses and sentences and makes resolutions immediately, there is a risk of repeating past mistakes. It would be best to conduct a longer period of review and discussion, and not make hasty decisions. In my opinion, the current session of the Assembly should authorize the Constitutional Review Committee to conduct a long-term and detailed review of the points that were not resolved in this session, after the first meeting is convened, and submit a detailed report for a solemn revision at the second meeting of the current National Assembly, in order to demonstrate the solemnity of the constitution.

(2) In my humble opinion, the current constitution has at least two major shortcomings: (1) The powers of the National Assembly are actively restricted, while the powers of the Legislative Yuan are expanded infinitely. Under this system, the power of the Legislative Yuan cannot be checked and balanced by any other body, greatly undermining the original intention of the separation of powers. Of course, the legislators are also popularly elected, but the Legislative Yuan has only one chamber, unlike the parliaments of other countries that have upper and lower houses or senates and houses of representatives. We must give the National Assembly the power to initiate and veto central laws, so that the Legislative Yuan will not act arbitrarily and unilaterally. (Parliaments in other countries have upper and lower houses that can check each other, and there is also a check and balance between the parliament and the cabinet through votes of no confidence in the government and dissolution of parliament, which are absent in our current constitution. This creates a constitution where the Legislative Yuan has unilateral power.) (2) The President is originally the head of state, commanding the army, navy, and air force, but given the current situation in China, especially during the period of mobilization for the suppression of rebellion, if we follow the current constitution, the President will have no power and no real authority to accomplish the mission of suppressing the rebellion. Even the executive branch will not have the power to take expedient measures in response to the situation. If we do not seek remedies and revisions, the government after the implementation of the constitution will inevitably be a government without power, that is, an incompetent government.

(3) Therefore, I support and second both the amendment proposed by Representative Zhang Zhiben and the proposal for the enactment of temporary provisions by Representative Mo Dehui. Whether it is to enact temporary provisions or amend the constitution, it is necessary to study, remedy, and correct this constitution. This is a necessary step to adapt to the national conditions and cope with the overall situation.

(4) Finally, in my opinion, since the constitutional amendment proposals submitted by the representatives have been placed on the agenda and have passed the first reading, they should be reviewed and then subjected to the second and third readings, according to procedure. Whether supporting or opposing, all should have the right to speak and discuss fully, and then put to a vote according to law. Obstructing others from speaking or refusing to obey the vote is not in the spirit of democracy. However, in other countries' parliaments, the procedure of three readings for each major bill is sometimes not completed in the same meeting. Therefore, if the proposals submitted for review at this session are delayed due to time constraints, and the review report is submitted when the next session is convened, and then submitted for the second or third reading, there is nothing legally wrong with that, and it is worthy of consideration by colleagues in the Assembly.

### Urge the Government to Develop the Border Regions; The Seventh Review Committee Completes its Work

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] The Seventh Review Committee convened a meeting at 10 a.m. on the 16th to review proposals related to the border regions. 167 representatives attended, chaired by Bai Chongxi. Leng Huiran and others proposed a "motion urging the government to promptly handle the affairs of the southwestern ethnic minorities to prevent border troubles." The wording of the motion was initially opposed by border representative Fu Zhengda, who stated that the ethnic minorities absolutely do not want to be enemies with the Han Chinese, but the government's use of force to suppress them only increases hatred. Luo Jialun then stated that past issues should not be investigated, and the motion was shelved. Wu Tiekul from Xinjiang and Zhakisqin from Mongolia both emphasized that border issues are ethnic issues, and Zhakisqin further argued that solving the problem of livelihood is the fundamental solution to all problems. Lin Jing believed that to solve the issue of ethnic minorities, the central government and the authorities of Sichuan, Kangding, and Yunnan provinces must hold a joint border affairs meeting to first determine the policy. He proposed revising the wording of the motion to "urge the government to promptly handle the affairs of the southwestern ethnic minorities, enhance unity, and strengthen national defense." The emotionally charged words and the entire explanation in the text were deleted, and the resolution was to request the government to implement it earnestly. The committee then discussed the proposal by Luo Zhezhen and others to "request that the rights and interests of border residents to participate in politics be stipulated by law." Item A of the proposal, which concerned participation in political institutions, was transferred to the first group, the constitutional group, because it involved constitutional provisions. Item B, which concerned participation in administrative institutions, proposed suggesting that the government make every effort to cultivate and employ talented border residents, and that the methods should be determined separately according to the different circumstances in each region. Finally, the committee reviewed the proposal by Yin Mingde and others to "request the government to quickly complete the construction of the Kunluo Highway (from Kunming southwest through Wangxi, Ning'er, Simao, Cheli to Daluo on the Yunnan-Burma border) and the Baomi Highway (from Baoshan to Myitkyina) in the southwestern border region, in order to develop the border region, build national defense, and develop international trade, and request a public decision." The review opinion was passed, and it was recommended that the government allocate funds as soon as possible and order the competent authorities to quickly repair and consolidate the two highways. The meeting adjourned at noon, and the review work of the border region group's proposals was completed.

### Editorial: Two Proposals Regarding Constitutional Amendment

After the National Assembly held the first reading of the constitutional amendment proposals, it submitted the proposals to the constitutional group for review yesterday, which sparked a heated debate between representatives who advocated for and opposed the constitutional amendment. It seems that the constitution is bound to be amended; however, we always feel that the constitutional amendment should be discussed at length and treated with special caution. This newspaper's editorial has already expressed a clear view on the constitutional amendment issue. We believe that, from a legal perspective: according to Article 27 of the Constitution, amending the Constitution is one of the powers of the current National Assembly; furthermore, according to Article 174 of the Constitution, as long as the current National Assembly proceeds in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Constitution, that is, upon the proposal of one-fifth of the total number of representatives of the National Assembly, the attendance of one-half, and the resolution of three-fourths of the representatives present, there is absolutely no problem in amending the Constitution. The representatives of the opposition party have no legal justification whatsoever. However, in fact, if the current National Assembly intends to amend the Constitution, it will inevitably cause new political disputes.

When the constitutional group reviewed the proposals yesterday, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and a part of the non-partisan representatives all firmly expressed their opposition to the current National Assembly amending the Constitution. The various reasons they held can be summarized as follows: (1) The Constitution is the fundamental law of the country and should have stability. The Constitution has not yet been implemented, and to amend it immediately seems to contradict the principle of rigidity adopted by our Constitution; (2) No legal or political system is absolutely superior or inferior. Our Constitution has not yet been implemented, so there are no facts that can prove that it is necessary to amend it; (3) When the last National Assembly discussed the draft Constitution, it took a great deal of effort to get the National Assembly to abandon the Five-Five Constitution and adopt a Constitution drafted in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Therefore, our Constitution can be said to be the result of agreements between various political parties. The political environment a month ago was the same as it was the year before last, so it should not be amended; (4) In the current National Assembly, the Kuomintang still occupies an absolute majority and exceeds the total number of representatives of the Democratic Youth Party and non-partisan parties. The Kuomintang should especially respect the opinions of the minority parties. In all fairness, the representatives of the Democratic Youth Party have quite sufficient reasons for opposing the current National Assembly amending the Constitution, but the representatives of the Democratic Youth Party have neglected another factual need that makes it necessary to amend the current Constitution.

Article 43 of the Constitution stipulates: "When the State is confronted with natural calamities, epidemics, or major financial or economic changes requiring urgent measures, the President... may, in accordance with the Emergency Orders Act, issue emergency orders and take necessary measures." However, it does not include the Communist rebellion. If this article of the Constitution is not amended, then the new government that is produced in accordance with the Constitution will either "abandon the suppression of rebellion for the sake of the Constitution" or "violate the Constitution for the sake of the war." Neither of these possible outcomes is what our people want. Because in the former case, democratic constitutionalism will inevitably perish with the demise of the country and the nation; in the latter case, democratic constitutionalism will have a matter of constitutional non-compliance at the beginning, which is definitely not a blessing for our country's democracy. Therefore, in order to "suppress the rebellion on the one hand and implement the Constitution on the other," the proposal for the enactment of temporary provisions for the period of mobilization for the suppression of rebellion, submitted by non-partisan representative Mo Dehui and 1,201 other representatives, is of great significance.

The greatest feature of this proposal is that it does not require amending the Constitution, but only adding a temporary provision that will immediately expire after the successful suppression of the rebellion. This will not only make the government capable, but also enable the government that implements the Constitution to suppress the rebellion, taking both sides into account, which is the most appropriate legislative policy. As the constitutional authority Wang Shijie said: "We want a constitutional government that can suppress the rebellion, and a government that suppresses the rebellion can implement the Constitution." At the same time, if we review the political history of the United States, during the First World War, the United States Congress granted special powers to President Wilson; during the Second World War, the United States Congress also granted special powers to Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, which is an excellent precedent. It is this point that enables the democratic system to adapt to extraordinary events. We believe that the representatives of the Democratic Youth Party, under the major premise of supporting the government in suppressing the rebellion and building the country, will definitely not stubbornly adhere to their own opinions, regard the constitutional articles as golden rules, sacred and inviolable, and oppose any necessary amendments; they will also hope that the National Assembly can seriously review and pass Mo's proposal.

Article 27 of the Constitution stipulates the powers of the National Assembly: (1) to elect the President and Vice President; (2) to recall the President and Vice President; (3) to amend the Constitution; (4) to ratify constitutional amendments proposed by the Legislative Yuan. According to this, the powers of the current National Assembly are only two: (1) to elect the President and Vice President; (2) to amend the Constitution; and amending the Constitution is, in fact, not without difficulties; therefore, the task of the current National Assembly is limited to electing the President and Vice President. However, three thousand national representatives gather in the capital to hold a meeting, only to be allowed to vote to elect the President and Vice President, and not to allow the people's representatives to inquire about national affairs. In economic terms, this is a waste of money and manpower; in terms of reason and emotion, it is also unworkable. Therefore, the National Assembly representatives unanimously requested a review of national affairs; from a legal perspective, this is unavoidable to be suspected of overstepping the boundaries; but in the autumn of national hardship, how can the National Assembly representatives be taught to remain silent? Therefore, the proposal to amend the powers of the National Assembly submitted by Zhang Zhiben and 871 other representatives is also worthy of our attention. Zhang proposed adding two powers to the National Assembly: (1) to initiate legislative principles; (2) to ratify laws related to the rights and obligations of the people. But from our point of view, Zhang's constitutional amendment should be reconsidered. Since the National Assembly is an institution representing the national administrative power, its powers should be limited to the four civil rights. To amend Article 27, it is only necessary to change "but" to "Regarding the two rights of initiative and referendum, the National Assembly shall formulate methods and exercise them." This would include everything.

In short, we originally did not advocate amending the Constitution, not because the current Constitution is perfect and does not need to be amended, but because, in the current political environment, we should avoid causing new political disputes; even if there are places that must be amended in fact, we should discuss them at length and take all aspects into consideration. If we can do this, we will definitely be able to gain the understanding of the opposition party. May the National Assembly representatives act with caution!

### Public Decree by the National Government Praising Kong Xianrong

Chairman Chiang Sends Wu Siyu as His Representative to Offer Sacrifices

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The National Government issued an order on the 16th: National Assembly Representative Kong Xianrong, of upright character, loved his country and his hometown. During the War of Resistance, he initiated and led local militias in guerrilla warfare in the Changbai Mountains, making meritorious contributions. After the victory, he reorganized his troops and served in military posts in the border area, defending the locality with unwavering dedication. Sadly, due to the ongoing difficulties of the time, he passed away from depression during his attendance at the National Assembly, a cause for deep sorrow. He should be publicly praised to commend his loyalty and righteousness.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] When Chairman Chiang met with Mo Dehui on the evening of the 15th, he was deeply saddened to learn of the suicide of Kong Xianrong, a National Assembly representative from Songjiang Province. On the morning of the 16th, when Yu Bin paid his respects, the Chairman conveyed his sentiments and informed him that special personnel had been assigned to handle Kong's funeral arrangements, bereavement compensation, and posthumous commendation.

An emergency meeting was convened at 10:00 AM to discuss the arrangements following Kong's death, attended by Yu Bin and 200 others, with Bi Zezi presiding.

(3) To appoint special personnel to draft a temporary motion for the unanimous endorsement of all Northeast representatives, to be presented to the assembly on the 17th. During the Northeast representatives' meeting, they discussed the reasons for Kong's suicide at length, concluding that under the policy of building local military forces, Kong's suicide was actually due to personnel issues. Some representatives even vehemently criticized the Zhao family for obstructing Kong's efforts to suppress the rebellion and bandits.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] It is reported that Kong Xianrong's only relatives in Nanjing are his nephew and niece-in-law. His nephew, Jian Geng, was originally in prison, but the relevant authorities have agreed to temporarily release him so that he can handle Kong's funeral arrangements. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang deeply mourned Kong's death and presented a eulogy with the four characters "Undying Loyalty."

### No High Peaks in Mount Ji Shi, Guo Qingshan Nearby Reaches 21,000 Feet, Central Aviation Special Plane Returned Safely to Lanzhou After Yesterday's Exploration

[This Newspaper, Lanzhou, 16th] The Central Aviation exploration plane of Mount Ji Shi did not take off on the 16th due to widespread haze. When the weather improved at noon, the C-46 XT-0508 aircraft, carrying reporters and others, a total of nineteen people, who had been waiting at the airport for half a day, soared into the sky at 12:55 PM. The flight was still personally piloted by Chen Wenkuan, Deputy Manager of Central Aviation. At 5:15 PM, the Central Aviation radio station here received a message from the plane, stating briefly: Mount Ji Shi is not as high as expected. The message described the route as follows: Flying west from Lanzhou along the Yellow River, the plane ascended to an altitude of 18,000 feet, but no peaks exceeding 21,000 feet were seen. If there were any, they must have been obscured by clouds. However, it can be concluded that there are no high peaks in the Maqing Mountain Range. The plane then flew to and circled Lake Senoer at 101 degrees East longitude and 33 degrees North latitude for fifteen minutes before turning back. In the twilight, a 21,000-foot high peak was spotted nearby, which was Guo Qingshan. However, due to the late hour, it was not possible to stay any longer. The plane safely arrived in Lanzhou at 7:40 PM.

[This Newspaper, Lanzhou, 16th] The first Chinese woman to fly over 20,000 feet is believed to be this newspaper's female reporter, Hong Xucai. She participated in the Central Aviation special plane's exploration of the height of Mount Ji Shi. After ascending to 20,000 feet, she relied on oxygen to breathe. In addition to constantly monitoring the altitude, she also took photographs. Her courage was widely praised.

### Eastern Taiwan Has Abundant Mineral Resources, Hoping the Government Will Expedite Development

Taiwan Provincial Assembly Speaker Discusses His Inspection Tour

[This Newspaper, Taipei, 16th] Huang Chaoqin, Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, recently returned from an inspection tour of eastern Taiwan. He told reporters this afternoon that although eastern Taiwan is infertile and its people are poor, it is of particular value in terms of national defense. He emphasized that the central government should pay special attention to studying and developing it. At present, eastern Taiwan is facing serious flooding and transportation is blocked, so it is urgently necessary to repair dikes and build roads. The region is rich in gold, silver, timber, and mineral resources, and its fishery production is very high, so investments should be made to develop these resources. He advocated that the government should encourage immigration to eastern Taiwan and quickly restore water conservancy and transportation, otherwise, in a few years, eastern Taiwan will become a sandy beach, not only losing a national defense fortress, but also causing the current hundreds of thousands of residents to have no means of survival. Huang will invite the heads of relevant departments and offices of the provincial government in the next few days to discuss this issue.

### National Assembly Chronicle Two Major Camps: Amending the Constitution vs. Protecting the Constitution

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Protecting the Constitution and amending the Constitution were originally two aspects of the same thing, but in the National Assembly hall, where politics and law are confused, the two have clearly become two opposing camps. Those who advocate amending the Constitution hope to fill in some loopholes in the Constitution and make it a perfect Constitution. This cannot be said to be protecting the Constitution, and naturally this is from a legal point of view. Those who advocate not amending the Constitution are afraid that the Constitution will be hastily amended in a hurry, which will damage the dignity of the Constitution and hinder the overall spirit of the Constitution. This is protecting the Constitution, but this should be said to be of a political nature, because this fundamental law is the result of party consultations. According to the law, it needs to be amended. In theory, Kuomintang representatives also want to amend it, but some people oppose amending it, which is political.

The Constitution Review Committee held a meeting all day long. There were few speakers, and more people wanted to speak. However, in the end, no one jumped out of these two major camps. Although the chairman of the afternoon's session, Zhang Qishu, repeatedly reminded everyone to first discuss the temporary provisions authorizing the President and the term of the temporary National Assembly, it was still ineffective. In the morning, the most vocal opponent of amending the Constitution, and the most methodical speaker, was Cheng Wenxi. He said, "In the past, I opposed it, now I oppose it, and in the future, I will still oppose it." This kind of strong and affirmative sentence caused some resentment. Although it was only a few words, it caused an uproar in the venue. After he calmed down, he said: The reasons for opposing the amendment of the Constitution are, first, we respect Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings; second, the Constitution has already determined Chairman Chiang's position; third, the spirit of the constitutions of European and American countries has already been included. Secondly, he pointed out that the most powerful public opinion at present also does not advocate amending the Constitution. For example, Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Kuomintang, does not advocate amending the Constitution, because the current task is to suppress the rebellion. The Min[she] and Qing[nian] parties have also issued statements before and after, not advocating amending the Constitution. Moreover, this Constitution is a good medicine for saving China, and it is to lead China on the road to democracy, and it has been well received internationally, so it is not advocated to amend it. Zhou Lisheng criticized this Constitution, saying that there are too many loopholes. Not only is the National Assembly part, but also the government part, saying that three powers are not three powers, saying that five powers are not five powers. The cabinet system is not like it, and the presidential system is not like it either. On the contrary, the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan have taken away the power of the National Assembly.

Those who advocate protecting the Constitution and not amending it mostly bring up the dignity of the Constitution, which seems to be unbreakable and cannot be easily shaken. Most of these people belong to the Kuomintang's friendly parties, that is, the Min[zhu Shehui] Party and the Youth Party. Their biggest motivation for disagreeing with the amendment of the Constitution is that the formulation of this Constitution was the result of very hard consultations among the three parties. If it is suddenly amended today, it is said that their original opinions and spirit in participating in the Constitution will lose their vitality, so no matter from which angle they say it, they do not agree to amend it. Although this Constitution does not meet their ideal, they would rather keep it unchanged.

Most of those who advocate amending the Constitution are members of the Kuomintang, because in the history of constitution-making, they did not start from the National Assembly for Constitution-Making, which opened in November of the 35th year of the Republic. They have a long history and a traditional and consistent spirit. They are not willing to destroy the original consistent spirit.

However, what we see in the venue today is a real battle. In fact, a powerful undercurrent is lurking. What is this? It is politics, politics, politics. Chairman Chiang is thinking about the future of the country and the people, abandoning all prejudices, and repeatedly advising Kuomintang members to cooperate sincerely with friendly parties under the major premise, and not to amend the Constitution. However, when some members believe that it is necessary to amend it from a legal point of view, they will inevitably break through this powerful undercurrent and manifest it on the surface. This is the open and secret struggle in the venue all day today. As the saying goes, Minister Gu Zhenggang said well, we (referring to the Kuomintang and the Min[zhu Qingnian] parties) have stood on the anti-communist front and are working together to complete the suppression of the bandits. Yes, we have to admit that everyone has not forgotten or abandoned the real enemy.

In today's venue, we were given a scene of political disputes from the beginning, although that was only a very small beginning. Originally, the chairman and convener today was Zhang Zhiben, but the voices of opposition were very loud, and the order of the venue was completely disrupted for a time. The leaders of the three parties present at the time immediately conducted consultations, and then Chen Bulei explained to the Kuomintang members, Yu Jia[ju] warned the Qingnian Party members, and Xu Fulin persuaded the Min[zhu Shehui] Party members, unanimously explaining that there was no need to act emotionally and turn small things into big things. This scene of sharp angularization was actually able to calm down from the noisy venue immediately, and continue to elect Chairman Zhang Zhiben, calmly and without incident. A strong atmosphere of fire and a strong political atmosphere unfolded in the venue, but "suppressing the communists is our biggest task at present" is a consensus reached by the three parties.

### Philippine President Roxas Dies of Illness Sudden Death from a Heart Attack, Still Criticizing Communism Before His Death Vice President Quirino Will Be Promoted to President

[United Press, Manila, 16th] Philippine President Roxas died suddenly last night of a heart attack at Clark Air Base, a US Air Force base fifty miles northwest of Manila, at the age of 56. Before his sudden death, he delivered a fierce speech criticizing communism. The heart attack occurred at 2:30 PM and he died at 10:10 PM despite treatment. The President's Office announced the death this morning, and the body is being transported back to Manila by special car. Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino, 52 years old, will be promoted to President according to law. Mr. Quirino is currently on a boat vacation in the central Philippines and received the wireless report of the President's death near Cebu. After Roxas's illness, American military doctors, together with the famous Philippine doctor Ferrerimas, used oxygen to try to rescue him. The President's personal physician Xue Song also rushed from Manila by plane. The President's wife and mother also rushed to the airport. The President died in the dormitory of the Commander of the Thirteenth Air Force of the United States, Oponk, with his family by his side. Although Roxas's death was unexpected, he had been suffering from heart disease for many years. When he was Minister of Foreign Affairs during the Japanese occupation, he feigned illness to avoid various unpleasant tasks. Last year, he was shot at in a public speech and escaped unscathed. One person died in his place and six people were injured. He fell ill during the campaign movement in November, and rested for a long time. Last night on the third star, Mr. Roxas celebrated the birthday of American Ambassador O'Neill and his own 27th wedding anniversary at the Presidential Palace until after midnight. This morning, Mr. Roxas took the train to Clark Air Base to review the US Air Force's maneuvers and gave a speech to 500 US military officers and Philippine dignitaries, and the audience cheered like thunder. His warning was, "The nations of the world that love freedom do not want war, but when the situation deteriorates to the extreme, they will have to fight to defend freedom." A few minutes after the speech, the old disease recurred, and the scheduled infantry review program was temporarily canceled.

[Associated Press, Manila, 16th] After Roxas's death, it is expected that Vice President Quirino will be sworn in as President of the Philippines on the morning of the 17th. Mr. Quirino has decided to convene a cabinet meeting at 9:00 AM on the morning of the same day to mourn Roxas.

[United Press, Manila, 16th] The new President Quirino is expected to return to Beijing tonight in a hurry.

[Associated Press, Manila, 16th] The body of Philippine President Roxas arrived at Toto Ben train station on the 16th in the President's special car, and thousands of people came to greet him. Several Philippine P-52 fighters led the vanguard from afar, and the President's body was transported directly to Malacañang Palace (Presidential Palace). Roxas's death was officially announced by the Presidential Palace in a formal announcement issued at 2:00 AM on the 16th.

[United Press, Manila, 16th] A column of soldiers carried the body of the late President Roxas to this shocked and saddened capital today, with the body only covered by the national flag. Mrs. Roxas was inconsolable and was helped off the car by Senate Speaker Avellino and supported into the car by her beloved daughter Lupe. At that time, the crowd was crowded near the station, and the police and the President's guards prevented the audience from approaching the moon. The body was carried into the ambulance by the guards, and the military band played elegies and the national anthem. Mrs. Roxas stepped forward, lifted the national flag and kissed her husband's forehead. The honor guard then began to march slowly towards Malacañang Presidential Palace.

A Brief History of Roxas

Philippine President Roxas was an American-style figure, born in 1892 in Capiz, the capital of Panay Island in the central Philippines. His father was executed for participating in the anti-Spanish revolution, a family tragedy he experienced in his childhood.

From 1900, the United States began to spread American education in the Philippines, and Roxas was among the first generation to receive such education. He initially studied at a public school in his town, then entered Manila High School, and in 1917 entered the University of the Philippines, majoring in law. Roxas excelled in school, and with the guidance and encouragement of his teachers, he was inspired to become a leader of the people. Under the influence of his American teachers, he not only learned academically but also gained American democratic ideals.

From 1913 to 1917, he worked in the Office of the Solicitor General of the Philippines. In 1922, he was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, a position he held until he resigned in 1934. Although Roxas played a secondary role on the Philippine political stage at that time, former President Quezon had already recognized him as the most ideal successor.

In 1946, Roxas defeated Osmeña in the election and was elected President. On July 4 of that year, the Republic of the Philippines was formally established, and Roxas became the first president of the country.

Roxas was familiar with the United States, even more so than some Americans. In the past, as the head of the independent mission, he visited the United States several times, spoke in Congress, broadcast to Americans, and left Americans with a deep and good impression. In the history of Philippine independence, Roxas stands alongside Quezon and Osmeña as one of the three great figures. Therefore, the death of Roxas is not only a loss for the Philippine people but also a major loss for the Far East Pacific region. (This newspaper's data room)

### Results of Drawing for Type A Charity Housing Lottery Released; Winners Begin Exchanging for Certificates Today; Total Ticket Sales Exceed 170 Billion

[Report from this newspaper] The drawing for the Type A Charity Housing Lottery for Winter Relief was held at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road. Attending officials included Mayor Wu, Wang Xianqing, and Yuan Wenzhang. Supervisors included Wang Shiwei, representative of the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office, Huang Liang, Chief Prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Wang Guanqing, representative of the Municipal Government, Xiang Changquan, representative of the Municipal Council, and Xi Yushu, representative of the Municipal Association. More citizens from all walks of life went to watch than during the drawing of the Type B Lottery, estimated at about 3,000 people.

The drawing machine was still the same one used for the Type B Lottery drawing, borrowed from the Central Savings Society. The drawing method was also the same as last time, using three lottery balls. The first ball, Ball C, contained five characters such as "Heaven Earth Element Yellow." The second ball, Ball B, contained twelve numbers from 00 to 11, representing the first two digits of the charity lottery ticket number. The third ball, Ball A, contained 1,000 numbers from 000 to 999, representing the last three digits of the charity lottery ticket number. The result of combining the three balls after they were drawn was the winning number.

Three Improvements to Drawing Procedure

However, because some citizens wrote to Mayor Wu after the Type B Lottery drawing, pointing out that several procedures were not perfect, three reporters were temporarily invited yesterday to draw the balls and make separate improvements to demonstrate sincerity: (1) Some people thought that the numbers drawn were only reported by the Winter Relief Association staff, which could lead to errors or other situations. Yesterday, the drawn character ball numbers were reviewed by the supervisors and news reporters. (2) Some people suspected that the weights of the character balls were not the same. Yesterday, a small scale was specially prepared to test the weight, and it was confirmed on the spot that the weights were the same. (3) Some people were afraid of reading the numbers backwards. Yesterday, a line was added under the numbers on the number balls to avoid reading them backwards.

Mayor Reports No Deception of the Public

At the beginning of the drawing procedure, Mayor Wu reported the above improvement measures and said: "Most of the winners of the Type B Lottery have registered, and they have no connection with the Winter Relief Association. This shows that there is no wrongdoing. My work and the government's work must establish credibility with the public, and we will never deceive the public." Then, Director-General Wang Xianqing reported that all Type A tickets had been sold. As of 12:00 noon, 119.9518 billion yuan had been received for the tickets, and 48.2 million yuan had not been received. 500,469 Type B tickets were sold, and 50.4169 billion yuan was received for the tickets. The total amount of ticket sales was 170.4169 billion yuan. 1,198 Type A reservation vouchers had not been exchanged, totaling 59.6 million yuan. 927 Type B reservation vouchers had not been exchanged, totaling 92.7 million yuan. The total revenue from charity lottery tickets and reservation vouchers was 170.5692 billion yuan.

After the report, the supervisors inspected the lottery balls and number balls. Regarding the weight of the number balls, Wang Shiwei of the Supervisory Commissioner's Office and Huang Liang of the District Prosecutor's Office and others selected several balls for testing, and they were all found to be equal. The mayor then asked Prosecutor Huang to report to the audience in front of the microphone. Before Huang had time to consider his words, he said, "It's probably very accurate." Someone in the stands shouted, "The word 'probably' is inappropriate." Huang quickly explained and at the same time asked Zhu Jie, a representative from the audience, to personally test the weight in front of the drawing table, confirming that the weights were equal, and the public's doubts were dispelled. After the inspection was completed, the drawing began. Mayor Wu personally drew the first winning number, which was the character "Hong" and the number 1034.

### Annular Eclipse on the 9th, Daylight Like Dusk, Chinese and American Experts Go to Mogan Mountain to Prepare for Observation

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The solar eclipse on May 9th this year, as determined by the Academia Sinica and the Astronomical Observatory, is a type of "annular solar eclipse." This type of annular solar eclipse is different from a partial solar eclipse. At that time, as viewed from Earth, the moon will obscure the center of the sun, leaving only a ring visible. The circular portion seen in Shanghai will be slightly less than 10 percent of the sun, so at that time it will not be as dark as night, but only like a hazy dusk. The annular eclipse in this city will last from 8:45 AM to 12:06 PM. Other places in our country that can see it are Haimen, Wujiang in Jiangsu, Changshan, Deqing in Zhejiang, Xingguo, Zixi in Jiangxi, Suixi, Deqing, Wengyuan in Guangdong, etc. However, the visibility and time of the annular eclipse will vary in each location. A certain American university has joined with the Academia Sinica to send experts to the Mogan Mountain area in Wukang County, Zhejiang Province, to make large-scale observation preparations. They intend to take advantage of this solar eclipse to observe longitude detached from the earth's axis. In the future, after precise calculations and several repeated measurements, they can clarify the error rate of the longitude obtained in the past based on the geocentric theory, and make the most accurate correction.

### Returnees from Sakhalin Without Land to Cultivate, Taiwan Provincial Government Sends Telegram Declining, Social Bureau to Discuss Solutions

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Ninety-eight returnees from Sakhalin Island were originally scheduled to go to Taiwan on the 20th of this month for land reclamation and had negotiated a free transportation with China Revival Shipping Company. Yesterday, the Taiwan Provincial Government sent a telegram declining the offer. The telegram stated that among the returnees, there are 56 young children and 14 women, who have no ability to cultivate land. The remaining 28 men are mostly engaged in industry and commerce, and none of them have any experience in land reclamation. It was found that the returnees are from Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shandong, and have no relatives to rely on in Taiwan. Their language is not understood and their customs are different. Moreover, there are unemployed compatriots in the province waiting for solutions. It is very difficult for this group of returnees to make a living in Taiwan. Before a solution is agreed upon, please do not come to Taiwan, etc. The group of returnees is currently residing at the Taiwan Association in Shanghai on Wujin Road. Whether they will still go to Taiwan or seek a living elsewhere will be discussed by the Municipal Social Bureau and other relevant agencies.

### Second Officer of Wanli Ship Rescued and Arrives in Shanghai, Passengers and Crew Awaiting Assistance in Rongcheng

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Wanli ship of Fumin Shipping Company sank after striking a reef near Beisheng Mountain. It has been five days since the incident. The whereabouts of the passengers and crew after landing are still not certain. Yesterday morning, the company chartered a plane and sent employees Yang Dechuan and Li Manzhen, accompanied by nine family representatives, to Qingdao and Yantai to find a way to rescue the passengers and crew from danger. Yesterday evening, the company stated that those who went to Qingjin had safely arrived at their destination. In order to facilitate inquiries from the families of the victims, the company has opened a separate room specifically for inquiries and rest for the families, and will announce news at any time.

Need to Take a Ship Back to Shanghai in Two More Days

It continued: Yesterday afternoon, a telegram was received from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zizhong ship, which stated: "The Zizhong ship passed near the reef where the Wanli ship ran aground near Shengshan Cape at 9 am this morning (i.e., yesterday morning). A fishing boat called for help. It was identified as the Second Officer of the Wanli ship, Ai Huazhong, boarded the ship. According to the report, all 1,230 passengers and crew of the Wanli ship landed ashore. The passengers are temporarily staying in Rongcheng County, and the crew are temporarily staying in Longxu Village in Rongcheng Bay, where they are being entertained by local residents. However, the passengers' luggage and the identities of the soldiers must be verified before they can be released. It will take about two more days to take a boat back to Shanghai. This ship (Zizhong ship's own statement) should not stay for too long. Second Officer Ai instructed this ship to return to Shanghai, report first, and ask to notify each ship to pay attention to fishing boats when passing through that area (i.e., the area where the Wanli ship ran aground). The attached telegram hopes to be forwarded to Fumin Company, Captain Wu Mao Xian." It was found that the Zizhong ship returned to Shanghai from Huludao and is expected to arrive in port tomorrow morning.

Captain and Second Officer Take a Ship to Qingdao

According to a telegram from Second Officer Ai from the Zizhong ship, Captain Sha Yunren and Second Officer Ling took a sailboat to Qingdao on the night of the 15th to transfer to Shanghai. Please send a merchant ship to pick them up. All passengers and crew are safe.

According to the person in charge of the company, the Changcheng ship has already arrived in Tianjin. The company staff and passenger families who went to Tianjin from Shanghai on the 16th will take the Changcheng ship from Tianjin to Yantai, and then transfer to Rongcheng to pick up the passengers and employees of the Wanli ship who were in distress. As for the Wanli ship, it may not be possible to rescue it in the short term.

Recently, they can be successively sent to the National Army's controlled area, of which Yantai is the most likely.

### Standard for Spring Business Tax, Still Levied According to the Old Tax Rate

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The business tax rate was revised by the government in November last year, and it was restored to the method before October 1945. Three percent is levied on those who use the total business income as the standard for taxation, and six percent is levied on those who use the total business profit as the standard for taxation. The Municipal Council believes that at a time when industry and commerce are declining, the implementation of this revised tax rate would increase the burden on various industries and businesses. It requested the Ministry of Finance to maintain the original tax rate, but the Ministry of Finance did not approve it. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Municipal Finance Bureau told reporters: Although the request of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to maintain the original tax rate was not approved by the central government, the spring business tax in this city in 1948 will be levied at the old tax rate of 1.5% and 4%.

### Extortion Case Beyond Xu Jizhuang's Case: Peng Bingcheng, Former General Manager of Far Ocean Company, Suspected of Managing Gold and Currency

[Central News Agency] The military authorities in this city recently received a confidential report of an unprecedented major operation of managing black market gold and US dollars, involving wealthy capital. After days of investigation, they have obtained conclusive evidence. It is reported that the black market gold note operator is the Far Ocean Trading Company in the Hamilton Building. Peng Bingcheng, the former general manager of the company, was imprisoned for being related to the Xu Jizhuang corruption case. Now, someone has filed a complaint with the military authorities with strong evidence, accusing the company of operating a huge amount of black market buying and selling of gold and foreign currency during Peng Bingcheng's tenure. On July 19, 1947, alone, the amount of black market gold involved reached approximately 10,000 taels, and there were also some US dollars and Hong Kong dollars, which is shocking. The military authorities in this city believe that this case is not only a case outside of Peng Bingcheng and Xu Jizhuang, but also involves a senior government official, and are asking the superiors for instructions on how to handle it.

### National Bank Agrees to Settle Foreign Exchange for Fuel Needed by Public Utilities First, Research on Metal and Living Index Issues Will Be Discussed

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Municipal Council resolved to telegraph the Executive Yuan to consider stopping the continued application of the public utilities price calculation formula due to the drastic increase in public utilities prices, restoring the subsidy policy, and requesting that this formula be suspended from application starting in May before the central government decides on an appropriate method. Yesterday, Mayor Wu told reporters: The public utilities price calculation formula itself is not bad. The problem lies in the drastic fluctuations in foreign exchange. He is now trying to negotiate with President Zhang of the National Bank on foreign exchange needed for raw materials for public utilities, and asking for approval to settle foreign exchange one and a half to two months in advance to prevent price increases. President Zhang has agreed to this principle in principle.

[Also Reported] In order to stabilize the prices of public utilities, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau convened representatives of various power companies a few days ago to exchange preliminary views. The representatives believe that in order to stabilize prices, it is only possible to reduce costs and adopt indirect subsidy methods. Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau visited President Zhang at 11:00 am yesterday. After the meeting, President Zhang agreed to allow the settlement of foreign exchange for fuel oil needed by public utilities in this city one and a half months in advance. In addition, the Fuel Management Committee can also sell more than 10,000 tons of coal for public utilities to use first. According to Director Zhao's analysis to reporters, the biggest factors affecting the prices of public utilities, in addition to oil and coal, are the cost of living index and the metal index. Among them, the cost of living index accounts for as much as 42% to 60% of the cost of each company. Therefore, in order to stabilize the cost of living index, all parties need to take the same steps to achieve results. In addition to oil and coal, the metal index issue will be studied in detail with people familiar with the metal industry, and the cost of living index will also be exchanged with relevant agencies to strive for stability. As for the issue of freezing the sales price of public utilities in May, from the standpoint of the Public Utilities Bureau, it will make its best efforts to reduce it to reduce the burden on citizens.

### Highway Joint Transportation Prices Increased Yesterday

Luggage freight is charged at 40% of the ticket price per 5 kilograms.

(3) The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall be adjusted every six months, starting from March 1948.

### Yan Huiyu and Lu Zidong Not Prosecuted for Alleged Embezzlement

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Yan Huiyu, the managing director of Jiangsu Provincial Bank, and Lu Zidong, a former senior employee of Jin Cheng Bank, were reported by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Council for selling more than 10,000 shares of Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory stocks owned by the bank without authorization during the Anti-Japanese War. The District Prosecutor's Office of this city investigated the case and sent letters to relevant agencies for inquiries. However, because of the long time that has passed, there have been no definite responses. Prosecutor Xu Dingwei believes that the crime of embezzlement and malfeasance alleged against the defendants is insufficient, and yesterday decided not to prosecute.

### Cooperative Guidance Meeting Resolves to Form Cooperative Enterprise Inspection Team

The meeting then passed the meeting rules and discussed proposals, and resolved to organize a Shanghai Cooperative Enterprise Inspection Team, with representatives from each unit participating in the guidance meeting as team members.

### Verdict in the Tongji University Student Uprising Case: Eight Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment, Lenient Sentences Given Considering Young Students; Feng Liwen and Two Others Declared Not Guilty

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Tongji University student uprising, a case involving assault and humiliation of Mayor Wu, which caused a great stir, was pronounced in court yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Judge Hu Zhichao entered the Second Criminal Court and had the defendants brought from the detention center. Judge Hu stood and read the main text of the verdict: "Huang Kelu and Pan Chengbang, as joint masterminds, are each sentenced to six months of imprisonment for publicly gathering a crowd to use violence and coercion. Sun Kezi and Qu Yuping, jointly and publicly gathered a crowd to implement violence and coercion, each sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, and Zhou Yongzhi, were jointly present at the scene to assist in the public gathering to use violence and coercion, each sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Feng Liwen, Xiong Zonglie, and Wang Gongwei are all found not guilty." He then sat down and said: "Regarding Pan Chengbang, Tongji University stated that Pan was excellent in character and academics while at the school, and that the student was Shanghai's volleyball representative for the current National Games. He is permitted to be released on bail. Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, and Zhou Yongzhi, the four defendants whose detention period has exceeded their sentences, are therefore permitted to be released on bail or placed under supervision outside of custody. Feng Liwen, Xiong Zonglie, and Wang Gongwei are permitted to be released on bail or placed under supervision outside of custody. The remaining Gong Kelu, Sun Kezi, and Qu Yuping are to remain in custody." Excerpts of the reasoning behind the verdict in this case are as follows:

(1) Huang Kelu and Pan Chengbang:

Defendant Huang Kelu is a standing committee member of the Tongji University Student Union and a member of the presidium. Defendant Pan Chengbang is a standing director of the union, also a member of the presidium, and jointly served with Huang Kelu as chairman of the petition group. Both have admitted this in court. The petition on January 29 was led by the presidium, so the students' advance and retreat must have been orchestrated by the presidium. This is further clarified by Wu Hong's statement at the police station that "charging out of the school gate was ordered by the presidium" (see page 40 of the investigation volume). Although this petition originated from a resolution by representatives of various departments, which was delegated to the presidium for execution, it cannot be considered to have originated from the defendants' incitement. However, knowing that the military police were heavily surrounding and preventing advancement, they still ordered a charge, thereby disrupting order at the time and place. They should jointly bear the responsibility as masterminds of publicly gathering a crowd to use violence and coercion, and are convicted under the latter part of Article 150 of the Criminal Law. In addition to masterminding the disruption of order, Defendant Shen Chengbang also implemented violence, as confirmed by Zhu Yifu in both the investigation and trial. As the mastermind who also implemented violence, he should be sentenced as the mastermind. However, the defendants are all young students who acted on a moment of emotional impulse, so the sentences are lenient.

(2) Sun Kezi and Qu Yuping:

Huang Kelu stated at the police station, "It is a fact that the mayor was beaten." Defendant Sun Kezi crossed the ditch to beat the mayor, which Zhu Yifu not only clearly testified to, but Defendant Sun Kezi also stated to the police when asked, "When the police arrested and photographed students, did you loudly question the mayor in a fierce manner, ignoring objections?" He replied, "Yes, this was disrespectful to the mayor, and I now admit I was wrong." He also admitted in the trial to "speaking impolitely." By comparing and corroborating these statements, it can be generally seen that he used violence. Defendant Qu Yuping also physically assaulted Mayor Wu, as testified by Zhang Jugong in both the investigation and trial, which he cannot deny. Considering the two defendants' actions, they were not solely aimed at obstructing official duties but implemented violence. However, since they publicly gathered a large number of people with the potential for further increase, they met the conditions for publicly gathering a crowd under the Criminal Law. Furthermore, they disobeyed the orders of the local administrative head to disperse and instead surged forward together to implement violence, clearly intending to disrupt order at the time, which aligns with the latter part of Article 150 of the Criminal Law. They are therefore convicted of disrupting order, and considering that the defendants are young first-time offenders, the sentences are also lenient.

(3) Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, and Zhou Yongzhi:

A. Although Defendant Wang Zongshu was not a leader of the petition group, even if it cannot be proven how he implemented violence, his presence at the scene to assist is beyond doubt.

B. Defendant Wang Weixin was the general commander of the petition group, as he admitted in court and was confirmed by Zhou Zhiyu. Although it cannot be proven how he implemented violence or coercion, his presence at the scene to assist is also beyond doubt.

C. Defendant Zhang Jingyao admitted at the police station that he held a petition flag and charged towards the surrounding police officers and was arrested at the time. Although this cannot immediately be considered implementing violence, he cannot evade responsibility for assisting at the scene.

D. Defendant Zhou Yongzhi admitted that he was standing by the ditch in front of the third team, and Zhu Yifu stated that he charged across the ditch. Therefore, his presence at the scene to assist is hardly doubtful.

In summary, the four defendants should be convicted under the first part of Article 150 of the Criminal Law. However, their criminal motive was a moment of emotional impulse, and they are young students. The sentences should be lenient to show leniency.

(4) Feng Liwen, Xiong Zonglie, and Wang Gongwei:

After Mayor Wu proposed a five-person meeting for mediation, Defendant Feng Liwen went to invite alumnus Huang Bosun, and chaos erupted when he held Huang Bosun's business card and read it aloud to the group. Therefore, it can be generally seen that he did not participate in the presidium's planning of the charge, so he should be declared not guilty. Although Defendant Xiong Zonglie shouted the slogan "Students, don't be discouraged," it is said that he shouted it afterward at night in the classroom on the second floor, so it is difficult to immediately convict him. Although Hu Liping, a student from Guangfu Middle School, testified during the investigation that Defendant Wang Gongwei beat the mayor, Tongji University students Du Chenglang and Li Dabing unanimously testified that Wang Gongwei was in front of the kitchen door at the time of the conflict. Zhu Yifu also stated in court, "I didn't see Wang Gongwei," and Zhang Jugong solemnly stated, "The one named Wang with the blind left eye did not beat the mayor. I didn't say he beat the mayor." Zhu and Zhang were always beside Mayor Wu that day and their observations are more reliable. Therefore, their testimonies are more credible than Hu Liping's. Thus, he is also declared not guilty. Based on the above reasoning, in conjunction with Article 291, the first part of Article 292, and Article 293, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 28 and Article 150 of the Criminal Law, the verdict is as stated in the main text.

### Jiaotong University Students Disciplined by School for Involvement

### Rising Production Prices Boost Confidence, Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Flour Rises, Mixed Grains Mostly Up, Few Down

### Sugar Market Initially Firm, Then Weak

The sugar market yesterday advanced and then retreated. It opened with a low disk, with the 16th period coarse sugar warehouse order, for delivery the day after tomorrow, adding only 480,000 yuan. Then, rumors suddenly spread that foreign exchange was about to rise, and the market rose in a frenzy, adding up to 570,000 yuan. The period for next week added 700,000 yuan. Ultimately, the rumors proved to be unfounded, and confidence softened again, with prices gradually declining. Later dates still added 500,000 yuan, to 4.94 million yuan, the same as yesterday's settlement. Next week's period is estimated to add 600,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Quiet

Prices also fluctuated as before. As for export varieties, only green tea destined for North Africa saw activity as exporters continued to make up for shortages. However, pricing did not increase due to the condition of the goods and generally presented a steady-to-slightly bullish tone.

### Chinese Farmers Bank to Provide Loans for Chemical Fertilizers

[Reported by This Newspaper] Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry entrusted the Chinese Farmers Bank with the continuous lending of 85,000 tons of chemical fertilizers transported from the United States to various regions. The trial application proved to be highly effective. This year, the bank has ordered 20,000 tons of this fertilizer from the United States, the first batch of which will arrive in Shanghai on the 27th of this month, with the rest arriving by the end of the month. Physical loans will be provided at that time. It is estimated that each jin of fertilizer can increase rice production by three jin. If the principle of recovering two jin of rice for each jin of fertilizer loaned is followed, farmers can still earn one jin of profit. This measure is beneficial for encouraging increased production and for the government to control materials.

### Unsettled Situation, Shanghai Stocks Rise and Fall Slightly

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was dominated by short-term players, and the situation was unsettled and very volatile. Hong Kong Electric saw contractions, and price speculation was endless, easily reversing the trend. The results were both very slight increases and declines.

Initially, the market was weak due to the issuance of treasury bills and tight money in banks. Wing On Textile debuted at 1810 yuan, retreated to a low of 1745 yuan, and 145 and others bought at the low. External stimulus then arose, and foreign stocks rose again, rebounding to 1816 yuan. Due to many sellers, it retreated to 1790 yuan, then advanced again to 1840 yuan. Around noon, due to insufficient support from the bulls, the midday close was 1797 yuan.

Baisha opened in the morning at 2.58 million, rose from 2.57 million to 2.65 million, and then slightly declined. In the afternoon, there was less support, and the market closed around 2.56 million.

### Shanghai Yarn Control Office Signs Cotton Purchase Contract with Hubei Cotton Merchants, Commissioning Purchase of 200,000 Dan to Be Delivered in Three Months

[Reported by This Newspaper] The yarn control office and the Hubei cotton merchant's cotton purchase contract was officially signed yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm in the meeting room of the yarn control office. Yuan, Chairman of the Yarn Control Office, and the heads of various related departments, and Cheng Shiju, representatives of Hubei cotton merchants, and 10 others were present at the time. First, Pan Jianliang, Director of the Procurement and Transportation Department of the Yarn Control Office, officially read the original text of the contract. The main points of the contract were that the commissioned purchase quantity was tentatively set at 300,000 market dan, for a period of three months, starting from May to July; divided into 100,000 dan in May, 150,000 dan in June, and 50,000 dan in July. If completed ahead of schedule within the time limit, the association will reward it. If it cannot proceed according to the scheduled progress, it will be deducted from the guaranteed cotton. However, special difficulties will be regarded as exceptions. Then, after Chairman Yuan inquired whether there were any objections, both parties signed and sealed. At this point, Chairman Yuan delivered a speech to the representatives of the cotton merchants signing the contract, raising three points: (1) Hope to work hard to complete the responsibilities stipulated in the contract. (2) Hope that everyone will not harm the public for private gain during the purchase and transportation period. (3) Do not use tricks on cotton farmers, and strive for reasonable cotton collection procedures. The cotton merchant representatives also raised three points of hope: 1. The revolving funds should be allocated quickly, 2. The delivery and weighing procedures should be simple, 3. Overcome transportation difficulties. At the same time, I hope that the Yarn Control Committee will treat the commissioned purchase units equally if there are supplementary clauses. Chairman Yuan then stated that he would negotiate improvements at any time.

### Improved Sales, Slightly Increased Buying Interest, Most Cotton Yarn and Cloth Recovered

Yesterday's yarn market was steady and firm. Rumors that foreign exchange rates would rise again slightly increased interest from all parties. 21-count Double Horse opened in the morning and broke through the 141 million yuan mark, opening from 141.1 million yuan and once rising to 144 million yuan. With many sellers near closing, there was a slight decline, eventually closing at 143 million yuan, recovering 4 million yuan. Except for 42-count Blue Phoenix falling by 3 million yuan, the rest saw demand and supply matching, with little fluctuation. 32-count various grades of reproduction industries slightly advanced, and market prices mostly recovered between 1 million and 3 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse and other customer sales became smoother, and the local market also purchased, with market prices mostly rising 2 to 3 million yuan. 16-count and 10-count various grades were also firm, up between 1.5 million and 3 million yuan.

Yesterday morning's opening for cotton cloth was stimulated by rumors of foreign exchange rate changes and quickly turned upward. Jiangxi customers made strong advances, and Longtou fine cloth advanced more than 1,000 pieces. Due to turnover issues, dye factories continued to sell at high prices. Retail cloth merchants were hesitant to take action, and buyers and sellers were in a strong standoff. Longtou fine cloth recovered to 4.77 million yuan from 4.88 million yuan. For the remaining lower-grade fine cloths, Hankou merchants made advances, and they were also popular. 190 twill fell 50,000 to 100,000.

Spinning and Construction Sales Yarn

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday (16th), the Spinning and Construction Company opened for sale twelve types of cotton yarn, and the approved selling prices are as follows: 20-count Golden Rooster 127 million yuan, 10-count Liuma 72 million yuan, 16-count Red Moon 94 million yuan, 32-count Xiantao 154 million yuan, 32-count Double Strand Xiantao 174 million yuan, 32-count Double Strand Fengnian 178 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight 174 million yuan, 40-count TK Color Ball 224 million yuan.

A total of 302 purchase orders were received, selling 800 pieces of yarn, equivalent to 1382.5 pieces of 20-count yarn.

Spot Cotton Turns Bullish

Yesterday's spot cotton market situation turned bullish due to the slightly firm yarn market. With the Flower Control Office opening up its wide scale, sellers were eager to sell, and transactions were still being completed. Market prices for various grades were up around 100,000. 400 bales were traded. The delivery price to the public treasury opened at 24.5 million for Jingyang, 23.5 million, Shashi at 21.4 million, and Han fine at 20.4 million. The underwater price opened at 17.4 million for Hai Tip Jian, and the underwater price for Zhoupu seed flower was 4.32 million yuan.

### Hardware Association Requests Changes to the Import Allocation Quota Methods

The Shanghai Hardware Business Association presented a petition to the Trade and Assistance Office of the Import Association yesterday, requesting changes to the import quota allocation method for hardware, on the grounds that it was unfair and increased the costs of production factories. The reasons are copied below:

(1) Under the current system, 50% of the total hardware import quota is allocated to distributors. The allocation method is determined by the individual import firms. In the past, import firms acted as agents, charging commissions, and their legal profits rarely exceeded 10%. Now, they are taking advantage of the import quotas and the foreign exchange provided by the government to transform their business practices. To correct these problems, the following two points should be implemented: (A) Following the example of the Shanghai Industrial Association allocating foreign exchange to factories, the distribution of hardware import quotas to distributors should be collectively discussed and allocated by the relevant trade association of distributors. Import firms should not be allowed to freely allocate the quotas, to fulfill their selfish desires. (B) When import firms act as agents, a legal profit must be stipulated when the government provides foreign exchange. When hardware merchants order from import firms and resell to factory users, a legal profit must also be stipulated.

(2) The current regulations for applying for non-quota imports require factory certification. However, there are many practical difficulties, and even if it is reluctantly implemented, there are still inaccuracies and omissions. For example, for certain tools or accessories required by various factories (such as military knife steel drill bits, grinding wheels, etc.), the sizes are different, the styles are distinct, and the required periods are not always the same. When import firms order from foreign manufacturers, they cannot order less than dozens or hundreds of pieces. It is impossible to jointly sign an order with each factory. If one factory signs the order, it is inevitable that falsehoods will be fabricated, and abuses will occur. Especially when needs arise in other cities and rural areas, it is easy to miss the opportunity, resulting in abnormal supply of imported materials. To resolve these difficulties and ensure a smooth supply of materials, we propose to change the method to allow members of the association to directly apply for commercial association certification, which is more reasonable and practical.

### International Friendship Competition to Be Held During the National Games, Adding Ball Sports Events Besides Athletics, Inviting Foreign Nationals in China to Participate

Two months ago, the U.S. Navy stationed in Shanghai learned that China's 7th National Games would be held on May 5th and sent a letter to the two National Games Organizing Committees requesting permission to send representatives to participate in the competition. This matter was discussed at the second meeting of the National Games Organizing Committee, and it was decided that on the sixth day after the opening of the National Games, time would be set aside to hold an international friendly competition, with representatives from both Chinese and Western sides responsible for preparation. The enemy committee has now been formed, with nine members, and held its first committee meeting at the U.S. Navy Club at the racecourse yesterday. Hao Boyang was elected as chairman, Kaiji Miluofu (head of the Western Youth Sports Department) as vice chairman, and Quelibote as secretary. It was decided that a notice would be issued immediately inviting foreign nationals in China to participate in the competition, and a deadline would be set for reporting the number of participants and events to the committee. (Note: The international friendly competition was originally only for athletics. Now, ball sports competitions will be added.) The committee is scheduled to hold a second meeting next Tuesday (20th).

National Games Venue Renovations Completed

It is also reported that most of the National Games venue has been renovated. Further steps are now being taken to organize the environment and traffic outside the venue, and evergreen trees are being planted. The front of the venue is painted in autumn incense color, restoring the heroic appearance of the 6th National Games. However, the six large characters "Shanghai Municipal Sports Ground" on the horizontal plaque above the gate have not yet been written. It was originally intended to ask Mayor Wu to write them himself. However, Wu believes that the construction of the year-round sports ground was entirely due to the efforts of former Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and the original inscription was also written by Wu Tiecheng himself. Therefore, now that it has been renovated again, these six characters should still be written by Wu Tiecheng to commemorate his achievements and to make a memory of this event. Therefore, the Municipal Works Bureau has sent a letter to Wu requesting him to write them. Once it is received, the entire project can be completed with the addition of paint.

### Feng Jingxiang Gives Way to Wu Qixiang - Hu Hao Asks for Wang Xinheng's Understanding

Since the announcement of the national football team's roster for the World Games, there has been widespread dissatisfaction with the omission of domestic right-back Wu Qixiang. The media has been unanimously critical of Hu Hao, a member of the selection committee. Yesterday, Hu Hao sent a letter to Shen Qiuyan, director of the China East News Agency in this city, to defend himself and ask Wang Xinheng of the Qingbai Sports Association for understanding. He stated that Xingdao was willing to give up a spot on the team to allow Wu Qixiang to be selected. The original letter stated: "During the selection of football players for the World Games, I specifically nominated Wu Qixiang, but it was not approved by the other members present. Fei Chunhua also nominated him, but with the same result. All of this was witnessed by Wang Rong, Li Mo, and others. Afterwards, I even sent a special letter to Brother Xinheng to explain the matter. Now that Mr. Rong Qizhao has returned to Shanghai, my only solution is to have Feng Jingxiang withdraw, creating a vacancy for Wu Qixiang. I can ask Dr. Rong to discuss this in Shanghai. Once the quotas are settled, this matter should be resolved smoothly. That is my intention, and I hope Xinheng can understand."

### Public Funding Changed to Scholarships - Ministry of Education Provides Explanation - Original Publicly Funded Students Receive Funding Until Graduation - Scholarship Students Limited to Those with Excellent Exam Results

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] It is reported that the Ministry of Education recently discussed the issue of rectifying academic standards at the invitation of relevant parties. Our reporter interviewed Tian Peilin, Vice Minister of Education, tonight, who said: The Ministry of Education, due to the National Assembly representatives coming to Nanjing for a meeting, discussed the issue of publicly funded students with the presidents of various universities among the representatives. The system of publicly funded students began during the War of Resistance. It should have been abolished after the victory and repatriation. Last year, the Political Consultative Conference also advocated revising the publicly funded system, which was finalized by the Executive Yuan to be changed to scholarships. Therefore, since August last year, except for normal school students, students returning to school from the Youth Army, and students from the border areas who are stipulated to receive public funding, there is no public funding for others, only scholarships. Existing publicly funded students will continue to receive funding until graduation. In addition, there is a relief fund program for students whose families are in the communist-controlled areas. Scholarships are given until graduation, while relief funds are stopped three months after the student's hometown is recovered. Scholarship students are selected based on excellent exam results. Therefore, freshmen in universities who meet the scholarship requirements can receive scholarships, but it is not as widespread as the previous public funding system. However, because the name of the scholarship quota is similar to the number of publicly funded students before the change, there is a lot of misunderstanding from the outside world, thinking that scholarships are public funding. In the future, the Ministry will formally explain this program to correct the view. Minister Zhu reported on public funding matters to the National Assembly on the 14th, which has been thoroughly explained. Minister Zhu emphasized: No country in the world completely provides university students with food expenses. At a time when compulsory education in China is not yet widespread, it is not only unreasonable to use people's hard-earned money to promote compulsory education in primary schools instead of providing university students with food expenses, but also very unfair!

### On the Name and Translator of the Han Translation of Aśvaghoṣa's Buddhacarita

— Zhou Yiliang

Among the classics recording the life of Śākyamuni, the earliest is the Xiuxing Benqi Jing (修行本起經), translated by Zhu Dali and Kang Mengqun in the Later Han Dynasty. Then there is the Taizi Ruiying Benqi Jing (太子瑞應本起經), translated by Zhi Qian of the Wu Dynasty; the Puyao Jing (普曜經), translated by Zhu Fahu of the Western Jin Dynasty; the Guoqu Xianzai Yinguo Jing (過去現在因果經), translated by Guṇabhadra of the Liu Song Dynasty; the Fo Benxing Ji Jing (佛本行集經), translated by Jñānagupta of the Sui Dynasty; the Fangguang Dazhuangyan Jing (方廣大莊嚴經), translated by Divākara of the Tang Dynasty; and the Zhongxu Mohe Di Jing (衆許摩訶帝經), translated by Dharmadeva of the Zhao Song Dynasty. These classics all narrate in different ways. Some start from the birth of Siddhartha Gautama of the Śākya clan, and some start from the ancestors of the Śākya clan. Still others start from when Śākyamuni was a Brahmin named Shanxian (善憲) in a previous life, and met the Dīpaṃkara Buddha and first generated the Bodhi mind. Yet others start from the opening of heaven and earth. Because the transmissions differ, the contents are mutually different, and each has its place in the study of Buddhist history. However, from a literary point of view, none of the above is considered important. The two most important are the Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經) translated by Sengqiepo of the Liu Song Dynasty and the Buddhacarita, traditionally translated by Dharmarakṣa of the Northern Liang Dynasty. This short essay will discuss the original name and translator of the latter's Han translation.

The Buddhacarita is one of the few Sanskrit originals still extant in the vast sea of Han-translated Buddhist scriptures. Both the Han and Tibetan translations have twenty-eight chapters, but unfortunately only the first half of the original Sanskrit text, fourteen chapters, remains. Strangely, the discovered manuscripts only extend to the middle of the fourteenth chapter, suggesting that the second half was lost long ago. E. B. Cowell's edited version goes up to the seventeenth chapter, but after examination, the latter half of the fourteenth chapter onwards is added by later generations and is not the original of Aśvaghoṣa. The best version now is E. H. Johnston's edition, published as the thirty-first volume of the Punjab University Oriental Publications, with an English translation. In the history of Indian literature, the Buddhacarita belongs to the category of court poetry (Kauys). It is said that such poetry must discuss the principles of governing the country and behaving as a person, describe women, describe battles, and use relatively ornate and decorative phrases. The Buddhacarita successfully achieves all these points. The principles of governing the country and behaving as a person are spoken by Udāyi, as seen in the Liyu Pin (離欲品, Chapter on Detachment). The Ouxi Pin (歐息品, Chapter on Stopping) describes the women rushing to see the prince when he goes out for a trip, and the Liyu Pin describes the various appearances of the palace women sleeping at night when the prince sees them. There are extremely delicate and thorough descriptions of women's clothing, movements, and psychology. However, the Chinese translation omits many of these, probably because it is considered inconsistent with the solemnity of the classics, not knowing that the original Sanskrit text was a "poem" rather than a "sutra." As for the embellishment and ornamentation of phrases, especially the two methods most favored by Indian literati—one is imaginative metaphor, and the other is to use words with the same sound but different meanings to play games—they are even more eye-catching. However, the Han translation is limited by language and cannot express the second point. Regarding the general evaluation of the Buddhacarita, we can quote Yijing's words as a representative. He said that Aśvaghoṣa "also composed the Fo Benxing Shi (佛本行詩, Buddha-conduct Poem), the large version of which, if translated, would be more than ten volumes. It describes the Tathagata from the royal palace to the twin Sala trees. The entire Buddha-dharma of a lifetime is compiled into poetry. No one in the five Indias and the South Sea does not recite it. The meaning is clear, the words are few, and it can capture many meanings. It also makes the reader feel happy and forget fatigue." (Nanhai Jigui Neifa Zhuan 南海寄歸內法傳, Chapter 4, 条讚詠之禮)

After reading Yijing's words, two questions arise. The first is the question of the era of the Han translation of the Buddhacarita. He said, "the large version, if translated, would be more than ten volumes," as if it had not yet been translated into Chinese. However, the Chu Sanzang Ji Ji (出三藏記集) compiled by Sengyou of the Liang Dynasty as early as Volume 2 already recorded it, which is undoubtedly the translated version we see now. Why is it that someone as erudite as Yijing seems not to have seen it? The annotations to Takakusu Junjiro's translation of the Jigui Zhuan and Hirakawa Akira's A Study of Sanskrit Buddha Biography Literature have not answered this question. I think Sengyou's record is naturally credible, or perhaps Yijing did not carry many scriptures with him when he was writing books in the South Sea, so he missed the inspection? Perhaps he was only trying to explain the amount of the book, so he said "if translated"? The second question is more important and more complex, namely the question of the name and translator of the Han translation of the Buddhacarita. Volume 2 of Sengyou's Chu Sanzang Ji Ji has "Fo Suoxing Zan (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds) in five volumes," with a note stating "also named Ma Ming Pusa Zan (馬鳴菩薩讚, Eulogy of Bodhisattva Aśvaghoṣa), or Fo Benxing Zan (佛本行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Conduct)." The translator was Dou Yun of the Liu Song Dynasty. (See also Volume 5, Biography of Baoyun) Volume 4 also has "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in five volumes," in the Lost Translation Miscellaneous Sutras Record, which means the translator is unknown. Volume 2 of Fa Jing's Zhongjing Mulu (衆經目錄) of the Sui Dynasty has "Fo Benxing Zan Jing Zhuan (佛本行讚經傳, Transmission of the Eulogy Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in seven volumes, translated by Baoyun in the Yuanjia years of the Song Dynasty," and also has "Fo Suoxing Zan Jing Zhuan (佛所行讚經傳, Transmission of the Eulogy Sutra of the Buddha's Deeds) in five volumes, also named Ma Ming Zan (馬鳴讚, Eulogy of Aśvaghoṣa), translated by Dou Yun of the Jin Dynasty." Fei Changfang's Lidai Sanbao Ji (歷代三寶記) Volume 9 has "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in five volumes," translated by Dharmarakṣa. Volume 10 has "Fo Suoxing Zan Jing (佛所行讚經, Sutra of the Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds) in five volumes," Dou Yun Chan. Daoxuan's Datang Neidian Lu (大唐內典錄) is the same as the Sanbao Ji. Volume 5 of Mingquan's Dazhou Kanding Zhongjing Mulu (大周刊定衆經目錄) of the Wu Zhou Dynasty in the Mahayana Re-translated Sutras section has "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in one section of five volumes," translated by Dharmarakṣa, and also has "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in one section of seven volumes," translated by Dou Yun. Volume 4 of Zhisheng's Kaiyuan Shijiao Lu (開元釋敎錄) under Dharmarakṣa Translation has "Fo Suoxing Zan Jing Zhuan (佛所行讚經傳, Transmission of the Eulogy Sutra of the Buddha's Deeds) in five volumes." The note says: "Some call it Sutra, without the word Transmission. Some call it Transmission, without the word Sutra. Created by Bodhisattva Aśvaghoṣa. Also called Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct), see Changfang's Record." Volume 5 under Baoyun Translation has "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in seven volumes," with a note saying "Also called Fo Benxing Zan Zhuan (佛本行讚傳, Transmission of the Eulogy of the Buddha's Conduct), appeared at the Liuhe Mountain Temple. Some say five volumes, see Sengyou's Xianchang Neidian (賢唱內典) and other records. The Biographies of Eminent Monks says Fo Benxing Zan Jing (佛本行讚經, Sutra of the Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds)." The names of the scriptures, translators, and number of volumes recorded by various families are mostly different and cannot be investigated. Tokiwa Daijō said in his Complete Record of Sutra Translations from the Later Han to the Song and Qi (page 910): "Sengyou considers Fo Suoxing Zan (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds) to be translated by Baoyun, which seems to be followed. And the one translated by Dharmarakṣa should follow Fei Changfang's saying, which is the Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in Youlu's record." His words are merely speculation and have no evidence.

If we look closely at the words of the various catalogs cited above, we know that the number of volumes is due to errors in the writing of numbers during copying, or due to the paper relationship when writing scriptures, and the number of volumes has increased or decreased. For example, Volume 9 of Lidai Sanbao Ji says "Luoyang Qielan Ji (洛陽伽藍記, Records of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang) in five volumes," and the note says: "Or it is a large volume." Naturally, those who combined it into a large volume may have used smaller characters, or the paper may have been longer. Thus, the same book has a distinction between five volumes and one volume. Also, the Pelliot 342 manuscript collected in Paris (according to the photograph in the Qinghua University Library) is the account book of a temple, and one part is the "Scripture Catalog." Among them are "Miscellaneous Tibetan Scriptures in eight volumes" and "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in six volumes," which are inconsistent with the number of volumes currently transmitted. Generally, it is also based on the actual number of scrolls in the written manuscript and is not the original number of volumes. Therefore, we can temporarily ignore the difference in the number of volumes in the scripture records cited above. The meanings of "Benxing" (本行, Original Conduct) or "Suoxing" (所行, Deeds) in the scripture name are the same, and we can also ignore them. Or calling it "Jing" (經, Sutra) or "Zhuan" (傳, Transmission) is also not in the original text, and the Chinese translation is arbitrarily added, which can be excluded. The most reliable basis for our current reasoning is the existence or absence of the word "Zan" (讚, Eulogy).

The difference between the two scriptures in Fa Jing's catalog is only the difference between the words "Suo" (所) and "Xing" (行), and both are translated by Baoyun. Mingquan's catalog is called "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct)," and says that it and Jñānagupta's Fo Benxing Ji Jing (佛本行集經, Collected Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) are both "different translations of the same version," which can be said to be lying with eyes open! The Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) and the Fo Suoxing Zan (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds) are certainly not the same book, and they have nothing to do with the huge Fo Benxing Ji Jing (佛本行集經, Collected Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct), how can they be called "same version"? Therefore, the records in these two catalogs are not worth discussing. For the sake of clarity, I will list the statements of the remaining four scripture records in the following table:

From the table above, we know that from the Liang Dynasty to the early Tang Dynasty, it was always believed that the one translated by Baoyun was called "Xing Zan" (行讚, Conduct Eulogy), and the other was called "Xing Jing" (行經, Conduct Sutra). I think this earliest statement is correct. In other words, the current "Fo Benxing Jing" (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) should originally be called "Fo Suoxing Zan" (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds), and the "Fo Suoxing Zan" (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds) should be called "Fo Benxing Jing" (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct). What is the reason?

Aśvaghoṣa's poem is originally named Buddhacarita in Sanskrit, which can be translated as "Fo Suoxing (佛所行, Buddha's Deeds)" or "Fo Benxing (佛本行, Buddha's Conduct)," but there is no implication of "Jing" (經, Sutra) or "Zan" (讚, Eulogy) in it. Yijing called it "Fo Benxing Shi (佛本行詩, Buddha-conduct Poem)," which is extremely correct. The Chinese may have added the word "Jing" (經, Sutra) because it is regarded as an internal Buddhist scripture. But there is no reason to call it "Zan" (讚, Eulogy), because the entire article is a biography of Śākyamuni and has no function of "Zan" (讚, Eulogy). Looking at the current version of the Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct), it is very qualified to be called "Zan" (讚, Eulogy). The Inyuan Pin (因綠品, Chapter on Causes and Conditions) at the beginning records that after the Tathagata's Nirvana, the gods asked the Vajra Warrior to recount the Buddha's virtues. The Warrior said: "Wanting to praise the Buddha's merits, no one can exhaust all of them. I wish to inherit the Buddha's divine power, so that my intentions will not be mistaken. I can proclaim a little, praising the Buddha's virtues and goodness." Zan (讚) is like praise. The second chapter is the "Cheng Zan Rulai Pin" (稱讚如來品, Chapter on Praising the Tathagata), briefly describing the Tathagata's deeds. This chapter is about the eight kings dividing the relics, and also says: "At that time, the Secret Trace Warrior widely said this Dharma to the gods and humans, successively explaining the Buddha's original conduct and virtues. ... Even if all the Arhats have wisdom like Śāriputra, praising the Buddha's virtues for kalpas cannot end. Moreover, my wisdom is shallow and limited to what I have seen and heard." Isn't this a thorough "Fo Suoxing Zan" (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds)?

The above proves that the current "Xing Jing" (行經, Conduct Sutra) should originally be called "Xing Zan" (行讚, Conduct Eulogy). Before Daoxuan, this scripture was regarded as translated by Dou Yun, and Zhisheng began to say that it was translated by Dharmarakṣa. With the problem of the scripture name solved, what about the problem of the translator? I think Sengyou's statement should also be regarded as correct. The first is of course because of the adjacency of time and place. Baoyun died in the twenty-sixth year of Yuanjia in the Song Dynasty (449 AD), and Sengyou died in the seventeenth year of Dajian in the Liang Dynasty (518 AD), not long apart. Sengqiepo translated the scriptures in Liuhe, within the territory of the Southern Dynasties. Sengyou should be clear about Baoyun's work. There is also other evidence that the work originally named Xing Zan (行讚, Conduct Eulogy) and now named Xing Jing (行經, Conduct Sutra) was not translated by Dharmarakṣa. The translation of Sanskrit classics is often dictated by the Indian or Western Region translator, and then recorded by others. Because it has gone through this level, it is not easy to examine the translator's personality from the writing style or the words used in the translation. However, the transliteration of proper nouns should be relatively fixed. The same translator should use the same Chinese characters to transliterate the same proper nouns when translating different classics. Now, it seems that all are translated from Sanskrit texts. Compare the transliterations of some proper nouns seen in Baoyun's Xing Jing (寶雲行經, Baoyun's Conduct Sutra) and Dharmarakṣa's Jin Guangming Jing (金光明經, Golden Light Sutra) and Da Ban Niepan Jing (大般涅槃經, Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra), and it will be clear that the Xing Jing (行經, Conduct Sutra) was not written by Dharmarakṣa, and Zhisheng's statement is completely wrong.

Since the current Xing Jing (行經, Conduct Sutra) should originally be called Xing Zan (行讚, Conduct Eulogy) and is known to have been translated by Dou Yun in the Liu Song Dynasty, the problem of the translator of the current Xing Zan (行讚, Conduct Eulogy) is also half solved. It cannot have been written by Baoyun either, because the transliterations of the two are quite different. Take a look at the table below:

Fa Jing and Mingquan believe that both were translated by Dou Yun, which is of course unbelievable. I also think that Fei Changfang and Daoxuan's claim that the current Xing Zan (行讚, Conduct Eulogy) was translated by Dharmarakṣa is highly questionable. The Biographies of Eminent Monks by Huijiao and the Biography of Dharmarakṣa in Sengyou's Chu Sanzang Ji Ji (出三藏記集, Collection of Records Concerning the Tripitaka) on which he based his work record Dharmarakṣa's translations of the Da Ji (大集, Great Collection), Niepan (涅槃, Nirvana) and other scriptures, not to mention the Bei Hua (悲華, Karuṇāpuṇḍarīka Sūtra), Hai Longwang (海龍王, Sāgaranāgarājaparipṛcchā) and other scriptures, but do not mention this work by Aśvaghoṣa. If it was written by Dharmarakṣa, such an important classic should never have been omitted by both. The transliterations of Xing Zan (行讚, Conduct Eulogy), such as "Luohuanluo (羅喚羅)" and "Axiuluo (阿修羅)," do match Dharmarakṣa's other translations. However, there are too few items to serve as a basis. Judging from the tacit proof of Sengyou's and Huijiao's biographies of Dharmarakṣa, we still believe in the Chu Sanzang Ji Ji (出三藏記集, Collection of Records Concerning the Tripitaka), and believe that Aśvaghoṣa's "Fo Benxing Shi (佛本行詩, Buddha-conduct Poem)" is "lost in translation," which is probably the most appropriate.

### Preface to "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden"

— Wu Ling

Mr. Zhang Hanrui brought me his manuscript of "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden" and asked me to write a few words. This is an obligation that cannot be refused.

I carefully read it from beginning to end. This manuscript has two hundred and twenty leaves, with six hundred characters on each half page. In total, the book has more than two hundred and fifty thousand words. The sources of the materials, that is, the books he has consulted and cited, are at least four hundred kinds, many of which are very obscure and rare. This kind of work is much more difficult than Zhang Cixi's compilation of "Historical Materials of the Liyuan Garden in Yandu during the Qing Dynasty" and Zhou Mingtai's hand-copied and printed "Excerpts from the Files of the Qing Shengping Bureau"; because "Historical Materials of the Liyuan Garden in Yandu during the Qing Dynasty" is just a collection of books, and "Excerpts from the Files of the Qing Shengping Bureau" is just a transcription of materials. Although this "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden" is the same as the two books mentioned above, it is so-called burning bricks and tiles rather than building houses, but it requires the most calm patience, the longest time, the most extensive knowledge and the most intelligent choice. I personally have some experience in compiling a catalog of dramas. I often spend many days checking a book, but in the end I can't find a single entry. Sometimes I find it but I can't determine and identify it. This is just like the gold miners on the banks of the Jinsha River, only they truly understand the hardships. Mr. Zhang Hanrui has cited at least four hundred kinds of books in this book, but he may have searched more than a thousand kinds. I say this, and he will definitely understand it well. In fact, gold is transferred from the hands of gold miners to gold shops, and after thousands of hammers and refinements, it adds various solemnity to women. The books made with such great effort are only available to scholars and experts as ready-made materials, allowing them to decorate the feathers of magnificent books. So, why not write it directly yourself? This is why we will always express our gratitude for Mr. Zhang Hanrui's attitude towards work. The more people who devote themselves to cultivation without asking for harvest, and the more people who specialize in learning for others without being selfish or arrogant, the more the future of learning can be envisioned as bright. At the same time, our emphasis on this book also has obvious differences from other similar works. In terms of time, the materials it contains cannot be limited by a certain period or dynasty, but from ancient times to modern times. In terms of space, the scope it determines is not only the dramas of Yongjia and the Zaju of Dadu, but also the materials of the local operas with rich regional characteristics that can be sorted out and outlined as much as possible. The word "Pear Garden" is used in a broad sense: music, dance, songs, and dramas are all counted; in terms of drama, it not only includes the titles of scripts and writers, and the textual research of the content of the works, but also focuses on stage performances and the records of the private lives of actors, which is more obvious than the quhua of the predecessors, and is more serious than the Juju, which specializes in making daily life notes for actors. Jumping out of Wang Guowei's "Yuyulu" and Ren Na's "Xinquyuan" circles, scholars who study folk literature and devote themselves to different directions can choose and use according to their special needs, saving the waste of time searching for books unreasonably.

As for the reason why this book is called "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden", it is because Mr. Zhang Hanrui arranges the materials in the same way as Liu Yiqing's Shishuo Xinyu. It is divided into sixty-three topics in total, that is, Kaoji, Bianzheng, Jiahua, Jiqi, Qianyou, Wunong, Douou, Panduan, Shihuan, Shangmai, Aidao, Xiaoxie, Xuanba, Shifang, Gushi, Jiuzhang, Yanhui, Shangci, Jinge, Tanhe, Chuanshu, Zhengyin, Libie, Tizeng, Huixie, Jidu, Youxi, Huoni, Shoukao, Xiongwang, Zaihuo, Beipan, Zhengdiao, Juanshu, Guishen, Yaonie, Bushu, Jizai, Yilun, Duiou, Yinglian, Dengmi, Zalu, Yutan, Ciqu, , Quanjie, Shihao, Caihua, Jiyi, Chanyue, Jianzheng, Jifeng, Mifeng, Jiamao, Chichai, Zhazhuan, Xiushi, Jiedong, Pinping, Lingru, Ganpao, Jinxu. Similar materials are attached under each topic. Mr. Zhang Hanrui's classification is quite careful, so there is no fault in finding a material that appears in two places. However, what we demand for perfection is the classification method. This is not a question of old or new, but a question of whether it is convenient for others to use this book. This classification method seems to be just the editor's subjective impression of understanding the content of the material, without an objective standard as a measure. Hard determination, the theme can not be limited by numbers; saying it is classification is actually equivalent to ignoring it. A material can be attached to more than one similar topic at the same time; many materials of the same thing, the same person, and the same play are scattered and cannot be concentrated together. Readers who treat this book as entertainment after tea and wine will certainly not pick on this phenomenon. I think the editor must not estimate the contribution of this book so humbly. However, if readers want to use the advantages of this book, they will first encounter a powerful man-made obstacle. This book has already been compiled and it is practically impossible to reorganize it. I am willing to put forward a small opinion, which represents the wishes of most readers. It is best if Mr. Zhang Hanrui can add a proper noun index and a cited book title index when this book is published, on the one hand, to fill the gaps, and most importantly, this extremely hard work must receive the good results of fulfilling its responsibilities.

(Evening of March 21, 1948.)

### Li Gou Did Not Like Mencius

— Qi Xia

Does this mean that Li Gou's attitude towards Mencius was very contradictory? I think this is not entirely true. We should seek an answer from the process of Li's ideological development.

In Li Gou's youth and middle age, although he was somewhat dissatisfied with Mencius, he still recognized the position he had already gained among the scholar-officials. Therefore, when he wrote a letter to Sun Sicheng at the age of twenty-three, he still listed Mencius as one of the saints, and when he wrote "Li Lun" at the age of twenty-four, he raised objections to Mencius's theory of the goodness of human nature. In "Pingtu Shu", which he wrote at the age of twenty-eight, he was quite displeased with Mencius's saying that "the Zhou people taxed with one-tenth on a hundred mu", but in "Zhou Li Zhi Taiping Lun", which he wrote at the age of thirty-five, he quoted many of Mencius's words as the basis for his argument. It can be seen that at these times, although Li Gou criticized Mencius, he also absorbed Mencius, and would not adopt a completely opposed attitude towards Mencius, and naturally he was not yet known to the world for opposing Mencius. Therefore, when Zu Wuzhe wrote a preface to Li Gou's collection of essays in the winter of the third year of Qingli (Li was thirty-five), he compared Li Gou to Mencius, saying "Li Taibo of Xujiang has the deep heart of Mencius and the six gentlemen." And in the first year of Huangyou (Li was forty-one), when Fan Zhongyan recommended Li Gou to the court, he also said in his memorial that "Li Gou's writing books and establishing words have the style and meaning of Mencius and Yang Xiong." If Li Gou had already completely denied Mencius at this time, and the society had already known that Li Gou was the most forceful person against Mencius, wouldn't Zu Wuzhe and Fan Zhongyan's words all become a kind of satire to Li Gou?

The most severe words of Li Gou's opposition to Mencius are all in his "Chang Yu", and "Chang Yu" was written in the year when he was forty-five years old. It was probably after he was forty years old that his tendency to oppose Mencius became more and more intense, and he tried his best to vent it in the book "Chang Yu". During this period, when Li Gou talked to people on a daily basis, he inevitably vilified Mencius to his heart's content, so it was passed on from person to person, and Li Gou became famous in the world as a "Mencius expert".

### Respectfully Request Rationing of Water and Electricity

— Pingzhai

A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that the Social Affairs Bureau had a plan to increase the types of rations, and also established a Research Association on the Compilation of Living Index. As the name suggests, it shows that the compilation of the living index has become quite a "problem". The association has been "researching" for the past few days. I don't know what results have been "researched" out yet, but it seems that we will have to wait until the end of the month to publish the index before we can fully appreciate the weight of the "research" of these gentlemen. But one thing seems to be beyond doubt: the Social Affairs Bureau believes that if it can ration eight kinds of rations, including cloth (including plain cloth and colored cloth), table salt, soy sauce, firewood, matches, socks, cigarettes, and soap, it can "stabilize" the living index.

Originally, in the late spring of April, the wind is warm and the sun is shining. It would be inappropriate to say "freeze" again. The word "stabilize" is seen to be appropriate and beautiful, suitable for all seasons. It should be taken out and praised. I will not mention it here.

However, in the newspaper the next day, I saw the news that the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions did not recognize the "Research Association on the Compilation of Living Index". According to the spokesperson of the Federation of Trade Unions: the Federation of Trade Unions was not invited to attend the research association, and said, "If the results produced by the activities of the association have any impact on the living index, the workers have no obligation to accept it. If the necessities of life are rationed, the Federation of Trade Unions welcomes it very much." (April 14 this newspaper)

Of course, the most directly affected by any new decisions on the living index are the workers throughout Shanghai. It is indeed no wonder that the Federation of Trade Unions has a sense of vigilance for "researching" such a "problem" without inviting members of the Federation of Trade Unions to attend.

However, rationing the necessities of life is indeed a very good thing, and if the living index can be stabilized by the stability of prices, it is of course what all our citizens sincerely desire. The question is, can prices be stabilized after rationing these cloth, salt, oil, firewood, matches, socks, cigarettes, and soap?

This is an important question. If what we are seeking is real stability, then we should "research" this question with our conscience.

Since we want to "research" how to stabilize prices, why not first look at how prices have risen? Let's look at the newspapers three days before the establishment of the "Research Association on the Compilation of Living Index", and we don't need to quote the numbers in detail, so as to avoid the criticism of filling the number of words to cheat the manuscript fee. We only look at the headline of the Shanghai edition of this newspaper that day (April 10):

New Prices for Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone

Consultations and Approval Implemented Yesterday

Telephone Increased by More Than One Fold to 65 to 70

Strong Reaction Prices Rose in the Afternoon

What a "strong reaction, prices rose in the afternoon", it is really "the magic is tested on the spot"! Have we ever seen news in the newspaper that day saying "Food and Matches Prices Rose, Strong Reaction, Prices Rose in the Afternoon"?

Stabilizing prices is good; stabilizing the living index is also good. We have repeatedly respectfully read the policy reports of the two directors of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau at the Municipal Council and their replies to the inquiries of the councilors. We deeply believe that these two are good officials and honest officials who are concerned about the suffering of the people. We citizens now only want to ask the upright old masters to show mercy and see if we can ration water and electricity at a flat price, just like the rationing of rice!

Otherwise, when presenting the banner of ten thousand people, we have to add a small parenthesis under the four golden characters of "Vanguard for the People", and inside the parenthesis are the two words "Price Increase" written in the blood and sweat of all the people of Shanghai.

### Double-Headed Monstrosity

— Mao Yi

Last year, a double-headed monstrosity appeared in Shanghai, exploiting its physical deformity to earn a sum of money. Sadly, this little life soon withered, and it never enjoyed anything beyond being a "spectacle." Similar double-headed monstrosities are not entirely unprecedented, but it is truly rare for them to grow into adulthood. Among these rare cases, the American double-headed woman Millie-Christine is a remarkable example.

Millie-Christine was born in Columbus County, North Carolina, in 1851. Her parents were a pair of black slaves. From the moment of her birth, she was taken from the black people's hut to the mansion of her parents' master, Joseph Smith. Smith, as if he had obtained a treasure, took great care of her. When she grew to fifteen months old, Smith took her on a tour of the entire United States.

Doctors and scientists examined Millie-Christine, and they all called her a contemporary monster. She had two heads, two shoulders, four arms, four legs, two lungs, and two hearts, but only one body.

Because she was almost like two people glued together, her master gave each body a separate name: one was called Millie, and the other was called Christine. Millie and Christine's main hobbies and habits were the same. "They" both loved music, dancing, and other entertainment. However, their opinions were not entirely consistent, and the two heads often engaged in heated debates over certain matters.

On the other hand, Millie and Christine were never lonely or isolated. Their arguments or differences of opinion never became severe enough to disrupt their pleasant and comfortable shared life.

Millie's voice was mezzo-soprano, while Christine sang soprano. According to music critics at the time, their joint singing was exceptionally sweet and moving. Wherever they performed, residents of nearby towns emptied their streets to attend, demonstrating the widespread sensation they caused.

The "Cincinnati Enquirer" at the time humorously said of Millie-Christine: "She could be an excellent juror because she can see both sides at the same time."

### Anecdotes of Chen Shi Yi

— Qian Dacheng

Lord Chen Shiyi (Yan), of Houguan, was renowned throughout the world for his poetry. In the late Qing Dynasty, he was the first to advocate emulating Song poetry, and he was the leader of the "Tongguang School." During the Guangxu era, he joined the staff of Zhang Zhidong. At that time, Zhidong was the governor-general of Huguang, and he was handling new policies. Expenses were enormous, and the public treasury was depleted. Lord Chen suggested minting copper coins to enrich the national treasury. Zhidong followed his advice, and prices rose as a result. Today, people only know that Zhidong created copper coins, but they do not know that the proposal actually originated from Lord Chen.

Lord Chen was deeply versed in classics and history, and he was particularly good at discussing poetry. He wrote "Shi Yi Shi Shi Hua" (Stone Remains Studio Poetry Talks), which was published by the Commercial Press. It was vast and profound, unprecedented. Poets of the time could become famous with just one word of praise from him. The sheer size of the work was also unprecedented in the history of poetry talks. Later, he completed a sequel, but the selection of material was somewhat indiscriminate, not as careful as the main volume. Critics often compared it to "Sui Yuan Shi Hua" (Sui Garden Poetry Talks), which is also a factual record.

Lord Chen looked like an old dragon in an autumn pool. He was old but still robust, walking as if flying, leaving young people far behind. After the age of eighty, he still took a plane to Sichuan to visit Mount Emei. Furthermore, he kept two young concubines, which was also a rare blessing from heaven.

In his later years, Lord Chen lived as a recluse in Suzhou, spending every day indulging in literary gatherings with people like Zhang Taiyan and Jin Songcen. Every week, he also went to Wuxi National Studies College to lecture for a day. When he arrived, he would drink and make merry with Tang Weizhi day and night, and he was never seen drunk.

Lord Chen was as famous as Chen Sanli and Zheng Xiaoxu. He compared Sanli to Huang Shangu, Xiaoxu to Chen Jianqi, and himself to Dongpo. Lord Chen even wrote a preface for Xiaoxu's "Hai Cang Lou Shi" (Sea Storage Building Poetry), which shows how deep their friendship was. After Xiaoxu joined the puppet state of Manchukuo, the Commercial Press reprinted "Shi Yi Shi Shi Hua," deleting references to Xiaoxu. Xiaoxu was greatly resentful. When Lord Chen died, he wrote an elegiac poem, saying, "What did Shiyi leave behind when he died?" The poem was filled with invective, revealing Xiaoxu's narrow-mindedness. This is why he was unable to judge his own conduct and lost the reputation he had earned in his early years. But Lord Chen never uttered a word criticizing Xiaoxu.

### About American Women

— Shuo Fu

According to an article published by American writer Maxine Churchill in "The American Magazine," if an American woman's name is Mary, she is five feet five inches tall, weighs one hundred and twenty-three pounds, and has completed eight and a half years of schooling, then she is a typical American woman.

According to other statistics about American women, they live longer than men, but their marriage rate is lower than men's. Even before the war, on average, one in seven young women was "left on the shelf."

Currently, the number of women going to university is constantly increasing, and their chances of getting married are decreasing, because only one-third of female college graduates get married. However, their academic performance is no worse than that of their male classmates.

In general, assuming that a typical American woman can be found, she has the advantages of being healthy, wealthy, and intelligent.

### Ramblings on Funeral Couplets

— Banmeng Laoren

Ling Qihan of Hange Pavilion said that antithetical literature is a national treasure unique to Chinese writing, unmatched by any other country in the world, which is certainly a true statement. Antithetical writing is unique to China, and among antithetical writings, the funeral couplet is especially distinctive. It not only expresses grief for the deceased but also encapsulates the deceased's life and career, expressing it in just a few words. No other country has this kind of literature.

The simplest and most forceful funeral couplets have only fourteen characters, such as the funeral couplet written by Ling Xiaohan of Hange Pavilion for Zeng Wenzheng: "His life was marked by friendship and mentorship; his spirit soared into the heavens like a feather." This is an example of fourteen characters. Most of these funeral couplets are collections of existing phrases from ancient texts. I once saw a friend who was addicted to Go write a funeral couplet for a friend who often played against him: "The scenery of Jiangnan is truly beautiful; I hear that Chang'an is like a Go board." My friend happened to have died after traveling from Suzhou to Beiping, which was also quite fitting. I wrote a funeral couplet for Xu Shuzheng: "His reputation shone brightly but he was ultimately resented; his writings are hidden in the mountains and will surely not be erased." Although I followed this example, I was unable to collect existing phrases.

The words in a funeral couplet do not need to be too many, nor do they need to be beautifully written. What matters is that they are lively and vivid, capable of capturing a meaning beyond the surface. Fan Kentang wrote a funeral couplet for Taoist Pan: "He once traveled with me, a solitary crane and a lonely boat, a thousand layers of sorrow on the river; now this person is gone, a single chicken and a jug of wine, a few lines of clear tears in Licheng South." Taoist Pan was a disciple of Fan, and this couplet is extremely natural and vivid.

Even when political views differ, suspicion disappears after death. Yang Xizi wrote a funeral couplet for Huang Keqiang: "Public duty did not forget private friendship; throughout life, political views diverged, but the liver and gall still pushed at friendship. One man could defeat ten thousand; alas, heroic talent was without destiny; life and death have always trapped heroes." Yang Xizi was a leading figure in the Hongxian Chounan Association, strongly opposed to the republic, which is not commendable, but this couplet is indeed extraordinary.

Funeral couplets for actors often contain many emotions, such as the one written by Wang Zeshan for Cheng Changgeng: "A farmer, how could I be wrong? The music back then, I will never forget Cui Jiu's hall, in the residence of Prince Qi. Guangling is dispersed and gone forever, where are the old travels? Let's not talk about the Zhenyuan courtiers, the Tianbao palace people." It is not only well-crafted and naturally matched, but also evokes infinite emotions. Another person wrote a funeral couplet for Tan Xiaotian: "What time is this? How can there be peaceful elegance? You have returned, it is good, you should be an enshrined immortal." At that time, Tan was called the old enshrined, and the last sentence perfectly fits Tan's status. When Yi Zhi died in the early spring of that year, someone also said: "His voice and appearance were extremely rare in the world, now there is no one in the South Palace, and it is also a time of desolation; the tears of the Canghai fall, Guangling is forever gone, let's not mention the Tianbin of that year." It is also a fitting tribute.

Pan Yu Shen Taimou was proficient in all kinds of learning. He wrote "Nanya Yitang Ye Shu," and was a strong member of the Southern Society. He and I and Ling Xiaohan corresponded frequently, and the letters piled up to inches thick. Later, when Shen returned to the mountains, Ling Xiao, who was good at writing couplets, did not write one, so I reluctantly wrote a couplet for him: "In old age, I carelessly filled out lyrics, weaving white hair and clear sorrow, a volume of heavy frost sadly dotted my temples; waking up, it's all a dream, washing away my green shirt and weeping tears, ten years of old rain made me swallow my voice." Since wreaths became popular, funeral couplets are not commonly used, and writers have gradually decreased. In the future, this tune may end up becoming Guangling San.

### "A Meager Gift"

— Li Li

At the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, after Shi Kefa was martyred, the Qing army advanced directly to Nanjing. Civil and military officials such as Wang Duo and Qian Qianyi came out of the city and knelt to welcome them, each offering heavy gifts to seek surrender.

It is said that Qian Qianyi's gift was the most "meager." The gift list was as follows: "A set of gold and silver utensils with flowing gold, and a set of cloisonné silver; a coiled dragon jade cup, a Song-made jade cup, a Tianlu rhinoceros cup, a sunflower rhinoceros cup, a hibiscus rhinoceros cup, and a cloisonné tripod cup; a pair of cloisonné crane cups and silver-inlaid crane cups; Xuan De palace fans, thirty pure gold fans, Yiyang gold fans, Geqi gold fans, a hundred sons palace fans, and ten pure gold Hangzhou fans; ten pure gold Suzhou fans, and ten pairs of silver-inlaid ivory chopsticks."

### Wandering Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14 Wandering at Sea

Xiao Bai said: "That's right, it's a pity I didn't bring it. I can tell you the general idea of ​​the letter. She said that she has been very popular in all aspects since she arrived in Shanghai. Now, there are some people who want to choose a Peking Opera queen. It's likely that she has a good chance to win the Queen's throne. This is a glory for her. Secondly, Dr. Mei has accepted her as a disciple, personally teaching her the plays and vigorously promoting her. She feels that the future is very promising, which is most comforting to her. There is also one of the most peculiar things. Recently, a certain top figure wants to meet her and talk about art and life. She pays close attention to this point and considers it a rare opportunity to boast to her peers in the future. The three things, in the lines of the letter, are all very excited and proud. What she is feeling distressed about now is that many wealthy bosses are pestering her, and there are many people she doesn't want to get close to, but for the sake of the scene, she has to. According to her letter, from the time she gets up to the time she goes to the theater, there are always guests coming to find her. Every day, she wants to eat a quiet meal at home, but she doesn't have the time. She is always invited out for tea dances or evening parties. These occasions are all important and cannot be offended, so she is mentally exhausted every day. In addition, the Shanghai theaters require almost all the big stars to perform double bills, making her dizzy all day long, unaware of the world. She also said in her letter that if she sees you, she will advise you to work hard for your future. She is doing well in Shanghai and intends to have fun for a while before deciding what to do. Look at how a girl can pick herself up and let things go. She has recovered after suffering such a serious blow, and she has re-established her career in Shanghai. You are still depressed and can't see through everything, which is not as good as her. From now on, you have to put everything aside, cheer up, and strive forward. Don't worry about a girlfriend anymore." Zhu Zhai said: "I think the letter she wrote to my father was also very depressed and not optimistic." Xiao Bai said: "You silly boy, she wrote to your father and me. If she told your father the truth, what value would this person have in your father's eyes? She was able to create her current status. Wasn't it your father who successfully stimulated her? If she told your father how proud she was to go to Shanghai, in your father's eyes, this kind of flighty woman was fortunate to have been sent away first, otherwise this kind of person would come to the house and become a disaster. She complains about her depression and suffering, which is precisely her cleverness. Don't be deceived by her. She is making a name for herself in Shanghai, enjoying herself, but you are frowning all day, thinking about her, which is too foolish and silly. Young people are all emotional and easily go astray. In the future, no matter what you do, you must judge it rationally, so that you will not suffer yourself." 18

### Painting Inscriptions from the Sword Studio

— Chen Zhongtao

Inscription on a Painting of Listening to Rain by a Banana Window

Raindrops fall high and low like ten thousand crossbows,
The banana trees interpret it as a fluttering dance;
Sparse lattice lets the wind enter, a lamp flickers,
Dreaming of hearing reeds and spring geese in the lake;
Wine is cold, fragrance is gone, the dream returns to wakefulness,
The shadows of the lake and river are too fragmented;
Unable to sleep, I love counting the night watch,
Tomorrow, apricot blossoms will surely fill the lane.

Inscription on a Painting of Talking Poetry in a River Pavilion

This path is difficult to grasp, there is no second door,
What can be said is only stepping over the fence.
Sometimes one forgets words when content,
But listens to the river's sound, freely clamoring.

### Lei Hui

In the late Qing Dynasty, Shanghai produced several "biographical" novels: "Officialdom Unmasked," "The Travels of Lao Can," and "Flower in a Sinful Sea." Each realistically depicted aspects of politics and society, so they can be considered "biographical works." Qing Dynasty novels were numerous but of varying quality. Those of the highest quality could represent the literature of an era. "Dream of the Red Chamber" was profound, magnificent, and unparalleled. "The Scholars," "Gallant Maid and Knight," "Outlaws of the Marsh," and various chivalrous detective stories were also worth reading. The aforementioned works of the late Qing Dynasty served as the rearguard, adding glory to the genre.

A so-called "biographical work" should not only be interesting to read at the time but also have lasting value for repeated reading and contemplation. After publication, it should not rely on promotion but be considered worth reading at any time and kept on the desk. This is a successful work. During the Qing Dynasty, all industries were in decline, society was fixed, and politics and people's lives, the gains and losses of the times, were "controlled by the hands of officials." Officials who rose through the imperial examination system were considered the orthodox path, and the public admired only becoming an official and passing the imperial examinations. Thus, "Flower in a Sinful Sea," which depicted the affairs of officials in the capital and members of the Hanlin Academy, was a notable work. (The author of "Flower in a Sinful Sea," Zeng Jun, was the son-in-law of Wang Liu Men. Wang was a Hanlin scholar in the Yichou year, repeatedly in charge of literary exams, and a veteran of the literary world, so his son-in-law was also able to speak and write well. The book still has errors and amateurish language, which a certain magazine published in Shanghai four years ago listed. However, such minor flaws cannot obscure its overall value because few novels depict the scenery of the capital's officialdom.)

In the era of the imperial examination, a scholar's life was centered on exams, progressing from a child student to a student, from a student to a Jiasheng, a licentiate, and from a licentiate to a metropolitan graduate, without missing any level. Even after becoming a metropolitan graduate and entering the Hanlin Academy, known as the pure and noble class, one would be sent out as the chief examiner of a provincial or educational exam to examine others. However, before going on such assignments, one had to pass the "exam for assignments." Furthermore, the Hanlin Academy had a grand exam, in which the best were promoted and the worst were demoted and punished. Thus, there is a poem: "Golden-topped hat, court beads, purple sable coat, immortals rejoice together on a sunny day; upon hearing of the grand exam, their souls all fall, even retiring immortals are not spared." The feeling of "Hanlin scholars fearing the grand exam" is the same as that of "scholars fearing the annual exam." The exams depicted in "Flower in a Sinful Sea" are a class of exams that transcend the imperial examination.

Among the imperial examinations, the provincial and metropolitan exams were the most important. "Gallant Maid and Knight" is considered the best at depicting them in detail. Its depiction of An Gongzi's provincial exam, from entering the exam compound to the posting of the results and the announcement of the congratulations, everything is described in detail, vividly depicting the mood of the examiners and the candidates. This scene of the main examination hall, which occupied more than a thousand years of old cultural history, will truly remain in people's minds, and its historical value is unmatched by anything else. (If "Flower in a Sinful Sea" had such detail, then its description of the various exams of the Hanlin Academy would be even more remarkable.) This kind of realistic value far exceeds that of party-related notes because notes can only record events, not convey spirit and depict scenes, so that readers feel as if they are there. The author, Wen Kang, was a licentiate, so his writing is most accurate when describing the licentiate's examination. Because he was not a metropolitan graduate and did not preside over literary examinations, the sequence of the palace examination and the triennial examination, and the distinction between seat numbers and roll numbers, were all pointed out as mistaken by Xun. Dong Lao asked to comment on this book, "the owner of my studio." He was from Yangzhou, a metropolitan graduate in the Gengzi year of Daoguang, and rose to the position of Minister of Revenue. He was the chief examiner of the provincial examinations in the Wuchen year of Tongzhi and the Bingzi year of Guangxu, and various literary assignments, so he was familiar with everything.) However, even these few sections on the provincial exam are an unparalleled success, which cannot be written by other books or others. The scene in the metropolitan examination hall is roughly the same as that in the provincial exam, so the meetings of An Laoye and An Gongzi in the exam compound are briefly described. The "old scholar" is called "small exam," which is the first step to fame for scholars, and the academy presides over it. "The Scholars" and "A Marriage to Awaken the World; or, A Story to Make Men Wise" and "Marvelous Views of Times Past and Present" all have depictions of it that can be used as a model.
