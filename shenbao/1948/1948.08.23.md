### Presidential Encouragement to the Nation: Stabilize the Economy and Government through Agreement, Uphold Laws and Complete the Great Undertaking of Reconstruction

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] The President, determined to earnestly implement the emergency measures for financial and economic management and to thoroughly eliminate lurking spies and bandits, issued a statement on the current situation and major government measures. The Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, Dong Xian Guang, held a press conference at 5 p.m. on the 22nd, immediately announcing the statement and expressing the hope that the national press would assist in disseminating it to accomplish this task. Director Dong also stated at the conference that the President had originally intended to meet with reporters personally to discuss the matter, but was unable to do so due to other affairs, which demonstrates the President's emphasis on the matter. The conference proceeded swiftly, with Director Dong adjourning the meeting immediately after announcing the President's statement.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] President Chiang recently issued a statement on the current situation and major government measures. The full text is as follows:

At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, all of our compatriots throughout the country had fervent hopes for the post-war economic recovery and improvement of living standards. Zhong Zheng especially focused on establishing a foundation for national construction and cultivating talent for construction, hoping to work together with all compatriots throughout the country to realize our Three Principles of the People, the ideal of national construction. It has been three years since the end of the War of Resistance. If there had been no rebellion by the treacherous bandits and communists, the economic lives of our people and the national construction endeavors would have already achieved unprecedented progress in a stable environment, advancing together with democratic countries towards recovery and prosperity. However, the communist bandits have been deliberately plotting to endanger the integrity of our territorial sovereignty, undermine the foundation of our national unity and independence, destroy the glorious history of our nation's victory, and our position of freedom and equality. They are acting perversely, insisting on their bandit path of armed rebellion, cruel slaughter, and massacre, causing the current situation of national devastation and the people's suffering.

Now that the communist bandits have taken advantage of the weakness of our post-war economic devastation and the exhaustion of the military and civilians to launch a full-scale rebellion for three years, their violence, after this long-term rebellion, has still failed to subvert our national foundation and destroy our people's lives. Therefore, they will be even less able to achieve their goal of selling out the country and enslaving the nation in the future. Especially in the past year, they have used land reform as a deceptive slogan and liquidation as a means of coercion, engaging in exhaustive exploitation of manpower and resources in the bandit areas, attempting a final desperate gamble against the government. However, the facts have proven that the communist bandits' so-called "one-year plan" has failed. Their military adventures have not achieved their expected goals, and their brutal struggles have backfired. Famine has been created in the bandit areas, and the people in the bandit areas have also awakened and begun to resist the treacherous bandits. Therefore, the treacherous bandits have had to use political offensives to conceal their fundamental failure, inciting young students in our rear areas, opening up their so-called "second front," and instigating peripheral elements to launch their so-called "anti-war and peace-seeking" movement in order to disrupt our social order and obstruct our mobilization for suppressing the rebellion. Among them, a small number of people who are not clearly aware, incited by the bandits, and echoing their sentiments, are transferring the responsibility for all the tragic situations caused by the treacherous bandits' use of cruel massacres and terror control to the government, even blaming the government for creating a civil war. They are unaware that today's government's military operations to suppress the bandits are for defending the integrity of territorial sovereignty and for maintaining the position of independence and freedom. In essence, it is a continuation of the national war of the eight-year War of Resistance. If the country's unification and independence are not achieved for a single day, and the suffering and poisoning of our compatriots in the bandit areas are not alleviated for a single day, then the duty of our patriotic military and civilians to suppress bandits and quell the rebellion cannot be abandoned for a single day. Otherwise, the victorious fruits gained by all compatriots throughout the country through bloodshed and sacrifice during the eight-year War of Resistance will not only be impossible to preserve, but the entire nation and people will be enslaved and will never have a chance to rise again.

### Harming the Credit of the New Currency is to be an Enemy of the Entire People - The People Should Rise Up to Correct and Report

However, the government does not abandon its work of national construction because of the ongoing military operations to suppress bandits. At this time, after a long period of war, when the treacherous bandits are in full-scale rebellion, the legal currency is gradually entering a stage of malignant inflation, and the national economy and the people's livelihood are all severely threatened. The government has had to resolutely reform the currency system. The issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificates this time has undergone careful deliberation, sufficient preparations have been made, a sound system has been established, and finances have been reorganized and the economy managed to ensure the successful implementation of the currency reform. Zhong Zheng also holds firm beliefs and determination to implement the four measures promulgated in the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Disposal. In the future, the progress of national construction and the stability of the people's lives will depend on stable currency values and prices. All patriotic compatriots will surely unanimously support this new currency policy, and should especially thoroughly recognize that this currency reform is not only the foundation for the reorganization of national finances, but also the prerequisite for the stability of the people's livelihood. It must be known that the government is the government of all the people of the country, and the country is also the country of all the people of the country. As the ancients said, "If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?" At a time when the treacherous bandits are rampant and the national situation is severe, the people, the country, and the government are closely related in terms of fortune, misfortune, honor, and disgrace, and there is absolutely no difference in terms of survival and demise. The people's support for the country's new currency is the way to stabilize their own livelihoods. The people's obedience to the government's laws and decrees is also the way to protect their own rights. It is hoped that all compatriots throughout the country will understand that they have become an inseparable part of the country and the government. Therefore, the people and the government should not only trust and help each other and cooperate seamlessly, but also the people should persuade each other and encourage each other to fully support the policy of reforming the currency system and thoroughly implement the laws and decrees for controlling the economy. If a small number of people disregard the overall situation and only seek private gain, continuing the practices of the period when the legal currency depreciated, manipulating the new currency as a tool for speculation and monopoly to harm its credit, that is to destroy the livelihoods of all the people of the country, and they are the public enemies of all the people of the country. The government will naturally, in accordance with the National General Mobilization Law and criminal regulations, treat them as treacherous bandits who sell out the country and impose severe sanctions on them. The people should also rise up to correct and report them, assist the government, and complete this policy for the sake of the country and the people, stabilizing the economy, and guaranteeing the people's livelihood. In the past ten years, the legal currency system has completed its mission of supporting the War of Resistance and national construction. It is firmly believed that from today onwards, the gold currency system will also be able to contribute to the ultimate success of the great cause of national construction.

### Plots to Incite Youth - Decisively Will Not Sit Idly By and Watch it Spread

Encourage the Restoration of a Spirit of Integrity and Awareness of Shame

National construction must have its material conditions, but it must also have its spiritual driving force. Universities are the gardens for cultivating construction talent, and even more so, the source of the spirit of national construction. However, today, the communist bandits are burying spies within universities in various places, inciting and organizing students, sacrificing their studies, destroying their rationality for suppressing rebellion and building the country, and making them take on the urban work and internal lines of the bandit army. They are also daring to spread poison in the minds of young university students, in order to destroy our national history and culture, and to undermine the national consciousness and scientific cultivation that are essential for construction talent. The government will never sit idly by and watch this crime of undermining the new life of our nation spread. Even in the midst of the country's financial difficulties, it is still doing its utmost to maintain the public expenses of university students and provide relief to students who have fled from the bandit areas, showing utmost care for young people. However, it will no longer condone actions that harm the country and society under the direction of the treacherous bandits. Therefore, it has issued orders to investigate communist spies, paying particular attention to eliminating conspiratorial elements among young university students, in order to protect the safety of schools and the studies of young people.

At this time of national survival and honor, it is hoped that all compatriots throughout the country will trust the government, abide by laws and decrees, establish a sound and healthy currency system, abandon speculative and monopolistic behavior, refrain from waste, advocate thrift and economy, maintain the traditional virtues of diligence and frugality of our Chinese people, restore the inherent spirit of integrity and awareness of shame of our nation, report treacherous bandits and spies, maintain social order, protect the safety of schools, and cherish the studies of young people. In this way, suppressing rebellion and building the country will advance simultaneously, and the entire country will work together with one heart to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete the National Revolution, so as to bring comfort to the spirits in heaven of the soldiers and revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the War of Resistance and suppressing the bandits.

### Rumor Has it That a Large Team of American Flying Fortresses Will Be Transferred from Guam to Qingdao - Repair of Chengyang Airport to Be Used for Military Purposes

[Our Qingdao Bureau, 20th] Two squadrons of American Flying Fortresses will be transferred from Guam to Qingdao and will frequently visit Pingjin. This information was revealed by the American side, and it is understood that Major General Si Mai Shen, leader of the Air Force Group of the American Military Advisory Group, had previously come here from Pingjin for inspection, which is related to this matter. The Qingdao airport is currently undergoing major adjustments. The current Cangku Airport is 18 kilometers away from the urban area and is too small. It houses a large squadron of fighter planes from the US Marine Corps and some naval transport planes, as well as two squadrons of the Chinese Air Force, and also serves as a civil aviation airport, which is already very crowded. In the future, it will be used exclusively for civilian purposes (including the civil aviation brigade). The Chengyang Airport, which has been abandoned, is 31 kilometers away from the urban area and will be used exclusively for military purposes by China and the United States. The airport can accommodate more than 300 aircraft. Cangku Airport is close to the harbor and is often disturbed by fog, while Chengyang is not. During the war, the Japanese army specially designated it for military use. The repair work can be completed as early as two weeks later.

### Employees of State-Run Enterprises - Salaries According to New Regulations

The original order is as follows: It is stipulated in Article 21 of the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Disposal "Measures for Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Control" that the salaries of employees of state-run enterprises shall be converted into Gold Yuan Certificates in accordance with the provisions of Articles 18, 19, and 20, and the actual income per person, in addition to being able to add up to 30% more than the income of civil servants of the same level in accordance with the salary measures for employees of state-run enterprises, the portion exceeding this limit shall be cancelled uniformly. This measure shall be implemented from August 20 of this year. The salaries of all employees of state-run enterprises shall be strictly checked and handled in accordance with the provisions of this article from August of this year. It is not allowed to delay compliance on the pretext that there was previously a special approval for the opposition case, nor is it allowed to make any changes in any name. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued to be strictly followed and implemented, and the implementation situation shall be reported within days after the document arrives. In addition to separate orders, this order.

Dissatisfaction with the New Supervisor, Hao Yulin

[Our Beiping Bureau, 22nd] Employees of the Hebei Supervisory Envoy's Office suddenly submitted their resignations en masse and will publish an article entitled "Such a Supervisor" to explain the reasons. Workers who resigned claimed that the new supervisor, Hao Yulin, was elected from Tianjin, and the Tianjin Provisional Council had impeached Hao for abusing his power and selling the council's cars, and therefore they were unwilling to be his subordinates. Another worker claimed that when the new supervisor arrived, he immediately asked how many workers there were, how many cars there were, and how many houses there were, and they were unwilling to sit and wait to be laid off, so they resigned first.

### Appealing for Redress of Grievances - Former Consul in Songkhla, Siam - Qiu Shouyu Hosts Reporters

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] Qiu Shouyu, the former consul of our country's consulate general in Songkhla, Siam, hosted reporters in Beijing on the 22nd. In addition to reporting on the situation of overseas Chinese in southern Siam, he also appealed to the media to support his redress of the injustice of being framed and dismissed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a four-country punishment. Qiu is one of our country's few experts on Southeast Asian issues, proficient in Malay, and also knows Min and Cantonese dialects. He once served as a specialized member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has written many works. When he accompanied Special Envoy Li Di to comfort the Dutch East Indies two years ago, he made great contributions. Later, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a consulate general in Songkhla, southern Siam, he was appointed as consul and went to open the consulate with Consul General Yan Wanli, assisting in everything and gaining the support and faith of the local overseas Chinese. Qiu is a scholar by nature and is upright, which led to resentment from others. Three months ago, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a letter falsely using the name of the Songkhla Overseas Chinese Group, imitating Qiu's handwriting. There were many criticisms of Consul General Yan, and it recommended that Qiu be appointed as Consul General. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was deceived and suspected that it was Qiu's doing, and immediately ordered Qiu to return to China. After Qiu returned to China, he learned the truth and strongly denied the injustice, emphasizing that even if he was foolish, he would not write a letter himself to recommend himself. How could he be subject to such a decisive punishment because of a baseless letter? He requested that the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs thoroughly investigate the matter. However, after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the Criminal Division of the Internal Affairs Police Headquarters to identify the handwriting, it also recognized that it was written by Qiu. Qiu believes that he was convicted of "unfounded charges" and that his reputation and career have both been damaged. He has decided to apply to the higher authorities and, if necessary, plans to appeal to the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate the whole matter. Qiu said at the end that he will write "Impressions of Traveling in Siam" to report on the hardships of overseas Chinese.

### Sino-American Jointly Establish Implementation Agencies to Utilize US Aid Cotton - Petroleum Procurement is Under Negotiation

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] The US Aid Utilization Committee and the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration are scheduled to hold their third joint meeting on the afternoon of the 25th. Regarding Lai Bohan's proposal to utilize US aid cotton, China and the United States will establish an implementation agency to jointly handle the matter. China and the United States have reached an agreement on discussions in Shanghai in the near future, and a decision will be made at the meeting on the 25th. In addition, how to calculate the US aid account after our country's currency system reform may also be discussed on the 25th. At that time, Steelman will also report on his trip back to the United States. Lai Bohan is scheduled to return to Beijing from Qingdao on the 24th to attend.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] Several batches of food and cotton from US aid materials have been transported to China one after another, but petroleum has not been purchased and transported due to the impact of Section 202 of the US Public Law (793). The article stipulates that "US aid funds shall not be used for bulk purchases of materials outside the United States when the price exceeds the price of purchases within the United States." The petroleum in US aid materials needs to be purchased outside the borders of the United States and is subject to the restrictions of the above article, so the US Economic Cooperation Administration has not issued the disbursement order and the authorization to purchase, making it impossible to purchase. China is currently discussing a solution to this problem with the US, hoping to obtain results within two weeks. After this problem is resolved, the petroleum in US aid materials can be purchased and shipped to China.

### Implementing the Self-Help Program

Currency Reform is a Concrete Manifestation

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] Regarding the implementation of US aid in conjunction with the implementation of the self-help program and the specific implementation methods, we originally planned to provide the US with reference materials before the end of August. Recently, due to the implementation of currency reform by our government, the ministries and commissions have not been able to submit the implementation of the self-help program and implementation methods to the US Aid Committee due to the implementation of the new economic measures. Therefore, the time for us to submit this information to the US may be slightly extended, but the latest date for submitting this information will be the beginning of September. The Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Disposal promulgated by our President this time, the implementation of currency reform, reorganization of finances, and strengthening of economic control are concrete manifestations of the implementation of the self-help program.

### MacArthur Feted Zhang Qun Yesterday - The President's Letter to MacArthur Has Been Delivered

[Another Dispatch] The Japanese press attaches great importance to the visit of former Premier Zhang Qun to Japan.

Editorial

### Looking at Shanghai's Prices Today – After Reading President Chiang's Speech –

Following the government's promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy on the 19th of this month, all silver and money exchanges and various trading markets nationwide were closed for two days. Yesterday was also a regular Sunday holiday, and they will reopen today with the start of the issuance of the new currency, the Gold Yuan note. Although the legal tender can be used concurrently with the Gold Yuan note until November 20th, all prices from today onward will be marked in Gold Yuan notes, and whether they can be fully converted from the prices before the 19th into Gold Yuan notes will be a major key to the success or failure of this currency reform. President Chiang, therefore, delivered an important speech yesterday in the capital, hoping on the one hand that the people of the country and the government would trust and cooperate with each other, and that people would advise each other to help the government implement the laws and complete this important task of currency reform; on the other hand, he warned the people of the country that if there were still speculative manipulations and disturbances in the financial sector, they would be severely sanctioned in accordance with the General Mobilization Law and criminal regulations. The people of the country were deeply moved upon hearing these words. Whether the general prices in the Shanghai market today can be fully converted from the prices before the 19th into Gold Yuan notes without any fluctuations can be considered a touchstone for whether the citizens of Shanghai are determined to support the national policy.

The central government has always regarded Shanghai as the economic hub of the country. The rise and fall of Shanghai's prices are enough to influence prices throughout the country; therefore, the government's currency reform this time also pays special attention to whether Shanghai's prices will fluctuate. President Chiang has repeatedly stated that he hopes that the financial and industrial circles in Shanghai can lead and assist the government in completing the task. The earnest expectation makes the citizens of Shanghai even more aware of the importance of the responsibilities they bear. According to usual practice, Shanghai's prices will certainly not fluctuate today, causing the well-born new currency to suffer setbacks as soon as it is born, causing pain to those close to it and pleasing the enemy.

To be fair, the government has undertaken this currency reform with great determination. From any angle, it is worthy of the people's sincere support. Its importance is truly as President Chiang said: "This currency reform is truly related to the prosperity, decline, fortune, and misfortune of the entire nation and people." Taking a step back, even if one does not consider the interests of the country and only considers personal interests, one should still wholeheartedly assist the government in completing the currency reform. The reason is simple: First, before the death of the legal tender, it had indeed reached the beginning stage of malignant inflation. If the government did not have the determination to "cut off its arm to save the body" to reform, then not only would the rise in prices be endless, threatening the lives of the people, but also all industries and commerce would be plunged into a state of depletion and collapse due to the cyclical rise in prices, wages, and interest rates. After this reform, it will not only be conducive to the stability of finance, but also the lives of the people and all industries and commerce can be expected to be stable from now on. Second, because the issuance system of the legal tender was unsound, it had long lost the people's trust, causing the purchasing value of the legal tender for goods to be far below its actual value. Now that a new currency is being issued, not only is there ample reserve, but also a public issuance system is adopted, and the guaranteed reserve will also be received and kept in custody by the supervisory committee. It can be expected to restore the people's confidence in the new currency. Third, the fluctuating value of the legal tender in the past was a fatal blow to industry and commerce. Any production plan, any business plan, was impossible to talk about. Now that a new currency is issued and the value is stable, from now on it can promote production, prosper the market, and increase exports, so that our country's foreign trade and international balance of payments can also be expected to gradually become balanced.

The advantages and disadvantages of currency reform can be said to be known at a glance. Except for a few mad and selfish people in the country, no one does not support the new currency and hope for its success. However, in order to sincerely hope for success, we still have to frankly point out that there are two things that the government must make every effort to restrain: First, the government must respect the independence of the right of issuance, so that the issuance of the Central Bank's Gold Yuan notes is completely subject to the prior supervision of the supervisory committee, so that not a single Gold Yuan note is issued rashly without reserve. To do this, first ask the supervisory committee to check the total amount of legal tender and Northeast circulating coupons issued in the past, report it publicly, and absolutely stop the continued printing from now on. Then, the Gold Yuan notes used to redeem this old currency should be separated from the total amount and used for successive redemption, so as not to increase the total amount of currency in circulation due to the simultaneous use of the two. At the same time, without the signature of the person in charge of the supervisory committee, absolutely do not issue a single Gold Yuan note casually, in order to show great faith to the world. Second, the government must absolutely guarantee the property rights of good people who obey the laws, and strictly punish those who violate the law and seek personal gain without leniency. In the past, government laws and regulations were promulgated, but often went awry when implemented. Those who took the lead in abiding by them suffered. In the future, this must not be repeated. To be honest, there are always some people in society who take chances and profit from them. Now that they see the government reforming the currency system, stabilizing the economy, and stabilizing the people's livelihood, it is tantamount to announcing that their doomsday has arrived. They may not be dead yet, and they will take the opportunity to rise up, either making waves in the black market or raising prices in the market, attempting to defeat the emergency economic and financial measures implemented by the government. Even traitorous bandits and spies exist everywhere, or even harbor a schadenfreude mentality, fearing that the country's currency reform will succeed, and therefore do everything possible to instigate and disrupt the market for pleasure. Therefore, if we sincerely hope that the currency reform will succeed, then we must have the people and the government trust and cooperate with each other, challenge these scum, and finally overcome them.

In short, President Chiang has frankly stated that the government not only has the belief that the currency reform "will succeed," but also has great determination. As long as the government's executors work diligently and implement it effectively, as long as the people of the country can trust and cooperate with the government and work hard with one heart and one mind, then any difficult problems that will be faced in the future can be easily solved. However, everything must be carefully planned at the beginning. Looking at Shanghai's prices today, not only can we see the success or failure of the future of currency reform, but also whether the citizens of Shanghai have conscience and reason, whether they have the spirit of obeying and abiding by the law, and whether they have the ability to judge gains and losses, all can be seen.

### Naval Academy Freshmen Take Preliminary Examination, 480 Admitted, First Concentrated on Two Ships for Short-Term Training

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] According to the Naval Political Warfare Department: The recruitment examination for the 37th class of freshmen at the Naval Academy and the Mechanical School began in early July and has lasted for more than a month. A total of more than 6,000 people registered in nine examination districts across the country, breaking the record for the number of freshmen applicants in previous years. In order to maintain the excellent quality of the navy, the authorities have decided that the evaluation of the results should be fair and strict.

### Three-Nation Envoys Revisit the Kremlin, Negotiations Approaching Decision Stage, Four-Power Conference to Be Held in Paris If Agreement Reached on German Question

[Reported] London, 22nd. Paris broadcast: A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry stated on the evening of the 22nd that Stalin is likely to receive the envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France soon, possibly on the 23rd or the evening of the 22nd.

[Reported] London, 22nd Broadcast: It is widely believed that the next meeting between the envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will be held at the Kremlin on the afternoon of the 23rd. Most observers believe that this meeting will be the last, and whether an agreement can be reached on the negotiations for a Four-Power Conference must be decided at this meeting. Sources in Moscow believe that if the Soviet Union can express agreement on the principles of the negotiations, the Four-Power Conference can be convened quickly, probably in Paris.

[Reported] London, 22nd Broadcast from Moscow: US Ambassador Smith, British Special Envoy Roberts, and French Ambassador Chataigneau met at Smith's residence for one hour and forty-five minutes on the 22nd, the longest meeting to date. The three-nation envoys are currently awaiting news of a visit with Molotov, and they believe that Molotov may receive the three-nation envoys on Sunday (the 22nd).

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] According to sources close to the French Foreign Ministry today, the three-nation representatives stationed in Moscow will pay a visit to Stalin for the last round of preliminary talks between the three powers and the Soviet Union. It was also stated that the report received last night from French Ambassador Chataigneau is currently being studied by the Foreign Ministry. The talks in Moscow aim to reach agreement on the conditions for starting Four-Power negotiations on the German question. Therefore, the discussions only concern the Berlin situation caused by the Soviet blockade and the implementation of currency reform, and other issues such as reparations and the Ruhr are not involved. French officials finally firmly denied the rumors that the Western three powers have been slow to schedule the next meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov due to disagreements.

[United Press, Berlin, 22nd] The "National Daily," registered with the Soviet Union, reported from Moscow on the 22nd: "A unanimous solution has been reached in Moscow on the German question." The newspaper published the headline "Greater Berlin Currency Agreed Upon in Moscow" on its front page. The content did not mention the source of the news, but only stated, "It can be confirmed that the Western countries have recognized the East German currency as the sole currency system in Greater Berlin." The newspaper also stated that the three Western envoys will visit Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 22nd and further stated, "It is believed that this is the last meeting of the current stage of talks between the Western representatives and Soviet officials." The "National Daily" stated that the German debt and the control of the Ruhr area "were not studied in detail during the discussion, but were only slightly discussed as a basis for the upcoming Four-Foreign Ministers' Conference." It should be noted that these two issues were the two main problems that led to the breakdown of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference last December.

### Most of the Personnel of the US and French Military Governments Have Withdrawn from Berlin, Cold War Remains, Troops Still Stationed

[Central News Agency, Frankfurt, 21st, United Press] General Clay, Governor of the US Military Government, recently stated that after the breakdown of the four-power government in Berlin, most of the personnel of the US and French military governments have withdrawn from Berlin. However, because the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the Western countries remains, the Berlin garrison has not withdrawn. It is said that more than 75% of the personnel of the US Military Government have left Berlin, with only senior personnel and special advisors remaining. Many of the officers in the civil affairs agencies have been withdrawn to Nuremberg and Frankfurt, but the supervisors still remain in Berlin. It is said that in the past three weeks, about 3,000 French military government personnel and their families have withdrawn from Berlin.

### Border of the Three Occupation Zones of Berlin: British, American, and Soviet Military Police Confront Each Other

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st, United Press] The United Kingdom and the United States have strengthened their guard forces. On the Potsdammer Platz, there are currently 150 military police facing 165 Soviet military and police personnel, and the atmosphere is gradually becoming tense. A total of 4,000 German civilians flocked to the Potsdammer Platz to watch. 60 British military police blocked the Potsdam road junction, and 75 American military police, supported by jeep patrols, were deployed on Strassmann Street nearby. They used jeeps as a front line, and bayonets were fixed to their rifles.

[United Press, Berlin, 22nd] British and American military police patrols continued to be stationed in downtown Berlin on the 22nd, while the Potsdammer Platz, the center of riots, shootings, stabbings, and kidnappings for two days, turned quiet again. The newly established signposts, wooden fences, and power grids on the border of the interlocking occupation zones of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union made the division of the occupation zones clear at a glance. American Public Security Chief Eisenhower stated that the military police patrols will remain there day and night "to protect our part." Black market merchants came to the Potsdammer Platz again in the morning of the 22nd and returned to their original positions, but they were hesitant in their transactions and lacked large customers. It should be noted that there used to be 4,000 people gathered there, but now only 500 Germans are coming and going to watch. The American Public Security Team and the Military Discipline Section have not received any news about the eight German police officers who were kidnapped by the Soviet army in the previous two days.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 22nd] TASS released news this morning about the recent incident on the Potsdammer Platz in Berlin, stating that Soviet police were attacked by a group of thugs who had infiltrated the crowd. The agency was quite dissatisfied with the attitude of the British and American police, saying that the British and American police stood by and watched when the incident occurred and did not come forward to stop the rioters until the Soviet military police arrived and order was restored. TASS concluded that the riot was purely planned and that this plan can be explained by the fact that American and British photographers were already at the scene taking pictures when the incident occurred.

### East Zone Germans Request to Participate in West German Government

[Reported] London, 22nd Broadcast: According to German sources, Western administrative authorities are discussing with right-wing leaders from the Soviet zone the matter of non-Communist members in the Soviet zone participating in the planned West German government. According to unofficial reports, one of the leaders in the Soviet zone is the former chairman of the right-wing Christian Democratic Party in the Soviet zone. Whether former Soviet zone politicians will have voting rights in the West German government is still in question. However, Germans generally believe that regardless of the outcome of the Moscow Four-Power talks, Germans in the East zone should have the right to participate in the West German government.

### The Soviet Union Repeatedly Promotes the Supply of Food to Berlin

Only 20,000 Tons of Millet Delivered

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 21st] The Information Bureau of the Soviet Zone has repeatedly issued public announcements, emphasizing that the Soviet Union will supply a large amount of grain and fats to all Berlin residents. Currently, ten transport ships carrying wheat have arrived here, and 5 million tons of sweet potatoes from the Czech Republic and 3 million tons from Poland have arrived here, and another 4 million tons can be added before November. In addition, Poland will supply 500 tons of oil and fats for the manufacture of artificial butter, as well as 5,000 tons of meat. Before December 31, the Soviet Zone will import 50,000 tons of fresh and canned fish. Although the Soviet authorities and various news agencies and newspapers have repeatedly emphasized the above-mentioned propaganda, only 20,000 tons of millet have actually arrived here so far.

### "Pan-European Parliament" Movement, Preparatory Committee to Convene in Brussels in November, France Invites UK, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg to Send Representatives

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] A five-nation preparatory committee may hold a meeting in Brussels in November, at which time the first step towards creating a United States of Europe may be taken. In accordance with diplomatic convention, the French government has invited the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to send parliamentary delegations to attend the meeting. If the four countries accept the invitation to attend, they will plan how to convene a pan-European conference. Although the nature of the Pan-European Parliament is only advisory, the dream of European unity from Charlemagne the Great to Churchill can be centered around the establishment of the committee. The British and French parliaments have been invited to send 25 representatives each to attend the preparatory meeting, Belgium and the Netherlands 11 each, and Luxembourg 3. The 75 representatives will make recommendations on the date and location of the first session of the Pan-European Parliament. Most importantly, they will decide which countries should be invited to participate. Given the complexity of the political environment, the five countries believe that initially only the current ten Marshall Plan countries, the three Western European occupation zones, and the Free Territory of Trieste should participate. Before European countries relinquish part of their sovereignty to a federal organization, the Pan-European Parliament will not have legislative or administrative power, but it will have the following functions: (1) Expressing the will of the European people for peace and unity; (2) Gradually considering practical methods for European political and economic unity; (3) Studying the constitutional, economic, and social problems necessary for the emergence of a European alliance; (4) Developing cultural ties so that Europeans can understand the basic principles of a common culture. More specifically, the parliament can also pass a charter of human rights, establish a European Supreme Court, and make recommendations to existing intergovernmental organizations. It should be noted that the Pan-European Assembly was proposed by the International Committee of the United Europe Movement at an unofficial conference convened in The Hague in May. At that time, the chairman was Churchill. Frenchmen Reynaud and Ramadier also attended and enthusiastically supported the movement, so the French government initiated the convening of the preparatory meeting.

### Hu Shih-tse Goes to France to Prepare for the Opening of the UN General Assembly

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 21st] Hu Shih-tse, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, departed for France today on the Queen Elizabeth to prepare for the UN General Assembly to be held in Paris in September. On board were Deputy Secretary-General Pullaies (United Kingdom), UK Representative to the Security Council Jebb, and Argentine Representative Arce.

### Wallace Launches Campaign, Denies Communist Presence in Third Party

[Agence France-Presse, Connecticut, August 21] Third Party presidential candidate Henry Wallace launched his campaign here tonight, denying the presence of communists within the Third Party. He vehemently denied that the Third Party is controlled by those who believe in overthrowing the government by force. Wallace accused the House Un-American Activities Committee of having "killed" former Treasury Department official Harry Dexter White. White passed away a few days ago due to a heart condition exacerbated by the HUAC hearings. Wallace further accused the leaders of the AFL and CIO of betraying the working class and supporting the government's bipartisan foreign policy. Union leaders who support the Truman Doctrine are no different from the Un-American Activities Committee in leading America towards fascism.

### Reports of Soviet Troop Movements Westward Towards Black Sea, Possible Action Against Yugoslavia; Another Two Yugoslav Officers Flee to Hungary

[Agence France-Presse, London, August 22] The Sunday Times reported this morning, citing a correspondent in Istanbul, that Soviet troops continue to move towards the Black Sea. The correspondent suggests that this troop movement may be in preparation for military action against Tito's Yugoslavia.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, August 21] The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ commented on the assassination of General Yovanovic and two other Yugoslav officials who attempted to flee to Romania, stating, "The unity of our party, the unity of our people's front, and the unity of our glorious army will not be shaken by this act of treason, but will be further strengthened."

[Associated Press, Budapest, August 21] It is reported that two Yugoslav officers have fled to Hungary, stating that "most" officers now oppose Marshal Tito. They were demoted and detained for opposing the anti-Soviet policies of the Yugoslav authorities.

### US Predicts New Soviet Protests over Teacher Case, Reports Suggest Soviet Consul General Lomakin Refuses to Leave US

[Associated Press, Washington, August 21] Officials awaiting Moscow's response to the recall of Consul General Lomakin stated on August 21st that the future of peace depends in part on whether the Kremlin receives accurate reports about America's firm policy towards the Soviet Union. Officials who have had contact with the Soviet Union have long suspected whether Soviet diplomatic representatives report the truth to Moscow, or tell them what they think Moscow wants to hear. The answer to this question is now crucial, as the Soviet Union may misunderstand America's position during a politically undecided presidential election campaign.

This issue was raised publicly when the State Department responded to the Soviet Union on August 20 regarding their lengthy protest over the case of the three defecting Soviet teachers, stating that it was based on "inaccurate reports from Lomakin." Lomakin was ordered to leave the country because of his grossly erroneous actions. Simultaneously, State Department officials predicted that Moscow would file a new protest regarding the case of the three teachers. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union will not let the strong action of demanding Lomakin's recall go unanswered. Some authoritative figures even believe that the Soviet Union will fabricate facts to attack American officials stationed in the Soviet Union in retaliation for Lomakin's expulsion. This would be the first such instance in the fifteen years since the two countries restored diplomatic relations. Generally, officials believe that the current tense international situation will not lead to war, unless the Soviet Union makes a serious error in its assessment of the American government's policy toward the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, August 21] When asked if Lomakin would leave, Mr. Tschaikovsky replied, "I believe he will stay here as the Soviet Deputy Consul." This answer has sparked rumors that Lomakin will resist the orders of the U.S. government. However, according to the Swedish American Line, Mr. Tschaikovsky and his family have booked passage on a Stockholm-bound ship, which will depart on August 28. The company declined to reveal whether the booking was made before or after the Kasenkina affair.

### Mrs. Kasenkina's Condition Greatly Improved, Announces New York Roosevelt Hospital

[Associated Press, New York, August 21] Mrs. Oksana Kasenkina, the Soviet teacher who fell from the window of the Soviet Consulate in New York, was removed from the critical list at Roosevelt Hospital on August 21. The hospital announced that Mrs. Kasenkina's condition had "greatly improved." At the same time, Mrs. Kasenkina's doctor, Dr. Panoye, wrote to Soviet Consul General Lomakin, reiterating that Mrs. Kasenkina "firmly requests not to be visited by Soviet consulate personnel." Dr. Panoye's letter stated that the hospital is not concerned with the political aspects of the case, but only with "the medical issues of curing Mrs. Kasenkina."

### US Air Force Conducts Firing Exercises in Mediterranean, Using Standard Weapons

[Associated Press, Tripoli, August 22] Eighteen US Air Force Thunderjet aircraft conducted special firing exercises in a secret area of the Mediterranean on August 22. Officials stated that the aircraft used standard weapons, but it has been repeatedly rumored that these fighter planes are equipped with "long-range weapons."

### US Special Envoy to Korea Flies to Seoul Today to Assume Post

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, August 22] US Special Representative to Korea, Muccio, with the rank of ambassador, will depart from here for Seoul tomorrow morning. Muccio arrived here from Washington a week ago en route to his new post in Korea.

### British Newspaper Criticizes Bevin's Diplomacy, Advocates Seeking Compromise with Soviet Union

[Associated Press, London, August 21] The Daily Mirror, a British newspaper with a circulation of three million, concluded its three-day critique of British foreign policy on August 21, suggesting that Western powers should tell the Soviet Union, "Eastern Europe is yours." The newspaper advocated "new contacts" with the Soviet Union that could lead to peace, concluding, "We need peace, and we have a better chance of achieving peace with a strong and secure Soviet Union than with a weak and insecure one." The Daily Mirror believes that the first step towards peace should be to reach a political settlement with the Soviet Union, and suggests that Britain and the United States should tell the Soviet Union: "(1) Eastern Europe is yours. We hope for reasonable trade facilities there. We may comment critically on political developments there, but we guarantee that we will not use any military pressure on what may be called your security zone. (2) We propose an agreement so that the Soviet Union can have the Middle Eastern oil resources it needs. We consider the Middle East to be our security zone and intend to maintain it. But we accept the right of others to share the gasoline, and we are prepared to give a distribution and the prices of the oil to be paid, decided by an international organization. (2) As a guarantee that the Soviet Union will never have any worries afterwards, we insist on the exchange condition that the German economy be restored as soon as possible. And adopt a policy by which the great powers bring about the unification of Germany within ten years."

### International Children's Fund Continues to Purchase Siamese Rice for Shipment to China

Poland Receives Large Supply of Replenishments

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, August 21] The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund has recently purchased another 1,550 metric tons of rice in Siam and will ship it to China before the end of August.

[Associated Press, Warsaw, August 22] Officials announced on August 22 that approximately 750,000 Polish children are receiving food supplements of 300 calories daily, thanks to the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund. In addition, 57,000 pregnant women are receiving special food supplements.

### Burma Announces State of Emergency and Martial Law, Reports Suggest China Sends Troops to Station on Burmese Border

[Central News Agency, Rangoon, August 21] Burmese President Sao Shwe Thaik issued a public statement tonight announcing that all of Burma is under a state of emergency effective immediately, and also announced martial law and supplementary articles to the constitution. Senior officials indicated that the government is taking these measures so that, under certain circumstances, the government authorities can take swift and effective steps. Observers believe that the announcement of these ordinances does not mean that the situation in Burma has worsened, but rather that they are preventive measures to deal with emergencies.

[Agence France-Presse, Rangoon, August 21] Indian radio broadcasts claimed that the Chinese government has dispatched a battalion of troops to the Burmese border to prevent Burmese insurgents from infiltrating Chinese territory.

### Israel Plans to Apply for Membership in United Nations, British Statement Indicates Lack of Support; After Warning, Fighting in Jerusalem Subsides

[Associated Press, Lake Success, August 21] Britain announced on August 21 that it will reject Israel's application to join the United Nations. British representative Cadogan stated that when Israel's application is submitted to the Security Council, he has not yet decided whether to use the veto power or abstain from voting, but he pointed out that Britain has not recognized the State of Israel and explicitly stated that Britain will not support a country it has not recognized.

Cadogan told reporters before departing for Paris to attend next month's United Nations General Assembly that Britain's final stance will depend on developments between now and the start of the conference. Israel's formal application has not yet been submitted, but a memorandum was circulated among members of the Security Council on August 20, requesting to join the United Nations, stating that if the United Nations does not accept it, it will threaten peace.

[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, August 22] The parliamentary subcommittee decided to set November 15 as the election date for Israel's constituent assembly.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, August 21] The United Nations announced that Jerusalem experienced unprecedented calm for the first time on August 21, five weeks after the start of the Palestinian ceasefire. This favorable development came only two days after the emergency meeting of the Security Council issued a strong warning to both Arab and Jewish sides, ordering all regular and irregular troops to immediately cease attacks. A United Nations press officer in Haifa telegraphed here, saying: "Today is one of the quietest days in Jerusalem since the start of the second ceasefire. Only rifle and machine gun fire were heard; artillery fire has completely ceased."

[Agence France-Presse, Amman, August 21] Amman announced that talks between Arabs and Jews in Jerusalem under the supervision of United Nations observers have been suspended due to unreasonable demands raised by the Jewish side. At the same time, Egyptian artillery continues to bombard the Arab University and agricultural school defended by Jewish forces. Scattered fighting occurs between both sides in the Beit Safafa district south of Jerusalem.

### Soviet Representative Storms Out of Jewish Capital Opera House, Because Theater Did Not Perform Soviet National Anthem

[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, August 22] Members of the Soviet delegation to Israel attended a performance of the opera "Thais" at the National Opera House on the evening of August 21. Because the theater only played the American anthem and not the Soviet national anthem, they angrily left. American representative McDonald and his daughter were also present that evening, so the theater played the American anthem to welcome them. The Soviet ambassador, Yerohov, was not personally present, so the theater was instructed not to play the Soviet national anthem.

### Australia and Soviet Union Sign New Trade Agreement

### Soviet Union Accuses United States of Monopolizing South American Economy, US Holds 80% of Oil Production

[Associated Press, Geneva, August 22] Soviet representative Arutiunian to the United Nations Economic and Social Council accused the United States on August 22 of "systematically stifling" the South American economy through its monopoly. He stated that half of the South American economy is colonial and is controlled by foreign capital. American companies control 87 percent of Colombia's oil production, with the rest being owned by British companies.

### Prelude to the American Election IV: Cannon Hero Wallace

— Our Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

[Special Dispatch from New York, August 13] In the 1948 American election arena, Henry Wallace can be considered the number one "hero"! Last month, Philadelphia held Wallace's "party founding conference," and their slogan was: "War or Wallace?" Wallace not only symbolizes the future "God of Peace," but also symbolizes that the world's various chaos since the end of World War II is entirely due to the lack of Wallace. On the seat of the Philadelphia Conference, Wallace proudly said: "If I had become the President of the United States after Mr. Roosevelt's death, there would be no so-called Berlin Crisis today!"

Why is that? Because the Soviet Union trusts Wallace. At the Third Party's opening ceremony, Black lawyer Howard Dodd once said: "The Soviet Union has always been seeking world peace. It is because the United States lacks ruling great politicians that US-Soviet relations have reached this point!" Wallace himself highly treasures the private letters that Stalin gave him. He said: If he can be elected President of the United States, he will definitely be able to discuss world peace with Stalin openly. Therefore, "all those who do not want war again, come and elect me!"

The Third Party's declaration stated: War between the Western powers and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly a victory for fascism and death. "Only peace is the only way for mankind to survive." It also said: "The cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union will greatly help world peace." How to cooperate? The declaration mentioned "canceling the Marshall Plan for European Aid and stopping aid to the corrupt governments of Greece and Turkey." In the United States, "immediately cancel the peacetime conscription bill," because the conscription bill has a suspicion of "preparing for war," and preparing for war is hostility towards the Soviet Union.

When Wallace and his colleagues were holding a meeting, it was the most tense time of the "Berlin Crisis." Many people asked Wallace, how should he deal with the Berlin Crisis? Wallace said very simply: "The United States withdraws from Berlin." In order not to offend the Soviet Union and to seek "world peace," Wallace believed that there was no need for American troops to remain in Berlin.

All American newspapers published Wallace's shocking claims. New York Herald Tribune reporter Thomas Stokes sent a telegram from Philadelphia saying: "That is a terrible group, a group of terrible communist conspirators, manipulating the venue, plus a group of ignorant youths who don't know the immensity of the sky and the earth, waving flags and shouting slogans there with a simple ideal." He said: "Wallace himself is not a communist, but what he says and does has lost reason and is completely manipulated by the communists." New York Daily News reporter O'Donnell wrote: "Wallace's conference is a terrible phantom, a conspiracy under the direction of the Kremlin, fooling the youth educated under the morbid American education system!"

Wallace himself firmly denied that he was being manipulated by the Communist Party. At a press conference at the Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, a large group of American journalists pressed him about his relationship with the Communist Party. Wallace was initially unwilling to speak, but the reporters repeatedly forced him to answer, which caused this 1948 election hero to go from embarrassment to anger. He believed that the gossip reporters controlled by American capitalists were deliberately causing trouble for him. Some smart reporters explained from the side: "We don't mean to make things difficult for you, we just want to know a definite answer for news reporting!" After this explanation, Wallace felt a little more at peace. He said: "If anyone says that the Communist Party is manipulating our founding conference, that is completely absurd slander. Today, many people on the right say that I, Wallace, am a communist. The real communists say that I am a progressive capitalist. The reason why the Communist Party supports me is entirely because I advocate cooperation with the Soviet Union!"

Wallace's "running mate," the Third Party's vice-presidential candidate Taylor, said even more humorously that the Communist Party advocates armed revolution to overthrow the current government. "All those who sympathize with our Third Party this time are relatively less crimson, and are more like light red communist followers. You must know that true, deep crimson, genuine Communist Party members would rather support the Republican Party and would rather elect Dewey." Why is that? Because genuine Communist Party members "hope that there will be another Hoover and another economic panic."

Although the explanation was very humorous, suspicions between the Third Party and the Communist Party still arose endlessly inside and outside the conference. When the conference declaration was being read and seconded at the conference, a delegate named James Loeb, a member of the American Democratic Movement, said angrily: "The draft declaration is being manipulated by the Communist Party. We cannot so definitely agree with everything the Soviet Union does. We cannot say that everything the Soviet Union does is good!" Another delegate, Michael Torney, a veteran of the American labor movement and a member of Congress, argued that the declaration should not be too pro-Soviet and should not be too inclined towards the Communist Party. As soon as he finished speaking, he aroused the anger of some radical elements. Dr. Tugwell from Chicago, the chairman of the declaration drafting committee, was the first to oppose the amendment. He said: The Soviet Union is peace-loving, and the Third Party cannot lack the friendship of the Soviet Union. Dr. Jonesstown, dean of the medical school at Howard University, and Pressman, the person in charge of the New York Third Party campaign headquarters, who was later involved in the international spy case, all stood up to denounce the so-called "amendment." Tugwell also solemnly reminded the conference delegates: "Treasure the price of unity and recognize the danger of differing opinions."

Tugwell was full of Roosevelt. He said he understood President Roosevelt more deeply than anyone else. He said: "If Roosevelt were still alive today, he would definitely sympathize with the Third Party's platform and policies." He also said that one day Roosevelt was chatting with him, and Roosevelt said that the Democratic Party would inevitably split in the future. Because of historical factors, the Democratic Party could not implement many of his plans. President Roosevelt also predicted that a "Progressive Party" would appear in the future.

The Third Party was officially named the "Progressive Party," perhaps based on this reason. Originally, since Wallace announced the formation of a party and ran for election last December, most Americans knew that Wallace had a political party, but they didn't know what party it was? Wallace himself said: "I want to run for election as the president of progressive American citizens." Outsiders called him the "New Party" or the "Third Party." It was not until this Philadelphia founding conference that it was officially named the "Progressive Party."

In fact, the name Progressive Party is not Tugwell's new creation. In American history, this is the third time there has been a Progressive Party. As early as 1912, Theodore Roosevelt and Johnson organized the Progressive Party and ran for president. As a result, they won 27% of the national vote but were unsuccessful. In 1924, La Follette and Wheeler also organized the Progressive Party and won 16% of the vote, but they were also unsuccessful. The organization of the Progressive Party was a flash in the pan and soon disappeared. The New York Times said: The Progressive Party easily gains the support of residents of big cities, but is too far removed from the people of the whole country. The Times also said: The previous Progressive Party was relatively simple. Now that the Communist Party is sandwiched in the middle, it is of course more complicated. What will be the outcome of this year's Progressive Party in the future? That depends on how this big "hero" Wallace does it.

### If Diet is Not Dissolved, Two Parties Will Split; Japanese Cabinet Will Inevitably Resign; Socialist Party Chairman Katayama Warns Prime Minister Ashida

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, August 21] Japanese Social Democratic Party Chairman Tetsu Katayama warned Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida yesterday that if the current government attempts to prevent the dissolution of the Diet in order to maintain power, the total resignation of the cabinet will ultimately be unavoidable. This is the second time that former Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama has publicly expressed the Social Democratic Party's determination to dissolve the current Diet. Prime Minister Ashida recently issued a statement saying that he had not found any reason to dissolve the current Diet and that the government would use all its power to avoid this. Katayama's warning was issued in response to Prime Minister Ashida's statement.

Kanjuro Kato, the Labor Minister of the Ashida Cabinet affiliated with the left wing of the Social Democratic Party, supported Tetsu Katayama and told the Japanese press yesterday that he and other left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party agreed with the proposal to dissolve the Diet as soon as possible. Tetsu Katayama, who is currently on a speaking tour in Hokkaido, told Japanese reporters yesterday morning, commenting on Ashida's recent statement, that Ashida's efforts to avoid dissolving the Diet would be ineffective and would only deepen the rift between the Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party. Tetsu Katayama pointed out that the differences of opinion between the two parties have become more apparent due to long-standing debates over issues such as the recent revision of wage standards and the Civil Service Law. Dissolving the current Diet is the only way to avoid the breakup of the two parties; otherwise, the conflicting policies of the two parties will eventually lead to the total resignation of the current cabinet.

[Shinya News Agency, Tokyo, August 22] Prime Minister Ashida said in Takaoka City on August 21: "The dissolution of the Diet will be avoided as much as possible before the end of this year. One of the reasons is to fully materialize the contents of the MacArthur documents, and the second is to complete the posture of accepting foreign investment. I personally believe that the work of the Central League will be successful, and as a result, the Democratic Party will become the first party, but for this reason, the Democratic Party itself must be drastically reformed, but not a reform that provokes scandals."

During the meeting, Deputy Minister Xu Boyuan presented details of the allocated reserves, which included cash reserves comprising gold, silver, and foreign exchange totaling US$200 million. The discounted prices for gold and silver were both below market prices. Gold was valued at US$35 per ounce, while the actual market price was US$50.

The committee has dispatched personnel to negotiate the takeover and safekeeping of these assets, to reinforce the reserves and maintain confidence in the currency.

[Our Newspaper] The first day of Gold Standard Note issuance begins today, along with the exchange of Legal Tender. In addition to the Central Bank and its branches handling the exchange, the Central Bank has also entrusted the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the Central Trust, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the Central Cooperative Treasury, and the provincial banks of each province and their branches to handle the exchange.

### Bank Exchanges of Negotiable Instruments Converted to Gold Standard Currency

(Our Newspaper) The Shanghai Clearing House resumes operations today (the 23rd) and, starting today, all bank exchanges of negotiable instruments will be based on the Gold Standard Currency. There are four points to this effect: (1) Starting August 23, 1948, all negotiable instruments presented for exchange by banks will be based on the Gold Standard Currency. (2) Legal Tender notes should be handled in accordance with Article 4 of the "Points for Attention Regarding Currency Reform within Banks" formulated by the Banking, Money, and Trust Associations. (3) The Clearing House has already printed exchange forms with corner and cent units. If banks' original forms do not have corner and cent units, please come to the Clearing House to exchange them. If the original forms have spaces for corners and cents but do not explicitly state the words "corner" and "cent," please fill them in yourselves. (4) For payment slips and transfer application forms originally used by banks with the words "National Currency" printed on them, banks should add a stamp with the words "Gold Standard" and continue to use them as usual.

The Clearing House was closed yesterday for a regular holiday, but it continued to operate as usual, rushing to convert the account books of all member banks to the Gold Standard Currency and accepting applications from clearing banks numbered 50 and beyond to the Central Bank, so that banks could receive Gold Standard Notes to meet today's market needs.

### Short-Term Treasury Bills Decided to Be Temporarily Suspended

[Our Newspaper] It has been learned that after the issuance of Gold Standard Notes, the issuance of short-term treasury bills will be temporarily suspended.

Furthermore, starting today, state-owned banks and bureaus will abolish all remittance commissions, only charging handling fees, and stipulating that the handling fee shall not exceed one Gold Standard Note.

### State-Owned Banks Allow Banks to Borrow Funds Temporarily for Turnover

[Our Newspaper] Banks and money shops in this city were ordered to close temporarily for two days on August 20 and 21. August 22 was a regular Sunday holiday, and today marks their official reopening. At the same time, the government is beginning to issue Gold Standard Notes nationwide today, implementing the new currency system. The Central Bank, in view of the frequent payment transactions between banks and their customers at the beginning of the currency system's implementation, and the potential difficulties in cash flow for a small number of banks, has decided to temporarily allow banks to borrow Gold Standard Notes from state-owned banks by discounting the government-issued 1947 US Dollar Bonds, short-term treasury bills, and listed securities, in order to meet temporary needs. However, the aforementioned designated government marketable securities must be owned by the banks themselves. As for listed stocks, they must be loan collaterals received by the banks and must have records available for verification. It is reported that when the State-Owned Banks' Business Bureau handles these temporary loans, the Gold Control Bureau will dispatch auditors to conduct strict audits to prevent irregularities.

### Declarations by Two Business Groups Support Emergency Financial and Economic Measures; Everyone Should Have the Determination That "Hoarding Currency is Better Than Hoarding Goods"

The Shanghai Industrial Association and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce jointly issued a declaration yesterday in support of the emergency financial and economic measures. The original text is as follows:

It has been three years since the victory. Due to the increased issuance of currency and the daily depreciation of its value, commodity prices have soared, causing great suffering to the people. The practical lessons are obvious to everyone today, without the need for further explanation. On the 19th of this month, the government resolutely issued an emergency financial and economic decree, ordering currency reform. Considering the crisis, there can be no further delay. Considering the conditions, there are many difficulties ahead. After careful calculation, it issued this decisive measure, which is naturally a good medicine for the situation. The whole country supports it, with everyone sharing the same sentiment. However, support is just lip service, while trust is a real need. Everyone must trust that the government is determined to reform the currency system, that the issuance is limited, and that the reserves are supervised. The main root cause of past price fluctuations has been removed. Therefore, the government's order that the prices of various goods and services in all regions should be converted to Gold Standard Currency based on the prices on August 19, 1948, and sold accordingly, should be observed and followed by the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai. From now on, everyone should have the determination that "hoarding currency is better than hoarding goods," wash away the psychological tremors and doubts of the past decade, and then commodity prices can be permanently stabilized, without turning back and rising again, so that commodity prices and the currency system will not be in a never ending competition. To make everyone have the idea that "hoarding currency is better than hoarding goods," the government must provide better protection for those who can save, so that they will not be sacrificed under the currency system again. At a time when military affairs are not yet settled and national expenses are enormous, we would rather endure hardship, strictly adhere to the limits, and never issue an extra note, so as not to undermine the credibility that is about to be established. Then this currency reform can become the first major achievement after the victory. It must be known that, compared from any aspect, this currency reform is far less superior in conditions than the Legal Tender policy of 1935, and far less favorable in environment than the victory at the beginning of 1945. Today's currency reform is like an isolated army trapped in an encirclement, which can only win and not fail. Only when the people and the government work together, and the government and the people are of one mind, can we say that we are out of the encirclement. Today's matter is just the beginning of a preliminary experiment. Confidence must be had, but we must not be optimistic or pessimistic. It must be known that optimists will fail, and pessimists will fail even more. Only when the city's industry and commerce realize that this is related to the survival of the people, that the opportunity cannot come again, that they abandon their selfish and opportunistic mentality, and wholeheartedly support this national policy, can the currency reform be successful. Finally, the associations place their greatest expectations on the members of the Issuance Preparatory Supervisory Committee, who will restore the currency system's credibility that has been undermined for ten years, which is equivalent to reviving the economic life of 450 million people. The responsibility is placed on your shoulders. Thinking of this, we are both happy and fearful. "Drawing water from the well is too far away," and "Wei Que's fears are not new." Respectfully urge the gentlemen to display their martial virtues, and the people will be fortunate. This is just a declaration.

### Currency Reform Halts Printing of Customs Gold Units, Printing Workers Fear Unemployment

Since the currency reform, the printing of Customs Gold Units has been ordered to stop. The printing workers at Datong and Zhonghua Book Company have switched to printing books. However, about 6,000 workers at the Central and Daye printing factories have had no work to do since the printing of banknotes was stopped. Fearing that the authorities may dismiss them, they are extremely anxious and have been holding emergency meetings in recent days to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that the authorities have approved the continued printing of subsidiary coins or dismissal, which is currently under consideration and will be formally decided today.

### Shanghai and Tianjin Stock Exchanges Unlikely to Reopen Soon

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] After the Shanghai and Tianjin Stock Exchanges were ordered to suspend operations, Wang Zhixin, the person in charge of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, went to Nanjing to meet with Wang Yunwu and Chen Qitian, requesting an early resumption. However, according to relevant sources, this is unlikely. At least until November 21, when the old Legal Tender completely ceases to circulate, the Shanghai and Tianjin Stock Exchanges are unlikely to resume operations.

### Stock Exchange Continues to Suspend Operations; Settlement Methods Resolved Yesterday; Wang Zhixin to Go to Nanjing Again to Request Reopening

For settlement prices of Type A and Type B treasury bonds, deferred interest of 7 jiao Legal Tender will be added per day, totaling 2.1 yuan Legal Tender for three days, which will be converted to Gold Standard Notes and settled together.

[Additional News] General Manager Wang Zhixin of the Stock Exchange plans to go to Nanjing again this Thursday to request instructions from the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the reopening of the Stock Exchange.

### Designated Banks Hope to Supply Foreign Exchange Funds

[Our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of a designated bank: After the currency reform, the new currency Gold Standard Note is rigidly set at a rate of 4 to 1 against the US dollar, and the price of foreign exchange will not fluctuate in the future. The designated banks still hope that the Central Bank will supply foreign exchange funds to facilitate the settlement of foreign exchange for importers. After the implementation of the new currency measures, it is expected that foreign exchange brokers will be hit hard due to the stability of foreign exchange market prices.

### Liu Weizhi Discusses Overseas Remittances

Believes the Government Should Offer More Incentives

Mr. Liu Weizhi, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, made a statement in response to a reporter's question about the impact of currency reform on overseas remittances. He believes that the stability of the new currency will eliminate the need to evade overseas remittances, and that revenue from overseas remittances can be increased. However, whether the future can be permanently optimistic depends on the stability of the overall situation. Mr. Liu said: Overseas remittances can be divided into the following two categories according to their nature: (1) Family support expenses. Since overseas remittances no longer need to go through the black market, these remittances can return to government control. (2) Investment. This amount accounted for a large proportion before the war. If the government can maintain currency credit for a long time and the overall situation gradually stabilizes, the number of overseas remittances returning to the country for investment will inevitably increase. Mr. Liu pointed out that overseas remittances reached 300 million yuan per year before the war, accounting for about 40% of the fiscal budget at that time. Although most countries other than the United States restrict remittances from overseas Chinese, there is still hope that revenue from overseas remittances will reach 100 million US dollars per year in the future. Mr. Liu concluded: Even if the situation is favorable to overseas remittances, the government should still offer more incentives. In my personal opinion, the restrictions on the methods of importing overseas Chinese capital announced by the Import and Export Control Commission need to be further relaxed.

### Strictly Limit Prices to August 19; Economic Police Monitor All Industries and Markets

[Our Newspaper] The police's economic police brigade has been ordered to closely monitor all industries and markets starting today. If it is found that brokers are trading at prices exceeding those of August 19, they will be arrested and severely punished according to the law. The black market trading of gold and banknotes is still strictly prohibited. Once discovered, they will be sent to the Special Criminal Court for severe punishment.

The Shanghai Commodity Survey Institute will convert the Legal Tender market prices of various commodities in this city on "August 19" into Gold Standard Notes and print them into a special table. In addition to submitting them to relevant agencies for reference, all sectors can contact the institute directly if they need them (the address is 519 Fuzhou Road, 1st floor).

### Four Joint Branch Resolved Yesterday on Domestic Remittance Fees

Since the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Decree, the work of the Shanghai Four Joint Branch and the State Bank Bureau has been extremely tense. On the 20th, 21st, and 22nd, the internal affairs were still operating as usual, actively preparing for the new measures after the opening on Monday. In order to make the Shanghai State Bank Bureau's business cooperate with government orders, the Four Joint Branches also held a temporary meeting in the afternoon of the 22nd to conduct a detailed review of how the deposit and remittance business should cooperate with government orders thereafter. As for domestic remittances, it has also been decided that the flat remittance fee will be 5 jiao per thousand yuan for this province, and 1 yuan per ten yuan for other provinces. The minimum handling fee for each remittance is 1 jiao. For remote areas where the Central Bank does not provide head-office allocation, the handling fee may be appropriately increased, which will be implemented from today. Postage will not be charged, and telegram fees will be handled in accordance with the general regulations of the Four Joint Branch.

### Gasoline Restores Old Prices; Costs are Very High

The prices of gasoline, diesel, and other fuels have been restored to the August 19 prices by the oil companies in compliance with government orders. It is reported that the so-called August 19 prices were actually approved by the Import and Export Control Commission on August 5, based on a rate of 6.33 million Legal Tender per US dollar and a workers' cost of living index of 1.86 million times for the first half of the month. By August 15, the US dollar had risen to 8.36 million Legal Tender, and the workers' cost of living index had also risen to 3.63 million times for the second half of the month. The oil companies applied to adjust prices, and the Import and Export Control Commission approved them on the 19th. Now, in order to comply with the new decree and restore the old prices, but the new currency system sets each US dollar at 4 Gold Standard Notes, and each Gold Standard Note at 3 million Legal Tender. According to this conversion, each US dollar is actually equivalent to 12 million Legal Tender, which is more than double the 6.33 million yuan used before the pricing on August 5. In this situation, the oil companies' selling prices will naturally not cover the costs. The source of oil becomes worrisome. The foreign exchange expenditure for oil is too high. Users must also strive to save on the use of oil to reduce the burden on our country.

### Confucius Society Advocates Confucius Birthday Scholarship Movement

The Confucius Society has set the Confucius Birthday Festival (Teachers' Day) on the 27th of this month to participate in the Confucius ritual at the West Gate Temple.

### Yasuji Okamura to Be Publicly Tried Today; Leaders from Nanjing and Shanghai Will Attend

[Our Newspaper] Yasuji Okamura, the number one Japanese war criminal, will be publicly tried at the Shanghai Municipal Council on Tanggu Road starting at 9:30 AM today. The military court converted the auditorium on the third floor of the Municipal Council into a temporary court yesterday afternoon and installed sound equipment. The auditorium can accommodate about 500 to 600 people to listen. As of yesterday, the military court had issued about 500 admission tickets, and also invited the heads of various agencies in the capital and this city, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries, to attend the trial. It is reported that Xu Yedao, director of the Military Law Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, Pan Gongzhan, speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and representatives from the United States Information Service will attend. The Central Film Studio will also film the trial to keep a record. It is expected that there will be an unprecedented scene in court today.

### Bankers Association Resolves to Lower Deposit and Loan Interest Rates; No Conclusion on Capital Increase; Decides to Ask for Assistance from the State Bank

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Bankers Association convened a temporary meeting of directors and supervisors at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss interest rates on deposits and loans between banks, as well as capital increase issues. Representatives from the money industry and trust industry associations were also present. The meeting was personally presided over by Chairman Li Ming. Regarding interest rates, it was decided that, starting from the 20th of this month, the interbank overnight deposit interest rate would be reduced from the original 2.4 yuan per thousand Legal Tender to 1 Gold Standard Note (equivalent to 3% monthly interest). The interbank overnight loan interest rate would be reduced from the original 15 yuan per thousand Legal Tender to 5 Gold Standard Notes (equivalent to 1.5% monthly interest). The interbank overnight discount and public treasury certificate discount interest rate would be reduced from the original 13 yuan per thousand Legal Tender to 3 Gold Standard Notes (equivalent to 0.9% monthly interest).

The issue of capital increase was discussed in detail, but no conclusion was reached due to the complexity of the issue. The meeting believed that the various expenses of the current financial business cannot be reduced for a while, and the deposit capital strength will inevitably be reduced after the currency conversion, making the capital increase even more difficult, and there is no definite certainty about the future of the business. This time, they reluctantly sacrificed, lowered the interest rate, and reduced it by two-thirds, which had a considerable impact on the business. In the future, it will be necessary for the State Bank to quickly promote rediscount and mortgage policies to support the financial industry. Finally, it was resolved that the banking, money, and trust industry associations would jointly submit a request to Governor Yu of the State Bank, stating the above opinions, hoping to provide instructions and guidance on how to supply the market with the legitimate operating funds of the industry in the future, and how to moderate the deposit and loan interest rates.

[Additional News] Li Ming, chairman of the National Bankers Association Federation and the Shanghai Bankers Association, Qin Runqing, chairman of the National Money Industry Association Federation, Xi Rixin, chairman of the Shanghai Money Industry Association, and Yan Chengde, acting chairman of the Shanghai Trust Industry Association, jointly telegraphed the President yesterday, expressing their unanimous support for the Financial and Economic Emergency Decree.

### City Industrial Association Established Yesterday; Over Fifty Important Cases Passed; Leaders Urge Industrial and Commercial Cooperation and Labor-Management Coordination

[Report from Our Newspaper] The inaugural meeting of the City Industrial Association was held at 9:00 a.m. yesterday in the auditorium of the Pudong Native Place Association. Two hundred and thirty-three representatives from various industrial trade associations attended. Government officials present included Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs; Gu Baochang, Director of the Department representing Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; Lu Jingshi, Vice Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Industry; Wu Guozhen, Mayor of Shanghai; and Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau.

The opening ceremony began promptly at 9:00 a.m. Du Yuesheng was elected chairman by the presidium to lead the proceedings. Mr. Du delivered the opening remarks, stating briefly: "Today marks the completion of the preparatory work for the Shanghai City Industrial Association and the convening of its inaugural meeting, which is also a grand gathering of unity for the industrial sector of this city. We are greatly honored to have senior officials from the central government, local administrative leaders, and guests from all walks of life present to observe the ceremony. Rewarding production is clearly stipulated in the Constitution, and increasing production to build the nation has been established by the government as a national policy. The responsibilities of the industrial sector cannot be underestimated. This city is the center of gravity for industry in the entire country, the place from which modern equipment is introduced, and the basis for regulating international trade. The industrial sector here is interconnected and shares a common destiny with the industrial sectors throughout the country. During the Anti-Japanese War, the sector suffered significant losses due to relocation, dispersal, and destruction. However, since the restoration, it has made vigorous efforts to recover. Responding to the international environment and mindful of national survival, we in the industrial sector must unite and work in harmony to contribute to the country. Now that the Industrial Association has been established, a collective unity is being established to seek welfare and correct abuses. The steps and strength are all endowed by laws and regulations, and we should all work together to encourage each other. We also hope that government officials and leaders from all sectors will provide guidance to serve as a compass." Afterwards, Pan Shihao, Secretary-General of the Congress, reported on the preparatory process, detailing the convening of the sponsors' meeting on June 1st this year at the Lido Garden, the drafting of the association's charter, and the solicitation of members. After Secretary-General Pan's report, he invited the government officials and guests to deliver speeches.

Work Together to Achieve Soundness

Minister Gu delivered an instruction, stating briefly: "The completion of the organization of the Shanghai City Industrial Association and its official establishment today are sufficient to indicate the great potential for the future development of Chinese industry. Shanghai is the industrial center of the country, and the establishment of the Industrial Association here can serve as a leader for industrial associations nationwide. I have three points: (1) To enable industrial development, we should overcome all external and internal difficulties. To overcome external difficulties, we should first improve the technical and management issues within the industrial sector itself. We must all work together in unity, deeply believing that this is strength, so that the organization of the Industrial Association becomes more sound. (2) Industrial and commercial cooperation and labor-management coordination. Under today's national social labor policy, we must strive to promote labor-management coordination and work closely with the industrial and commercial sectors. The development of the industrial sector itself also promotes the development of the commercial sector. (3) After the government implements new economic measures, it will not only safeguard the country but also the entire industry. Therefore, we hope that the industrial sector will play a role in coordination and leadership."

Assisting the Government in Overcoming Difficulties

Mayor Wu stated briefly: "Today, the establishment of the Shanghai City Industrial Association is directly related to the construction and prosperity of Shanghai, and indirectly affects the construction and prosperity of the entire country. The greatest strength of our country is in Shanghai, and the greatest strength of Shanghai is in industry. The industrial sector can make the currency reform plan successful, help the government, and also help itself solve various problems. If we do this, we will succeed. Today, with the establishment of your association, the people of the city and even the people of the whole country are sincerely praying for success. We hope that you will exert your strength to assist the government in overcoming the current difficulties and successfully completing the economic reform."

Director Wu stated briefly: "After the victory, I, standing in the position of the competent authority, fully understand the difficult situation of the industrial sector. In the past, because the industrial sector lacked a unified organization, it could not plan and solve difficulties in a comprehensive way. Most of the time, they fought on their own without a leading organization to solve problems comprehensively. After the establishment of the Industrial Association, it will definitely be of great help to the future of the industrial sector. The establishment of the Industrial Association is taking place after the currency reform. The stability of the new currency system will be of great help to the industrial sector. We hope that everyone will work together to cooperate with the government's policies to realize them. Finally, I hope that the Industrial Association and the General Labor Union will have more contact, coordinate labor-management relations, and implement the Kuomintang's labor-management policy."

To Share Weal and Woe with the Government

Speaker Pan delivered a speech: "With the establishment of your association today, the industrial sector has a bright hope. The reason is that the government is promulgating orders for currency reform and economic innovation. In the past, the industrial sector was oppressed by high prices, high wages, and high interest rates, making it impossible to breathe. Now that we have these four reform measures, as long as the people of society support them and sincerely help the government implement them, these measures will definitely succeed. The establishment of your association today is the first organization and force to support these measures. We believe that the more than 9,000 factories belonging to the industrial sector will definitely support these measures. The government must trust the people, must trust the good people, and those engaged in industrial production are all good. Only those who escape funds abroad and whose chimneys do not smoke are not good. Our good industrial production must share weal and woe with the government, and we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and strive for a bright future for the industrial sector."

Subsequently, Xu Jiyin, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, delivered speeches one after another, expressing their willingness to cooperate with the Industrial Association to promote it and stabilize the lives of workers and promote labor-management coordination. Finally, Chairman Shu Yunyi delivered a thank-you speech.

Pass a Telegram to the President to Pay Respects

The meeting then discussed the charter and budget proposal, and appointed members of various review committees. At 12:30 p.m., the chairman announced a recess. All representatives had lunch at the venue, and the review committees used their spare time after lunch to review the proposals. The assembly resumed at 2:00 p.m. to elect directors and supervisors.

(3) Asking the government to seriously consider opening trade relations with Japan to safeguard national industry. (4) The business tax on manufacturing should be uniformly reduced by half in accordance with the law. (5) Establishing a joint venture company for export industrial products to develop foreign trade. (6) Opening foreign exchange, strictly implementing protectionist trade, and prohibiting the import of luxury goods and manufactured products that are already produced in the country. (7) Regarding the fuel coal and diesel required by steel smelting factories, the government should supply them in sufficient quantities to facilitate production. (8) Asking the government to restore the same-day cashing of checks to facilitate capital turnover. (9) Opening industrial loans to maintain the survival of factories. Finally, a telegram was passed to President Chiang to pay respects.

As for the soaring prices of vegetables and other daily necessities in recent days, the Social Affairs Bureau will, in accordance with regulations, ensure that they do not exceed the highest price on the 19th of this month, and will strictly ban them today. The price of rice will also be restricted. Those who violate this and deliberately raise market prices will be severely punished.

### Minister Gu Returns to Nanjing Today

Hoping Factories to Focus on Inspection Work

Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning to attend the inaugural meeting of the City Industrial Association. According to Gu's interview with the Central News Agency reporter, the issue of wage calculation for employees of private enterprises in this city should be in accordance with the 13th, 14th, 22nd, and 23rd articles of the Regulations for Reorganizing Finance and Strengthening Control of the Economy, and the Social Affairs Bureau should formulate methods with reference to the actual situation. He also participated in yesterday's meeting convened by Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau with the responsible parties of the City General Labor Union to discuss this issue. Gu also answered a reporter's question regarding the handling of the unfortunate incident at the Yongbei Underwear Factory. He believes that in the future, factory inspection work will be actively promoted to promote factory safety, and he hopes that each factory should have a deep understanding of factory inspection work. Taking the Yongbei Underwear Factory as an example, factory inspection can not only promote labor-management coordination, but also ensure the safety of life and property between labor and management. Regarding the refugee relief incident and the immigrant reclamation issue, the Ministry of Social Affairs is now planning to handle it in Jiangxi and Suiyuan provinces. This plan has been contacted several times with the two provinces of Jiangxi and Suiyuan, and the principles have been determined. What remains to be determined is the technical issue, which is currently being actively carried out and will be completed soon. After attending the wage issue talk meeting with Director Wu yesterday noon, Gu went to the Pudong Workers' Welfare Committee to inspect and participate in the welcome meeting of the committee. In the evening, he attended a dinner hosted by Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai City Industrial Association. This morning, after attending the Children's First Aid Fund meeting, he took the night train back to Nanjing.

### Comfort Items for Soldiers in the Central Plains Will Be Transported to the Front Lines for Distribution

In view of the great victory in eastern Henan, the National Comfort Association for Suppression of Rebellion Soldiers organized a Central Plains Comfort Group, with Zhang Fang and Xie Renzhao serving as the leaders and deputy leaders respectively, to comfort the troops in Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Shangqiu, and other places. In response, the Shanghai City Comfort and Fundraising Committee, in addition to allocating 20 billion yuan in comfort money, also launched a campaign among the guilds and factories in Shanghai to donate comfort items. As of August 20, the committee received 4,116 woolen blankets, 2,699 toothbrushes, 3,348 packages of toothpaste, 876 tubes of toothpaste, 238 cartons of cigarettes, 101 pairs of running shoes, 1,172 bottles of medicine, and 329 other items. It is reported that the comfort items have been paid to the group and will soon be transported to the front lines for the soldiers to use. In addition, famous opera singers (from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.) and famous actors and actresses (from 4:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. the next morning) will broadcast famous songs and raise 10,000 gold yuan in aid to education to rescue young people who are out of school. It has also been decided to host a reception for the opera performers at the New World Jingu Hotel at 3:00 p.m. on the 25th to discuss the selection of activities, and to host a reception for the news media that evening at 7:00 p.m. It is hoped that all sectors will enthusiastically donate to promote the spirit of respecting Confucius and teachers and do their best in the movement to promote education.

### Passenger and Freight Transportation Prices for Land, Sea, and Air to Be Calculated in Gold Yuan Notes Starting Today

Under the Currency Reform Order, the prices of ship, airplane, and train transportation will be calculated in gold yuan notes starting today. Before the new fare is approved by the Ministry of Communications, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau will temporarily calculate it at the original price. The bureau issued a notice yesterday ordering all station passenger and freight ticket offices and business offices to collect passenger and freight transportation revenue from August 23 in legal tender as required, and all will be converted into gold yuan notes. Fractions below one cent will be rounded to the nearest five cents.

### New Prices for Shipping Passenger and Freight Transportation Will Be Higher Than Pre-War Standards

In order to cooperate with the central government's currency reform, the shipping industry will set new standards for passenger fares and freight prices. According to Xu Xueyu, General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the calculation method for new passenger and freight prices was determined yesterday, and Li Yunliang, Yuan Hushi, and three others have been appointed as representatives to go to Nanjing today (the 22nd) to ask the Ministry of Communications for instructions. This time the new price will be higher than the pre-war standard, because the pre-war price of lump coal was 11 yuan per ton, while the current price is more than 50 gold yuan notes. The pre-war price of diesel was 36 yuan per ton, while the current price is more than 1 million yuan. The pre-war price of hardware was 17 cents, while the current price is more than 1 yuan. However, in order to avoid stimulating prices, it will be slightly increased.

### Economic Promotion by the Public Works Bureau; Water Supply Project in West Shanghai

In order to solve the water shortage in West Shanghai, the Municipal Public Works Bureau implemented an emergency project last year, completed deep wells and reservoir pumping stations, and successively opened new users to more than 200 households. This year, it will implement a plan to connect the inland tap water plant, adding a pumping station at Xietu Road, laying 400 meters of trench pipes in Wanping Road and other places, and equipping electromechanical equipment and other equipment. Among the projects that have been completed, there are the Xietu Road pumping station building, the Huiji Road water pipe bridge, the giant high-pressure pumping machine, and various water pipe accessories. The 18-inch diameter water pipe laying project on Wanping Road has also been 90% completed, and it will be connected to Hengshan Road within days. The French side's existing 24-inch special pipe leads directly to the large reservoir in West Zhongzheng Road. The motor and machine installation project of the Xietu Road pumping station is only waiting for the pipeline, accessories, and power equipment to be rushed. In addition, water meter station projects, if the funds are allocated, can also be completed in one month. It is reported that after the completion of the entire project, more than 7,000 tons of water can be supplied every day, which is equivalent to the water consumption of more than 100,000 people. By then, the water supply situation in West Shanghai will be more ideally resolved.

### Fifty Billion from the 88 Fundraising Movement to Be Used for the Shenbao Scholarship

### Zhu Zhengwen Hosts All Sectors to Report and Expose the Truth about Deng Zhonghe; Analyzes Four Points and Awaits Judicial Resolution

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Deng Zhonghe being accused of being a traitor is currently being investigated by the High Prosecutor's Office. In addition to filing a private prosecution with the District Court against Deng for libel, claiming that Deng referred to him as an "extortion bandit," the original accuser, Zhu Zhengwen, hosted all sectors at the Xianlesi Dance Palace yesterday afternoon to report the accusations. To clarify his identity and the circumstances of his underground work during the war, Zhu placed the awards and Victory Medals awarded by the former National Government in front of him, which attracted attention. According to Zhu's report: (1) His accusation against Deng Zhonghe for being a traitor is based on facts and all the evidence he has collected, and it is definitely not groundless or for other purposes. Now Deng suddenly falsely accuses him of being an extortion bandit, which is incomprehensible. If he is a bandit, why not accuse him to the authorities, but only after being accused himself does he publicly falsely accuse him of being a bandit? This is obviously a vengeful slander and should be held criminally responsible. (2) During the war, he and Qiang Lei remained in Shanghai to engage in anti-traitor work and sent a letter warning Deng Zhonghe to stop financing the enemy. Deng was willing to provide a small amount of money to assist the anti-Japanese troops. Standing on the anti-Japanese position, this is a patriotic act. Standing on the enemy's puppet position, one can arbitrarily add insulting terms to others. Deng's so-called first extortion refers to this. (3) The reason why he accuses Deng of being a traitor, in addition to the Wanlilang letter in the past, there is other strong evidence that is inconvenient to announce. Deng used military blankets, cotton yarn, and other important materials to finance the enemy, and also contacted the enemy military general's Deng's own Anle Factory site to provide it as a dormitory for employees of the Toyota Textile Co., Ltd. In addition, due to Deng's special relationship with the enemy military, Deng's factory was not subject to power supply restrictions. (4) He and Le Runtin went to the Englishman Glenn last winter to request the clarification of debts. At that time, Wanya was seized by Deng, and he and Deng mutually accused each other at the police station. There are records to check. If there was extortion, wouldn't the police take care of it? Deng's claim that he was extorted the second time was a deliberate slanderous injury in an attempt to vent his anger. He concluded by saying: Now that everything has been brought to justice, we should wait for a judicial resolution.

### Young Girl Aspirations for Journalism; Unable to Fulfill Her Wishes, She Commits Suicide by Poison

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Liyun, an 18-year-old local girl, at 16 Huanghe Road, Dongfuli, had been studying at a women's vocational school. She graduated this summer. Her father, Minggao, in order to enable his daughter to further her studies, intended to ask her to apply for the National Tongji University. However, Liyun aspired to journalism and asked a friend named Luo to introduce her to Shanghai New College. Soon, her parents found out and strongly opposed it, preventing her from enrolling and placing her under house arrest. However, Ms. Zhang's will was very strong, and despite several dissuasions, she never followed. At around 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, she had another argument with her mother over this issue and was slapped twice by her mother. Later, she was dissuaded by relatives and friends from going downstairs. Before long, the girl, feeling resentful at being beaten and humiliated, secretly swallowed poisonous potion and committed suicide. The incident was discovered afterwards and she was rushed to the hospital for treatment.

### Young Woman Attempts Suicide Due to Family Dispute

[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 6:50 p.m. yesterday, Zhang Wang, a 20-year-old young woman, No. 9, Lane 578, Nanchang Road, had a family dispute and suddenly had suicidal thoughts. She took poison and attempted suicide alone in the room. She was later discovered by her family and rushed to Qing Hospital for treatment.

### Special Relief Donation; Shipping Industry Donates 100 Billion

According to the Shanghai Shipping Association, the member companies of the association, in view of the special relief donation, have decided to donate 100 billion yuan. In addition to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company bearing 40 billion yuan, the remaining 60 billion yuan will be calculated according to the net tonnage of the ships of each member company and will be paid off before the end of August. The donation will be collected by the China General Chamber of Commerce, and each member company has been notified to handle it.

### Qingyuan Art Society Annual Meeting; Election of Directors and Supervisors

The Qingyuan Art Society held its annual meeting on the 17th, electing Zhen Qicai, Pan Gongzhan, Ling Wanqing, Wang Yangzhen, Bao Juxiang, Pan Yaoju, Tang Jifu, Shen Maishi, Zhang Rui, Bao Xiaodie, Gao Nianci, Xu Yanqiu, Pang Zuoyu, Li Huiqiu, Yang Qingqing, and 15 others as directors, and Sun Luqing, Shen Tianxin, Wu Dongmai, Tang Guanyu, Wu Zhongxiong, Shen Jinbo, Lu Peizhi, and seven others as supervisors.

### New Cotton to Be on the Market Soon; Spinning Mills Prepare to Purchase

The new cotton of this year will be on the market soon, and cotton farmers in various places are preparing to harvest. Previously, many spinning mills in this city were partially suspended due to the lack of raw cotton, and they have now sent personnel to prepare for the purchase work. The state-owned China Textile Construction Corporation is scheduled to convene the second business meeting of the heads of each unit at 3:00 p.m. today to discuss the plan for purchasing new cotton, because there are many conveniences for purchasing domestic cotton under the current situation: (1) With the abolition of the Cotton Management Committee, domestic cotton can be freely purchased, which is much more convenient than when it was controlled. (2) After the issuance of the new currency, the gold yuan note, it is more convenient to carry than the old legal tender.

### All-Day Heavy Rain; Temperature Drops Suddenly

In this city, after 6:35 a.m. yesterday, heavy rain poured down. From morning to dusk, the total rainfall in 11 hours was nearly 1.025 inches, and the temperature dropped suddenly, with the highest being only 80.6 degrees and the lowest being 76.3 degrees. It presented a cool autumn atmosphere. According to the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, due to the heat flow in the southwestern part of the Siberian anticyclone, it came into contact with the eastern, central, and northern parts of our country. In the afternoon, the cold and hot air currents condensed, causing heavy rain in this city all day. Due to the stagnation of the cold and hot air currents, it is difficult to predict when the weather in this city will improve.

### The Disaster Area North of the Yellow River: An Endless Expanse of Water, 40,000 People Suffering and Enduring Calamities

— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou

[Special Report from Xiuwu, 18th of this Month via Airmail] For ten years, the people of northern Henan have been suffocating in an atmosphere of gunpowder, yet they must endure further natural disasters. Not to mention distant events, recent calamities include the great droughts of 1942 and 1943, followed by locust plagues, last year’s floods, and a windstorm in March of this year that destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of wheat fields in the three counties of Yuanwu, Yangwu, and Yanjin. Before the damage from the windstorm could be fully accounted for, the Qin River and the Huai River overflowed in July, causing an unprecedented flood.

According to the Xinxiang Fourth Administrative District Commissioner's Office, the affected area covers 1,151,546 acres, spanning the nine counties of Xinxiang, Xiuwu, Huojia, Wuzhi, Hui, Ji, Hong, Jun, and Hua. It has destroyed 42,419 houses, caused 489 deaths and injuries, and left 400,260 people in dire need of relief.

On July 31, representatives from Xiuwu and Wuzhi counties waded through water to Xinxiang to appeal to various sectors for help. The representative from Wuzhi County told reporters that in addition to the Qin River flooding, Wuzhi County also suffered from floods caused by the Yellow River's backflow, submerging 200,000 acres of farmland and causing more than 3,000 deaths. Over 60,000 people are in need of aid.

The Flood Flows North

The cause of this flood can be traced back to last year's flood. In July of last year, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 troops under the communist Chen Geng attempted to seize Jiaozuo, successively capturing the four counties of Qinyang, Bo’ai, Xiuwu, and Meng. In August, our Xinxiang and Jiaozuo garrison troops launched a pincer attack, recovering Xiuwu and reopening the transportation between Jiaozuo and Xinxiang. The communists, unwilling to give up, breached the Qin River levee near Dafan Village in Wuzhi County, mimicking the historical breach of the Yellow River to cut off Jiaozuo's connection to the outside world.

The Qin River flows from Shanxi into Henan, passing through Qinyang and Jiyuan counties, bypassing Wuzhi County, and flowing into the Yellow River. With the levee breached, the raging flood flowed north into the Dan River, causing widespread disaster. Although the Qin River flood caused damage last year, the disaster was relatively minor because the rainfall in northern Henan was not heavy at the time, and most of the autumn harvest had already been collected. From last year to this year, some people considered ways to seal the breach, but the breach was under communist control. Without considering the size of the project, sealing the breach would require at least two regiments to be stationed there, otherwise, no one could guarantee that the communists would not breach it a second time.

On July 18, 19, and 20, northern Henan experienced days of continuous heavy rain, causing the Qin River's water level to rise sharply. Mountain torrents from the Taihang Mountains rushed down. The Dan River, the upper reach of the Wei River, was originally just a narrow channel. How could it accommodate so much additional water? As a result, it burst its banks on both the north and south sides, submerging fields, harming people and livestock, and sweeping away houses and furniture, spiraling out of control.

Regarding the Yellow River flooding, Commissioner Zhang Jingzhong of the Fourth District told reporters that during the Anti-Japanese War, when he was fighting guerrillas in northern Henan, the communists were still allies. They breached the northern levee of the Qin River in an attempt to drown the troops under his command stationed in western Wuzhi. Zhang ordered three gaps to be dug in the Yellow River levee to divert the water south. Wanling Village, where the Yellow River now backflows, is one of the three original gaps.

When the reporter arrived in Xinxiang, Yan Mengli, the director of the Xinxiang-Jiaozuo Transportation Section, pointed to the platform at the station and told me that the water level at its highest point was almost level with the platform.

The floodwaters have receded slightly, and Xinxiang is not the most severely affected area, so there is no obvious sign of flooding in the Xinxiang urban area. The reporter traveled to the outskirts of Beiguan, where the flow of the Dan River was turbulent, which locals said was a rare occurrence.

Due to transportation and geographical factors, this flood in northern Henan may not be receiving enough attention. The reporter decided to visit the affected area. Considering transportation and security issues, the reporter decided to focus on Xiuwu, the most severely affected area.

Railroad Ties Made into Rafts

On the 3rd, I accompanied Fan Chengfang, the Chief Secretary of Xiuwu County who came to Xinxiang to appeal for help, to Xiuwu. The distance from Xinxiang to Xiuwu is 100 Chinese miles. We took the New-Jiaozuo section's repair work train to the 31st-kilometer marker – Shiziying, leaving 38 Chinese miles to walk.

Leaving Xinxiang Station and crossing the Pinghan Railway, there was still some standing water on both sides of the railway. What used to be a loess plain is now dotted with ponds and clear water. After passing through Huojia County, the county town was surrounded by water. Continuing west for three or four Chinese miles, the railway became a narrow and long peninsula extending into the large body of water on either side.

Arriving at Shiziying, we began walking the rest of the way, walking along the railway embankment. After not even two Chinese miles, we came to a breach that local residents had dug to divert the northward-flowing water. The breach was not large, so I took off my trousers and socks, changed into cloth-soled shoes provided by the orderly, and waded across. The water reached my mid-thigh.

Scattered rails lay on the embankment, and watermarks could still be seen on the stones of the road surface. The embankment was five or six feet higher than the fields, so we could imagine how deep the water was at its highest level.

There were countless breaches in the embankment, and water flowed endlessly from south to north. We waded through the smaller breaches. Some of the larger breaches were bridged with two rails, and we walked across them tremulously with a sense of "walking on thin ice", turning our bodies sideways and not daring to look down. In some places where the water was too strong, enterprising disaster victims had built wooden rafts about ten feet square. Four strong men lifted the four corners, and people stood on them, walking in the water which could reach their mouths. One raft was made of ten railroad ties, with a blackboard placed on top. Anyone with sensibility would say: "This is education and construction amidst the confluence of natural and man-made disasters!"

The Officials Don't Light Lamps

In a place where it is usually difficult to see water, now there is an endless expanse of water. Half of the houses were submerged. Although the sorghum stalks were tall, they would not bear fruit after being soaked in water. A farmer was examining his crops in the water by the side of the road. I asked him across the water, "Is it still good, fellow villager?" "It's no good!" From his voice, I could understand his feelings. Looking north, the water seemed to extend all the way to the foot of the Taihang Mountains, which breathed out white clouds, sighing beside us.

At every small village along the way, there were vendors selling tea and watermelon. Many children (you could call them disaster children) were naked, snatching the watermelon rinds we had eaten. They would fight over a piece of rind. The road was full of unspeakable, shocking scenes. The setting sun accompanied us as we ran to Xiuwu.

The next day, there was a fierce wind and heavy rain, so I could not work. In the evening, Chief Secretary Fan and I chatted with County Magistrate Xu Wentao, who had just returned from supervising the battle at Daiwang Town, in the county government. The county government did not have money to light lamps, and the room was pitch black. Outside the window, the wind and rain were bleak, and the ancient locust tree in the courtyard rustled in the strong wind.

County Magistrate Xu told the reporter about a grain requisition account: For military grain, a total of 5,000 large packages, totaling one million catties, were to be requisitioned from July to September this year. For provincial public grain, 6,500 shi, totaling 973,000 catties, were to be requisitioned for the entire year. For the Special Commissioner's Office public grain, 5,000 shi, totaling 750,000 catties, were needed from June this year to January next year. The county government's own expenses and the local militia's food and salaries required 3,000 shi per month, totaling 450,000 catties. But how much grain could Xiuwu County produce? The entire county has only 1,000 qing of arable land. Assuming each acre produces three dou of grain, the total annual grain production is only 30,000 shi, which is only enough for Xiuwu County's own expenses. There is a folk song among Xiuwu farmers: "Three months in spring, three months in autumn, three months of vegetables, three months of forbearance." This means that the spring harvest can sustain them for three months, the autumn harvest can also sustain them for three months, they have to dig wild vegetables outside for three months, and they only have to endure hunger for the remaining three months. In normal times, Xiuwu's food supply is not self-sufficient. Last year, the Qin River flooded, and this year's wheat harvest was poor. If County Magistrate Xu had not led the self-defense militia to seize the unharvested grain, Xiuwu County would have had a very difficult time getting through the spring famine this year. As of now, Xiuwu still owes more than three million catties of military grain and public grain to the authorities, so Chief Secretary Fan once told me: "The people of Xiuwu do not hope that the authorities will provide disaster relief. They would be satisfied if they could be exempted from paying these many arrears of grain." During the following days that the reporter stayed in Xiuwu, he confirmed the extent of the county government's poverty. The county magistrate frowned with anxiety over the 10 million yuan in funding required by the Xiu-Huo-Bo-Wu Four-County Command. The militia company commander cried to the county magistrate because the soldiers had no food to eat. These were facts more serious than the flood.

On the 5th, the reporter, Inspector Wang of the Special Commissioner's Office, and Chief Secretary Fan took a small boat to the western disaster area of Xiuwu. We were traveling on a river more than ten zhang wide. When we asked people, they told us that this was originally a highway from Xiuwu to Bo'ai. A pole dipped into the water was six or seven feet deep. As our boat went past, countless willow branches brushed our faces. Unfortunately, willows have become a source of sorrow here. Otherwise, it would truly be "green brushing the faces of passersby."

The boat navigated the highway, navigated the fields, and reached Yangchang, a relatively large village.

Black Noodle and Melon Rind

As soon as we entered the village, the people knew that we had come to investigate the disaster, so they all knelt before us, tears streaming down their faces. An elderly man said to me, "Last year's flood prevented us from harvesting the autumn wheat, and this year's wheat was also bad. We just hoped that the autumn harvest would be available so that we could live a good life, but now the autumn harvest has been flooded again. What should we do?" As he spoke, tears streamed down his face, one by one.

I asked an old woman, "What do you eat?" She told me that they waded to other villages to get some black noodles and cooked them into soup. She added with tears in her eyes, "My eldest grandson ate melon rind outside and got sick. He is still sleeping at home." Before she could finish, a middle-aged woman next to her interjected, "My little girl drowned a few days ago when she went outside to pick wild vegetables." Before she could finish, she burst into sobs.

Amidst a chorus of sobs, several disaster victims said to us, "We have nothing to eat, but the troops still want grain from us. If we don't give it, they beat us. We just hope that the Qin River mouth can be blocked so that the water will recede and we can farm. We will give them any grain, but now we have nothing. How can we give it?" After we comforted them for a while and promised to negotiate on their behalf, they allowed us to take a tour of the village.

There were several tiled houses in the village, and the courtyards were still a foot deep in water. Watermarks remained six or seven feet high on the walls. Most of the mud houses had collapsed. The housewives were sorting out the scattered furniture. Several donkeys or oxen were pitifully thin, staring blankly at us.

When we left Yangchang, the disaster victims repeatedly urged us, "Commissioners, please say more to the central government!" Their voices, along with the sorghum stalks in the water blown by the wind, trembled in unison.

After returning to the city, the leading figures of Xiuwu were discussing how to get through the spring famine next year. Because the Qin River mouth is not blocked, it seems that the water will not recede. If the planting season is missed, there will be nothing to eat next spring. However, a certain agency in Xinxiang still holds a negative attitude towards blocking the mouth, believing that blocking the mouth and receding water will affect the defense of northern Henan. But how will the four million disaster victims trapped in the water in northern Henan survive?

The Arsonist from Jiangyin, Miao Gengsheng, and Others, Escorted for Interrogation

[Report from Jiangyin, 21st of this Month] Miao Gengsheng, the deputy chief of the Third Bao in Ligang, west of the county, colluded with bandit Miao Shunbao and others to set fire to the home of fellow villager Miao Qing on the 28th of last month. The Shengang District escorted the arsonists Miao Gengsheng and others to the county for interrogation. County Magistrate Xu personally went to Ligang to investigate and confirmed the facts, deciding to deal with them severely. Now, Wang Nanlin and 38 other representatives of the people of Ligang Town have jointly submitted a petition to the county government and the local court, accusing Xu Zhenqing, a senator from Ligang, of exploiting the people and setting fire to Miao Qing's wheat house, requesting that he be punished by law.

The Township Head of Suzhou, Sun Xuchu, Accused of Extorting Settlement Allowances

[Report from Suzhou, 20th of this Month] Sun Xuchu, the township head of Xiangshan Township in the Wu West District under the county, forcibly apportioned settlement allowances among the baos based on the amount of land cultivated during the first conscription period of this year, ranging from five dou to two shi. Most of it was embezzled by Sun, arousing public outrage among more than 500 households of farmers from Jiangyin in the township. They appointed Miao Xikun, Wu A’chu, Li Helin, and others to jointly accuse Sun Xuchu of obstructing military service to the Wu County Regiment Management District. On the 20th, after the Regiment Management District Military Law Office summoned Sun Xuchu, he was ordered to be detained pending investigation due to the seriousness of the crime.

### Social Aspects of Shenyang

— Zhao Zhan, Our Correspondent

[Report from Shenyang via Airmail, 19th of this Month] The only transportation to and from Shenyang is by air, which contributes to a near economic suffocation that increases Shenyang’s instability. The social problems and conflicts increase daily, as do the number of criminals. One can easily see the famine by observing the long lines at a dozen or so soup kitchens, where poor people line up for hours for a single meal, and seeing beggars starving to death on the most luxurious Taiyuan Street. One need only open the newspaper to a full page of criminal news to find the answer: aberrant behavior is born from hunger, a life-or-death state of desperation that results in sadness, resentment, a desire to commit crime, a passive and declining lifestyle, and suicide. These are the foundations of criminal behavior.

Thefts and Rape Cases Happen One after Another

The most common case is robbery. The popularity of theft is the most serious problem in Shenyang today. The main culprit in the sensational 1.3 billion yuan robbery was an active military police officer, who has been executed. There are a variety of robbery tactics, and many robbers impersonate military officials to rob. Many small thieves are killed at night. Large and small thefts are increasing daily. The public security bureau feels there isn’t enough space in the overcrowded jails to hold the prisoners. The burden of food for the prisoners is also a problem.

As prices soar, rape cases also increase. Here is an example: A 12-year-old girl was raped by a 32-year-old scoundrel. The girl, Wang Yuru, had a mother whose aunt was living with an army captain named Lu Gan. They broke up and Lu Gan came to the house seeking intimacy with his former lover but was rejected. Lu Gan saw the girl was young and pretty and lust overcame him. He forced himself on the girl, who was injured and passed out. Before this event, a bao instructor in Yuhong district raped a 14-year-old girl while pretending to check household registrations. Before that, Wang Fu raped Wang Jialin, a student at the Fourth Middle School, and was executed.

Death is a Blessing, Dying Young Saves One from Suffering, Dry in the Sun Saves on Coffin Costs

Suicide is no longer a stimulating news item in Shenyang. Although there are no detailed statistics, the number of suicides has increased recently. Some entire families commit suicide by poison. Some jump into the Hun River. Still others hang themselves in scenic Beiling Park. In Shenyang, you can see corpses rotting on the streets as you walk around. Most die of starvation. People move the body around to avoid the stench of the rotting corpse. Local officials do not collect the corpses, so no one cares. Passersby only cover their noses and walk past. A reporter passed the corpse of a dead beggar outside the Yingzhou Restaurant in the Beishi district. He was standing next to a living beggar who lamented, “Death is a blessing, dying young saves one from suffering, and drying in the sun saves on coffin costs.”

Students are Prostitutes on the Streets

Anyone who has been to Shenyang knows that the romantic Chunri Town (now Taiyuan Street) was, at the beginning of the recovery, a place where Japanese women sold trash and showed off their allure. Now, the scene is the same, but the faces are different. We are seeing our fellow sisters take the place of Japanese women who have already returned to a steadily growing Japan. Hunger is driving unemployed women to sell their bodies. When the lights come on at night, they appear on the streets like ghosts. It is estimated that there are over 10,000 women in this “profession.” They are most active on Taiyuan Street, where bars and cafes are concentrated, similar to the Ginza district of Tokyo. The Shenyang nightlife is concentrated on this short road. Some hotels have become flesh markets, with prices not as high as the pork market. It is said that some of the prostitutes are female students. These miserable goddesses understand very well that their souls will not rise to heaven, but will rot with their bodies.

### Guanwai Travelogue (7): The Yanching Oil Mine - Welfare Undertakings Investigation

— Our Reporter Song Lin

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Dispatch, 18th by Air] The oil industry itself has only two types of projects, namely oil extraction and refining. Consequently, it only has two departments: the well site and the refinery. At the Ganqing Oil Mine in Laojunmiao, Yumen, Gansu, the well site section, including its affiliated engineering office, "Drilling Department, Drilling Teams 1 and 2, Extraction Department, and Repair Department, has only slightly more than 500 employees. The refinery section, including the Refining Department, Mechanical and Electrical Department, Engineering Management Office, Oil Products Depot, Wax Factory, Administrative Affairs Section, and Laboratory, has only slightly more than 700 employees. Therefore, those directly engaged in production number only slightly more than 1,200 people. However, the total number of employees at the Ganqing Oil Mine is actually slightly more than 5,300. Among these more than 4,000 people, apart from a very small proportion of management personnel, the majority are engaged in employee welfare undertakings to ensure the smooth progress of oil production projects.

Isolated from the World, Welfare Foremost

The persons in charge of the Ganqing Oil Mine attach the same importance to employee welfare undertakings as they do to engineering affairs. This is because on this boundless Gobi Desert at the foot of the Qilian Mountains, although the oil river flows northward incessantly throughout the year, its banks do not even have a single clump of low shrubs. Even if you had countless gold, you could not buy a pound of sesame cake. This is a place isolated from the world. The daily necessities of the mine's nine thousand employees and their families all depend on external sources. Take grain, for example: it must be purchased and transported from more than 300 kilometers away. Even the daily vegetables must be obtained from Jiuquan, which is more than 100 kilometers away. These supplies cannot be short even for a single day. Therefore, the promotion of welfare undertakings has become a necessary and urgent measure for the mine.

The Ganqing Oil Mine has been engaged in welfare undertakings for ten years. They are constantly seeking ways to improve, but due to various constraints, they have not yet achieved their ideal state. However, they are currently able to provide a complete supply of essential food and clothing for employees and their families.

When the reporter visited the mine, he spoke with Wu Songlin, the head of the General Affairs Section, and Wang Changgeng, the head of the Welfare Section, about this arduous and difficult work. Director Wu said, "Our ideal for employee welfare is not only to improve their livelihoods, protect their interests, meet their needs, and reduce their living burden, but also to enrich their spiritual lives, increase their work interest, and provide them with opportunities for extracurricular study and leisure activities to promote their physical and mental well-being. In addition, we also seek to ensure employee safety, alleviate their life threats, provide protection against illness and disaster, and offer relief." "Yes, this work is too important!" Director Wang added, "Whether it is done well or not not only directly affects the lives of nearly ten thousand employees and their families, but also has a great impact on the development of the mine's operations."

The source of daily supplies for these many people relies on the offices of the Welfare Section stationed in Zhangye, Wuwei, Jiuquan, and Yumen, which need to purchase and transport them at any time. The main items are food, meat, dried vegetables, fresh vegetables, eggs, and seasonings. As for clothing, socks, toothpaste, towels, and other daily necessities, they are purchased and transported by the section's Lanzhou office or entrusted to various business offices and the Shanghai head office. According to current needs, 45,000 shi of food, 1,000 tons of daily necessities, and 2,000 tons of vegetables must be purchased each year. Most of these items are transported by vehicles from the Lanzhou business office.

Lowering Prices, Implementing Rationing

More than two-thirds of the mine's employees are from the Northwest. The staple food of the people in the Northwest is flour. Therefore, after purchasing wheat, the mine has a water mill with six grinding stones in Jiayuguan and a machine flour mill in Laojunmiao to grind its own flour. Each month, it can grind a total of 300,000 jin of flour, which is enough for the needs of all the people in the mine. Currently, each employee is rationed 5 shi sheng of rice, 21 to 44 jin of flour per month (smaller portions for small households), as well as 2 jin of vegetable oil, 1 jin of salt, and about 4 jin of soy sauce and vinegar. The prices of these items are not only very cheap, but also kept as low as possible for the workers. The price list for July (unit: yuan) is as follows:

Table of Quantities of Daily Necessities Rationed to Employees and Families This Year

In Lanzhou, one dou of rice currently sells for 7.7 million yuan, and one jin of flour sells for 3.3 million yuan. Therefore, the employees of the mine live very stable lives and are mostly dedicated to their duties and willing to take on responsibilities. Compared to the labor disputes that often occur in factories in other large cities, this is truly another world.

More than a dozen other daily welfare items, such as clothing and footwear, are allocated in fixed quantities and supplied at a uniform price. As for cigarettes, sweets, and other daily consumables, they can be purchased at will at Jiuquan market prices without restrictions.

The July selling prices of these items were 500,000 yuan per chi of woolen cloth, 80,000 yuan per bar of soap, 100,000 yuan per toothbrush, and 90,000 yuan per chi of blue city cloth.

Various Institutions Arise in Response

On the reporter's tour, there were many production, health, and other institutions affiliated with the supply cooperative, all established to meet the needs of employee life. They are recorded separately as follows:

(A) Production Institutions:

(1) Sewing Department: Produces an average of 1,000 sets of Chinese and Western-style clothing and 2,000 pieces of various miscellaneous items per month. (2) Shoemaking Department: Produces an average of 100 pairs of leather shoes and 500 pairs of cloth shoes per month. (3) Sauce-Making Department: Produces soy sauce, fermented soybean paste, chili sauce, pickles, etc., as needed. (4) Brewing Department: Produces vinegar for seasoning, also brewed as needed. (5) Pastry Department: Bakes various pastries, averaging 300 jin per month. (6) Tofu Department: Produces tofu and dried tofu to supplement the lack of vegetables, averaging 200,000 squares per month.

(B) Health Facilities:

(1) Bathhouse: Equipped with 24 showers, used in shifts, with an attached delousing room for steam delousing. (2) Barber Shop: Three shops, 20 craftsmen. (3) Laundry Department: 50 workers, providing laundry services at very low prices. (4) Chinese Medicine Department: Sells Chinese medicine and prepared medicines.

(D) Other Facilities:

(1) Cafeteria: Provides economical set meals, simple banquets, and sporadic snacks. (2) Photography Department: Takes and develops photos. (3) Repair Department: Repairs broken shoes and welds various utensils.

Another department in the office always stocks fresh vegetables, dried vegetables, seasonings, half sheep, pork, etc., which can be purchased at will at Jiuquan market prices. However, during festivals, these items are also distributed in fixed quantities. In terms of food, the Ganqing Oil Mine has been seeking self-sufficiency in recent years. Therefore, it has affiliated farms in Jiayuguan, Chijinbao, and Jiuquan, with more than 600 mu of self-owned land and more than 100 mu of rented land. Each year, it can produce more than 3 million jin of various vegetables and a small amount of grains and miscellaneous grains. It also raises a small number of cattle, sheep, pigs, and poultry to supply meat and milk.

Regarding the many low-priced welfare goods supplied as reported above, how much benefit can each person enjoy? According to Director Wang's statistics, each single employee enjoys a total value of more than 3.8 million yuan in benefits from the difference between the rationed price and the market price. The total value for single laborers is 9.6 million yuan. If they have families, the total value per household is more than 30 million yuan.

Water, Electricity, and Fuel Enjoyed Free of Charge

Employees with families can also enjoy water, electricity, fuel (residual oil or gas), furniture, and utensils free of charge. The first three are delivered to their homes on time. In addition to a Chinese medicine clinic with two Chinese medicine practitioners to treat employees, the mine also has a relatively small hospital. In terms of medical equipment and technology, it has recently established cooperation with Lanzhou Central Hospital, with internal medicine, surgery, dentistry, and midwifery departments, as well as a laboratory and 35 beds. It still lacks X-ray equipment. Two midwives, nine nurses, and ten doctors are busy all day long, with an average of 9,000 consultations per month. Medical treatment and surgery are free of charge. In the past, there were excellent surgeons here, but most have now left. The most common diagnoses in the mining area are colds and dysentery. Other infectious diseases are rare. There are at least 20 appendectomies performed each month.

### General Commodity Prices: Market Trends Mostly Rise First, Then Fall Back

The currency reform, which has been the central issue of economic problems since the late period of the War of Resistance against Japan and the three years after victory, was finally implemented last Friday. This issue has undergone long-term deliberations by government authorities and numerous discussions by scholars and experts. It is undoubtedly a major measure since the implementation of the legal tender in the 24th year of the Republic (1935) . Its impact on the entire economy in the future is self-evident. I will first mention it here, and this publication will have a special article on it later.

Last week's prices, following the momentum of the previous weekend, mostly hovered at high peaks. In the market, due to rampant rumors, both bulls and bears adopted a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the announcement of the new plan. By Thursday, on the eve of the currency reform, the rumors became increasingly confirmed, and general prices mostly showed a slight downward trend. From Friday onwards, the new currency system was announced, and the Shanghai and Tianjin stock exchanges were ordered to suspend business. They cannot resume operations without the approval of the Executive Yuan. The financial industry in this city temporarily closed for two days. At the same time, the markets for rice, flour, coal, cotton cloth, silk, miscellaneous grains, edible oil, bean cake, cigarettes, daily necessities, imported goods, timber, foreign paper, and medicinal materials also closed for two days, resuming on Monday this week. Last week's wholesale price index was 8,318,612 times, up 24.94% from the previous week.

Last week's exchange situation of the national banks showed continuous and huge deficits, which was unprecedented. It is estimated that the deficit was more than 410 billion on Monday, more than 340 billion on Wednesday, and more than 250 billion on Thursday. According to analysis, this was due to: (1) repayment of principal and interest on maturing treasury bills, (2) payment of military and government funds, and expenses for purchasing grain and flour, (3) purchase of exchange settlement certificates. In retrospect, this purchase measure was undoubtedly related to the planned currency reform. The unofficial interest rate was around 6 jiao.

Last week, the selling price of exchange settlement certificates gradually increased, from 7.4 million at the beginning of the week to 7.8 million on Thursday. The buying price of gold ornaments at the beginning of the week was 540 million per tael, and the selling price was 580 million per tael, an increase of 20 million the next day, with no change on Wednesday and Thursday. Due to the small unit of silver dollars, which facilitated transactions, both supply and demand were high, and the price rose sharply, from a selling price of 6.8 million at the beginning of the week to 7.8 million on Thursday.

The trend of the commodity market was roughly the same as before. In terms of cotton cloth, 42-count Blue Phoenix was 2.9 billion at the beginning of the week, 3.25 billion on Tuesday, and then back to 3.11 billion on Thursday; 21-count Double Horse was 2.15 billion at the beginning of the week, 2.47 billion on Tuesday, and then back to 3.11 billion on Thursday. Dragon Head fine cloth fell from a peak of 90 million to 88.5 million on Thursday.

Grain prices remained stable. At the beginning of the week, top-grade japonica rice was at 60 million, hovering between 62.3 million from Tuesday to Thursday. Crude oil hovered at 189 million, and Battleship No. 1 flour hovered at 21.2 million. Other items such as daily necessities, chemicals, metals, and building materials also mostly followed this trend, rising first and then falling back.

Last week's wholesale price index classified by use is as follows:

Last week's wholesale price index classified by processing degree is as follows:

Last week's wholesale price index classified by country of production and sales is as follows:

### On the New Currency System

The currency reform, which has been in the works for several years, was finally announced and implemented on August 20. This is a major measure in our country's monetary history since the implementation of the legal tender in the 24th year of the Republic (1935). The birth of this new currency system is based on the provisions of the Temporary Provisions During the Period of Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion and was promulgated by the President with an emergency financial and economic decree. Therefore, our view of the gold yuan is very heavy in our hearts.

The standard currency of the new currency system is the gold yuan, with a statutory gold content of 0.22217 grams of pure gold per yuan. However, there is no gold currency circulating on the market, and the gold yuan cannot be freely purchased for foreign exchange. Therefore, the new currency system is a kind of virtual gold standard system, or a managed gold standard system.

Article 10 of the Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations stipulates that the inspection and safekeeping of the gold yuan issuance reserve shall be handled by the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee. Article 13 stipulates that the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee shall, after the end of each month, inspect the amount of gold yuan issued by the Central Bank and the issuance reserve situation, and make an inspection report for public announcement. This spirit of open and independent issuance is roughly similar to the initial implementation of the legal tender. We hope that the government should strictly adhere to it to the end.

Article 8 of the Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations stipulates that the issuance of the gold yuan shall adopt a 100% reserve system. Among the aforementioned issuance reserves, 40% must be gold, silver, and foreign exchange, and the remainder shall be filled with valuable securities and assets of state-owned enterprises designated by the government. This is slightly different from the initial regulations for the issuance of the legal tender, which stipulated that the cash reserve was 60% and the guarantee reserve was 40%.

We look forward to the key to the success or failure of the gold yuan in the future. Although there are many arguments, there is only one key point: whether prices can be stable. If prices are stable, the gold yuan can be said to be a complete success; if prices rise, then the economic crisis in the future is unimaginable. Therefore, in addition to announcing the Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations, the government also announced the Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People, the Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by the People of the Republic of China, and the Measures for Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Control. On the one hand, it strives to concentrate foreign exchange funds and balance government revenue and expenditure; on the other hand, it makes the greatest determination to stabilize future prices.

Article 9 of the Issuance Regulations stipulates that the total issuance of gold yuan shall be limited to 2 billion yuan. According to the calculation that one gold yuan is equal to 3 million legal tender, 2 billion gold yuan should be equal to 6 trillion legal tender. According to general estimates, the current amount of legal tender issued is about 7-8 trillion, and its actual value is only more than 10% of 2 billion gold yuan. Therefore, although the issuance of gold yuan is limited to 2 billion, it must never be issued to the full amount in a short period of time, because society does not need such a large amount of currency at one time, and at the same time, material resources cannot be increased many times in a short period of time. If the amount of gold yuan issued exceeds the actual value multiple of the current legal tender issuance too much, prices will still rise.

Article 2 of the Measures for Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Control stipulates that various tax revenues should be effectively increased, and tax rates that are lower than pre-war standards should be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards. Article 3 stipulates that fees for state-owned public utility and transportation undertakings that are lower than pre-war standards shall be allowed to be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards in order to achieve self-sufficiency. This kind of regulation seems to be beyond reproach from the government's standpoint, but it is too far-fetched from the perspective of overall prices. Because if donations and taxes increase, merchants are unwilling to bear them and do not have the ability to bear them. As a result, they will naturally be passed on to consumers, and prices will still rise. Increasing fees for state-owned public utility and transportation undertakings will also increase the production costs of industry and commerce, leading to price increases. Therefore, the government should give more technical consideration when implementing this regulation.

We review the loss of credit of the legal tender. Although the reasons are very diverse, the only thing that is expressed is that prices rise, and the eve of each price surge is always due to the disaster of the flooding of speculative capital. From the perspective of the new plan, it stipulates that the people shall not hold gold, silver, and foreign currency. If the people really follow the government's regulations to exchange them for gold yuan, then the speculative capital on the market may be even more than in the past. How to effectively divert speculative capital and stabilize prices invisibly is a very serious problem. Although public bonds are not a bad way, the effect in the past was not significant. This problem still needs to be carefully considered by the authorities.

In this time's Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency, it is stipulated that one silver dollar can be exchanged for two gold yuan, one US dollar can be exchanged for four gold yuan, and one tael of gold can be exchanged for 200 gold yuan. However, on the eve of the announcement of the new plan, the black market price of silver dollars was about 2.5 yuan, the black market price of US dollars was about 4 yuan, and the black market price of gold was slightly less than 200 yuan. Judging from the stipulated exchange rate, those who hold silver dollars will suffer a loss, and those who hold gold dollars will get a bargain. It can also be further said that the new plan is somewhat biased towards the interests of wealthy people. Therefore, we hope that the Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets can be implemented quickly and faithfully, so that wealthy people can contribute more to the war to suppress the rebellion.

In general, the new plan also has some shortcomings, but it is barely satisfactory. The problem is whether it can be implemented fairly and faithfully to the end, especially when encountering strong resistance or when there is no force, it should be overcome impartially.

### Currency and Finance (1) Unofficial Interest Rates

This city's money market last week, although on Monday, the salary payment period of the month for the value banks made the demand for funds very high, and it was slightly tight, but subsequently, due to the huge expenditure of the national treasury and the arrival of remittances from other ports, it turned to be loose.

Commercial banks resumed interbank lending, and there were ample orders. Interbank positions were slightly more popular due to the eagerness of those who needed orders. Although cash chips were slightly relieved due to the introduction of 250,000 Customs Gold Unit notes, the discount on large notes was still around 5-6% due to the large number of speculators.

Last week on Thursday, the authorities promulgated the Emergency Financial and Economic Decree, announcing four measures including the issuance of the gold yuan. From that day on, it was stipulated that the gold yuan would be the currency unit, with denominations of one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. It also has metal subsidiary coins. 3 million legal tender can be exchanged for one gold yuan. The statutory exchange period is three months. A total of 2 billion new currency will be issued, adopting a 100% reserve system. 40% of it will be gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves. The so-called currency reform that had been brewing for a long time has finally been realized. In addition, silver and money businesses were ordered to close for two days from Friday to cooperate with this emergency measure. Therefore, the market conditions of the financial industry last week lasted only four days from Monday to Thursday.

Last week's unofficial interest rate generally hovered around 6 jiao. The interest rate for cotton cloth was about 30 yuan for daily lending, and the interest rate for department stores was about 25 yuan for daily lending. The interest rate for securities companies was mostly 29 yuan for buyers and 26 yuan for sellers.

The results of the national bank and bureau treasury exchange showed a total deficit of 946.68 billion from Monday to Thursday. However, the national banks had huge amounts of treasury bill principal and interest to pay on Monday, which were paid by means of account transfers. Therefore, the actual deficit should be more than 1 trillion, and the easing of the money market was greatly affected by it.

From Monday to Thursday, foreign banks had a total surplus of 777.09 billion. In addition to a portion of the proceeds from the sale of exchange settlement certificates, it is said that most of it was capital flight.

The results of the exchange of banks and businesses after the 60th day of last week showed a total deficit of 824.4 billion. The indirect exchange group between commercial banks still had a surplus of more than 1 trillion. The shift to easing in the money market can also be seen in general.

(2) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

When the Chinese stock market opened at the beginning of the week, it was fatigued due to the strong rumors of negative news and the active selling by speculative groups, foreign stock groups, and banking groups. In the afternoon, it was heard that the money market was easing, and the situation improved, but most stocks still had difficulty exceeding the closing price of the previous weekend. Yongsha closed at 15,700 yuan, a slight drop from the previous weekend. Rongfeng, Shanghai Cement, and Commercial Press all rose, Xinyi rose to the limit, and the rest fell slightly.

The next day, due to the huge deficit of the national bank and bureau the day before, and the fact that commodity prices outside the circle were rising one after another, the stock market suddenly rose sharply. As a result, all stocks rose uniformly, and 11 stocks including Yongsha, Yongye, Huaci, Jinglun, Dongxing, Rongfeng, Hengfeng, Yonggong, Commercial Press, Zhongxing, and Zhongyi jumped to the limit.

On Wednesday, the reduction in prices of public utilities was realized, and rumors of currency reform were rampant again. Guangbang sold off at high prices, and the market fell slightly. Yongsha closed at 16,980 yuan. Among other stocks, Yongye and Shanghai Cement rose to the limit, Tongyi, Qinxing, Zhonghuo, Zhongni, and Yonggong rose, and the rest fell.

On Thursday, due to rumors that new measures such as the new economic reform plan and currency reform were about to be announced, people were panicked, large investors sold off at high prices, and floating investors cut their losses one after another. The market sentiment was exhausted, and the falling trend was tragic. As a result, except for Huaxin and Shanghai Cement, which rose to the limit, the rest all fell. Among them, Yongsha, Xinnuo, Meiya, Zhabei, and Qinxing all fell to the limit.

### Possible Consequences of the New Economic Program and Currency Reform

The long-brewing new economic program and currency reform have finally emerged, breaking through various rumors and repeated denials. This cannot be regarded as anything other than a major event in the financial world, and it must be recognized as another historical attempt by the government to improve the current economic situation. From the government's standpoint, such an attempt will naturally have some significant gains. However, whether it will benefit the general public and the business community, in addition to various theoretical inferences, still needs to be proven by facts.

It is worth examining the possible gains that the new economic reform program and currency reform may bring to the government. For ease of analysis, this can be explained in several points:

(1) Centralization of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange Reserves: According to the published reserve ratio for the Gold Yuan notes, of which 40% is calculated as gold, silver, and foreign exchange, the current gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves in the national treasury are approximately US$200 million. This is close to the estimate of US$150 million in reserves recently published by the Far Eastern Economic Review magazine in Hong Kong. Now that the conversion rate of the Gold Yuan has completely acknowledged the black market prices of gold and foreign exchange (stipulating that one US dollar can be exchanged for 12 million Gold Yuan), and the law strictly prohibits the circulation and holding of gold, silver, and foreign currencies after September 30, it is expected that some cautious small savers of gold, silver, and foreign currencies will release some or all of their savings to deposit or exchange with the Central Bank. In addition, some speculators in gold notes may also shift their funds to other uses due to risk considerations. As for funds or foreign exchange reserves used for fleeing the country, unless the overall domestic situation changes, a mere decree may still be difficult to change their direction of movement. Furthermore, under the favorable conditions of implicitly acknowledging black market prices, income from overseas remittances and export settlements may also increase. In short, the new program may contribute to the centralization of scattered gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves in the country, but the extent to which they can be centralized mainly depends on the government's credibility with the people, because nationalizing gold and silver is different from nationalizing land; the former is easier to hide and transport.

The new control measures can also be said to spare no effort in saving various foreign exchange expenditures. For example, "The fees for state-owned public utilities and transportation enterprises shall be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards in order to achieve self-sufficiency." For example, "Import quotas, starting from the seventh quarter, shall be reduced by at least one-quarter based on the average standards of the fifth and sixth quarters." Furthermore, in cities such as Shanghai, "Within two months after the promulgation of the measures, the number of various vehicle licenses shall be reduced by one-quarter to one-third, and the amount of fuel used by vehicles shall be strictly limited." This shows how tightly the authorities are controlling the use of foreign exchange. In all fairness, this is because part of the government's foreign exchange has been used for the suppression of the rebellion.

As for dealing with assets held abroad, it is obviously more complicated. Firstly, the so-called "Except for overseas Chinese, all foreign exchange assets held abroad as of August 20, 1948... shall be declared and registered," but the term "overseas Chinese" is not clearly defined. Secondly, it will be impossible to investigate some wealthy families who hold their assets in the names of foreigners. Thirdly, unless the laws of the countries where the assets are located are changed, it will be impossible for the government to "negotiate with the foreign governments concerned for confiscation." It can be seen that the so-called "Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Held Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China" may still be quite far from actual implementation.

(2) Regarding Balancing the Budget and Managing Prices: Most economists believe that the success or failure of currency reform depends on whether the budget can be balanced. The new program stipulates that the method of balancing the budget, in addition to the so-called saving of expenses and selling surplus materials that have been talked about for a long time, seems to focus on actually "increasing various tax revenues." It also stipulates that "Tax rates lower than pre-war standards shall be adjusted with reference to previous standards." Whether the business community can bear the increased tax rates compared to pre-war levels is certainly a question. However, the price increases caused by the increase in tax rates are at least highly likely. This is the first point. Furthermore, the fees for state-owned public utilities are also adjusted "with reference to pre-war standards in order to achieve self-sufficiency," and the stimulation of prices is also difficult to be optimistic about. This is the second point. The reduction in import quotas can cause imported goods to rise in price. This is the third point. The approximation of export settlements to the black market is certainly a stimulus to export materials. This is the fourth point. Various factors related to the overall economic situation are closely related to each other. If there is still a large loophole in the budget that cannot be filled, then moving east to make up for the west will involve each other, and prices will still have to rise. Some of the expected results of the currency reform may also disappear one by one. The authorities are also aware of this, so in the new program, they reiterate the strengthening of controls to stabilize the foundation of the new currency.

(3) Using Political Laws and Decrees to Strengthen Economic Control: In addition to the aforementioned general increase in tax revenue, the government has also decided that it "shall not make loans of a commercial nature in any way." At the same time, "The minimum capital amount of banks, money shops, and trust companies in each district shall be formulated with reference to the pre-war Banking Law, and the minimum capital amount shall be increased to the minimum capital amount within two months, and the cash capital increase shall not be less than 50%." Otherwise, "All shall be ordered to suspend business and liquidate within a time limit." The crackdown on the banking industry can be said to be not small. Not only that, but the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Tianjin have been ordered to suspend business temporarily, and later "Newspapers, dispatches, and other printed materials shall not record the black market prices of gold, silver, foreign exchange, and various important daily necessities." Control can be said to have reached the extreme. As for the so-called cost of living index that ordinary people care about, it has also become a historical relic. Originally, under the disguised policy of "freezing" the cost of living index, unless prices remain stable for a long time, it will inevitably cause conflict and confrontation between labor and management. Therefore, the new measures further "prohibit the blockade of factories, strikes, and slowdowns. Violators shall be punished in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 4 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing the National Mobilization Law." The laws and decrees on whether or not the so-called prices of various goods and services can be raised still have a flexible phrase, "Those with special reasons shall not be allowed to increase prices without the approval of the competent authorities." Therefore, labor-management disputes may still be unavoidable in the future under the new laws and decrees. This is indeed something that the authorities need to carefully consider and implement cautiously.

It is certainly too early to make a judgment on the new program promulgated by the authorities and predict its success or failure. However, theoretical speculation is not only not superfluous, but also necessary, because we feel that the current economic crisis is serious, and the new currency system can only succeed and not fail. We have high expectations and strict supervision. We hope that the authorities will be deeply vigilant and implement this new measure fairly and practically.

### The Future of Education in Northeast China is Worrying - Private Middle Schools in Shenyang are Difficult to Maintain - Teacher Training Schools are Crowded with Applicants

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] There are a total of fourteen private junior and senior middle schools in Shenyang.

### National Yingshi University

— This Newspaper Jinhua Correspondent Jiang Feng

Born in the flames of war, grew up on the battlefield, and seeks progress in stability!

[This Newspaper, Jinhua Correspondence] Yingshi University is the youngest little brother among the national universities in the country. The motive for establishing Yingshi University was in 1938. At that time, universities in Southeast China were threatened by the enemy and moved inland one after another. High school graduates were restricted by transportation and could not go to inland areas to study. The Zhejiang provincial authorities, in view of this, intended to establish a university to accommodate young people who could not go to the rear to study. After the 1025th meeting of the provincial government was passed, Xu Shaodi, Gu Zhenggang, Ruan Jingcheng, Huang Zubei, Ren Yanxiang, Zhao Zengjue, Wang Jie, Huang Zhuming, etc. were appointed as members of the preparatory committee to be responsible for the preparations. The preparations were completed in October 1939. At that time, the war on the eastern battlefield was extremely fierce, and Yingshi University was born in the flames of war. The Zhejiang provincial government originally planned to name it Zhejiang Provincial Wartime University in order to train talents needed during the war to meet the needs of resisting the war and building the country. Later, the Ministry of Education believed that the university must be permanent, and President Chiang had long intended to establish a university to commemorate the martyr Chen Yingshi. Mr. Yingshi happened to be from Zhejiang, so it was officially named Yingshi University.

In the early spring of 1943, Chen Lifu took over the Ministry of Education and believed that the school needed to be adjusted and expanded, so he decided to change Yingshi University into a national university. On the one hand, the Department of Law and the Department of Art of the Southeast Associated University were transferred to Yingshi University, and on the other hand, the Department of Engineering was separated to independently establish the National Beiyang Institute of Technology. It also handled the administrative, financial, and accounting special courses on behalf of Zhejiang Province. At that time, there were three departments of agriculture, medicine, and law, and five special courses of art, cooperation, administration, finance, and accounting. In the summer of 1944, Zhu Jiahua took over the Ministry of Education and reorganized higher education. The medical department of Yingshi University was merged with the Zhejiang Provincial Medical College (the reason was that the academic system was different. Yingshi University has recently been approved to continue to establish a medical department, and it can be restored as soon as the school building problem is solved.) The Beiyang Institute of Technology was again transferred to Yingshi University to establish a Department of Engineering. The special courses of cooperation and art were discontinued. In the autumn of 1946, President He Gu was approved to add a Department of Literature and Science. The special courses of administration, finance, and accounting were ended one after another and no longer continued to enroll students.

Now, except for the medical department, which is still to be gradually restored, Yingshi University has four departments and seventeen departments. The Department of Literature and Science has departments of Chinese Literature, History, Physics, and Mathematics; there are also departments of Philosophy, Chemistry, and Foreign Languages that have not yet enrolled students. The Department of Law has departments of Economics, Political Science, and Law (divided into three groups: Administrative Law, Theoretical Law, and Judicial Law.) The Department of Agriculture has departments of Agronomy, Agricultural Economics, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry. The Department of Engineering has departments of Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.

All former presidents believed that the most important thing in personnel matters was professors; if the professors are good, the school will be good, "With professors, there is a school." However, because it is located in the interior of Zhejiang Province and transportation is not as convenient as Beijing and Shanghai, it is more difficult to hire celebrities. However, in recent years, all former presidents have worked hard to hire professors. The current president is Tang Jihe. The Dean of Academic Affairs is Cai Binmou, the Dean of Student Affairs is Zhao Xixian, and the Dean of General Affairs is Yan Juhua. There are also many well-known figures in the faculty, such as Wen Shi, Cha Mengji, Zhang Zongyuan, Jiang Liangtian, and Yang Deyun in the Department of Literature and Science; Zhu Zuhui, Mei Zhongxie, Zhao Wenbing, and Liu Zhifan in the Department of Law; Fan Yunqian, Fang Ti, Xu Dou, and Wang Binhai in the Department of Agriculture; and Wang Guisun, Wang Ziyu, Wang Zuwu, and Jiang Chao in the Department of Engineering.

There are currently nearly 1,000 students in the school. Because it is limited to the fact that there is no permanent school building, it cannot enroll as many students as possible. There are about 160 graduates this year.

Yingshi University after the restoration has been slightly turbulent, and the most difficult thing is the problem of school buildings. After moving to Jinhua, except for the Department of Literature and Science, which has a temporary school building, the other departments, schools, and the general office are all rented and repaired for use, and most of them are temporary. President Tang has tried his best to raise funds for the construction of school buildings, but because the cost is too high, the current financial resources of the Ministry of Education cannot bear it, so he has to proceed gradually. It has now been decided to build Yingshi Memorial Hall and Yingshi Library at Gaocun, about eight miles from the city at the foot of Beishan in Jinhua, and a committee has been established to be responsible for the project. Other school buildings are planned to be built with funds allocated by the Ministry of Education in order to gradually realize the plan. This is also President Tang Jihe's approach of "seeking progress steadily from stability." Yingshi University is obviously gradually moving towards the light.

### The Second Municipal Student Swimming Competition: Over One Hundred Male and Female Students Participate; Held at the Hongkou Pool the Day After Tomorrow

The Second Shanghai Municipal Student Swimming Championship, sponsored by the Municipal Sports Field, will be held as scheduled at the Hongkou Swimming Pool on the 25th of this month (Wednesday), regardless of weather changes. The competition will begin at 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM, concluding in one day. Ms. Li Ximou, daughter of Director Li, will present the awards. Registration closed at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. A total of 88 male students from universities and middle schools, 7 female students from universities and middle schools, and 19 students from elementary schools have registered, totaling 114 participants, which can be described as unprecedentedly enthusiastic. These emerging talents are the new blood of the swimming community. In particular, the breaststroke of Sun Guangyi and Sun Guanger from Gezhi Middle School, the freestyle of Liang Wenzhi from Fuxing Middle School, the backstroke of Chen Yuntai from Gezhi, the freestyle of Jiang Weiliang and Wei Jihua from St. John's University, the freestyle of Pang Meixiong from Datong University, and the breaststroke of Shen Yipeng from Fudan University have all achieved considerable success. The Wang Tiesheng and Wang Gangsheng brothers from Jiaotong University are also not to be underestimated. Dongwu's strongman Qian Renze did not register, and St. John's ace Cao Xingkang also did not participate due to a foot injury. In the women's group, because Liu Tianjuan from St. John's is in Hong Kong, all participants have a chance to win. There are many young talents in the elementary school group, and special achievements are expected to emerge. Among them, Xu Dingjiu from the Municipal Hongkou Pool Elementary School will surely make a name for himself. The number cloths for athletes in each group will be distributed starting tomorrow afternoon at the Hongkou Swimming Pool, and the competition schedule and group lists will also be announced tomorrow.

### Jiangwan Swimming Pool Initiates Open Swimming Competition; Scheduled to Be Held Before the End of This Month

The Shanghai Jiangwan Swimming Pool Management Committee held its second plenary meeting at the Municipal Gymnasium yesterday. Committee members Peng Zhenqiu, Shao Rugan, and Jiang Xiangqing attended. Chairman Wu Bangwei presided over the meeting, discussing economic issues related to the swimming pool and the closing date. It was decided that the swimming pool would remain open until the 29th, and an open swimming competition would be held in the city before the end of the month, jointly organized by the Jiangwan Swimming Pool, the Hongkou Swimming Pool, and the Swimming Committee of the Shanghai Sports Association. According to the Jiangwan Swimming Pool, since its opening more than 20 days ago, due to inconvenient transportation, the income has only been over 10 billion yuan, which is not enough to cover expenses, and with the weather turning cooler, it is necessary to close early.

### Also Talking About Hollywood

— Shi Yu

Hollywood has influenced the behavior and morals of millions of people and controlled the thoughts and emotions of millions of people. It presumptuously decides your outlook on life for you; it unintentionally paves the road of life for you. You go to the cinema for fun, but when you come out, it has already "educated" you. Betty Grable's thighs and Joan Crawford's shoulders are not just entertaining you. Charles Boyer, a veteran of the love scene, has become a model for how many sensitive fellows should act? Once "Gone with the Wind" was released, that "Gone with the Wind" novel actually sold an extra million copies. All of this is enough to show that Hollywood has a deeply rooted power, but whether that power is good or bad is worth considering. The [Blank] magazine has quite the ambition to answer this question. It sent out hundreds of letters, soliciting opinions from all sides. In general, with the exception of producers and film executives, almost everyone is attacking Hollywood. They listed twelve charges, completely "exposing the family secrets."

Hollywood's biggest crime is distorting facts and giving people a morbid education. Educators and historians loudly attack the unfaithfulness of biographical films, saying that Tyrone Power in "Suez" portrayed the solemn Lesseps as a playboy, and that "A Song to Remember" also absurdly depicted the life of Chopin. Hollywood often depicts many professionals with great disrespect, to the point that people think that American journalists are mostly alcoholics, lawyers are mostly cunning, and psychiatrists are mostly naive. Hollywood's ridicule of non-whites is most likely to hinder international understanding. The blacks we see on the screen are either stretching their necks to tap dance or are like organ ghosts. The average person hardly knows that there are also black educators and entrepreneurs in the United States. To this day, whenever there are Chinese people on the screen, then shrouds, queues, and water pipes will still be brought out to make white people laugh. Sociologists have been complaining about Hollywood's encouragement of drunkenness, manufacturing of divorces, and stimulation of crime for twenty years. A young woman told the judge the reason for her divorce: "Hasn't that female star divorced five times already?" Various novel love films have caused people's concepts of chastity to become increasingly weak, and they regard marriage as child's play. Many people feel that divorce is something to boast about, so divorce cases are piling up. The increase in juvenile crime is largely due to the suggestion of James Cagney's so-called "daring." It is estimated that 33 million American young masters go to the cinema every lunar period. Theater owners get a headache when they see this group of young masters because they often chisel through seats, use slingshots in the lobby, and even set fires!

Hollywood has been around in China for decades. In this city, I am afraid that not a few are inextricably linked to it. But what has Hollywood given us? I have many friends who have to watch Western movies three times a week. And they never make a choice. I am sure that the "education" they get from Hollywood is more than they get from school. They are almost all clever, well-groomed, whistling, and shrugging their shoulders. Everything has a strong buttery taste. They are all pursuing a scholar's dream. This "scholar" is also being pursued by many Europeans, namely: "An income of $50,000 a year, a refrigerator, a car, and the ability to divorce at any time when you feel annoyed."

We have given Hollywood a lot of foreign exchange, and Hollywood naturally has to give us something!

[Mr. Gao Chuiwan's Poetry Manuscripts]

### The Death of Mr. Zhu Ziqing (Part 2)

— Xie Bingying

The above is an introduction to Mr. Ziqing's resume and his works. Below, I would also like to describe his illness and his poverty, which I think readers are most concerned about and willing to know.

As early as twenty years ago, Mr. Ziqing had duodenal inflammation. In 1941, it is said that he had an X-ray in a hospital in Chengdu and found signs of gastric ulcer, but Mr. Ziqing did not pay attention. He devoted his entire spirit to academic research and forgot about his health. Starting in May of this year, his body weakened to the extreme. He, who never asked for leave, is now asking for leave. On the morning of August 6th, he suddenly had severe stomach pain. He thought it was appendicitis. He went to the Peking University Affiliated Hospital for treatment at 11:00 AM that day. After examination and photography by the doctor, it was determined to be a gastric ulcer. He underwent surgery at 2:00 PM, which took 40 minutes. The surgery went very well. During the surgery, it was found that the duodenum was rotten with a hole about half an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide, so the doctor quickly sewed it up. According to Dr. Zhang, ordinary patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia require a dose of up to 200 or 300 cc, but for Mr. Ziqing this time, he was afraid that he would not be able to bear it, so he only used 100 cc. After waking up, he was in good spirits and said to his friends who came to see him, "The surgery was really fast, it was over in a quarter of an hour!"

The next day, an examination of the urine revealed protein and granular casts. The doctor determined that he had nephritis. At this time, doctors from internal and external departments studied in detail. The most difficult problem to solve was that if he only had a gastric ulcer, he could not eat, and he could inject a little more glucose and saline, but with nephritis added, it was troublesome, because it was the opposite of the former, and he could not inject glucose and saline. According to Dr. Zhang, Mr. Zhu's temperature has not been high since he was hospitalized, always around 37 degrees, but he urinates very little. After four days, his hands and feet were sometimes cold. On the 11th, he gradually urinated more, and his face was not as pale as in the previous days, and he seemed to have returned to normal. He also had a bowel movement that night. But the next day, the situation changed again. When Mr. Zhu exerted himself to have a bowel movement at 9:20, he suddenly felt particularly difficult to breathe. Originally, he had been using oxygen to help him breathe and injecting glucose and plasma these days. At 11:30, Mr. Zhu's life had reached its most dangerous stage. His pulse stopped, and his last breath was cut off. He said farewell to this dirty and chaotic world with infinite pain and reluctance!

It is said that he only said one sentence when he was dying, in a very subtle voice: "The doctors have done their best!" Finally, he waved to his youngest daughter, who came closer. He took one last look and closed his eyes.

Mrs. Zhu, Chen Zhuyin, saw her dearest person die with her own eyes. She fainted at that time. The first thing she said when she woke up was: "Quickly send a telegram to your eldest brother and second brother!" Sadly, their second son, Run Sheng, remitted a sum of money from Nanjing on the 11th, but his father could not enjoy it.

Mr. Ziqing left behind four sons and four daughters, four children each from his first wife and his second wife. His youngest daughter is only ten years old and is studying at Qinghua Chengzhi Elementary School. This is his most beloved little baby. Mr. Ziqing was honest and upright throughout his life. After his death, during the funeral, he could not find a decent piece of clothing, which was really miserable!

Most writers have a common habit: they don't like to fill out resumes. Once, a famous professor wrote "An Old Man" on his resume and sent it back to the school where he taught. Mr. Ziqing's temperament was a bit similar, and he never liked to fill out forms. The National Peiping Library once asked him to fill out a form. He said, "I have never liked to fill out forms in my life, so I will not comply." This spring, another form was sent to him, still asking him to fill it out. He replied, "When I am teaching, I often feel inconvenient when I want to introduce a certain writer to my students because of the lack of materials. This time you want me to fill out a form, and I will never refuse!" (The general idea) So he filled out a very detailed form. This article about Mr. Ziqing's resume and works is based on the form he filled out himself.

Mr. Ziqing is dead. Although his body has been cremated to ashes, his spirit is entrusted to his works, influencing thousands of young intellectuals, forever immortal, and forever shining brilliantly in the literary world! (August 15, 1948, in the ancient capital.) Jin Lin

### Quirks

— Jin Lin

American writer Hawthorne always washed his hands before reading his wife's letters.

British writer Farrer wrote all his works standing up.

British novelist Stevenson insisted on using purple ink.

French philosopher Rousseau liked to wear black gloves in the summer. When he traveled abroad, he insisted on packing the things in the box separately.

### The Sinking of Liuyi Town

— Suo Bei

Liuyi Town on the Yangtze River in Yangzhou suddenly sounded a blast on the 16th of this month, and the entire town sank. The former prosperous streets did not leave a trace. The small society that was once a transportation hub where merchants and travelers stopped has disappeared into the rushing east flow in an instant! Mulberry fields turn into seas, and human affairs are impermanent. It can be regarded as the common sense of the universe, or it can be regarded as the sorrow of the "spirit of all things," whose splendor and all civilizations are often built on beaches that can sink at any time (or after countless years).

Don't accuse me of "raising the alarm": Liuyi Town can sink in an instant, and the Shanghai Bund is unlikely to be preserved in an instant! Doesn't the Shanghai stratum sink by one or two inches every year? It is difficult to say that the entire oasis will never end, let alone the alluvial beach formed by Shanghai.

Indeed, natural sinking may occur in hundreds of millions of years, but haven't you heard that countless people are working on the manufacture of atomic bombs (or super atomic bombs)? In that case, the "spirit of all things" not only does not consider whether natural sinking can be prevented, but is also working on artificial sinking!

The ancient old capital recently saw the passing of another old scholar. Lu Jing, styled Muzhai, a successful candidate in the Hubei provincial examinations, formerly served as the education commissioner of Zhili and Fengtian provinces during the late Qing dynasty. Renowned for his collection of books and archaeological studies, he passed away on the tenth of this month at the age of ninety-four! Adding the intercalary month, he could be considered a centenarian. This venerable gentleman, alongside Li Shengduo of Jiangxi (a successful candidate placed second in the imperial examinations, deceased for many years), were equally matched in the richness of their collections and the accuracy of their appraisals, remarkably both using "Muzhai" as their sobriquet.

August 8th is Father's Day. Wu Zhihui, the venerable gentleman who inscribed the calligraphy (as seen in the copperplate print in the Japanese newspaper), is eighty-four years old, more than a decade older than the average septuagenarian, truly a person of exceptional longevity, yet still ten years younger than the venerable Lu. General Sa (Zhenbing) of Fujian province, who celebrated his ninetieth birthday, is four years younger than Lu. The Shanghai resident Chen (Kuilong), formerly a high-ranking official, is now ninety-two, two years older than Sa but still two years younger than Lu. (Editor's note: Chen Yonglao passed away on August 17th.) When Marshal Pétain of the Vichy French puppet government sought peace with Germany in 1940, he was already eighty-four years old (equivalent to the Chinese age of eighty-five), and now he should be ninety-two (Chinese age ninety-three), still one number behind Lu.

Old Wu's inscription uses an interesting combination of the ancient seal script and modern analysis of the character "father." According to reports, "Father's Day" was originally jointly proposed five years ago by Dr. Yen Hui-ching, Dr. Mei Lanfang, and other prominent figures residing in Shanghai, on the grounds that "both father and mother should be equally honored and valued. Knowing the father but not the mother is contrary to human nature, but knowing the mother and not the father is surely a matter of regret?" It is a parallel phrase that is both sincere and elegant. The explanation of the character's form states: "The linked eights resemble the character 'father' and the sound is similar to 'baba' (dad)." This also demonstrates ingenuity.

The relative importance and closeness of father and mother are difficult to express in a single sentence. Generally speaking, in early human history, when the patriarchal system was incomplete, people were born from the mother and raised in her arms, so they knew only the mother and not the father. Later, as the family was established, ethics became clearer, male authority became dominant, and women had to follow their husbands. The relationship between parents showed a clear distinction in importance. The father's relatives were regarded as the head of the family, while the mother's side was considered the "outside family." Although both parents are addressed together in the same hall, in terms of the family, it is almost as if "one knows only the father and not the mother." Although Western families also value the male lineage, there is no difference in the closeness between relatives on the father's and mother's sides. Therefore, Roosevelt married his "cousin." In China, marrying a "cousin" is common, but marrying a "paternal cousin" is considered "incestuous" - that is unthinkable! In fact, the distance between uncles and maternal uncles, aunts and maternal aunts, paternal and maternal cousins of the same generation, is exactly the same on both parents' sides, and it is perfectly reasonable to refer to both sides with the same terms. As for the Western custom of having a Mother's Day, it is said that when soldiers were serving in the military, the elderly mother leaned against the door, or if the soldiers died in military service, the mother's grief and disappointment were even greater than the father's. Therefore, there is a special reason for having a Mother's Day, and it is not to show partiality between the two parents. The establishment of "Father's Day" by prominent figures in China is not unacceptable, and there is no need to make an unfair outcry. Both can coexist or go their own way.

(Editor's note: Western countries also have Father's Day, when children give gifts to their fathers, but the holiday falls on the third Sunday in June each year, which is different from our country's Father's Day.)

### Escape from Death

— Ye Qiu

In 1926, in a state prison in Florida, USA, there was a black prisoner named Jem Williams, who was sentenced to death and scheduled for execution. On the day of the execution, the warden and the district chief in charge of the case called out Williams, strapped him to the electric chair, and put the black mask on his head, waiting for the button to be pressed to pass the electricity. Unexpectedly, both the prison official and the district chief were very soft-hearted people, and everyone shirked responsibility and refused to act. The two men argued for twenty minutes without a resolution, while Williams suffered in the electric chair for twenty minutes. As a result, the authorities ordered Williams to be untied and sent back to his cell. Later, the judge felt that Williams' twenty minutes of "waiting to die" was already a heavy punishment, so he reduced his sentence to life imprisonment. Eight years later, Williams risked his life to save two people on the prison farm. The judge saw that he still knew justice and released him.
