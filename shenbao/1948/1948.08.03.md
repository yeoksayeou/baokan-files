### Amendment to Customs Import Tariff - Presidential Decree Promulgated and Implemented - Taxes on Luxury and Non-Essential Goods Increased

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The President issued a decree on the 2nd promulgating the amended Customs Import Tariff, effective immediately. This amendment to the tax rates was previously drafted by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. After being reported to the 16th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on June 29th, it was referred to the Finance and Monetary Committee of the Yuan for secret review. On July 30th, a review report with proposed amendments was submitted. After further discussion and amendment at the Yuan's third secret meeting, it was sent back to the Executive Yuan. After the Executive Yuan instructed the customs authorities to prepare for implementation, the President issued a decree for its promulgation and implementation. The Customs Import Tariff is divided into sixteen categories with six hundred and seventy-two items. Except for the agreed tariff rates limited by the Geneva Agreement passed by the United Nations Trade and Employment Conference and the reduction rates that our country has agreed to recognize, which will continue to be observed, and the tax rates on essential goods for economic construction and urgent necessities for people's livelihood, which will not be increased, the import tariff rates on all other luxury goods, non-essential goods for the general public, or goods that can be produced in large quantities domestically, and for the sake of protecting industry, will be increased separately according to their use, processing procedures, and relationship with domestic goods (whether they are competing products), with an average increase of one to three times the original tariff rate, with the highest reaching 200%. However, there are also some tariff items for which duty exemptions will be granted to encourage imports. The amended Customs Import Tariff is recorded as follows:

Customs Import Tariff of the Republic of China, Year 37

[Tax Collection Method for Mixtures] When liquids or other goods are imported in a mixed state, and the customs authorities have difficulty determining the value of their components, unless otherwise specified in the tariff, the entire mixture shall be taxed according to the highest tariff rate of the constituent substances.

[Notes for Categories I, II, III, IV] If piece goods or knitted fabrics contain multiple types of fibers, and the proportion of each fiber by weight does not exceed 5%, it will not affect the tariff classification.

If cotton, linen, ramie, hemp, jute, wool, or silk (mulberry silk or artificial silk) products are sewn, bordered, hemmed, or trimmed with other materials different from themselves, it will not affect the tariff classification.

For goods containing lace, ornaments, or other decorative materials, in addition to paying duty according to the tariff of the goods, an additional ad valorem tax of 10% shall be levied.

[Note for Category IV] The term "silk" in this tariff includes artificial silk. The term "artificial silk" includes artificial fibers other than artificial silk and other synthetic fibers for textile use.

Mixed yarn made of cotton or wool and more than 5% (by weight) of artificial silk (including artificial fibers and other synthetic fibers for textile use) shall be classified and taxed as artificial silk. If the weight of the artificial silk yarn (including artificial fibers and other synthetic fibers for textile use) is 5% or less, it shall be taxed as cotton yarn or wool yarn.

Blended yarn made of cotton or wool and 50% or more (by weight) of artificial wool yarn or matte artificial fiber or other synthetic matte fiber for textile use shall be classified and taxed as artificial wool yarn.

All other members of the three committees are free to participate. As for the review process, after the preliminary review, the order will remain comprehensive review (three groups jointly), joint review (three committees jointly), and plenary discussion.

### Kuomintang Central Committee to Hold Symposium Today - Broadly Soliciting Opinions on Improving Party Affairs

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The Kuomintang Party Affairs Symposium will open on the 3rd. It is rumored that the President does not intend to attend and preside over it. The main purpose of the meeting is only to present opinions on party affairs, conduct a broad review, and the reform plan previously drafted by Hong Lanyou has been decided not to be submitted for discussion at the meeting. Other proposals, such as the "Opinions on Reforming the Party" drafted by Xu Xiaoyan and others and the "Draft Reform Measures" drafted by Li Tianmin and others, will be submitted for discussion at the meeting. If any specific contributions are made in the various opinions presented at the meeting, separate plans will be drafted, but no resolutions will be made at the meeting.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Hong Lanyou's party affairs improvement plan still needs to be passed by the Central Standing Committee, then submitted to the Director-General for review, and then handed over to the Plenary Session for discussion. According to Hong, the spirit of the plan is to seek the linkage of party affairs and politics, using political reform as the driving force for party affairs reform.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] In order to listen to and solicit opinions from central committee members and legislative and supervisory committee comrades in Nanjing on improving party affairs, the Kuomintang Central Committee has scheduled a party affairs symposium to be held at the National Assembly Hall starting on the 3rd.

### Suppression War Launched in Northern Jiangsu - Powerful Army Corps Moves South Along the Grand Canal Line - Situation Tense in Northern Anhui, Situation Unclear in Yingshang

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 2nd] The National Army in Northern Jiangsu has begun to suppress the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. A powerful army corps is moving south along the Grand Canal line and its branches to launch a wide-ranging encirclement and suppression of the bandits who are roving in Northern Jiangsu. Also, the main forces of the 2nd, 11th, and 12th Columns of bandits who are harassing the Siyang and Suqian areas fled east and west separately on the 1st.

### Situation in Northeast Continues to Unfold - Land, Sea, and Air Forces Cooperating in Southern Liaoning

[Our Newspaper, Jinzhou, 2nd] The situation in Southern Liaoning and Western Liaoning in the Northeast shows signs of continuing to unfold, especially in Southern Liaoning. Currently, land, sea, and air forces are cooperating in action. A strong army in Western Liaoning has arrived at a certain port and seems to be landing in Yingkou after the Bohai Fleet bombed Yingkou, adopting a posture of flanking with the National Army moving south from Shenyang to defeat the bandit army in Southern Liaoning. Western Liaoning is also making new deployments with new forces, and there are new actions. The air force is traveling between Liaoyang and Western Liaoning, conducting close reconnaissance and liaison work to restore the advantage of the Yingkou, Huludao, and Beining Railway line in the Northeast to break the difficult situation in the Northeast. Currently, in addition to intensifying the attack on Changchun with superior forces, the bandits on the east bank of the Daling River in Western Liaoning have also transferred a force from Northern Liaoning to concentrate in the Beizhen and Lvyangyi area, seemingly to contain and hinder the new actions of the National Army in Western Liaoning. Refugees and merchants traveling between Shenyang and Jinzhou are strictly prevented from crossing the Daling River by the bandits, who often shoot at those attempting to cross. Others are prevented from continuing west from Shenyang in Xinmin West to strictly seal off the area between Shenyang and Jinzhou. All of this indicates that the National Army is about to launch a proactive battle to break the deadlock.

[Our Newspaper, Jinzhou, 1st] The situation in Western Liaoning has developed in various aspects over the past month. Militarily, there will be a proactive attack recently. Industrially, after the resumption of work at the China Textile Corporation's Jinzhou Factory, it first opened 5,000 spindles, and now it has opened another 5,000 spindles. If the environment improves further, it can restore the highest target of 45,000 spindles last year. Railway transportation is normal. Food supplies are continuously recovering due to several good rains, and general prices are also falling, and the people have a slight smile on their faces. The military and local people have established a Cultural Promotion Association and a Cultural Hall, which are promoting the culture of Western Liaoning with Jinzhou as the core.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Amid the brewing of a new economic policy, the capital's Central Daily News published an article on the 2nd discussing the key to economic reform, titled "If One Step is Missed, All is Lost."

### Editorial: The Touchstone of Shanghai's Tycoons

The deadline for soliciting donations for the relief special levy has been extended repeatedly, stipulated to be the end of July; however, of the 8.5 trillion yuan in the Shanghai area (including Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places), it is heard that less than a quarter has been raised to date. The President in Nanking mentioned this matter some time ago, and Mayor Wu also made some remarks at yesterday's Bandit Suppression and Espionage Elimination Propaganda Conference, hoping that Shanghai's tycoons can all be charitable, otherwise, the fundraising will be taken a step further to fulfill the mission. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Area Relief Special Levy Fundraising Committee held a meeting. Although the details of its resolution are not yet known as of this writing, we believe that the gentlemen in charge of fundraising will definitely give Shanghai's tycoons an excellent opportunity to donate generously. And the tycoons of Shanghai, thinking quietly at night, will certainly enthusiastically donate and display their spirit of "treating all people as siblings" and "feeling hungry when others are hungry" to do good.

We believe that although the deadline for the relief special levy has passed, the fundraising work should not be stopped immediately. Not only should it not be stopped, but it should be especially strengthened. In particular, those tycoons who possess wealth and can greatly help should see this relief special levy as a touchstone for their own conduct. Originally, relieving the poor and helping those in distress is everyone's duty, and human mutual assistance is inherent in human nature. Moreover, since tycoons have surplus capacity, at this time when refugees are everywhere and wounded soldiers fill the eyes, a single thought of compassion can naturally lead them to open their wallets and provide relief, without the need for us to say more. However, there are some short-sighted misers who often love money like their lives, truly "unwilling to pluck a single hair to benefit the world." Therefore, Jesus Christ once said, "It is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle." However, we imagine that the tycoons of Shanghai are probably not so foolish as to be so miserly.

In the world, "things will cry out when they are not balanced." Therefore, bandit suppression and espionage elimination cannot be solely blamed on the soldiers fighting desperately at the front, nor can we stand by and watch the refugees in the bandit areas and on the battlefields suffer the pain of displacement and wandering in ditches, and especially cannot let only those people sacrifice and suffer, while some of us who still have surplus capacity only indulge in extravagance and luxury, thinking that it is none of our business. The phenomenon of "vermilion gates reeking of wine and meat while the roads are littered with frozen corpses" will never be allowed to last long. When society has such a morbid state, it definitely needs the right medicine!

Today, if the tycoons of Shanghai take a broader view, they will certainly think that having wealth but not being able to distribute it, and distributing wealth but not using it well, is not good for the public or private, for the country or for themselves. Moreover, after reading the Chinese Communist Party's announcement supporting the Comintern Information Bureau's resolution condemning the Yugoslav Communist Party, we can more clearly recognize the true attitude of the Chinese Communists towards the general property owners (whether they are big capitalists or petty bourgeoisie) is absolute liquidation, without leaving the slightest leeway. Then, we should know that the government's bandit suppression and the society's espionage elimination are not only to protect the country's independence and the nation's survival, but in fact, the most protected beneficiaries are the wealthy people with assets. Understanding this point, why not take advantage of the fact that the National Army is actively suppressing and the Communist bandits are struggling, quickly do what is possible, generously donate to relieve refugees, relieve wounded soldiers, and relieve the poor and helpless people, alleviate the government's worries, seek treatment for society, contribute to the country in a big way, and create blessings for future generations in a small way. Do they really have to wait until they are at the end of their rope and the Communist bandits' knives are on their heads before they donate money? Remember two years ago, Speaker Pan said, "Shanghai is the most luxurious and extravagant city in the country, but why did it suffer less damage during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War than other places? The reason may be due to the charitable acts of disaster relief and neighborly assistance in the past few decades, with Shanghai's donations being second to none. The so-called city of accumulated good deeds must have surplus blessings, and this is still due to the legacy of the elders who were happy to do good." Although these words seem to be about cause and effect, they may still be able to encourage the general tycoons of Shanghai today. We believe that they will certainly continue the achievements of their predecessors, carry them forward, and make efforts for the country and create blessings for the society again.

Finally, we want to advise the wealthy gentlemen of Shanghai: why not first inquire about the people who used to live comfortable lives in the bandit areas, and how are they now? We know that in many places, once they have fallen, they deeply regret not having donated earlier to make the National Army well-fed and well-mounted to defend against the Communist bandits outside their homeland. Now, Shanghai is still a relatively stable place, and if the people of Shanghai do not contribute money now, they may regret it too late! And we also want to tell the mayor and the members of the fundraising committee: they should quickly, based on the reports from various parties, release a list of the gentlemen in Shanghai who are relatively wealthy but still not donating, so that everyone can comment on them and see who is "worthy of donation by all the people," so as to mobilize the power of the society to persuade these tycoons to donate money one by one, to relieve suffering and difficulties, to save the country and save themselves!

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 2nd] According to Hong Kong news: Recently, because the border checkpoints between China and Hong Kong have been repeatedly attacked by bandits, anti-smuggling work has become very difficult. After the Ma Shi Wan checkpoint was forced to retreat, the surrounding area has become a paradise for smugglers. In order to remedy this major loss, Kowloon Customs Commissioner Gorges will go to Shanghai in the short term to discuss remedial measures with the general customs. According to Ma Shi Wan, which is Hong Kong's territorial sea, we cannot send ships to patrol and arrest along the coast before the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement, and most of the coastline is occupied by corrupt merchants, making arrests difficult. Therefore, unless the Sino-Hong Kong agreement can be implemented immediately, smuggling will never be eradicated.

### Three Envoys Request Meeting with Stalin Awaiting Official Soviet Response Lifting of Berlin Blockade Must Precede Four-Power Talks

[United Press International, Moscow, 2nd] The representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are currently awaiting Stalin's response regarding their request to meet with him to discuss the German problem. It is generally anticipated that Stalin's reply may be presented today. If he agrees, the meeting will be held immediately or within a few days. Sources close to the Western diplomatic representatives state that they will present Stalin with a simple two-point proposal, decided upon during the London discussions. This proposal requests the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade, after which the four powers will consult on the entire Berlin situation. This consultation may take the form of a meeting of foreign ministers. If Stalin refuses to meet with the Western envoys, they will present this proposal to Molotov.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 1st, United Press International] Well-informed sources say that Western diplomats have requested a meeting with Stalin, hoping to implore him personally to lift the blockade of Berlin and agree to a formal four-power conference on the entire German problem. An official at the French Embassy in the Soviet Union confirmed that the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have requested direct access to Stalin, and Molotov is considering the matter. It is understood that the Western nations will suggest a news blackout when they begin discussions with Stalin or Molotov; therefore, there will be no news to report unless Moscow, Paris, London, and Washington simultaneously announce the progress of the negotiations. Bevin's private secretary, Roberts, had dinner at the American Embassy with American Ambassador Smith. Experts from the British, French, and American embassies held meetings to discuss reports to be sent to their respective governments.

[Central News Agency, London, 1st] The early return of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Moscow to meet with the three Western envoys has created a good impression here, with many believing it is an auspicious sign. According to The Sunday Times today, Bevin remained in London over the weekend to study reports from the Moscow talks. The talks may produce the following results: The four-power Berlin Control Commission may reconvene to resolve the currency dispute. If this succeeds, Stalin, Truman, Attlee, and French Prime Minister Marie will negotiate directly. The newspaper also stated that such negotiations between the four-power leaders would not be trapped in an abyss of doubt and fear and would therefore have a better chance of achieving some results.

### Soviet Representative Vyshinsky Proposes Draft of Danube River Convention Proposes New Committee with No Permanent Speaking Rights for the US

[United Press International, Belgrade, 2nd] Soviet representative to the Danube River Conference, Vyshinsky, presented a draft of the Danube River Convention on the 2nd, proposing the establishment of a new Danube River Committee, with each riparian state sending one representative, except for Austria, which may participate after the peace treaty is signed. This committee would replace the committee formed after World War I by Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. The United States is currently participating due to its occupation of Germany and Austria but would have no permanent speaking rights. Vyshinsky's proposal surprised the United Kingdom and the United States, and it was presented close to the end of the meeting.

Soviet Bloc Dominance

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] Moscow Radio reported that the Danube countries have defeated the Western countries. On the first day of the conference, the Western countries attempted to impose their conditions on the Danube countries. The Danube countries resisted strongly, leading to the failure of their attempt to seize the thousands of kilometers of the great European river, amend the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and delay the meeting for their own benefit.

### Soviets Allocate Large Sums to Develop Railway Transport

[United Press International, Washington, 2nd] Representative McDowell, a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, stated on the 2nd that the committee will investigate the current jobs of the 30 officials identified by Bentley as having provided her with information during the war. The Senate Investigating Committee has reconvened Dumnington, a government economic expert who was allegedly identified by Bentley as having provided wartime production figures. Ray denied that he provided Bentley with any information other than what she could have read in the newspapers. The committee will also hear a report from Bordenze on the 2nd, who served as a communist editor for many years before defecting from Moscow and joining the Sacred Heart Catholic Church. The Un-American Activities Committee is scheduled to hold a concluding meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd to decide on the order to subpoena the officials identified by Bentley.

The Department of the Army also stated that a new cold-resistant grease has been invented that can be used as a lubricant in both the Arctic and the scorching desert. Twelve Army trucks have now gone to California deserts and Alaska for testing, and the effectiveness of the new grease will be carefully observed along the way.

[United Press International, Rome, 2nd] The usually reliable "Time" newspaper predicts that Italian Communist leader Togliatti, who is currently recuperating in northern Italy, will be replaced by a more "Bolshevik" Italian Communist official to manage party affairs. The newspaper stated that the second-in-command of the Italian Communist Party, former guerrilla commander Longo, or political strategist Chichia, will succeed Togliatti in controlling the party leadership and adopt a more proactive direct action policy. The report interprets Togliatti's request that Italian Communist friends visit him less often and his claim that he needs long-term recuperation as an indication of retirement.

During yesterday's review meeting, representatives from various utility companies stated that the increase in various relevant cost factors was too large, and requested a very high adjustment rate. They unanimously insisted that the adjustment standard must balance cash receipts and expenditures. However, because the funds needed to purchase oil and coal have been approved by the Public Utilities Bureau for lending by the National Bank, and the Exchange Control Board and the Fuel Management Committee have agreed to the principle of one-time exchange settlement, this will reduce the costs of various public utilities, so the Public Utilities Bureau strongly suppressed the adjustment rate for this month. It is said that the meeting lasted for six or seven hours of contention.

### New Director of Gold Control Bureau Takes Office, Promising Impartiality and No Favoritism; Explains Attitude in Implementing Policies

[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Lin Chongyong, the newly appointed Director of the Gold Control Bureau of this city, took office at the bureau at 9 a.m. yesterday. President Yu of the Central Bank and people from all walks of life came to congratulate him. At 5 p.m., Mr. Lin held a reception for reporters, explaining his basic attitude in implementing control policies in the future, stating briefly: The Gold Control Bureau was established seven months ago, and under the leadership of Director Li, a good foundation has already been established, and its style is rarely criticized. In addition to following established procedures, I will implement control orders with an attitude of impartiality and no favoritism. I believe that the current control laws and regulations have no loopholes in their methods. As for the importance and urgency of implementation, they will be adapted to the circumstances and have a sense of proportion. The basic principles of managing banks in the future will be to fully comply with the Banking Law and strengthen the basic spirit of the Financial Control Regulations, such as Articles 17, 32, 33, and 43 of the Banking Law, which aim to prohibit banks from engaging in commercial speculation, misusing bank funds, and creating false accounts. If these can be effectively implemented, there is no need for other supplementary laws, and the actual effect of management can be achieved.

Bank Operations Not on the Right Track

The current development of the financial industry in our country is extremely distorted. The number of banks is rare in all countries in the world, and the abuse of credit is also unprecedented in any period. There are some banks in this city whose expenditures are even greater than the total amount of deposits, and they have been able to maintain themselves in the past. This also shows that the income from their use of deposits is greater than their expenditures. The fact that their operations are not on the right track can be seen from this. This type of abnormal situation can indicate the severity of the economic situation. If we allow it to continue to deteriorate, not only will these unhealthy banks not be able to survive, but even healthy ones will perish together.

Definitely Will Not Harm Legitimate Banks

The Gold Control Bureau's attitude towards banks will be to distinguish between right and wrong, promote good and eliminate evil. Currently, among the banks in this city, the difference between good and bad is immeasurable. When implementing controls, banks with sound operations will be given appropriate protection, and the operations of legitimate banks will definitely not be harmed. Bad banks will be treated with absolutely no leniency and will be eliminated.

Speculative Venues All Have Leads

Director Lin finally stated again: The government is determined to crack down on speculation and hoarding. All possible speculative venues have leads, and by following these clues, criminals will surely be caught. Before taking office, I met with the highest authorities and stated that the success or failure of financial control depends not only on the efforts of the Gold Control Bureau, but also on the attitude of the government. Financial control aims to stabilize prices and is actually intended for the livelihood of all ordinary people, so it should receive the greatest support from all parties. In particular, it is hoped that guidance and cooperation can be obtained from the media. As for the inspection of banks, this is a regular system in foreign countries. Our country is currently in economic chaos, so it is even more necessary. [Reported by this newspaper] Two postal ships of the American President Lines will arrive in Shanghai one after another this afternoon; one is the General Gordon, which is coming from Hong Kong via Little Luzon, arriving at the port at 11 a.m. today and departing from Shanghai at 12 noon tomorrow via Yokohama to return to the United States. Also, the postal ship Cleveland, which is coming to Shanghai from San Francisco via Honolulu and Yokohama, arrived at the port at 10 a.m. this morning, berthing at the Gonghexiang Wharf, and will set sail at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow to Hong Kong, Little Luzon, and then return to San Francisco via Honolulu.

### Shipping Industry Urgently Wants to Raise Prices; Appeals to Ministry of Transportation

[Reported by this newspaper] The matter of adjusting passenger and freight rates in the shipping industry was originally scheduled to be implemented starting yesterday (the 2nd), but the Ministry of Transportation has not yet issued an approval. The Shipping Association convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, and as a result, urgently telegraphed the Ministry again, because prices have soared crazily again recently, requesting consideration of the difficulties of shipping merchants and prompt approval. It is also heard that the shipping industry plans to implement the price increase tomorrow, increasing freight rates by 120% and ticket prices by 60%, but whether it can be implemented as scheduled tomorrow will still depend on the orders of the Ministry of Transportation.

### China National Aviation Corporation Orders New Aircraft; Difficult to Transport for the Time Being

[Reported by this newspaper] Several senior personnel from the China National Aviation Corporation who were sent to the United States for investigation and training have returned to China yesterday. The six Convair twin-engine passenger planes ordered by the company from the Convair Aircraft Factory have not yet been delivered, because the new passenger planes have very good performance. Each engine has 2,400 horsepower, and the speed per hour reaches 300 miles, and the take off and landing does not necessarily require a large-scale airport. Therefore, the domestic demand for this fast passenger plane in the United States is also very urgent. The Convair factory has a backlog of orders, and the China National Aviation Corporation's orders will only be able to be transported to China after several months.

### Taikoo's Jintang Ship, Seized by Japan, Returned from Japan and Arrived in Shanghai

[Reported by this newspaper] The Jintang, a regular liner of Taikoo Company's Yichang-Chongqing route on the Yangtze River, retreated to Shanghai and anchored on the Huangpu River when the Sino-Japanese War broke out and the Yangtze River was blockaded. Later, it was seized by the Japanese army and towed to Japan for repairs, and renamed Asahi Azuma Maru. After the victory, the company learned about the situation and immediately requested negotiations from the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan. It has now been verified and returned, and arrived in Shanghai on Saturday evening last week, berthing at the Taikoo Pudong Wharf. The ship is still being driven by Japanese for this trip, with a crew of 29 people. The Allied Headquarters sent two American soldiers to escort it to Shanghai. The company will take over in the next few days, and the Japanese crew members will be repatriated to their country. The ship has a gross tonnage of 435 tons and a net tonnage of 221 tons. Because it sails on the Sichuan River, its horsepower is strong, totaling 1,700 horsepower. After being seized and repaired by the Japanese army, it has been completely renewed.

### Mass Rally for Suppression of Rebellion and Elimination of Traitors; Speaker Calls on the Wealthy to Contribute Wealth and Jointly Face National Crisis

The Shanghai Municipal Mass Rally for Suppression of Rebellion and Elimination of Traitors was held enthusiastically at the Cultural Hall on Zhabu Road at 8 a.m. yesterday. More than a thousand representatives from municipal military and political organizations and other social groups attended, with Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Director Fang Zhi of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters, Director Jin Longzhang of the Democratic Socialist Party Municipal Party Headquarters, and Chairman Shui Xiangyun of the General Labor Union serving as the presidium. First, General Chairman Pan delivered the opening speech, stating briefly: "We are holding this mass rally for suppression of rebellion and elimination of traitors today, and representatives from various groups are enthusiastically participating, which is enough to represent the wishes of all citizens. Regarding the work of suppressing rebellion and eliminating traitors, we must strengthen our understanding of the current serious situation. (1) In the three years since victory, our country has failed to actively engage in production and construction, which has affected our low international status, all caused by the

Communist bandits' internal strife.

These national scum, in order to realize their ambitions, do not hesitate to undermine consultations and drive the people of the whole country to wander in the ditches of poverty, hunger, and death, in order to make China a war base for the Third International. After the conspiracy of the Communist bandits was exposed, the government could no longer tolerate it and issued a general mobilization order to suppress the rebellion, expressing its position and determination. Recently, President Weng's "Letter to the People of the Country" clearly reiterated national policy and swept away the rumors of "peace talks." In the future, the people of the country must distinguish between right and wrong and realize the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country with the spirit of jointly facing national crisis. (2) What the Communist bandits have done is treason and not patriotism. The government's

campaign is suppression of rebellion and not civil war. We must recognize this point. The current campaign to suppress bandits and quell the rebellion is a war to maintain national independence and unity. The people of the whole country must contribute their greatest strength to support the soldiers fighting on the front lines. We believe that with the full support of the people of Shanghai for the government's work of suppressing the rebellion, it will be completed quickly. We also hope that under the principle of "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength," the wealthy and powerful will fully contribute their financial resources to meet urgent needs and jointly face national crisis. (3) Among the subordinates of the traitorous bandits, there are many who have been coerced into following them. It is hoped that these people will discover their conscience and repent in time. We believe that the government, under the major premise of the country and the nation, will definitely not hold them accountable for the past, allow them to rehabilitate themselves, and seek the realization of peaceful unification as soon as possible."

Mayor Points Out Three Points

Then, Mayor Wu delivered a speech. After explaining that the Central Committee of the Communist bandits responded to the international communist condemnation of Yugoslavia's proclamation, he pointed out three points: (1) Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia was condemned for patriotism, and the Communist bandits openly responded to the Communist International's proclamation, which shows that they have no concept of the country and the nation, and it is obvious that they have confessed their crimes. (2) In the Communist International's proclamation, the "private ownership of land" system in South Korea was severely criticized. According to this, it can be seen that the Communist bandits' propaganda of "land to the tiller" is just a facade to deceive the world. (3) Yugoslavia was condemned on the grounds of the "People's Front," while the Communist bandits and their supporters are propagating themselves with the slogan "Democratic Front." How can they justify themselves?

Fang Zhi Suggests Sanctioning the Unjust

After that, Democratic Socialist Party Chief Jin Longzhang explained the meaning and necessity of suppressing rebellion and eliminating traitors. Kuomintang Chief Fang immediately put forward three suggestions: (1) Intensify efforts to contribute money and effort to eliminate the Communist bandits who are willing to sell out the country and the nation. (2) Awaken the deceived to repent and return. (3) Mobilize social forces to sanction those who are rich but unkind. These suggestions were enthusiastically applauded by the whole body and immediately telegraphed to the whole country in the name of the conference to unanimously respond. The propaganda conference ended at about 10 a.m., and immediately screened a film to entertain the attending representatives. After the meeting, the Suppression and Traitor Elimination Corps decided to form twelve sub-corps immediately and go to various districts of the city to start propaganda work.

### Handkerchief Industry Workers Resume Work

It has now been decided that the wages for July will be temporarily borrowed at 1.3 million times for the first half of the month, and will be calculated and paid according to the average of the upper and lower index for the current month for the second half of the month. The wages for August are awaiting mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. The wage index for workers in the machine-made sewing industry in this city was originally calculated one month late. Now, after mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs, it has been changed to be calculated according to the index for the current month.

### Diamond Hidden in Toe Crevice: Sharp-Eyed Customs Officer Foils Smuggling Attempt

On August 1st, China Aviation Corporation's flight number 104 from Hong Kong landed in Shanghai. Customs inspectors discovered a diamond hidden within the toe crevice of a passenger surnamed Ye. The inspection process was quite intriguing. Details are as follows: After the plane arrived at the airport, customs officers completed their inspection of all passengers' luggage. Passengers hurried to leave, but one passenger surnamed Ye remained unusually calm, walking slowly and lagging behind, attempting to conceal his smuggling activities. Ironically, this aroused the suspicion of customs officers, who ordered him to stop for a full body search, but found nothing. They then asked him to remove his leather shoes. After careful inspection of the shoes, they found nothing hidden inside. They then asked him to remove his socks and suddenly discovered a rubber bandage-like wrapping around his big toe crevice. They asked Ye whether the rubber bandage was for a wound. Ye immediately appeared flustered. After removing the rubber bandage, they discovered a diamond stuck to it. After confiscating the diamond, customs officers sealed it in an envelope, had the owner sign it for verification, and then took it back to customs for confiscation.

### City's Financial Balance Difficult to View Optimistically: July Shortfall Exceeds 100 Billion; Bureau Chief Engages in Tax Revenue Overhaul

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's preliminary statistics on municipal fiscal revenue and expenditure for July show a total revenue of over 1.5 trillion yuan, more than double that of the previous month. Expenditures for various departments, including operating expenses and the 420,000-fold employee living subsidy advanced for July, totaled over 1.17 trillion yuan. According to central government regulations, the living subsidy for municipal government employees in Shanghai for July is 1.6 million times, and in addition to the 420,000 times already issued, an additional 1.18 million times must be supplemented, requiring more than 1.86 trillion yuan in living subsidies. Director Tian twice went to Beijing to request a central government subsidy of 1.4 trillion yuan, as well as the 300 billion yuan shortfall in July's revenue and expenditure, still leaving a shortfall of over 110 billion yuan. Yesterday afternoon, this reporter visited Director Tian Yongqian of the Finance Bureau to inquire about the fiscal situation this month. According to him, the profit and loss situation will only become clear in mid-month, as the tax revenue situation will then be roughly known. However, the cost of living index for government employees has risen significantly this month, making it difficult to be optimistic about balancing revenue and expenditure. The authorities are currently engaged in an overhaul of tax revenue. The Finance Bureau has solicited reform opinions from its subordinate tax collection agencies, hoping to gather them all next week to discuss specific tax revenue reform measures.

### Two Defendants in Rice Ration Embezzlement Case: Found Guilty of Other Crimes and Sentenced

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Yizhong, leader of the Yong'an Rice Store's subsidized rice sales team, colluded with rice merchants Dai Yuanbi, Zang Fuyuan, Cai Zong, and Gu Baosong to engage in embezzlement. They were tried in local court yesterday. On May 29th of last year, the Yong'an Rice Store was entrusted by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to distribute rice to city residents. Xu Yizhong and others took advantage of their positions to deduct 3.5 liang of rice from each household. They then sold the deducted rice on the black market. Zhu Zhaomei, Shen Changfa, Ji Yimin, and three others reported them. During the trial in local court yesterday, Judge Wu Shaobai also discovered that Dai Yuanbi and Gu Baosong had been previously convicted of other crimes and sentenced to seven years in prison.

The trial concluded yesterday morning and is scheduled to resume on August 14th.

### Huangxing and Tongan Vessels in Anqing Send SOS

Anchor Chain Causes Trouble, Rescue Ship Dispatched

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Huangxing vessel, carrying salt from Qingdao to Anhui, arrived in Anqing on the 28th of last month. Due to a lack of space at the dock, it anchored on the opposite bank. The Tongan Company's Tongan vessel arrived in Anqing from Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 1st) and anchored in front of the Huangxing vessel. At that time, the river current was very swift, and the vessel was forced to retreat. Unexpectedly, the Tongan vessel's propeller entangled the Huangxing vessel's anchor chain. Upon seeing this, the Huangxing vessel's crew immediately cut the anchor chain and abandoned the anchor. It has now docked to unload cargo. However, the Tongan vessel's propeller is entangled in the anchor chain and cannot move. Both vessels sent telegrams yesterday requesting help. The Tongan Company requested that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatch a vessel to rescue them. The company decided to dispatch the Jian'an vessel this morning to Anqing for rescue.

### After Agreement on Wage Payment Method: China Silk Factory Number Two Suddenly Goes on Strike

[Report from Our Newspaper] The wages for workers at the city's state-run China Silk Company's First and Second Factories were previously paid on the 15th of each month and at the end of the month. However, after the authorities stipulated that the price index be announced twice a month, the company decided to change the wage payment schedule to the 20th of each month and the 5th of the following month, as calculating wages takes time. According to the methods stipulated by the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau, this was feasible. However, the labor union insisted that wages be paid two days earlier (i.e., the 3rd and 18th of each month) and that part of the wages be borrowed in the two periods of the 15th and 30th, and then deducted when wages were paid. After negotiations between labor and management, the following two points were decided: (1) The wages for the first half of each month will be paid in full on the 18th, based on the price index for the previous period of this month. (2) The wages for the second half of each month will be paid in full on the 4th of the following month, based on the price index for the next period of this month. After the method was agreed upon, the workers at the First Factory continued to work as usual, and their morale was quite good. However, the workers at the Second Factory suddenly went on strike yesterday morning. After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday sternly ordered the chairman of the Second Factory's labor union to persuade the workers to resume work by this morning.

### Three Suspects in Colluding with Bandits Case Indicted; Yao Changhai Acquitted and Released

Defendant He Yuzhen was a female worker at the Shanghai Xinshen Number Nine Factory. She joined the Communist Party organization and introduced Hua [missing character] Zhu, a female worker from the same factory, to join as well.

### Bogus Money Used to Defraud; Scheme Exposed

[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 4:00 PM yesterday, two customers, Cui Xinqi and Liu Xiaoquan, suddenly arrived at Bao Chengxiang Cotton Fabric Store at 20 Zizhong Road. They selected 20 bolts of cotton fabric, totaling 1.43 billion yuan in legal tender. They instructed the store clerk to deliver it to a room in the Xinli Hotel on South Xizang Road. The store owner, Kang Binjia, ordered his associate Xu Weimin to load the goods onto a vehicle and deliver them. After arriving, Cui ordered Liu to take care of the cotton fabric while he counted out a large sum of cash. After Xu carefully counted each bill, he discovered that the outer few bills were indeed legal tender, but the rest were all ghost money. Seeing that his scheme had been exposed, Cui turned to flee, but was stopped by Xu, who called the police. The police from the Songshan Police Station arrested him. After checking, only 43.7 million yuan in legal tender was found. The rest was all counterfeit money, it was said.

### Major Fire in Nanshi Lasting Three Hours: Hundreds of Shanties Destroyed; Four from Culprit Clothing Store Detained for Interrogation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Shanties densely packed together in the area in front of the Hunan Guild Hall at the intersection of Huminnan Road and Xietu Road in Nanshi, totaling over 400, were mostly inhabited by laborers from northern Jiangsu. At around 0:15 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the clothing store opened by Xu Chenglong, a native of northern Jiangsu, at 371 Lunan Road due to careless cooking of lunch. At that time, the weather was extremely hot, and the scorching sun was raging. Once the thatched sheds caught fire, black smoke billowed into the sky, and the flames were dazzling. In an instant, the fire spread to the neighboring Senji Tobacco and Paper Store at 369 and the Meili Barber Shop at 373. Before long, over a hundred shanties in the alley at 365 were reduced to ashes. Subsequently, the fire spread to the north side of the road, and over two hundred thatched sheds built in front of the Hunan Guild Hall were also completely burned to the ground. Fortunately, firefighters and police removed the thatched sheds attached to the base of the Hunan Guild Hall's wall; otherwise, the situation would have been even more dire. After the fire broke out, the Nanshi District Fire Brigades were the first to rush to the scene to put out the fire. Then, the Xin Kaihe Gaoshan Road Fire Zone and other teams also arrived at the scene with fire trucks. The fire was brought under control at 2:50 PM, but the embers were not completely extinguished until 3:30 PM. Hundreds of men and women affected by the disaster gathered by the roadside, their wives weeping and their children crying, in a most miserable state. The fire starter, Xu Chenglong, and three others were later detained by the Penglai Police Station for interrogation.

### Special Relief Donation Campaign Intensified: Du Yuesheng Donates 100 Billion as Example; Wealthy Tightwads to be Sanctioned

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Special Relief Donation Solicitation Committee held a meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu, who also serves as the committee chairman, presided over the meeting. Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiyu, Cheng Cangbo, Wang Xiaolai, Fang Zhi, Wu Yunchu, Shui Xiangyun, Shu Yuzhang, and more than a dozen others attended. During the meeting, it was decided that the object of continued solicitation would be wealthy individuals, and the amount of money already raised would not be made public for the time being. It is hoped that the target of over 8.5 trillion yuan can be exceeded. Currently, the Hangzhou branch in another city has pledged to donate 30 billion, and Wuxi has remitted over 8 billion. Other branches are actively urging donations. The Solicitation Committee expressed optimism about the future of the special donation campaign. However, it may take coercive action against wealthy individuals who deliberately delay donations. If necessary, it will take decisive measures, such as having the government investigate their property and temporarily hold it in custody until the donation is made. At the same time, their names will be published and subjected to public censure. Committee member Du Yuesheng immediately pledged to donate 100 billion yuan at yesterday's meeting as an example.

### Former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army to China, Japanese War Criminal Okamura Neiji, Indicted by Military Court; Accused of Conniving with Subordinates to Massacre Civilians During His Tenure

War criminal Okamura Neiji was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army to China in November of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944). All Japanese army combat troops in China were under his command and supervision. After the victory, he represented the Japanese government in handling matters such as surrender to China and the repatriation of prisoners of war. After the work was completed, the suspect suffered from severe tuberculosis. After receiving treatment and recovering slightly, he was handed over by the Ministry of National Defense to the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals for trial. He was recently escorted to Shanghai and is temporarily residing in a hospital for treatment. After a thorough investigation by Prosecutor Shi Yong of the court, it was determined that he was suspected of conniving with his subordinates to massacre civilians during his tenure. Therefore, he was indicted. The full text of the indictment is recorded below:

Defendant Okamura Neiji, male, 65 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army to China, Army General.

The aforementioned defendant's war crime case (Case No. 145 of the 37th year of the Republic of China) has been investigated and concluded, and it is determined that prosecution is warranted. The facts of the crime, evidence, and relevant legal provisions are described below:

(1) Facts

Defendant Okamura Neiji, from Tokyo, Japan, graduated from the Japanese Army Academy and the Army University. He successively served as the Chief of the Military Investigation Committee, a Major General; the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army; the Second Chief of the General Staff Headquarters; the Commander of the Second Division, a Lieutenant General; the Commander of the 11th Army; and the Commander of the 6th Area Army, an Army General. During the Sino-Japanese War, on November 26, 1944, the defendant was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army, and all land combat troops in China were under the command and supervision of the defendant. During his tenure, his subordinates frequently committed atrocities against our civilians, including killing, looting, and destruction of property. Cases that were serious and have been adjudicated include: (1) Ochiai Jin'nouro, Lieutenant General and Commander of the 27th Division, led his troops into Jiangxi Province in January 1945, disrupting Lianhua, Yongxin, Suichuan, Taihe, and other counties, killing 89 of our civilians, including Zhou Haoping, Feng Wangshi, and Wang Zhanming, and burning down 65 houses. (2) Kitanohara Shiro, Lieutenant General and Commander of the 116th Division, was stationed in Shaoyang, Hunan, from April to July 1945, and continuously massacred 110 civilians, including Fan Yuechi. (3) Oka Hisao, Major General and Commander of the 55th Brigade of the 64th Division, was stationed in Yongjia and Yueqing, Zhejiang. From January 1945 until the Japanese surrender, the brigade continuously robbed 84 businesses, including Zhang Dexun, Zhang Yaokun, Zhao Dianxiang, Xu Hongfang, and Yuanshengxiang Cloth Store, and set fire to dozens of houses and furniture and clothing belonging to Huang Xiuchang and ten other families. (4) Funabiki Masayuki, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Changsha Area Gendarmerie, was stationed in Changsha, Yuanjiang, and Xiangyin. From February to April 1945, the unit continuously killed 22 civilians, including Li Fuxian and Yang Zhengbao. (5) Tanaka Hisaichi, Lieutenant General and Commander of the 23rd Army, set fire to all the houses in Liuzhou when he withdrew his troops in 1945, causing an unprecedented catastrophe. After the end of the war, Okamura Neiji was turned over by the Ministry of National Defense to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.

(2) Evidence and Legal Provisions

According to Article 46 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, belligerents should respect the lives and private property of the people in occupied territories. In this case, the atrocities committed by the defendant's subordinates during combat operations or in garrison areas while he was Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army are well-documented. (Omission) The defendant held supreme military power and, with respect to the massacres, robberies, and destruction of property perpetrated by his subordinate troops, neither took preventative measures beforehand nor promptly stopped them afterward. According to Article 9 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations, he should be held jointly liable. Although he claimed that he always had strict military discipline and that he had severely prohibited any illegal behavior by his troops, these were nothing more than empty words and sophistry intended to evade criminal responsibility. He connived with his subordinates to continuously massacre civilians, loot, and wantonly destroy property during combat operations, thereby violating Articles 46 and 47 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and committing crimes under Article 2, Section 2, Article 3, Section 1, and Articles 24 and 27 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations. Therefore, he is prosecuted in accordance with Article 26 of the same regulations.

Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### Refused to Return the Property after Negotiating a Two-Year Extension After the Expiration of the Contract, Intending to Seize the Property

Reader Zhou Xiangfa asks: I have a house that was mortgaged to Ding in 1912, who then sub-mortgaged it to Chen. In 1935, I renewed the mortgage contract with Chen for a term of ten years. After the term expired in 1945, I intended to redeem the property for my own use, but Chen claimed that he had to wait for his nephew to return from Chongqing to handle the matter, and requested a two-year extension. Unexpectedly, when I went to redeem the property last year, he said that the deadline had passed and my right to redeem the property had expired. I would like to ask: (1) Is Chen's behavior illegal, and can I sue him for fraud? (2) If I can redeem the property, how many times the original price will be required?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers:] (1) If a mortgage has a fixed term, and after the term expires, the mortgagor requests a two-year extension from the mortgagee, there should be written proof, otherwise, if the property is not redeemed at the original mortgage price after two years, the mortgagee obtains ownership of the property. If you have no basis to claim back the property through legal means, it will be difficult to win the case, as there are no clear provisions in the law.

### Postal Q&A

We have received inquiries from the following readers of this newspaper: (1) Mr. Dong Dejia, (2) Mr. Tao Lixing, (3) Mr. Hu. We hereby answer the questions raised as follows:

Answer: (1) (A) All postal items deposited in the mailbox of the Shaanxi North Road branch office are opened and dispatched by the office on time, without delay or loss. Regarding the undelivered or unreturned letters you sent, please provide specific details for thorough investigation. (B) In the future, when inquiring about postal items, if you encounter the same situation, please inform the relevant postmaster for handling. (C) The postal agency at the intersection of Chengdu North Road and Siyang Road was repeatedly warned about raising the selling price of stamps but did not correct the behavior. This bureau has revoked its authorization and is seeking other merchants to take over.

(2) (A) An airmail letter from Shanghai to Chengde takes about four to five days to arrive. (B) The question is unclear. Please provide more details for investigation and reply.

(3) A telegraphic money order from the Xi'an Post Office takes 24 hours from the time it is sent by the telegraph office to the time it is received by this bureau, which is the normal situation. If there are disruptions in the electrical current or errors in the code words, it will take longer due to the need for repeated inquiries.

[Additional Note] Readers submitting letters should provide a detailed address for direct reply.

### The Import Control Committee Has Begun Accepting Applications for Importing Foreign Capital. Whether Hong Kong and Macau Are Applicable Is Still Under Negotiation.

Regarding the "Regulations for the Import of Overseas Chinese Capital and Foreign Capital," Huo Baoshu of the Import Control Committee stated yesterday that the committee has begun accepting applications from all parties. According to Mr. Huo, although the detailed implementation rules are still being discussed by the Executive Yuan, in order to accelerate the import of these materials, the committee has decided to accept applications from all parties first. If there are any questions, the committee can provide detailed explanations. Mr. Huo also stated that whether Hong Kong and Macau should be classified as foreign countries, i.e., whether the regulations are applicable to them, is currently being discussed with the Federation of Industries and other parties to seek their opinions.

Zhang Yaozhang, Secretary-General of the Importers and Exporters Association, said that it is unreasonable to treat Hong Kong and Macau's capital as special. Although Hong Kong and Macau are adjacent to the mainland, the import of goods can easily cause fluctuations in the foreign exchange market and encourage speculation, but if restrictions are added, the funds may still be remitted to Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, and still be imported as overseas Chinese capital. Therefore, the crux of the problem lies in comprehensive and strict management, rather than making Hong Kong and Macau special.

### The Market Is in a State of Confusion, with Chinese Stocks Rising and Falling Sharply

Chinese stocks rose and fell sharply yesterday. Wing On Textiles started with a 50 yuan increase on top of the limit-up price, once returning to over 2,000 yuan, but at noon, it was not far from the limit-down price. The news was conflicting, and the market was in a state of confusion, with many retail investors and those with excessive long positions being shaken out. Although the morning session carried over the momentum from Saturday afternoon, coupled with rumors of capital increases and large bills, the opening was generally positive. Wing On Textiles even opened high to the limit-up price of 13,860 yuan. However, with public utilities soaring to six times their value, there was some trepidation. Nos. 226 and 65 were sold at 13,700 yuan, and Nos. 76 and 4 were bought, repeatedly approaching the limit-up price and even exceeding it by 50 yuan. China Xing, Zhabei, Wing Yip, and China Match reached the limit-up price, but the actual sales of yarn and cloth were mediocre, and credit was tight. Nos. 224 and 164 were actively sold at high prices, falling to 13,080 yuan. Nos. 176 and 12 bought slightly at low prices, rising to 13,250 yuan. Unfavorable rumors circulated frequently, and many retail investors were forced to sell due to tight credit. Nos. 60 and 180 sold aggressively, falling to 11,950 yuan at the close. China Cement was the only one to reach the limit-up price. Compared with last Saturday, Wing On Textiles and China Match Zhabei had rebounded after reaching the limit-up price. The former declined slightly, while the latter still rose by half and one percent, respectively. China Xing, Lian Di, Wing Yip, and China Cement reached the limit-up price. China United and Everbright rose by half a percent, Jin Hing fell by one percent, and Mayar, Shanghai Cement, Jing Fu, New Kwong, Underwear, Jing Lun, China Hua Fung, and China National Goods rose by a small percentage. New China, Commercial Press, China Silk were flat, and the rise and fall of other stocks were minimal.

In the afternoon market, Wing On Textiles opened at 13,150 yuan. Nos. 169 and 225 bought at 12,750 yuan, but No. 129 and No. 89 sold, immediately dropping to 12,270 yuan. Thereafter, the price fluctuated erratically, seesawing around 12,500 yuan. Before the close, Nos. 218 and 216 bought at 12,850 yuan, and Nos. 185 and 99 re-emerged at high prices, returning slightly to 12,500 yuan. The national banks had an exchange surplus. Nos. 170 and 145 bought at 12,700 yuan, ending the session. Compared to the morning close, Wing On Textiles, Mayar, New Kwong, Jing Fu, China National Goods, China Hua Fung, and Underwear each rose by half a percent. Wing On Public Utilities and Zhabei declined slightly. Among the various unlisted stocks outside the market, China Communications, Ta Sheng, and China Hua Cheng performed well, with China Communications rising by a strong half a percent. Cultural stocks were generally flat but slightly weaker, and the remaining stocks were only stable.

Government Bonds

Yesterday, after an initial rise, government bonds retraced, with gains and losses being minimal, and trading volume was only 2 million. Series C opened at 1.2 million in the morning, with a high of 1.26 million, but the price could not be sustained and retreated to 1.16 million at the close. Compared with last Saturday, Series A, B, and E each rose by 20,000 yuan, Series C rose by 10,000 yuan, and Series D declined slightly by 20,000 yuan.

### Rumors of Gold Nationalization

Yu Hongjun Solemnly Denies

Bank Vault Employees Are Very Busy

President Yu Hongjun of the Central Bank solemnly denied yesterday the rumors circulating in the market that the government has decided to nationalize gold and freeze bank vaults. According to Mr. Yu, the government has no such plans, and people should not believe the rumors. However, people in Shanghai who hold gold and banknotes have been rushing to banks to deposit and withdraw them. From morning till night, the major banks with vaults were crowded. Vault employees were overwhelmed, but they were puzzled as to why customers suddenly moved together.

### Tianjin Central Bank Branch Officially Begins Auctioning Short-Term Treasury Bills (Two-Month Term)

### The 13th Rediscount and Loan Meeting Approved National Policy Loans

### 1,500 Tons of Taiwan Sugar Are Being Distributed Today

Cube Sugar Is Already Being Manufactured in Shanghai

The Taiwan Sugar Company continued to sell white refined sugar yesterday, slowing down the rise in sugar prices. White refined sugar vouchers for the 9th shipment were priced at 58.2 million for immediate delivery and 59.2 million for next-day delivery, a slight increase of 1 million. Only crude sugar was priced at 2.5 million higher, as it had not been distributed for several shipments.

The Shanghai office of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently leased the former British Taikoo Sugar Refinery site and all of its equipment, and began manufacturing cube sugar in large quantities last month. Currently, the daily output has reached around 4,000 pounds, most of which will be exported to compete in foreign markets and earn foreign exchange, in addition to supplying some local needs.

The tenth price distribution of Taiwan sugar will be handled starting from the 2nd. It is reported that the total amount distributed this time is about 1,500 tons.

### Keemun Tea Trading Is Quiet

When the tea market opened yesterday morning, British export firms offered prices for this year's Keemun black tea at only around 123 million per lot, which was still far from the asking price of 150 million from the sellers. The trading atmosphere remained gloomy. However, local shops and firms were still making small purchases to meet retail demand, so the process was not entirely desolate. As for other varieties, after the index rose steadily, the principals felt that the cost had increased, so their intention to raise prices became more intense, and the trend continued to accelerate. However, buyers were cautious about high prices and hesitated, so the prices quickly returned to a flat level. The closing results were similar to those of last week, with no significant fluctuations. The base price, however, was even more solid, and the prospects remained tight.

### Demand for Imported Pine Is Weak

In yesterday's timber market, the price of imported pine was raised due to the increase in exchange settlement certificates, but there were few transactions due to weak actual sales. The market for fir remained sluggish.

### Registered U.S. Dollar Savings Bonds

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Regarding the handling of cases where the endorsement on registered U.S. dollar savings bonds does not match the original registered seal, financial authorities explained that payment should be made only after a court confirmation and ruling. When making payment, the bondholder should also provide reliable insurance to ensure caution.

### China Trust Bureau Raises Funds to Purchase Salt for Barter Trade with Japan

[Our Report] It is reported that although barter trade between China and Japan continues, the trade volume is very small. China's main exports are bran, ramie, and bean cake, while Japan's main exports are surplus wood. Food was a major export item to Japan in previous China-Japan barter trade, but this year it could not be exported due to a lack of funds to purchase salt. The China Trust Bureau is raising funds by mortgaging Japanese woolens to finance the purchase of salt.

### Woolens Turn Strong from Flat

The woolen market turned strong again yesterday from flat, because domestic and foreign credit conditions had eased, interbank lending rates had fallen by more than half, and prices of rice, public utilities for land and water transport, and public utilities had risen sharply. China Textiles opened at a 5% increase, and buyers and sellers retreated to advance. However, there were still few transactions at the tea parties and among major wholesalers in the morning and afternoon. Most people are waiting to see whether China Textiles will change its price on Wednesday. Currently, a situation of mutual rejection has formed.

### Cotton Yarn Initially Rises Then Falls Back; 客帮 (Guest Merchants) Nearing Settlements, Frequently Reveal Unease and Weakness

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw tight credit within the industry, rapid stock declines, and cotton cloth prices dropping after an initial rise. Sentiment was uncertain and unsettled. Actual sales on this street were slow, while selling pressure within the market intensified.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially opened strong, up 60,000 to 70,000, but then news circulated that the yarn association would continue selling off stock. Six varieties, including Double Globe, were priced slightly lower than the previous weekend. The market had abundant capital, and those going long couldn't overcome the interest burden. Furthermore, bearish rumors arose, triggering sales. Confidence weakened further, eventually causing a decline to close at the 2 billion mark, down 50 million from the weekend. The shipping quote for tomorrow is also down 50 million.

21-count Double Horse yarn initially jumped 40,000 to 50,000, but supply soon exceeded demand, ultimately leading to a decline of 70 million. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also uniformly declined by 20 million to 100 million, with only 42 or 43 deals made.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened following the strong momentum of the weekend, with most people bullish. Tianjin merchants initially bought in, and traders and cloth merchants competed to drive prices up. 12-yard Dragon Head fine cloth soared all the way to an unprecedented high of 61 million, a rise of more than 4 million compared to the previous weekend.

However, after 10:30 AM, news of a stock market correction and tightening credit spread. Simultaneously, rumors emerged that the authorities would establish a special price control agency in the city to suppress speculation and hoarding. Merchants from the Yangtze River region, facing difficulties in remitting funds, started selling off stock. Tianjin and Sichuan merchants also released large quantities, using rumors to facilitate sales and secretly unloading inventory. Confidence suddenly weakened, creating a situation of supply exceeding demand, and the market declined sharply. The price ultimately settled at 57.5 million, down 2.5 million from the weekend. Prices outside the exchange fell by more than 10%. Other cloth markets saw mixed ups and downs, but fluctuations were generally stable. A total of 1,800 bolts were traded.

Furthermore, it is reported that the Dragon Head fine cloth sold by 紡建 (Fangjian) Company last weekend was priced at 56.7 million, second-grade Yuan Bi Ji at 51.1 million, and Si Jun Zi bleached cloth at 57.5 million, with few subscribers.

### Tense and Exciting 800m Final; Gold and Silver Medalists Both Set New Records; American Whitfield's Time is 1 Minute 49.2 Seconds; Belgian Athlete Wins 5000m Final

[Report by this newspaper] London, 2nd broadcast: The tense atmosphere of the Olympic 100m final was relived today in the men's 800m final. In fact, the tension and achievement of the 800m even surpassed the 100m. Both the first-place winner, Whitfield of Iowa University, and the second-place winner, Winter of Jamaica, broke the Olympic record of 1 minute 49.8 seconds set by the British runner Hampson in Los Angeles in 1932. The third-place winner, Hanson of France, also tied the Olympic record. The gaps between the three were only a few inches. The 82,000 spectators in the grandstands could not determine who would win, but cheered enthusiastically. When Whitfield's name was displayed on the record board and the Stars and Stripes flew on the flagpole, American spectators erupted in cheers for the sixth gold medal. Some spectators pounded their chests and stomped their feet, regretting that the black Winter and Hanson lost by only three-tenths of a second. The difference between fourth and fifth place was only four-tenths of a second, showing the intense competition. The results of the top six finishers in this edition were all better than the record of the champion of the previous 800m. The results of the top six were as follows:

### Olympic Football Tournament, First Week Results: England, France, Denmark, and Yugoslavia Advance to the Quarterfinals

[Report by this newspaper] London, 1st broadcast: The first week of the football tournament was characterized by extremely fierce competition. In four matches, only Yugoslavia's match against Luxembourg was easy, while the remaining matches, England vs. Netherlands and Denmark vs. Egypt, were decided after extra time. France's 2-1 victory over India was also highly entertaining. Yugoslavia, England, Denmark, and France secured the right to advance to the quarterfinals.

(1) In the England vs. Netherlands match, the Dutch opened the scoring early through center-forward Abel. After 20 minutes, the English team equalized. In the second half, the English team fought hard and scored again. However, after five minutes, Abel equalized again, forcing a 2-2 tie. In the final ten minutes, England scored again, taking the lead for the second time, but in the blink of an eye, the Dutch team, attacking in full force, equalized. In extra time, England's McIlvenny scored, and the English team defended with all their might, managing to hold on in the face of a relentless Dutch onslaught until the end of the match, winning 4-3.

(2) Denmark and Egypt were evenly matched, making the match extremely tense. There were no goals in the first half. In the second half, Denmark scored first, but Egypt equalized within a minute. Until the end of the match, neither side could score again. After the game went to extra time, Egypt's relentless attacks were unsuccessful, and Denmark took advantage, scoring again in the first half. Nearing the end of the match, Denmark added another goal through a penalty kick, eliminating Egypt 3-1.

(3) Both France and India excel at short passes, so the match was characterized by delicate and fast-paced tactics, without the sweeping, organized attacks. France took the lead with a goal in the first half. Not long after the start of the second half, India missed a penalty kick. After 25 minutes, the Indian team was compensated, forcing a tie. But France scored a long-range shot in the final moments, leaving India with regrets.

(4) Yugoslavia and Luxembourg were mismatched in strength, resulting in a one-sided match. Yugoslavia won easily by a score of 6-1 without exerting much effort.

### Blacks Excel at Sprints, Delat's Explanation: Tropical Environments Are Suitable for Sprinting

[Associated Press, London, August 1st] Delat, the black track and field athlete who tied the Olympic record for the 100m in this edition of the Games, said today that African Americans are particularly good at sprints because they have short bursts of speed but lack the endurance for long-distance running. He continued, "In reality, the only difference between blacks and whites is skin color. I do not believe in any mysterious explanations, such as black people having better muscle structure, or that we are closer to 'nature' than whites. I believe that blacks excel at sprints because most of them live in tropical areas and have environmental conditions suitable for sprinting." He pointed out, "Even white athletes cannot run a five-mile race in ninety-degree heat. In terms of physical strength, there is really no difference between whites and blacks. Although many blacks are known for their sprinting abilities, it is not surprising."

### Li Shiqiao Has Not Yet Arrived, Our Delegation's Life is Monotonous, Chinese Chefs Provide Delicious Meals

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] Our Olympic delegation has been living at the Keelpat Vocational School for a week now. Because the school's facilities are not as good as those at the Oaksbridge Olympic Center, entertainment options and sports equipment are lacking, causing the athletes to feel bored and disappointed. They have complained about the monotony of their lives and often have nothing to do except for competition days. Since moving to the Keel school, our delegation has lost the opportunity to observe athletes from other countries practicing at Oaksbridge, especially missing the chance to see the latest training methods adopted by the American delegation. However, a major advantage of the new accommodation is that there are many Chinese chefs, providing delicious meals. Oaksbridge only offered Western food, accompanied by cold meats and vegetables. Some athletes have occasionally gone to nearby Keel to enjoy the foreign scenery. Most find it difficult to go out due to language barriers, so they stay in their rooms, playing cards and having fun. Most amusingly, the officials of the delegation, whose rooms are on the fifth floor, have to go up and down several times a day, complaining of excessive exercise and muscle stiffness, as the Keel school does not have an elevator. Many of the officials participated in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and enjoy talking about the scale and facilities of that event. However, the track and field athletes remain very enthusiastic. Although Lou Wenfang and Huang Liangzheng failed to win medals in the competition on the 30th, they were not discouraged or resentful and gained valuable experience. In particular, Lou Wenao, despite having blisters on both feet, finished the entire race, and his courage was highly praised by his teammates. The basketball team lost its first match, but morale is high. Those who unfortunately injured their feet during the match with Chile have now recovered. They are all eager to win their first victory in the match against Belgium at Harringay tonight. It is still uncertain whether forward Li Shiqiao will arrive in time to participate.

### 10,000 Meter Final - Dispute Over Rankings - Someone Ran One Lap Short - Norway Protests Thus

[Associated Press London, August 1st] Scandinavian track and field officials are indignant about the misclassification of many athletes in last Friday's 10,000-meter final, calling it "a rare and enormous disgrace in international competition."

Norwegian track and field team leader Noren stated: Track and field officials miscounted the number of laps the athletes should run, resulting in at least twelve people running one lap short. Noren stated: Norwegian athlete Kjeldson was officially listed as eighteenth. If the track and field officials had not miscounted one lap after twenty laps, Kjeldson should have been eighth or ninth.

Noren stated: Kjeldson noticed the officials' mistake and automatically completed the entire course, but other athletes, including Belgium's Efra and the Netherlands' Latoste, ran one lap short.

Noren personally felt the most distressed about Stogen and Sweden's Denhoff, who were officially listed as fifth and sixth. Although track and field officials from Sweden and Norway protested, their rankings were ultimately not changed.

Noren stated: Denhoff claimed that he was the fifth person to complete the entire course after Stogen. He said: "After the race, we protested to the track and field director Hulte, and Hulte promised to correct it. By Saturday, the official record still had not been changed. Now the authorities say that this matter will be resolved after the games are over."

### Ministry Order for Provinces and Cities to Submit - Education and Culture Expenditure Estimates - Carefully Calculating to Meet Constitutional Requirements

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, August 2nd] The Ministry of Education issued two orders to the Education Bureaus of various provinces and cities, stating: It has been found that the "Education and Culture Expenditure" budgets compiled by various provinces, cities, and counties in the past years often lack legal standards.

Now that constitutional governance has begun, the standards for budgeting and expending education and culture expenditures at all levels have been clearly stipulated in Article 164 of the Constitution. Subsequently, when compiling full-year or half-year estimates, various provinces, cities, and counties should reasonably allocate the "Education and Culture Expenditure" items to meet the constitutional requirements. Careful calculations must be made. Whether the estimated budget for the second half of this year has been compiled by the province or city should be promptly submitted to the Ministry for review and approval. Compliance is required.

### Reminiscence

— Zhao Qingge

When Aihua left me, I cried! Now that Dong Zi'ang has left me, I cry again!

They are both my so-called servants, but they are also my friends.

I envy people who often change an employee every three days or every two days. Although ordinary people find this painful, it is better than the feeling of sadness that I inevitably feel every time I spend a long time with an employee and then separate.

Aihua and Dong Zi'ang, both unwilling to continue this way, went their separate ways. Aihua told me before she left: She would rather starve to death than be a slave after leaving me. Except for serving me, she would never serve anyone else in this world, because no one would respect her like I did, treating her as a friend. So I sympathized with her ambition and let her go. Now she works in a textile factory. She came to see me the day before yesterday, and I was relieved that her life was secure and that she had finally learned a skill.

After Aihua left, Dong Zi'ang came. He was a young and strong northern lad who had fought in the war. He served as a soldier with a relative. Two years ago, the relative transferred him to me because he could make pasta, which helped prevent my stomach problems from recurring for two years. Friends often advised me that it was inconvenient to use boys. But I alone did not think so. I myself have a boyish personality, and I do not have the habits of ordinary young ladies. I do the trivial things myself, my clothes are washed by the old woman next door, and he only cooks for me and runs errands. But he has an aspiring heart. He chose a profession that he liked: the automobile industry. He hopes to be a driver in the future. He said:

"I'll go learn first, and come back after I learn it. I'll cook for you at the same time, and when you have a car, I'll also be your driver."

"I won't have a car," I laughed.

"You can't be poor your whole life," he said confidently.

This reminded me that last year, after I published an article in the Dongfang magazine called "Peach and Plum Autumn Wind," which commemorated my fall to being a rickshaw student, a reader who was learning to drive a car in Hangzhou saw it. He was moved and wrote me a letter, saying that after he graduated, he would come and be my driver. I told him I wasn't in the car class. He also said that he would wait until I had a car. Now Dong Zi'ang is saying the same thing, and I think to myself: The car is still a shadow, but two drivers have been booked, which makes me both cry and laugh.

To fulfill Dong Zi'ang's wish, I asked a friend to introduce him to the Suzhou Ziqi Training Group to learn how to drive a car. Before he left, he said goodbye to me. He tearfully urged me to take care of myself and drink less alcohol. I nodded frequently to accept his kindness. When I sent him to the stairwell, my eyes blurred! Returning to the study, I thought that if there were no feelings between people, there would be less trouble! But I am the most emotional person.

Before the War of Resistance, I used a male servant who still sends me letters. I constantly remit money to help him. He is now in Henan, waiting for the train to pass, and he wants to find me again to serve me. He is the most loyal person. I remember once when I was sick, he secretly boiled an extra bowl of my medicine. He knelt in the yard and prayed to heaven for me, and then he drank the bowl of medicine. His foolish sincerity can be imagined.

Aihua and Dong Zi'ang are also very loyal people. They understand my life, understand my personality, and Aihua never asked me to increase her salary. I automatically increased it, and she always declined for a long time. As long as Dong Zi'ang saw that I ate half a steamed bun less for a meal, he would seriously frown. If I ate one more steamed bun for a meal, he would also be seriously happy. All of this made me sincerely moved and sincerely comforted.

Why are they so kind to me? Is it my good fortune because I happened to meet good people? No, I believe that there are no absolutely bad people in the world, it just depends on how you treat them. You give him one point of affection, and he will give you one point of loyalty! You love him, and he will not hate you for no reason.

My friends often laugh at me for treating servants too democratically. For example, if they accidentally did something wrong, I would find reasons to forgive them. I never interfered with them going out to play after work, and I also tried to find free movies for them to watch. Sometimes I even entertained with them. I sat in the room, and they could also sit on the side and talk to me. (This is absolutely intolerable to others.) Every New Year and holidays, they toasted me, and I toasted them back. In short, we are equal and classless. Why not? They and I are the same people; have the same independent personality; they only sell their labor to help me with what I cannot do and make a living because they are poorer than me, just as I have to sell my mental effort to write articles for a living. Therefore, I have no reason not to respect them. My publisher has no reason not to respect me. This mood has been cultivated since I was a child. When I was a child, I made friends with the little maids. I never had a master-servant concept. I have never regarded them as slaves, because everyone has a slave component, and everyone has a higher and greater authority above them. Therefore, even if you treat them as slaves, someone will treat you as a slave, and at the same time, they are also authorities, at least their children are their slaves.

But is my temper really good? No! I will also get angry once or twice a year. When I get angry, it's like thunder, it's over in one flash. I don't like nagging, and I never bear grudges in my heart. However, this kind of anger is not necessarily directed at my servants. Perhaps I have more opportunities to be angry at those authorities.

However, I did get angry at Aihua and Dong Zi'ang. Although I had reason to be angry at the time, now that I think about it, I regret it. I once made their hearts feel oppressed! Why didn't I control it?

Now, Aihua and Dong Zi'ang have left one after another. What they have left me is a memory of benevolence and righteousness; what should I give back to them? It is the passion of full reminiscence!

Wiping away the tears from the corners of my eyes, I silently wish Aihua and Dong Zi'ang well!

### "Noble" Music

— You Ting

At this time and in this country, art and life seem to be disconnected and are trending towards extremes.

Taking the more numerous middle class (i.e., those who live on salaries) as an example, if they are hungry for pianos, records, radios, and concert tickets in addition to making a living from their jobs, they will inevitably be ridiculed by the ruthless reality as "affected," or, in a new way of writing: "Learning from the bourgeoisie!"

For example, the piano, the basic instrument of music. No matter what you learn, you must study the piano. Therefore, either don't talk about music, or there must be a piano next to you. Even for "appreciation" alone, you cannot be outside of this, because the keyboard contains endless musical knowledge; as is the habit in civilized countries, it is even more so: "There should be a piano where there are children."

However, in China, pianos are mostly displayed in piano shops in Shanghai, with asking prices of more than 2 billion; others are decorated in the corners of wealthy people's living rooms, with beautiful flowers and plaster statues on top, and the piano covers are locked all year round; others are forced into singing and dancing halls, roaring with music that is unrecognizable day and night. But music academies are experiencing a piano shortage.

Then, of course, the piano is out of reach for ordinary people; from this, it seems that only the bourgeoisie can truly attack and practice music, but there are exceptions: In China, the sons of wealthy families who have a Grand Piano at home may not really understand the magic of music. Many of them use it to embellish luxury. If they were truly crazy about art for generations, they would never be able to afford a large piano at home today; on the contrary, "poor public school teachers, ordinary professional youths, and impoverished students are mostly truly immersed in art. Occasionally, a piano concerto heard from a radio on the side of the road will make them stop, and occasionally passing by a piano shop, they will stare at the instrument. However, reality draws a gap between these people and music.

Of course, there are also many professional young people who may save money to rent a piano to study, but one year after the victory, the piano rent was only about 60,000 yuan per month, and in the past six months, the piano rent for old tenants has increased by more than 100% per month, and the monthly rent in July was already 15 million yuan (for a very old piano). New piano rentals are priced at 25 million to 30 million. The increase in piano rent has exceeded the cost of living index. In the future, many piano renters will probably bid farewell to the piano with tears. Music is, after all, unrelated to "ordinary people."

However, the most important thing is that these professional young people's admiration for music is not due to the hope of becoming famous or being applauded on stage; they know that to achieve success in learning music, one must specialize in it from an early age, and in addition to long-term hard work, one must also have innate talent. There is no miracle of anyone becoming a "master" in one fell swoop. Many amateur music learners today only start learning at a very late "musical age." Knowing that even if they spend ten or twenty years from now on, no "miracle" can be discovered, but due to a strong love, or due to personal encounters, due to the depression of the times, they deeply feel that only music can provide comfort, so they pursue music as if they are starving and thirsty. However, the times hang music high up, not allowing ordinary people to approach it!

### Pinghu Watermelon

— Sheng Wu

Watermelon is a refreshing summer delicacy, and among the watermelon markets in Shanghai, our Pinghu watermelon occupies the top spot. To be fair, Pinghu watermelon does have its own characteristics. It does not have the sour taste of Jiaxing Xinfeng produce, nor is it as bland as Jiashan watermelon, nor is the flesh of Haining watermelon as crisp. Pinghu watermelon is indeed "crisp and sweet," suitable for taste, and has few seeds, which are black, bright, and shiny.

Merchants who specialize in watermelon start going to the countryside around the end of the fifth lunar month to put stamps on the melons that are growing in the fields and have not yet fully ripened. Everyone has their own mark, indicating that these melons have been "betrothed" by someone. People who did watermelon business last year mostly made money, but farmers were complaining because many people were deceived by merchants, who delayed payment, resulting in extremely large losses. Therefore, this year they were smarter, Shanghai and Pinghu are very close, so the farmers prepared to "grow," "transport," and "sell" themselves. Every household planted from one or two acres to more than ten acres. The quantity can be at the very beginning, if the rainfall is even, the estimated production is more than 10,000. Pinghu may become a "watermelon mountain" or a "watermelon sea." However—heaven does not follow people's will, and several days of continuous rain rotted more than 60% of the watermelon roots. When the melons were developing, they were hit by raindrops and became "pitted" melons, which are difficult to sell and easily rot, and the flesh also changed flavor. As a result, only about 20% of the melons could be exported, which is less than one-third of the previous year's production.

The price of watermelons in Shanghai the previous week was only 3 million per load, but these days it has risen to the 10 million mark. There are fewer people in Shanghai who eat watermelons after the Beginning of Autumn. Now there are only six or seven days left before the Beginning of Autumn festival, and the last few days have been particularly hot, so Pinghu watermelons in Shanghai are in the golden age. And those watermelon merchants, who Pinghu people call "watermelon young masters," must also be more active these days.

The origin of Pinghu watermelons covers the entire county, with the area around Tingzi Bridge outside the South Gate being the best. About 800,000 to 900,000 watermelons can be transported to Shanghai this year. The good watermelons have all gone to Shanghai, and we Pinghu people rarely get to eat good watermelons!

### American Tidbits

— Xian Si

According to the American Korean Weekly, the US Army and Navy authorities have selected 200 young officers and asked them to learn Russian.

Former American Presidents Coolidge, Hoover, and Roosevelt rarely ate out. Truman, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. He especially likes to accept invitations from old friends for casual chats.

Eisenhower's main pastime is playing bridge, and he is quite skilled. Douglas (Democrat), a Justice of the US Supreme Court who was once rumored to be running for Vice President, likes to collect autographs of celebrities. He has already collected the autographs of every US President.

The Democratic Party in the United States is experiencing extreme economic panic. Donations are scarce, and income is insufficient. New York State, California, and Texas used to donate a lot of money to Roosevelt's election campaign, but this time they are standing by and watching Truman.

### Naked Prime Minister

— Nan Wu

Half a month after the Pearl Harbor incident broke out, Churchill led the highest-ranking generals of the British General Staff to the United States.

The British Prime Minister became a guest of the White House. He lived in the guest room upstairs in the Presidential Palace, opposite the room of Hopkins, Roosevelt's number one favorite. The upstairs of the White House was originally very quiet, and rarely did anyone walk around, but at this time it became the headquarters of the British Empire, with civil and military officials carrying briefcases coming and going constantly. The White House's dishes were also more abundant than usual, and fine wines often appeared, of course.

According to Hopkins, one day President Roosevelt sat in a wheelchair and went to the Prime Minister's room. Unexpectedly, Churchill jumped out of the bathroom completely naked! I saw that this old man had just taken a bath, and he was not wearing a thread, and he was rubbed red. Roosevelt was shocked and apologized repeatedly. Churchill, however, didn't care and declared that it didn't matter. He said nicely: "The Prime Minister of Great Britain does not need to hide anything from the President of the United States."

Hewitt, another Roosevelt brain trust (he was a famous playwright, and he was the one who wrote many of Roosevelt's speeches), went to ask Churchill if this was reliable. Churchill hurriedly said, "Completely nonsense." He said that at least he always had a towel around his waist when he saw the president. Then, Churchill said slyly, "Would I say anything to the President that doesn't need to be concealed? Even if I said it, the President wouldn't believe it!" (Excerpted and translated from Hewitt's "Hopkins Secret Records")

### Also a Record of Wu Qingyuan

— Yi Yun

This newspaper published Yu Shoujun’s record of Wu Qingyuan's affairs at the Japanese Go Institute. The account is extremely detailed. Wu is the premier Go player of our time, young and strong, with limitless potential. In the past, in our country, he couldn’t even support himself, and was thus recruited by the Japanese. It is truly lamentable.

I recall around 1923 or 1924, Wu already had a great reputation. He and his brother often played Go at Chunming Hall in Zhongshan Park. Those who played against him were invariably defeated. At the time, Duan Zhirui was in power in Beijing, and he provided a monthly stipend to support Wu’s playing and studying Go. Later, when Duan stepped down, Wu became despondent in Beijing, with no opportunities. In 1927, Cao Rulin arrived in Beijing from Japan, accompanied by a certain Japanese 6-dan master (I have forgotten his name, perhaps it was the 7-dan Yasui Kensaku mentioned by Yu Shoujun). He invited those in Beijing skilled in Go to compete. At the time, the veteran players were afraid to accept the challenge, so they suggested Wu and scheduled a match. The idea was that Wu was young, so even if he lost, it wouldn’t matter, but if he won, it would be a great source of pride. It was a trick reminiscent of the Tang Dynasty sending against the Korean Prince.

Cao booked the entire Qingyun Pavilion teahouse outside Qianmen, using it as the Go playing venue. He advertised the event in the newspaper to gather enthusiasts. About two hundred people unexpectedly gathered that evening, crowding the entire floor, a remarkable scene. Wu, playing black, played against the Japanese player in a small room inside the teahouse. Four large tables were set up outside the room, each with a Go board. Two people were assigned to each table. Every time a piece was played inside, a person would announce it loudly, and the four tables outside would duplicate the move. The crowd watched and quietly commented. Wu played his moves very quickly, while the Japanese player played more and more slowly. Wu was thin and young, seemingly too weak to wear his clothes. The Japanese player was in his thirties, robust and sturdy, sitting like a mountain. Everyone feared Wu would be defeated and rooted for him, hoping Wu would make a winning move with each announcement. Later, the game became more and more intense, and the crowd became increasingly nervous, gradually reaching a critical point. At the time, Wu’s moves seemed to be taking the lead, promising a victory. Unexpectedly, the Japanese player made a move, and the audience gasped, believing that this brilliant move was enough to reverse the decline, and the outcome was uncertain. Then Wu responded with a move, and the audience was greatly relieved again, praising it as a divine move, believing that the Japanese player's previous move was powerless. After a long time, the Japanese player made another move, and the crowd became anxious, saying that this move was very powerful, capable of turning a losing game into a Ko fight. How the Ko fight would unfold was anyone's guess. Then Wu responded with another move, and the crowd was greatly relieved, saying that the Ko fight was no longer possible, and victory was assured. Whispers of praise arose from all around. Afterwards, a long time passed again, but the Japanese player still didn't play a move. The time had reached past 11 o'clock. The spokesperson inside the room then announced to the crowd: "It is late at night, and there is not enough time to finish the game. We will now draw a diagram of the current state of the game and schedule a later date to complete it. We will still advertise it in the newspaper for everyone to watch." After several days, the newspaper finally published the news, stating that the Japanese player had admitted defeat and would not complete the game. During the game, both sides were completely focused. The Japanese player held his arms, staring at the Go board. It took a long time before he would play a move. Wu responded very quickly, but on his thin, pale face, the veins were already showing. He had no time to eat the tea snacks and fruit that were brought to him. The most amusing thing was that the people outside were very crowded. Wu was small, seemingly afraid to go out. When he needed to urinate, the teahouse attendant had to carry him outside and then carry him back inside. Today, recalling those old days, it is still vividly clear in my mind.
