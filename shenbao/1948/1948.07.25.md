### The Legislative Yuan's First Session Concludes; Reconvenes in September; Executive Yuan to Periodically Announce the General Budget

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The first session of the First Legislative Yuan formally concluded on the 24th, commencing recess from the 25th. The 22nd meeting, being the final session of the first term, addressed numerous crucial matters throughout the 24th, concluding amidst applause. President Sun, before adjourning, delivered a brief address, reviewing the session's work, stating approximately: "At the beginning of constitutional governance, the Legislative Yuan's extensive scale, coupled with the inexperience of colleagues and staff, initially caused a sense of disarray. However, with the formal establishment of each committee and the commencement of proposal review, the Yuan's affairs gradually normalized, which is gratifying. Particularly noteworthy is the efficiency and achievements of the Budget Committee in handling the general budget over the past two weeks, deserving commendation and admiration from colleagues." He then reported on the progress of facilities for the Legislative Yuan's offices and the residences of legislators, expressing hope that these issues would be gradually resolved within six months. He concluded by stating: "It is a great honor to work alongside colleagues to initiate this new era of constitutional governance. I sincerely hope that the nation's situation will steadily improve, thereby enhancing the Legislative Yuan's achievements even further." The Legislative Yuan also passed a provisional motion during the meeting on the 24th, resolving that the next session will convene anew in September, as stipulated by the Constitution, without delay. During the recess period, the work of each committee, under the direction of Committee Member Tian Liujing, will continue as usual. The pending cases, including the unresolved portions of the general budget, will continue to be reviewed.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The review report on the National General Budget for the second half of the 37th year, passed by the Legislative Yuan, is being expedited by the Budget Committee, with the expectation that it will be conveyed to the Executive Yuan on the 26th. The Executive Yuan will determine the announcement of the general budget thereafter. The Legislative Yuan also passed a provisional motion from the Procedure Committee during the meeting on the 24th, stating that the organizational laws, regulations, or ordinances of various government agencies whose budgets have been eliminated and are slated for abolishment, such as the National Economy Committee, the Flower Management Committee, the Fuel Management Committee, and the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, should be simultaneously declared abolished when the review report on the National General Budget is conveyed to the Executive Yuan.

### The 22nd Session of the Legislative Yuan Passes; Investigation Bureau Subordinated to Ministry of Interior; Heated Debate Ensued Before Vote

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The 22nd meeting of the First Legislative Yuan session was held on the 24th, chaired by Sun Ke. The meeting commenced at 9:30 AM, initially proceeding with report items. Following the adoption of the minutes of the 20th and 21st meetings, it was resolved to assign three draft laws submitted by the Executive Yuan to committees for review. These included: (1) the draft organizational law of the National Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, and the draft organizational regulations of the various regional National Taxation Bureaus, National Tax Collection Bureaus, Directly-Administered Direct Taxation Bureaus, and Directly-Administered Commodity Tax Bureaus under the Ministry of Finance; (2) the draft organizational regulations of the National Policy Advisor Committee and the Strategic Advisor Committee of the Presidential Office; and (3) the draft organizational law of the Ministry of National Defense. Subsequently, President Sun reported that the provisional regulations regarding the salaries and public expenses of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members, drafted by the Yuan's Legal System Committee, had been passed at the secret meeting on the 23rd and had been instructed to the Secretariat to prepare the budget accordingly. Discussion items began promptly at 10:00 AM. The first item was the Legal System Committee's review report on the draft organizational regulations of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The second item was a proposal by Shen Chongyu and 169 others, offering amendments to the aforementioned proposal, advocating for the Investigation Bureau to be subordinated to the Ministry of Interior. Both items were discussed concurrently. Following explanations by Zhang Jinjian, the convener of the Legal System Committee, and Shen Chongyu, the proposer of the amendment, a heated debate ensued. Those supporting the original proposal argued that establishing a body to safeguard national and social security within the judicial system would be a progressive step, emphasizing the bureau's future role in legal and technical aspects, with investigative powers but no authority to take action. Opponents argued that China already had an abundance of such institutions, yet the communist bandits continued to run rampant, casting doubt on their effectiveness. They contended that the judicial system should be open and impartial, and the Legislative Yuan should not hastily conflate the two, which could lead to adverse consequences. Some committee members advocated for retaining the original proposal, while the majority expressed that a compromise could be reached for political reasons, but they would never allow subordination to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. After more than an hour of debate, the meeting took a break and then proceeded to a vote. Initially, a vote was held on the suggestion to retain the original proposal. Out of 243 committee members present, 112 were in favor. Committee members opposing the original proposal then requested a counter-vote. The result of the counter-vote was 134 in favor out of 247 committee members present, and the suggestion to retain the original proposal was again rejected. However, the committee members opposing the original proposal remained dissatisfied, raising questions about the vote count and requesting a revote. Those opposing the counter-vote argued that such a vote was illegal. Simultaneously, some advocated for a division of seats for voting, while others advocated for a secret ballot. The entire venue was thrown into chaos for a time. At this juncture, Jiang Yiping raised a procedural issue, arguing that there were three views on the original proposal: retention, amendment, and upholding. By law, each should be voted on in turn, and the process should not be hindered by the repeated insistence of a minority on one view. President Sun also angrily exclaimed: "Please, everyone, pay attention to order! You have your own seats but you don't sit in them, instead scattering in the back rows, and then claim the count is wrong! You should all sit properly in the front rows before voting again." The committee members then returned to their original seats and, amidst a tense atmosphere, recounted the numbers and revoted on the three views in turn. The result was that out of 314 committee members present, 113 were in favor of retaining the original proposal, while 170 were in favor of the amendment by Shen Chongyu and others. Consequently, it was resolved to subordinate the Investigation Bureau to the Ministry of Interior. The original proposal and the amendment were jointly referred to the Legal System Committee and the Interior and Local Autonomy Committee for re-examination and revision of the draft organizational regulations. The uproar subsided, and adjournment for lunch was announced at about 12:00 PM.

### Regulations for Punishing Corruption: One-Year Term for Directors

The meeting resumed at 3:45 PM, smoothly processing several cases. (1) The National Defense Committee reported on the review of the President's submission for retroactive recognition of martial law declared in Guangyuan, resolving to grant retroactive recognition in accordance with the review comments. (2) The Legal System Committee reported on the review of the draft organizational regulations for the various committees of the Control Yuan, resolving to pass it as amended by the review amendment. (3) The Legal System Committee reported on the review of the draft organizational regulations for the Inspection Commissioner's Offices of the Control Yuan, resolving to pass it as amended by the review amendment. (4) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Water Conservancy Committee, jointly with the Legal System Committee, reported on the review of the revised articles of the organizational law of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, resolving to pass it in accordance with the review comments. (5) The Criminal Law Committee reported on the review of the extension of the implementation period of the regulations for punishing corruption by one year, resolving to pass it in accordance with the review comments. (6) The Criminal Law Committee reported on the amendment of Articles 1, 2, and 3 of the regulations raising the standards for fines and penalties, resolving to pass it in accordance with the review comments. (7) The Committee for Investigating the Leakage of Information from Secret Meetings reported on the investigation process and its decisions, resolving to pass its decision measures.

### Provisional Property Tax Case: Discussed in the Next Session

(8) The Foreign Affairs Committee, jointly with the Finance and Banking Committee, reported on the review of the amended contract for the Sino-American Railway Loan and Coal Mining Loan, resolving to pass it in accordance with the review comments. (9) The Legal System Committee reported on the review of the draft general rules for the operation of the Yuan's various committees, resolving to pass it as amended by the review amendment. (10) The Finance and Banking Committee reported on the review of the case for levying a provisional property tax, resolving to return it to the Finance and Banking Committee to study the draft implementation regulations and submit them to the Yuan meeting for discussion together with the draft provisional property tax regulations in the next session. The meeting adjourned at 6:45 PM.

### KMT Members of Legislative and Supervisory Yuans: The Director-General Will Convene Talks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] It is reported that Chiang, the Director-General of the KMT, will soon invite KMT members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans for talks.

[Another dispatch] As the Legislative Yuan will be in recess from the 25th, and the Supervisory Yuan will also be in recess in the coming days, the Central Committee of the KMT plans to convene a symposium within two or three days, inviting party members among the legislative and supervisory members to exchange opinions on reforming party affairs.

### Leakage of Secret Meeting Information: The Legislative Yuan Passes the Investigation Committee's Report

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Legislative Yuan passed the investigation report submitted by the Yuan's Committee for Investigating the Leakage of Information from Secret Meetings, as well as the decision that the leakage and publication of secret information were due to the absence of sanctions for more than a decade, which had become customary. Now that the Yuan had investigated and handled the matter seriously, and various newspapers had cooperated fully, it would be inappropriate to impose significant responsibility abruptly. Moreover, the responsibility of the leaker was far greater than that of the interviewer and publisher. If the leaker could not be identified, the publisher could not bear sole responsibility. The following four decisions were recorded: (1) A list of newspapers that published secret financial, monetary, diplomatic, and military information related to the Yuan will be sent to the Executive Yuan for appropriate handling. (2) The committee members of this Yuan who also hold positions at newspapers are requested to inform their respective newspapers to cooperate fully with this Yuan in the future and effectively prevent the leakage of secret information. (3) In addition to issuing special entry and exit passes, a personal photograph will be attached to the passes for all personnel attending secret meetings. (4) The Legal System Committee is requested to formulate rules and penalties for adherence to secret meetings, based on the principles resolved at the International Press Conference, to serve as guidelines.

### Gathering of Generals in the Old Capital: Military Conference to be Held

Senior military generals such as Lin Weichou, Hou Jingru, Zheng Tingfeng, and Yuan Pu have already arrived in Beiping, and Shi Jue is scheduled to fly from Chengde to Beiping on the 25th. (Battlefront news of bandit suppression is published on page two.)

### President Weng Broadcasts to Domestic and International Audiences: Explaining the Necessity of Unity and Mobilization; Must Gather Strength to Suppress Rebellion to Protect the Nation and People

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] President Weng Wenhao broadcasted to domestic and international audiences on the Central Broadcasting Station this evening. The full text is as follows:

This address focuses on explaining the necessity for national unity and accelerated mobilization during this period of suppressing rebellion. To understand the overall situation of our country, one must first understand the international situation of the world: World War II was the result of many countries uniting to defeat Germany and Japan, which actively pursued external aggression. Our country was united and fought with sincerity for eight years before achieving victory and recovering territories lost over fifty years. Just as the war was declared over, peace realized, and we could enter an era of genuine construction and achieve comfort and security, unfortunately, the world situation was disrupted by the Communist Party. They call themselves a political party, but in reality, they fully exploit strikes, student boycotts, and other turmoil to carry out riots and use force to devastate and destroy the people's property and the nation's integrity. This kind of action is certainly not what a political party should do; it is truly an act of rebellion against the order of political parties and legally organized bodies. It is clear that the communist parties of various countries have a consistent goal and joint actions. They echo each other to attack genuine democratic politics and undermine the people's inherent freedoms. Therefore, for the sake of protecting the country and the people, we must be of one mind and united in sincerity, gathering the strength of the entire nation to undertake our sacred mission of suppressing rebellion and saving the country.

Sincerely Implementing Constitutionalism, Exuding the Spirit of Progress

During this same period, our country is sincerely implementing constitutionalism. So-called constitutionalism is the formal end of the Kuomintang's era of political tutelage, returning political power to the people, who elect a National Assembly, formulate a constitution, and, based on public opinion, form a five-power government to exercise constitutional governance. This proves that Chinese politics has genuinely embarked on the path of democracy, working for the benefit of the people. At the beginning of implementing constitutionalism, to bear the responsibility of suppressing rebellion, we must first bring forth the spirit of mobilization and progress. This spirit was fully demonstrated during the Legislative Yuan's review of the budget, which was divided into two main points: one is to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and the other is to cut down on redundant agencies and superfluous personnel as much as possible. From this perspective, all expenditures not related to military suppression of bandits or urgent economic production should be seriously tightened or completely eliminated. This fully proves that the two tasks of implementing constitutionalism and suppressing rebellion can be carried out simultaneously, complementing each other and enhancing practical effectiveness.

Simplifying Institutions, Concentrating Manpower and Resources

In terms of implementation, the above-mentioned guidelines must be faithfully executed. Current implementations, such as the Ministry of Finance merging the Direct Tax Administration and the Commodity Tax Agency into one, reorganizing it into the National Tax Administration, simplifying the complex and reducing unnecessary personnel, and saving excessive expenditures, have the significance of tightening expenditures and increasing efficiency. In addition, the administrative branch will implement the agencies that the Legislative Yuan has determined should be cut down, and will also devise other methods to strengthen the process in the same direction. On the other hand, to increase the power to suppress the rebellion, we must be able to use the material and human resources of the whole country. Within the scope of material resources, food is even more important. Since ancient times, our country has believed that sufficient food and soldiers are the fundamental conditions for establishing a nation. To ensure sufficient food, the government has decided to implement the method of compulsory purchase and borrowing of grain. The Legislative Yuan's resolution also stipulates that the proportion of compulsory purchase should be increased and the amount of purchases at market price should be reduced, which shows that both the legislative and executive branches recognize the necessity of implementing this method, solemnly propose it, and seriously implement it. In practice, the burden on the people will inevitably be heavier, but our country's land tax has been used since the early Qing Dynasty, and prices have risen sharply, but the tax rate has not increased. During this period of suppressing rebellion, all compatriots across the country should enthusiastically support the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines, making sincere contributions, and everyone should contribute together. Therefore, it is extremely hoped that all levels of responsible executive agencies and personnel will also clearly recognize that delivering grain is a major duty at this time, lift their spirits, collect the full amount, and never be deficient or evade under any pretext.

Stopping and Reducing Inflation is a Matter of Utmost Urgency

Although there are many reasons for the current high prices, the important reason is inflation. The reason for inflation is that government spending is too high, so how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure and drastically stop and reduce inflation is the most important urgent task today. How to achieve this goal, the central government is planning methods to implement them seriously. However, this kind of necessity still requires the deep understanding and concerted action of all agencies and all aspects to succeed. This is an important point that we are calling to everyone's attention. Secondly, what I want to explain is that during this period of suppressing rebellion, it is extremely necessary for social order to be maintained and the economic situation to be stable. The people and government of our friendly country, the United States, have always sympathized with our country's hardships, and at this time they are allocating funds and donating materials to assist in construction, which is extremely beneficial to our country's overall situation. But our country should know that the effectiveness of American aid depends on whether our country can help itself. If our country can truly help itself, then the effect will be strengthened by American aid. If our country cannot help itself, then strength will be weakened by division, and resources will be ineffective due to chaos. Even with American aid, its actual effectiveness will not be as good as expected. Therefore, we must deeply establish the determination to move forward proactively. Previous errors should be sincerely corrected, and incomplete areas should be quickly supplemented. We should make the greatest efforts to improve the effectiveness of our work. Comparing the psychology of the period of suppressing rebellion with that of the period of resistance against Japan, the importance of suppressing rebellion is no less than that of resistance against Japan, but the unity and tension of social psychology are not as good. Therefore, it is hoped that all compatriots across the country will understand that the actions of the communist bandits truly endanger the foundation of the country. Today is truly a time of crisis for the survival of China's inherent culture and normal organization. Everyone is connected as one, sharing good and bad fortune. We must intensify mobilization and move forward seriously in order to support the country's fortune and stabilize people's livelihoods.

### Total Revenue of General Budget Increased by 2.6 Trillion; Frontline Soldiers Receive "Combat Allowance"

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The spokesperson of the Legislative Yuan stated on the 24th: "The total revenue of the National General Budget for the second half of this year, reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, has been increased by over 2.6 trillion yuan based on the figures originally listed by the Executive Yuan (it could have been increased by over 3.1 trillion, but because the salt tax was not increased, it was increased by fifty billion less). This increase in amount is not due to an increase in tax rates, but mostly due to the fact that the revenue figures originally listed for various state-owned enterprises and various taxes were increased in a verified manner. That is, if the originally listed figure was too low, it was increased according to the actual situation during the review, and the amount of this increase was determined after inviting the responsible persons of the various competent authorities to discuss it together, so it is very reliable." In addition, redundant agencies and superfluous personnel of various agencies have been cut down as much as possible, and projects or construction expenditures that are not related to military affairs and can be postponed have also been eliminated to comply with the purpose of reducing expenditure. However, frontline combat soldiers have been given preferential treatment, and it has been decided that the Ministry of National Defense will issue a "combat allowance" to each person based on a pre-war base of one yuan.

### Legislative Yuan Spokesperson Talks: Hoping to Adjust the Treatment of Public School Teachers

The Standards for Salaries and Public Expenses of Legislative and Supervisory Members Are Not High

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] On the 24th, the spokesperson of the Legislative Yuan, under orders, issued a written statement on the issue of the standards for the salaries and public expenses of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members, stating: "This time, the salaries and public expenses of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members were determined with reference to the examples of the salaries and travel expenses paid to members of parliament in the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Australia, Italy, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland, and are far lower than the standards paid to members of parliament in various countries. As for the transportation fee of 30 yuan and the housing subsidy of 40 yuan, these were originally part of the Yuan's office expenses. If the Yuan can provide the committee members with accommodation in guest houses and transportation, then these two expenses will not be paid. Currently, some legislators are staying in hotels, and the Yuan pays the hotel expenses, so the 40 yuan housing subsidy is not issued as an example." He also continued: "Outsiders believe that the standards for the salaries of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members are too high, but I do not think so. I am not defending the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members, but in fact, the salaries and public expenses obtained by the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members are not as much as the income of assistant staff in banks. However, the treatment of general civil servants is too low, so the treatment of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members appears to be too high. This view should be corrected, because the treatment of general civil servants is too low, which is definitely not a reasonable phenomenon, and everyone knows that it should be adjusted reasonably as soon as possible, which is the right thing to do. Therefore, legislators Jian Dangsan and Jin Shaoxian have long proposed that the treatment of public personnel should be improved, and Chen Mingxian and others have also proposed that the treatment of county-level public school teachers should be improved. It is hoped that the world of discussion will supervise the government to implement these measures as soon as possible, so that public school teachers can work wholeheartedly and improve administrative efficiency."

### Lu Yuwen Issues Statement

Believing that the Defamation of a Few People Has No Impact

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] On the 24th, Henan Province Chairman Lu Yuwen spoke to reporters regarding the criticism of his corruption by the Liujing National Delegates Association, stating that he would not argue about whether he had been corrupt during his tenure in the Henan Grain Management Bureau, and that the competent authorities, the Ministry of Food and the Executive Yuan, could prove everything. As for his opposition to the passage of the budget for the Wartime National Mobilization Committee in the Legislative Yuan, it was his personal view and opinion on national affairs, and regardless of the reaction from the outside world, he would continue to adhere to this opinion and would not change it in the slightest. Lu also stated: "A person's social status has its own social foundation, and I believe that the defamation of a few people will have no impact."

### The Wartime Construction Committee Will Not Be Abolished

The Treatment of Some Representatives Will Continue to Be Maintained

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] After the Legislative Yuan resolved to send the budget plan of the Wartime National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee back to the Executive Yuan, some delegates in Nanjing expressed their dissatisfaction. According to the reporter's inquiry, the organization will not be abolished, and the treatment of some representatives will certainly continue to be maintained.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 24th] On the 24th, the Association of Comrades Who Suffered During the War of Resistance telegraphed the whole country, opposing the establishment of the Wartime Construction Committee and the demand for salaries for National Delegates, and launched a coordinated action by branches in various counties and cities.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 24th] All the news reporters in Jinan City expressed their opposition to the demand of the 4,000 members of the Central Wartime Mobilization Committee for paid positions, and specially telegraphed the Legislative Yuan, requesting that the matter be formally rejected at the general assembly.

### Fines and Penalties Increased

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] At the Yuan meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 24th, the amendments to Articles 1, 2, and 3 of the "Regulations on Increasing the Standards of Fines and Penalties" were passed, increasing the standards of fines and penalties by up to 200,000 times. The amended articles are listed as follows:

Article 1: If a fine is to be imposed in accordance with the Criminal Law or other laws, the originally stipulated amount shall be increased by 200,000 times, but if the law has stipulated the multiple of the fine according to a certain ratio, the regulations shall be followed.

Article 2: Those who commute fines in accordance with Article 41 of the Criminal Law or commute to labor service in accordance with Article 42, Paragraph 2, shall be calculated at between 200,000 yuan and 600,000 yuan per day.

### Rumors of Secret Peace Talks Not Worthy of a Wise Man's Smile

Li Zongren Tells Foreign Reporters

[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] Recently, rumors of secret peace talks have been spreading here again. Vice President Li Zongren explained to United Press reporters today: "The psychology of Westerners and Easterners is different." When Westerners hear groundless rumors, they often want to refute them, while Easterners often let them rise and fall on their own. The so-called seeing something strange is not strange, and the strangeness will defeat itself. I do not want to come out and deny it, so as to increase the value of the rumors and cause some people to mistakenly believe that there is a reason for it. In short, this kind of rumor is not worthy of a wise man's smile.

### Gu Mengyu Visits Beiping Leaders; It Is Said That Fu Zuoyi Gave a Banquet to Welcome Him

[Another dispatch] Chairman Cheng Qian assumed his post this afternoon and took charge of the administration, and the two civil and construction halls also completed the handover at the same time.

### Draft of the National Defense Ministry Organization Law Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Review by the Legal and National Defense Committees

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The draft of the new National Defense Ministry Organization Law was resolved by the Legislative Yuan's plenary session on the 24th to be submitted to the Legal Committee for joint review with the National Defense Committee. This draft was revised by the National Defense Ministry under the instruction of the Executive Yuan, based on the principles decided by the Legislative Yuan, and was passed by the Executive Yuan's ad hoc meeting on July 17th. Its explanation regarding the powers of the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of the General Staff is as follows: "The Minister of National Defense is one of the cabinet members of the Executive Yuan, and in the position of the head of the Ministry of National Defense, he is responsible for the coordination of national security policies and military organizations. Therefore, he is responsible for planning, reviewing, and coordinating matters related to the overall national defense policy and planning and general mobilization. He is responsible for formulating and promulgating military policies and guidelines, and for reviewing and supervising military and administrative affairs. In short, the Minister holds the power to make overall decisions on military administration, personnel, finance, and materials, and supervises and examines the work of the Chief of the General Staff in carrying out these policies and guidelines, so as to achieve the reality of subordinating the military to the administration." "The Chief of the General Staff, on the one hand, is the Chief of Staff to the President as commander-in-chief according to the Constitution, and on the other hand, in the administrative system, he is the administrative officer of the Minister, responsible for the planning, guidance, and implementation of military affairs. This system is based on the American system and adapted to the national conditions. In the United States, each of the Army, Navy, and Air Force has a Minister and a Chief of Staff, and the Department of Defense is the hub of cooperation among the three services, representing the President in forming policy decisions, and using joint staff headquarters and other institutions to closely coordinate the three services. Our National Defense Ministry has a single Chief of the General Staff, who receives military orders from the President and military administration from the Minister, and makes overall plans and guidance for military affairs, which are implemented by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Combined Logistics Headquarters. This organization is considered by the United States to be a more rational and progressive system, with clear lines of responsibility and specialized functions."

### Criticism of the Draft Local Autonomy General Rules

— Tong Hangbai

Since the implementation of constitutional governance by the Central Government, democratic thoughts and concepts of freedom have flourished throughout the country. Now that the Central Government has implemented constitutional governance, local autonomy must be completed quickly. This is a matter of course, and there is no room for delay or hesitation. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council has specially organized a Local Autonomy Laws and Regulations Research Committee to collect data and study methods so that Shanghai's local autonomy work can be carried out smoothly. Since the meeting, many deliberations have been held, and it is felt that the main key at present lies in the central autonomy general rules, which are still in the drafting stage by the Ministry of Interior and under review by the Legislative Yuan. Each locality must wait for the promulgation of the general rules before it can draft local autonomy laws based on the general rules. However, if the central government's regulations on this general rule are too detailed and the restrictions are too strict, so that the localities have no room for freedom and flexibility, it will inevitably lead to trimming the feet to fit the shoes, and it will be difficult to meet the actual needs of the localities. Now, based on what I have seen and heard, I will select a few points that have a greater relationship and analyze them below as a framework for research and for the reference of the Legislative Yuan.

First, the interpretation of the law. The Constitution has clear provisions for local autonomy in provinces and counties: "Provinces may convene provincial representative assemblies to enact provincial autonomy laws in accordance with the provincial and county autonomy general rules... (Article 112)" "Counties may convene county representative assemblies to enact county autonomy laws in accordance with the provincial and county autonomy general rules... (Article 122)" "Cities (provincially administered cities) shall apply the provisions of counties." (Article 128) It can be seen that the Constitution has clearly stipulated the three levels of local autonomy of provinces, cities, and counties within the provincial system, but the municipalities directly under the central government, which should first implement autonomy, seem to be regarded as secondary by the central government. According to Article 118 of the Constitution, "The autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government shall be determined by law." What does the so-called law refer to? Article 170 of the Constitution specifies: "The law referred to in this Constitution means the law passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the President." Based on the above laws and regulations, the meaning is very clear; although the autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government does not specify that it is based on the general rules of autonomy for municipalities directly under the central government, municipalities directly under the central government should also have general rules of autonomy as the basis for the autonomy law, which is obvious. Because the general rules of autonomy must be passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the President, it is the so-called law. The general rules of autonomy are laws, which is in line with Article 118 of the Constitution, which states: "The autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government shall be determined by law," and there is no doubt about it. Unexpectedly, the Executive Yuan recently passed the draft general rules of provincial and county autonomy and sent it to the Legislative Yuan. Article 31 of Chapter 8, Supplementary Provisions, states: "According to Article 118 of the Constitution, the autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government shall be determined by law, but the autonomy laws of the respective cities may be drafted with reference to these general rules and submitted to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan for enactment." This is obviously a misunderstanding of the phrase in the Constitution "The autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government shall be determined by law" as meaning that the autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government must be enacted by the Legislative Yuan, so there is a provision for submitting it to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan for enactment. Moreover, the Legislative Yuan felt that the autonomy law was enacted by the central government, which clearly deprived the local legislative power, so it made a compromise, first drafted by the local government, and then transferred to the Legislative Yuan for enactment by the Executive Yuan, so that both parties could be taken care of. I do not know that if this law is established, it will be like leaving a huge stain in the history of Chinese constitutional governance, causing a serious trauma to Chinese democratic politics, which is absolutely unacceptable in law and reason! The people of ordinary counties and cities can still set their own autonomy laws and retain their local legislative power. Why can't the people of municipalities directly under the central government set their own autonomy laws and lose their local legislative power? Does the central government think that the economic and industrial development and the level of cultural education of the people of ordinary counties and cities are better than those of municipalities directly under the central government? Or does the central government still have differential treatment for the implementation of civil rights? If so, how can it explain itself in Article 7 of the Constitution: "All citizens of the Republic of China are equal before the law"? It is very clear that it relies on the true meaning of the Constitution. Moreover, since local autonomy is permitted, the central government can only formulate a general rule of autonomy in accordance with the Constitution and issue it to the local government, so that it can formulate local autonomy laws accordingly. There is no way to permit autonomy on the one hand and deprive it of its autonomy's legislative power on the other. May I ask if the local autonomy's legislative power is exercised by the central government, can it still be called local autonomy? If the local government cannot be autonomous, can what the central government does still be called constitutional governance? According to the actual examples of the development of civil rights in various countries in the world, local autonomy has developed from cities to rural areas. Because of the development of economy, culture, and transportation in cities, the complexity of industrial and commercial organizations and social interactions, and the advancement of public affairs, the need for the concept of freedom and autonomy is more intense and profound than in rural areas. Now, turning the cart before the horse, reversing the importance, it is difficult for wise people to understand!

Second, the implementation procedure. The implementation procedure of local autonomy is clearly stipulated in the Outline of National Reconstruction. If this procedure is strictly followed, the central government will not be able to convene the National Assembly, cannot agree on the Constitution, and cannot elect the President. In other words, it cannot implement constitutional governance immediately. The procedure stipulated in the Outline of National Reconstruction is from bottom to top, not from top to bottom; first, county autonomy must be implemented, and then provincial autonomy is implemented when more than half of the counties in the province have achieved autonomy; when more than half of the provinces in the country have achieved complete autonomy, then the National Assembly is convened to formulate the Constitution and elect the President, and constitutional governance is completed. Now, the central government convened the National Assembly, formulated the Constitution, and elected the President without waiting for the completion of county autonomy and provincial autonomy, because there are special relationships in domestic politics and special agreements between political parties, so it did not hesitate to end political tutelage and begin constitutional governance first. The procedural issue has now been abandoned in the past, and should not be raised in the future, otherwise, how can the central government explain itself for implementing constitutional governance without following the procedure? However, the Executive Yuan recently passed the draft general rules of provincial and county autonomy and sent it to the Legislative Yuan. Chapter 2 suddenly stipulates the implementation procedure. Article 6 states: "A county shall implement county autonomy when it has completed the following items: (1) The police and security are well-handled, (2) The finances are well-organized, (3) The household registration is well-handled, (4) The land registration is completed." What a strange article! Regardless of whether the so-called "well-organized," "completed," and "well-handled" meet this standard in the thousands of counties in the country, even in Shanghai, who dares to say that Shanghai's police and security, finances, household registration, and land registration have reached a state of completeness, perfection, and no regrets, and are qualified to implement autonomy? Moreover, this standard must be assessed by the supervisory authority, and the higher-level authority has room for arbitrary flexibility and free approval or rejection. The desire for local autonomy to be implemented throughout the country is like waiting for the Yellow River to clear, which is tantamount to the central government's jealousy of local autonomy! Commentators say that the central government's opening up of local civil rights is like liberating slaves, and the old man is not at ease. Can the central government not need procedures for itself, while the local government must have procedures? Moreover, the constitutional governance procedure set by the National Father is from bottom to top, but the central government has changed it to from top to bottom. Is there a need to revise the National Father's teachings? For decades, China has been accustomed to the bad habits of central centralization. The central government always grabs everything in its hands. Even for purely local affairs, the central government controls it for fear of not being tight enough. As a result, local governments have all become affiliated agencies of the central government, with small powers and incompetence. Their inability to develop freely and make achievements is also inevitable. Moreover, because civil rights are not thoroughly opened up, the people are also indifferent to politics. Ambitious people take the opportunity to resist, spread heresies in the localities, and act arbitrarily. One person calls out at night, and rioters rise up everywhere. It can be seen that the method of strengthening the trunk and weakening the branches is suitable for the past, but not necessarily for the present. There is absolutely no way to establish a country with the loss of people's centripetal force. Even the rule of balanced power takes the rapid opening up of civil rights and the completion of autonomy as the main principles. Autonomy makes it easy to gather people's strength, while official rule makes it easy to disperse people's hearts. The gathering and dispersal of people's hearts and strength have a great impact on the country's governance and chaos. I deeply hope that the central government will look far ahead, broaden its mind, and cancel the restrictions of this procedure, so that the localities can quickly achieve autonomy, so as to help the pastoral peony green leaves.

Third, the limits of supervision. Of course, there must be higher-level supervisory agencies to handle local autonomy, and we have no objection to this. However, the functions of the supervisory agency should be based on guidance, and should not control the final decision-making power of local autonomy. Otherwise, it is still official rule rather than civil rule, and it is still central centralization rather than local balanced power. Article 13 of the draft general rules of provincial and county autonomy passed by the Executive Yuan states: "Provinces and counties shall not violate central policies and laws when handling local autonomy matters." The Constitution only stipulates that it shall not conflict with the Constitution and shall not conflict with laws, and does not say that the orders of higher-level agencies shall not conflict. The reason is that the Constitution was passed by the National Assembly and the laws were passed by the Legislative Yuan, so it is reasonable that they should not conflict. If the orders are not passed by the public opinion organ, they should not conflict. Then the local autonomous government is no different from an affiliated agency of the central government. What is the meaning of autonomy? Article 61 of the draft general rules of autonomy A proposed by the Ministry of Interior states: "Supervisory agencies at all levels of autonomy may take the following actions: (1) Review budgets, final accounts, work plans, work reports, and individual regulations related to the rights and obligations of the people. (4) For the central work of autonomy, they may make decisions on behalf of the local government, and may implement them on behalf of the local government when necessary." According to the explanation of the original plan, the Ministry of Interior also made this proposal in the local autonomy reform plan proposed at the second internal affairs meeting in the 21st year, so this plan is specially stipulated. I don't know that at that time it was still in the period of political tutelage, and there were no provincial and county councils established in various places. There was nothing wrong with the higher-level agencies reviewing and implementing on behalf of the local government. Now, during the constitutional governance period, elected councils at all levels will be established. How can the higher-level supervisory agencies still overstep their authority? Moreover, the aforementioned powers belong purely to the powers of the local councils. If the higher-level supervisory agencies can exercise them on their behalf, then the provincial and county councils can be dispensed with! For example, Article 18, Paragraph 3 of the draft general rules of autonomy for municipalities directly under the central government proposed by the Ministry of Interior states: "The organization of the municipal government shall be determined by the respective municipal governments according to the complexity of its affairs and its financial situation, and shall be submitted to the municipal council for resolution and submitted to the autonomous supervisory agency for approval and filing." The so-called approval is that the higher-level supervisory agency clearly retains the final decision-making power. No matter how the municipal government formulates it and no matter how the municipal council resolves it, as long as the higher-level agency says no, it will be completely overturned; its restriction on civil rights and obstruction of autonomy is extremely obvious. It can be seen that the remnant poison of central centralization is still hidden in the draft constitutional governance bill, which is extremely regrettable!

### French Premier Announces Policy Guidelines: Promote Firm and Peaceful Diplomacy; Marie's New Cabinet Wins Majority Support in Parliament

[United Press, Paris, 24th] The Parliament is scheduled to vote on a motion of confidence for the new Premier Marie tonight. Based on the current situation, Marie can obtain the statutory majority of 311 votes and serve as Premier. The Socialist Party has announced that all its members will unanimously support him. In addition to Marie's own Radical Socialist Party, he can also obtain the support of most members of the Popular Republican Movement and the right-wing Republican Liberty Independent Republican Party. It is rumored that the position of new Foreign Minister will be filled by former Premier Schuman.

The political program he presented to the Assembly focused on foreign policy, pointing out that France's foreign policy should be based on the principle of firmness without provocation. Observers believe that Marie's special emphasis on diplomacy and placing domestic issues in a secondary position is a deliberate action to make it easier for the Parliament to approve his organization.

Marie said, "France's position in Europe should always be careful not to engage in excessive provocation, but at the same time should maintain a firm stance. If I serve as the head of the new cabinet, I will implement a firm but non-provocative diplomatic policy. France's policy toward Germany should be based on the resolutions of the London Six-Power Conference. France is willing to allow Germany to regain its rightful place in Europe, but not at the expense of the interests of other European countries. I believe that the opportunity of the upcoming UN General Assembly in Paris in September should be fully utilized to resolve the German issue. Regarding Anglo-French relations, I believe that France must move forward hand in hand with Britain, so I unconditionally support the Anglo-French 50-year alliance treaty and advocate that establishing friendly relations with Britain is my main principle."

Amidst the jeers of Communist members and the applause of middle-party members, Marie stated after forming a coalition government of five major center and right-wing parties, he then mentioned domestic plans, mainly to consolidate the national industry so that France can be proud of its industrial capabilities. Stabilizing the currency value so that the position of the franc can be maintained for generations to come. Marshall Aid is worthy of France's gratitude, but France must still prepare to help itself so that it can be self-reliant after American aid expires and ceases. After his election, he will also hire domestic elders to organize a permanent government advisory committee, using their opinions to avoid the factors that have dragged down previous coalition cabinets. Regarding the rural elections to be held in October, he declared that he has decided to hold them as scheduled and will not postpone them.

### Draft of New Note to the Soviet Union by the Three Powers; The US Sends Bohlen to Europe; The Berlin Airlift System Will Be Strengthened

[Our News] New York, 24th Broadcast: Secretary of State Marshall has ordered Ambassador to the Soviet Union General Smith to go to London to discuss the Berlin situation with American officials currently staying in England. Ambassador Smith is scheduled to depart from Moscow on the 25th.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Washington diplomatic sources believe that the draft of the second note to the Soviet Union by the British, American, and French powers has been personally carried to London and Paris by Bohlen, Counselor of the State Department and expert on Soviet issues. Military Governor of the American Zone in Germany Clay is on his way back to Berlin from the United States. His special plane will take the route through Bermuda and the Azores Islands. One of Clay's gains from this trip to the United States is that the US government has promised to allocate a large number of Air Master planes to strengthen the airlift between West Germany and Berlin.

[United Press, London, 24th] The US government urgently summoned its highest-ranking military and diplomatic experts on Germany and the Soviet Union to Europe on the 24th to urgently discuss the Berlin crisis. This unprecedented move occurred just before the climax of the crisis. The Western allies will soon send another note to the Kremlin, which may open the door to four-power negotiations. The location of the US expert meeting has not yet been determined. Participants will include Marshall's top advisor on the Soviet Union Bohlen, General Clay, who met with Truman and Marshall in Washington, Ambassador Douglas to the UK, who is negotiating with the UK and France in London, Ambassador Smith to the Soviet Union, who was ordered to go to Berlin on the 23rd, and possibly Ambassador Murphy, Clay's political advisor. Bohlen's trip to Europe allows the three-power talks to be elevated to several levels and avoids the time-consuming exchange of telegrams across the Atlantic. This spring, Smith presented his famous letter to Molotov, which caused a great uproar. The drafter of this letter was Bohlen.

This move would give the government sufficient time to conduct negotiations. Clay expressed optimism about the future when meeting with reporters. He quoted President Truman's opinion on the 22nd, saying that the chances of peace were very good. He dared to assert that no country wanted war, including the Soviet Union, and that those who engaged in robbery would cause war. He was confident that the Berlin dispute would be resolved in a way that would not lead to war.

### Can the Soviet Union Launch a War? (Part Two)

— Translated by Cai Quansheng

The Soviet Union lacks a canal system with the vast capacity of transportation routes like those in Western Europe. It has no inland waterways, only a few large rivers, but for most of the year, these are frozen. Therefore, 83 percent of domestic transportation in the Soviet Union relies on railways. However, even in its industrial regions, the railway system is very incomplete. Its railway length is only equivalent to that of the United States in 1872, but it must serve a territory three times as large. The total length of railways in the Soviet Union is only 57,000 miles, while the United States today has 226,000 miles. Railway transportation is the first key to the Soviet economy, and it will hinder the progress of the Soviet Union in the coming years.

Even under the new Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will only build 4,500 miles of railways. The reason is that its pre-war railway network was concentrated in the west, which fell into the hands of the Nazis and was severely damaged, requiring reconstruction first. The Soviet Union is being forced to restore most of its railway equipment. Many old locomotives are in use, and various vehicles were confiscated from Germany and its vassal states.

We can learn more about the Soviet Union by studying its automobile industry. Like other industries, the Soviet automobile industry is state-owned and politically controlled, and it does not produce any basic cars. It imitates British and American vehicles, and there is generally nothing to change. Even so, the Soviet automobile industry is not developed.

The Soviet Union's use of manpower tells us a lot about its potential to launch a war. A Moscow magazine, "Economic Issues," compared a Soviet power plant with a power plant in the southern United States. The two plants have the same output, but the United States only uses 51 people, while the Soviet Union needs 480 people. The American power plant has only 17 staff members, while the Soviet power station needs 91 people. Under the communist economic system, the Soviet Union needs 11 people to work to produce 1,000 kilowatts of electricity, but in the United States, only 2 people are needed.

The situation in coal production is equally obvious. In the United States, 90 percent of all coal mines are developed by machines, 60 percent are transported by machines, and only 4 percent are removed by hand. But in the Soviet Union, a large amount of coal is mined by hand.

Soviet coal mines, like other Soviet industries, are full of non-producers. A Swedish mining engineer who recently visited the Soviet Donbas coal region found that for every four slave laborers mining coal, there was a Soviet engineer, manager, technician, or political administrator supervising them. The number of Soviet people used to oppress laborers may even be greater than the number of workers in other countries. But in a communist economy, the productivity of slave labor cannot compare to that of free workers in a free economy.

The Soviet Union has the most manpower in the world, second only to China and India, but the entire Soviet Union has only a small number of trained technical personnel. According to careful statistics, even by 1960, the Soviet Union's per capita productivity would be, at most, only half of the United States' per capita productivity 30 years ago.

### The General Labor Union Plans to Eliminate Industrial Disputes; All Executive Directors Will Petition the Social Affairs Bureau Tomorrow Morning, Requesting Salary Calculation Based on Current Index

The Municipal General Labor Union held a meeting of executive directors at 10:00 AM yesterday to address the current index dispute. Chairman Shui Xiangzhen first reported on the labor-management disputes arising from the change in the cost of living index to bi-monthly publication and the subsequent determination of salary standards by the evaluation committee. He then clarified his views and reasons regarding the realistic issues of the case, and discussions commenced immediately. During the meeting, participants spoke enthusiastically, and the following important resolutions were summarized: (1) Regarding the index issue, a further request will be submitted to the authorities to adopt the principle of calculating salaries based on the current index. (2) All executive directors will be appointed to visit Director Wu on Monday morning (26th) to petition, urging adoption and implementation as soon as possible to safeguard the livelihoods of workers.

The Director-General of the General Labor Union States Reasons

[Further News] After the General Labor Union passed a resolution yesterday requesting the government to calculate salaries based on the current index, the Director-General of the Union, Shui Xiangyun, explained the reasons to reporters, stating that the General Labor Union previously reported, based on reports from various industrial unions, that prices have recently skyrocketed, and the index is out of sync with prices. Calculating salaries based on the previous month's index would result in significant losses for workers and make it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the Union decided on several comprehensive measures to request the government to adopt and implement. In terms of fundamental solutions, a new household survey will be conducted. In terms of immediate solutions, prices will be surveyed every Tuesday and Friday, and the index will be published twice a month, etc. All proposals have now been approved and implemented by the government, and we deeply appreciate the authorities' care for workers. However, the General Labor Union's proposal to publish the index twice a month was intended to ensure that workers in the city receive two salary payments per month and can enjoy the right to have their salaries calculated based on the current index. For example, the worker index for May was 337,000 times, for June it was 710,000 times, and for the first half of this month it was 1,380,000 times. The dramatic increase in each index is often doubled. Therefore, if salaries are still calculated based on the previous period's index, the difference between wages and prices will be too great. Not only will the publication of the index twice a month not be beneficial, but it will also be detrimental and contrary to the original intentions of the Union's request and the government's bi-monthly publication of the cost of living index.

Hoping for Support from Employers

Since the publication of this period's index, disputes over salary calculations have arisen repeatedly. Although the evaluation committee has determined standards and methods, the rapid daily fluctuations in prices continue to affect the livelihoods of workers. Even if there are agreements in various industries to follow their customary agreements, it can be said that they are no longer timely. Given the current reality, workers, compelled by their livelihoods, cannot continue to abide by agreements or customs and disregard their actual living conditions. The Union, standing from the perspective of labor, must make this statement. While we understand that employers in various industries are also bearing significant burdens, we have no other choice. We deeply hope that employers will understand the difficulties of the times, strive to support us, and overcome the difficulties together, he said.

### Index Disputes Resolved in Foundry and Weaving Industries

[Reported by this newspaper] Disputes over the index-based salary issue involving workers in the foundry and weaving industries have been resolved through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, and agreements have been reached.

### Escalating Costs in Shipping Industry; Appeals for Government Support

[Reported by this newspaper] The prices of fuel and materials in the shipping industry have skyrocketed, and the index for employee salaries and benefits has increased dramatically. Requests to adjust freight rates have repeatedly been reduced, resulting in a significant gap with costs. Furthermore, the continuous soaring of oil prices recently will make it impossible to sustain operations. The Shipping Association specially appeals to the government for support; otherwise, it will adjust rates at any time according to actual costs, it is said.

### Industrial Association's General Assembly Approaching; Proposal Submissions Accepted Starting Today

[Reported by this newspaper] The preparatory committee of the Municipal Industrial Association held its seventh preparatory committee meeting yesterday.

Proposal submissions will be accepted starting today. Further news: The paper box industry is facing soaring paper prices and difficulties in paper supply, requesting the Industrial Association to find solutions to the raw material problem. The preparatory committee resolved to request the Paper Industry Association to supply paper at a reasonable price as much as possible. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan recently decided to abolish the Municipal Industry and Commerce Guidance Office in order to save on the budget. However, the industrial community in the city unanimously believes that the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has indeed contributed to the development of the city's industry. Therefore, it was decided that the Industrial Association will submit a request to the central government to retain the organization of the Municipal Industry and Commerce Guidance Office to continue its guidance work.

### Cargo Plane Converted to Passenger Plane; China Airlines Invites Viewers to Witness Test Flight

The conversion has now been completed, and China Airlines is scheduled to host the press at Longhua Airport at 10:00 AM this morning to witness the test flight.

### Viewing the Yangtze River's Power from the Great Flood of the 20th Year of the Republic

— Special Correspondent Kang Feng

The fate of three-quarters of the Yangtze River region hinges on future water levels; if there is news of the upper reaches stopping rising, half its vitality can be preserved.

[Special Dispatch from Wuhu, Twenty-Second of This Month] This spring's rainfall has been particularly heavy, causing the long-dry Yangtze River to fill up with water very early. During the summer flood season, the melting snow from the mountains of western China flows into the river. The snowfall was exceptionally heavy last winter, rushing into the river and adding summer floods to the spring floods. Coupled with the exceptionally large amount of summer rainfall, the Yangtze River's water level is like the yang energy of a typhoid patient, with the high fever almost spiraling out of control.

From the Great Flood of the 20th Year of the Republic onward, the Yangtze River basin has enjoyed annual harvests for seventeen years, even during the ten years of the War of Resistance. Although its brother, the Yellow River, changed course at Huayuankou for ten years, leaving thirty million farmers in the southeastern Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces without a roof over their heads, the Yangtze River uniquely enjoyed good fortune. The reason why residents along the Yangtze River in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces were able to easily endure the ten years of suffering during the War of Resistance was largely due to the annual harvests.

This was also because the Yangtze River had less water and lower water levels for seventeen years. In addition, the Yangtze River embankment, which was abandoned after being repaired with funds from the American loan for cotton and wheat presided over by Song Ziwen in the 21st year of the Republic, restrained the river. People along the river relied on the river for sustenance, led by powerful figures. Poor farmers and disaster victims who were recruited as tenants provided labor to demarcate and build embankments and polders on the winter-exposed sandbars in the heart of the river and in the two major lakes, Dongting and Poyang, as well as various smaller lakes along the river in the four provinces. As a result, the lakes and swamps that originally accommodated the summer floods and the sandbars in the heart of the river became fertile new fields. These fertile lands were particularly productive. After the lakes and swamps were enclosed by embankments and polders, each mu (unit of area) of rice field yielded about eight dan (unit of volume) or more of rice. For example, the Tianyou Polder in Dongting Lake, which the people of Hubei insisted on creating, consistently harvested two million dan of rice annually from hundreds of thousands of mu of rice fields. Similarly, in Chen Yao Lake at the intersection of Tongcheng and Wuwei in Anhui after the war, the Pujji Reclamation Society reclaimed 250,000 mu of polder land. The 20,000 mu of polder land that had already been built last year had an output of 100,000 dan, a bumper harvest. After the successful construction of polders on the sandbars in the heart of the river, soybeans, sesame, and other miscellaneous grains could be sown, resulting in abundant harvests every season. This kind of "making the water give way" was an excellent remedy for increasing production and alleviating poverty. For seventeen years, local governments have refrained from interfering, and even some leaders have been involved in leading production increases. This was beneficial and harmless to the overall national economy in years with little water, but over time, the large and small lakes and sandbars that originally served as natural reservoirs for the Yangtze River have all become permanent farmland. The American loan reservoir of Dr. Savage in the Three Gorges area has not been started due to construction costs and time. Encountering the high water volume of this year's spring and summer floods, the Yangtze River, the hero who brought happiness to a hundred million people along the river for seventeen years, is roaring in the thunderstorm to tear apart the autumn harvest dream of a hundred million people this year. Not only has the natural reservoir defense line been breached this year, still serving as its reservoir, but it will also destroy the main embankments along the river, repeating the tragic situation of the 20th year of the Republic.

Faced with such a flood volume, any water conservancy agency and water control expert are powerless. The Ministry of Water Resources' funding only allows it to distribute flood prevention equipment and materials to the provinces during normal years. For example, the 800 kilometers of the main embankment of the Yangtze River in Anhui received 70,000 sacks this year. If a 10-kilometer breach is destroyed, 70 million sacks will not be able to alleviate the emergency. Today, when the water level is as high as 11.25 meters (Wuhu water level on July 22), the Yangtze River embankment, which is only 13 meters high at the top, can only be guarded day and night by tens of thousands of farmers using their own bodies. On rainy and stormy nights, when the river waves crash against the shore, the farmers desperately shout and carry soil to fill any small breaches or cracks they discover in the river embankment. The sound of gongs directing the rescue effort beats tighter and tighter. It has been almost eight days since July 15 that the Anhui and Hubei sections of the Yangtze River have been guarding in this way, truly like the anxiety and worry of caring for a relative suffering from typhoid fever, fearing intestinal bleeding in the last few days!

People all know that the new and old polders of Dongting Lake have all been submerged. The consequences are concerning after the high water level in Chongqing on July 19 reaches Wuhan on the 22nd and 23rd. It is rumored in Hankou that the Ma Hua and Tongren embankments, which protect the northern shores of Hubei and Anhui, have been breached in seven counties, including Huangmei and Susong (the Yangtze River Works Office in Anhui has not yet received a report of the Ma Hua breach at this time). It appears that the Yangtze River's momentum has already caused a major disaster in July, but this has only made about a quarter of the river region uneasy. August and the last nine days of July are the decisive period for the rice fields in the remaining three-quarters of the river region. The rice fields are covered with ripening ears of rice, and they can be harvested in thirty days. If there is news of the Yangtze River's upper reaches stopping rising, the river region can still retain half its vitality. Let us closely watch this yellow river flow eastward!

### Wuhu Water Level Slightly Drops Yesterday; Hope to Pass the July Flood Barrier

[Dispatch from Wuhu, 24th of This Month] Today's water level in Wuhu is 11.21 meters, a drop of 0.04 meters compared to yesterday. If the upper reaches also drop, it is hoped that the nearby river embankment will pass the July flood barrier.

### Listing the Various Difficulties Currently Faced, Jianfeng Asks the Central Government for Relief, Replenishing Cotton Stockpile, Head Allocation, and Supplying Coal, Electricity, and Fuel

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, Jianfeng Company sent a memorial to President Weng of the Executive Yuan, listing the actual difficulties currently faced by the company and requesting the central government to find ways to resolve them. The company's current difficulties include the following: (1) Raw cotton problem. Because the cotton-producing areas have been reduced to bandit areas by the Communists, it is impossible to conduct in-depth purchasing. Those that have not fallen are also unable to purchase large quantities due to transportation difficulties, restrictions on the exit of cotton from various places, and farmers' insistence on trading in silver dollars. The method of exchanging yarn for cotton currently being promoted by the company has unknown results. In the past, the amount of foreign cotton received was relatively large, which could still maintain production, but now foreign aid has decreased, resulting in a large reduction in the company's raw cotton reserves. (2) Because the import of spare parts is under strict control, the spare parts of each factory cannot be replenished, which affects work efficiency. Moreover, due to insufficient supply of coal and electricity, most factories only partially operate. For example, in Yingkou and other places, the losses are very large due to the war, and the number of operating yarn spindles and cloth machines is small. (3) Supply of military uniform materials. The amount supplied is huge, and it is first traded and then priced, and the surplus is deducted from the payment, so the company suffers a great loss. The company's capital is limited, and it cannot bear the burden in the long run. (4) Rationing of cloth for government employees and teachers. Because the goods are delivered first and then priced, and the surplus is deducted from the payment in advance, the loss is large, worth about 22,000 dan of raw cotton. (5) Price stabilization sales. The company carried out price stabilization sales in coordination with government orders to stabilize the market price of yarn and cloth, but the loss was huge because the allocation price was much lower than the market price. The current improvement measures are first to replenish the raw cotton reserves. In addition to intensifying the purchasing work, it is planned to expand the method of exchanging yarn and cloth for cotton, and increase the amount of foreign sales to exchange for a large amount of raw cotton. For the distribution of military cloth, it is hoped that cash-on-delivery transactions can be implemented in the future. It is also hoped that the Executive Yuan will order all localities to protect the purchase and transportation of cotton; the supply of coal, electricity, and fuel should be given priority to Jianfeng factories because their supply to the military and civilians cannot be reduced.

### Rice and Coarse Grains Are Weak, Flour and Cooking Oil Are Firm

Yesterday's rice market was weak due to the weakness of the market the day before and the low prices reported in Wuxi, which made people feel empty and tired. In addition, the rice shops' acceptance was quite dull, so the market opened with a drop of 1 million yuan, and the market became even weaker later. White japonica rice has retreated to 40 million yuan. In the Nanshi market, white japonica rice was 38.5 million yuan, and in the Beishi market, special high-quality japonica rice was 42 million yuan. Because the factory's acceptance was not strong, coarse indica rice retreated into the 30 million yuan range. The lowest price was 28.8 million yuan for bagged indica rice. Yesterday's arrivals were 1,539 dan in the Nanshi market and 1,449 dan in the Beishi market.

Flour prices had fallen significantly for several consecutive days, and the money market eased. The owners were not in a hurry to sell, while retail investors and actual sellers took the opportunity to buy. The market was buoyant. Lao Che flour once reached 12 million yuan and closed at 11.9 million yuan. Bingchuan flour opened very high and then fell to 10.8 million yuan at the close, with each rising by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands also rose across the board, and bran added 300,000 yuan. Wheat was 15 million yuan as originally priced.

The coarse grain market was still weak at the opening, but it turned firm near the close, and the closing price rose sharply. Soya beans closed at 17 million yuan, an increase of 500,000 yuan. Corn was firm. Buckwheat and peas were small at first and then firm. Tianjin traders took in broad beans, and the market was very firm and rising. Green beans were stable. Sesame was taken in by Tianjin traders, and white sesame was priced at 50 million yuan, an increase of 3 million yuan. Raw peanuts were slightly weak at 2 million yuan.

The cooking oil market fluctuated and trended higher. At the beginning of the market, it was still hovering at the original price of the previous day, and the sales were not active. Soybean oil opened at 75 million yuan and once fell to 74.5 million yuan. However, as the money market eased, retail investors came to buy, and soybean oil finally traded at 77 million yuan, an increase of 2 million to 3 million yuan. Vegetable oil closed firmly. The price of vegetable oil in Jiji barrels opened in the central market and was still at the original price of the previous day. Small vehicle sesame oil rose by 1 million yuan, and the market was tight in the later market. Soybean cake was level at first and then firmed. Changzi cake finally sold for 7.9 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Weak and Unable to Rise

Since the price of red and green tea has been continuously and fiercely set after production, the owners in this city have hoarded goods and raised prices, but the buyers are unwilling to rush to buy because the money market seems to be easing but is still tight, so the trading continues to be as sparse as the morning stars, and the process is unable to rise again. According to people in the industry, Zhenmei and other green teas, which were mainly sold to Africa in the past, are still favored there, but the prices offered are extremely stingy. The exporters have called overseas in the past few days to request an increase in tea prices, but they have not been approved so far. In this situation, the sales of Chinese tea to the Philippines are temporarily afraid that there will be no significant situation.

### Guangzhou's Money Market Is Strange; Prices Fall Across the Board

### Two Trillion Sugar Cane Loan Handled and Paid by the China Farmers Bank

The first batch of 300 billion has been remitted to Taiwan.

The two trillion yuan of sugarcane loan approved by the Four Joint Offices this spring has now been started by the China Farmers Bank. The allocated amount is 600 billion yuan in July and 700 billion yuan in each of August and September. The interest rate is 1.66%, and the term is 18 months. The first batch of funds has been allocated by the National Bank to the Agricultural Bank for 300 billion yuan. The Agricultural Bank commissioned the Bank of Taiwan to remit the funds to Taiwan Province on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of this month. According to the current exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender, which is 1 to 1257, it is only worth more than 238 million Taiwan dollars. Another 300 billion yuan (legal tender) will be remitted next week. When the remittance is due, Taiwan Sugar Corporation will hand over the combined currency to the Bank of Taiwan, and then convert it into legal currency for repayment, which will have to wait for the Four Joint Offices to approve. The above loan was approved in March, and at that time, the exchange rate could be converted into 18 billion Taiwan dollars. Later, due to the rise in the exchange rate, the current total loan amount is only worth 16 billion combined currency, which is too far from actual needs. The Taiwan Sugar authorities are deeply concerned that it will hinder increased production, and came to Shanghai a few days ago to consult with relevant authorities on how to handle it. It is reported that the shortfall will be borne by the Bank of Taiwan as much as possible. If the bank's capital is insufficient, it will be requested that the Four Joint Offices add additional funds. This issue must also be decided by the Four Joint Offices.

### The Yarn and Cloth Market Turned Strong Near the Close

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was fluctuating at the beginning, and the willingness of the local and foreign buyers was still lax. The sales were sluggish, and the people's minds were also tending to be calm due to the flat and tired cloth prices. 42s Blue Phoenix yarn opened slightly better at 60 million yuan in the morning, but the asking price fell back to 50 million yuan due to the light appetite of the buyers. Near the close, foreign hot money invaded, and the willingness of all parties to take in was active, so the market revived, and finally closed at 1.65 billion yuan, a rise of 10 million yuan. The original price of Monday was unchanged, still 1.75 billion yuan. 21s Double Horse yarn also rose by 40 million yuan due to the excitement of all parties to take in. The prices of other thick and thin yarns mostly rose and fell less. The transaction volume was reported to be only 95 pieces.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was slightly turbulent. The sales of well-selling fine cloth were slightly more prosperous. At the opening in the morning, it was said that cloth and yarn could be transported and sold abroad, and people's minds were beautiful and the asking price was once chaotic. The high price of the leading fine cloth was 50.5 million, and there was no transaction. The opening price in the court was 48.7 million yuan, but the sales of the merchants were affected by the stimulus of negative news, and they frequently came to sell. The actual sales in this street were also clear. At 10:30, it was seen as low as 45.3 million yuan. Later, it was learned that the leading fine cloth and Four Gentlemen Yuan Pi Ji of the Jianfeng Company were not opened, and the blank compensation ended at 46.5 million yuan, a rise of 2 million yuan compared to the previous day. The outside court shouted 500,000 yuan higher. The markets for the remaining cloths were firm and stable. The total daily transaction volume was 2,220 pieces.

### Many Stocks Rise and Fall Sharply; Most Chinese Stocks Fall to the Limit

Hot stocks generally ended with a price cut of about half a percent.

The opening price of Yongsha in the morning was 11,850 yuan, and the rest of the stocks saw mixed success and failure.

Although Nos. 16 and 98 advanced to 11,330 yuan, rumors were incessant, and unstable rumors arose about the future of the Securities Exchange. Nos. 154, 104, 67, 180, 179, 4, and 55 supplied, and finally fell to the daily limit at a price of 10,730 yuan. The limit of nineteen drops in the remaining stocks was reached, and hot stocks carried out price-cutting transactions, and Yongsha retreated to the 10,000 yuan mark to end.

### National Bank Seeks to Improve the Price of Overseas Remittance Certificates

Since the implementation of the new exchange settlement method, the income from overseas remittances has not been as ideal as expected. The National Bank is now preparing a concrete method to speed up the absorption of overseas remittances and is submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The focus of this method is (1) Overseas remittance exchange settlement certificates will be given an additional percentage according to the export exchange settlement certificate method. That is, an overseas remittance certificate of 7.5 jiao (unit of currency) is equal to an export exchange settlement certificate of 1 yuan. (2) In addition to being able to purchase and use export exchange settlement certificates, importers can purchase and use overseas remittance exchange settlement certificates to offset imports. The above method can be implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan.

### Extreme Shortage of Yellow Cardboard: Paper Box Industry Petitions

[Special Dispatch] The Paper Box Industry Association of this city states that the main raw material, yellow cardboard, is in extreme shortage and prices have soared uncontrollably. Before the recent holidays, the price was 50 million yuan per ton, but now it is a staggering 600 million yuan. Moreover, only goods from other cities are available on the market, business is almost at a standstill, and the situation is serious. Therefore, representatives were sent to relevant authorities yesterday to petition for help. They hope that all paper mills will suspend delivery of warehouse receipts issued before June, and that existing inventory will be sold to paper box factories at reasonable prices. Furthermore, they request that the paper box association members be allowed to directly purchase the monthly output to avoid exploitation, and that a thorough investigation be conducted into those responsible for hoarding and creating a rampant black market. The authorities have agreed to promptly seek appropriate measures, and the results are extremely satisfactory.

### Ministry of Education Lists Key Points, Orders Beijing to Improve National Education: Organise Parent-Teacher Associations, Increase Contact with Society, Shorten Promotion Limitations and Improve Spirit of Service

[Special Dispatch, Nanjing, 24th] Based on the results of inspections of national education in Beijing by Ministry of Education supervisors Wu Xueceng, Zhang Fengxiang, and 18 others, the Ministry of Education has put forward 14 points for improvement and has specifically ordered the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau to comply with them. The most important points are recorded as follows: (1) The school buildings are insufficient and efforts should be made to add, recover, and expand them. (2) Financial affairs should be made as public as possible. (3) The current system of seniority-based salary increases is too slow, and the years required for promotion should be shortened based on performance appraisal to improve the spirit of service. (4) The selection of teachers by the bureau is not in accordance with the law and should not be done again in the future, but each school should be required to hire normal school graduates. (5) Teaching is too focused on textbooks and lacks practical activities. (6) There are 80 or 90 students in each class, which is not suitable for both teachers and students, and classes should be divided or enrollment should be limited. (7) Moral guidance lacks leadership for students to engage in conscious and self-motivated activities. Civic training has not been effectively implemented. (8) Parent-teacher associations have not been formed, and there is a lack of contact with families and society. (9) There are still many out-of-school children, and a large number of school levels must be added, and each agency should be encouraged to establish children's schools and public education classes. (10) Each school's public education class should have a full-time teacher or restore the number of public education teachers, effectively supervise the classes, and include the performance of public education as one of the important evaluations of the principal.

### Beiping College Students Fleeing to Shanghai: Flock to Public Institutions, Private Schools, Except for the Best, are Ignored

[Beiping, 22nd, by airmail] Beiping has become a concentration point for college students fleeing from North China, and the problems of living and studying are very serious. Public schools that do not charge tuition fees and have public funding are overwhelmed with applications during the summer enrollment period, with an average of one person being admitted for every 20 applicants. Private schools, except for those with outstanding performance, are mostly ignored, forming two extremes. The fate of these students who fail to get into public schools and cannot afford to attend private schools is particularly concerning. The number of applicants to Peking University and Tsinghua University this year is even greater than last year. The number of applicants in the six regions of Beiping and Chongqing has already been counted. Tsinghua University has 2,894 applicants in the Beiping region and over 800 in the Chongqing region (the total number of new students admitted is only 500). Peking University has 4,919 applicants in the Beiping region and 1,443 in the Chongqing region (the total number of admissions is only 400). In addition, the total number of applicants from Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Shenyang will be considerable. The tuition fees for private universities, middle schools, and primary schools in Beiping have not been determined in most cases this year. If the government cannot provide subsidies, they will be calculated based on the price of flour, and the number of out-of-school children will increase sharply at that time.

### Academic Institution Feature: 17. Nantong College

History

Nantong College has a history of 43 years. Its predecessor was the three specialized schools of agriculture, medicine, and textile founded by Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong. In the 18th year, the three schools merged and were approved by the Ministry of Education to change their name to the current name. During the Anti-Japanese War, Nantong was occupied, and the school moved to Shanghai in the autumn of the 27th year to resume classes. After the victory, it still returned to Nantong in stages in the 35th and 36th years. However, due to equipment, teaching, and other reasons, some of the agricultural and textile departments are still taught in Shanghai. Recently, as the order in northern Jiangsu has not yet been fully established, the school has decided to separate the school in Nantong and Shanghai instead of relocating and merging to facilitate progress.

Current Situation

The school currently has three departments: agriculture, medicine, and textiles. The agricultural department has three departments: agronomy, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and agricultural economics. The textile department has two departments: textile engineering and dyeing and chemical engineering. The medical department does not have separate departments according to the regulations of the medical college. The entire school has more than 160 faculty and staff members and more than 900 students, with a distribution ratio of approximately four to one between Nantong and Shanghai. The school also regards the three departments of agriculture, medicine, and textiles as practical application disciplines, so the affiliated businesses of each department are extremely complete. The agricultural department has a farm, a livestock farm, and an agricultural product processing farm. The agricultural area in the Nantong campus is only about 100 acres. In addition, there are 700 acres of cotton fields and 120,000 acres of land to be reclaimed in the coastal area. Unfortunately, due to transportation obstacles, they have not been used since the victory. The medical department has an affiliated hospital with 150 beds and more than 30 doctors, which is sufficient to serve as the central hospital in the coastal and riverine areas of northern Jiangsu. The textile department has three factories: a practice textile factory, a weaving factory, and a dyeing and finishing factory. The textile factory is currently in operation, and the other two factories are being renovated.

Enrollment

The school will enroll new students in all departments and will also accept transfer students. New students must have a high school diploma or equivalent qualifications. Transfer students must have transfer certificates from equivalent classes. Both male and female students are accepted. The examination subjects and application procedures are similar to those of general universities. The registration dates are August 5th to 7th, and the examination dates are August 9th and 10th. The locations are in Shanghai and Nantong. The Shanghai location is at 270 Chongqing North Road.

### Our World Games Basketball Team Loses to Egypt in Practice Match: Lou Wenao Attracts Attention in England

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] Chinese 10,000-meter long-distance champion Lou Wenao practiced at the Ockesbridge World Games venue today. Many spectators believe that Lou is the most prominent figure in the Chinese World Games delegation. Lou did not show any amazing performance when starting in practice, but reporters believe that Lou is not without possibility of scoring at this conference based on his past records. Lou and his sparring partners usually wear running shoes and are in good spirits during recent practice. He shares a room with Taiwanese athlete Chen Yinglang and practices together. However, Lou's recent unofficial practice results are not unusual because he has never faced a real game. Local sports observers believe that he will make great progress and is undoubtedly the most promising scorer for China at this World Games. In addition, the Chinese World Games basketball team lost to the lesser-known Egyptian team with a lopsided score of 67 to 40 in a practice match yesterday, which was "surprising". The Egyptian team has only four years of experience, but after applying American coaching, they showed the latest style of play and were very accurate in shooting. The Egyptian team had previously played a practice match with the Korean basketball team. The Chinese basketball team is scheduled to play several games before the official opening of the World Games on July 29.

### Women's Softball Championship: Randeng and Jiaolian to Meet at the Top: 4:30 p.m. at the Racecourse

[Special Dispatch] In the senior women's softball league hosted by the International Sports Association, the two winning teams, Randeng and Jiaolian, will play the championship game of the first week at the racecourse at 4:30 p.m. today. Since the beginning of the season, Randeng has won five games, and Jiaolian has defeated six opponents in a row. The former has Cheng Mulan's pitching, Wu Hanyun's catching, and Lin Jingyi and Cai Baoqiu's batting. There is a deep tacit understanding between the infield and outfield. Last season, they overpowered the group with a swift offensive and won the Shanghai Open Women's Softball Championship. Jiaolian has gathered the elite of foreign players, with abundant strength but insufficient strategy. However, the team's fighting spirit is very strong, and they will give their all in every game. In terms of strength, Randeng is indeed better, but in terms of spirit, if Randeng's players cannot unite as one and fight against the enemy together, Jiaolian will have no hope of winning the championship. Randeng's lineup for today's game is as follows:

Pitcher Cheng Mulan, catcher Wu Hanyun, first base Xu Aizhen, second base Lin Jingyi, third base Cai Baoqiu, shortstop Shen Shuwei, center field Yin Yiguan and Li Guanjin, left field Guo Zhichang, center fielder Zhang Luoluo, Shen Yiqi, right field Tang Xiaoyu.

[Additional News] Due to the recent unpredictable weather, which has affected the progress of the league, the International Sports Association is now considering canceling the second round of matches. If so, the sea queen of softball will be produced in today's battle.

### Save the Parents!

— Pingzhai

Nowadays, people often point out certain malpractices in the education sector, invariably saying, "Save the children." However, they don't realize that parents have genuinely reached a point where they desperately need saving.

In today's world, with the newly issued large-denomination banknotes and the disastrous fall in the value of the legal tender (fapi), the people's faith in fapi has already been severely shaken. Yet, the owners of schools of all levels openly took the lead in advocating that tuition fees should be calculated based on the price of several dan (a unit of dry measure) of white rice. This is clearly and directly striking a blow against the credibility of fapi—and so far, there has been no sign of any action taken by the education authorities to stop this.

Not only are they not stopping it, but they are also adding fuel to the fire!

Please see the education section of this newspaper on the 22nd. The Municipal Education Bureau is again uniformly stipulating the uniforms for students in secondary schools in this city. "Senior boys are to wear Zhongshan suits, and girls are to wear qipao (cheongsam). Junior boys and girls are all to wear Boy Scout uniforms... The colors for spring and summer are light yellow, and for autumn and winter, evergreen." Reading this kind of news truly makes one feel like both laughing and crying! What day is this? The people's livelihood is declining, industry and commerce are in recession, and the salaried class is already on the verge of not being able to afford even simple meals. They've barely managed to get their children to have one old set of clothes to wear, and that's considered good enough. But now, after crossing the high threshold of the school gate that is "measured in rice," they have to taste the flavor of this "officially designated" axe! Each student has to add two sets of clothes. How much money will that cost? The young masters and misses from wealthy families may still complain that this kind of uniform is too "tidy" and demeans their noble status. But in this time and place, just how many young masters and misses from wealthy families are there? I don't know if the municipal education authorities have time to read the newspaper on weekdays, but if they did, they shouldn't forget that recently, there have been rice-grabbing riots in places like Wuxi and Ningbo! Today should be a time of pioneering work and painstaking management. To show achievement, there's no need to focus solely on superficial displays. If these superficial displays didn't harm the common people, it would merely indicate the leisurely pursuits of officials, and it would only mean that official documents would go through a few more rounds. It could also keep a few underfed and not-quite-starving junior civil servants alive. What's hateful is that when it comes to official matters that increase the burden on the people, these documents often travel with extraordinary speed. Therefore, we cannot help but worry and express our concern.

Furthermore, what's the benefit of middle school students wearing uniforms? Neatness? Beauty? If it were a time of peace and prosperity, when people had enough food and clothing, then talking about neatness and beauty would be fine. But now, it's different. If there are still people closing their eyes and shouting about neatness and beauty, then that person, if not mentally ill, is quite comparable to the Jin Dynasty's Emperor Hui.

Moreover, the waste of materials from students suddenly having to make new clothes when they already have clothes to wear is quite considerable. Didn't we expend tremendous effort to transport cotton from the United States? Materials are so scarce that we should cherish how they are used! Why should we massively consume them in places where we can save? If we speak harshly, in the current situation, deliberately wasting materials like this is simply sabotage, that is, intentionally or unintentionally assisting the rebellion!

Today's urgent task is to strive for social stability. To have social stability, we must avoid unnecessarily increasing the burden on the people. It's already difficult enough for students to enter the school gates. Can't we just stop with uniforms and the like? At this time of scorching heat, the esteemed gentlemen of the Education Bureau should take turns walking around the vicinity of the Pierre Apartments at the northern end of Zha Pu Road Bridge to see more of the emaciated refugees. Perhaps it can cure their "heatstroke."

### Feicheng Peach

— Zhuying

The Feicheng peach is a specialty of Feicheng County in Shandong. The peach is yellow in color, has a recessed tip, a round and small pit, and a sweet taste. The large ones weigh more than half a pound and are sold in large commercial ports such as Pingjin at a high price. Today, those sold on the market that are green in skin and have a small, pointed tip are mostly counterfeit products. When I was a guest in Feicheng, my friend Mr. Liu often gifted them to me, so I was able to taste the delicious flavor of this peach often. The peaches produced in the two or three peach orchards within the city are considered to be the true variety. Those produced within thirty li (a Chinese unit of distance, approximately 500 meters) of the city are also called Feicheng peaches, but the taste is slightly inferior. Every early autumn, peddlers carrying loads on their shoulders come in an endless stream along the road. It is a pity that not all the peaches they are selling are Feicheng peaches. Many villagers plant peaches as their livelihood. I have visited each garden in the city and found that the trees are not very large, but the peaches are abundant and the branches and leaves are very lush. Everything relies on manual cultivation. Each main branch is made to develop in a balanced way, and almost all the side branches are fruiting branches. All branches affected by disease and insect pests are completely pruned away. At the time of pruning, the number of fruits is determined according to their age. When the flowers are budding, they are most afraid of fog. Several piles of wheat straw are always placed under the peach trees. Whenever there is heavy fog at dawn, the straw is set on fire, and the smoke rises halfway to the sky to ward off the fog. When the spring is deep and the flowers are blooming, the gardeners are very diligent in their care, because breaking off one flower means damaging one peach, and one branch of flowers would damage an unknown number of peaches. There have been cases of lawsuits arising from breaking off flowers. When picking peaches, a cloth bag is attached to a pole. When the peaches are seen to be ripe in color, they are picked with the pole, and the peaches fall down the pole and are caught by the bag.

All the gardens enshrine peach deities, and incense and offerings are provided. No one dares to disobey, because it is said that offending the deity will cause the peaches to fall overnight, leaving only the pits with the flesh removed and the tips facing upwards. This is merely superstitious talk.

### Wonderful Method for Eliminating Mosquitoes

— Cangyu

During World War II, a place in India was plagued by disability. The British army tried hard to carry out preventive work, but they were never able to eliminate the malaria mosquitoes.

When the American army doctors arrived in India, they came up with a method. It turned out that mosquitoes rely entirely on emitting ultrasonic waves that are inaudible to the human ear to attract the opposite sex for courtship. The American army doctors set up many sound-emitting machines in the wilderness, broadcasting sound waves of the same frequency as female mosquitoes to attract male mosquitoes and exterminate them. Although most of the mosquitoes that bite people are females, once the number of male mosquitoes is reduced, the female mosquitoes are unable to reproduce offspring, and a dangerous outbreak of malaria gradually subsided in this way.

### Psychology of Movie Fans

— Sun Jialin

After watching a movie, or when friends get together to chat, in addition to discussing the plot, the beauty, charm, generosity, and elegance of the movie stars are invariably brought up. You may like star A, while he loves star B. Perhaps you will argue about the excellence of "your own star" and become red in the face?

There are reasons for our different preferences and admiration for stars. Upon careful examination, it is not without cause. However, many of our psychological activities are unconscious, which is what is called "subconscious" activity. Why one prefers a certain star is also a type of "subconscious" activity.

The basic principle for liking stars of the same gender (that is, men looking at male stars, or women looking at female stars) is "liking those who are similar to oneself." Whether it is in physique, appearance, personality, or posture, in whole or in part, or even just in some small habits, it will arouse our goodwill and preference. For example, those who like sports are particularly fond of stars with strong physiques; those who speak gently are particularly fond of gentle and elegant stars; tall and thin people like tall and thin people; lively people prefer lively people; those with bright eyes and white teeth especially like long eyelashes and big eyes... One can infer other instances from this.

The reasons for admiration and liking of stars of the opposite gender are more difficult to explore, because our subconscious is more complicated. Ms. Hilary Lynn of the United States has analyzed the preferences of American women for male stars and came to some conclusions. Female movie fans in our country may wish to compare her conclusions with your personality to see if she is right.

If you admire Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, "Tarzan" Weissmuller, etc.—you are one who enjoys being dominated by men, and you are willing to be conquered by strong men. You like decisive, resolute, and heroic men. You also like him to pursue you single-mindedly and regardless of everything.

If you admire Ronald Colman, Charles Boyer, etc.—you like things that are mysterious. You like to hear other people's secrets, and you also hope that others will confide their secrets to you, and you also like others to explore your secrets. This kind of man, with a composed and reserved attitude and a strong sense of self-confidence, although his emotions seem rather indifferent, is provocative to you! He can make you willing to use all your strength to pursue him, even if it means being crushed to pieces.

If you admire James Stewart, Kenny Baker, etc.—you want to dominate men. You pity the weak. This kind of obedient, childish man, although clumsy and shy, is enough to arouse your maternal love.

If you admire Leslie Howard, Tyrone Power, Cary Grant, etc.—you like elegant, gentle, sensitive, idealistic, and extremely romantic lovers. His love is pure and noble, and he is willing to obliterate himself and sacrifice everything for love. But you have not met such a man in real life, and probably will not in the future. He is the lover in your dream world.

If you admire Robert Taylor—you like change, are good at socializing, and your personality is unpredictable. You are one who wants to dominate men.

If you admire Bing Crosby, Robert Montgomery, Fred Astaire—you like cheerful, muddle-headed, and witty young men. You love to manage men and dominate men.

Bits and Pieces: Every time a representative of the United Nations makes a speech for one hour, the work of the staff in translating, recording, organizing... etc. requires as many as 388 "man-hours" (that is, 388 people working simultaneously for one hour; if one person works, it will take 388 hours).

Britain has newly invented a "wall-mounted radio," which looks exactly like a world map and can be hung on the wall. If you want to listen to the broadcast from Radio Paris, you just need to insert a light bulb in the place on the map marked "Paris" and you can receive it very clearly. If you want to listen to the broadcast from London, just insert the light bulb in the place on the map marked "London." Another new trick in Britain is that radios can also be installed on bicycles, just like in cars.

In recent years, the United States has been actively developing Alaska. The initial motivation was to strengthen national defense, but unexpectedly, people who migrated there discovered gold mines, so the number of people requesting to go there increased sharply. And when mining, they even unearthed a large number of fossils and prehistoric relics, which are very valuable, and the residents' profits tripled.

Whenever members of Congress receive letters from people in their electoral districts inquiring or making suggestions, they always reply to every letter. Therefore, the government specifically gives senators a postage subsidy of US$105 per person per year, and representatives a postage subsidy of US$75 per person per year.

Xue Yanqin

Among contemporary celebrities whose alias is "Yongkuan," besides Weng Wenhao and his relative by marriage Zhang Shouyong (deceased), there is also the old Beijing opera actress Xue Yanqin. (Xue's real name is Huang Yongni.) Weng and Zhang's affairs are neither worth writing about nor necessary to write about, but Yanqin's experiences, if condensed, could make for a long novel of a million words, truly a tragic character in the style of Thomas Hardy.

Twenty-five years ago, there were four actresses in Beijing whose voices were most famous, and who were political figures on the "era of the replacement of Li and Cao," Yanqin was one of them. The other three were Qin Xuefang, Bi Yunxia, and Jin Shaomei, and Yanqin was the youngest. This summer, I traveled to Beiping and obtained a photo of Yanqin in ordinary clothes taken in Taiyuan at a deserted stall near Xuanwu Gate. She is holding a brush in a scribbling pose, with countless books on leather bindings placed next to her. This woman studies opera but her nature is close to literary matters, hence this simulated work. At that time, among the four actresses, Bi Yunxia's life was the most chaotic. Qin Xuefang and Yanqin practiced Islam, and their lives were relatively purified, but Xuefang was arrogant and stubborn, not as lively and adaptable as Yanqin.

In the past ten years or so, Yanqin married Pu Kuang, the younger brother of Ji Yi, and once lived with him in Tokyo. Although Kuang was a playboy and did not engage in production, he never sided with Zhan Yi. After the July 7th Incident, cultural figures who fell into the hands of the Japanese often used Kuang's house as a gathering place for banquets, secretly discussing escape. Someone shielded Guo Dingtang's escape, and the plan was first made in Kuang's residence. The creation of this situation and atmosphere was due to Yanqin's fondness for interacting with literary and artistic people, not because Kuang truly had such clear vision.

Before long, Yanqin returned to Beiping with Pu Kuang. Kuang no longer had permanent assets and relied on eating away at Yanqin's remaining wealth to live. He then had an affair with a drummer, and they divorced the year before last. At this point, Yanqin only had two small houses left, and she received only a few bags of flour in rent each month. Yanqin is over forty years old, but her demeanor is handsome and elegant, and her hair shines like lacquer. She lives next door to the novelist Zhang Henshui, and can paint simple flowers, people call her "Mrs. Huang."

### White Ash

— Chen Ye

When the war started in the 26th year, some people only had some black whiskers. A year or two later, by the time of victory, their beards and hair had completely turned white. One of my neighbors was like that. Some people were just big kids, a year or two later, after eight years, they had completely lost the shadow of childhood. I am like that. During the war, people's years were spent only in pitiful waiting and hoping. After eight years, people began again to pitifully hope and wait. A year or two, the young people will gradually grow old.

The days are gray and white, even if the body has not aged, people's hearts are also aging and withering. On a rainy morning, I took a rickshaw out and passed through two rather quiet streets and saw a young couple walking towards me, showing colors of worry. Although I don't know what they were worried about, most of it must be about money, life, and marriage. I think it is so. Today's young people are an unfortunate generation. I haven't seen anyone showing the colors of youthful joy and vitality for a long time. Young people do not have the joy of youth. I rarely go to the cinema now, the ticket prices are too expensive. Once I saw a colorful film in Suzhou, the movie showed the abundant trees and fields, the wide and flat highway on the other side of the Pacific, the crystal blue sky, and the beautiful sunlight. I felt that such beautiful sunshine had not been seen in our lives for a long time. It seems that our life is mostly overcast.
