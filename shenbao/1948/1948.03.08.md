### Liaoning River Banks Exhibit Capture War; National Army Has Obtained Strategic Advantage; Northern Jilin Sweeping Team Recovers Wulajie

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned the Eighth Army Commander Li Mi at 11:00 AM on the 7th, giving instructions reportedly related to the Northeast war situation.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] (1) The battle of Siping is progressing fiercely. Besides bandits approaching the southwest corner of the city near the airfield, another group is approaching the urban area from the north and northeast. The defending army is fiercely resisting the attacking bandits. (2) The vanguard of the National Army's southward advance troops in Liaoning has reached its predetermined area. The siege of Benxi can be lifted soon, and the recovery of Liaoyang is also imminent. The suppression of bandits in southern Liaoning will be the good news from the Northeast this spring. (3) Benxi, an important industrial and mining center southeast of Shenyang, was attacked on the 6th by bandits from the south and west, targeting the outer strongholds. Another group of bandits advanced from the Sijiatun to Benxi railway line at Waitoushan Station, attacking the Huolianzhai railway station west of Benxi. The National Army dispatched a large force from a certain location for reinforcement, so there are no concerns about Benxi.

[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 7th] The National Army on both sides of the Liao River has gained a strategic advantage and is launching a capture operation to encircle and annihilate the main force of the bandits. A certain army corps of ours is currently advancing on separate routes and has made contact with the defending army in a certain area, preparing to launch a sweeping operation against the bandits.

[Central News Agency Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] The bandit force that infiltrated the Siping airfield launched an attack on the Xipu area west of Siping on the evening of the 5th under the cover of artillery fire. At the same time, bandit forces gathered east and northeast of Siping also started moving at dawn on the 6th. Our air force is currently cooperating with the ground defending forces to launch attacks in separate directions.

[Central News Agency Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] Our southward advance troops have made smooth progress in recent days. The remnants of bandits scurrying around Benxi have shown signs of wavering. To contain our defending army's offensive, the bandits launched an attack on Sanjiazi (west of Benxi) and Shijinling (south of Benxi) with a portion of their forces on the morning of the 5th, but were repelled. Another group of over a thousand bandits, on the morning of the 7th, scurried from the Waitoushan area towards the Dalianzhai (north of Benxi) National Army positions, and were also repelled.

The Rehe provincial administration will be temporarily managed by the newly appointed Director of Civil Affairs, Gan Guozhen. It seems that Fan plans to open the transportation line between Jinzhou and Chengde and rebuild the Rehe Corridor between the Northeast and North China before formally returning to Rehe to govern.

### Shen Newspaper Calls on the U.S. for Military Aid to China

Requests Recognition of the Northeast Issue

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] An editorial in the "Northeast People's Daily" on the 7th, titled "U.S. Aid and the Northeast," commented on the importance of U.S. aid to the Northeast's military. If the essence of the Northeast issue is thoroughly recognized, it should be known that U.S. military assistance is absolutely indispensable. The newspaper pointed out that Li Lisan went to a certain party for help in January last year and obtained equipment for 22 divisions. In addition, the CCP's Northeast Bureau had secretly agreed with the leader of the Korean Communist Party that over 100,000 Korean communists trained by a certain party in North Korea infiltrated the Northeast to fight, leading to a gradual reversal of the war situation in the Northeast. The newspaper continued: President Roosevelt's concessions at Yalta were deeply regrettable.

### Businessmen's Association Cables Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Support of MacArthur's Opinion

[This City News] The National Federation of Business Associations believes that General Douglas MacArthur's recent cable to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, specifically pointing out that China's revival is premised on the early completion of the suppression of the rebellion, is truly insightful. The association specifically cabled Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing to express its support. The cable vaguely stated that MacArthur's vision is broad and his insights are accurate and essential, truly worthy of being a great world statesman. Furthermore, his pointing out that China's revival depends on whether the military can complete its task early is a sharp observation. (Regarding various news regarding U.S. parties' views on the issue of aid to China, see column one of page two.)

### Zhang Zuoxiang and Wan Fulin Appointed as Advisors by National Government

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The National Government has issued a clear order announcing the appointment of Zhang Zuoxiang and Wan Fulin as advisors to the National Government.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Ma Zhanshan returned from Shanghai to the north by "Overlord" aircraft today, arriving in Beiping at noon. The three elders are old and seemed unable to bear the hardship of a long flight. After getting off the plane and returning home, Ma Zhanshan almost fainted and closed his doors to visitors. According to Wan Fulin, the situation in the Northeast is like a patient: taking only one dose of medicine will not help. One must continue taking several doses and then rest to recover one's health. Zhang Zuoxiang will handle private affairs in Beiping and return to Tianjin in the next few days.

### Northeast Petition Delegation to Meet Chairman Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The Northeast petition delegation, Wang Huayi, Zhang Baozi, etc., are scheduled to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at 4:00 PM on the 8th to present written opinions. According to Wang, the current situation in the Northeast is becoming more precarious, and military reinforcements are even more urgently needed. This situation will be personally conveyed to the Chairman during the meeting. The second problem is that the issue of the circulating banknotes must be resolved. They are currently waiting for Zhang Jia'ao to come to Nanjing to negotiate in order to stabilize the Northeast economy. Wang and others paid respects to the mausoleum on the morning of the 7th and attended a dinner hosted by Yu Youren and Liu Zhe at noon. (Regarding suggestions for appointing talent from the Northeast, see column four of page two.)

### Liaobei Chairman Xu Liang Will Lead Cavalry to Post

Expresses Determination to Conduct Affairs Within Provincial Borders

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] The newly appointed Chairman of Liaobei Province, Xu Liang, is extremely anxious because the Siping airfield has fallen and he is unable to fly there. He has stated that he will lead cavalry to his post. If there are problems in Siping, he will definitely not handle Liaobei provincial affairs in Shenyang. Xu's intention is that Liaobei provincial affairs must be conducted within the borders of Liaobei Province. The current issues are the political coordination of military affairs, and the strength of local forces cannot be ignored. According to reports, Xu was previously in charge of reorganizing and training cavalry in Qian'an to return to the Northeast, and he also held an important position in the cavalry.

### Chu Xichun Leaves Tianjin for Tanggu

According to reliable sources, a certain brigade of the National Army stationed in Shuyang has made a strategic retreat. Currently, the bandits show signs of moving towards the Tongyu line, but it is generally judged that this is a covering action by the bandits. If the bandits were to move in this direction, it would not have much significance. But for an army of 20,000 to march hundreds of li, there must be a very big plan.

### Bandit Chief Wang Aoyi Killed in Border Area Between Zhenjiang and Danyang

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 7th] Military news: The 9th squadron directly under the Baozhen Self-Defense Corps of the Garrison District, at around 6:00 PM on the 5th, searched and suppressed hidden bandits in the border area between Zhenjiang and Danyang.

On the afternoon of the same day, a bandit force under Kang Da was defeated at Zhijiagang.

### Kowloon City Case Still Awaiting Negotiation; Concrete Negotiations to Be Held on Shameen Incident

### Main Task of This National Assembly: Elect the President and Vice President; Three Parties Conduct Consultations on the Issue of Candidate Nomination; Attending Delegates Report Starting on the 19th

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The National Assembly is approaching. According to sources from the Preparatory Committee, the main task of this assembly is to elect the President and Vice President. Revising the Constitution was originally also a task of the National Assembly, but the revised draft of the Constitution has already been proposed by the Legislative Yuan. However, the draft of the Legislative Yuan should have been submitted six months before the meeting, and the Legislative Yuan has not submitted a draft. Another is the joint proposal to modify by one-fifth of the representatives, but the general public hopes that this meeting will not have a revised draft, because the implementation of the constitution has only been three months, and the constitution should not be revised. Therefore, if there is no revision of the constitution at this assembly, then after the opening of the assembly, only a few preparatory meetings will be held, and the president and vice president will be elected, and the meeting is expected to last about two weeks. It is also learned that the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party will discuss the issue of whether to amend the constitution and nominate candidates for president and vice president before the meeting and then make a decision.

Editorial

### The Road to Democracy – A Dedication to the March 8th International Women's Day

Today is the thirty-eighth International Women's Day, and also the first Women's Day in our country after the implementation of the Constitution. In a word, the women's movement is the movement of women's participation in politics, striving for freedom and equality between men and women in politics and economics. Therefore, this year's March 8th Women's Day is particularly worthy of our attention in China during the constitutional era.

The essence of commemorating an annual festival lies in a rigorous review of the past, self-alertness and self-encouragement, so that we can work harder in the future and move towards this lofty common goal. The significance of our commemoration of Women's Day is also to enable women all over the world to review the past and encourage the future on this day. Everyone knows the origin of International Women's Day. Thirty-eight years ago today, women in Chicago, USA, held a large-scale demonstration parade to strive for women's liberation, shouting slogans of political and economic equality between men and women. A year later, the second International Women's Congress was held in the capital of Denmark. The whole congress unanimously resolved to designate "March 8th" as International Women's Day, and put forward many proposals such as "equal pay for equal work," "protecting mothers," and "implementing an eight-hour work system." Since 1992, women in various countries around the world have held commemorative ceremonies every year on March 8th. Chinese women were relatively backward, and only began to hold this era-significant commemoration in 1924, which has now been 25 years of history.

Today, we take this opportunity to look back at the achievements of the international women's movement over the past forty years. We certainly cannot exaggerate and say that the women's movement in the past was a complete failure, but we also cannot allow exaggeration, saying that the women's suffrage movement has now reached its intended goals. Because on the surface, the constitutions of various countries in the world recognize the legal equality of men and women, and stipulate that women have the right to participate in politics. In particular, the new constitution of our country stipulates that the number of women elected in various elections shall be determined by law, and specifically guarantees that the number of women elected shall not be less than 20% of the total. It can be seen that women are not only equal to men, but also superior to men. However, in practice, the opportunities for women to participate in politics and their political and economic status in various countries are still inferior to those of men. Even in the UK and the US, where women's rights are most developed, women's status still depends on the continued efforts of women themselves. There are certainly many factors that contribute to this situation, but the most important ones are the traditions of society and the problems of women themselves. Especially women, in the status of women in civilized countries all over the world, are far behind.

We certainly cannot deny that Chinese women have made significant contributions to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but due to the lack of universal education, most women are still illiterate and do not know what the women's suffrage movement is all about. Although women in cities can hold rallies today to warmly commemorate March 8th Women's Day, most rural women do not know what "March 8th Women's Day" is. What they need is not the right to participate in politics, but basic life and knowledge. Therefore, the essence of the women's issue in China today should not be to strive for legal equality, but to strive for actual equality between men and women. Educated women account for only a small part of the women in our country. Therefore, the most basic work at present is to popularize women's education, to awaken them, and to enable them to actually participate in politics.

I remember that in the first year when "March 8th Women's Day" started in our country, the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen gave a speech to general educated women, calling on female compatriots across the country to thoroughly awaken, cooperate and unite, and work together for the revolution. This sacred instruction still contains infinite significance for the women across the country in our country, which has just begun to implement the Constitution. The completion of China's democratic politics depends on the joint participation of the people across the country; whether Chinese women can fully participate in politics is a major test of China's democratic politics. We hope that the women's suffrage movement in the future can penetrate into China's political democratization movement, so that these two movements can be combined into one, and at the same time achieve our intended goals. This year is the year of constitutional implementation in our country. We hope that female compatriots across the country will move forward in unison and take the road to democracy. However, the biggest obstacle to China's political democratization at present is the Communist bandits' military rebellion. Therefore, when commemorating March 8th Women's Day today, we must especially emphasize the importance of women's participation in the work of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Everyone should understand that if the Communist bandits are not eliminated, the country will have no peace, then any empty talk about the women's suffrage movement will also feel meaningless!

### US Military Aid to China Issue: State Department and Military Have Different Opinions; Foreign Affairs Committee Raises Two Issues on Aid to China Bill

[United Press Washington 7th] Well-informed sources said on the 7th: Recent developments indicate that extreme division has occurred among US officials regarding the quantity and type of aid to China. The division between military leaders and the State Department is plain to see. Marshal MacArthur and General Wedemeyer have successively provided testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, apparently deeply believing that sufficient military aid must be provided to China in order to completely drive the Communist army out of the Northeast and North China. However, there is still no sign that the State Department intends to change its original position. State Department officials said: In addition to the already announced surplus military equipment for aid to China, there is no intention to provide further military equipment to the Chinese National Government.

[Central News Agency Washington 6th] When the US House Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the restrictive economic aid to China plan proposed by the State Department last week, it focused on discussing military aid to China to resist the Communist Party. Due to the support of senior US generals General MacArthur and General Wedemeyer, and their strong advocacy of military aid to China, the Foreign Affairs Committee paid more attention to this issue than to the Marshall Plan outline. When the eleven Democratic and fourteen Republican members of the committee listened to opinions on the issue of aid to China, they had different views on whether the CCP threatened the existence of the Chinese government and whether the success of the Communist Party was equal to the Soviet Union controlling China. The committee raised two important questions on the issue of military aid to China: (1) Are the Chinese National Army well-trained and able to make good use of the materials provided by the United States? Marshall's answer was "No." According to him, he visited China a few years ago, but some who advocated military aid to China and visited China after Marshall firmly believed that if the US military advisory group gave the Chinese National Army appropriate training (this training has not yet been approved by the country), the Chinese army would be very capable of this. (2) What kind of military aid does China need? If the United States does not actively participate in China's anti-Communist civil war in the military field, what is the maximum amount of US aid to China? To what extent and at what point in time will this military aid last? What resources can the United States provide to China? If the United States does not actually guarantee the political and military security of the Chinese government, to what extent will the United States intervene in the China issue? Most of the above questions were raised by Democratic members. Those who support military aid to China have made general answers to these questions, saying that China needs very little military aid except for ammunition, weapons, and some other equipment. The United States can take out the above items from its surplus materials on Pacific islands and supply them to China without affecting US domestic resources. As for the US involvement in China's civil war, General Wedemeyer, a senior planning officer of the US Army, pointed out that the United States does not need to participate in China's civil war, it only needs to provide the Chinese army with weapons, and they can complete the task. It is believed that once the drafts of the aid to China plan are prepared, when the Senate and House of Representatives begin formal debates, the two houses can discuss whether the military aid to China plan and the economic aid to China plan should be combined.

### Wong Wen-hao Arrives in Shanghai

Discusses Key Work of the Resources Commission

To Increase Production and Exports

[This City News] Chairman of the Resources Commission Wong Wen-hao came to Shanghai yesterday on official business. The reporter rushed to meet him and asked about the Resources Commission's business operations in various places. Wong replied: "Important news has been published in the newspapers at any time and need not be repeated. What I can tell you is that the Resources Commission is now focusing on the following three points in promoting its work:

(1) To increase the production of materials, such as bituminous coal. All provinces along the Yangtze River have coalfields with excellent coal quality. In the past, due to insufficient manual labor, the quantity and use depended on coal from the north, which was transported over long distances. The Resources Commission is now selecting several coal mines in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, transporting and installing various related equipment such as power generation and water pumping to increase coal production to meet urgent needs. All the effects are now increasing month by month. Another example is steel. In the past, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in the Northeast was the largest production base. Recently, it was temporarily lost due to the Communist bandits' attacks. The Resources Commission has a foundation for producing coal and iron in Peiping and making steel in Tianjin in recent years. It is now producing seriously to meet needs. Central China and South China produce iron ore with good quality, but they have not been smelted due to the lack of coking coal. The Resources Commission will build immediately and promote it simultaneously with coking coal to establish a new foundation.

(2) To increase export trade, the Resources Commission has been handling the export of tungsten, antimony, tin and other minerals for debt repayment and barter trade for many years. Recently, Taiwan sugar has increased in production and is being vigorously promoted to Japan and Nanyang. In addition, the first export of cement to the Philippines has begun. The domestic production volume is rapidly increasing, so the number of cement exports will also be further increased to increase the substantive contribution to the balance of international payments.

(3) To improve the efficiency of industrial and mining enterprises, commodity prices and wages in our country have risen significantly after the war, resulting in a significant increase in production costs. In order to improve the health of the industrial economy, we must effectively improve work efficiency so that the capacity and quantity of production can be improved, and the burden of materials and labor can be reduced. The Resources Commission is now supervising various units to work hard in this direction.

### Petition Group Submits Proposals for the Appointment of Talents from the Northeast

Submits a Letter to Dean Tai Requesting Swift Implementation

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th] Regarding the appointment of talents from the Northeast and the recognition of academic qualifications of young people from the Northeast, the Northeast People's Petition Group reported to the Central Standing Committee on March 3rd. On the 7th, it submitted a letter to Dean Tai Jitao, requesting a speedy approval and implementation. Minister of Education Chu Chia-hua will host a luncheon for the group on the 8th, and Dean Tai will also attend to discuss this issue. The petition group's letter to Dean Tai is as follows: "Our group is entrusted by the entire people of the Northeast to come to Beijing to petition. In addition to strengthening the military, political, and economic aspects related to saving the current crisis, we have submitted requests to the relevant authorities. In particular, as the situation becomes increasingly dangerous, winning people's hearts is even more important. Therefore, the appointment of talents from the Northeast is related to the country's long-term plan. When our group attended the Central Standing Committee meeting on March 3rd, we proposed that the academic qualifications of students who graduated from public and private middle schools and above in the Northeast provinces and cities since the founding of the Republic of China until the fall of the Northeast are not registered with the central government due to the special circumstances of the environment and the central government's inability to implement its policies. However, we found that this situation is purely a political relationship and should not affect the future of talents. We request that their academic qualifications be equivalent to the same effective qualifications as domestic public and private schools recognized by the Ministry of Education and be allowed to take higher examinations, ordinary examinations, and special examinations in various subjects. At that time, the Standing Committee resolved to adopt it. We are deeply gratified that Your Excellency attended the Standing Committee meeting and provided a lot of support. We hereby submit it again, respectfully requesting a speedy approval and implementation to value talents and maintain people's hearts. We are anxiously awaiting orders."

### Our Large-Scale Fertilizer Powder Factory Gradually Resumes Its Former Glory

[Central News Agency Nanjing 7th] Our country's only large-scale fertilizer powder factory, Yongli Sulfo-Ammonia Factory, is gradually recovering from the eight years of destruction and damage by the enemy to the scale it had when it was established in 1937. Yongli Chemical Industry Company, under the planning of the late chemical giant Fan Xudong in 1934, decided to establish an ammonium sulfate factory in Xiejiadian, Liuhe County, Jiangsu Province, near the capital, in order to develop China's chemical industry. After hard preparations, it officially started construction in the spring of 1937. Soon after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, it was bombed three times by enemy planes. In December of the same year, the factory site was occupied. The enemy occupied the factory for eight years. However, because all the factory blueprints and records were moved to the rear, the Japanese were able to partially start work after more than two years of speculation. The newest sulfuric acid factory model was completely moved to Japan. At the beginning of the victory, although the former general manager of the company, Fan Xudong, unfortunately passed away, under the leadership of his successor, chemical expert Hou Debang, personnel were sent to Beijing to prepare for resumption of work. After difficult repairs, it was able to report shipment again in July 1946. Currently, it produces more than 130 tons of fertilizer powder per day, which is close to the factory's scheduled quantity. According to the person in charge of the factory, the government and UNRRA have provided great assistance in this resumption of work. If the new UNRRA machinery worth one million US dollars can be installed in two to two and a half years, the factory's output will double at that time. The nitric acid factory machinery seized by the enemy will also be shipped back from Japan, and the future development of the factory can be predicted.

### Shanxi Provincial Government Applies to the Executive Yuan for Reclamation Loans

The provincial government plans to mobilize 10,000 refugees with labor capacity to reclaim 300,000 mu of old wasteland near Bing City in accordance with the Ministry of Agriculture's measures to encourage civil reclamation. A Refugee Reclamation Administration has been established, planning to allocate 10 to 20 mu of vegetable land to each person. The reclamation will be completed during the spring plowing period. During the reclamation period, each person will be given two sheng of millet per day. It is estimated that 42,000 shi of millet will be needed in the seven months from reclamation to harvest. According to the current grain price in Bing City, approximately 252 billion yuan is needed. The provincial government has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Four Joint Relief Agencies, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and other relevant parties to approve the above-mentioned refugee reclamation loan of 252 billion yuan to relieve the victims and increase production.

### Dutch and Luxembourg Representatives Return Home for Instructions The Brussels Conference Continues Today The Form of the Western European Alliance Treaty is Yet to be Determined The Principle of Common Defense is Under Negotiation

[Reuters Brussels Sixth Dispatch] It is known that several important matters were discussed at today's five-nation Western European alliance conference. Representatives from the Netherlands and Luxembourg will return to their countries immediately to seek instructions from their governments. According to British Ambassador to Belgium Rendel after the meeting, some clauses in the draft treaty were discussed today and still need to be referred to their home governments for instructions. The next meeting will be held on Monday, but the delegations will hold private talks on Sunday. French Ambassador Oudry de Crouy also said that there would be no significant developments in the conference before Monday. Although the countries have reached an agreement, the question is in what form this agreement should be presented.

[Agence France-Presse Brussels Sixth Dispatch] The impression among the participants is that a consensus has been reached on the general outline of the future treaty, but the actual form and legal wording of the final treaty remain to be considered. There are three ways to form the treaty: (1) a bilateral agreement; (2) a four-party agreement signed by the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, as well as France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg; (3) a multilateral agreement signed by the five powers. The latter agreement is the most popular because it includes many aspects and opens the door to other countries. The treaty will cover political and economic aspects, with economic aspects being particularly important to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The treaty does not include a concrete plan for military cooperation, but will stipulate the principle of joint defense against aggression, as in the "Petropolis" Inter-American Treaty.

[Reuters Brussels Sixth Dispatch] The British Embassy told our agency that although the draft treaty of the five countries of the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg does not stipulate details of the military part, the principle of joint defense is being discussed. According to people close to the delegation, the memorandum submitted by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will serve as the preamble to the five-nation treaty, and the articles will be a compilation of the articles from the British-French draft and the Dutch-Belgian-Luxembourg draft. According to reliable sources, the issue of Italy's participation in the Western European alliance was discussed at today's meeting, but Italy will only participate after the five countries of the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg sign the treaty.

### Bevin Plans to Discuss with Western European Countries to Expand the Scope of the Alliance The Five-Nation Treaty Can Be Signed in the Short Term

[Reuters London Seventh Dispatch] Official sources claim that Foreign Secretary Bevin and Foreign Minister Bidault will go to Beijing to sign the five-nation Western European alliance treaty before or after the European sixteen-nation conference is convened in Paris on March 15. It cannot be determined now, depending on whether the five-nation delegation currently negotiating in Beijing can complete the draft agreement by the middle of next week. If the Western European Treaty is completed before the opening of the sixteen-nation conference in Paris, it has two advantages: one is to provide concrete evidence that Western Europe has decided to integrate its policies and economic strength, and the other is to provide the countries participating in the Marshall Plan with a basis for expanding the possibility of a Western European alliance. Observers are convinced that Foreign Secretary Bevin will take advantage of the opportunity of the sixteen-nation representatives gathering in Paris to hold informal talks with the foreign ministers of some of these countries to listen to their opinions on the future relations of Western Europe. Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and Swedish Foreign Minister Undén will be the people whom Bevin hopes to have informal discussions with on the possibility of expanding the Western European alliance. Recent news from Beijing stated that the five-nation Western European alliance treaty will keep the door open so that any European country willing to participate can do so. The biggest difficulty in expanding the five-nation treaty is that neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland are unwilling to participate in any treaty with military obligations. Therefore, it is expected that the clauses in the five-nation treaty drafted in Beijing concerning security guarantees will be stipulated in the most general terms to make it easier for other countries to participate. As for the five countries of the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, if they want to have more specific restrictions in the military field, they can continue to maintain contact on the point of mutual defense after the implementation of the five-nation treaty.

### Zorin Appointed Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia

Czechoslovakia is Willing to Continue Trading with the West

[Associated Press London Seventh Dispatch] TASS announced today that the Soviet government has appointed Zorin as the Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

[Reuters Prague Seventh Dispatch] Czech Foreign Trade Minister Gregor told foreign reporters that Czechoslovakia's foreign trade policy remains unchanged. The principle is still to import raw materials and export manufactured goods. The main target of exports is still Western countries. Although the goal of the five-year plan is to increase exports to the East to 45% of total exports. Gregor also stated that Czechoslovakia will continue to fulfill the trade agreements it has concluded with foreign countries, and hopes that other parties will do the same.

### People Fleeing from Northern Finland into Sweden

[Associated Press Helsinki Sixth Dispatch] It was learned today that the Karelians in northern Finland were shocked to hear that the government would negotiate and conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union. They are now fleeing the country and entering Sweden. Border guards intercepted as many as thirty men, women, and children last night. The Karelians were formerly Soviet citizens. They moved to Finland around 1920, but because they have not applied for naturalization, they are deeply afraid that if Finland signs a new treaty, they will be handed over to the Soviet Union.

### French Prime Minister Schuman Wins Parliament's Confidence

General Belief that the Political Climate is Extremely Bad

[Jiè Zhòng Society Paris Sixth Dispatch] After a lengthy meeting of the French National Assembly, Prime Minister Schuman finally won fifty votes of confidence. Faced with strong opposition from the Communist Party and de Gaulle, Schuman said that if the National Assembly could not support his forced public debt plan, he would submit his resignation. Observers believe that Schuman's intention is to ask the parliament to resign if it accepts any of the sixty-eight amendments passed on January 7. During the adjournment of the parliament, about fifty amendment clauses have been rejected. The parliament has never had such open hostility towards the Prime Minister's domestic policy. Schuman's vote of confidence is also considered dangerous. Most observers believe that Schuman's center-left Popular Republican Party coalition cabinet has gone through another crisis.

[Liên Jin Society Paris Sixth Dispatch] The French National Assembly voted several times today on Prime Minister Schuman's anti-inflation bill. Schuman's majority party support has weakened. Congressional observers do not believe that the cabinet crisis is imminent, but believe that the political climate is bad and accidents may occur. The Communists submitted an amendment today, which was rejected by 304 votes to 290. Schuman won by a margin of only fourteen votes. The Communist Party submitted a motion to fully promote the new economic bill, which was rejected by 301 votes to 288.

### Soviet Union's Policy Towards Eastern Europe Focuses on Plunder and Destroys European Reconstruction US House of Representatives Foreign Aid Committee Issues Report

[Associated Press Washington Sixth Dispatch] According to the report of the House of Representatives Foreign Aid Committee, the Soviet Union is wholeheartedly constructing various businesses in its vassal states, so that they can be quickly refitted to produce military supplies. The report also lists the following points: (1) The United States' loan to Finland to purchase equipment to produce timber is actually tantamount to helping Finland pay reparations to the Soviet Union, and Finland can therefore export timber to pay the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union's policies towards Finland, Hungary, and Romania are mainly based on plunder. (3) The Soviet Union is attempting to develop Soviet-style politics in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia. (4) Soviet policy may be more political in the future and less focused on economics. (5) The Soviet Union is doing its best to crack down on opposition parties in Eastern Europe, so that they cannot effectively resist Sovietization policies, and even in countries such as the Czech Republic and Finland, where there is no opposition party, it is stepping up control. (6) Because of the "friendly" nature of the governments of its vassal states, it can charge high prices for the goods it exports and pay low prices for the goods it imports. The committee issued this report to prove how the situation in the Soviet Union's vassal states can affect the reconstruction plan of Western Europe. Small countries bear the obligation of large-scale trade with the Soviet Union, but their total exports are still far below pre-war levels. Even if the countries can restore their previous export volume, the goods shipped to Western Europe will definitely be less than before. Eastern Europe is afraid of hindering its economy and will inevitably want to retreat completely. Because of the tense relations with the United States, the Soviet Union may turn to Western Europe to purchase machinery.

### Churchill Warns of Approaching Third World War

Soviet Union and Communist Party are Threatening the World

[United Press London Sixth Dispatch] British Conservative Party leader and wartime Prime Minister Churchill wrote to the party's parliamentary candidate Harris on the 6th, stating that every act of Soviet imperialism, communist violence, and conspiracy "is pushing the world step by step closer to a third world war." Churchill said that if Harris could win the Croton by-election, Europe and the United States would recognize this as "proof of the strength of Britain's moral purpose." Churchill also said: "Every man and woman, if they think about it, can see that we are all moving towards a terrifying situation at home and abroad. The recent developments may affect all of our party's domestic policies. Not only bankruptcy and poverty are approaching us in the British Isles, but every move of the Soviet Union also threatens the Third World War."

### British Engineer Predicts Future Planetary Warfare Countries Will Compete for Lunar Bases Launching Rocket Bombs at Earth

[Associated Press London Sixth Dispatch] The British Interplanetary Society's journal recently published a paper by member C.N. Clarke, imagining that future planetary wars will be more terrifying than atomic bombs. It is said that in the future, countries will compete for lunar bases. If such bases can manufacture fuel and other products, they can become the best bases for launching rocket bombs at the earth. Because the moon's gravity is smaller than the earth's, radiation is more convenient than on earth. In other words, anyone who first establishes a working base on the moon will be able to launch bigger and better bombs than any enemy on earth. Eventually, humans may take rockets to other planets to deal with enemies. Morally speaking, there is no difference between humans shooting arrows from a distance and killing each other with rockets from distant planets. Humans should find ways to prevent the realization of such planetary wars. A "transnational country" or a planetary exploration program jointly composed of large groups of countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union may be realized within fifty years, unless humans are hopelessly ignorant and indefinitely delay it. Such an organization may gradually carry out the following plans: (1) Build high-altitude rocket detectors that double or triple the current altitude record, and transport personnel; (2) Build manned airships that circumnavigate the moon without landing; (3) Build airships to carry humans to the moon, land and fly back; (4) Build long-range planetary navigation airships, which can use the moon as a refueling station to fly to more distant planets. Before the planetary exploration plan is implemented, it is necessary to use atomic energy for rocket propulsion. Clarke is currently an engineer at De Havilland Engineering Works, formerly a technician at De Havilland Aircraft Factory, and a member of the British Aviation Association.

### After the Meeting of the Three Party Leaders Today, the New Japanese Cabinet Will Be Formed The Democratic Party is Distributing the Number of Cabinet Seats

[Associated Press Tokyo Seventh Dispatch] Japanese Prime Minister-designate Hitoshi Ashida has decided to postpone the final plan for forming a cabinet until the afternoon of the 8th, when he will convene a second meeting with the leaders of the two friendly parties. However, it is believed that the new cabinet will take office on the 9th. Ashida visited outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida on the 7th and asked him to join the cabinet, but Yoshida refused. Later, when the leaders of the three parties met, Ashida again asked Katayama to serve as a cabinet member, but Katayama also refused. Some observers say that Ashida is eager to invite Katayama to join the cabinet because Katayama has a good reputation outside the cabinet, and once the left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party oppose the new government, only Katayama can be expected to stop this offensive. Ashida said that he will raise the old matter again to Katayama at the meeting of the leaders of the three parties at the end of the cow on the 8th. It is rumored that Ashida hopes that Katayama will serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is generally believed that Katayama will not accept. If so, Ashida will give up Katayama and proceed to form a cabinet. The leaders of Ashida's Democratic Party have been discussing the distribution of cabinet seats all week. Once Ashida decides to proceed without Katayama, it can be completed immediately. It is rumored that KDP Chairman Miki Takeo asked the KDP to obtain the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The new government will not be much different from the previous Katayama cabinet. Both are a coalition government of the SDP, DP, and KDP. The difference is that there must be at least left-wing socialists in the new government to reward the left-wing for their assistance in the showdown vote in the House of Representatives on February 21. Observers generally speculate that the new government is likely to die young due to its inability to curb inflation and deal with other economic problems.

### Full Text of London Conference Communiqué: Ruhr Internationalization Allows German Participation in Control, Land and Security Issues to be Discussed at Next Conference

[Reuters, London, 6th] Following the conclusion of the six-nation conference (Britain, United States, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) discussing the German problem, it was formally announced that an agreement had been reached on the policy of international control of the Ruhr area. It is generally agreed that this represents the most significant new progress in Western countries' handling of the German problem. However, its success or failure will depend on subsequent conferences of Western nations, including the five-nation Western European Union conference in Brussels and the sixteen-nation European conference in Paris. The policies agreed upon at the London Conference will be submitted to the governments of the six participating countries for approval. The official communiqué only stated that the recommendations concern the form and scope of the international control regime in the Ruhr, and that Germany may also participate in the control mechanism. Further details have not yet been revealed.

The communiqué issued after the conclusion of the London Conference also stated that the participating countries unanimously recognized the need for close economic relations between western Germany and Western Europe. It further stated that the French and Anglo-American zones in Germany should have appropriate representation in the permanent body handling European aid under the Marshall Plan. It also stated that land and security issues would be left for discussion at the next conference. Although the communiqué did not announce the merger of the French zone with the Anglo-American zone, it stated that "the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France have agreed to recommend to their respective governments that they engage in close cooperation on economic policies relating to foreign trade, transportation, and tariffs in the three zones, to the greatest extent possible."

Door Still Open to the Soviets

The full text of the communiqué, after detailing the delegations that participated in the various meetings since the London Conference began on February 23, further stated: "The conference has made significant progress and has decided that this discussion should continue in April to resolve the remaining issues, so that each participating delegation can submit to its respective government recommendations on the entire West German question, as agreed upon at the next conference. At the same time, the nature of some issues still requires more detailed review. The fact that the continuation of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference has not led to a Four Power agreement has created a situation in Germany which, if allowed to continue, will have unfortunate consequences for Western Europe. Therefore, the political and economic emergency problems arising from this situation must be resolved. The countries participating in this London Conference are deeply aware of the need to ensure the economic recovery of Western Europe (including Germany) and to establish a foundation for democratic Germany to participate in the group of free nations. Although the completion of this goal cannot be delayed any longer, the possibility of ultimately reaching a Four Power agreement has not been ruled out. All items on the agenda for this conference, except for security issues, have been studied in detail. Security issues have also been preliminarily reviewed and will be further studied in detail when the next conference resumes. The land issue will also be left for discussion at the next conference.

Ensuring Cooperation Among the Three Powers

"The representatives of the United States, France, and Britain discussed the parts of the German reparations problem related to the internal policies of the three occupation zones, and West Germany's relationship to the European Recovery Program. It was confirmed that for the political and economic welfare of Western European countries and democratic Germany, there should be close ties between the economic lives of Western European countries and democratic Germany. Furthermore, since the economic unification of Germany as a whole and East Germany's participation in the European Recovery Program have proven impossible, the United States, Britain, and France have agreed to maintain close cooperation among the three countries and in the three occupation zones of West Germany on issues related to the European Recovery Program. This cooperation is essential to enable West Germany to make a full contribution to the recovery of Europe. The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France also agreed that the Anglo-American zone and the French zone of West Germany should fully participate in the European Recovery Program and have appropriate representation in any permanent organization of the program. The representatives of the three countries will submit these recommendations to their respective governments and to the next meeting of the Committee of European Economic Cooperation.

Utilizing Ruhr Resources

"Regarding the participation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in policies towards Germany, an agreement in principle has been reached. The delegations have also considered the establishment of an international control regime for the Ruhr, in which Germany may also participate. The purpose of this international control regime is to ensure that the economic resources of the Ruhr are no longer used for aggression, and to enable a large part of Europe, including Germany, to benefit from the Ruhr's coal, steel, and coke production. Recommendations on the form and scope of authority of the international control regime will be submitted by the delegations of the participating countries to their respective governments.

Unifying German Politics and Economics

"The participating delegations also held concrete discussions on the current situation in Germany and the possible evolution of political and economic institutions in the Anglo-American and French zones of West Germany. Broad agreement was reached on a number of complex points. Of particular importance is that the participating delegations have agreed to confirm that a federal form of government, with appropriate central authority while providing appropriate protection for the rights of the states, is the most appropriate way to build German unity under the current circumstances.

"In order to facilitate West Germany's cooperation with the European Recovery Program, the United States, Britain, and France have agreed to take prompt action to coordinate, to the greatest extent possible, the economic policies of the three occupation zones of the United States, Britain, and France regarding foreign trade, transportation, and tariffs."

The leader of the British delegation was Mr. Strang, head of the German Department of the Foreign Office. The leader of the American delegation was Mr. Douglas, the American Ambassador to London. The leader of the French delegation was Mr. Massigli, the Ambassador to London.

Full View of 雷諾 Expedition Plane (Photo by This Newspaper)

[Report from This Newspaper] The 雷諾 Mount 積石 Expedition Team of seven people arrived in this city's 龍華 Airport yesterday afternoon at 3:20 PM on a special plane, the "Explorer". As the door opened, Mr. 雷諾 appeared first. He was wearing a light yellow camel hair coat, a dark brown felt hat, and looked energetic and smiled warmly, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with the welcomers.

According to 雷諾: the team took off from Chicago on February 29th and made several stops along the way to check the machinery and replenish supplies. The flight was very smooth all the way. However, the plane stopped overnight on Wake Island, where a fuel tank leak was discovered. Fortunately, it was on the ground and was repaired. The team took off from Guam at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning (Shanghai time) and flew directly to Shanghai without stopping along the way. The team flew continuously for nearly twelve hours before arriving safely in Shanghai. The team does not intend to stay in Shanghai for long. It is scheduled to fly directly to Nanjing at 9:30 AM on the 8th to meet with Chinese experts in Beijing, take the plane together to 闌, and begin its exploration and surveying work on Mount 積石. Afterwards, Lanzhou will be its work base. Once the mission is accomplished, the team will return to Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to participate in social events with various circles.

Mr. 雷諾's "Explorer" special plane is a C-87 four-engine military transport aircraft. The plane is silver. The name "Explorer" is written in blue paint on the nose, followed by "雷諾's Boston Museum China Expedition", "Pilot Orton", "Aviation Engineer Sally" and other words. On the small wings on both sides of the tail, the crossed flags of China and the United States are painted. Inside the cabin, in addition to three small rooms with seats, the rest of the space is occupied by scientific instruments and luggage for surveying and mapping, weighing as much as 30 tons.

The complete list of members of the 雷諾 Expedition Team was officially announced yesterday. It included nine American members: 雷諾, the team leader; scientific advisor 華士本 (Director of the Boston Museum, Mr. 華 has already come to Shanghai); pilot Orton; engineer Sally; historical expert 賴威 (also the director of the team's affairs, Mr. 賴 is the vice president of the 雷諾 pen company); geologist Dr. 葛四維 (Ohio State University); scientific instrument expert 麥 (Department of Aeronautics Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology); photography expert Ross (Optical Laboratory, Boston University); and liaison officer Yang Dize (Major Secretary of the US Army, who has already arrived in Shanghai).

There are a total of ten Chinese members: scientific advisor Zhang Geng (Professor, Central University); geologist Dr. Cheng Yuqi (Central Geological Survey); geographer Dr. Luo Kaifu (Geographical Research Institute of the Sino-British Cultural Foundation); geographer Professor Xu Jinzhi (Professor of Geography, Central University); geologist Sun Dianqing (Academia Sinica); Lai Xunyan (Representative of the Civil Aviation Administration); Major Rao Huihua (Military Liaison Director); Captain Hu Rongsheng; Lieutenant Li Lie; Lieutenant Zhu Chao (all of the above are military liaison officers).

Those who went to the airport to welcome Mr. 雷諾 yesterday included Zhang, the representative of Mayor Wu; Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the National Federation of Commercial Associations; and others. Also returning to China on Mr. 雷諾's "Explorer" special plane were Gu Weijun's second son, Gu Yuchang, and Wang Xiaolai's eldest daughter, Gong Qian Gu Wang Lianqing.

### National Federation of Industries: Important Resolutions: Urging the Government to Increase Coal Allocation, Reduce Prices of Reparation Machines, Considering Special Levies on Factories as Obstructing Production

[Report from This Newspaper] The National Federation of Industries held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday morning. More than twenty people attended, including Wu Yun Chu, Pan Yang Shan, Tao Gui Lin, Yin Zhi Zhong, Shen Si Fang, Rong Hong Yuan, Zhuang Zhi Huan, Hu Bo Xiang, Tian He Qing, Chu Feng Zhang, and Lin Ji Yong. It was chaired by Wu Yun Chu. In addition to reporting on recent federation affairs, the meeting discussed various important proposals and resolved the following important issues: (1) Promoting the establishment of industrial associations in various regions. (2) Coal allocated for electricity business operations is insufficient, and it is necessary to purchase supplementary coal on the black market, which increases the cost burden of industrial production. At the same time, power outages often occur due to insufficient coal, causing production to stop. The government is requested to increase coal allocation to ensure the necessary power for increased production. (3) Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced that the prices of Japanese reparations machines are extremely high, even exceeding the prices of ordering from Europe and the United States. Moreover, the application deadline is set for March 15th. The government should be requested to reduce the prices and extend the application deadline. At the same time, the machines must be unboxed first to allow factories applying to purchase them to inspect samples. (4) Regarding the government's regulation that profit tax is levied at six times the amount from last year, since the situation varies in each industry, it is impossible to make a rigid regulation. It should be reasonably assessed and paid by impartial members of the local industrial and commercial community. (5) It is reasonable for the government to announce a special levy for relief for both individuals and legal entities and to levy on wealthy households. However, it seems that levying on factory units obstructs production and should be exempted. (6) All quota allocations of raw materials for the fifth and sixth seasons should be entrusted to the industrial community for self-allocation so that raw materials are not lacking and to avoid exploitation by middlemen and reduce production costs. In addition to submitting these important resolutions to the competent authorities for adoption, Wu Yun Chu, Pan Yang Shan, Tao Gui Lin, Zhuang Zhi Huan, Yin Zhi Zhong, Shen Si Fang, and Li Cunting were appointed to go to Beijing to present their views to various agencies.

### Representatives of the Rubber Industry in 平津: Urging Increased Import Quotas

[Report from This Newspaper] The Rubber Industry Association of the Second District of Tianjin and the Rubber Industry Association of Peiping, in order to appeal for an increase in the import quota for raw rubber based on the actual needs of the factories in the two cities, and to allocate quotas for chemical raw materials, have specially dispatched three representatives. The Tianjin representatives are Pang Yongxuan (Manager of 振堂 Rubber Factory), Chairman of the Rubber Industry Association of the Second District of Tianjin, and Qiao Mingxun (Manager of 震 Rubber Factory). The Peiping representative is Tang Shaoyao (General Manager of 新華 Rubber Factory). They took a plane to Shanghai on the 6th and will visit the Export Management Committee authorities within days. According to the representatives, there are a total of 65 public and private rubber factories in Peiping and Tianjin. However, the quota allocated to the association in the past was US$120,000 in the second quarter, US$80,000 in the third quarter, and has been reduced to US$59,500 in the fourth quarter. With this amount of foreign exchange to order and import raw rubber, only over 160 tons, which is a very small amount when distributed to each factory. The foreign exchange quota in North China is generally insufficient, especially for rubber. If this continues, the rubber factories in Peiping and Tianjin will have to shut down. Furthermore, the rubber industry is a complex chemical industry with a large variety of required chemical raw materials. For those stipulated in the second category of quota items, the industry has not yet received a quota. They are coming to Shanghai this time to appeal for quota allocation as well.

### Representatives of 7 Cotton Merchants from 鄂: Requesting Loans to Purchase Cotton

Therefore, seven representatives, including Cheng Ziju, Li Jianting, and Wang Aqiong, were sent to Shanghai and went directly to the committee at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the principles with Deputy Director Zhu Suwu, and then presented the group's wishes to Chairman Yuan. They will also go to Beijing in the near future to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

### Smuggling of Rice and Grain in Wuxi: The Municipal Government Sends a Telegram Requesting a Ban

### Jade and Jewelry Industry Mistakenly Buys Stolen Goods: Requesting Correction of Handling Methods

The Jade and Jewelry Industry Association of this city, because its members often mistakenly receive stolen goods when buying various ornaments, has been deeply affected. The association recently sent representatives Cheng Fuxiang, Secretary-General Gu Yaotang, to the council to petition, expressing the hardships of the merchants, and requesting the correction of the handling methods. The original petition stated: "The crime of receiving stolen goods under the criminal law is established only if the recipient knowingly receives the goods. When merchants and the public buy goods, it is a legitimate act in the course of business. If they did not know beforehand that the goods were stolen, it is obviously not intentional, and there is no criminal liability under the law. If a mistake is made in buying stolen goods, it is obviously not intentional receipt, which is very clear. If the loser wants to recover the original item, they should reimburse the purchase price and prepare the funds. Moreover, jewelry and ornaments are mostly of considerable value, and good merchants seek profit from capital. It is difficult to bear unexpected losses. Therefore, when the police station extracts stolen goods, in addition to the shop owner being guaranteed by the association to be available at any time, a formal receipt should be issued so that the goods or price can be redeemed," and so on.

### Public Servants Suffering: The Municipal Government Appeals to the Central Government on Their Behalf: Requesting Restoration of Eight Dou of Rice Allocation

Regarding the problem of improving the treatment of public servants, Secretary-General Shen of the municipal government stated yesterday that in light of the current high prices, the municipal government has reported the difficulties of public servants to the central government. However, improving treatment is a national issue, and the central government is unable to raise it specially for Shanghai alone. Although the central government made adjustments to treatment from January of this year, calculated according to a public servant index of 85,000 times, the allocation of food rice has been reduced by five dou. The average increase per adjustment is only over 1 million yuan, and the reduction of five dou of food rice also reduces income by over 1 million yuan. In that case, the so-called adjustment is of no benefit. On the contrary, prices are rising step by step, and it is difficult for public servants to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the municipal government has now requested the central government to restore the food rice allocation to eight dou. In addition, the municipal government also plans to conduct various welfare facilities for employees, such as issuing medical expenses for employees who are ill.

The Municipal Treasury Is Not Well-Funded: Difficult to Allocate Funds for Subsidies First

When the reporter further inquired whether the municipal government could provide subsidies before the central government made reasonable adjustments to the treatment of public servants, Mr. Shen stated that the municipal treasury is not well-funded and the revenue and expenditure are still difficult to balance. It is impossible to allocate additional funds for subsidies, and it is also difficult for the audit office to approve the receipt of funds because it is not included in the budget.

The donations from the issuance of house charity sale tickets are not included.

The reason is that an enemy merchant, Wan Zhaoyang Firm, had sent a large number of flour soap items to the Cotton Cloth Bank for mortgage. After the victory, Ding actually attempted to embezzle them, falsely claiming that a forged 100 million yuan Central Reserve Note check was issued to Wan Zhaoyang Firm on July 31, 1945, so the assets had actually been purchased. When the relevant authorities investigated, Ding forged the official documents of the Liquidation Office of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank to prove that this was indeed the case. However, when the relevant authorities further investigated with the Liquidation Office of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, they learned that they were all forged. The Ministry of Finance, based on the report, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Employees of Four Banks and Two Bureaus Demand Salary Adjustment; Collective Sit-In Possible Today if No Satisfactory Resolution Is Reached

Employees of the city's four banks and two bureaus are demanding salary adjustments. If the bank and bureau authorities do not provide a reasonable response today, action may be taken. All employees of the banks and bureaus jointly signed a letter on the 1st of this month, making three demands: (1) After the salaries of the banks and bureaus' employees are calculated according to the treatment of public education personnel, the base salary should be adjusted to the standard of civil servants. (2) After the unreasonable cancellation of the public education differential subsidy, the banks and bureaus should issue one dan of rice to compensate for the insufficient living expenses of employees. (3) The income of workers is low, and the bank and bureau should subsidize the education expenses of their children. It is reported that the bank and bureau authorities have accepted and are considering the third item regarding subsidizing the education expenses of workers' children, but the first and second items have not yet been decided. According to sources within the banks and bureaus: If the bank and bureau authorities do not provide a satisfactory resolution today, all employees of the four banks and two bureaus and their branches will hold a sit-in in their offices after work until dawn.

(2) The differential subsidy for public education personnel has been canceled for no reason.

### Two-landlord Era Darlings Emerge from Housing Shortage; One Street-crossing Room Demands 80 Million; Real Estate Brokers Spring Up Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The severity of Shanghai's current housing shortage has reached its peak. After the announcement of the charity housing lottery results, the envy, joy, and disappointment expressed in the minds of the vast majority of citizens were even more profound than the anticipation of the huge sums of money from the aviation lottery ten years ago. The excessive concentration of the urban population has turned originally spacious and clean alleys into snack streets, and the originally quiet and dust-free roadsides have added many grass sheds to provide shelter from the wind and rain; courtyards have been converted into front buildings, attics have been added on top of front buildings, and side rooms have been divided into three; cooking causes smoke to fill the air, lingering all day long, and the cries of children can be heard by several households. In this environment where even air and sunlight have become scarce treasures, the continuous occurrence of theft, epidemics, adultery, and fires is certainly beyond human prevention.

Speaking is as firm as a mountain, with no compromise

Because vacant land is as valuable as gold, people who own real estate have become the darlings of the times. Although their authority over renting and transferring has largely fallen into the hands of two-landlords, their value is increasing daily with the rise in prices. As for the title of two-landlord, it now looks down upon all other occupations. Other occupations can ask for the sky-high price and be bargained to the ground, but the two-landlord speaks as firmly as a mountain, with no compromise. If you look at a house in the morning, the two-landlord will ask for two gold bars, and you must first pay a deposit of 20%. If you hesitate, and go back in the evening, either the house has already been transferred, or the price has increased by another 10%. A civil servant recently went to see a house that only had one room above the street, and the two-landlord asked for 80 million. The civil servant said he would discuss it with his wife and decide. He went back to the same place that night, and the two-landlord was in the middle of a heated mahjong game. Before the civil servant could speak, the two-landlord waved his hands and said, "Not renting it!" The civil servant then claimed that he was willing to accept the price, but the two-landlord lowered his face and said, "I won't rent it even if you offer 80 million!" Then he began to lecture him: "You're so indecisive, annoying!"

One side room, divided into three

The power of the two-landlords has quickly infected people who have spare rooms. During the Lunar New Year, many middle and upper-class families visited each other, and after congratulating each other, they would say: "You'll be a two-landlord this year!" Complimenting someone as a two-landlord has become a flattering remark, so how could the two-landlords not rise like wind and clouds? Not to mention those with many spare rooms, even families with only one side room hire workers to divide it into three, calling it the front room, middle room, and back room. They live in the front room themselves, and rent out the middle and back rooms. If each room doesn't have good facilities, it can still be rented for 100 million per room at the current price, and 200 million can be made instantly. While the two-tenant becomes a two-landlord and makes a large profit, it is pitiful for the small tenant who has exhausted all efforts just to have a place to live. Beforehand, they scrounge and scrape together money, burdened with debt. Afterwards, they live in a tiny room, gradually wearing away and crushing their lives in the darkness, dampness, and noise.

Panic buying, Many Transactions

Some say that Shanghai's housing shortage is serious, but it is real and unreal at the same time, because apart from the unreachable likes of Kiessling & Bader, the Racecourse, and the Foreign Cemetery, there are still countless "magnificent buildings" with deeply locked doors and no signs of life. Others believe that on an ordinary street, there is bound to be at least one vacant house within ten steps. How can this be seen? They say that the rental classified ads in the newspapers, which are updated daily, and the transaction records of nearly a thousand real estate brokers throughout the city, can all serve as the most detailed proof.

Negotiating, Charging According to the Person

Speaking of real estate brokers, this is another one of the most profitable occupations that has emerged in recent years. At the time of the victory, the scope of activities of these people was limited to "Spring Breeze Triumphant Building," because of concerns about prohibitions, the number of people engaged in the industry was limited. But today, following the flow of hot money or carrying the fate of being persecuted, people from northern Jiangsu, northern China, and Sichuan, Yunnan, and southern China have flocked to Shanghai, the urgency of finding a house may even be greater than finding a job. But in a strange land, the relationship between housing supply and demand may not be smooth, so they happily appeared in the middle of this; negotiating, charging according to the person. Although it is stated that they only take a 10% commission, transactions come in droves, a large sum every three days, a small sum every two days, and after months of operation, the foundation is established.

### Living Labels, Replacing Advertisements

Because business is booming, most of the brokers from the "Spring Breeze Triumphant Building" era have opened specialized companies, becoming the leaders in the industry. Where there is profit, who is willing to fall behind – real estate brokers have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain in the past six months, attracting customers in groups; some have changed careers from doctors and grain merchants, while others are operating as old goods stores and cigarette paper shops. In addition to setting up institutions to direct and coordinate, they also send mobile personnel to solicit and negotiate, wearing a cap and dressed in short clothing, like "yellow cattle" selling black market tickets in front of a theater. These living labels have replaced the red rental advertisements that were all over the streets and alleys a few years ago.

### Heinous Bloodbath Discovered in Kunming: Wife Kills Husband, Son Murders Father, Brother Kills Sister; Murderer Cao Xincheng on the Run; Great Tragedy of Property Seizure Discovered From Two Girls' Corpses

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 7th] On February 27th, two girls' bodies were discovered in the eastern suburbs of Kunming, having been hacked to death. Their clothes resembled those of primary school students, and they appeared to be sisters. A blunt axe and miscellaneous items such as pens and inks were left next to the bodies. A badge with the words "Wenzhong" was found on one of the bodies. The incident caused a city-wide sensation, but no one came to claim them. After ten days of investigation by the City Police Department, the case has been solved. It turns out to be a heinous family bloodbath of "wife killing husband, son murdering father, brother killing sister." The two girls' father and stepmother were also murdered. The police cracked the case based on the "Wenzhong" badge. They found out that there was a Wenzhong Elementary School in Baoshan County and sent officers to investigate. It was confirmed to be the school badge, and it was identified by the daughter of Wang Zhengnong, a resident in the city. Wang was from Baoshan and had considerable wealth. He had a wife and a concubine. The wife, Ms. Li, was in her forties and had a son named Xirong, who did not pursue a proper career. The concubine, Ms. Ji, had two daughters named Xilu and Xihou, who were the ones murdered in the Kunming suburbs. When the detectives arrived at Wang's house, they discovered that Wang Zhengnong had disappeared. Only Wang's wife, Ms. Li, was at home. She spoke evasively. After being detained and interrogated, she confessed that there was discord between the wife and concubine in the family. Li and her son Xirong plotted to seize the family property. They colluded with Cao Xincheng, Wang's sister's husband, who had served as the Chief of the Materials Section of the Ordnance Maintenance Training Class of the Ministry of Military Affairs. They first hacked Wang Zhengnong and Ms. Ji to death in mid-February and buried the bodies in Cao's garden. On February 20th, Cao took the two daughters to Kunming and killed them to carry out the conspiracy to divide the family property. Cao is on the run, and Cao's wife, Ms. Wang, has also been detained.

### Travelogue of Shanxi (3): Overcoming Disaster and Reducing Food Consumption

Twelve years ago, Shanxi began to sing the "Anti-Communist Song" written by Yan Xishan himself: "The Communist Party deceives people in three stages, sweet first, then bitter, don't be deceived. The first stage is buying you over, giving you small favors, distributing grain and land to make you happy. The second stage is forced, your wealth is not up to you, men become Red Guards, women become comfort women, parents, wives, and children are permanently separated. The third stage is shocking and bloody, if you don't do as they say, you will be killed without a doubt, either to fill the cannon eyes or to be hacked to death with knives, the communists in Jiangxi and Shaanxi kill people like ants. The communist bandits used the money of people, the land of landlords, and the lives of poor people as capital to rob the regime today, launching a ruthless and unparalleled full-scale rebellion, causing famine!" During the nationwide price surge in May last year, Taiyuan proposed a method that did not involve any profound economic principles in response to the reality – "People's Economy." It aimed to simplify life, protect life, allocate work, and distribute property to overcome the difficulties of the communist bandits.

Simplifying Life

Simplifying life seeks "equality" and "stability." Apart from soldiers who can eat half millet and half wheat for their top-grade meals, everyone else, regardless of official, civilian, rich, or poor, eats second-grade meals – wheat for two days, refined grains (including millet, bean noodles, buckwheat, etc.) for eight days, and coarse grains (including corn, sorghum, barley, etc.) for twenty days. Each person is allowed half a pound of salt per month, and those with small appetites get half that. Each person is allowed to buy no more than flower cloth worth four yuan in the old currency per year. The so-called old currency is also a new term, but it is not a currency. It is just a conceptual conversion standard based on comparing the price of a bolt of No. 3 cloth during the Anti-Japanese War with the price of a bolt of No. 3 cloth now to find an index, and using this index as a measure for exchanging agricultural products. Restaurants are also graded. The three "banquet" restaurants are specially for receiving foreign guests and are allowed to sell high-end food. The seven "social" restaurants are for weddings and funerals, and the rest are all people's canteens.

Protecting Life

The agency that implements the People's Economy policy is the "People's Economy Implementation Committee." In "protecting life," it stipulates that the income of farmers, workers, and merchants must be equal. At the same time, it registers the unemployed and is responsible for allocating work. As for "distributing property," the scope is very broad. It executes the exchange of industrial products and agricultural products within the province, as well as the exchange of raw materials and daily necessities from other provinces for the province's products. However, in the former case, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement strictly distinguishes between the country and the country's enemies, and the distribution of materials is also clear. Absorbing food from the bandit areas is out of the question. As for the government-controlled areas, they have reached the end of their rope. In the latter case, Chennault's air transport team is the only means of transportation, but the freight cost of hundreds of millions of old currency per ton is truly unbearable.

The shops in Taiyuan are all crying out in pain. Under the strict control of unified procurement, they can no longer play their wishful thinking. Many stores are still piled with countless foreign wines and canned goods, but who can afford such high prices. Although there are free markets, they are limited to food and daily necessities.

Spring Couplets in the City

The People's Economy Implementation Committee is run by 18 members elected from all walks of life, including farmers, workers, merchants, self-defense forces, and women. However, there are also neighborhood meetings, which are held weekly. Only matters passed in the neighborhood meetings can be implemented. This method allows the spirit of democracy to be developed to a high degree. However, when I was at Jinci, I saw a limerick on the wall: "The sky is level, but the ground is not level, the water is level, but the mountain is not level, people are equal, but the heart is not equal, nine out of ten people are not equal." I heard that there is also this spring couplet in Taiyuan: "People celebrate the New Year with two ups and eight downs (describing the hand gestures of making dumplings), we welcome spring with nine outs and one in (describing the hand gestures of making corn buns)," and the horizontal scroll is "People's Economy." In this day and age, I am afraid that nothing is harder to achieve than "equality."

The Shanxi authorities recognize that the "People's Economy" has been generally effective in the past eight months, but now General Yan sighs: "Today, the problem of food in Shanxi is not a question of price, but of whether there is any at all. We have now moved from the distribution stage of the People's Economy to the famine relief stage."

Famine Relief

The reason for the severe food shortage in Jinzhong is the severe drought last spring and summer, with a harvest of only 30% to 40% of a normal year. On the other hand, the refugees after the communist bandits' "settling old accounts" and the old and weak women and children "driven" into Shanxi have added a burden of more than 600,000 people to the isolated island of Jinzhong. It is estimated that at least half of the counties in Jinzhong will be short of food for three months this spring. In order to overcome the disaster and reduce food consumption, General Yan issued a painful "Letter to the People of Jinzhong": "We only have two ways to reduce food consumption ourselves and hope for central relief, and aircraft to transport food. But asking the government to transport by plane is also a difficult matter and cannot be hoped for too extravagantly. Today, we focus on the people's food conservation." "I am temporarily planning to divide the food for at least four people into five people's meals, which means dividing the food for one person for four days into five days." "It is easy to divide food today, but it will be difficult to run out of food in the future."

Loans to Purchase Food

The prices in Taiyuan are so high: 7 million yuan for a dan of wheat, 40,000 yuan for a jin of sorghum, and 3.5 million yuan for a bag of flour. Will the tragic scene of people starving to death next to piles of silver treasures in Guangxu three years occur again in Shanxi? Otherwise, the reporter would not have heard this appeal: "Please allow the people of Taiyuan and other cities to mortgage all their property, houses, factories, etc., to borrow loans at home and abroad to purchase and transport food to relieve the famine!"

Ruthless Rails
A couple takes their own lives
The baby in the womb dies simultaneously

[Report from our Tianjin correspondent on the 3rd] At noon on the 3rd, a tragic incident occurred between the Beining Railway's main station and the east station, where a young couple committed suicide by lying on the tracks. This is exactly one month after Huang Wenxiang and Ma Fenghua committed suicide by lying on the tracks due to marital discord. The protagonists of this new tragedy are the man, named An Yusheng, 25 years old, from Tianjin, and the woman, his wife, Mrs. An Yang, 28 years old. Mrs. Yang was pregnant with a fetus of about four or five months. The young couple and the unborn baby died together under the ruthless iron wheels. As for the cause of the suicide, the authorities are investigating.

It is said that the people and the land are in harmony; the future achievements can certainly be imagined.

Various Measures
Implemented One After Another

In addition to personnel decisions, various measures related to the entire suppression plan have also been implemented one after another. The main ones are roughly these: (1) Increasing the number of security police groups by five; (2) Improving the salaries of the original ten security police groups and the security police teams in various counties; (3) Organizing and training local civilian armed forces to strictly carry out the work of clearing the countryside; (4) Incorporating stray and miscellaneous troops; (5) Strengthening transportation facilities, including emergency telephone lines in relevant counties. As for the implementation of the suppression, the principle is "30% military, 70% political," implementing both pacification and suppression. For bandits who surrender and reform, proper arrangements will be made, either by assigning them tasks of suppressing bandits, enabling them to participate in production work, or sending them back to their hometowns to resume their original occupations. In short, the procedures for amnesty are simplified, and the conditions for self-renewal are lenient. As long as they sincerely return, they will not be held accountable for past offenses.

In late January this year, the Guangdong Provincial Police and Security Department convened another reorganization meeting, attended by commanders from various districts and the chiefs of the police and security corps. This meeting made important decisions regarding the finances, equipment, and supplies of the troops in various districts throughout the province.

Within Three Months
Eliminating Bandit Atmosphere
After all the deployments were properly arranged, the authorities launched a spring anti-bandit campaign, preparing to concentrate military force to encircle and annihilate the main bandit forces in various districts within three months, and then use civilian armed forces to clear the countryside and defend themselves, so as to thoroughly eliminate the bandit atmosphere. Although this plan was launched in late February, since the establishment of the anti-bandit command headquarters in various districts, many local bandits have been defeated, and under the combination of pacification and suppression, there have been even more people carrying weapons to surrender and reform. According to the results of the anti-bandit campaign in the province from January to February 15, announced by the headquarters, a total of 2,140 bandits were killed, 1,558 bandits were captured, and 1,368 bandits surrendered and reformed, totaling 5,066 people. If the total number of bandits in the province is 30,000, as mentioned in the above statistics, this has weakened their strength by more than 16%. This is even before the start of the grand anti-bandit campaign plan, so the fate of the Guangdong bandits after the launch of this spring anti-bandit offensive can be imagined.

The Group A football league, which had been suspended for more than a month, continued yesterday. Eastern China faced Qingbai at Yiyuan, with more than 2,000 spectators, which was still enthusiastic. Eastern China, with the help of Xie Jinhong, who had just come to Shanghai from Hong Kong, greatly increased its strength. As a result of the competition, Eastern China lived up to expectations and easily defeated Qingbai by a score of 5 to 1. The score was 2 to 1 in the first half. Qingbai fought bravely and had a great spirit. The referee was Zhang Le, and the linesmen were Wu Shouheng and Chen Jixiang.

Sets a Record

Eastern China attacked first, and Xia Tixian took the lead, shooting from afar, but the ball fell into the wilderness. Qingbai's right forward, Jiang Yueqing, drove straight in, greatly hindering the attack, but he used too little force, and the ball was caught by Banglun. Eastern China's offensive was strong, and Qingbai's hinterland was filled with cavalry. Jiawan lightly passed the ball into Liu Xianhan's arms. Longhai's header also became a wild ball. Chen Mingzhe stirred up another wave, and the ball fell into Qingbai's penalty area. Xie Jinhong scrambled up and headed the ball into the net from the right corner. Eastern China took a 1-0 lead, 11 minutes after the start of the game. At 30 minutes, Longhai received a pass from Jinhong and broke in through a gap. Liu Xianhan fell to the ground in advance, and the ball went into the net again, making it 2-0. Qingbai counterattacked, but they lacked the strength to do so. It was not until the last half minute of the first half that Qingbai's Jing Linggui pulled back a goal. At the end of the first half, Eastern China led 2-1.

Three goals in the second half, After the break, Qingbai's goalkeeper was replaced by Huang Shijie. Eastern China became more and more courageous, and the Qingbai youngsters were caught in a bitter battle. At nine minutes, Longhai shot fiercely from the twelve-yard spot, right in the middle, and rolled straight into Qingbai's goal, making it 3-1. One minute later, General Han revisited the old place. Huang Shijie rushed out in a hurry, right in the middle of Longhai's trap, and jumped up with one foot. Qingbai lost another city, 4-1. After that, the battle situation was that Eastern China did not take advantage of its foundation and defended more than attacked. Although Qingbai tried to cheer up, they could not come up with any good ideas. In the fierce battle until 44 minutes, Longhai penetrated alone, and Qingbai's Fu Natang desperately protected the goal and committed a foul in the penalty area. Xia Tixian took the penalty kick and scored a goal, and the entire game ended with a score of 5-1. Eastern China had four wins in four games, remaining undefeated.

Weekly Economic Overview of Prices
Food Prices Relatively Stable
Chemicals and Textiles Second

Last week was the first week of March. In the two weeks prior to that, which were the first two weeks after the Lunar New Year, prices had already undergone a period of drastic fluctuation. This fluctuation was extremely fierce and was the first major price cycle fluctuation of the year. During this fluctuation, food, textiles, and chemicals rose the fastest. According to the wholesale price index classified by commodity use compiled by this association, food rose by 71% in the two weeks, chemicals rose by 65% in the same period, textiles rose by 53%, and fuels and building materials rose less. The overall price index rose by 42%.

After these two weeks of sharp price increases, the money market began to tighten at the beginning of last week, and it seemed that this price fluctuation would reach a pause. Originally, the alternating rise and fall of prices, and the alternating relaxation and tightening of the money market, are unavoidable phenomena in the late stage of inflation. To use an analogy, society is like a water storage container, currency is like the water in the container, and the size of the container symbolizes the level of prices. The level of water in the container symbolizes the tightness of the money market. When more water flows into the container than flows out, the water level gradually rises, which means that the money market gradually relaxes. When the container is full, it means that the money market is extremely relaxed. If more water continues to flow in than flows out, the old container will inevitably not be able to accommodate so much water, so the container must be renewed, and its volume must be expanded, which means that the price level will inevitably rise. In the new container, because the capacity is expanded, the old amount of water has not changed, but the water level has been greatly reduced, which means that the money market has tightened again. After that, if the inflow still exceeds the outflow, the above process will be repeated again, cycling endlessly. Prices rise and fall alternately, and the money market relaxes and tightens alternately. But as long as the inflow continues to exceed the outflow, the volume of the container will always gradually expand.

At the beginning of last week, due to the sharp rise in prices in the previous two weeks, the money market tightened, and the prices of all commodities fell back. For example, top-quality white rice fell from 3 million per shi at the end of the previous week to 2.8 million on Monday of last week. Military ship wheat flour fell from 1.32 million per bag to 1.24 million in the same period. 42-count Blue Phoenix fell from 130 million per piece to 103 million. Arrow brand soap fell from 3.77 million per box to 3.6 million. However, the tightening of the money market did not last for two days before it turned to relaxation. The reasons for this will be discussed in the currency and finance section below. As a result, the prices of all commodities rebounded, and this rebound broke the expectation that the price fluctuation at the beginning of the week would temporarily enter a period of respite. Moreover, the rebound continued to increase. Although the money market tightened again at the weekend, the price increase still did not stop. The food market fell into a state of madness again. White rice rose to 3.4 million, 42-count Blue Phoenix rose to 130 million. What is even more alarming is the factory silk. Grade B 83 evenness white factory silk rose from 164 million on Monday to 200 million at the weekend. The prices of all commodities showed new highs, with only chemicals being relatively stable. It is hoped that the money market will be tightened quickly next week, otherwise the price increase at the weekend is likely to spread. The wise financial authorities must have been aware of this and made preparations in advance. The wholesale price index classified by use for last week is as follows:

Category Name Last Week's Index Percentage Change from Previous Week
Food 275,870 Up 6.5%
Textiles 351,630 Up 11.0%
Fuel 342,850 Up 13.3%
Metals 305,190 Up 30.8%
Building Materials 333,160 Up 14.7%
Chemicals 553,148 Up 3.9%
Miscellaneous 300,730 Up 6.9%
Overall Index 330,750 Up 10.9%

The wholesale price index classified by the degree of processing for last week is as follows:

Category Name Last Week's Index Percentage Change from Previous Week (Raw Materials)
Food Plant Products 275,870 Up 6.5%
Non-Food Plant Products 218,340 Up 6.4%
Animal Products 167,025 Up 0.9%
Mineral Products 334,140 Up 24.8%
Overall Index for this Category 239,900 Up 6.3%

(Manufactured Goods)
Intermediate Products 458,783 Up 11.6%
Consumer Goods 375,620 Up

### Pacifying Guangdong Province: A Comprehensive Sweep Begins

[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, This Newspaper, 4th] Guangdong Province is rich in resources and currently relatively stable, truly an ideal location for developing its economy. Since Song Ziwen took charge of Guangdong, everyone has cast optimistic eyes on South China's economic construction. Overseas Chinese and foreign businesses, in particular, view Guangdong as fertile ground for investment. We foresee a bright and splendid future for Guangdong's economic development. However, we cannot ignore the issue of local pacification, as unrest is the greatest obstacle to current construction. Therefore, although Song Ziwen has well-laid plans for economic development, observing the actual situation, he cannot but recognize "security first." To build a new Guangdong, eliminating banditry is a prerequisite.

Thirty Thousand Strong, Bandits Account for Half

According to recent statistics from the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, the total number of bandits in the province is approximately 30,000. They are distributed as follows: about 5,000 in the Dongjiang area, over 1,600 in the Hanjiang area, over 8,000 in the southern Guangdong area, about 600 in the Pearl River area, over 2,300 in the Xijiang area, over 4,800 in the Beijiang area, and over 6,500 in the Qiongyai area. They harass various parts of Guangdong under the names of "People's Liberation Army" and "Democratic Allied Army." Observing their actions and intentions, it is clear they aim to undermine our grassroots political organizations, disrupt our rear areas, and tie down Nationalist forces. Recently, the Communists declared they would cross the Yangtze River in May, hoping to merge with South China to create a large impression of their strength. From this, it is clear that the Communist plot to destroy South China is considerable. Moreover, even the 30,000 estimated by the Pacification Headquarters is by no means a small number. Isn't that terrifying? But the reality is not quite so. Among these so-called 30,000, the number of true Communists is probably limited, while local thugs and ruffians make up the majority. Most of these bandits are driven to banditry by rural bankruptcy and difficult living conditions, forcing them to take risks, form gangs, and engage in robbery. However, the Communists incite and collude with them, mutually exploiting each other, using their strength to harass various places and create a grand impression of strength. The bandits, on the other hand, use the Communist banner to enhance their reputation and achieve their goals of seizing wealth and goods. Therefore, while such a disorganized rabble is more than capable of harming the locality and undermining government construction, it would be an overestimation to say they are capable of large-scale political rebellion.

Redeployment, Comprehensive Suppression

The Guangdong provincial authorities' plan for suppressing bandits has been redeployed since the Guangdong-Guangxi Pacification Conference was held in Guangzhou last winter, deciding to implement a comprehensive suppression. The province is divided into eight suppression zones, followed by pacification by zone. The commanders of these eight zones were carefully selected by Chairman Song. As a result, Generals He Tong, Ye Zhao, Chen Wenzhao, Zhang Guangqiong, Yu Yingqi, Zhu Juzhi, Liu Qikuan, and Zhang Ruigui were chosen to serve as commissioners and commanders of Zones 1 through 8, respectively. Subsequently, two border area suppression headquarters were established for Guangdong-Hunan-Jiangxi and Guangdong-Fujian. The former was headed by Ye Zhao as commander-in-chief, with Mo Xiongsheng filling Ye's original vacancy as commander of the Second Zone. The latter was headed by Tu Sizong as commander-in-chief, with Chen Quan as his deputy.
