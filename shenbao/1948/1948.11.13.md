### Another Great Victory on the Outskirts of Xuzhou: Eastern Flank National Army Annihilates 37,000 Bandits; Chen Yi's Nine Columns Routed

[Urgent Telegram from Central News Agency, Xuzhou Front Station, 1:30 PM, 12th] Military News: The bandit Chen Yi, with a force of more than nine columns, launched an offensive against the positions of Huang Baitao's army corps in Nianzhuang and Bayiji to the east of Xuzhou. From the evening of the 10th, fierce fighting continued until 5:00 AM this morning. The bandits employed human wave tactics, charging more than twenty times each night, but were ultimately bravely repulsed by our forces. In two days and nights, the bandits and our troops engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat, advancing and retreating without a moment's respite. More than ten thousand bandit corpses were left in front of our lines. By the afternoon of the 11th, our large air force formations, in coordination, heavily bombed the bandit artillery positions and fortifications, destroying 70 percent of them. The National Army then seized the opportunity to launch a brave and fierce attack. As of 5:00 AM this morning, more than 4,000 bandits had been disarmed by our forces. It has now been confirmed that the bandit's 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 7th, New 8th, 9th, 11th, and 12th Columns, along with the Huaihai and Huaibei Independent Brigades, a total of over 160,000 men, have all participated in the fighting on this front. In the past three days of combat, the bandits have suffered more than 37,000 casualties, marking an unprecedented great victory in the Xuzhou campaign.

[Urgent Telegram from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 2:00 PM, 12th] After our Huang Corps achieved a glorious victory this morning by completely routing the bandit forces of more than nine columns on the entire Nianzhuang and Bayiji line, the bandit momentum faltered, and although they attempted to attack again, their sharp edge was greatly diminished. Currently, our morale is high, and the people of Xuzhou are extremely excited. There will be even greater progress in the peripheral battles. The eight columns of bandits under the combined forces of Liu and Chen (Yi) on the western front, after suffering heavy blows on the Jieshan and Huangkou lines in recent days, have now avoided a frontal confrontation and dare not engage our main forces in a decisive battle. At present, in addition to the four columns of bandits gathering between Dangshan and Huangkou, Chen Yi's 3rd and Liangguang Columns are now scattered near Yongcheng, and Liu's 3rd and 9th Columns are now scattered near Linhuanji, southeast of Yongcheng, attempting to threaten the flanks and rear of the National Army on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. However, our forces in the Suxian area are strong, and if the bandits attempt to attack from the flanks, they will inevitably suffer heavy blows. At the same time, the people of various counties in the Funiu Mountain area of western Henan and the local militias of Wanxi have also risen up in response. The former military region units of the bandits in the counties west and north of Nanyang, which were originally our local militias forcibly reorganized, have now jointly revolted, and by the 8th, the number of people had reached more than 7,000, creating a very large momentum. In the past two days, our local militias have launched widespread attacks, seizing 1,185 bandit rifles, 11 light machine guns, 3 heavy machine guns, 17,000 jin of grain, more than 700 sets of cotton uniforms, and a large quantity of other military supplies.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] The Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters announced: A strong corps of the National Army advancing west of the Grand Canal has launched a counterattack against the bandits, recovering dozens of villages such as Wuzhuang and Qinjialou, and annihilating more than 5,000 men from Ye Fei's First Corps of bandits in the Qianhou Wuzhuang area northwest of Nianzhuang.

### Northeastern National Army All Arrives at Designated Locations; Defenses Between Tianjin and Yuzhou Further Consolidated; Unprecedentedly Strong Force; Jidong Absolutely Safe from Worry

[This Newspaper, Tangshan, 12th] After the end of the Northeast war, communist bandits have been entering the pass in a steady stream, and although their traces have been frequently reported, there has been no action. According to military authorities who spoke to reporters: The National Army that withdrew from the Northeast has arrived at its designated locations. Currently, large armies are gathered in Qinhuangdao and Yuguan, and strong troops have been added to the Tianjin-Yuzhou line. The force is stronger than ever before, so Jidong can be guaranteed to be safe from worry. Moreover, with the outbreak of the major battle in East China, the defense of Taiyuan, and the rumors of bandit harassment in Chahar and Suiyuan, the communist bandits' attempt to infiltrate Jidong is for the purpose of supplementing troop strength and provisions, and to use the route to reinforce another battlefield. As for launching a war in Jidong, it is feared that they currently do not have the strength.

(4) Telecommunications between Tianjin and Tangshan were temporarily disrupted yesterday but have been restored.

### The Current Serious Situation is Not a Crisis But an Opportunity; Fu Zuoyi's Speech at the Commemoration of Sun Yat-sen's Birthday

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] At the Beiping Commemoration of Sun Yat-sen's 83rd Birthday, Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi said in his speech: "Today is the 83rd anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birthday. When we commemorate Sun Yat-sen, we are truly filled with endless shame. We have been revolutionizing for decades, and to this day we have not been able to fully realize Sun Yat-sen's principles. The people's livelihood is declining, and the nation's destiny is in peril. Just thinking about this fills us with immeasurable emotion.

Everyone in North China now feels a serious threat. Due to the changes in the Northeast war situation, the enemies from the Northeast will be added to North China, increasing the pressure on North China. We must examine whether the military setbacks in the Northeast were defeats. We can only say that they were due to our own internal disorder, and they cannot prove that the communist bandits are formidable. Since the communist rebellion, our military setbacks and political failures are indeed facts, but they have all failed due to our own corruption and incompetence, which has allowed the communist bandits to gain temporary local advantages. The communist bandits were able to defeat corruption and incompetence because corruption and incompetence should fail. If someone fights, they will fail. If no one fights, they will also fail. However, the communist bandits' totalitarian terror and cruelty can never defeat our ideals of democracy, freedom, and peace. Under the current situation, looking forward to the future of North China, I believe that it is not so much a crisis as it is an opportunity. We currently have difficulties, but we have even greater confidence in overcoming these difficulties and getting through them. From countless painful and bloody facts, the people of North China have already raised their awareness. They have a truly deep understanding of the problem and know for sure that today's suppression of rebellion in China is not a simple ordinary civil war, not a struggle for political power, and even less should it be to protect the wealthy and privileged. Rather, it is a struggle between two different ways of life: the people's livelihood, freedom, and peace versus totalitarian terror and cruelty. Only with the success of the suppression of rebellion will the Chinese people have democracy and freedom, be able to enjoy the rights of citizens in an independent and autonomous country, be able to continue our good cultural traditions, ethical morality, harmonious family life, and freedom of religious belief. If the communist bandits rule China, the Chinese people will no longer have democracy or freedom. They will confine the Chinese people behind an iron curtain, plunging them into totalitarian tyranny, cruelty, terror, and endless war. The communist bandits have recently been promoting that they can stop liquidation and struggle in some places, expressing their so-called "lenient policy." However, the people of North China know the true situation in the bandit areas all too well. They will never forget the cruelty of the communist bandits' liquidation and struggle, and they can also see through the communist bandits' propaganda of stopping liquidation and struggle as a poisonous trick and a deception. The communist bandits' own history is the best proof. The communist bandits' background and the set of strategies they have inherited and learned are enough to show that the communist bandits' so-called "lenient policy" is only a short-term exploitation and means. The longer the communist bandits have ruled a place, the deeper the people's suffering, the greater their hatred of the bandits, and the more thoroughly they know the true face of the communist bandits. Correct understanding will become powerful action. The more serious the situation, the more concentrated the will of the people of North China. The more arduous the task, the stronger our strength.

I dare to say that the vast majority of the National Army in North China is not corrupt. They all have a purpose, an ideal, and are sacrificing and struggling for the principles and for the people. They have no demands for themselves. Precisely because of this, they eat the coarsest food, wear the worst clothes, walk the most difficult roads, and fight the most intense battles. They are never despondent, never disappointed. The various units are full of a spirit of coordination, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation, and they can often automatically support and fulfill the requirements of the common whole. In the recent Northeast campaign, if the friendly forces had been able to support each other according to plan, it would not only not have been a defeat, but it would have been a great victory. We can say with certainty that officers who are for enjoyment and for themselves will inevitably fail, while armies that are for principles, for the people, and have a purpose and an ideal will inevitably succeed and win."

We eagerly await your banners and sing your praises. The people of the whole country pledge to be your support.

### The Executive Yuan Convenes a Meeting of Provincial Governors and Mayors; Conference to be Held Today in Nanjing; Discussions on Total War and Dredging Grain Sources

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The National Grain Conference convened by the Executive Yuan was originally scheduled to open on the morning of the 12th. However, since the participants had not yet fully gathered, it was changed to 9:00 AM on the morning of the 13th, presided over by Premier Weng Wenhao.

### Gu Weijun Meets with Lovett: Urges the U.S. to Provide More Weapons to China; U.S. Military Supplies and Food to Be Directly Transported to North China Within Half a Month

Editorial

### After Restoring the Circulation of Coins

The recent panic over the shortage of materials, especially rice, firewood, and miscellaneous grains, is, as everyone knows, due to the arbitrary obstruction by various localities and the unwillingness of farmers to sell. Regarding the former, it can be easily eliminated as long as the central government issues a clear order and enforces the law strictly. Regarding the latter, it will not be effective unless efforts are made to restore confidence in the currency. Because currency originally has two functions: one is a measure of exchange, and the other is a store of value. During this period of inflation and drastic price fluctuations, these two functions have almost completely failed. No wonder the concept of "valuing goods over currency" has become more deeply rooted in people's minds.

The authorities shy away from admitting the failure of the issuance policy. In the past, they often shifted all responsibility to speculative merchants, believing that soaring prices and material shortages were entirely the result of their actions. It was not until farmers in various places retained their products and refused to sell, creating the current widespread food shortage, that they were willing to frankly admit their mistakes and take effective remedial measures on the currency issue itself.

Preparing to mint and issue coins and allowing the circulation of silver dollars are effective remedial measures determined by Finance Minister Xu after taking office. Regardless of whether restoring coins or even restoring silver dollars is a step backward in the currency system, at a time when the credit of paper money has obviously been shaken, this measure is undoubtedly a targeted remedy. Because this is a hard currency, which itself has a fairly high intrinsic value, and is different from the over-issued paper money. Although the legal tender has been in circulation for more than ten years, the general public has not completely lost faith in it. Before the Gold Yuan Notes were introduced, many places in the interior still used it as a medium of exchange, and even collected it sporadically as a means of preserving surplus purchasing power. Therefore, allowing silver dollars to circulate as one of the legal currencies is not only catering to people's preferences and changing their concept of "valuing goods over currency," but also indirectly increasing the value of the Gold Yuan Notes by determining a ratio between silver dollars and Gold Yuan Notes of one to ten, thereby stabilizing prices in the current extremely chaotic situation. As for the waste utilization of this part of coins and raw gold and silver, and the exemption of countless holders from legal penalties, those are all secondary matters.

The difficulties are: (1) According to the principle of good currency driving out bad currency, once these coins are put into public circulation, they may be snapped up for collection, and the desired effect may not be achieved. The recent rush to exchange one-cent copper coins, making them difficult to circulate, is a case in point. (2) When the legal tender was promoted in 1935, most of the silver coins in various places had already been recovered and shipped abroad. Moreover, another batch was re-collected and exchanged before the period from "August 19th" to the end of October. The amount of silver hidden among the people is probably very small. (3) Although it has now been decided to mint gold and silver coins ranging from one to one hundred yuan, the replenishment of raw materials for the new coins and the procedures for starting factories and minting coins are not very simple matters. Therefore, to restore confidence in the currency and make everyone happy to accept it, allowing materials to circulate as usual, the key still lies in the real control of the amount of issuance and the prompt permission to exchange for gold and silver.

It is said that the total amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency collected after "August 19th" reached about US$200 million. According to the newly revised exchange rate, the value of the Gold Yuan Notes has been devalued four times in disguise. In that case, it would not be difficult to recover all the Gold Yuan Notes that have already been issued by using only one-half of this amount. Therefore, before the Gold Yuan Notes are minted, if a method can be determined to quickly allow the exchange for gold or silver coins, without making a rigid requirement of redeeming at the same amount after one year of deposit, then the Gold Yuan Notes can be quickly withdrawn from circulation, and their value can be increased immediately. As a result, the exchange of materials and the level of wages can be easily readjusted in the short term. The exchange conditions attached this time, such as redeeming at the same amount after one year of deposit, may have a certain significance in absorbing currency and preventing the outflow of funds, but from the perspective of Gold Yuan Note holders, it is still somewhat unsatisfactory.

As for the total amount of Gold Yuan Notes to be issued, this time it is not rigidly stipulated, but changed to "determined by order separately." The only way to control it is that the supervisory committee for the issuance reserve can notify the Central Bank to stop issuing if it discovers that the reserve is insufficient. Therefore, we believe that the organization of this supervisory committee should be composed of representatives from the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, and national financial, industrial, and commercial organizations to supervise and demonstrate public trust. Fortunately, the organizational regulations of the committee are still to be drafted by the Executive Yuan. We sincerely hope that the authorities will adopt this suggestion to satisfy public expectations.

Since the establishment of the Weng cabinet, this is the third major economic reform. After experiencing great pain, the people generally have an urgent desire for stability. Because every reform inevitably causes disturbance and loss, and the widespread material shortage that has recently occurred in various places has caused the general public, whether rich or poor, to suffer equally in their lives, and they are all filled with anxiety. Now that the government has realized the failure of its past monetary policy, it has restored coins and taken out physical objects to restore confidence in the currency. It can naturally have a stabilizing effect on the current soaring prices, especially in today's tight money market, it is more likely to have the effect of suppressing prices. However, the government must have great determination in issuing coins and must achieve the prerequisite of no longer issuing Gold Yuan Notes. We believe that only under the condition of no longer issuing Gold Yuan Notes can the minting and issuing of gold and silver coins have the effect of contracting currency and suppressing prices. Conversely, if gold and silver coins are minted and issued while the currency continues to inflate, and Gold Yuan Notes and coins are circulating in the market at the same time, the phenomenon of "bad money driving out good money" will inevitably occur. The currency circulating in the market will still be Gold Yuan Notes, and it will naturally not have a stabilizing effect on prices.

### Good Response After the Revision of the Gold Yuan Note Measures; Prices Fall; Victory Reported from Xuzhou; People's Morale Boosted in Various Places

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] After the revised measures for the issuance of Gold Yuan Notes and the handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency held by the people were announced, the response in the capital's market on the 12th was extremely positive. Especially since the temporary martial law began on the 11th, rumors have subsided, order has been stabilized, and the empty shelves and store closures during the period of price limits and panic buying have completely become a thing of the past. On the morning of the 12th, 19 out of 10 stores opened for business, and inventories that had not been seen for many days emerged one after another, as did rice and food. Commodity prices generally fell across the board. The price of food rice fell relatively less due to rice source relations, while the decline in Wuyang Department Store was the most significant, reaching about 30%. Some stores even advertised with a 10% discount. The supply of vegetables and meat in the vegetable market exceeded demand, so many reduced prices to seek sales. In addition, since the 12th was the birthday of the National Father and banks were closed, the money market was extremely tight and cash was very scarce, which was also the main reason for the price drop. Silver coin transactions reappeared on the streets. Silver coins, which had reached more than 30 yuan on the black market two days ago, had fallen to around 20 yuan on the morning of the 12th, with many transactions being made at around 18 yuan, but there were few buyers. The black market for gold and foreign currency was also said to have fallen significantly.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 12th] The response in Hangzhou was good after the supplementary measures for currency reform were announced. Rice has fallen nearly 300 due to the abundance of sources, and vegetables have generally fallen by 20%. Meat prices are still as high as 16 yuan.

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 12th] Rice and grain rose and then fell, then turned firm again, as did soybean oil. Other items all fell. All the stores that had not opened will resume business today and tomorrow, and the appearance of the city has improved. Wuxi announced martial law, prohibiting passage from 11 pm every night.

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 12th] Victory was reported again from the Battle of Xuzhou, and people's morale was more stable. Commodity prices continued to decline, with rice at 280 yuan per picul and 20-count Hongkui cotton yarn at 6,800 yuan. Daily necessities also fell slightly.

[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 12th] Southern Anhui has been peaceful in recent days, and the Yangtze River defense has also been consolidated. Wuhu rice, which had risen to 450 yuan, has now fallen back to 300 yuan. Commander Ma Shigong ordered Wuhu to handle the ration of low-priced rice. The first batch of rice was purchased with a loan from the Central Bank, providing 3,000 piculs of rice.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 12th] After the revised measures for the issuance of Gold Yuan Notes were announced, commodity prices here have all trended downward, and goods that had been hidden have also emerged one after another. Rice, which had been rising sharply for several days, also fell by 50 yuan today. The news of the great victory in Xuzhou came in the evening, and people's morale was even more boosted.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 12th] The citizens of Xi'an responded very well to the government's announced measures for the issuance of coins. Prices of various goods generally fell by 20%, and yarn and cigarettes were no exception.

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 12th] After the revised measures for the handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency held by the people were announced, the prices of cloth and other items in Lanzhou fell by 20% to 30%, and grain prices were noticeably sluggish.

[Our Newspaper, Xiamen, 12th] After the announcement of the measures for the issuance of Gold Yuan Notes and the new exchange rate for foreign currency, all agencies and banks were closed today, and there was no significant reaction. The market was stable, but according to financial circles, the current Gold Yuan and U.S. dollar ratio has increased by 3 yuan based on the current market price, and commodity prices may be affected by this.

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 12th] On the 12th, prices in Chengdu rose due to the increase in the price of gold and silver. The money market was tight and transactions were deserted.

### Full Text of Fu Zuoyi's Speech Continued from Page One

I just said that China's current suppression of bandits and rebellion is a struggle between two different ways of life. We are defending national independence and dignity, striving for political democracy, economic equality, and freedom of life, realizing the lofty political ideal of the Three Principles of the People, and fighting for world peace, for freedom and democracy, and for the Chinese people's genuine peace and universal stability of life. Therefore, the meaning of suppressing bandits and rebellion today is not passive, but active; not conservative, but revolutionary. This is the essence of the war to suppress bandits and rebellion, and it is also the source of our strength. If we do not want to be slaves locked in an iron curtain, and choose the democratic, free, and peaceful way of life, we should add our strength to the camp of suppressing bandits and rebellion, because strength belongs to everyone, not to one person. We must strive for our own wishes, and only our own strength is the most reliable. The strength of the National Army in North China is strong, and with the united support of the people, it will surely achieve the people's wishes and complete the task of suppressing bandits and rebellion.

At present, we must universally and thoroughly carry out the work of a total war with close military, political, economic, and cultural coordination, focusing on the following points: (1) Thoroughly eradicate bandits and eliminate traitors, stabilize the internal situation, and consolidate the rear. Use the power of the people to eliminate the hidden elements of bandits and traitors who create rumors, stir up trouble, and conspire to sabotage. (2) Give full play to strong combat effectiveness, high morale, and pure skills to annihilate the enemy. (3) Economic interests should be consistent with the interests of the people, work should be linked to life, and rights should be linked to obligations, especially to protect the lives of the hard-working compatriots. (4) Anti-corruption and anti-degradation, to ensure political integrity and competence. (5) Break down private factional grievances. All personnel and all departments should actively cooperate with the work, and turn all forces into combat forces. (6) Unite the power of the people, and cooperate closely between the military, government, and people to strive for victory.

The seriousness of the current situation is so serious that we must catch up quickly and exert our greatest strength, so that we can create the greatest achievements. It is not so serious that we cannot do anything. The serious situation today is not a crisis, but an opportunity, a chance for survival. We must strengthen our confidence, make up our minds, use the power of unity, the unified will, and courageous action to enhance our strength and expand our strength. All wisdom should be used to suppress bandits, and all strength should be used on the front lines. Hard work will inevitably lead to success. Victory is not to be waited for. All thoughts of retreat are a dead end. The people of North China should unite and rise up together. The future is infinitely bright and full of hope.

Suppressing bandits and rebellion is to save the Chinese people from their current suffering and create genuine peace and lasting happiness. It is not for the sake of one person or one part of the people. As far as I, Fu Zuoyi, am concerned, I have no property to protect, and I am not fighting to maintain my official position, let alone for personal enjoyment. If you say that I am for enjoyment, I believe everyone knows what I have enjoyed. It can be said that there is only sacrifice, but I am very determined and hardworking. This determination and hard work is based on my belief in the doctrine, my understanding of the times, and my pursuit of ideals, and comes entirely from my sincerity to the country and the people. For the sake of the country and the people, I am willing to sacrifice myself. I also believe that our military and government cadres and all our comrades-in-arms share the same understanding as I do. It is not for a position or a few dollars, but to have ideals, understanding, ambitions, and aspirations, to be loyal to the revolution, and to serve the people. Everyone can come and see the lives of our military commanders at any time without prior notice. Although they are suffering, they never know what depression is, never become negative, and work very hard.

There is only one truth: the war to suppress bandits and rebellion to save the country, save the people, and save ourselves will surely be victorious. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we believed that the 20th century was an era of national rejuvenation. No matter how strong Japan was, the War of Resistance would eventually succeed. Today, we are also convinced that democracy and freedom will surely defeat totalitarian terror. Although hardship is inevitable, as long as we are determined and prepared to face difficulties, the people of North China are rich in the spirit of perseverance and courage. Everyone should unite, and I, Zuoyi, am willing to follow the people of North China, under the leadership of President Chiang, and under the will of the people, to work hard and struggle to realize our aspirations. (The End)

### The Political Committee Debates Disarmament Issues; The United States Refutes Soviet Accusations; Announces that Soviet Military Strength is Five Times Greater Than That of the West

[United Press, Paris, 12th] U.S. Representative Osborn stated in the Political Committee of the United Nations today that Soviet military strength is enormous. Reportedly, the Soviet Union has 4 million troops, and the countries under Soviet control have another 2.8 million troops. The total of the two is 250 divisions of common combat forces, which is equal to five times the total amount of troops of Western countries. Since the end of World War II, the Soviet Union has not helped to promote international trust. For example, the Berlin issue directly rejected the mediation plan of six neutral countries. Osborn finally expressed support for the proposal made by Belgium.

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] U.S. Representative Osborn also accused the Soviet Union of attempting to create a world revolution. He said that the Soviet Union is fully armed and is attempting to overthrow the remaining representative governments throughout the world. The Soviet Union is capable of launching an aggressive war to continue attacking other countries. The Soviet Union is using most of its manpower and resources for war preparations, which is different from Western countries. The Soviet Union is the only country that launches propaganda institutions under government control to urge people to prepare for war. Osborn's speech came as the Political Committee of the United Nations debated the Soviet proposal for the five powers to disarm by one-third within a year. His remarks were also a response to Soviet Representative Vyshinsky's lengthy speech on the 11th, condemning the United States for planning an aggressive war.

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] The Political Committee will consider two proposals in the current disarmament debate: one is the Soviet proposal to reduce armaments and ban atomic bombs, and the other is the Belgian proposal supported by Western countries, which advocates that the Regular Armaments Committee put forward a plan to reorganize international control.

### The United States Will Re-evaluate Its Policy Toward the Soviet Union; Secretary Marshall Meets With Forrestal and Smith Separately in Paris; The United States and Canada Will Hold Talks on a Security Alliance Next Week

[Central News Agency, Paris, 11th, Associated Press] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal began consultations here today. Well-informed sources said that this move may be a precursor to the United States re-evaluating its policy toward the Soviet Union. The sources said that reviewing U.S.-Soviet relations is one of the main tasks after Truman's election. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith is expected to arrive here from Moscow on Friday or Saturday to participate in this review. However, Forrestal will likely leave before Smith's arrival, and Marshall will synthesize the opinions of the two.

It is generally believed that Forrestal's mission is to bring the latest views on the Cold War plan in Washington to Secretary Marshall, while Smith will report on Moscow's reaction after Truman's election to Marshall. Marshall, Forrestal, and other U.S. officials here also discussed the proposed North Atlantic defense agreement.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] After arriving here, U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal held three consecutive talks with Secretary of State Marshall. Forrestal also had lengthy conversations with Harriman, the European director of the Marshall Plan, Caffery, the U.S. Ambassador to France, and Ramadier, the French Minister of Defense. U.S. officials here said that Forrestal's talks were a comprehensive survey of military and diplomatic issues around the world. They did not express whether the Atlantic alliance was one of the topics discussed.

[Agence France-Presse, Canada, 11th] According to authoritative sources, the United States and Canada will hold talks next week to decide on coordinating military industries and exchanging military equipment within the scope of the future collective security alliance.

### The Soviet Peace Offensive; The West Will Not Be Fooled

[United Press, Paris, 12th] A major representative to the United Nations General Assembly said today that the rumors about a meeting between Truman and Stalin are a Soviet propaganda peace offensive. The Soviet Union is clearly uneasy about the unified front of major powers in the United Nations General Assembly, so it wants to use this offensive to weaken the position of Western countries.

### French President's Speech Reaffirms Policy Toward Germany

Insists on International Co-Management of the Ruhr

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] On the anniversary of the armistice of World War I, French President Auriol delivered a speech stating, "We must win peace. We must not forget the mistakes after World War I that led to the second disaster. We must never repeat them. All of Europe has been deeply ravaged by Germany in spirit and material. It would be unfair if Germany escapes the obligation to compensate and there is no definite guarantee of control over Germany's re-aggression." President Auriol emphasized that Germany's heavy industrial zone must be under international control. He said, "We insist that we will never allow any economic measures that disregard experience, principle, and prudence to exist. Germany should contribute to the reconstruction of Europe, but we cannot allow the armaments factories in the Ruhr to return to the hands of Hitler's followers or Germans who will threaten world peace in the future. The Ruhr should be internationally owned and co-managed internationally. This is the only way to guarantee the security of Europe and the German people themselves."

### Millions of German Workers Launch a One-Day General Strike

[Associated Press, Frankfurt, 12th] Millions of German workers launched the largest 24-hour general strike in postwar Germany on the 12th, following orders from the trade union, to protest the high cost of living. Boerner, the head of the trade union in the British occupation zone, estimated that 8 million people had gone on strike, including 3 million non-union members, who could not go to work due to traffic disruptions. The initial order was quite good.

### The American People's Aversion to War Led to the Rejection of Dewey

A Soviet Literary Newspaper Comments on the U.S. Election

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 11th, Associated Press] The Literary Gazette stated that the American people represent peace and democracy, and oppose war-mongers and the tyranny of capitalism. The newspaper explained the results of the U.S. election and said that the facts show us that the results are not because the people are more fond of Truman, but because the people are electing the "lesser of two evils." "Truman is better than Dewey, a disguised reactionary, because Dewey has obvious fascist ideas and is one of the unforgivable warmongers."

### Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of the Armistice; A Chorus of Prayers for Peace; French Veterans Demonstrate and Clash With the Military Police

[United Press, New York, 11th] The 11th is the anniversary of the armistice of World War I. The world celebrated amid turmoil, praying for a lasting peace that two world wars had failed to achieve. The United States, Britain, France, and other countries paid tribute to their fallen soldiers with solemn ceremonies. The sound of prayers for peace could be heard everywhere in the United States, but there were also speeches implying the need to be prepared for the worst. The traditional center of Armistice Day in the United States is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery near Washington. President Truman's military aide placed a wreath on the white marble tomb at 11:00 a.m. today, the time when World War I ended thirty years ago. Dozens of other wreaths and various flowers were placed on the tombs of the fallen soldiers in World War II.

[Agence France-Presse, Chaillot Palace, 11th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie delivered a speech here today commemorating the 30th anniversary of the armistice of World War I, praising the brave men and women who sacrificed themselves for world peace in that war. Lie said, "We hope that those who still remain today will continue to strive for peace." Emphasizing the difficulties faced by the United Nations, Lie said that the United Nations organization can save the world from another catastrophe. He also said, "A strong, effective, and sufficient United Nations to maintain peace and welfare is the best monument that mankind can build."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] France and North Africa solemnly held ceremonies today to commemorate the armistice of World War I. All churches held special services. Unfortunately, an incident occurred during the memorial parade in this city this afternoon.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] Fierce fighting broke out here this afternoon during the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the armistice of World War I. It is said that one of the participants in the parade was injured by a police bullet, and several others were also injured at the same time. Dozens of people were arrested, which greatly dampened the celebration. The conflict arose because two to three thousand left-wing veterans disregarded the police's obstruction and instructions and marched towards the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. After being stopped by the police, it became a melee. The crowd attacked the police and police cars with stones, and the chaos gradually subsided by evening.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] After the clash between demonstrators and military police at the Place de la République today during the celebration of the anniversary of the armistice of World War I, representatives of the "Free Combatants" League and the Federation of Journalists affiliated to the General Confederation of Labor appealed to President Auriol, protesting against the measures taken by Interior Minister Moch. Representatives of the "Free Combatants" strongly argued that the police attempted to cut the parade into two sections, which led to the conflict. Representatives of the Federation of Journalists said that one journalist and one photographer covering the event were beaten and injured by the police. The representatives demanded that the Ministry of the Interior guarantee that such incidents would not happen again. The conflict area is currently calm.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 11th] Two veteran soldiers from Siam who participated in World War I will march today wearing their medals to commemorate Armistice Day. A banquet will be held in the gardens of the Grand Palace tonight. Veteran soldiers from China, Britain, France, and other Allied countries have been invited to attend. It is estimated that there were 1,400 Siamese soldiers who participated in World War I, some of whom served in French mechanical units. It is believed that only about 400 of them are still alive, and most of the rest died in France because they were born in the tropical climate of Siam and died from the cold.

### Chiang Ting-fu's Heated Debate with Vyshinsky: Accuses the Soviet Union of Interfering in China's Civil War and Driving Japanese POWs to Aid the Communists in Rebellion

[United Press International, Paris, November 11] Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu today criticized the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal in the UN Political Committee, asserting that it indirectly interfered in China's internal affairs. He further stated that Soviet policy was a factor in creating one of Asia's greatest anxieties and that the Soviet proposal to reduce the military strength of the five major powers by one-third would, in effect, weaken China's efforts to suppress the rebellion.

[Associated Press, Paris, November 11] In discussions about disarmament, a problem that all diplomats unanimously considered destined to fail, Chiang Ting-fu clashed sharply with Soviet representative Vyshinsky. Chiang bluntly opposed the recent Soviet proposal to reduce the armaments of the five major powers by one-third. In declaring that China could not reduce its strength in the war against the Communists, he pointed out that the primary step the United Nations should take to achieve world peace should be "to disarm the fifth columns within China, Greece, and Korea, and the fifth columns throughout the world." Chiang Ting-fu accused the Soviet Union of using the 80,000 Japanese prisoners of war it obtained in World War II to assist the Chinese Communists, with 50,000 of them fighting in Manchuria and 30,000 serving as technical experts for the Communist Party. This was the most direct condemnation in a public debate of Soviet aid to the Chinese Communists.

In response, Vyshinsky declared that he doubted whether China's disarmament "would have any effect on the outcome of the great war between the 'people' of China and the Chinese army, a war which now shows the brilliant victory of the 'people.'" He accused China of being deeply afraid of disarmament because China needs "every tank, every shell, every soldier, and every firearm to cope with and deal with the 'people' of China." Chiang Ting-fu declared, "The distance between the words of the Soviet delegation here and the conduct of the Soviet government is as far as the north is from the south." Chiang further explained, "China is currently engaged in a serious civil war, just like the United States eighty-eight years ago and the Soviet Union in 1917. If anyone had proposed disarmament to Lincoln, Lincoln would certainly have considered it an unfriendly act. If the League of Nations had advised Lenin to disarm thirty years ago, Lenin would have laughed and denounced the proposal as malicious."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, November 11] Chiang Ting-fu's attack on the Soviet Union's use of Japanese prisoners of war provoked a fierce attack from Soviet representative Vyshinsky. Vyshinsky told the chairman of the committee, Mr. Spaak, that it was incomprehensible that the chairman would tolerate this "shameless attack on the Soviet Union." Vyshinsky emphasized that the chairman was unable to make the representatives express politeness, and said, "I can only come to one conclusion, that the Soviet representative must defend his own dignity and can no longer rely on the chairman to do the work." Spaak only asked the representatives to stop other incidents so that the matter could be brought to a close.

### U.S. Representative to the Far Eastern Commission Rejects Soviet Demands on Japan

Japan has Already been Disarmed; The Soviet Union can Rest Assured

[United Press International, Washington, November 11] At today's regular meeting of the Far Eastern Commission, U.S. representative McCoy rejected Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin's request to intensify participation in the control of Japan with a stern tone. McCoy's main points were three: (1) Japan has already been thoroughly disarmed. The United States believes that Japan will not launch an aggression again, and the Soviet Union can rest assured. (2) The United States has repeatedly proposed the early restoration of Japan's peacetime economy, just as the Soviet Union hopes.

### Greek Cabinet Resigns Due to Internal Divisions within the Liberal Party; Tsaldaris is the Most Popular Candidate to Succeed as Prime Minister

[Associated Press, Athens, November 12] Greek Prime Minister Sophoulis finally fulfilled his long-held promise on the 12th, submitting the resignation of the entire cabinet. King Paul is expected to immediately begin searching for a new prime minister, with Foreign Minister Tsaldaris being the most popular candidate to succeed him, as Tsaldaris is the leader of the People's Party, the largest party in parliament. Sophoulis' resignation was caused by internal divisions within the Liberal Party, with Deputy Party Leader Venizelos automatically announcing on the 11th that he no longer had confidence in the government, which accelerated Sophoulis' departure. However, he had also repeatedly threatened to resign recently, and last expressed his intention to resign last weekend, but agreed to continue in office until the United Nations debate on the Greek issue concluded.

### Siamese Cabinet Reshuffle; Several Ministers to be Replaced

Due to the Parliament and People's Criticism of the Government's Incompetence

[United Press International, Bangkok, November 11] Siamese Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkhram announced today that the cabinet will be partially reshuffled, replacing several new ministers. The individual resignations of various ministers were triggered by criticism of the government's incompetence by parliament and the public. It is expected that the ministers of finance, commerce, interior, and transportation will all be replaced.

(3) The Soviet proposal that various countries involved control Japanese industry for several years would inevitably continue until after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, which is beyond the authority of the Far Eastern Commission. After the establishment of the peace treaty, Japan should be subject to the control of the peace treaty, and the Far Eastern Commission no longer has the right to jurisdiction. McCoy finally stated that the Soviet proposal does not provide practical solutions. This committee already has a far-reaching policy for disarming Japan, which is being implemented by MacArthur. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has direct speaking rights in the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Control Council in Tokyo, so there is no need to change the direction. As for the so-called U.S. military rebuilding the Yokosuka naval port, that is not the case.

### Syngman Rhee Announces Partial Reshuffle of the Korean Cabinet

[United Press International, Seoul, November 12] Korean President Syngman Rhee told the press today that after the United Nations General Assembly discusses the Korean issue, the Korean cabinet may undergo a partial reshuffle. The parliament recently requested the president to strengthen the cabinet lineup.

### The President Cares About Shanghai's Food Supply; Mayor Wu Proposes Two Suggestions; Returns to Shanghai the Same Evening and Expresses Optimism about the Future of Prices

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, November 12] Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen was summoned to Beijing to attend the food conference. He arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th. Because the food conference had been postponed to the 13th, Wu paid his respects to the President and President Weng in Beijing on the 12th, and returned to Shanghai on the night train on the 12th. Wu paid his respects to the President at 10:30 on the morning of the 12th, reporting on the situation in Shanghai. The President inquired in detail about the current price and food problems in Shanghai. Wu also put forward two suggestions regarding food: (1) Provinces should not prevent the transport of food out of the province. (2) Food should not be taxed. The President agreed with both suggestions. He then paid his respects to President Weng, making the same report and suggestions. According to Wu's remarks on the evening of the 12th, there is a comprehensive solution to the food problem in Shanghai. After the Hong Kong rice arrives in Shanghai, the insufficient amount of food rationing in October can be made up. In the future, American aid food will be shipped in steadily, and there is no need to worry about the food supply in Shanghai. In the past few days, the food supply in Shanghai has become normal, and food prices have been falling day by day. At this time, the government announced the revised method of issuing gold yuan notes, and people can hold gold, silver and foreign currencies. It is believed that both prices and food prices can be stable for a longer period of time in the future.

### Grand Gathering at the Cultural Hall Commemorates the National Day; More Than a Thousand Representatives from Various Agencies and Students Attended

Yesterday, amid widespread price declines, all walks of life in the city commemorated the birthday of the founding father of the nation. All agencies, schools, and businesses followed the usual practice of taking a day off, and the markets were closed. Under the bright sunshine, national flags flew throughout the city. All public parks were open to the public free of charge. The citizens shook off the tension of the past few days and spent this holiday in a relaxed and cheerful mood. The Shanghai Municipality Celebration of the Founding Father's Birthday Commemoration Conference was held at 9:30 yesterday morning at the Cultural Hall on Zhapu Road. More than a thousand representatives from various agencies, citizens, and students attended.

Stabilize the Economy, Ensure Public Safety

The meeting was opened by Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang, who stated: "If there were no Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, there would be no Three Principles of the People, nor would there be the Republic of China. When we commemorate the birthday of the founding father of the nation today, we should always review how to commemorate the founding father of the nation and how to be a loyal follower of the founding father of the nation. China is now a democratic country. The Constitution stipulates that the Republic of China is a Republic based on the Three Principles of the People. All Chinese people should be loyal followers of the founding father of the nation. At a time when the country is in difficulty, we must remember that the founding father of the nation overcame all kinds of hardships to create the Republic of China, and we must constantly review the current difficult environment, cooperate with the evolution of military affairs and economy, and strengthen our efforts and vigilance." Fang then solemnly and firmly put forward three points: "(1) The Communist bandits are supported by red imperialism, seizing cities and territories, and endangering the people. We must understand that protecting the country and protecting our families is the responsibility of everyone, immediately arm ourselves, and strengthen our determination. (2) The Communist bandits are launching a rumor offensive in an attempt to disrupt the public's minds. They recently claimed that the city would cut off electricity and water. Facts have proven that this is absolutely not the case. We must always be vigilant and combat this conspiracy, and cooperate with the front-line military operations. If we discover underground Communist bandits who spread rumors and confuse the public, we should report them to the relevant authorities and severely punish them in accordance with martial law. (3) Maintaining economic stability and ensuring local security is the government's greatest determination. The phenomenon of economic turmoil during the past period of price limits is hoped not to be repeated. In the future, merchants must show conscience, only seek not to lose money, and must not seek excessive profits, hoarding and raising prices, which is tantamount to being a puppet for the bandits. The authorities will impose severe punishments."

Training Work, Rapid Development Followed by a speech by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, who, after exposing various Communist bandit conspiracies, stated: After the establishment of the Shanghai Self-Defense Force Headquarters, the training work in various districts will be rapidly launched from the 15th of this month, so that the citizens of the city can jointly participate in the sacred work of defending Shanghai. He also suggested that Chairman Fang should follow the late president's exhortation of "Consult with the multitude of talents and be the vanguard of the people" and take the lead in joining the self-defense force, arming all, and being a role model for the citizens. After the speech, everyone shouted slogans under the leadership of Chairman Fang, and movies were shown, and the meeting adjourned at noon.

Celebration Conference of Party Departments at All Levels

The Shanghai Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang and its affiliated party departments at all levels held a celebration conference in memory of the anniversary of the birth of the premier at the auditorium of Gezhi Middle School in the city at 2:00 pm yesterday. More than 800 members of the Municipal Party Department and cadres at all levels attended the meeting, which was chaired and addressed by Director Fang. Then Secretary Xie Renzhao and others delivered speeches successively, and the meeting adjourned at about 4 o'clock.

### Frequent Welcoming and Sending Off for the Comfort of Troops Transiting

The Municipal Committee for Welcoming and Comforting Troops Transiting for the Suppression of Rebellion has been working extremely hard in recent days. In addition to posting large banners and distributing printed pamphlets at transportation docks and stations, when the transiting troops arrive in the city, representatives from all walks of life lead art performance teams to the docks to set off firecrackers to welcome them warmly. When the various units leave Shanghai, they are presented with comfort food. Chairman Fang, Xu Wuya, Zhao Yangxiong, and Tan Yimin went to deliver speeches separately. The officers and soldiers were all inspired by what they heard. In particular, the officers and soldiers of the various units were very interested in the slogans written by the committee, and they took the initiative to ask for them to keep as souvenirs, which shows the excitement of the officers and soldiers.

### The Industry Federation Met to Discuss Land and Had No Proper Solution

The representatives of the National Federation of Industries residing in Shanghai continued to hold a meeting at the 5th floor of the Enterprise Building at 3 pm yesterday. More than 100 representatives from Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, Qing, Gan, Min, Shu, Jin, Su, Han and other places attended the meeting, including Pan Yangshan, Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongzhu, Li Zhuchen, Wang Taizhen, Zhang Jian, Peng Shihong, Yu Putian, and Liu Dongye. Li Zhuchen served as the temporary chairman. Among the representatives from Nanjing, Chen Yunzhang was also recommended to come to Shanghai to convey opinions, hoping that the representatives residing in Shanghai would go to Nanjing to hold a meeting. After discussion, the representatives residing in Shanghai believed that there was no preconceived opinion on whether the meeting should be held in Beijing or Shanghai, but because there were more representatives residing in Shanghai, transportation would indeed be a problem if everyone went to Beijing. After a long discussion, there was still no proper solution. It was decided to hold a discussion meeting again at the original location at 10 am today to continue the discussion.

### The Tofu Industry Lacks Soybeans; The Workers' Union Asks for the Source

[This newspaper's report] Most tofu shops in the city have suspended operations and closed due to the lack of soybeans, causing panic among workers who have lost their jobs. The workers' union in the industry has submitted a request to the authorities to unblock the source of soybeans so that the capitalists can restore normal operations and stabilize the lives of the workers.

### Cigarette Prices Plummet; Rice Stalls are Everywhere, but No One Asks About Them

Since the promulgation of the revised method for issuing gold yuan notes and the method for handling gold, silver and foreign currencies owned by the people, the general situation in the city has been good. Yesterday, the prices of various commodities did not continue to rise, especially the price of cigarettes, which plummeted. The retail price of cigarettes, such as Three Cannon Towers, once sold for 18 yuan per pack, but yesterday it was 7 yuan per pack. White tin packs fell from 17 yuan per pack to 8 yuan per pack, and 20-piece Qianmen packs fell from 10 yuan per pack to 5.5 yuan per pack. As for the situation of food rice, it is even more stable. Yesterday, all rice stores in the city sold snow-white rice, with a price of 800 yuan per Dan, but very few people asked about it. The reason is that a huge amount of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai in a few days. A batch of rice from Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, has also been airlifted to Shanghai, and because it is not easy to buy rice in the urban area, the families in the city have been rushing to buy it in the nearby rural areas. Therefore, the rising trend of rice prices has been thwarted. Yesterday, temporary rice stalls were densely distributed along Baoshan Road and North Henan Road in the North Station area of the city, and they were selling rice by the Dou and Sheng, with a price of 70 yuan per Dou, but still few people asked about it.

### Compiling the Index is a Major Key; Rice, Coal, etc. Face Calculating Prices; Must Wait for the Municipal Council to Decide

Regarding the compilation of the cost of living index for the first half of this month, a person in charge of the Municipal Statistics Office told a Dagongshe reporter yesterday: "Our office has never interrupted the investigation of commodity prices. After the cost of living index is restored for salary calculation, we will follow the past method of investigating commodity prices, investigating once every Tuesday and Friday. Yesterday (12th) was the last time for the commodity price investigation of the cost of living index for the first half of this month. The items of daily necessities calculated are still 45 kinds for workers and 93 kinds for staff. However, after the price limit is lifted this time, there is still a major key in the compilation of the first cost of living index, which needs to be decided by the municipal council to be held today, that is, whether several important daily necessities such as rice and coal are calculated according to the ration price. It is also learned that after the compilation of the cost of living index this time, the cost of living index compilation review committee organized by the original representatives of various agencies and groups will be responsible for reviewing and announcing it."

### The Wage Borrowing Movement in the Knitting Industry Was Resolved Yesterday

More than 500 hand-operated knitting machine groups and thousands of workers in the knitting industry requested a wage borrowing movement due to the hardship of their lives. The workers in each factory negotiated directly with the capitalists, resulting in the suspension of work and sitting down to borrow wages in factories such as Xiongdi Er You Zhenghua Rui Da. After learning about this, the Social Affairs Bureau sent staff to mediate overnight and advised the workers to resume work first and return to their homes, and wait for the wage borrowing problem to be handled in accordance with legal procedures. At 10 am yesterday, the Labour-Capital Knitting Industry Workers' Union and the Capital-Knitting Industry Guild were convened to make every effort to mediate, and a satisfactory solution was reached: (1) The wages for October 37 will be issued by each factory in accordance with the method agreed upon by both parties, and one month's wage equivalent to the actual wage earned by each worker in October will be issued. (2) For November 37, each factory will be allowed to borrow wages in advance and give them to the workers. Both parties agreed that the socks produced by each factory will be issued at the factory's price. (3) Small-scale factories that are unable to bear the advance borrowing in November may negotiate on their own between labour and capital. (4) The amount of the advance borrowing stipulated in the second item will be deducted by each factory in instalments starting from November. (5) After the workers of each factory receive the advance borrowing in November, they shall not leave the factory without permission before they are paid off, and the capitalists of each factory shall copy the national identity cards of each worker for reference.

The defendant also flatly denied that he had illegally made 80 foreign exchange transactions within the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The case was adjourned to the 23rd of this month for further trial.

### The Military Friends Society Holds a Military Social Gathering

For the sake of promoting the proper entertainment of officers and men in the war of suppression and construction, the Military Friends Society holds a military social gathering every half month. The first social gathering was held at 10 am yesterday, and the Shanghai Municipal Sea, Land and Air Force Political Workers Joint Conference was held at the same time. More than 300 people, including Zhang Fengzhou, Wang Zhesheng, Long Guanjun, Luo Zhemin, Li Yuelin, and Li Wenlie, attended the meeting with enthusiasm. First, Zhang gave a report on the significance of the social gathering, followed by speeches by the Acting Chairman of the Society, Director-General Luo, and Group Leader Long.

### Garrison Command Cracks Down on Major Organization Aiding Communists; Nine Key Suspects Arrested for Illicitly Purchasing Large Quantities of Western Medicine

The Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command recently cracked down on a large-scale organization established in Shanghai by the Jianghai Company of the Third District of the Subei Military Region of the Communist bandits. This organization was dedicated to illicitly purchasing supplies to aid the bandits. Nine key suspects were apprehended. The details of the crackdown are as follows: At the beginning of this month, the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command received a confidential report stating that the Jianghai Company of the Third District of the Subei Military Region of the Communist bandits had recently transported pigs to Shanghai to illicitly purchase large quantities of supplies, intending to smuggle them to the bandit areas to support the bandits. The Garrison Command dispatched personnel to investigate and confirmed the report. They learned that a bandit ship, Xiaoyuansha (No. 7753), had loaded pigs from the bandit area on the 3rd and arrived in Shanghai. It was preparing to illicitly purchase large quantities of Western medicine and was planning to depart on the 4th, taking advantage of the tide to sail out of the Yangjing estuary and transport the goods back to the bandit area. After receiving the report, Commander Xuan immediately ordered action to be taken. At 3:00 PM on the 4th, he dispatched a large number of officers to Yangjing to prepare. Around 5:00 PM, the bandit ship did indeed set sail with the tide. Personnel from the Garrison Command intercepted and seized the ship as it sailed to the Yangjing estuary. A search revealed a large quantity of Western medicines such as Soothachin and Suddia anti-inflammatory tablets hidden in the ship's lower hold. The captain, Su Zhenglin, and another Western medicine merchant aiding the bandits, Lu Fulin, were immediately arrested and taken to the Garrison Command for interrogation. After rigorous questioning, it was learned that the purchasers in Shanghai for the Jianghai Company of the Third District of the Subei Military Region of the Communist bandits were Liu Jinfu and Ding Zhenghong. Ding lived at No. 317 Gongxing Road, Zhabei, in this city, and the organization for illicitly purchasing supplies to aid the bandits was also located there. However, Ding had falsely established the Zhenchang Knitting Factory as a cover, and Liu Jinfu was posing as a technician at the factory. The Garrison Command immediately dispatched personnel to search and arrest the suspects. Ding Zhenghong had already fled, but Liu Jinfu was arrested on the spot. A large quantity of supplies and evidence were seized. After rigorous interrogation, the following key suspects were arrested: Wang Ruiqing, Sun Yongkang, Wu Wenzhi, Zhang Mengsheng, Chen Yafei, Yang Yu, and Mao Yuqing. They confessed that, in addition to illicitly purchasing Western medicine, they had also smuggled large quantities of military firearms and explosives to the bandit area. Considering the seriousness of the case and the wide range of involvement, the Garrison Command is currently interrogating the suspects overnight and pursuing the remaining criminals. More significant developments may occur in the coming days.

### The Full Picture of the Huainan Coal Mine

— Our Reporter Dou Baiping

[Report from our newspaper, Jiulonggang, 7th] Amidst the heavy war situation and the destruction of many industrial and mining enterprises in the country, we especially cherish the prosperity and growth of the Huainan Coal Mine on the south bank of the Huaihe River in northern Anhui, which is only 160 kilometers in a straight line from Nanjing. Speaking of the Huainan Mine, from its historical process, production status, and future prospects, facing the current reality of widespread coal shortage, the reporter first appeals to the government to provide special support and assistance to this Huainan Mine, which is closest to the capital, so that it can fully exert its capabilities on the road to national construction. The Huainan Mine currently has three iron fields: Jiulonggang, Datong, and Bagongshan. The entire mining area occupies a surface area of 470,000 mu.

Coal Mining Situation: Currently, the Jiuneng and Datong fields have a total of twelve vertical shafts and two inclined shafts, which are used to supply coal, hoist materials, transport personnel up and down, and for ventilation. The underground development project involves opening up main roadways in the rock layer or coal seam with a solid top and bottom. A rock door is opened every 100 to 150 meters, penetrating each coal seam. Then, coal roadways are opened along the coal seam. From the coal roadway, a coal eye is opened upwards every 30 to 40 meters, and a 45-degree upward-sloping tunnel is opened for easy material transportation. Then, a counter ditch is opened every 15 meters in height. The coal limits between the counter ditches are staggered by three or four meters to the left and right, for a total of five counter ditches, reaching the upper old tunnel. To date, the deepest underground development project in each mining field is 330 meters.

After the coal limits and counter ditches are opened, the miners divide the coal into several squares and use the collapse method, starting the retreat mining from the upper counter ditch. This is locally known as "luoduo," which means first excavating the lower part of the innermost square, causing the upper part to fall on its own, and then gradually retreating from the inside to the outside. It is said that the miners are very skilled in this method, but the recovery rate is only about 60%. When mining coal seams with solid tops and bottoms, it is planned to use the complete warehouse pillar method. This method was used in the eastern part of Datong Mine at the 240-meter level, south of the sixth rock door, in August last year, and the results were good. However, due to the miners' lack of technical proficiency, it is still being improved.

The coal is transported within the counter ditch entirely by manual labor. It is dropped from the coal eye to the coal roadway, loaded into coal cars, which run on steel rails, and pushed manually through the rock door to the main roadway. Then, it is hoisted to the surface by a winch cage. At the 330-meter level of the Jiulong South Mine field, diesel locomotives are now being used to transport coal, and they are being installed. At the 330-meter level of the Datong Mine field, endless rope trolleys are used to transport coal, and there are four sets of endless belt conveyors, which send the coal directly from the wellhead to the screening machine, and then to the coal bin after screening.

A Glimpse of the Equipment

Through the accumulation of bit by bit of blood and sweat, the current coal mining equipment includes 29 various types of boilers, 24 various types of electric and steam winches, 7 air compressors, 30 electric pumps, 1,202 coal cars, air pots, air hammers, and machine factory equipment, all of which are available.

Electricity is supplied by the Huainan Power Plant in Tianjia'an. The plant has a generating capacity of 9,200 KW, which is transmitted to each mine at 22,000 volts high voltage. The substations in each mine transform it into 3,300 volts or 380-220 volts, which are used to power the large and small machines.

Coking was done using indigenous methods in Jiulong South in 1946. In 1947, the Datong coking field was expanded. Through efforts and improvements, a total of 1,278 tons of coke was produced by the end of August this year. It is said that it is popular in Nanjing.

Achievements in Three Years

From the victory in 1945 to this year, just enough time has passed. Huainan Mine has enriched its equipment and increased its coal production in three years, and its current scale has been established. The development of a production enterprise lies in increasing production. After the takeover of the Huainan Mine, new wells were built after rectification, adding three new wells and a new air shaft, which is worth special mention.

Datong No. 3 well was planned to be excavated during the Japanese occupation. Construction continued after the restoration. By the end of last year, it had been mined to 346 meters, with an inner diameter of 6 meters, a stone-built well ring, and a reinforced concrete well building. It is equipped with automatic car-changing crawlers. The well frame is 40 meters high and is made entirely of steel. It has a 1,000-horsepower steam winch, and the cage is nailed with double rails, which can hold four 0.85-ton coal cars. The underground main roadway is opened in the rock layer. All engineering equipment has been completed and began to be used in October this year, with a daily output of 3,000 tons of coal. This well has the newest equipment in the Huainan Mine. Unfortunately, when the reporter arrived, it was shut down for repairs, and the original plan to go down the well to visit was called off. No. 7 well started construction in January last year and had reached 330 meters in October this year. Mining Director Zhang Guangzheng said: It is estimated that the total depth is 420 meters and will be completed in June next year. The inner diameter is 5 meters, and it is also a stone-built well ring, with a 40 cm concrete injection after the stone rotation, and an electric winch of 600 horsepower. The original depth of No. 3 well in Jiulonggang mining field was 177.5 meters. The deepening work started in July 1946 and was completed at the end of last year, deepening to 330 meters. The winch room has been completed, and automatic tanks are being designed and manufactured. It is estimated that the daily output of coal will be 2,500 tons.

An air shaft is being opened between the Datong and Jiulonggang mines. It is planned to be 330 meters deep. Construction started in May last year and has now reached 180 meters, with an inner diameter of 5 meters. It has two outlets for air, equipped with two centrifugal fans, 375 horsepower, rotating 600 times per minute, with an air volume of 41,600 cubic meters per minute and an air pressure of 250 cm.

New plans

The Huainan Mine currently has three mining fields, with a total coal reserve of 550 million tons. Based on the current daily output of 4,000 tons, it can be mined for 382 years. The Mining Bureau is working day and night to increase production, but as a public enterprise, it is limited by financial resources. Coal cannot automatically come out of the well. In this turbulent year, it is very difficult to obtain loans. The focus is now on the US$3.5 million aid loan in March next year. The initial draft of the new plan has been completed. Director Wang said that if it proceeds according to the plan, the daily output can reach 15,000 tons in two years, which is exactly the same as deepening the current output. If this continues, it can be mined for 100 years.

### Completion of the Gazetteer of Jiangxi Province

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 10th] The Gazetteer of Jiangxi Province has now been compiled and completed in its first draft by the Jiangxi Literature Committee. However, due to the committee's financial difficulties, it lacks the funds for printing. The chief editor, Wu Zongci, has written to the Provincial Assembly, requesting them to find a way to raise funds to print 500 copies, with the principle of distributing an average of five copies to each county. The entire book is divided into: (1) eight chapters belonging to historical reference materials; (2) nine chapters belonging to arts and literature; (3) thirty volumes belonging to literary collections; (4) biographies of historical figures; (5) five chapters belonging to geography; (6) four chapters belonging to clans; (7) one chapter belonging to ethnic groups; (8) two chapters belonging to chronicles of major events; (9) one chapter belonging to literary inquisitions in Jiangxi; (10) two chapters belonging to religion; (11) three chapters belonging to dialects and folk rhymes; (12) two chapters belonging to foreign affairs; and (13) three chapters belonging to maps. The chief editor, Wu Zongci, is a veteran journalist who is now in his seventies.

[Another Dispatch] The veteran journalist Wu Zongci has recently completed his "Chronicle of the Xinhai Revolution and the Restoration of Jiangxi." The content is divided into: the revolutionary movement before the Xinhai Uprising, the restoration of Jiujiang, the restoration of Nanchang, a special record of the deeds of sending troops to aid other provinces after the uprising, other important events, the Battle of Hukou, and the Chronicle of the Campaign Against Yuan Shikai. This manuscript is the only record of the history of Jiangxi's sacrifices for the revolution. Unfortunately, due to the Literature Committee's financial difficulties, it cannot be printed for the time being.

### Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, USA Actively Researches the Atomic Nucleus, Which Will Bring New Contributions to Medicine, Agriculture, and Industry

Research on the atomic nucleus is progressing rapidly at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, USA (65 miles from New York), which has become the center of atomic nucleus research. Talented scientists from all over the northeastern United States are concentrating their efforts at the National Brookhaven Laboratory to increase human knowledge of atomic nuclear forces and their beneficial uses, and to train many young scientists to continue this work.

Increasing Applied Knowledge

The main purpose of this work is the basic research on atomic energy and the nature of matter itself, that is, to devote itself to the study of the uses of atoms in culture and construction. It is expected that this work will increase the applied knowledge in medicine, agriculture, and industry.

In medicine, radioactive iodine is now available for the treatment of various tumors, and radioactive phosphorus can also be used for medical treatment. The scientists at the laboratory will study the slight differences in the radioactivity of the two elements. In the future, they hope to cooperate with hospitals abroad to jointly study radioactivity and make greater discoveries in arteriosclerosis, diabetes, and degenerative diseases. Scientists have already conducted regional experiments on the research of radioactive isotopes in agriculture. According to Dr. Morse, the director of Brookhaven, the future of agriculture is indeed exciting.

Research Objectives

Regarding the "atomic dreams" of many writers who have written about atomic energy, such as how to use an atomic engine as small as a broad bean to drive a ship across the Atlantic, although scientists have not yet studied it, Brookhaven scientists have been studying radioactive carbon for quite some time. Radioactive carbon is made from explosive gas and neutral electrons, so when the research is completed, it is expected to simplify oil refining methods.

According to Dr. Morse, Brookhaven has three goals:

(1) To thoroughly seek new knowledge to apply atomic energy to peace and happiness. (2) To train young scientists to continue working. (3) To eliminate the fear of "atoms" in humans.

Overcoming Psychological Fear

When the residents of Long Island, USA, heard the news that "an atomic research center was being built in Brookhaven," they said in horror that the radioactivity of the elements would kill Long Island's "flies," drive away Long Island's "ducks," destroy Long Island's soil, and make Long Island's coffee taste bitter. In fact, Brookhaven is not a bomb laboratory, and it is definitely not a military organization.

Brookhaven Laboratory has been in existence for more than a year. Although the equipment inside is not fully completed, the work is progressing steadily.

The institute currently employs more than 1,000 people, mostly local people from Long Island who are engaged in engineering work. They have overcome their fear of atoms and are engaged in building a huge nuclear reactor.

Two Hundred Scientists

There will be 200 scientists regularly studying at the laboratory, in addition to more than 200 trainees. They will be sent here from universities and educational institutions in the northeastern United States. Many of the scientists are members of the American Physical Society, chemical flavor experts, astronomers, and biochemists. Most of them are young people under the age of 40.

Relatively Free Control

Although the staff of the laboratory are strictly controlled by congressional regulations, especially in terms of atomic energy, which is required to be closely monitored, it is relatively free compared to military management, because the gate of the laboratory is guarded by only one police officer and a middle-aged native. Tourists can visit the area near the institute without any interference. In the location where atomic piles are manufactured, tourists, travelers, and other visitors must, of course, stop at a considerable distance, but all the public security regulations form a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere in Brookhaven.

Dr. Morse said: "When we started working, it was difficult for us to recruit scientists, because they were unwilling to work under government supervision. Therefore, we eradicated the shackles of supervision and developed a 'university-style freedom,' so the performance of the work has been quite excellent so far." (Translated by Guangxin)

### Fengxian Holds In-Kind Donation Drive to Stabilize the Lives of Public School Teachers and Staff

[Our Fengxian Dispatch, 10th] The county budget for the second half of this year has been completely disrupted due to drastic fluctuations in prices. In order to stabilize the living standards of public school teachers and staff and soldiers, the authorities have drafted a method for the people to donate goods in kind, which has been submitted to the County Assembly for a decision. The total tax amount for the county is 500,000 yuan, and four shi (pecks) of white rice will be donated for each yuan of tax. The collection will begin on January 5, 1938. The county will hire local people to form a committee to plan and handle the technical aspects of the collection. It is also understood that the county will implement a salary-in-rice system starting next year, with each civil servant receiving an average of 1.6 dan (160 liters) of white rice per month. From then on, their lives should be stabilized.

### Guizhou Province Adjusts County-Level Organizations and Will Increase Compensation

— Our Correspondent Liu Mengchi

[Our Guiyang Dispatch, 8th] One of the purposes of Guizhou Province's current adjustment of county-level organizations is to increase compensation, because the compensation of personnel in county-level organizations in border provinces is far lower than what people in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, etc. can imagine. Currently, county public school teachers and staff in nearby provincial capitals, such as secretaries and section chiefs, are considered quite prominent figures in the counties and townships, but their monthly income does not exceed six gold yuan. The current adjustment plan stipulates that, for staff positions, the base salary will be tentatively set at 10 gold yuan. For every 10 yuan above 10 yuan, 1 gold yuan will be issued. For example, if the base salary for a county government secretary or section chief at the first level of appointment is 200 yuan, they will receive a salary of 29 yuan. Counties with sufficient finances and higher living standards can increase this on their own, even to the point of matching provincial-level compensation, in order to achieve the goal of equal pay for equal work. For soldiers and police, the monthly food allowance is 1 yuan for staple food, 1 yuan for non-staple food, and 4 yuan for pay. The staple food allowance will be issued in kind according to a fixed quantity, and the proceeds will be transferred to the account. For technicians and corvée laborers, the monthly wage will be 5 yuan.

Reducing Redundancy and Rectifying Taxes

The Guizhou Provincial Government stipulates that the adjustment plan will be implemented from January 1938, but the provincial government issued the contents of the plan to the counties recently as the basis for preparing for implementation. After receiving the order, the counties immediately began to lay off personnel. The salaries of all those laid off will be paid until the end of this year to show compassion. At the same time, they will earnestly rectify various taxes and levies, thoroughly eliminate embezzlement, and eradicate tax evasion in order to increase revenue. If the counties can allocate a portion of business expenses in addition to adjusting the compensation of public school teachers and staff for the purpose of promoting various construction projects, it would be most appropriate and ideal. As for impoverished counties, the provincial government will find other ways to provide overall subsidies and hopes to achieve self-sufficiency in the short term.

Invigorating the Spirit and Abiding by the Law

In his final report, Mr. Gu said that the purpose of his drastic and reckless adjustment of county-level organizations was that in the past, there were often county magistrates and county-level personnel who were not diligent in their duties and were always perfunctory in local administration, or they used the excuse that their compensation was too low and not enough to make ends meet as a pretext for corruption and abuse of power. He said that if this bad atmosphere was not eradicated, the people's administration would not improve. As for the establishment of county-level organizations, in the past, most of them were people who did not know the situation at the grassroots level. Whenever the central government or the province needed to set up an organization to handle something, the county also had to set up an organization to handle it. Over time, the county-level organizations became overlapping and cumbersome, which was indeed the case. If they were not thoroughly adjusted, it would certainly not be possible for people of goodwill who sincerely wanted to do something to have the convenience of promoting their interests. Mr. Gu hopes that all county magistrates and county-level personnel in his province will invigorate their spirits and earnestly engage in their work from the date of the implementation of this adjustment plan. At the same time, county-level personnel should be honest and self-disciplined.

Ningxia's Land Reform Will Be Implemented First in Jinji County

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 12th] According to Kang Yushu, a member of the Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Border Area Supervisory Commission who recently returned from inspecting Ningxia, Ningxia's land reform has selected Jinji County and can be implemented next spring. In addition, there are also major decisions to establish collective farms and eliminate usury. He also said that Mi County is adjacent to bandit areas, so the grassroots organization and militia training are very strict, and the local area is relatively stable.

### Jiangxi Province Holds Granting of Land to Dependents of Soldiers

— Our Correspondent Liu Zao

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 10th] In order to promote conscription administration and find ways to support the families of soldiers who are fighting bandits, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has formulated methods for granting wasteland to the families of soldiers who are fighting bandits and for substitute farming. The methods stipulate that the target of those entitled to land grants shall be new conscripts recruited according to the conscription procedures, and the list of soldiers handed over by the county (city) government shall be the basis for allocating wasteland to their families. If those who voluntarily join the army, the certificate of soldiers directly participating in combat issued by the unit they serve in (military division or independent brigade) shall be used as a reference for allocation.

According to Article 4 of the original method, the standard for land allocation is: the direct relatives of the conscripts, such as grandparents, parents, spouses, children, and younger siblings (under the age of 18), shall be allocated no more than 5 mu (0.82 acres) per person. If they already have their own cultivated land, the amount shall be reduced accordingly to ensure that they can maintain a minimum standard of living.

The land allocated by each county (city) to the families of soldiers shall be all the cultivable wasteland and barren hills within the county. The township and village officials shall conduct a detailed survey. If it is privately owned, the government shall purchase it and return it to the public, and it shall be distributed evenly according to the number of soldier dependents in the local area. A portion shall be controlled for continued allocation. If the land in each county (city) is not sufficient for allocation, Article 6 of the original method stipulates as follows: The quantity of land owned by wealthy households in the local area shall be thoroughly investigated, and they shall be persuaded to give up a portion of the required land for allocation. The government shall purchase it at a fair price according to law to allocate to the families of soldiers who are fighting.

The local government shall issue an allocation certificate to the land allocated to the families of soldiers by the government. The soldier's family shall keep the certificate, and the land shall be exempt from land taxes and all other surcharges for five years from the date of allocation. After the expiration, the government shall take back the allocation certificate and exchange it for a formal management certificate (handled according to general regulations). This shall be considered as the ownership of the land, which is completely in the hands of the soldier's family. Therefore, the general collection of taxes shall also be based on the usual practice. However, if the soldier's family lacks the manpower to cultivate the land allocated by the government, the latter part of Article 7 of the original method stipulates: A substitute farming team shall be organized by the village, with the village chief as the captain and the neighborhood chief as the squad leader. All men within the village who are between the ages of 18 and 45 (excluding soldier dependents) shall be organized into the team and have the obligation to cultivate the land for the soldier dependents in this village (including all agricultural work).

The substitute farming team shall be led by the village chief, who shall be responsible for directing and substituting for the farming of the soldier dependents in this village. If any member of the team is unable to engage in farming, they may pay to hire a worker to substitute, but they may not substitute with the old, young, or those who are unable to perform labor. Article 10 stipulates that the substitute farming team shall not accept any remuneration or hospitality from the soldier dependents, except for cases where the soldier dependents voluntarily provide tea and water. If the soldier dependents lack the tools, fertilizer, and seeds needed for cultivation, the local village chief shall, at his discretion, provide funds or purchase them on their behalf, which shall be returned without interest after the autumn harvest. If there is a lack of draft cattle, the village chief shall borrow them fairly from families in the village who have draft cattle in accordance with Article 11 of the original method.

However, if the soldier dependent violates any of the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Soldiers and Their Families During the Mobilization Period (except for Article 14, paragraph 3), Article 14 of the original method clearly stipulates that the allocated land shall be completely recovered, and the benefits already obtained shall be recovered according to the severity of the circumstances and used as a subsidy for soldier dependents.

Dian-Qian-Gui Railway to Begin Construction Next Spring [Our Kunming Dispatch, 12th] The construction of the Dian-Qian-Gui Railway has been under discussion for a long time. The Ministry of Communications attaches great importance to this and has approved the allocation of 2.5 million gold yuan as initial engineering expenses. It has also ordered the establishment of a construction engineering team within the month, and full-scale construction will begin next spring.

### "Rickshaw Boy" to Be Filmed Is a Pipe Dream

"Moment in Peking" to Be Filmed Instead

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 12th] The filming of "Rickshaw Boy" has become a pipe dream. Huang Zongzhan recently sent a letter from the United States to Ms. Li Bingsun in Beiping (who was scheduled to play the actor Huzi) saying that Pan American Company believes that the book "Rickshaw Boy" is outdated and most people oppose its production. Huang himself does not intend to film it at his own expense due to the huge cost. However, Pan American Company is still considering filming a Chinese film, with Lin Yutang's "Moment in Peking" being the most promising.

### Miniature News

Zhenjiang

[Our Dispatch] The local newspapers here on the 10th published a letter from a reader stating that someone at No. 24 Shizi Street was hoarding more than 2,000 dan (200,000 liters) of rice. Chairman Ding read the newspaper and immediately ordered Xie Bi, the magistrate of Zhenjiang County, to investigate thoroughly. However, there was no No. 24 there, and no one nearby was hoarding rice. Later, the county government discovered that the inspection team of the Materials Adjustment Office had found a total of more than 2,000 dan (200,000 liters) of unregistered rice, paddy, and wheat in Wanyou and Xiehexiang Rice Mills on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 3rd of this month. Both mills claimed that it was public grain or military grain, but did not provide proof. The inspection team did not investigate further. Those who knew about this matter believed that it was hoarded by someone powerful. The newspaper reader's letter was a diversion. County Magistrate Xie Bi summoned rice merchants for a discussion on the evening of the 10th and ordered them to report their accounts and provide evidence, otherwise, he would order them to sell at a fixed price.

Jiangyin

[Our Dispatch] The Xi-Cheng Long-Distance Bus Company has reduced the number of trips starting on the 10th due to the lack of gasoline and the difficulty in purchasing damaged materials. It now runs once every hour. In recent times, passengers have been crowded, and there are many peddlers, which is a major threat to transportation between Cheng and Xi.

Luhe

[Our Dispatch] The Economic Supervisory Committee, which has been closed, has completed the handling of confiscated materials. Fifty percent will be used for the committee's public expenses, 30 percent will be used as bonuses for informants, and 2 percent will be used for local public works repairs.

Wuhu

[Our Dispatch] The Wuhu County Government previously announced restrictions on the export of materials, which will be lifted with immediate effect. In order to promote the smooth flow of goods, maintain the sales of legal merchants, and understand the market's surplus and deficit, items such as rice, rapeseed, soybeans, flour, and cotton yarn, in quantities of 50 dan (5,000 liters) or five pieces, must be registered and a registration certificate issued to facilitate circulation.

### Gold Yuan to Gold Note Ratio Revised, General Prices Decline, White Rice Traded at 600, Rice Supply Increases

After the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting passed the new ratio between the gold yuan and gold foreign currencies, various prices have stabilized. Yesterday, due to the Prime Minister's birthday holiday, all industries were closed, so there were no official quotations, but off-site bids were soft. Rice prices have improved due to the increase in peddlers shipping to Shanghai, and some rice shops also have rice to supply. The rice shortage has improved. White rice is quoted at 600 yuan per dan (100 liters), and peddlers are willing to sell. At the same time, the rice purchased by the Grain Emergency Procurement and Storage Association is being urged to ship, and is on the way and will arrive in Shanghai one after another, so the rice shortage problem can be gradually solved.

### Allowing Silver Dollars to Circulate: A Glimpse of the Financial Community's Attitude

[Our Dispatch] Since the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting decided the day before yesterday to allow silver dollars to circulate freely, adjust the official prices of gold and silver, and conditionally allow gold yuan notes to be exchanged for hard currency, people in the financial community here have taken a reserved attitude towards the possibility of stabilizing the currency value. They believe that if the Central Bank can exchange gold yuan and silver dollars at the prescribed exchange rate and supply them in large quantities so that hard currency can circulate in the market, it will contribute to the improvement of the currency's credibility.

At the same time, it is doubtful whether the provision in the new method for exchanging gold yuan notes for gold yuan can collect a large number of gold yuan notes under the current situation of tight silver.

### Restoring Free Market Trading: Prices Should Gradually Decline

After the authorities stipulated the implementation of "negotiated prices" and "cost-based pricing" based on the economic supplementary measures, all prices once formed a chaotic situation. The main reason was that after the opening of food self-application and purchase, rice prices soared, causing various prices to rise as well, so that it was impossible for various industries to trade according to negotiated prices. For example, in terms of general industrial finished products, factory negotiated prices were only a few times higher than the "819" limited price, while the retail price on the market exceeded more than ten times. Such an abnormal state made the "negotiated price" a mere formality and ineffective. The losses suffered by factories for other industrial finished products with "cost-based pricing" were even greater. According to the general opinion of the industrial community, under the current situation, the so-called "negotiated price" and "cost-based pricing" seem to be redundant. If the government can solve problems such as food regulation and raw material supply under the principle of stabilizing the economy, restoring free market trading across the board, then various prices will gradually decline, and the production of industrial cost goods can also tend to be normal.

### Mint to Start Work, Increase Minting of Gold and Silver Standard Coins, Factory Director Wei Flies to Beijing to Visit Finance Minister Xu

[Our Dispatch] Since the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting passed the amendment to the gold yuan note issuance method and decided to issue gold yuan coins made of gold and silver in addition to the gold yuan note, the minting work of the Central Mint after that will be to increase the minting of gold and silver standard coins in large quantities in addition to the auxiliary coins currently minted to meet the needs of circulation.

It is learned that Factory Director Wei flew to Beijing by plane yesterday morning. It is reported that the important task of this trip is to visit the newly appointed Finance Minister Xu Kan. However, it is generally speculated that it is related to asking for instructions on minting new coins.

According to Mr. Wei, before the factory receives new instructions, the auxiliary coins to be minted are still limited to the one-cent copper coin and the 50-cent silver coin.

Fifty-Cent Silver Coins Will Be Issued First

Another dispatch: The gold yuan note issuance method has been revised and it has been decided to mint gold yuan coins. The Central Mint has prepared to start minting new gold and silver coins. As soon as the new model of gold yuan from the Ministry of Finance and the official order arrive, minting can begin. Because the factory has complete equipment for minting coins, minting can begin at any time. As for the 50-cent silver coins that the factory has planned to mint, a considerable amount has already been minted. If the silver subsidiary coins can still be issued, they should be issued before the gold coins within days.

### Rice Market

— Xin Ren

In the past few days, the rice merchants' faces have shown a smug smile again. Early in the morning, everyone crowded at the market entrance, watching every incoming farmer's boat. As long as they spotted five dou or one shi (units of volume) of rice, they would wave and shout, "Come here, sell it to me! I guarantee you won't regret it!" Some, stamping their feet, anxiously cried, "What's wrong, Uncle Chun? Don't you recognize me anymore?" Even those with some self-awareness, when unable to attract customers, would gesture to indicate that rice prices had skyrocketed. Some would even use their fingers to quote shockingly high prices.

People from the rice shops were almost entirely mobilized, men and women alike, moving in a constant stream. However, their eyes were fixed on the farmers carrying loads on their shoulders. As soon as a bag of white rice appeared, many hands would simultaneously reach for it. Then, a chorus of "Old customer, sell it to me!" would erupt, leaving the villagers at a loss. In the end, the quick-witted naturally prevailed, snatching the bags and silently heading back to their shops.

Groups of customers in short jackets jumped down from the trains, like locusts chasing after rice. They emptied the white rice, then started buying unpolished rice. With a flick of the wrist, the merchants sold the twenty-yuan white rice for thirty yuan into the customers' bags. No matter how much you wanted, once it was sold, you wouldn't even be able to buy back the unpolished rice the next morning.

Today, the situation is a little different, because seventy or eighty short-jacketed customers arrived overnight and crowded among the rice merchants early in the morning, directly dealing with the farmers. White rice was received dou by dou, and the rice price suddenly jumped from thirty, to forty, to fifty. The merchants' shouts seemed less effective than the transient customers.

Then, some people started thinking about the livelihood of the locals. "At this rate, how can the poor survive!" So they started pushing and blocking them to the east side of the road. However, there were also villagers carrying rice to the market on that side, and they crowded around, begging, "Thank you, sell your rice to me!" The villagers naturally saw which way the wind was blowing and quoted very high prices, but after selling and entering the market, they realized they had been taken advantage of.

Everyone seemed to be going crazy for rice, staging scenes of tragicomedy. (Sent from Zhengyi)

### Old Haunts of Tianping

— Xi Hou

Tianping Mountain is also called "Fan Grave Mountain" by Suzhou people, who say that "Fan Wenzheng Gong" of the Song Dynasty is buried there. Later, it was learned that it was a mistake for Fan Xiweng's ancestral tomb. It is also said that a heavenly wind blew the mountain stones upright overnight, and the words "Ten Thousand笏朝天" (Ten Thousand Tablets Facing the Sky) are still on the mountain top to this day. Such a secluded and beautiful place, because the Fan family produced a few figures, was fabricated to be so rich and imposing, with a domineering aura. It really makes me a little resentful of this "poor village chief," even though it has nothing to do with him, and his lyrics are also very lovely. However, in my seven visits to Tianping, I never thought of going near the Fan Tomb to take a look, always going straight up the mountain.

The road to Tianping is roughly divided into two branches, one from Mudu and one from Fengqiao, with more people going from the former. My first visit was on a cold day. The water was shallow, the boat was slow, and I went from outside Xumen towards Fengqiao. I went ashore and ran before I was far from the mountain, crossing "Tongzi Gate" to climb the mountain. I only took that waterway once; it seemed too lonely. Going from Mudu involved crossing the back of Lingyan Mountain, passing through villages and houses, and approaching Tianping head-on. Once, from Mudu to Tianping, I crossed "Tongzi Gate" again, looking for a way to enter the city towards Fengqiao, which was more strenuous. The next time, I went the other way around, walking from Fengqiao to climb the mountain and going around to Mudu to take a boat back. Generally speaking, walking while playing on the mountain allows you to take in more scenery. Every five steps is a view, every ten steps a wonder. The scenery along the way is enough to compensate for the effort.

I remember the most satisfying time was hiking in a group. Stepping over the ancient Fengqiao, following the herringbone-shaped "Royal Passage," we first went to Guanyin Mountain, crossed Dachi Mountain, Hua Mountain, and climbed straight to the top of Tianping. Tianchi is famous for its stone peaks, magnificent and majestic, but remote and rarely visited. Legend has it that the Luomu Nunnery of the Ming Dynasty's Xu Yuan sighed was on Tianchi Mountain, which is the "Jiangdong Left a Xu Bi" in Qian Muqi's poem. The site is no longer traceable. I recently read a couplet in Liang's poem about falling leaves: "The desolate nunnery is gradually aging, Xu Yuan sighed, and the muddy wine is related to Cui Buli." The second line uses the "Huangye Sheng Duo Jiu Bu Ci" ("The sound of yellow leaves is loud, and I don't refuse wine") poetry of "Cui Huangye," both of which are praised as wonderful. I include this as an aside.

Tianping's stone bamboo shoots stand tall, covered in iron-like rust, some lying horizontally and vertically, in natural positions. Among the mountains in the southeast of Suzhou, Tianping is particularly unique and independent, and never gets old. A temple is hidden halfway up the mountain, with "Boyu Spring" water dripping all day long. Inside is the "Jianshan Pavilion," leaning on the pavilion to listen to the maple trees, completely forgetting worldly worries. In the late spring and early summer, sitting under the "Line of Sky," you can sometimes hear the "Wuchun" bird chirping in the mountain, its crisp sound penetrating the forest, rich in stone rhyme. Further up is "Middle White Cloud," a large stone protruding over a zhang (unit of length), covered in ancient moss. Lying prostrate on the stone, looking down at the maple forest, red leaves surged like a tide, and a goshawk swept past, touching its back with my hand. The highest point is "Upper White Cloud," with a panoramic view of the undulating distant mountains and the vast Lake Tai, standing alone in the vastness, and sorrow comes when the joy ends. Going back and forth in the mountains countless times, not only do the monks recognize my face, but the mountain birds welcome people. Leaning against the stone to find a chant, I also remembered Su Shi's line, "I already feel that the fishing stone is warm from coming so often."

Tianping's red leaves have become the target of autumn tourists. But Tianping's red maples are all hundreds of years old, standing tall in the valley, so huge that they can be embraced, with old branches and large, scattered leaves, turning bright as clouds and mist after frost. It is not like a single chicken maple tree in a hedge, adorning a cold and beautiful small scene.

It has been twelve years since I went to Tianping. Every time I think of it, I feel that the mossy stones and frosty forests emerge before my eyes. A few days ago, the children said they were going to Tianping for a hike, and I also told them not to forget to pick up a few red leaves to bring back.

### Lyrics of Haihonglou

— Banmeng

Tune: "Washing Brook Silk"

A skinny horse treads on the ancient plain in the west wind,
A desolate owl cries in an old house in the autumn mist.
The sound of water from the bridge where the boats return.
Lonely at dusk, I often sit alone.
Leaning on the painted railing, I cherish my remaining years,
And ask the vast sky with muddy wine.

Tune: "Fishing Boat Flute"

A cold eye to the river and sky,
A few pieces shattered and echoed in the vastness.
A fisherman on a sandbar in a single boat,
Fishing for the cold moon among the yellow reeds.
A good wind blows away half a bit of sorrow,
A little bit, it flickers and disappears.
Carrying brocade scales dipped in wine,
Playing the long flute with plum blossoms.

Tune: "Yu Meiren"

When will autumn come and spring go?
Let the years grow old at will.
Joys, sorrows, partings, and reunions are all empty,
But I believe that the rise and fall of ancient and modern times are the same.
Give up on striving in the world!
It's all predestined.
A thousand worries are locked in my brow,
I only fear that my life, like falling flowers, will lose its charm.

### Census

— Xiaoying

This time, the city implemented a general census, mobilizing more than 40,000 high school students and above to participate in the work. The author was also nominated by the school's training office and assigned to a certain Bao and Jia (administrative units) on Xujiahui Road in Changshu District to work as a "civil servant" for one night.

Sadly, the three yuan subsidy issued by the superiors was used up in buying two dry batteries that night, costing four yuan. I had to pay for the late-night snacks and transportation myself.

The Jia I was assigned to check had many so-called "prominent people." Before setting off, the Bao chief repeatedly told me to be careful, and the "implication" was naturally "understood."

Following Miss Jia Chang, I began to carry out my "official duties." The first few households I checked were tenement watchmen and small tailors at the entrance of the alley. Entering their low houses, chairs and tea were immediately offered, as if receiving a distinguished guest, with attentive hospitality, making me feel a little uneasy. Although it was a late autumn night, in that warm human atmosphere, I didn't feel any cold. After finishing the check, they saw me off with proper ceremony, and it could be said that "both host and guest were happy."

Next, I had to check the mansions of those "prominent people." The Bao chief's words were still in my ears, and I felt apprehensive, more troubled than solving a difficult math problem.

The mansions of the "prominent people" were indeed extraordinary. Acting "carefully" as instructed by the Bao chief, I managed to get through it smoothly. However, I gradually felt the loneliness of being at a high place.

At the mansion of one "prominent person," perhaps they were sound asleep. Miss Jia Chang knocked her royal arm sore before someone came out to open the door. We waited in the living room for more than ten minutes before they finally arrived, throwing down their old and new ID cards and index cards. They paid no attention to me, a student whose status was less than one percent of theirs, as if blaming me for disturbing their good dreams. The coldness was ten times colder than the Siberian climate, almost freezing my blood. If it weren't for the amiable and kind smile of Miss Jia Chang, I would have really wanted to emulate Guan Yu's "hanging up his seal and retiring with gold."

Turning it over in my mind, "prominent people" mostly act like this. This is their so-called pretense, and it's not directed specifically at me. Ah Q was resurrected in my heart. Fortunately, this "spiritual comfort" made me feel relaxed and happy, and my steps were lighter on the way home. Otherwise, I might have collapsed halfway.

### Wedding Invitation

— Shan Shi

A few days ago, I received a wedding invitation from a relative. To be honest, the bright red color was rather jarring, and it meant I had to give a gift again.

Unfortunately, this is a Chinese custom, and it is not easy to reduce it for a while. In fact, holding a wedding is both a waste of money and effort for the parties involved, and even more of a loss for the guests. The ladies refuse to attend the banquet without wearing a brand-new dress. Imagine how wasteful this is!

Let's talk about the wedding invitation.

Before the war, when I was studying at the Shanghai Municipal Council's Li Hua Tong Public School, a teacher held a wedding. The English headmaster, Mr. Robert, also received a wedding invitation, but the foreigner didn't understand what it was, so he asked a clerk in the registry office. Perhaps this gentleman was faithful to the original text, and he translated it like this: "Please have your whole family come to visit this wedding ceremony." This made Headmaster Robert scratch his head in a hurry, saying, "What should I do? My wife is in London, my children are studying in America, and my daughter can't be notified because she's with her husband in Belgium!" As a result, he wrote a very solemn letter of apology to the teacher. This is a joke caused by "阖第光临" (please grace us with your family's presence).

There is also a special type of wedding invitation where the wedding location is not in the city, yet it still says "恭请光临" (respectfully invite your presence). I think very few guests would travel from other places to attend!

There is also a wedding announcement in the newspaper. In addition to the date, location, and "respectfully invite your presence," there is also a sentence that says, "恕不另柬" (no separate invitations will be sent). However, in reality, most of those who attend the ceremony have received wedding invitations.

### Introducing the "China Yearbook"

— Bin Zhi

The 1948 "China Yearbook" has been published and is sold by the Zhonghua Book Company. The data used in the book is mainly from 1947, and some data after 1947 is also collected, so the content is the latest. The sources of all data have been carefully investigated and statistically analyzed, so they are accurate and reliable.

The entire book, including the appendix, is divided into 40 chapters, with the order of arrangement based on the responsible businesses of various government departments. In terms of nature, it can be divided into seven categories: general, political, international, military, economic, social, and cultural. The general chapters include geography, administrative regions, population, and religion and language. The political chapters include constitutionalism, political parties, the National Assembly, the central political system, the local political system, legislation, judiciary, examinations, supervision, internal affairs, Mongolian-Tibetan affairs, and overseas Chinese affairs. The international chapters include diplomacy and international relations. The military chapters include national defense and the Red Peril and bandit suppression. The economic chapters include transportation, economic policy, finance, banking, commerce, agricultural economy, forestry and fishery, land reclamation, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, food, land administration, water conservancy, industry, and mining. The social chapters include society, post-war relief, and health. The cultural chapters include education, academics, and news and broadcasting. There is also an appendix at the end.

This is the first "China Yearbook" compiled by the China Yearbook Society. Therefore, in addition to detailing the current situation, the materials also include a brief history of the past. This material may seem redundant in other countries, but it is very useful in China because the yearbooks published in our country in the past mostly failed to be published annually. The chronology of major events in the appendix includes not only domestic and foreign events in 1947 but also a list of major events from the first year of the Republic of China to 1946, which is of great help for inspection.

Finally, I hope that the "China Yearbook" can abide by the name "Yearbook" and be published annually to promote the new and bring forth the old, so that new data is available at any time. This will not only leave a record in the literature, but also serve as a compass for national construction and social progress.

### Seize Time

— Tan Ke

The proverb says, "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold." It also says, "Time is money." And "Provide for a rainy day." It can be seen the importance of seizing time. This saying did not begin today, but it is even more apparent today that it is true.

According to reports, because the emergency relief requested by the employees of the two railway lines was not resolved smoothly, they went on a full-scale slowdown. Traffic on the two lines was interrupted for five hours, and there was chaos at the North Station, and accidents occurred in many places along the line.

The authorities certainly cannot be unaware of the employees' difficulties, and they certainly cannot ignore them. If they had given them considerable assistance before the request was launched, so that all or part of the difficulties could be resolved, then from a human perspective, the employees would definitely feel happy, and their work efficiency would inevitably increase. Timely help is the best way to win people's hearts. However, they did not do this. After the request for "emergency relief" was made, they still wanted to delay it. As a result, the employees went on a full-scale slowdown, and traffic on the two railway lines was interrupted for five hours, and so on...

This is just one example of the many events currently happening in our country, and it is a concrete illustration of the Chinese people's disregard for seizing time. You think: When a person's reason is controlled by hunger, what will they do? Will suppression have a thorough effect? What's the use of blaming this or blaming that? The important thing is to face the facts, plan for them in advance, then big things can be turned into small things, and small things can be turned into nothing.
