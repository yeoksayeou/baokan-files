### Please Eliminate Communist Bandits and Stabilize the Rear Order - The Executive Yuan Promulgates Items Requiring Attention: Those Encouraging Strikes and Impairing Production Shall Be Sent to Special Criminal Courts for Handling. Strict Prohibition of Student Strikes, Parades, Mass Gatherings, and Petitions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] It is reported that, in view of the fact that communist bandits have secretly planted spies in our rear areas, taking the opportunity to incite chaos and attempt to open up their so-called "second front" to echo the bandit army, the government shares the indignation of frontline soldiers and the general public. Recently, student and worker unrest has occurred repeatedly in various places, with professional students occupying schools, manipulating the masses, and engaging in wanton riots, which have a serious impact on social order. On the 17th, the Executive Yuan issued orders to the local administrative and security organs, listing the items requiring attention for quelling the chaos in the rear, and instructed the relevant agencies to thoroughly eliminate the communist bandits and stabilize the rear order in accordance with criminal laws and regulations. The full text is as follows:

Upon investigation, the communist bandits are wantonly wreaking havoc and endangering the country. They not only resort to armed robbery and arson everywhere, but also secretly plant spies in our rear areas, taking the opportunity to instigate trouble. They either launch student and worker unrest, plotting riots, or spread rumors to undermine security. The relevant agencies have either failed to take strict precautions or have failed to seriously investigate and punish. At this time of comprehensive suppression of the rebellion, stabilizing order and eliminating communist bandits are essential for protecting the safety of the people and defending the foundation of the country. Therefore, the following four points are listed regarding the items requiring attention in the rear during the period of quelling the rebellion: (1) In accordance with Article 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, when judicial police agencies legally arrest defendants, if there are indeed facts to believe that someone is committing a crime inside and the situation is urgent, they may directly search residences or other places without a search warrant. However, places that should be kept secret for military purposes may not be searched without the permission of the relevant commander, and no unwarranted disturbance should be caused to maintain order. (2) With regard to the acts of bandits inciting strikes and other acts sufficient to impair production, close contact should be made with the competent administrative organs to strictly prohibit them. Those who violate the prohibition shall be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for handling in accordance with the law. (3) With regard to students in various schools who, with the intention of obstructing the quelling of the rebellion, engage in strikes, parades, mass gatherings, and petitions, disrupting public order, or who incite through writing or oral persuasion, propagating for the bandits, and undermining order, they should be resolutely prohibited, stopped, or dispersed. Important current offenders should be arrested and sent to the Special Criminal Court for handling in accordance with the law. (4) Responsible personnel of all agencies, organizations, and schools shall be truly responsible for maintaining order in their agencies, organizations, and schools. If they discover anyone inside who is plotting the acts listed in the preceding two items, they shall report to the local security organs and assist in collecting evidence as much as possible. Those who violate this shall be punished.

### Investigation of the "July 5th" Incident Completed - The Executive Yuan Decides to Handle with Caution. Qin Dechun Yesterday Visited Weng Wenhao to Report on His Mission

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] Qin Dechun, Deputy Minister of National Defense, flew back to Nanjing on the 17th with Vice President Li. Before leaving, he told reporters that he had originally intended to return to Nanjing later, but Minister He relayed the President's order by long-distance telephone on the 16th, requiring him to return to Nanjing on the 16th. However, he could not make it that day. Whether he would go to Guling would depend on the orders he received after visiting President Weng in Nanjing. He said: "I am only responsible for the investigation. I am unwilling to participate in opinions on how to handle it. I firmly believe that my investigation report is absolutely fair, with equal emphasis on science and technique. I have asked the government to pay attention to the resettlement of displaced students. However, the report failed to pinpoint the exact responsibility for the so-called first shot and the student seizure of guns. The first shot may be impossible to determine, so both sides of the evidence are listed in the report." Regarding the issue of responsibility, Qin said: "Commander-in-Chief Fu has no major responsibility, but because he is the highest responsible person in North China, he is very concerned. Commander-in-Chief Chen Jicheng expressed that as long as it is beneficial to the country, he is willing to let the central authorities handle it." Regarding the 208th Division, Qin said: "The division commander may have no responsibility."

Who Fired the First Shot? No Definite Evidence

Qin spent a total of eleven days in Beiping. In addition to visiting military and political circles, the council, students, and journalists in Beiping, he also personally inspected the scene several times. He obtained a great deal of information about the situation on that day. As for who fired the first shot and the reason for the shooting, the information provided by all parties was different, but there was a lack of definite evidence, so it was still impossible to make a concrete judgment. When Qin left Beiping, he exchanged views with Supervisors Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui, who were sent by the Supervisory Yuan to Beiping to investigate the "July 5th" incident, and asked the two supervisors to collect more information for comparison. Gu and Hu will also return to Nanjing in a day or two.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] President Weng telegraphed the Northeast Suppression Headquarters on the 16th, stating: "According to Deputy Minister Qin Dechun's investigation report, the truth of the 'July 5th' incident is that most of the responsibility has been determined, and the handling method will be decided in the near future.

### Supervisors' Report Completed - Believed to Be Fairly Resolved

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] Supervisors Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui issued a public statement on the 17th regarding the investigation work of the "July 5th" incident, stating: "The 'July 5th' incident occurred more than a month ago.

Therefore, at the beginning of the month, Deputy Minister Qin Dechun of the Ministry of National Defense was sent to Beiping to investigate. The Supervisory Yuan also sent Fengxiang and Wenhui to Beiping based on the resolution of the General Assembly, using the Supervisory Yuan's solemn position and legal perspective to investigate the truth of the case and whether the local responsible officials had any improper handling and dereliction of duty, so as to handle it according to law. After more than ten days of investigation, based on the information provided by fair local gentlemen, Chinese and foreign reporters present, and Chinese and foreign individuals, as well as the reports and documents of relevant agencies, we have conducted analysis and research with an objective and calm attitude, and have inspected the scene several times and inquired about relevant personnel, and have obtained the truth. In addition to telegraphing the main points and handling opinions of this case to the Supervisory Yuan for verification, a detailed report has also been completed, and we will return to Nanjing in the next few days to report on our mission. We believe that this case will definitely be fairly resolved in the near future."

### Trade Limit with Japan - Executive Yuan Approves Relaxation - Private Business Representatives to be Dispatched Every Three Months

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] Ministry of Industry and Commerce News: Trade between our country and Japan is gradually developing, which domestic industrial and commercial circles highly value, and many have requested to participate. However, the current regulations in our country on the trade limit with Japan are considered too narrow and insufficient to meet the needs of the national industrial and commercial circles. It seems appropriate to relax them. In view of this, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce previously submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, proposing that private business representatives to Japan be dispatched every three months, with 60 to 100 people in each batch, and the duration of their stay in Japan would be appropriately extended based on actual needs. We have now received an order from the Executive Yuan stating, "The quota of representatives should be changed to 50 to 80 people per batch, and the rest should be handled as requested."

### Explanation of the Reduction in Public Utility Price Hikes - A Sincere Appeal for the Central Government to Pay Attention to This Issue -

The issue of price increases by the eight major public utility companies in Shanghai in August caused a great stir in the city a few days ago, as if a major unexpected event was about to occur. The new prices for August increased three or fourfold for each company, with some reaching nearly ten million times the pre-war prices, causing the general public to feel threatened in their lives. Not only did they find it psychologically unbearable, but most people simply could not afford it. Therefore, there was a brewing resistance movement among the people to refuse payment. Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Council, representing five million people in Shanghai, considered both the livelihood of the citizens and the maintenance of social order, and felt that a more reasonable solution should be found in any case. Therefore, it convened a temporary meeting on the 15th and immediately decided on three measures to reduce the new prices. Fortunately, Mayor Wu, in implementing the plan, spared no effort in persuading the company authorities together with the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Council and the convener of the Public Utilities Committee, as well as various councilors, in the past two days. Although the company representatives initially firmly refused to reduce prices, they were finally moved by the Mayor, Speaker, and others. After the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council jointly assumed responsibility for requesting a loan from the Central Bank to cover the shortfall in revenue for August, the company representatives resolutely accepted the price reduction in order to maintain the livelihood of the citizens and social order. This major event, which could have led to unexpected turmoil, was spared from reaching a deadlock.

We are extremely impressed with the Mayor's patience in this matter, and we also truly recognize that the Municipal Council, as an organ, fulfilled its responsibility as representatives of the citizens and made an impartial resolution.

Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau were subjected to excessive criticism from the outside world at the beginning of this incident, but they were able to endure hardship and work hard to mediate. It is difficult to have such patience without deeply understanding the samadhi of endurance. Many things in the world cannot be accomplished without going through countless twists and turns and being tempered thousands of times. Therefore, those who merely act on a momentary impulse are not enough to talk about this. The Mayor had already anticipated in early June that public utilities would have price adjustments that citizens could not afford and firmly telegraphed the central government to resign. However, because it was not approved, he devoted himself to solving the problem. It can be seen that the Mayor was by no means only concerned about the company's side and ignored the burden on the citizens. The Municipal Council had already made statements and appeals to the central government twice, in March and June, on how to stabilize public utility prices, and in fact, they have repeatedly consulted with the municipal authorities to negotiate loans and purchase foreign exchange to pre-purchase fuel. This is enough to prove that they, as councilors, do not simply reduce the burden on the citizens and ignore the difficulties of the company's business operations. Now, finally, all the companies have reined in and accepted the Municipal Council's resolution and the Mayor's concrete implementation plan. The sparks of fire are unlikely to start a prairie fire. We congratulate Shanghai here and also congratulate the whole country!

However, the problem has not been completely solved and still requires full understanding and decisive action by the central and local authorities and all citizens to weigh the priorities.

We must first point out that the reason for the excessive price increases of public utilities lies less in the public utilities themselves and more in the continuous increase in foreign exchange rates, the sharp rise in general prices, and the daily depreciation of the currency, which are all links in a serious general economic problem. Public utilities seem to not have enough revenue to cover their expenses, but general industries and businesses and citizens really feel unable to bear the burden, especially most people who rely on wages for their livelihoods. Therefore, the responsibility for remedying the difficulties of public utilities cannot be completely attributed to the local authorities. Moreover, the skyrocketing prices of public utilities, such as human service prices, will inevitably affect general prices, and the result of skyrocketing general prices will hurt the national treasury the most. Therefore, it is the central government's natural and inescapable responsibility to stabilize the prices of public utilities.

Secondly, it must be pointed out that the reason for this dispute, which almost caused a huge uproar, is that an additional 50% was added to the July index in the formula for calculating prices. Regardless of whether this is reasonable or not, since it is a formula, why change and add to it arbitrarily? Conversely, why can't the citizens demand changes and reductions? The company originally requested to prepay a certain amount, and the municipal government made this suggestion to accommodate the facts. However, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce subsequently filed the case without any consideration, and even promoted this bad example to various places. They held great power but never considered the people's ability to bear the burden, which is truly regrettable. Now that the 50% has been canceled, the new prices can be reduced. If the companies really have a shortage of funds in August and cannot make ends meet, the central government, for the sake of expediency and to eliminate hidden dangers, should give full sympathetic consideration to the compromise plan and emergency appeal of the municipal government and municipal council, and use loan methods to overcome the difficulties of August. As for the prices starting in September, it is hoped that the Public Utility Open Investigation and Review Committee of this city will be established this afternoon and actively start work, so that there will be more reasonable regulations by the beginning of next month. At the same time, it is also hoped that the citizens will share the difficulties, trust this review mechanism, and do their best to plan for the daily needs of the citizens, such as water, electricity, and transportation, while taking both sides into consideration. All threatening and激烈的言論 and actions should be avoided at this time, and we should wait for the fair handling of the review committee, and not be taken advantage of by those with ulterior motives to incite them.

Finally, we especially want to ask the central government to pay attention to this problem in Shanghai! Because if this problem cannot be solved fairly and reasonably and forces the people to be unable to bear the burden, it may cause water and electricity outages, industrial and commercial stagnation, a sharp increase in unemployment, and social unrest. If Shanghai reaches this state, is this what the central government expects? Stability is the first priority in suppressing chaos; production is the most important thing in the economy. The relationship between Shanghai and the overall situation of the country is by no means comparable to that of an ordinary city or town. How to maintain social stability and how to keep production uninterrupted must start with the government and the people working together to maintain public utilities, and each public utility company should also organize its business and fulfill its responsibilities!

### Hubei Education Director Wang Wenjun Ordered to Reorganize Hubei Normal College - Measures for Relieving Henan Province's Refugee Students Agreed Upon

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The National Hubei Normal College has been ordered to disband and reorganize due to student brawls. The college's President Wang Zhifu's firm resignation has been approved, and a reorganization committee has been established, headed by Hubei Education Director Wang Wenjun, to take over the college's affairs and thoroughly reorganize it.

[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 17th] After Vice Minister Hang exchanged views with relevant parties on the disbandment of the National Hubei Normal College, a reasonable solution may be obtained through the following channels: (1) The disbandment order must still be implemented thoroughly, but the school will relax the standards during re-registration so as not to create too many problems. (2) The 25 students accused of destroying residences will mostly be given a non-prosecution disposition after court interrogation due to insufficient evidence. (3) Wang Zhifu's intention to resign is very firm, and candidates for president and school affairs reorganizer will be selected separately. (4) Although the students have expressed opposition to the disbandment, there have been no excessive actions due to public opinion and fair comments from all walks of life. Furthermore, Vice Minister Hang has repeatedly stated that he will handle the matter based on the principle of caring for young people, so the general reaction is good. The plan to petition in Beijing is expected to be cancelled.

[Another Dispatch] Vice Minister Hang continued to discuss relevant educational issues with all parties on the 17th, and met with representatives of Henan province's refugee students again at 10:00 a.m., announcing the current relief measures. It has been agreed that the Central China剿匪 Headquarters and the Hankou Municipal Government will jointly be responsible for raising funds with the Henan Association of Fellow Villagers in Hankou to provide food. After they return to Beijing, they will submit a request to the central government to allocate funds from the Hankou Relief Special Donation to provide relief. It is said that the representatives are quite satisfied. However, the accommodation is increasingly insufficient and needs assistance from all parties. Hang is scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 18th to report back.

[Another Dispatch] Regarding the reorganization of Hubei Normal College and the relief of refugee students from Henan province who have come to Hankou, Vice Minister Hang has agreed on the following measures with the relevant authorities: (1) The Hubei Normal College Reorganization Committee will be composed of nine members, including Xu Huizhi, Chen Shi, Gong Wenjun, and Wang Zhifu, with Wang Wenjun (Director of Education) as the convener, to discuss proper reorganization measures immediately, but the college will not be closed down. (2) In addition to temporarily providing food and lodging for refugee students from Henan province, it has also been decided that the provincial and municipal education authorities will consider the situation of various schools in Wuhan and first arrange for some of them to study, and the remaining will be properly resolved after Hang returns to Beijing. After Vice Minister Hang announced the measures for handling Hubei Normal College, the students of the college still had some objections. Students from the Physical Education College, Art College, Huazhong University, Wuhan University, and other schools organized the "United Association to Protest the Ministry of Education's Unreasonable Disbandment of Hubei Normal College" this afternoon, demanding that the Ministry of Education withdraw its order and not sacrifice students under the pretext.

Director of the National Taxation Administration Jiang Shuge personally received them and promised to designate someone to re-examine the dismissed list to ensure it is done fairly, but withdrawing the order is impossible. The dismissed employees have established an association and entertained reporters on the afternoon of the 17th, believing that downsizing and reducing government are something they should support, but why is a Suppression of Rebellion Committee established, wasting national funds in vain! They also presented a lot of information regarding the unfairness and unreasonableness of this layoff.

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch on the 17th] The layoff dispute at the Jiangdu National Taxation Collection Bureau has escalated.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 17th] After the end of the Beiping 行轅, the scenic spot of Zhongnanhai has become the focus of attention of all levels. The municipal government and the North China剿匪 Headquarters negotiated to reopen it as a park and scheduled it to open on the 15th, but because Shanxi University occupied Yingtai, followed by the entire Beiping Special Criminal Court moving in on the 16th and occupying Jinggu, plus more than 200 households of military officers and their families from the former 行轅 still have not moved out, and some people who have not been permitted have moved in, and there are rumors that the destruction of various famous places is very serious. All kinds of incidents have not been resolved reasonably, and the municipal authorities are quite troubled. Therefore, the Zhongnanhai of today has become a disaster-ridden place. The shortage of housing in Beiping is a serious problem. The municipal authorities have recently decided to adjust it and will start investigating vacant houses soon, and strictly stipulate that each landlord is only allowed to occupy ten rooms as a base number for every two people, and one room will be added for each additional person. If they do not rent it out themselves after the investigation, they will be forced to rent it out. If this measure can be implemented thoroughly, the disputes over the occupation of public housing may be resolved.

### Ironclad Proof of Communist Spies Manufacturing Student Unrest (Part 1)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The relevant authorities have recently released an article containing ironclad proof of communist spies inciting pure students to create student unrest. The original text is as follows:

I. The Communist Youth Movement Organization and Its International Background

The communist party's youth movement work, which deceives young people, is directly planned and led by the communist party's "Central Youth Department," with the "Youth Work Committee" of the bogus China Democratic League headquarters as its peripheral leadership center. Its core organization is the "Democratic Youth League." The Chinese "Democratic Youth League" is a constituent unit of the Comintern's Red Youth International organization, the "World Federation of Democratic Youth," with its headquarters in Harbin. Recently, to facilitate the direct rule of youth in the communist areas, the "Democratic Youth League" organizations within the communist areas were renamed "Mao Zedong Youth League." Furthermore, spies and students lurking in government areas were used to establish various national student organizations, forming new national youth peripheral organizations that directly received the instigation and guidance of the communist "Central Youth Department."

As for the national student organizations established by communist spies under the orders of the communist party, the "Kunming Student Union," formed using the so-called "December 1st" incident, was the beginning of their use of student inter-school organizations to create student unrest and expand their influence. Therefore, in the spring of the 35th year (1946), the hidden communist spies and peripheral student groups of the China Democratic League in various schools in Shanghai jointly formed the "Shanghai Student Organizations Federation" (abbreviated as "Xuetuanlian"), participating in the "Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Petition Movement to Nanjing" on June 23rd of that year. This "Xuetuanlian" organization was the foundation for the development of the communist party's national student union organization in the future. In January of the 36th year (1947), the communist party used the Shen Chong case in Beiping to launch a national anti-American movement, successively organizing inter-school organizations called "XX City Student Union to Protest American Atrocities" throughout the country. Among them, Shanghai, Chongqing, Beiping, and Kunming were the most active. In March of the same year, under the direct instruction of the communist party's "Central Youth Department," communist spies actively instigated and contacted various regional "Anti-Tyranny Alliances" to secretly establish the so-called "National Student Anti-Tyranny Federation" in Shanghai to coincide with the convocation of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. This organization was, in fact, the beginning of the communist party's use of hidden communist spies in government areas to openly conduct national student organizations. The endless student unrest that followed was centered around this large-scale instigation.

After the establishment of the "National Anti-Tyranny Federation," its central task was to strive for the leadership of student self-government associations in major specialized schools and above in various regions, and to actively prepare for the so-called "anti-hunger," "anti-civil war," and "rescue education crisis" May student unrest. On May 20th of that year, professional students in the Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hangzhou, and Bian districts instigated the selection of so-called student representatives to march and petition in Beijing, formally directing the so-called "May 20th" incident. At the same time, communist spies unscrupulously spread conspiracies and launched a national "general strike" on June 2nd to test their dominance in the national student camp. Fortunately, with the local security authorities taking various preventive measures and guidance in advance, and with the majority of good students understanding the righteousness, this conspiracy failed to succeed. However, communist spies took this opportunity to convene the "National Student Representative Conference" in Shanghai in mid-June, with representatives from communist spies in various regions participating. During the meeting, it was decided to reorganize the original "National Anti-Tyranny Federation" into the bogus "All-China Students' Federation" (abbreviated as "Zhongguo Xuelian") as the central organization for their long-term instigation of student unrest, inducing young students to participate in the communist rebellion. The original regional "Anti-Tyranny Alliances" were also reorganized into regional bogus "Xuelian" at the same time. Its organizational system can be represented as follows: World Federation of Democratic Youth, Red International Student Union, the bogus Zhongguo Xuelian, under the "Council" are - Shanghai Xuelian "Council Member" and Secretariat - Nanjing Xuelian "Council Member" - North China Xuelian "Council Member" - Zhejiang Xuelian "Council Member" - Jiangsu Xuelian "Council Member" - Wuhan Xuelian "Council Member" - Kunming Xuelian "Council Member" - Henan Xuelian - Northwest Xuelian (preparation began in the spring of the 37th year) - Hong Kong Office (contact with the communist party and the International Communist Party, transmitting orders and leading student groups of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia). Underneath are the University Federation, Middle School Federation (student self-government associations of various schools controlled by communist professional students, various student groups of communist professional students).

After the establishment of the bogus "Zhongguo Xuelian," in addition to directly receiving orders from the "Central Youth Department" and cooperating with the communist armed rebellion to carry out various conspiratorial activities to disintegrate the government's rear, it also closely linked with the Red "International Student Union," which the Comintern used to incite young people in various countries to betray their motherland, becoming one of the units of this international conspiracy organization. On the 2nd of this month, the bogus "Zhongguo Xuelian," "Democratic Youth League," and the Democratic League's "Youth Work Committee" presumptuously dispatched representatives to India under the name of "Chinese Youth Delegation" to participate in the "World Federation of Democratic Youth Founding Congress" and the "Southeast Asia Democratic Youth Congress" convened by the "International Student Union." After the meeting, Qian Cunsu, sent by the bogus "Xuelian," was stationed in Prague as the Chinese Vice Chairman of the "International Student Union" and the so-called "Minister of Colonial and Semi-Colonial Territories." The "World Federation of Democratic Youth" and the "International Student Union" organizations are not only peripheral organizations for the Comintern to organize communist youth in various countries, but are also directly led by the "Committee of Youth Against Fascism of a Certain Country." The bogus "Zhongguo Xuelian" did not hesitate to openly send representatives to participate and openly accept its leadership, which is sufficient proof that communist spies sold out their country, helped the communist party to be abusive, and carried out a conspiracy to communize all Chinese youth, which is obvious. Furthermore, the fact that the so-called "International Student Union" Secretary Blackman openly came to our country in May of this year via Southeast Asia and Hong Kong to inspect the student movement conducted by the bogus "Zhongguo Xuelian" in the areas of Beiping, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing, and was warmly welcomed by professional students everywhere, and that the "International Student Union" openly claimed that it would convene a conference in August of this year to discuss "how to strengthen the Chinese student movement," fully proves the trinity of communist spies, the communist party, and the communist youth international, colluding with each other. (To be continued)

### Moscow Negotiations Still Deadlocked: Three-Nation Envoys Plan to See Stalin Again

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast: A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated at a press conference, "I hope that the envoys of the three nations, Britain, America, and France, will meet with Molotov again. Monday's meeting was not the last." According to informed sources, it is speculated that the three-nation envoys will meet with Stalin again in the near future.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] Individuals close to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the three-nation envoys' audience with Stalin was not intended to bypass Molotov to appeal to a higher authority, but to report the results of their talks with his Foreign Minister. It is reported that both sides have agreed to hold a four-power conference to discuss the principles of the German issue, and the date will be decided in the near future.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] British envoy to the Soviet Union, Roberts, regarding the Moscow negotiations, sent another report to the British Foreign Office this morning. After receiving the notification, Foreign Secretary Bevin and Minister for German Affairs Strullung immediately conferred with the American Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, and the French Ambassador, Massigli. The British Foreign Office expects further negotiations between the three-nation representatives in the Soviet Union and Molotov in the coming days.

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Former Washington diplomatic circles rumored that the three nations, Britain, America, and France, had agreed in principle that if the Soviet Union could lift the Berlin blockade, it would stop forming another West German government. A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office denied this rumor today, saying that the positions of the three nations, Britain, America, and France, have not changed.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 17th] According to unconfirmed reports, the Western three nations have agreed to consider the possibility of ending the occupation within one year after the signing of the peace treaty under certain conditions.

[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] Experts from the Western six nations will hold a meeting in September to formulate the regulations for the international co-management of the Ruhr area. According to a spokesperson for the French Foreign Office, the location of the meeting has not been determined, and the convening of the meeting is based on the provisions of the London Agreement. The announcement of this meeting by the Western countries indicates that they will continue to push forward with the co-management of the Ruhr area regardless of Soviet opposition. Informed sources here stated that the Soviet Union favors temporarily shelving or even abandoning the Ruhr control plan, and the announcement of the meeting's convening comes after six meetings between the envoys of Britain, America, and France and Molotov.

### The Soviet Union Adopts Various Measures to Unilaterally Rule Berlin: The Division of Municipal Institutions Continues to Expand

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] The Times today carried a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating: "I learned from a non-partisan individual" that the German administrative authorities in the Soviet occupation zone expect that before September, Berlin will not only be ruled by one nation but also by "one political party alone." The correspondent stated, "According to this individual's opinion, the measures that the Soviet Union is currently taking and other subsequent measures it will take in Berlin are aimed at making people believe that the control of the German capital has already been handed over to the other side." Under these circumstances, the Western powers, who have become guests, could be allowed to continue to station representatives or even troops in Berlin, and they could also be allowed to enjoy certain conveniences in transporting supplies after the resumption of railway traffic.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 17th] The Soviet military commander in Berlin, Kotikov, wrote to the mayor of Berlin, Mrs. Schroder, on the 17th, stating that the Berlin Municipal Council's recognition of the non-communist independent trade union as a legitimate collective bargaining institution was an "illegal action." The communist labor bureau chief, Schmidt, had previously threatened to deny the decision of the Municipal Council and split the Berlin Labor Bureau into two. Kotikov's intervention essentially endorsed Schmidt's threat. The Soviet-affiliated newspapers are fiercely opposing the Municipal Council's movement, and Kotikov's letter is adding insult to injury. The police and food bureaus of the Berlin municipal government have already been split into two, and Kotikov's actions have deepened the division.

### Soviet Troops Actively Mobilizing on the Border of the British Occupation Zone

British Protest Against Soviet Aircraft's Mock Attacks

[Associated Press, Frankfurt, 16th] It is reported that Soviet troops are continuing their actions in the Luneburg area, east of the British-Soviet border. The concentration of troops and supplies is intensifying near Arenz, and watchtowers have also been built along the line.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 16th] Today, two Soviet fighter jets made mock attacks on British transport planes that frequently traveled in the air corridor. Britain has lodged a strong protest with the Soviet Union.

### Clay Declares He Will Not Resign

[Associated Press, Frankfurt, 17th] General Clay, the commander of the American forces stationed in Germany, stated on the 17th that even if the highest authorities in Washington decided to abandon the West German government that he initiated, he would not resign. Clay stated at a press conference, "I have served in the military for 34 years, and I have never failed to execute any order from the government, nor have I ever resigned because I could not execute any order. I will continue to do so now."

### Economic Situation Deteriorates in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast from Berlin: The economic situation in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany is deteriorating. It is reported that workers at the Krupp factory have gone on strike in protest of food shortages. Factories and stores in the Soviet occupation zone have been forced to close due to a lack of raw materials and goods. Coal and steel from the Ruhr area have disappeared due to the Western nations' suspension of trains. This is a countermeasure by the Western nations against the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin.

### Drafting of New Danube River Convention Nearing Completion: British, American, and French Setbacks

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast from Belgrade. The work of drafting a new convention for the Danube River is nearing completion. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky accused Western nations of attempting to undermine the drafting of the new convention. The three nations Britain, America and France suggested that the new convention needed approval of 11 countries including Austria and the three powers before it could come into effect, but it was rejected by a vote of seven to three. Conversely, the Soviet Union suggested that the new convention could come into effect with the approval of six countries and the conference passed it.

[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] A spokesperson for the French Foreign Office announced that the French delegation attending the Danube River Conference would no longer participate in voting with immediate effect, and France might submit the entire matter to the United Nations.

### U.S. Army Chief of Staff Prepares to Visit Japan, Philippines, and Korea; U.S. Paratroopers Hold Exercises in Hokkaido, Japan

Once he believes that the world situation allows him to depart, he will set off. He has not yet decided on the date of his departure. He will at least go to Japan, the Philippines, and Korea. It is reported that he had planned to depart in the near future, but since the situation in Europe has become tense, he has decided not to depart until the situation improves. Authorities stated that although he can maintain contact with Washington via telegraph and return to Washington within two days in the event of an emergency, he still believes that staying in Washington and remaining at his post is the best option.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th] U.S. military authorities announced on the 17th that U.S. paratroopers are studying "tactical operations" of parachuting onto Japanese northern islands within sight of the Soviet-occupied territories. U.S. military authorities stated that the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment of the 11th Airborne Division is conducting a series of paratrooper jumping exercises in Hokkaido. It is said that the purpose of this is to make paratrooper training realistic and to familiarize personnel with the "tactical operations" of paratroopers. Major Mausude, a training officer with the regiment, said that since April, there have been two to five teams of paratroopers jumping each month, with each team ranging from five to fifty people, depending on the distance and method of the exercise. Hokkaido is only a narrow strait away from the Soviet-occupied Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands.

### Reports on Spy Case Under Study by U.S. State Department; Reply to Soviet Protest Forthcoming

[United States Information Service, Washington, 16th] Regarding the case of Mrs. Kasenkina jumping from the fourth floor of the Soviet Consulate in New York City on August 12th, State Department officials are studying the reports received from the New York Police Department today. According to State Department spokesman McDermott, the notes sent by Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin and Foreign Minister Molotov regarding this case will be answered after detailed study. McDermott said that the State Department is in contact with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and it is expected that the Bureau's investigators will soon send a report.

### Hiss and Chambers Scheduled to Confront Each Other Tomorrow

Announced by U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] The House Un-American Activities Committee's plan to bring Hiss and Time magazine editor Chambers together has been postponed until the 19th.

### New York Soviet Consul General Issues Written Statement

Claims Mrs. Kasenkina's Jump Was Due to U.S. Persecution

[Central News Agency, New York, 16th, Associated Press] Soviet Consul General in New York Lomakin recently stated that Mrs. Kasenkina attempted to commit suicide by jumping to avoid persecution by the U.S. It is said that everything Gao suffered at the hands of anti-communist White Russian "kidnappers," as well as "the defamatory and malicious rumors made by American newspapers and broadcasts, and the threats from American police and courts," greatly disturbed her morale. Lomakin's words are vastly different from what Mrs. Gao told the police, that she was imprisoned in the consulate, so she broke the window and jumped out to avoid being forcibly sent back to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the Moscow Pravda's statement that Mrs. Gao accidentally fell out of the window does not match Lomakin's words. Lomakin issued a mimeographed statement at a reception for reporters at the Soviet Consulate, answering written questions from reporters. The statement did not directly address these questions, but only listed the Soviet Consul's own explanation.

### U.S. Orders Arrest of "Tokyo Rose"

Mrs. D'Aquino to Be Escorted to the U.S. for Trial

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The U.S. Department of Justice has ordered the arrest of "Tokyo Rose" Mrs. D'Aquino on charges of treason. She was born in the United States and currently resides in Tokyo, and is constantly requesting the State Department to issue her a passport so she can return to the United States. D'Aquino is one of the six "Tokyo Roses" who broadcast to American troops, so the War Department has not yet filed charges against her. Although she is married to a Portuguese man, she still retains American citizenship. The Department of Justice has asked the Army to arrest her as soon as possible, escort her back to the United States, and have the grand jury in San Francisco investigate her. The Department of Justice pointed out that Mrs. D'Aquino is the only American among the six, so she can be tried for treason. If found guilty, her maximum punishment will be death, but there must be two witnesses to testify.

### Stalin and Tito's Struggle (Part 1)

— Translated by the Newspaper Compilation Office (Original article published in the July 9th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine)

Tito's defiance of the Kremlin exposed the real weaknesses of the Soviet system. The world's perception of Moscow ruling a "united empire" was shattered. The friction between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia was superficial and obvious; the friction between the Soviet Union and other satellite states was latent, and could surface at any time. The US dollars and supplies needed by communist countries could not be provided by the Soviet Union. This may be an unbearable blow to the unity of the Soviet bloc.

(1) Loosening of the Eastern European Bloc

The nascent communist empire began to show cracks. Affected was Yugoslavia, located on the southwestern edge of the communist empire, where a dispute arose between communist leaders in Moscow and communist leaders in Belgrade. Among the heads of communist countries outside the Soviet Union who dared to defy the Kremlin, Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito was the first. He gradually declared his independence from the Kremlin, because among the eight communist countries, only his was neither bordering the Soviet Union, nor occupied by Soviet troops, except for Albania.

Tito rose to prominence through his own efforts during World War II, and has always tightly controlled the Yugoslav army, secret police, and communist party apparatus. Other Eastern European communist countries were led by people appointed by Moscow, mostly gaining power with the help of the Soviet army. They still follow Moscow's instructions, just like the communist parties in France and Italy. However, some countries have gradually become more resistant.

What happened in Yugoslavia is not only of great importance in the territory of the nascent communist empire, but also of vital importance to the United States and other Western countries. The common view that the Eastern European bloc controlled by the Soviet Union is tightly united has been shattered, and another view has emerged, believing that other hidden weaknesses, coupled with Western pressure and US dollars, may break this bloc apart again.

Economic panic is raging throughout Eastern Europe, prompting the Soviet satellite states to consider compromise with Western countries. Industrialization plans are progressing slowly, and the Soviet Union is urgently focused on its own construction, and has no surplus capacity to supply a large amount of machinery. This machinery can be obtained from the West, but Eastern European countries cannot export enough to buy it.

The communist countries, excluded from the Marshall Plan, desperately need US dollars. In order to release the US$50 million worth of Yugoslav gold confiscated by the United States, Marshal Tito was forced to accept the demands made by the US side on Yugoslavia. Other Eastern European countries may soon have to make concessions to the United States for the needs of trade and loans.

Internal resistance in Eastern Europe is gradually softening the "cold war" of the Soviet alliance. One example is that Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito, ignoring Soviet pressure, was unwilling to force Yugoslav farmers to immediately implement a collective farm system. Tito was deeply concerned that the passive resistance of farmers would endanger the food supply. In other Eastern European countries, nationalization plans for small industries and retail businesses have also been shelved for the same reason.

Communist governments are in no danger of being overthrown, because the police, army, trade unions and government agencies are all in their hands. However, communist party members everywhere still only account for a minority. If the Western countries open fire, the satellite armies are of little value. The governments of Eastern European countries are obsequious to Moscow, but cannot win the hearts of the people. On the contrary, Tito's resistance to Moscow has increased his prestige at home. In countries with a long history of anti-Soviet sentiment, such as Poland, Hungary and Romania, underground anti-Moscow sentiment is particularly strong.

### Loud Cannon Sounds Near Zhenru: Armory Explodes, Destroying Houses and Injuring Eight; Mishandling During Transportation Leads to Grenade Falling and Causing Disaster

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the No. 1 branch of the No. 5 Armory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters near Zhenru in this city, due to mishandling of ammunition, caused an explosion. From 9:50 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., a total of eight people were injured or killed, and more than ten houses were destroyed. Fortunately, the location was remote, and the loss was minimal. In addition to strengthening security and conducting cleanup operations, the authorities have also begun investigating the detailed truth.

The armory is located in Quanzhili, Shenjiajiao, north of Jiaotong Road, about six or seven li from Zhenru. There was a motor vehicle room in the armory, which originally piled up more than 30 tons of abandoned ammunition left by the former Japanese army, including shells, heavy grenades, and hand grenades. Recently, because the armory needed to be repaired and reorganized, the officer in charge, Ou Changsen, a lieutenant, along with squad leader Chen Peng and soldiers Wu Qing, Li Xidi, and Fu Xian, a total of five people, have been moving the ammunition out since the 16th. Yesterday, they continued to work, and at around 9:50 a.m., suddenly, due to mishandling during transportation, a hand grenade fell to the ground. The batch of ammunition had been stored for too long, making it extremely dangerous, so it immediately exploded on the spot. Sparks splattered, extending to other shells. With a loud bang, a major disaster occurred. Ou Yang and the other five people were unable to escape and all died in the line of duty. At that time, shrapnel flew in all directions, with extreme ferocity. Zhang Guozhi, a guard from the 5th squad of the armory guard team, a soldier from a security company, and three nearby residents, Zhao Sanmao and others, were also injured, but their injuries were minor.

Officials Inspect and Strengthen Security

At the time of the accident, the director of the branch armory, Xiong Baozong, had just gone to the Jiangwan general armory to meet with armory director Xu Wenda. After hearing the news, he immediately rushed back. Fire brigades from various districts also rushed to the scene to bravely put out the fire, but because shrapnel was flying everywhere, rescue was difficult. It was not until 4:00 p.m. that the remaining embers were extinguished. During the explosion, Chen Qian, director of the Joint Logistics Shanghai Supply Bureau, Shi Zhensheng, deputy director, Commander Zhou of the port command, and Yan Zi, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Garrison Command, all arrived at the scene to inspect and strengthen security. Personnel from the Zhenru District Police Bureau were also fully mobilized.

Entire Family of Villagers Affected

According to a post-accident investigation of losses: in addition to the complete destruction of the motor vehicle room in the armory, Building No. 52 of the barracks was also affected, with most of it collapsing. Among the nearby civilian houses that were burned and collapsed, there were a total of five houses belonging to families such as Sun Afu. In addition, a resident, Sun Guigen, because his son was about to get married in October, had recently purchased a large number of furniture, pigs, sheep, etc. This time, they bore the brunt of the disaster, and their entire family was wiped out, resulting in the greatest loss. According to current rough estimates, the ammunition destroyed included more than 20,000 hand grenades, more than 20,000 flares, and about 90 shells. According to authorities, in addition to investigating responsibility for the explosion in accordance with the law, they will also strengthen the inspection and security of other armories to ensure safety. Compensation should be provided to the injured and killed soldiers and civilians, and because the weather is hot, in order to prevent danger from the explosion site, firefighting and security will be conducted simultaneously, and cleanup operations must wait two or three days before they can proceed.

Two People Suspected

Central News Agency Report: According to sources responsible for investigating the cause of the accident, before the explosion of the armory, an unemployed soldier who was lodging in the armory suddenly left, which seemed suspicious, and an investigation is underway.

Another report: At 11:00 a.m. on the day before the explosion (the 16th), a young man was found within the 500-meter security line of the branch armory, wandering for a very long time, seemingly with some intent. He was apprehended by the armory guards. He claimed to be Li Chunxiang, 17 years old, from Yancheng, northern Jiangsu, living in Zhujiawan West, Xiaoxinzhuang, Zhenru Binbei, but did not reveal the reason for wandering. The suspicion factor is very significant.

### Shanghai-Made Glass Silk Stockings: Daily Production of 40 Dozen; Social Affairs Bureau Sends Personnel to Investigate; Disposal Method Undecided

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the ban on the sale of imported nylon stockings, Yue Gu Bo Sock Factory, located at No. 3 Caojiazhai, Jiangsu Road in this city, previously submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting permission to sell the domestically produced nylon stockings produced by the factory. Gu Bingyuan, director of the First Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Chude, section chief, went to the factory yesterday morning to conduct an on-site inspection. According to the investigation, the factory owner, Yue Gu Bo, is an Iraqi who registered with the former Ministry of Economic Affairs last year and obtained factory registration certificate No. 12160. The raw materials used by the factory to manufacture glass silk stockings are waste materials purchased from the United States. The Import and Export Management Committee applied for foreign exchange, and the customs also permitted the export of these products. Currently, it produces about 40 dozen pairs of men's glass silk stockings per day. The products are printed with the English words "Made in China" and are sold in Southeast Asia. The factory currently has more than 200 workers, with a base salary of 2.1 yuan per dozen pairs, plus 4 jiao as a severance fee. The workers are all members of the Third District Knitting Industry Trade Union. Once the sales are banned, the workers will inevitably lose their jobs.

He will inquire with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Import and Export Management Committee, and the Customs about Yue Gu Bo Sock Factory's registration and export situation, before deciding on a handling method.

The District Court opened a trial in the Fourth Criminal Court yesterday, presided over by Judge Wu Shaochang, summoning the defendants Yuan Baoying and Huang Yingbang, the respondents Zhou Wenyuan and Guo Wenyu, and the witnesses Su Zonghua, Han Fen, and Weisibuluke to testify. The defendant Yuan Baoying first confessed: Yan Pei was crazy and could not manage affairs at home. The workers in the factory were causing trouble, and he could not solve it, so he was sent to the hospital for treatment. The court asked: Is it okay to send your own husband to the hospital? Did you want his property? Yuan confessed: All the property is in Yan's name, I have no bad intentions. His sister is also crazy, I always hope the man is well. The court asked: If you hope the man is well, should you lock him in a mental hospital? Yuan was speechless. The defendant Huang Yingbang confessed: He has been serving in the hospital for eleven years. At 5:00 p.m. that afternoon, Yan's family brought a letter of introduction from the Health Bureau and sent him to the hospital. He was restless and excited in the ward, so he was given a diagnosis. His body temperature was 37.5 degrees Celsius and his pulse was 126. After 8:00 p.m., he still refused to sleep and was eager to break out of the door and shouted: "I am the Heavenly King, and I will invite Truman to a meeting at the International Hotel tonight."

### College Student's Marriage Repudiation Case Opens: The Woman Denies Writing a Letter of Repentance

[Report from this newspaper] The marriage repudiation case of Feng Ji, a student at Great China University, was heard by Judge Mailer of the District Court in the Eighth Criminal Court yesterday. The defendant did not appear, and the plaintiff Peng Zhixing and his daughter Chujiao appeared in court to testify. The reason is that Peng's daughter and her fiancé Feng Ji had clandestine meetings in the Zhongnan, Dah沪, and Da Shanghai hotels in this city three times from November of last year to January 25 of this year, and are now seven months pregnant. Feng refused to marry because his fiancée had had relationships with Zhu Yao and Zheng Deyu before the engagement, losing her virginity twice. On April 21 of this year, Peng's daughter wrote a letter of repentance. Afterwards, Feng avoided seeing her, intending to repudiate the marriage. Peng's father learned about this, reported it to the police, and had Feng detained and sent to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution on suspicion of disrupting the family. Peng's daughter appeared in court yesterday, heavily pregnant, with no sign of embarrassment.

### Large-Scale Dismissals After Physical Examinations; Texaco's Actions Deemed Improper; Labor Union Rightfully Fighting for Employees

The American-owned Texaco Oil Company recently ordered physical examinations for its employees at Cuihang.

Among them, some had suffered from lung disease in the past but had now recovered, and the company believed that there was a possibility of recurrence in the future; some had slightly high blood pressure; and one was even dismissed for having athlete's foot. All the employees were outraged upon hearing the news, believing that their jobs were not secure and that the company's actions were clearly inappropriate. The company's industrial union rightfully fought for the employees. After negotiations, the company realized that it was in the wrong and agreed to reinstate four of them, but has not accepted the reinstatement of the remaining seventeen. The union has reported the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau for filing and is still fighting for the employees. In addition, 120 employees at the company's Fuxing Island warehouse recently received orders to undergo physical examinations. Because they believed that the company was using this as an excuse for dismissal, they all refused to be examined as a protest.

### City Government to Be Responsible for Applying for Loans; Public Utilities Agree to Reduce New Prices; Public Buses and Ferries to Reduce Prices Starting Today

[Our Newspaper News] The issue of price reductions for public utilities in the city was resolved satisfactorily yesterday. All public utilities have decided to reduce the new prices for this month in accordance with the resolution of the City Council. However, the portion of the losses due to the price reduction will be the responsibility of the city government and the City Council, which will apply for loans from the Central Bank. The reduced new prices will be implemented from the date of meter reading, and refunds will be given for payments already made.

The prices of public buses and city ferries operated by the City Public Utilities Bureau will be reduced starting today. The new prices are: City public buses, 100,000 to 280,000 yuan (original price 140,000 to 350,000 yuan). City ferries, across the river ferry, 100,000 yuan (original price 120,000 yuan). Wudao ferry, 68,000 yuan (original price 85,000 yuan). Monthly passes will remain unchanged in price in accordance with Article 9 of the Monthly Pass Regulations.

Trolley Prices to Be Reduced in Two or Three Days

The prices of British and French trolley tickets will be reduced in two or three days because new tickets need to be reprinted. It was found that the City Council's resolution on price reduction stipulates that the 50% increase in the calculation of adjusted prices based on the July cost of living index, metal index, and foreign exchange rate will be cancelled. After this price reduction, the prices of public utilities can be reduced by about 70% to 80% compared to the previously determined prices.

Resolved After Two Consultations

After the major public utilities announced shocking price increases this month, the City Council convened an emergency meeting to take into account the burden on citizens and unanimously resolved to ask them to reduce prices. However, the companies' attitude was firm and they refused. Mayor Wu specially convened a meeting with the persons in charge of the companies the day before yesterday and suggested four solutions to persuade them to reconsider, and they responded yesterday. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu again convened a meeting with the City Council, the Public Utilities Bureau, and representatives of the companies. The companies still insisted that they would not reduce prices unless the government subsidized them or there were other solutions to their economic problems. After the city government and the City Council were responsible for guaranteeing the loan, it was finally resolved. However, no deadline has been set for the repayment of the loan, which has almost become a disguised subsidy.

Investigation Committee to Be Established Today

In addition, the Public Utilities Open System Investigation and Review Committee is scheduled to be established today to discuss and review the procedures first. In addition to the five members already nominated by the City Council, namely Jiang Hao, Li Wenjie, Qu Yue, Jiang Haoran, and Shao Yongsheng, one representative each will be assigned by the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the City Industrial Association, the Society of Engineers, the Society of Electrical Engineers, the Certified Public Accountants Association, the City Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau to serve as members.

### Vivid Qinhuangdao

—Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Han Qingtao

[Airmail from Qinhuangdao, this newspaper, 14th] The KMA built the pier of Qinhuangdao, so the seaside of Qinhuangdao became the world of KMA. KMA is the English abbreviation of Kailuan Mining Administration, and also their logo.

Walking to the seaside area of ​​Qinhuangdao Railway South, there is "Kailuan Road" leading directly to the pier. Next to the flat cement road, there grow clean, green high locust trees and short elm trees. There is also a red cylinder brick road printed with KMA, which adjoins and runs parallel to it.

To the east is the Kailuan Railway. Most of the locomotives on the railway are marked with KMA. There are also electric trams and cars of various sizes with the letters KMA running on the railway and roads. Here, you can also see many Kailuan employees wearing KMA cap badges, active and working.

Walking to the East Mountain, if you look northeast, there is an extremely large coal storage yard, which can store 500,000 to 600,000 tons of coal. Coal from Gu Ye and Tangshan is sent here, and then transported to the south and abroad.

Kailuan's World. At the foot of the East Mountain, there is the Kailuan Hydroelectric Power Plant, which supplies electricity and water to the Kailuan pier, factories, offices, and the residential areas of all Kailuan and Yaohua employees in the south of the railway. Every street and important open space has water taps that residents can open and use at will. North of the Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Kailuan Railway runs vertically and horizontally. Locomotives, freight cars, and electric trams are all parked here. The Kailuan repair factory, in that area with the large yellow letters KMA painted on it and surrounded by walls, emits smoke and steam, and the sound of hammering can be heard.

Land-Sea Connection Station. The Qinhuangdao Customs Wharf is at the southern foot of the East Mountain. There are two large and small, like two legs extending into the sea. The large pier is on the outside. It is a semi-circular steel-concrete embankment. The back of this bow-like pier acts as a breakwater, and the inside of the bowstring is the ship berthing area. The small pier is on the right side of the large pier, inside the harbor, and is a short dike.

The large and small piers together are about 2,700 feet long. The depth of the port ranges from 21 feet to 31 feet. Ships with a draft of 30 feet or less can berth. The large pier can berth five ships, and the small pier can berth two ships. The pier is paved with railway tracks. Trains come and go, loading and unloading goods. Goods from ships at sea are sent by Kailuan locomotives to the Beining Road crossing and pulled onto Beining Road. Goods arriving by train are pulled by Kailuan trucks to the pier at the crossing. The land-sea connection is extremely convenient.

The pier is equipped with tap water pipes to supply fresh water to berthed ships. There is also a cargo warehouse nearby with a capacity of 15,000 tons. The harbor has two dredgers, emitting smoke and the sound of motors, constantly dredging the harbor.

The temperature here, although often below zero in winter, and the sea surface freezes in January and February, does not greatly hinder the navigation and berthing of ships. When the ice is very thick, icebreakers can remove the obstacles caused by the severe cold, so Qinhuangdao has become the non-freezing port of the north.

Today, Qinhuangdao has become a connecting point for north-south land and sea transportation, a water supply line for North China, a support station for the Northeast, and a base for the navy to go north and south. This pier, privately owned by Kailuan, is exerting its great power for the public and for itself.

North-South Two Areas. Beining Road divides Qinhuangdao into two areas, north and south of the railway. The north of the railway is the old city area. West Front Street, West Back Street, Haiyang Road, and the two north-south cross-roads are the concentrated areas of various types of shops. At the same time, these two cross-roads are also the main lines that run through and connect the north and south areas of the railway.

The various goods sold in the large and small stores all come from Tianjin. In addition to stationery and elementary school textbooks, a few bookstores only have five or six kinds of film and drama pictorials published by Tianjin. Other publications from Beijing and Shanghai are not available. The three large and small cinemas show films that have been shown in Beijing and Tianjin for a long time.

"Kailuan," "Yaohua," "Beining Road," and "Hebei Power Branch," etc., have prospered Qinhuangdao. Most of the people directly or indirectly make a living under these two signs. Except for a few special people, it can be said that they depend on each other to survive on this land.

The secluded and beautiful East Mountain has a special charm. The fresh seaside has beautiful scenery. As the sun sets, the men and women watching the tide, the young people bathing in the sea, the little treasures active on the beach, and the old men who come to cool off, all receive considerable satisfaction from nature.

### Hotel Guest in Ningbo Commits Heinous Crime; Swindles Money and Takes a Life

Shop Assistant of Fang Jiuxia Jewelry Store, Wang Cailie, Dies Tragically from Stabbing

[Report from Ningbo, 17th of this paper] In a city filled with excitement and bustle, violent robberies and murders continue. This morning, a horrifying incident occurred as a traveler swindled money and took a life. A refined young man arrived at the Hongxing Hotel on Binjiang Road in the morning and booked room No. 6 on the third floor. He soon went out to Fang Jiuxia Jewelry Store to buy gold ornaments, where he was served by Wang Cailie. He selected three gold rings weighing a total of one tael and one qian, and the agreed purchase price was over 640 million yuan. The traveler claimed not to have cash and asked the store to send someone with him to Kaiyuanzhuang on the Jiangbei bank to pay. Wang Cailie accompanied him, only to be tricked to the Hongxing Hotel. Around 11:00 a.m., the guest suddenly changed clothes and went downstairs. His behavior was normal. At lunchtime, the waiter became suspicious when he saw two guests enter but only one leave. He rushed upstairs to check and saw a person lying in a pool of blood with fresh blood all over his body. The store owner quickly reported the incident to the police. The body of the deceased was found with over thirty stab wounds, making it unidentifiable. The manager of Fang Jiuxia Jewelry Store, concerned about Wang's long absence, also heard about the bloodshed on Binjiang Road and went to identify the body. It turned out to be his store employee. He immediately wired the district attorney's office to send personnel to examine the body and notify the family for funeral arrangements.

### Shen Bao Cooperates with Tsinghua Hospital, Renhe Hospital, Baoli Hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Shangxian Maternity and Children's Hospital, and Hui Sheng Obstetrics Hospital; Jinji Car Factory Statement; Truth About the Gaps in the Highway

In a letter from reader Zhang Baling in your column on August 10, it was stated that because our factory connected to a tap water pipe, it caused the highway to sink into two large gaps. Upon investigation, our factory only installed one tap water pipe, so there is only one gap, and this project was contracted by the Inland Tap Water Company, so it is not our factory's responsibility. The letter also stated that the Shanghai-Minhang South Extension Long-Distance Bus Company sent workmen to fill the gaps with soil, which was prevented by our factory. The highway is not our factory's property, so how could we prevent it? Furthermore, our factory has also sent apprentices to repair the gaps. Recently, the authority responsible for installing the tap water pipe has sent many workers to fill it again to prevent it from sinking further in the future. It can be seen that Mr. Zhang is not clear about the truth of the matter, so we specially request that this letter be published. Shanghai Jinji Car Factory

### Silver Market Loosens, Sentiment Firms Up, Chinese Stocks Surge at Close, Eleven Stocks Including Yongsha and Qinxing Rise to Limit

Although Chinese stocks rose yesterday, high prices were difficult to sustain. Silver credit has already eased slightly, but measures such as stopping loans to the industrial and commercial sectors and tightening issuance, though far from reality, still cause concern in the fragile stock market. Near the close, off-market stimulation intensified, and rumors spread of large fund injections from the National Bank of China, causing eleven stocks, including Qinxing, to rise to the limit. Yongsha even required a slight premium, creating an ambiguous situation. This was partly encouraged by next-day settlement, making it difficult to confirm the trend.

The morning started firm, with Yongsha opening high at 16,600 yuan, and other stocks also showing gains. After the opening, high-priced transactions by numbers 148, 206, 76, 12, 207, 30, 89, 137, and 218 were frequently settled, gradually trending downward. At noon, it fell as low as 15,950 yuan. After replenishing gains from numbers 69, 190, and 206, the noon closing was 16,050 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, Yong Yong Industry rose to the limit, Sino-French Domestic Underwear was flat, Xingguang, Jingfu, Xinhua, and Li'an experienced slight declines. Yonggong, Zhongni, and Sisheng rose by half a percent, while Zhabei, Xinyi, and Zhongsheng fell by half a percent; the rest experienced slight gains.

In the afternoon market, Yongsha immediately saw 16,700 yuan, but this was still an illusion. Starting from 16,720 yuan, numbers 114, 218, 137, and 160 were sold off, falling to 16,580 yuan. Qinxing reached the limit due to stock swaps and changes in unit relationships. Other stocks only turned bullish after 3 PM. Rongfeng Underwear, Huafeng, Jinglun, Yonggong, Commerce, Zhabei, Hengfeng, and Zhongxing successively rose to the limit. Yongsha was absorbed by numbers 190, 65, 145, and 155, etc. After reaching the limit, there was a slight addition of water. Off-market stimulation intensified, and rumors of large fund injections by the National Bank of China resurfaced, but the National Bank of China was actually injecting funds. After the close, Yongsha reached the limit with sellers. Compared to the morning closing, Yongsha, Qinxing, Rongfeng Underwear, Yonggong, Huafeng, Commerce, Zhabei, and Hengfeng rose to the limit, while other stocks rose by half a percent to one percent. Over-the-counter, unlisted stocks were all bullish, especially Shijie, Zhongguo, Dasheng, and Guanshengyuan, which saw the most dramatic gains.

Government bonds advanced to new highs yesterday due to easing credit. New buyers were eager, and Unified C opened at 210,000, reaching a new high of 238,000. Near noon, it struggled around 230,000. Although rooms 552, 503, 360, and 350 came to sell, it still closed at 228,000. As a result, Unified A, B, C, and E each rose by about 10%, and Unified D also improved by half a percent. Turnover was approximately 5 million.

According to the Export Control Commission: In order to promote the export of Chinese tea, the government has decided to provide export tea loans, with the loan amount set at 10 million per dan. Subsequently, due to rising domestic prices and increased procurement costs, a loan of 10 million per dan was not enough for tea merchants to operate. Export tea merchants unanimously requested that the loan per dan be increased to 80 million in national currency. This request has now been resolved by the National Bank of China's Discount and Loan Committee and the Advisory Committee to lend 70% of the requested amount, that is, the export tea loan is increased to 56 million in national currency per dan.

Also, it is reported: The foreign tea market opened in the morning and was still in a consolidation phase, but later the trend turned slightly better, and the market rebounded again.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation: due to a large number of remittances from other locations to Shanghai in the afternoon of the previous day, and even more so because of a large surplus of funds from banking institutions, silver credit tended to loosen. New buying suddenly became active, and traders in out-of-town trading took advantage of the low prices to aggressively enter the market. It was heard that traders in the north were collecting large quantities of goods from off-market, so the opening bid for 12-pound Longzhu fine cloth reached 90 million, without a buyer. Then, a formal transaction was made only after it rose by 10.7 million compared to the afternoon closing of the previous day. Although the market was buoyant, the silver credit within the industry was still tight. There was a lot of floating profit up for sale, and at around 9:50, it retreated slightly by 3.5 million.

After 10:00, because many companies were selling Longzhu at the 80 million level, those who were short covering became active, and traders also came to compete for absorption, the market gradually rose, reaching a high of 91 million, and returned near to 88.2 million, which was a rebound of 11.4 million compared to the previous day.

### After the Implementation of the Measures for Overseas Chinese Investment, Overseas Remittances in Guangdong and Fujian are Expected to Increase

[Our newspaper reported] The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee of the Industrial Association had a consultation with Director Huo of the Import and Export Control Commission on the issue of re-production after overseas Chinese capital is imported in the form of raw materials. It is understood that the views of all parties on the issue of how easy it is for raw material imports to become funds are not consistent. The government is deeply concerned about whether this fund will flow into the black market to stimulate the exchange market; what manufacturers are concerned about is how to use this fund to purchase raw materials and participate in re-production. It is heard that the competent authorities will first ask their superiors for instructions for the sake of caution, and then make a decision.

Xu Fengzao, Director of the Xiamen District Office of the Import and Export Management Committee, came to Shanghai a few days ago on official business. According to reports: Xiamen is a concentrated area for overseas remittances. In the past, due to the excessive difference between the exchange rate and the black market, they were all avoided. After the implementation of the exchange settlement certificate method, it still failed to catch up with the black market, and overseas remittances were not enthusiastic. Recently, overseas Chinese are allowed to return to China to invest in production enterprises, and overseas Chinese can bring in goods. Overseas remittances can definitely increase sharply. This office has submitted and approved the permission for overseas Chinese to bring in goods, but the method is simple and the scope is not extensive, and the results are not satisfactory. The measures announced this time are more complete than in the past, and it is believed that overseas remittances will no longer be avoided. In the past, the most permitted imports were from Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and other places. The main materials were rubber, coconut oil, and tropical medicines. In addition, the import quota in this area for the fifth and sixth seasons was a total of more than 160,000 US dollars, while the actual need was more than 300,000 US dollars, a difference of half. The new measures for overseas Chinese investment can make up for it.

### The Passing of American Baseball Legend Babe Ruth from Cancer After Two Years

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, United Press, New York, 16th] Babe "Babe" Ruth, the American baseball legend, passed away today after battling cancer for over two years. His condition took a sudden turn for the worse. Ruth's condition appeared to improve last weekend, and he was even able to get out of bed. However, the sudden decline was unexpected. At 5:00 PM, Memorial Hospital issued an emergency bulletin stating that Ruth's condition was critical. He passed away at 6:25 PM, with his wife, two daughters, and several friends by his side. Ruth had been in a semi-comatose state before 6:25 PM. His personal physician, Dr. Haisai Martin, was also present but unable to save the baseball legend.

A Brief Biography of Babe Ruth

Babe Ruth passed away at the age of 53, born on February 7, 1894. He was extremely poor in his childhood and even stole bananas from vendors to satisfy his hunger. However, he eventually displayed his talent in baseball, becoming famous as the "Home Run King." He earned a substantial salary of $80,000 a year with the New York Yankees. During his 22 years in the Baseball League, he hit a total of 714 home runs. In 1927, he set a record of 60 home runs in a single season, which remains unbroken to this day. Ruth played for the Red Sox for six years. In 1920, at the age of 26, Ruth's athletic talent was recognized by Colonel Rupert, a liquor magnate, and he began playing for the New York Yankees, eventually becoming a nationally renowned sports figure. At that time, the Yankees were struggling and did not have their own stadium. Rupert, knowing Ruth's immense drawing power, invested $2 million to build Yankee Stadium, the greatest sports palace in America, which was completed in 1923, and it can be said that it was created because of Babe Ruth. This Yankee stadium can accommodate 70,000 spectators, and the American Baseball League, the World Baseball Finals, etc., are all held here. What makes people never forget is the 1932 World Baseball Finals, in Chicago against the Cubs. Ruth took the field and loudly proclaimed that he would hit a home run this time. As the ball came, he swung and hit it squarely, sending it flying towards center field. His accuracy was truly astonishing. After retiring, Ruth's last appearance at the stadium was in 1947, when the National Baseball Field celebrated "Babe Ruth Day." Ruth made his final performance at Yankee Stadium. Ruth's first wife, Helen Woodford, was a waitress at the Landt Cafe in Boston. She met Ruth at the age of 16 when Babe was joining the Red Sox. It was love at first sight, and Helen secretly gave Ruth larger cakes than she gave to other customers to satisfy his hunger. They married in October 1914, but this couple, who had shared hardships, unfortunately divorced after twelve years.

The crowds heading to Wembley Stadium today did not diminish due to the heat. According to statistics, no less than 100,000 people entered and exited the venue. As for the residents of London, those who had already seen the World Games flocked to the English countryside for vacation, so today, from early morning, 200,000 Londoners went to various train stations to catch trains, making it impossible for the general police officers and station staff to perform their duties. Similarly, the roads were also filled with various vehicles. Such a grand occasion can indeed be called unprecedented in post-war London. Tomorrow is Sunday, and the conference will take a day off, but the busy situation at the various fire stations is expected not to be relaxed in the slightest, because a new batch of spectators will rush from the European continent to compete to see the track and field and ball games finals. This will undoubtedly allow the British treasury to receive another huge amount of foreign exchange.

At the track and field stadium in Wembley, the javelin and high jump preliminaries were held this morning. In the afternoon, there were the 50,000-meter race walk, the women's 100-meter preliminaries, the 400-meter hurdles finals, and the highly anticipated men's 100-meter semi-finals and finals. The men's 100-meter semi-finals began at 2:30 PM. In the first group, American black athletes Dillard and Ewell finished first and second with 10.4 seconds each. British McGoggart finished third with 10.7 seconds. In the second group, American Baden finished first with 10.4 seconds, and Panama's Raby (black) finished second with 10.5 seconds. The third place was also a British athlete, also named Mack (Donald). The fact that Britain had two 100-meter athletes who could participate in the finals was unprecedented in previous World Games. So this news almost drove Londoners crazy, and the names of the two Macks were printed in extra-large lead letters in the evening newspapers that day. The 100-meter finals were held at 3:45 PM. All the spectators in the stands waited with bated breath, hoping for a world record to be broken. As soon as the gun fired, twelve flying legs dashed out in unison. As a result, the champion was still American black athlete Dillard, who tied the Olympic record with 10.3 seconds. He was only 0.1 seconds away from the world record of 10.2 seconds. American black athlete Ewell finished second with 10.4 seconds. Third was Panama's Raby. Fourth was British McGoggart. American Baden and British MacDonald were ranked fifth and sixth respectively. From this, it can be seen that the sprinting ability of black people far exceeds that of white people. America's Coach Lun broke the World Games record in the 400-meter hurdles with 51.1 seconds and won the championship, but it was still far from the world record of 50.6 seconds. There were also wonderful diving performances and the men's 100-meter freestyle finals in the Royal Swimming Pool today. As a result, America's Lees won the championship with 57.3 seconds, setting a new Olympic record, but it was still incomparable to the world record of 55.4 seconds. Second was England's Ford, and third was Hungary. All the results today were not as satisfactory as expected. This may be due to the influence of the weather, but the amazing new records that were hyped up in the newspapers may just be a coincidence.

### Firefly

— Bai Yong

It's the middle of the lunar month, and the Heavenly River coupling season has passed its peak of prosperity. One can't help but think of Du Sichen's famous line: "The night on the Heavenly Street is as cool as water, I lie and watch the Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars." Although the night is not yet cool, the lingering summer heat is still intense.

Regarding fireflies, I always feel like they are a good subject for a short essay, but unfortunately, I can't think of much else to say. Besides the previous verses, there are still remnants of childhood memories of reciting the "Dongshan" chapter from the Book of Songs in the village: "In the fields and hunting grounds, the fireflies crawl shining. They are not to be feared, but to be cherished." At first, I was just shouting loudly, and it wasn't until I went to middle school that I realized that "xiaoxing" refers to fireflies. Although my home is located near a river, it is not what is called "low-lying, damp land," so "rotten grass," etc., doesn't really "transform into fireflies." Therefore, my childhood impression of fireflies is almost non-existent.

Later, I lived in Beiping, where there were spacious courtyards and old houses. Even "large communal courtyards" had large open spaces for people to enjoy the cool air and watch the stars and moon at night, unlike Nanjing and Shanghai, where people are forced onto the streets or into alleys by courtyards as small as bean curd. In the past, electricity was not very common in Beijing. Underneath small sour jujube trees or crabapple trees, with fragrant jasmine and tuberose placed at night, one would always see that small cluster of faint green light. Children, not knowing any better, sometimes even felt a slight fear, but eventually, it turned into joy, chasing after it and collecting it in small glass bottles to compare the size of the light. Often, at these moments, the little bug's light would automatically go out, causing the children to sigh unhappily.

It is this little bit of light that has won the love of people and even all things. Although fireflies are small, they are indeed great. The Dragon Tree Bodhisattva in the "Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra" says:

"For example, a firefly can shine a little in the absence of the sun. But when the sun rises, with its thousand rays of light, the moon and all the stars have no light. How much less a firefly!"

Although many people with dull roots cannot understand Buddhist words, this saying is very enlightening. Most people in the world slander the ordinary, thinking that they cannot startle the common people. They don't know that a bowl of porridge and a meal, a thread and a strand, all come from the ordinary. Their greatness cannot be measured compared to heroes fighting and killing thousands. Moreover, this is a spark in the boundless darkness. Ancient legends say that Che Wuzi used it to read books, which is naturally a far-fetched and unbelievable story (Fabre's Book of Insects says: "If you move a firefly over a line of text, you can see individual letters, or even the whole word if it is not too long, in the darkness. But you can't see anything outside this small area. Such light would make the reader lose patience." According to this, studying by firefly light is not easy. If Che Wuzi could do it, he could be called an iron pestle ground into a needle). But you know how anxious one is for a bit of light in the boundless darkness. Zhuangzi's story of drying up the water in the west river to save the fish in the puddles is a joking allegory. If it is compared to waiting for the sun to rise, as said in the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, it really makes people impatient, and it is the same as Che Wuzi's studying by firefly light. The sun shines on all things and has no intention of claiming credit. Fireflies are also like this. We can use them to light our reading, but they can also turn off their lights and ignore us. This meaning is no different from the sun's ability to make the stars and moon dim. So people are the most despicable, measuring everything by utility, and calculating its size, which is truly unbearable.

There is another strange thing that I might as well mention in passing: Fabre discovered that the firefly's food is actually snails that are dozens of times larger than it. It can use an anesthetic to stun the snail and then suck its juices. China originally had the saying of "red birds and white crows," which means fireflies eat mosquitoes, as seen in Xia Xiaozheng, which is nonsense. But unexpectedly, its real food would be even bigger than mosquitoes, which is truly "another oddity." I often say: There is danger in the light. Could it be that fireflies are no exception?

### Two Old Men in the Old Capital

— Zhu An

Recently, there have been two old painters in the old capital who are over eighty years old: Qi Baishi and Huang Binhong. Old Pin (Baishi's style name is Pinsheng, his real name is Huang, meaning taking fields in Weibin. Today, he is indeed old and respected, which has become a premonition.) His residence was purchased with the money he accumulated from selling paintings. He has always been known for his ability to accumulate wealth. It is said that he has more than one property, so his later years are quite good. However, because he is overly cautious, his rooms and boxes are full of locks, which he wears on his body, seeming to reduce his elegance. In fact, he is extremely generous and values ​​friendship. His elegance is in his heart and not in form. Old Bin only lived in Beiping for ten years. During the chaos, he closed his door and did not participate in external affairs, enjoying himself. He is the same as Old Pin, but his spirit seems even stronger. In Old Pin's room, there has never been a single painting or calligraphy hanging, and there is not a single antique on the seat. He has no other hobbies besides painting. Old Bin's room is a small cubicle, so small that it is not enough to turn around, but the books he reads are piled from the ground to the ceiling. The ceiling has collapsed, and he does not mind if the books get wet from the rain. His books are not particular about versions, but there are many specialized and rare ones. He especially likes to collect local literature, research and praise it, sparing no effort. His desk is piled with ancient seals and ancient jade. Although he no longer carves seals himself, he still often has new insights into epigraphy. He likes to write couplets in seal script and give them away casually, without any stinginess. Although there are many people who ask for paintings, every morning he still uses rough paper to copy ancient paintings, entirely for his own enjoyment, without any thought of fame or gain. His material life is extremely simple, but when people from Liulichang bring calligraphy and paintings, as long as they are truly excellent, he does not hesitate to buy them at a high price, which is much higher than the price people pay for his paintings. He uses his spare skills to engage in gardening. On the dusty and eroded bookshelves, you can find the calamus he planted by hand. In the dry and cold climate of the north, this is very difficult to do. Especially next to the low wooden door, there is probably only three feet of space, but he planted a clump of thin bamboo, which truly eliminates the worldly atmosphere. Old Bin has now returned to the south. I wonder who will write about his former residence in Beiping in the sequel to "Old News of Ri Xia."

### After Recovering from Illness, Uncle Fan Gave Up Wine and Now Drinks Again, Two Beautiful Poems, Following the Rhyme

— Shen Yuzhong

Shi Ran is my friend, I love him but dare not be presumptuous, I spend several mornings and evenings in his building, and I am happy when there is wine; it is difficult to see people clearly, but I examine the world with my heart, When the wine is drunk, the poetry is heroic, and the aura is like thunder and lightning. The words are clear like water, and the reasoning is deep and unfathomable. When the poem is finished, the wine is drunk again, and the thoughts are chaotic and the emotions are more painful. Suddenly sick in the summer, lying down and giving up the cup, Is the body sick, or is the heart sick? This taste can be transferred to me. I spend a long day on the pillow, deleting and cutting the manuscripts myself, Pushing the pillow and getting up to find wine, the figure becomes the host and guest, The lamp flame and the wine wave, look at each other at close range.

After recovering from illness, he can drink again, and the lotus in the pool is for you. Looking back at the past, the days passed like falling into a trap; The world is topsy-turvy, and one thought is clear. When I come to hand the cup in the morning, I can go far away from here. I miss Jian Lake, and the crazy state of He Jian! I was also a former drinker, and my courage has decreased with age, The vicissitudes of life suppress my good feelings, and the hair on my temples can verify this. You are a true hero, and refuse to change your indulgence, Salute to the two vertical strokes, and the afternoon dream falls in the village shop. The wine is old, look again, you must make the monsters fear, Using this to dominate the world, will surely stop the sigh of the people.

### An Unlucky Dream

— Qi Feng

One afternoon in 1865, as the members of President Lincoln's cabinet walked into the meeting hall to prepare for a meeting, they found the president sitting at the head of the table, his face buried in his hands. In an instant, he raised his head, his face weary and solemn.

"Gentlemen," the president said, "I have an important message to tell you."

"Do you have some bad news? Or did something serious happen?" Several congressmen asked with concern.

"I haven't heard anything, and there's no news," the president said. "But last night I had a dream that I was in a small boat, all alone, without oars or a rudder, on the boundless sea, without any help."

After a moment of silence, the president continued; "During the war, I had several dreams like that, and every time a major battle happened within one or two days after the dream. Gentlemen, maybe tomorrow, maybe in a few hours, you will get important news."

Five hours later, Lincoln was assassinated.

Is this superstition or fate?

### The Story of the Expert's Position

— Liu Sheng

Everyone knows that the United States is a scientifically developed country. They value science, and you can hear the opinions of experts at any time. Here are some stories about American experts.

Recently, many highway experts in North Dakota were preparing to hold a meeting to review road construction issues. But as a result, most members were unable to attend, so they had to reschedule. The reason why members could not attend the meeting was: the roads were too bad, and after the rain they were all muddy, and cars could not drive.

A young patient came to a hospital in New Jersey. He was only nineteen months old when he swallowed a safety pin, which stuck in his throat. Several specialist doctors at the hospital took an X-ray of him and told his parents that to save the child's life, surgery was necessary - but the surgery was also quite dangerous. Just as the parents were hesitating, the little boy suddenly sneezed, and with a "achoo" sound, the safety pin "sprayed" out.

In Springfield, Ohio, there is a person who drives very cautiously and has never caused an accident or violated traffic rules for many years. In order to commend him, the authorities specially presented him with a medal. Overjoyed, the man invited many friends to a banquet to celebrate. After the banquet, the award-winning gentleman was stopped by a traffic policeman halfway home - his car was driving crookedly, because he was already drunk. "Drunk driving" just happened to violate traffic regulations.

In Salt Lake City, Utah, many construction experts held a meeting to discuss ways to prevent fires. They went on a tour together to see which houses in the city were dangerous. As a result, they found the house with the worst fire prevention equipment - the local central fire station. In a school in Chicago, one day the teachers were teaching first aid methods. Unexpectedly, the teacher suddenly fainted while teaching artificial respiration, and the students immediately used what they had learned to give artificial respiration to their teacher, which finally saved him.

### A Discussion of Meditation Experiences (Part 1)

— Jiang Wenyu

From the end of April in the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946) to the middle of August this year (the 37th year of the Republic of China, 1948), I have been practicing the "Yinshizi Meditation Method" for exactly twenty-seven months, without interruption for a single day. Now I am willing to create a report, very faithfully and objectively, about my actual experience of these twenty-seven months, and tell it to the world. Why did I want to learn the meditation method?

My body was relatively strong. Before middle age, I could endure hardship in reading, writing, and working. Even if the work was a little heavier or the sleep was a little less, I would not feel very tired. Unexpectedly, after the age of fifty, I suddenly discovered that I had high blood pressure. Sometimes my blood pressure was as high as 190 degrees or more. Although I received injections and took medicine, there was no reduction. During the War of Resistance against Japan, I moved from western Shanghai to Sichuan, running around to various places, and my work did not stop. In the early winter of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), I suffered a major hemorrhage. After the bleeding stopped, my blood pressure remained high, sometimes reaching over 200 degrees. As a result, my body became increasingly thin, and I could no longer do any work that required the use of my brain. At that time, I was already sixty years old. In the spring of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), I returned from Chongqing to my residence in Shanghai, thinking, now that I have arrived in Shanghai, personnel affairs are complicated, and things cannot be left undone, what should I do? I happened to be employed at the Hongying Library, and Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang was in charge of the library. I assisted him. Mr. Zhu persuaded me to learn the meditation method, saying, "If you meditate for a long time, it will definitely cure your illness." I had already read one volume of Mr. Zhu's book "Yinshizi Meditation Method" more than twenty years ago. At that time, I even meditated occasionally, so now I read it in detail again and decided to give it a try. Thus, I formally began on April 27th of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946).

At the beginning of learning meditation, I immediately determined two aspirations.

I deeply believe that this meditation method can strengthen the body and is sufficient to cure my high blood pressure. I also deeply learned from the past mistake of meditating occasionally. Therefore, I set two aspirations in advance: One is "determination," believing that if I do not learn meditation, then so be it, but once I learn it, I must deeply believe in the effectiveness of this method, and never doubt it, and never fear difficulties. The other is "perseverance," believing that once I have made the determination to meditate, I must persevere, and no matter how difficult or busy I am, I will never let it be interrupted for a single day. After these two aspirations were determined, I began to implement them. In the first few months after implementation, I encountered quite a few obstacles and difficulties, but I always adhered to the determination to persist to the end, regarding it as the same as eating and sleeping, thinking that if I lacked it, I would not be able to complete my life. Therefore, in the past twenty-seven months, there has not been a single day of interruption. At this time, I can boldly say that not only have I not interrupted it for more than two years, but from now on, I will not interrupt it for a single day, and now that I have entered the state of practice, I am even more "unable to stop."

The meditation methods and techniques I use are all based on what is said in Mr. Zhu's book, and sometimes I have also received oral instructions from him. When meditating, I sit in a single lotus position (because I am older, I cannot sit in a double lotus position), my waist is straight, my eyes are slightly closed, and my right hand holds the back of my left hand, placed on my calf (but sometimes both hands can also be placed on my knees). I perform deep and slow breathing, contracting my abdomen when inhaling and protruding my abdomen when exhaling, so that the diaphragm moves; at the same time, my brain is quiet, striving to prevent stray thoughts from arising, and concentrating on the abdomen. Each meditation session lasts about one hour, or fifty minutes. When the weather is cold in winter, I perform it at night before going to bed. In the other three seasons, I perform it in the morning after getting up. I do it once a day as a regular practice. (Sometimes I also do it twice.) One inhalation and one exhalation is one unit, and I usually silently count the breaths, one, two, three, four, five..., up to one hundred times as a group. Using a natural attitude and effort, I gradually extend the breathing time. When sitting, I sit on the bed, sometimes padding with soft objects to make my buttocks slightly higher and my knees lower, so that my upper body leans slightly forward.

(But it doesn't matter if you don't pad with soft objects.)
