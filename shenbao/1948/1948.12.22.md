### Decision on the Full List of the New Cabinet: To Be Submitted to the Central Political Committee for Approval and Announcement Today; Xu Yongchang to Take Office as Minister of National Defense

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] The full list of cabinet members for the Sun Ke Cabinet has been decided and will be submitted to the Kuomintang Central Political Committee meeting at 10:00 AM on the 22nd for approval and announcement. The original plan was to submit the list to the Central Political Committee on the 21st. However, because Mr. Sun had not yet made a final decision on a small number of candidates on his original list, he continued to consult with various parties throughout the 21st before finally finalizing the list. The first meeting of the new Executive Yuan, originally scheduled for the 22nd, will also be chaired by the Weng Cabinet for its final regular meeting. Furthermore, before the Central Political Committee meeting on the morning of the 22nd, a meeting of the Central Standing Committee will be held first to approve the case of Wu Tiecheng as Vice President of the Executive Yuan. Both the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee meetings will be personally chaired by the President.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] After inquiry, the final decision on the full list of cabinet members for the Sun Cabinet is roughly as follows: Wu Tiecheng concurrently serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hong Lanyou as Minister of Interior, Liu Weizhi as Minister of Industry and Commerce, Xu Kan as Minister of Finance, Pang Songzhou as Director-General of Budget, Guan Jiyu as Minister of Food, Zhong Tianxin as Minister of Water Conservancy, Gu Zhenggang as Minister of Social Affairs, Yu Dawei as Minister of Communications, Wu Shangying as Minister of Land Affairs, Li Zheng as Minister of Education, Xu Yongchang as Minister of National Defense, Lin Kesheng as Minister of Health, Mei Ru'ao as Minister of Judicial Administration, Zuo Shunsheng as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Sun Yueqi as Chairman of the National Resources Commission, Bai Yunti as Minister of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs, Chen Ce as Minister of Overseas Chinese Affairs, and Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Weng Wenhao, and Chen Lifu as Political Councilors. Another candidate, yet to be determined, will be nominated by the Youth Party.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Regarding the Reuter's report tonight citing a conversation with a certain decision-making person, which involved the new cabinet's policy choices on war and peace and the advance and retreat of the government's top leaders, inquiries to officials here received no definitive answers. There was also no information about the report's claim that the new cabinet's so-called peace is not surrender and that it will strive to strengthen itself militarily, diplomatically, and politically, and invite related countries to mediate.

[Reuter's Nanjing Office, 21st] The simultaneous announcement by Premier Sun Ke of the formation of a wartime cabinet and his willingness to negotiate a "glorious peace" with the Chinese Communists may have been approved by President Chiang, since all previous discussions about peace were classified as subversive actions punishable by severe penalties. It is too early to gauge the overall reaction to this announcement on the morning of the 21st. However, among U.S. officials and liberal elements within the Kuomintang, this announcement is expected to be met with the greatest approval.

### War Flames Gradually Approach the City Walls of Tianjin: The Focus Is on the Northern Suburbs, with Intense Gunfire; Only Small Bands of Bandit Troops Harassing the Outskirts of Peiping

[Report from Our Tianjin Office, 21st] The war outside Tianjin is gradually approaching the city's defensive works. There is fighting in the villages of Yixingbu and Dingzigu in the north of Tianjin, Dongjuzi in the east, Huidui and Baitangkou in the south, and Yangliuqing in the west. Combat fortifications at various intersections in the city have now been generally completed, entering a state of firm defense.

[Report from Our Tianjin Office, 21st] The focus of the war around Tianjin remains in the north of the city. From 4:00 AM to about 10:00 AM on the 21st, the sound of artillery fire was intense, interspersed with gunfire, constantly reaching the city. According to military releases, the National Army launched a proactive attack on the morning of the 21st. On the evening of the 20th, over a thousand bandits attacked Yixingbu, Liutan, and Dingzigu in the north of Tianjin. After being bombarded by the National Army's artillery, the bandits retreated slightly. The National Army launched an assault on the bandits at dawn on the 21st, and they remained in a standoff at noon. [Another dispatch] Fierce fighting broke out again on the Yixingbu, Liutan, and Dingzigu line in the north of Tianjin on the afternoon of the 21st. The bandits launched five or six fierce assaults, all of which were repelled. The sound of artillery fire became even more intense in the evening. According to military sources, on the evening of the 20th, the 62nd and 63rd Brigades of the bandits and 2,000 local troops were discovered trying to cross the Jian River by building a bridge. They were subjected to intense gunfire from the Xiaozhan National Army, and the bandits suffered 600-700 casualties.

[Report from Our Tianjin Office, 21st] It is reported that a strong Marine Corps of the National Army arrived in Tanggu by land on the 21st, but this has not been officially confirmed.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] The artillery fire around Tianjin City was loud at 4:00 AM on the 21st, with intermittent machine gun fire, gradually subsiding after 9:00 AM. According to the Garrison Command, a powerful army of ours around Tianjin began actively engaging the bandits in combat on the 21st. The sounds of gunfire in the morning were the prelude to our action. A certain unit commander said that the National Army has made complete deployments and will deal a fatal blow to the bandits. On the western front of Tianjin, after our army routed more than 2,000 bandits in Yangliuqing on the 20th, about 2,000 bandits from the 72nd Division again sneaked into Daliutan, Tianjin County, from Yongqing and Anci on the evening of the 20th, and launched exploratory attacks near Yangliuqing, where fierce fighting is currently underway. The main force of the bandits in the north of Tianjin has been fiercely attacking the northwestern outskirts of the city since the 18th, in the Tianqimiao and Yixingbu area. General Lin Weichou, Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Army Commander of a powerful army in the area, personally commanded at the front line and encouraged all officers and soldiers to vow to coexist with the position, with extremely high morale. He gave the invading bandits a head-on blow. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the bandits have collapsed, and many have been captured. Detailed battle results are under investigation.

[Report from Our Beiping Office, 21st] There was fierce fighting in the southwestern suburbs of Beiping last night and this morning, and the sound of gunfire could be heard throughout the city. After 9:30 PM last night, the 5th Column of Lin Biao's bandit troops infiltrated in two groups from the Daijing area outside Guang'anmen under the cover of darkness. One group infiltrated the area west of Baiyunguan and Yuanning Temple outside Xibianmen via the Racecourse and Yunhuachi. The other group broke into Dapiying outside Guang'anmen, only a few li from Guang'anmen, and immediately engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army. The National Army coordinated infantry and artillery, bombarding with fierce artillery fire for an hour. The bandits were defeated and retreated towards the Caishenmiao area. Corpses littered both sides of the road outside Guang'anmen. At the same time last night, a small group of bandit troops harassed the area from outside Guangqumen to outside Yongdingmen in the southern suburbs and were repelled by the National Army.

[Report from Our Beiping Office, 21st] The fighting on the outskirts of Beiping was relatively calmer today. At 9:00 PM on the 20th, small groups of bandit troops were discovered near Luotuowan, Weiqiangjiao, and Lianhuachi in the southwest of Beiping. After being encircled and suppressed by the National Army, they engaged in fierce fighting for two hours and retreated southwest after being unable to withstand the pressure, with over 3,000 bandits killed. At noon on the 21st, small groups of bandits were active between the Princess Tomb and Chongxingsi in the west of Beiping. The National Army coordinated infantry and artillery to intercept them, and after an hour and a half of fighting, more than 250 bandits were killed. The bandits retreated west of the Princess Tomb. The outskirts of Beiping were calm in the afternoon.

[United Press, Beiping, 21st] Surrounded by the Communist army, Beiping has become a courageous but uneasy city. The city's more than two million residents are waiting for a change, and it is currently impossible to predict when the flames of war will spread from the suburbs to the city. Military camps can be seen everywhere in the city, and many hutongs have artillery positions, making it impossible for cars to pass. The front of the police station and government agencies are piled high with sandbags, and the soldiers defending the city are closely watching the movements of the Communist army outside the city, ready to fire artillery as soon as the enemy approaches. Beiping is under curfew every night from 10:00 PM, so residents have no social life. There are roughly two types of foreigners remaining in Beiping: one is anxious about the future situation and at a loss; the other pretends to be calm about the current situation or is truly indifferent. The major hotels have few guests, and the desolation is like a tomb. Regular telephone service between Beiping and Tianjin was interrupted on Saturday, but telegrams are still normal.

[Report from Our Beiping Office, 21st] It is learned here that Xu Yongchang was commissioned to come to Peiping to meet with Fu Zuoyi, and returned to Nanjing late on the 19th to report to President Chiang.

### American Nationals are Reluctant to Leave the Ancient Capital: No One Has Applied to Evacuate

[United Press, Beiping, 21st] Regardless of how the future situation develops, no American nationals in Beiping have currently applied to evacuate. Of the original 708 American nationals in this area, 255 remain, including 87 employees of the U.S. Consulate and the Economic Cooperation Administration and their families, as well as students of language schools. Three senior U.S. military officials and four foreign reporters, who came to Beiping from Nanjing for sightseeing, are also forced to stay here and cannot return. There are still 13 American nationals within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Consulate in Beiping who are willing to stay within the jurisdiction, including two in Tongxian and several in the Yanjing and Qinghua University areas in the northwestern suburbs of Beiping. At 4:30 this morning, an American national was born in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. He is the second son of Mr. Sharonberger, the director of the Chinese language school run by the U.S. State Department in Peiping, and weighs seven pounds.

### 5,000 Soldiers and Civilians in Peiping Rush to Build the Temple of Heaven Airfield

Successful Test Landing at Tianjin's New Airfield

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] The Temple of Heaven airfield is being rushed to completion by 5,000 soldiers and civilians. The trees around the site have been felled, and the ground is being watered by the fire brigade and flattened by giant bulldozers and rollers. According to the person in charge of the construction, after completion, this airfield will be about three times larger than the Dongdan airfield and comparable to the Nanyuan airfield in the western suburbs, and there will be no problem for giant aircraft to land.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] It is reported that a C47 aircraft successfully made a test landing at Tianjin's new airfield on the 21st. Personnel from the local civil aviation team have contacted Shanghai to send planes to Tianjin.

### Peiping City Actively Promotes Wartime Administrative Work: The Joint Army and Civilian Self-Defense Corps Is Formed, with Chu Xichun as Commander; Routine Work of the Provincial and Municipal Governments Is Temporarily Suspended

[Report from Our Beiping Office, 22nd] Wartime administrative work in Peiping is being actively launched. The North China Pacification Headquarters, the Hebei Provincial Government, and the Peiping Municipal Government have jointly formed the Peiping Joint Army and Civilian Self-Defense Work Corps, responsible for promoting the maintenance of order, army-civilian cooperation, mobilizing the public, and eliminating bandits and traitors. Chu Xichun is the commander, and there is a guiding group consisting of Yu Jianqi, Cheng Houzhi, Yang Qingzhi, Tian Zhusheng, Gao Lanbo, and Han Da. In addition to this group, there are four working groups: the social order group, the public training group, the publicity and consolation group, and the army-civilian cooperation group. Each district will have a sub-corps, with the police precinct chief as the sub-corps commander and the district head as the sub-corps deputy commander. Each bao will also have a working group. Most of the routine work of the provincial and municipal governments has been temporarily suspended, and manpower is being concentrated to strengthen grassroots organizations and cooperate with the war effort.

### Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan May Be Held the Day After Tomorrow: Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan and Others Submit Resignations

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] After Sun Ke announced the formation of his new cabinet, the initial reaction of the Legislative Yuan was the issue of re-electing the President and Vice President, because President Sun Ke and Vice President Chen Lifu have both joined the cabinet. Wu Tiecheng, who was rumored to be a possible candidate for President of the Legislative Yuan, has also taken office as Vice President of the Executive Yuan, so both the President and Vice President must be re-elected. However, because Chen Lifu's appointment to the cabinet has not yet been formally announced, the Legislative Yuan did not discuss the re-election issue on the 21st, but it is generally expected that the re-election will be held on the 24th. The 21st was the date of the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting, and the attendance of legislators in the morning was very enthusiastic. There was frequent contact in the meeting place. At 12:00 noon, the New Politics Club of the Legislative Yuan held a 14-seat discussion, and democratic and freedom societies held a joint meeting at the Overseas Chinese Guest House to exchange views on the candidates for President and Vice President. Wu Tiecheng also participated. A mock vote was held at the meeting to test the candidates for President. As a result, Tong Guanxian received the most votes, followed by Wang Puhan. It is heard that the three groups will use this test vote as a basis for their decision. Another group of organizations, such as the Reform Club, the Zheng You Society, and the Zhong Society, also exchanged views in the evening. The Reform Club held a meeting of its executive committee and decided to support Cheng Tianfang's candidacy for President. In addition, they also expressed support for Li Zheng, Qi Shiying, Liu Wendao, and Zou Shuwen, and decided to hold a general membership meeting at noon on the 22nd to solicit the opinions of all members. The decision of the Reform Club is said to have the support of the Zheng You Society and the Zhong Society. As for the proposal by some legislators in the past to nominate Yan Huiqing as President, because Yan is old and weak and unable to bear the heavy responsibility, and the original proposal to nominate Liu Jianqun as Vice President has also failed to obtain unanimous agreement, it is currently impossible to accurately predict who will be elected as President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. In addition, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, Yan Guofu, Deputy Secretary-General, and the main staff of the Secretariat have all submitted their resignations to President Sun, but Mr. Sun has not yet approved them.

### Legislative Yuan Requests That the Confiscation of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Carried by Domestic Travelers Be Stopped, and Guizhou Be Designated as a Special Sales Area for Salt

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] The 30th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 21st, chaired by Chen Lifu. After reading the minutes of the previous meeting in the morning, the reports were all approved, including the President's request for investigation regarding the declaration of martial law in all provinces and cities across the country, the Executive Yuan's request for review of the draft Foreign Exchange Management Regulations, the draft Regulations on Suppression of Rebellion Military Law, and the draft Regulations on Salt Tax Assessment. The discussion then began. Two cases were passed in the morning, one being the draft amendment to the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Social Affairs, which had been discussed for many days. The crux of the matter was the organization in Article 4 of the law, on which the opinions of the members were very divided. However, when the vote was taken, it was still passed according to the review opinion. The other was the draft Regulations on the Establishment of Accounting Agencies and Personnel in Local Governments and Their Affiliated Agencies. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. The meeting continued in the afternoon, and the following were passed: the Organizational Regulations of the Huludao Port Authority of the Ministry of Communications, the Abolition of Subsidiary Currency Regulations, three cases related to the Regulations on Land Disposal in the Sui District and the Sui District Land Bonds, the Public Enterprise Trade Union Law, the referral of the Central Guoshu Institute to the National Education and Culture Committee for review, the International Telecommunication Convention, the Regulations on Encouraging Overseas Chinese to Return to China to Invest in Industry, the formulation of minimum wage standards to maintain the livelihood of workers, the request to the Executive Yuan to promptly strengthen local self-defense forces and expand the security forces of various provinces, the reactivation of veterans and demobilized officers to strengthen the suppression of rebellion forces, the suspension of the application of the part of the election laws related to the investigation of candidates for public office, and the request to designate Guizhou as a special sales area for salt to save the lives of the people due to the soaring salt prices in Guizhou, which affect people's livelihood. Finally, two temporary motions were passed: (1) Zhang Qingzhen and others proposed that the Executive Yuan be requested to promptly order the Ministry of Finance to stop customs personnel from arbitrarily confiscating the gold, silver, and foreign currency of domestic travelers, so as to comply with government orders and facilitate travel. After discussion, in order to save time and quickly stop this illegal confiscation, it was decided to change it to an inquiry case and submit it to the Executive Yuan, and it was hoped that a result would be obtained at the next meeting and a report would be submitted. (2) Wang Zemin and others proposed that after the adjournment of this session, all legislators who return to their hometowns should assist local governments in organizing and training the public and strengthening self-defense forces. After discussion, it was decided to submit it to the National Defense Committee for review before submitting it to the general meeting for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

### Draft Regulations on Salt Tax Assessment

Legislative Yuan Refers to the Finance and Economics Committee for Review

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Regarding the salt tax reform case, the Executive Yuan previously approved the plan to change "levy by quantity" to "levy by value" on the 4th. After the Ministry of Finance modified the relevant provisions of the Salt Administration Regulations accordingly, it has drafted the Draft Regulations on Salt Tax Assessment and requested the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The Legislative Yuan reported on this at its regular meeting on the 21st and referred it to the Finance and Economics Committee for review. It is learned that the collection of salt tax based on value will be calculated based on the average salt price in important locations in various production and sales areas across the country, minus the actual cost of needs after deducting the original tax amount, according to the following percentages: A. Salt Tax: (1) Sea salt: 70%. (2) Well salt sold in Guizhou: 15%. (3) Well salt sold in other regions other than Guizhou: 40%. (4) Pond salt sold in Shaanxi: 5%. (5) Pond salt sold in other regions other than Shaanxi: 60%. (6) Local salt and Qing salt: 30%. B. Fishing salt and salt for use: 5%. C. Industrial salt and agricultural salt are exempt from tax. Salt that is specially permitted for export and import shall be subject to salt tax in addition to customs duties, and the tax rate shall be determined separately. However, the Ministry of Finance may, depending on the domestic production and sales situation, submit a report to the Executive Yuan for approval to exempt its salt tax. The purpose of this method is to balance salt prices, equalize the burden on the people, eliminate profiteering, prevent hoarding, coordinate with prices, stabilize the sales market, and ensure the treasury revenue and supply for the suppression of rebellion.

[Report from Our Hankou Office, 21st] Amidst the tranquility and serenity here, a report in a Hong Kong newspaper carried the news that Wuhan and Xinyang were under pressure. Readers laughed it off.

### The Shanghai Yangzi Company Hoarding Case: The Censorate Issues an Impeachment: Wu Guozhen, Yu Shuping, Huo Baoshu, and Others Are All Involved

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Censorate issued an impeachment on the 21st by Censors Xiong Zaixiao and Jin Yueguang regarding the hoarding case of the Yangzi Construction Company, with a full text of about 12,000 words. It was decided at the Censorate's regular meeting in October to send personnel to investigate the hoarding of large quantities of materials by the Shanghai Yangzi Construction Company. The President of the Censorate then assigned Censors Xiong Zaiwei and Jin Yueguang to Shanghai to conduct an on-site investigation, which lasted only two months. According to the investigation results of Censors Xiong and Jin, Yangzi Company hoarded 3,000-4,000 boxes of Western medicine, pigments, cosmetics, and daily necessities made of glass. In addition, the Lihan Company, which has close ties with Yangzi Company, has 75 new cars and 10 trucks in stock. Even if calculated at the lowest current value, the total is more than 20 million Gold Yuan. Mr. Xiong and others believe that Kong Lingkan, the general manager of the company, is suspected of taking advantage of his power to evade taxes, hoarding goods for speculation, and illegally profiting. The Yangzi Construction Company should be subject to a business suspension penalty, and the judicial part should be transferred to the court for handling. The two censors also believe that Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Police Chief Yu Shuping, Police Chief of the Police Squad Cheng Yikuan, Huang Zubei, Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau, and Huo Baoshu, Chairman of the Import and Export Management Committee, and Zhang Yongnian, Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, all have dereliction of duty and have also been impeached together. The case was established on the morning of the 21st after being reviewed by Censors Liu Yantao, Wang Xiangchen, and Wang Shulin, and was immediately sent to the Executive Yuan for handling. The Censorate recently issued the full text of the impeachment as follows:

Since the beginning of October this year, after newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai published the news that Shanghai Yangzi Construction Company was hoarding large quantities of materials, public opinion was in an uproar. The court decided to send personnel to investigate the case; Zaiwei and Yueguang were assigned to go to Shanghai to investigate. The facts of the case and those who should be impeached are described below:

(A) Part of the facts

(Zi) The occurrence of this case: This case was discovered by the Lujiawan Branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau on September 29 this year when it found large trucks smuggling materials. It was found that the second floor of the Lihua Automobile Company was hoarding large quantities of Western medicine, woolen cloth, pigments, Vaseline, etc., as well as 70 new cars and 10 trucks, which were said to belong to Yangzi Construction Company. Patrol Officer Ying Pinxiang immediately requested a report to the Shanghai Police Bureau. After receiving the report, the Police Bureau handed it over to the Economic Police Squad to send personnel to investigate. This is the discovery of a major hoarding case that shocked Shanghai. In fact, the occurrence of this case was earlier than September 19. According to the squad member, Kong Lingkan had verbally reported the hoarding of materials on September 19 and reported it in writing to Ji Dezun, the group leader of the inspection group of the team, that a large number of materials were stored in a car shop on Maoming South Road, and requested that personnel be sent to investigate. On the same day, Group Leader Ji signed the original report "It is proposed that Comrade Zhao Hongkuan of this group and Comrade Mao Xinfu of the action group go for a secret investigation." It was sent to the team leader of the team, Cheng Yikuan, for approval. Team Leader Cheng approved it on the 23rd. On the 24th, Zhao Hongkuan and others reported: Briefly stating that the car shop is named Lihan Automobile Company, and the household registration section of the Lujiawan Police Branch does not have the name of the car shop owner. In the large repair shop upstairs, there are several large warehouses of the same kind, containing dozens of wooden boxes. When approaching the window, you can vaguely see the contents, but because you cannot enter, you do not know what is stored. Please issue a duty certificate to find out. However, the team did not deal with it, resulting in the occurrence of this case on September 29. (To be continued)

### After Reporting to Truman, Hoffman Gave a Speech: The $70 Million China Construction Project Is Decided to Be Suspended

[Report from Our Agency] Washington, 21st Broadcast: Economic Cooperation Agency Director Hoffman met with Truman at the White House for half an hour on the 21st to report on his trip to Europe and the Far East. After the meeting, Mr. Hoffman gave a speech saying that in view of the urgent situation in China, the $70 million China construction project has been suspended. This measure was decided in consultation with Raphaelson in Shanghai. Mr. Hoffman said that the ECA has decided to continue some construction projects, including the Taiwan power plant, the reconstruction of the South China Railway, and the wharf project at the Qingdao U.S. Navy base. The ECA may ask Congress to continue to allocate funds to advance the ECA plan until the end of June next year. He said that the situation in China is volatile and it is not possible to determine long-term construction projects. The situation in China must be clearer than it is now before the ECA can plan a long-term funding request.

### The Huai-Bei National Army Crosses the Xie River; The Liu-Chen Bandit Forces Cannot Be Employed Without a Long Period of Reorganization and Replenishment; Rumor that General Huang Wei has been Captured, Bandit Leader Liu Bocheng has Been Bombed to Death

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Bengbu, 21st] After more than twenty days of fierce fighting on the Bengbu-Su County battlefield, the situation is now calming down. The Liu-Chen bandit forces have suffered heavy losses in this battle and cannot be employed without a long period of reorganization and replenishment. On the National Army side, there also seems to be some anticipation for the next action. According to military sources, the Du Yuming unit on the northern front has not made new progress due to unfavorable weather conditions in the past two days; the National Army on the Zhubu front has now advanced to the north of Xinqiao. Furthermore, Liu Zhi is still staying in Bengbu to command, and he is unlikely to leave in the next few days.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Bengbu, 21st] There is no fighting south of the Xie River, and the remnant bandits have all fled north. According to a statement from the Suppression Headquarters, the Du Yuming unit on the northern front began sweeping up the Chen bandit forces around Qinglongji yesterday.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Bengbu, 21st] Officers and soldiers who were separated from the Huang Wei Corps during the breakout have been arriving in Bengbu one after another in recent days and are being received by a certain logistics organization. Furthermore, a part of the corps that broke out westward has now reached the vicinity of Mengcheng.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Bengbu, 21st] It is reported that General Huang Wei has already been captured. Furthermore, it is widely rumored here that the bandit Liu Bocheng was bombed to death by the air force on the 12th in a settlement in   County (forty li from Su County on the north bank of the Hui River), and his body has been transported to Tiefo Temple.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Bengbu, 21st] The Suppression Headquarters issued a public statement today stating: (1) After the Huai-Bei National Army cleared out the bandits between the Fei and Xie Rivers, they braved the rain on the 20th to cross the Xie River northward and advanced towards Guzhen and Mengcheng. (2) The large corps commanded by General Du Yuming has been engaged in fierce battles with the bandits between Yongcheng and Su County for more than half a month, depleting the main force of the Chen Yi bandit forces, and is currently sweeping up the bandits around Qinglongji in the east of Yongcheng.

### Editorial: Protest Against Arming Japan!

The news that the United States is stepping up the arming of Japanese troops has been constantly circulating recently. The U.S. authorities not only do not deny it but also express a deep interest in it. Our country is geographically adjacent to Japan and has deeply felt the pain of aggression for seventy years. If Japanese militarism is revived, the threat to our country will be very significant. Therefore, based on the standpoint of national security and the standpoint of the Allied powers controlling Japan, we should lodge a serious protest against the United States' stepping up the arming of Japan!

Since Japan surrendered three years ago, under the sole control of the United States, the old forces have gradually revived and risen. Regarding the issue of Japanese armament, there was the establishment of the Maritime Safety Agency and the restoration of 125,000 armed police officers. Our public opinion protested the establishment of the Maritime Safety Agency, believing that this was equivalent to the restoration of the Ministry of the Navy. The U.S. authorities and the Allied Headquarters said that the Maritime Safety Agency was an anti-smuggling organization and had no armed equipment. Our public opinion protested the restoration of 125,000 Japanese police officers, citing the example of Germany rebuilding the Nazi army with 100,000 police officers after World War I, arousing the high alert of the United States and the Allied Headquarters. The U.S. authorities and the Allied Headquarters said that Japan needed this self-defense force to maintain public order and suppress reactionaries. At meetings of the Far Eastern Commission, the Allied powers protested the arming of Japan, and the U.S. representative denied everything. The Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo was only allowed to listen to MacArthur's "peaceful Japan" instructions and was not allowed to raise questions about "arming Japan." In fact, this fait accompli already exists and is continuing to develop. Except for the Japanese, almost no one believes that the United States' arming of Japan is not a fact.

Recently, due to deviations in the United States' Far Eastern policy, the theory of actively supporting Japan has become increasingly prevalent. In terms of rhetoric, U.S. officials and even public opinion openly support the revival of Japan. Some even believe that the rise of Japan is beneficial to the future Far Eastern situation. In terms of action, the U.S. authorities' arming of Japan is not only manifested in the economic and ideological spheres but also in the political sphere, gradually reviving the declining militarism. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 13th of this month, the United States is considering establishing an armed police force of 100,000 to 150,000 in Japan so that Japan will not become a vacuum after the withdrawal of the occupying forces. A senior U.S. government official publicly expressed keen interest on the 20th and pointed out that this proposal was advocated by Acheson, MacArthur's former assistant in Japan, and naturally supported by MacArthur. Diplomats believe that Japan has a total population of 80 million, and Acheson only advocates 150,000 armed troops, which is not a large number. What the United States fears now is that this proposal will be strongly opposed by the Soviet Union when it is submitted to the Far Eastern Commission. In fact, this plan that threatens Far Eastern security and violates the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy towards Japan will likely be opposed by any country in the Far Eastern Commission other than the United States.

The Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions are the highest guidelines for the Allied powers' control of Japan. The future peace treaty with Japan will also use this principle as the standard for the treaty. The Allied Headquarters in Tokyo was originally the agency for the Far Eastern Commission to implement the occupation and control, but for the past three years, the Allied Headquarters' implementation of occupation and control policies has been entirely determined by one country's ideology and one country's defense, and it has not truly implemented the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions. Therefore, the errors in the Allied Headquarters' policy of controlling Japan today are entirely the result of deviations in the United States' Far Eastern policy. Acheson is MacArthur's Japanese think tank. When he was serving in Japan, perhaps because he was anesthetized by the Japanese sweet talk, he tried his best to support Japan's economic, armed, and ideological armament. Now that he has returned to the State Department, he has proposed to the government the recommendation to arm Japan with 150,000 troops, which may be accepted by the government and may be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission for forced recognition after a fait accompli has been created. We believe that this measure that violates the Potsdam Declaration and threatens peace in the Far East is extremely unreasonable. Based on the standpoint of national security, our country should oppose this willful measure. Based on the standpoint that our country bears the responsibility of the Allied powers to control Japan, it should seek diplomatic channels to correct the errors of Acheson's proposal. In any case, we cannot remain silent about the United States' arming of Japan. The soon-to-be-established Sun Cabinet, I wonder what the diplomatic authorities will do about this?

### The Ministry of Education Completes the Revision of Required Courses for University Departments, to be Implemented from the Freshman Year of the Next Academic Year

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 21st] The course schedules for the eight colleges of liberal arts, science, law, medicine, agriculture, engineering, commerce, and normal schools were promulgated and implemented successively between the years of 27 and 28. The courses for the four colleges of liberal arts, science, law, and normal schools were revised again in the 33rd year. Since its implementation, schools have felt that the courses are too complicated, the required credits are too many, and basic training cannot achieve advanced tasks. As a result, both teaching parties are restricted by regulations and cannot develop their strengths according to their aspirations. Therefore, the Ministry of Education instructed the responsible personnel to start revising the required courses for various university departments, and used the principles of (1) focusing on basic training, (2) concentrating courses, and (3) reducing required credits as the standard for revision. Since the 34th year, the opinions of various universities have been solicited first, and the Ministry has formulated a draft in accordance with the above principles, sent it to experts for comments, and made preliminary revisions based on these comments. Review meetings were convened separately with the course schedules of each department as a unit. After careful discussion and careful decision-making, it took three years to complete. It is now known that this revised required course schedule for the Academy of Entering Studies has been ordered to be promulgated to universities across the country, and will be implemented from the first year of the 38th academic year. The important contents that are different from before are as follows: (1) Focusing on basic training, reducing required credits, and concentrating courses, so that each school can adjust according to its talent and equipment. (2) The common required courses for all departments, Chinese and the first foreign language, are both listed as eight credits and studied for one year. Each school may conduct rigorous examinations on the Chinese and first foreign language levels of freshmen before they start classes in the first year. If the results are excellent and indeed exceed the first year of university level, they may be exempted from studying, and the credits will be reduced by half, but they must select other courses to make up the credits that should be completed at graduation. In addition, each school may designate professors to organize a language committee to specialize in guiding study and grade assessment. (3) All departments may not be divided into groups unless approved. If it is really necessary, professors may guide students to study the subjects they should study according to their wishes for elective courses, but if two departments are merged, they may be taught in groups with reference to the required course schedules of each department. (4) All common required courses for the departments should make every effort to open large classrooms (the three colleges of liberal arts, science, and law should preferably have a suitable large classroom for each department), and accommodate as many students as possible to attend classes together, and classes should not be set up separately by department in order to communicate with each other in the whole school, but the number of students in each language class should not exceed 40.

### The Siamese Government's Attitude is Stubborn, Insisting on Reducing the Immigration Quota; The Siamese Foreign Ministry Officially Replies to Our Note

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Bangkok, 20th] Our embassy in Siam received a formal reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning.

### Widely Rumored in Paris United Nations Circles – Indonesian Forces Recapture Capital Yogyakarta – Dutch Military Spokesman Denies It – Indonesia May Establish Government-in-Exile in India, Manila

[United Press, Paris, 21st] The Indonesian delegation to the United Nations announced on the 21st that the Indonesian Republican Army has recaptured Yogyakarta. The delegation also reported that almost all of West Java has risen up in revolt against the Netherlands, and two cities in East Java have also revolted. The delegation stated that the news of the recapture of Yogyakarta came from a Republican secret radio station in the tea region of Java. It also claimed that the Indonesian army has occupied the cities of Kebumen and Magelang, previously garrisoned by Dutch troops. The Indonesian side further claimed that 52 Dutch paratroopers were killed in combat.

[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] An Indonesian spokesperson said today that, according to news from Singapore, Indonesian troops have recaptured the capital city of Yogyakarta, and fierce fighting has broken out in the city. Fifty-two Dutch paratroopers were killed. This news was obtained from a state Indonesian secret radio station. At the same time, a Dutch military spokesman in The Hague considered this news to be false.

[Associated Press, New York, 21st] The New York Times reported today that, according to reliable sources, an Indonesian government-in-exile will be announced today, possibly in India.

[Associated Press, Manila, 21st] Indonesian Republican figures scattered around the world are in contact with each other today. It is rumored that Manila will be the location of the government-in-exile, but Indonesian figures believe it is still too early.

### U.S. to Recommend to Security Council – Order Dutch Troops to Cease Fire Immediately – Original Proposal for Dutch Troops to Withdraw to Original Defense Lines Not Agreed Upon by All Parties

[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] A spokesman for the U.S. delegation to the Security Council said today that the U.S. has abandoned its plan to demand that Dutch troops withdraw to the boundary lines prior to the attack on Indonesia.

The Australian government has ordered its representative to the Security Council to discuss further measures to resolve the dispute with representatives from various countries, especially the United Kingdom and the United States, such as holding elections in Indonesia immediately and considering placing Indonesia under a trusteeship system.

[United Press, Paris, 20th] At the personal request of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, the Security Council postponed consideration of the Indonesian war on the 20th. Mr. Molotov is in Moscow. U.S. Representative Jessup, greatly troubled by the outbreak of the Indonesian war, hastily flew here from his sickbed in Nice to attend the meeting scheduled for the 20th. He said that the U.S. government considers this crisis "very serious." Jessup requested that Security Council President Langehove make an "urgent appeal" to the Soviet Union, requesting that Soviet Representative Malik come to the meeting on the 21st if possible. At the request of Jessup and Syrian Representative Kurri, Langehove agreed to order the Mediation Committee to submit more reports on the Indonesian situation before the meeting on the 22nd. Jessup explained that it may be difficult to quickly obtain reports because the U.S. representative to the Mediation Committee, Cochran, is now in Batavia, while the Belgian and Australian representatives are in Karilang in the Republican area, and there is no communication between the two sides. Earlier, a U.S. spokesman had said that the U.S. had proposed that Malik leave Berlin by air, but Malik was unlikely to accept this. Soviet sources made people suspect that Malik would be able to arrive in time for the meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd.

[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] After holding an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council today, the Dutch government submitted a memorandum to the Council, stating that international intervention in the Indonesian incident would be of no avail. Continued negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia would also be of no benefit. The Indonesian Republic is to blame for failing to cooperate in fulfilling the agreement to establish the Indonesian Federation agreed upon on January 1 of this year.

[United Press, Sydney, 20th] Australian Federal Judge Kirby, Chairman of the United Nations Indonesian Mediation Committee, said on the 20th that the Security Council's rapid and forceful action can still end the conflict currently taking place in Indonesia.

### Arab League Asks Security Council – To Stop Dutch Military Actions

### Indonesian Minister to the U.S. Asks U.S. – To Stop Aid to the Netherlands – Support Indonesia Politically and Economically

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Indonesian Republican Minister Sumitro told reporters today that the Indonesian Republican government is determined to fight the Dutch military to the end. The new government will be established in Bukittinggi, Sumatra. If that place is occupied, it will be moved elsewhere. As long as the Indonesian Republic has territory, it will have a government. Eventually, a government-in-exile can be established. He dares to predict that the Dutch military will soon encounter significant resistance in the mountainous areas. To uphold justice, the U.S. should support Indonesia politically and economically. It should not be satisfied with mediation alone but should seriously consider cutting off aid to the Netherlands under the Marshall Plan and should support the Indonesian Republic in breaking the two-year Dutch blockade of Indonesian regional foreign trade.

### Rumor That Australian Mediator – Is Missing in Indonesia

[Our Newspaper] New York 21st Broadcast Batavia News: Rumors are circulating that the Australian representative to the Dutch-Indonesian Mediation Committee has suddenly gone missing. It is said that he went out for a picnic on the morning of the 19th and has been missing ever since, but this cannot be confirmed due to disrupted transportation.

### Judd Analyzes Indonesian Situation Through Chinese Lens – U.S. Refusal to Aid China Deemed Laughable

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Republican Congressman Judd, in a solo interview with a United Press reporter on the 21st, said: The Indonesian war is nothing less than a powder keg for the entire Far East. He continued: "Colonial wars will give the Soviet Union the best propaganda weapons. Soviet propagandists will seize the old banner of nationalism and declare that they can liberate Asia from white rule and gain freedom. Before the war, the Japanese shouted that Asia is for Asians. Although Japan has failed, this concept has taken root in the minds of many Asians. Although Japan's real meaning was simply that Asia is for Japanese, now the Soviet Union's imitation is just that Asia is for Soviet Union, but Asians will not realize this, because the Soviet Union is a hundred times smarter than Japan." Judd compared the situation in Indonesia with China. He said: The U.S. refuses to give aid to the Chinese government, "But at the same time, while the Netherlands is launching a war against Indonesia, we are supporting the Netherlands with aid from the economic recovery plan. I am not saying that we should exclude the Netherlands from the economic recovery plan, but if we still support Europeans who are fighting Asians and refuse to support Chinese who are fighting Chinese, it will be a very interesting contrast."

### Dutch Lower House – Rejects Communist Motion – Maintains Hostile Attitude Towards Indonesia

[Associated Press, The Hague, 21st] The Dutch Lower House last night passed a motion supporting Prime Minister Drees' policy towards Indonesia with 88 votes against a minority vote. Only the Communist Party voted against it, and the Communist Party's motion to immediately cease hostile actions failed as a result.

[Associated Press, The Hague, 20th] Dutch Prime Minister Drees announced at the war meeting on the Indonesian issue that someone in the audience shouted "Down with the colonial war, long live peace!" Three people were arrested and all旁臘者 (translates roughly to "onlookers") were expelled.

### Philippine Students Refuse to Listen – To Dutch Pianist's Performance – Expressing Protest Against Dutch Invasion of Indonesia

### Soviet Union Officially Attacks Netherlands – Accuses Dutch of Using Mediation Committee as a Trap to Destroy Indonesia – Long Intended to Settle Matters by Force

[Associated Press, London, 20th] Moscow Radio commentator Linitsky today accused the Netherlands of using the trap of the United Nations Mediation Committee to destroy the Indonesian Republic. It is claimed that the Mediation Committee, composed of representatives from the United States, Australia, and Belgium, ostensibly assists in resolving the Indonesian issue and supervising the ceasefire but actually serves as a smokescreen for foreign intervention in Indonesia. With the protection of the Committee, the plot to destroy Indonesia by means of dismemberment and blockade has matured, and the Committee is actually a conspiracy group. When conducting negotiations, the only goal of the Dutch authorities was to wait for a suitable opportunity to break them and create open warfare. The Dutch ruling class claims that this military action was forced upon them, but in fact, the Dutch military was always prepared to settle matters by force. The Netherlands does not use the ceasefire to seek peace but uses the opportunity to transfer troops and replenish its weapons with U.S. and British munitions. The Security Council will continue to discuss the Indonesian issue on the 22nd, and the Soviet Union's attitude can be seen in the above remarks.

### U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Appeal – Tojo and Others Soon to Die – MacArthur Can Order Secret Execution at Any Time

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Allied officials announced on the 21st that they believe the execution of Tojo and his colleagues will not take place within at least 24 hours. Sources said that after receiving formal notification that the U.S. Supreme Court has refused to intervene in the war crimes trials, MacArthur will immediately order Tojo and the other six war criminals sentenced to death to be executed. It is generally believed that the execution may be announced at any time.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] MacArthur discussed the date and procedures for the execution by hanging of seven war criminals, including Tojo, with Eighth Army Commander Walker today.

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The U.S. Supreme Court today decided to reject the appeal of the Japanese war criminals by a vote of six to one. The rationale for the ruling stated: "The appellants were convicted by the Far East Military Tribunal, which was composed of the United States and the Allied nations currently occupying Japan. MacArthur was elected commander of the Allied forces, and the judgment of the military tribunal has been approved by MacArthur. In this situation, the U.S. court has no right to review, acknowledge, postpone, or abolish this judgment. For this reason, the appellants' request for habeas corpus is to be rejected." Although only seven Japanese war criminals applied for an appeal - Hirota, Doihara, Kido, Oka Takasumi, Sato, Shimada, and Togo - the Supreme Court's ruling applies to all 25 Japanese war criminals. All of these criminals will be executed under the supervision of MacArthur and presided over by the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in accordance with the original judgment of the Far East Tribunal.

### Wills of Seven Criminals – To Be Published After Death

The defendant's lawyer, Collins, said that the defendant has already served her sentence in Tokyo and cannot be tried again. Furthermore, D'Aquino married a Portuguese man, D'Aquino, and has become a Portuguese citizen, and the U.S. court may not try her again. Government lawyer De Valfar said that pre-trial detention cannot take effect, and D'Aquino's crime occurred before her marriage, so she can still be tried by the U.S. court.

### Italian and French Foreign Ministers – Wide-Ranging Talks

[Agence France-Presse, Gonna, 20th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and French Foreign Minister Schumann met here today for two and a half hours, which is closely related to Italy's future attitude towards the Western European powers.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] The British government today published a white paper announcing Britain's four-year plan to strive for economic self-sufficiency after 1952.

The white paper also acknowledges that if Britain's four-year plan is completed, other countries under the European Economic Cooperation General Office will feel a lack of gold pound holdings, but the white paper emphasizes that this plan is not fixed.

### Budget Amendment Finally Passed – Japanese Parliament to be Dissolved Soon – Allied Command to Take Action to Stop Japanese Labor Unrest

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] After the leaders of the Socialist, Democratic, and National Cooperative Parties met with General Hodges, the director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of MacArthur's headquarters, last night, they immediately rushed to compile an amended budget案(proposal). The opposition parties' proposal was submitted to the House of Representatives Personnel Committee last night, and it was reviewed and approved by the committee at 1:00 AM this morning. The Liberal Party will deny the validity of the resolution. At the same time, the cabinet held an emergency cabinet meeting at dawn to discuss countermeasures. As a result, the proposal to dissolve the parliament rapidly won, and people were sent to compromise with the opposition parties. At 8:00 AM this morning, the House of Representatives held a plenary session and passed the opposition parties' amended budget proposal reviewed by the Personnel Committee. This resolution was immediately transferred to the House of Councillors and was also passed. This budget proposal was finally established after three weeks of wind彼 (unknown significance).

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Allied Command will take drastic action to curb the recent wave of strikes that are jeopardizing Japan's economy. In a letter to Prime Minister Yoshida yesterday, MacArthur emphasized that neither Japanese labor nor management should hinder the acceleration of production. The seeds of the Japanese strike wave have been sown for a long time. Recently, the amendment to the National Public Service Law passed by the parliament, which prohibits government workers from collectively petitioning and the right to strike, has led to strike events. Heller, the head of the Labor Section of the Allied Command, spent the whole day today consulting with union leaders, requesting them to seek an agreement with the capital as soon as possible regarding wage disputes. The nationwide seafarers' strike in Japan has been going on for about 20 days, and 70% of loading and unloading operations have been halted, disrupting transportation and greatly affecting industrial production.

Both will be organized in accordance with existing American models.

### Investigation Meeting Determines Two Causes of the Jiangya Steamer Accident, Not Boiler Explosion, No Navigational Errors

[Our Dispatch] In order to thoroughly clarify the truth of the Jiangya Steamer accident and to listen to opinions from all sides on the case, the Ministry of Transportation dispatched Mr. Wang Fuyi, a counselor from the ministry, to Shanghai. Together with Mr. Hong Ruitao, director of the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau, he convened a meeting of 21 relevant organizations at 9:00 AM yesterday on the sixth floor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company building to conduct an investigation. The invited attendees included representatives from the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Committee Office, the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate, the Shanghai Port Headquarters, the China Maritime Pilots Association, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's General Union, the Shanghai Tongsha Pilot Association, the China Corporation Register of Shipping, the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Chinese Maritime Construction Society, the First Naval District Headquarters, the Chinese Marine Engineers' Association, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Waterborne Inspection Unit, the First Naval Military Region Headquarters, the Chinese Merchant Marine Officers' Association, the Ningbo Association, the Songhan Transportation Society, the National Shipping Industry Federation, and the Maritime Administration Bureau, totaling 21 units from the Ministry of Transportation. Captain Shen Dacai of the Jiangya Steamer and the chief mate also attended the meeting. The focus of the meeting was on studying two points: (1) the cause of the explosion on the Jiangya Steamer, and (2) whether the navigation route of the Jiangya Steamer was incorrect at the time of the accident. After the discussion began, representatives from all units spoke enthusiastically. The debate between the legal team of the Ningbo Association and the captain of the Jiangya Steamer was particularly intense. On the point of the cause of the explosion, opinions from all sides differed. The representative from the Navy believed that, based on observations of the traces, the explosion on the Jiangya Steamer may have been caused by encountering a drifting mine, but stated that it was impossible to make a definitive judgment. After research, because the Ningbo Association consistently failed to provide evidence to the contrary, the "preliminary decision" on the above two points was: (1) The Jiangya Steamer accident was not due to a boiler explosion. (2) The navigation route of the Jiangya Steamer was not incorrect at the time of the accident.

Furthermore, according to Director Hong of the Maritime Administration Bureau, regarding the cause of the Jiangya Steamer accident, the bureau will still work with the District Procuratorate, the Ningbo Association, and other relevant agencies to send personnel to the location where the Jiangya Steamer sank to continue on-site inspection.

### To Salvage the Difficult Situation of Current Industry: Industrial Loan Measures Decided to Be Relaxed; Interest Rates Reduced Separately, Deadlines Appropriately Extended; Applications for Acquisition by the Machinery Industry Generously Approved

[Our Report] For the sake of favoring the industrial sector, considerable revisions have been made to the industrial loan measures in terms of interest rates and deadlines. The Central Bank Discount Committee held its 19th meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Liu Gongyun. First, Lin Chong [name] reported that after the promulgation of the Emergency Loan Measures for Production Enterprises, there were many applications for the acquisition of finished products. The Review Committee has been actively reviewing them and has passed many acquisition cases after holding two meetings. A Finished Product Acquisition Evaluation Committee has been organized, with impartial figures from various departments of the industrial sector as members, to fairly assess acquisition prices and entrust the undertaking banks and bureaus to handle them accordingly, which is progressing smoothly. As for pledge loans, although measures have been decided, there are still many difficulties hindering implementation. Industrial circles believe that loan interest rates are high and deadlines are short, and the undertaking banks and bureaus are concerned about risks and unwilling to undertake them. All these problems must be solved to facilitate implementation. In particular, the machinery industry is in the most difficult situation and hopes for more leniency. After discussion by the committee members present, they all agreed that the current situation of the industrial sector is indeed very difficult, and the loan measures should be relaxed to overcome the difficulties. The machinery industry is particularly difficult, which is also true and should be given special preference. Based on the above principles, the following relaxed measures were passed:

(1) The industrial loan interest rate of the Discount Committee, originally set at 3.6% per month, is now uniformly reduced to 2.4% per month for the three types of industries (B, C, and D) under Article 4 of the Measures for Handling Review of Loan Cases. The Central Bank's re-pledge interest rate is reduced from 3.3% per month to 2%. The loan interest rate for various industries listed in Item A (including steel, hardware, machinery, shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, acid-base chemical raw materials, etc.) is reduced to 1.5% per month. The Central Bank's re-pledge interest rate is reduced to 1%.

(2) The maximum loan term for the three types of industries (B, C, and D) is uniformly extended from 30 days to 60 days. The term for various industries in Category A is 90 days. If necessary, extensions may be granted upon approval.

(3) National banks, bureaus, and commercial banks and firms should accept applications for loans from manufacturers with whom they do business, in accordance with the Discount Committee's discount rules. After investigation, they should quickly forward them to the committee for approval. All pledge procedures should still be handled in accordance with the discount rules.

(4) Applications for the acquisition of finished products by the machinery industry should be generously approved. The above passed items will be announced by the Discount Committee to the national banks, bureaus, and the three public associations of silver, money, and trust companies for consultation and handling. Eight loan cases related to transportation, public utilities, etc. were also passed. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.

### Overly Loose Monetary Situation

Yesterday, the monetary situation in this city remained overly loose. The supply of funds was extraordinarily strong both inside and outside the industry, while demand was very scarce. Problems with the overall situation have caused market sentiment to turn to wait-and-see. Therefore, general market transactions were very sluggish. The demand for cash chips was not strong either. Turnover was extremely flexible. Except for large bills, there was no longer any sign of discount. The market interest rate for interbank lending was generally around 15 yuan for overnight loans, with a minimum of 12 yuan for supply. At noon, 10 yuan was also seen being dumped.

### Good Financial Situation After Half-Yearly Interest Settlement

[Our Report] According to financial circles: After the half-yearly interest settlement in the financial sector of this city, the general situation is still maintainable. Although loan interest rates in the financial sector were severely restricted in August, September, and October of this year, which greatly affected business, the interest rates have been allowed to increase to a level not far from the market interest rates since December. Therefore, the business situation in December was quite good, and the Lunar New Year was able to be passed with relative ease. It is now determined that banks and firms in this city will compile financial statements on January 2nd and 3rd of next year.

In addition, according to sources in the banking industry: With the annual financial statement approaching, the business situation of the silver and money industry in this city, on average for the whole year, all have surpluses. National banks, bureaus, and public banks have particularly large profits. Commercial banks and firms with larger scope can earn around one million gold yuan in profit for the whole year, and ordinary ones also earn around tens of thousands of yuan. Currently, the year-end bonus issue for banks and firms can be resolved smoothly as a result.

### Financial Management General Inspection of Banks and Firms Scheduled to Be Completed in Three Days

The Shanghai Municipal Financial Administration Bureau began a general inspection of all banks and firms in the city yesterday. A total of 30 personnel were dispatched yesterday, divided into 15 groups. Those inspected yesterday were commercial banks, money shops, and trust companies. It is planned that the inspection of the entire city will be completed in three days. According to Bi Delin, Director of the Financial Administration Bureau, the purpose of launching this general inspection of all banks, firms, and trust companies in the city is to clarify the current capital flows and business conditions of general banks and firms, in order to provide a standard for the bureau's future financial management policies.

### Rice Flour and Cooking Oil Rise

Yesterday, the arrival of rice in the two markets hit a record high, totaling more than 18,000 dan. With depressed sentiment, sales were sluggish, and efforts to raise prices were weak. The situation in the southern rice market was stable at noon, tending towards stability. The prices of japonica and indica rice were each raised slightly by 10 yuan and 15 yuan, respectively. However, with supply exceeding demand, the market was not strong, and transactions became sluggish. The market trend then softened, resulting in an increase of only 10 yuan to 15 yuan. White japonica was 340 yuan, up 10 yuan; thin paddy was 345 yuan; early rice was 330 yuan; and Yangjian rice was 345 yuan, each up 15 yuan. White round rice was stable at 380 yuan, and Yin round rice was 350 yuan, up 15 yuan. Seasonal japonica was 350 yuan, up 10 yuan.

Due to rumors that the Central Agricultural Grain Department will continue to purchase 1 million bags, sentiment towards flour was optimistic. Cooking oil had both wholesale and retail sales, with vigorous buying interest and a price increase of about 10%. Miscellaneous grains: the market situation was flat, with supply and demand for soybeans and red sorghum being roughly equal, with little fluctuation. Raw peanuts were selling well annually, with the price in Yangzhou rising to 640 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan.

### Sugar Market Soars

The sugar market was strong yesterday. Each group bought more and sold less, with great market sentiment. Buying interest was strong on the market, with traders holding up prices and shouting prices flying.

No. 45 white sugar opened at 520 yuan in the morning. In the middle, there was intraday covering of short positions, with large players maneuvering. Retail sales were strong, and the market situation continued to rise, reaching a high of 555 yuan. At the close, some retail investors sold off, and the market price retreated slightly by 5 yuan, resulting in an overall increase of 65 yuan. Coarse sand and Xinghua white each rose by 30 yuan. The increase in the price of refined Zhuangqing was particularly strong, rising by 60 yuan. The remaining Hai red, Taiwan red, cotton red, and local ice sugar all rose in unison.

### Strong Demand from Guest Dealers: Cotton Yarn Market Remains Firm; Fabric Market Shows Vigor and Prosperity

Cotton yarn is firm, with the price of familiar brands rising sharply. Demand from Guangdong dealers is particularly strong, and there are sporadic purchases in the local market.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 180,000 yuan in the morning. In the middle, demand from all parties was very strong, and it finally closed at 190,000 yuan, resulting in an increase of 1,500 yuan compared to the weekend. 40-count Blue Phoenix also rose by 1,500 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon rose by 1,400 yuan, closing at 16,200 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 15,300 yuan and fell to a low of 15,000 yuan, then rose to a high of 16,000 yuan at the close, resulting in a final increase of 2,200 yuan. Warehouse receipts were priced as high as 14,800 yuan, then changed hands at 15,000 yuan the next day. 20-count Double Horse also traded well, rising sharply by 2,200 yuan. Golden City and Heavenly Maiden also hit new high prices. There were not many transactions for yarns of 16 counts and below, and market prices rose slightly.

Yesterday, the fabric market started flat and ended strong. Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 505 yuan. Local peers were slightly aggressive, but customer demand was very low. Later, upon hearing that the price of cotton yarn had risen, sentiment improved, and short positions were covered together. Holders insisted on not selling, and with the loose monetary situation, market prices showed vigor and prosperity. In the middle, the price reached a high of 540 yuan. Near the close, due to some selling by long holders, the price retreated slightly to close at 535 yuan, resulting in an increase of 30 yuan compared to the weekend. Medium-grade fine cloths such as Five Blessings, Trumpet, and Children also rose by around 30 yuan.

The sales of Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji were relatively narrow, and the market had ample supplies, so it only rose by 15 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong rose steadily from 515 yuan to close at 532 yuan, resulting in an increase of 7 yuan. The 190 Shilin factory price approached the 1,000 yuan mark. Printed Bi Ji also opened high at 560 yuan. In the afternoon, the trend of each fabric continued to be strong. It was heard that Longtou fine cloth was trading at 550 yuan.

### Joint Purchasing Office Decides to Increase Cotton Purchase Quantity

[Our Report] The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee held a routine meeting yesterday, chaired by Liu Gongyun. After discussion, two urgent proposals were passed: (1) Strengthen the purchase of domestic cotton and increase the purchase quantity. It is now decided to purchase 1 million dan before the end of this year, doubling the original target of 500,000 dan. To date, the amount of domestic cotton purchased has exceeded the 300,000 dan mark. (2) Domestic cotton in various regions should be purchased and transported as it is purchased, and it should be transported to the location of the yarn factories as soon as possible to ensure the safety of the raw materials and maintain the work of each factory.

It is reported that domestic cotton in various regions is currently entering the market in large quantities, and it can be purchased in large quantities as long as there is sufficient capital. On average, purchasing 15,000 to 16,000 dan per day is not a problem. When funds are sufficient, purchasing 20,000 dan per day is also not difficult. It is heard that in addition to the original capital of 600 million yuan, the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee will be provided with additional funds by the national banks as needed to supplement the raw cotton inventory.

### Tea Market Prices Rise Rapidly

Yesterday, the foreign tea market continued to move in a beautiful direction. The reason is that after the closure of customs in two days, exporters realized that the shipping schedule on the 25th of this month is approaching soon, so their willingness to act is more than in the past. The sellers insisted on the scarcity of production and inventory, and speculation became more rampant. Prices rose rapidly again, so the price increase, like bamboo shoots after rain, competed to grow rapidly. As for domestic sales of various grades, replenishment also occurred in the local market and elsewhere. The market atmosphere unanimously followed suit and rose.

Zhao is Wei's younger sister-in-law, in her early twenties, naturally beautiful, and deeply loved by Jinsheng. The 18th of this month was the auspicious day for the Ni and Zhao wedding. Ni, being financially comfortable, had already begun a large-scale banquet three days prior, inviting relatives and friends. The day itself was even more lively, with over a hundred tables of food and drink prepared. Unexpectedly, around 7 p.m., just as the wedding ceremony was taking place, two large red lanterns with the Ni surname and a potted plant symbolizing "A Thousand Years of Fortune" simultaneously went out and broke, astonishing all the guests. Suddenly, a fire broke out in the kitchen. At the time, all the cooks were in the hall watching the ceremony, in high spirits, so the fire spread rapidly. By the time it was discovered, it had already burst through the roof, making it impossible to extinguish. The hall immediately descended into chaos, with onlookers turning into firefighters. In the end, more than ten houses, including two halls, and five "longevity items" in the lumber yard's inner room were burned, resulting in considerable losses. What was even more ridiculous was that some onlookers took advantage of the fire to loot, stealing all of the bride's more than ten red and green new cotton quilts, leaving the bride and groom at a loss whether to laugh or cry. At the same time, Ding Muping, the daughter of the Yuanyuan Silver Shop in the city, who was a close friend of the bride and had been invited to the village to be a bridesmaid, had a strand of her hair singed by the fire, a close call.
