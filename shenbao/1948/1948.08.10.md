### Proceeds from the Sale of American Aid Materials to be Entirely Centralized at the Central Bank; Government Aims to Freeze Most Funds to Contract Currency

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The American Aid Utilization Committee held its second committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the 9th at the No. 1 Official Residence of the Executive Yuan. Those in attendance included Committee members Wang Shijie, Wang Yunwu, Yu Dawei, Yan Jiagan, as well as Deputy Secretary-General Wu Xuelan and others from the American Aid Utilization Committee. Li Gan, a member of the technical delegation who recently returned from the United States, also attended. The meeting was personally presided over by Weng Wenhao, who also serves as Chairman. The discussions lasted four hours, during which concrete decisions were made regarding the implementation of American aid and the establishment of a special account at the Central Bank. The discussion on whether to completely deposit the legal tender obtained from the sale of materials into the Central Bank was particularly detailed. The issue of whether to allow the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Municipal Bank to handle the transfer of American aid proceeds was also carefully considered. Ultimately, it was decided that all legal tender obtained from the sale of materials should be centralized at the Central Bank, which will handle the deposit business. If the Central Bank's institutions are insufficient, it may entrust other national banks to handle the transactions on its behalf, but the funds received must be immediately transferred to the Central Bank. If other national banks incur additional expenses as a result of handling these receipts, the Central Bank may provide subsidies. The technical aspects of implementation will be discussed and decided by the Central Bank and other national banks (please refer to another article and the Central Daily News editorial on the 9th). Regarding the establishment of a special account at the Central Bank as stipulated in Article 5 of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement, it was decided to establish two accounts. One is a special account, where the value of American aid materials plus freight, multiplied by the current exchange rate, will be calculated at the US dollar value and converted into the equivalent amount of Chinese currency to be deposited. This account will be used to offset future sales of American aid materials. The second is a sales revenue deposit account, where the funds obtained from the sale of American aid materials will be deposited. The use of these deposits will be determined by China and the United States in accordance with the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement. The Chinese side hopes to freeze most of the funds to contract currency, minimizing the amount of funds used. The amount to be frozen will be discussed by both China and the United States. Currently, both parties are studying this matter, and it will be presented for discussion and decision at the joint meeting on the 13th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Central Daily News editorial on the 9th criticized certain two national banks and one local bank for attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to undermine American aid, and was titled "They Are About to Defeat American Aid." The article pointed out that these banks were showing clear intentions regarding American aid proceeds, treating them as ordinary funds to be fought over. It also stated, "They are preventing the legal tender obtained from the sale of American aid materials from being returned, and immediately using it in the market, ultimately leading to the path of hoarding materials. If they are allowed to do this, they will have eight trillion legal tender circulating in their hands, then there will be eight trillion in floating capital haunting the market every day." The article concluded by proposing three principles that it hoped the Executive Yuan would adopt: (1) American aid proceeds must be directly deposited into the Central Bank; (2) National banks must not hoard American aid materials; (3) Institutions or individuals purchasing American aid materials must not obtain low-interest loans from national banks.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Since the Central Daily News editorial was published on the 9th, it has attracted widespread attention. According to sources related to American aid: The two national banks and one local bank referred to in the Central Daily News editorial are the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Municipal Bank. When the Shanghai Municipal Food Rationing Committee distributed food, the proceeds from the sales were handled by the above banks on behalf of the Central Bank. Three days later, the funds collected were transferred to the Central Bank. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Food Rationing Committee is distributing American aid food, and these three banks are still requesting to handle the transactions on behalf of the Central Bank according to past practice, and are requesting to remit the funds to the Central Bank after three days. However, the American Aid Committee decided on the 9th that if the Central Bank entrusts other national banks to handle the transactions on its behalf, the proceeds from the sales must be immediately transferred to the Central Bank.

### Yan Jiagan Reports on the Allocation and Quantities Arrived of American Aid Rice, Flour, and Cotton at the Utilization Committee Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] At the American Aid Utilization Committee meeting on the 9th, in addition to Li Gan reporting on the negotiation process of this American aid loan, Yan Jiagan provided a detailed report on the allocation of American aid materials and the quantities that have arrived in China. According to the report: As of August 5th, taking rice, flour, and cotton as examples, the detailed statistics are as follows: (1) Rice: The first batch ordered totaled 66,829 long tons, the second batch ordered totaled 21,692 long tons, for a total of 88,521 long tons, valued at $16,176,408. 53,629 long tons have arrived, 3,928 long tons are en route, 41,528 long tons have been allocated, and 12,107 long tons remain in storage. (2) Flour: The first batch ordered totaled 8,929 tons, the second batch ordered totaled 8,929 tons, for a total of 17,858 tons, valued at $2,679,920. 8,939 long tons have arrived, and 2,482 long tons are en route, but the flour has not yet been distributed. (3) Cotton: 70,378 bales have been ordered, valued at $12,959,369, and all have arrived. The total value of the ordered rice, flour, and cotton is $31,815,697. In addition to this, there are other orders that have not been included because the payment procedures have not been completed. Fertilizer and oil have been ordered, but have not been included due to unpaid payments. Regarding the use of rice, flour, and cotton, the rice has been included in the rationing program. In addition to the first batch of cotton that has been ordered and arrived, the second batch of $3,370 (thousands) approved by the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration is equivalent to 191,126 bales. Some have arrived, and some are en route. The plan is to exchange cotton for yarn, with one bale of cotton exchanging for 453 pounds of yarn, and then processing the yarn. The calculation method is being studied by the Cotton Subcommittee. Part of the exchanged cotton yarn will be exported to obtain foreign exchange to purchase more cotton, and part will be sold domestically to meet domestic needs. Of the allocated rice, the Shanghai Municipal Food Rationing Committee received the most, at 39,645 tons, followed by Guangzhou, at 1,883 tons, of which 700 tons were transferred from Guangzhou to Shantou. The rationing price is as close to the market price as possible, at 32 million legal tender per shi, but some impoverished people receive it at 20 million legal tender per shi. This American aid grain is only sufficient for a portion of the rationing needs, and China must raise its own grain sources. The Ministry of Food has recently established an Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee in Shanghai, headed by Yang Chuoan.

### Lapham Declares to Reporters That American Aid Has No Regional Bias; Situation in Northeast and North China Not as Serious as Rumored; Desires China to Implement Reform Plans

[News from this Paper] After a ten-day extensive and on-the-spot investigation in various parts of North and Northeast China, Mr. Lapham, Director of the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, answered reporters' questions at a press conference yesterday with a firm tone: "At this stage, the situation in the Northeast and North China is not as serious as rumored. The situation in the Northeast is even more advanced than it was before June. Generals Wei Lihuang and Fu Zuoyi and others are extremely dutiful, and the spirit of the general public to resist and defend the region is particularly high. This spirit is actually more important than weapons."

It is said that this trip left a particularly deep impression on the industrial opportunities for the future of the Northeast. North China is an important territory of China and also a central industrial area. From the observations made, the general public’s idea that the government will abandon the Northeast and North China after the situation becomes serious is incorrect. Generals Fu and Wei expressed their hope to increase military assistance during the talks, but this point has gone beyond the scope of the personal work I am responsible for. However, I firmly believe that the United States will make an extremely democratic decision on the distribution of military aid to China.

Mr. Lapham reiterated yesterday that the $400 million in American aid was all donated by American taxpayers. China does need American aid at present, but the United States needs to understand whether the aid has been properly used, and whether the planned projects can be gradually realized. I personally believe that China still needs to reform in many areas, such as the tax system. Therefore, I hope that by the coming winter, although we may not be able to see a comprehensive reform completed, there will at least be signs that reform has begun, so that Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman can list facts when reporting to Congress to illustrate how the Chinese government is using the aid to protect China’s independence and sovereignty. The General Administration has no obligation to spend all of the $275 million of aid to China. The nature of the funds is a loan rather than a gift. Therefore, unless the funds are used properly, the General Administration will suspend the use of the funds at any time. The legal tender obtained from the sale of American aid materials must also be used effectively after obtaining the consent of the General Administration. The method of using the funds is being researched.

Mr. Lapham stated that he does not intend to criticize the Chinese government, and this is not his responsibility. However, the Chinese government does not oppose various reforms, but various reform plans are currently stalled. Therefore, I hope to see some action. Although I do not wish to discuss Stillman’s report regarding the $275 million of American aid, I discussed the $60 million of dedicated construction funds and the $10 million of funding for supplementary equipment and parts with President Weng of the Executive Yuan two weeks ago. I believe that it can be increased by $10 million to allow factories in various places to supplement or repair their equipment. In short, American aid to assist China's industrial recovery is not limited to South China and Central China, but will extend to the entire country.

### President Truman Approves Arms Supply to Our Country; Bridges Accuses of Prolonged Delay

[United Press Washington, August 8] Senator Bridges announced on the 8th that President Truman has approved the transfer of arms to China under the $125 million military aid plan by the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters. In his letter to Mr. Du, he made it clear that this assistance does not mean that the United States is responsible for China's policies.

Bridges accused Truman of adopting a "deliberate" and "unforgivable" "stagnation and delay" policy, allowing the Soviet Union to extend its power in the Far East. Mr. Jie Bai is a Republican and the current chairman of the Appropriations Committee and a strong advocate of aiding President Chiang Kai-shek of China.

He claimed that, to date, only 9 million yuan—or one-fourteenth of the total—of the 125 million yuan in aid to China has been allocated.

In a letter from Truman to Bridges, he said, "I have ordered the Secretary of Defense to assist the Chinese government in obtaining the supply of these military supplies." He also said, "The outline of the aid to China plan submitted by General Yall of the Chief of the Army and General De Mai, Chief of the War Planning Department, will be given 'due consideration.'" Their opinions have been submitted to the Appropriations Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives. "Assistance under this plan cannot be interpreted as the United States being responsible for the policies, actions, or any circumstances that may occur at any time of the Chinese government."

Bridges pointed out that if China cannot obtain materials and military supplies from the U.S. Army, Navy, or other government agencies, it will be "very costly and inefficient" because China must send personnel to U.S. factories to obtain them.

Well-informed sources believe that Bridges' views foreshadow that the Republican Party will expand its aid to China plan if it wins the general election in November.

Bridges particularly accused Truman of "delaying the first delivery for four months after Congress passed the aid to China plan." He also said: Truman's measures are clearly in conflict with Congress, and his policy "cannot be described as a bipartisan policy in any language." Bridges concluded: "I hope that a new policy has begun in China, and I hope that the government's past policy of procrastination towards China will be declared terminated."

[Central News Agency Washington, August 8] Hoffman announced that the Agency has approved the purchase of $37 million worth of cotton to supply China.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] Changchun Mayor Shang Chuandao recently telegraphed the local authorities here and in the Northeast, requesting attention to the Changchun crisis and calling for rescue. Shang stated: Changchun is containing five columns and two divisions of Lin Biao's bandits. If Changchun is lost, Panjin will be equally endangered in three months, and North China will share the same fate as the Northeast. 360,000 people in Changchun are on the brink of death. He hopes that 20 planes will airdrop food every day to save the crisis.

Editorial

### Inflation and Currency Shortage

Over the past week, the four major banks and two bureaus have been issuing currency in large quantities, totaling over 17 trillion. This has led to an easing of credit and a drop in shadow interest rates. However, the market still feels a shortage of cash. When banks and financial institutions try to withdraw cash, anything over 300 million requires the acceptance of promissory notes, with the discount rising to about 10%. In Hankou, the currency shortage is even more severe. The Hubei Provincial Bank in Wuchang was unable to pay out cash, leading to two instances of destruction by depositors. Similar situations are occurring in other cities, which cannot be ignored as a paradoxical phenomenon in the current economic situation.

Since currency is inflating and credit is very loose, why is there a currency shortage? This may seem strange at first glance, but the reason is very simple. Because currency inflation has raised the general price level, it has also increased the need for currency. According to official sources, the rate of price increases far exceeds the multiple of currency issuance. Therefore, the more currency inflates, the less cash there is. This is the first reason.

The scope of currency is not limited to cash alone. Various types of negotiable instruments are substitutes for cash. In normal times, the acceptance and transfer of these substitutes reduces the use and pressure on cash and increases convenience and portability for the public. However, because currency is now inflating excessively, the authorities, to mitigate this inflation, deliberately reduce the use of these instruments, such as prohibiting same-day redemption and cracking down on the issuance of promissory notes. As the scope of substitutes shrinks, the amount of cash needed in the market inevitably increases. This is the second reason.

The circulation of funds between different financial centers originally relied solely on remittances. However, due to currency inflation and capital flight, more restrictions have been imposed to prevent this. As a result, many internal remittances have had to be replaced by transporting cash, further strengthening the need for cash. This is the third reason.

Because internal remittances cannot be naturally adjusted, a high exchange rate differential has arisen between the two regions. For example, remitting 10 million from Shanghai to Guangzhou only yields 5.5 million in Guangzhou. As a result, those with the means are finding ways to transport cash to Guangdong, and then remit from Guangdong to Shanghai, seeking to profit nearly 100% in a single transaction. Consequently, the cash in the local area is emptied by these transporters. This is the fourth reason.

Currency inflation has raised prices. To control prices, it is necessary to tighten currency and contract credit. The recent extreme shortage of cash and the rising discount rates may involve artificial manipulation to leave room for the issuance of larger denomination banknotes. This is the fifth reason.

Shanghai is the center of currency issuance. Whether printed abroad or domestically, all banknotes must be issued from the Central Bank here. Logically, Shanghai should not experience a currency shortage. However, due to the above-mentioned factors, this phenomenon has gradually spread from the inland to Shanghai. In addition to the alarming discounts, long lines for cash withdrawals, and unjustified discounts in payments are causing deep pain to the financial and industrial sectors. In particular, the general wage earners mostly receive promissory notes and checks as part of their salary, causing many inconveniences in their daily lives. These phenomena are too deeply related to the people's livelihood and have too great an impact on the entire market, and the authorities should not overlook them!

The authorities' plan to issue large denomination banknotes has been formally announced and partially implemented. Given the severity of the current currency shortage, the time for their introduction should be ripe. If new banknotes of 1 million and 5 million are introduced and circulate smoothly in the market, it is believed that the above-mentioned difficulties can be gradually resolved. Our concern is that the more currency in circulation, the higher the base price will inevitably be, and the more currency will be needed. If this process continues without fundamental change, the currency will become scarce again after a considerable period, and even larger denomination banknotes will become necessary. This vicious cycle will continue indefinitely. When will the currency shortage truly disappear? And how large will the final denomination banknote be?

In conclusion, if the government does not make a strong determination to balance revenue and expenditure quickly, and abandons the idea of ​​making up for deficits by issuing more currency, and if it does not find a way to make the Central Bank's issuing power subject to social supervision and declare it independent of the Ministry of Finance, then this vicious cycle will become increasingly intense and unstoppable.

### Assisting Our Reconstruction Efforts: Utilizing Japanese Industry, ECA Sends Personnel to Japan for Investigation

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th, United Press] A senior official of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) stated that the $275 million in economic aid to China can be used not only directly by China but also indirectly to restore Japanese trade. They absolutely deny any intention to suggest that Japan restore its pre-war industrial power status, but emphasize that China would benefit greatly if it could utilize Japanese industry in its reconstruction efforts. Apart from cotton, the industrial goods China needs can be sourced from the Far East and other places outside the United States. The ECA has quietly dispatched two people from its China mission to Japan for a preliminary investigation. It is reported that Japan will import coal (mostly Kailuan coal) and iron sand from China, and supply China with parts for industrial facilities built during the occupation, as well as parts and equipment for the Yuehan Railway. In the future, Japan will supply goods to China. It will be more economical to obtain goods from Japan than from the United States. The extent to which Japanese industry will assist China's construction depends on the Chinese projects selected by the members of the ECA's China Construction Survey Team. Informed sources say that the ECA is seriously considering supplying coal to Japan. Most of the iron supplied to Japan will be taken from the iron left by Japan near the Yangtze River. ECA officials said that this policy is the same as the work taken in Europe to promote East-West trade, and the policy will also be coordinated with the Allied plan to enable Japan to obtain US dollars to purchase US cotton.

### Zhou Yide Told Reporters That China and Japan Should Assist Each Other

[Another dispatch] Republican Congressman Zhou Yide said when interviewed by reporters, "Once China gets rid of its fears of communism and aggression, it will be willing to restore trade relations with Japan." Zhou's remarks were made after the ECA announced its hope to include part of the promotion of Japanese industry in China's reconstruction plan. He said, "The Chinese are very uneasy about the amount of American aid to their old enemy, Japan. They feel that we give more preferential treatment to the aggressors than to the allies, which is not without reason. However, the pre-war trade pattern is considered absolutely necessary for the prosperity of the entire East." He explained, "Japan cannot get rid of its relationship with China if it wants to maintain the livelihood of its people. At the same time, China needs a large number of cheap goods produced by Japan before the war. If we can help China defeat the communist army, end the civil war that is destroying its economy, and help it get rid of the fear of aggression, then China will definitely be able to restore its trade relations with Japan and other Far Eastern countries. Therefore, all efforts are not too late." He also said, "The success or failure of Japan's future depends on China's development. If China falls into the hands of the communists, it will be impossible for us to ask Japan not to empty the American treasury again." Zhou said: He believes that the level of Japanese industry should be slightly higher than before the war. Because the Japanese have increased and must engage in huge reconstruction work, the previously stipulated level of Japanese industry can only enable the Japanese people to maintain their survival. As for Japan's war potential, it is far easier to control than Germany's war potential. Because Japan lacks raw materials and is easily isolated, Zhou advocated strict control over the iron sand and steel put into Japan, so as to effectively control Japan's war potential. He also believes that the United States should stabilize the value of the yen itself without waiting for the consent of other countries. Zhou also said: It is not the right time to promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. There are too many things we need to deal with now. He believes that other countries have no desire to complete the peace treaty with Japan until the Berlin situation is resolved. Zhou Yide also said: China and Japan may face fierce wars in many industrial products in the future.

### Students from Bianzhong Yuan Industrial College Petitioning the Ministry of Education

Dispersed successively after persuasion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] More than 100 students from the private Zhongyuan Institute of Technology in Henan went to the Ministry of Education to petition on the 9th. It is reported that the college has not been established for a long time, and the school's board of directors has not been registered. The Ministry of Education has no case to check, and the students have no student status. However, when the college was trapped by the communists, the students fled to Nanjing for refuge. The Ministry of Education went to Nanjing to provide shelter and relief. Later, the Guidance Association sent them to Zhenjiang as a permanent residence, and provided daily relief funds so that the students could study and participate in the university transfer examination. The students suddenly came to Nanjing collectively from Zhenjiang, requesting the Ministry of Education to exempt them from the examination and assign them to ten universities. The Ministry of Education believed that the students' request violated the regulations, and the method of recommendation had long been abolished. Tang Peijing, the Director of the Ministry, and Tian Peilin, the Deputy Minister, received and guided them successively. After two rounds of persuasion by Guo Zhonggui, the vice chairman of the school's board of directors, they dispersed successively in the evening.

### Huang Wanju, Overseas Chinese Leader in Japan, Talks About the Recent Situation in Japan

Japanese People Regard Themselves as Anti-Communist Base

[Central News Agency, this city] Huang Wanju, a leader of overseas Chinese in Japan, returned to China from Japan and arrived in Shanghai. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing to meet the President and pay his respects, and report on the situation of overseas Chinese. Huang told reporters yesterday: There are currently 30,000 overseas Chinese in Japan. Their current situation is very different from that at the time of victory. At that time, the professions run by overseas Chinese sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, and they were all thriving. But so far, due to the discrimination and stricter control of the Japanese, people cannot help but feel that things have changed. He said: The progress of Japan's industrial recovery is very rapid, especially the textile and chemical industries. Japan's democratic reforms after the war have indeed made progress, but at present, the Japanese people regard themselves as an anti-communist base, and they are all eager to try and look forward to the outbreak of a world war as soon as possible. I am sincerely afraid that the development of this concept will make the democratic reforms completely abandoned and pose a threat to our country.

### Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Talks About the Undetermined Border between China and Myanmar Should be Handled Appropriately, We Have Absolutely No Extra Land Claims

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on the 9th: Since the Ministry of Interior's border survey team returned to Beijing, there has been much speculation about the undetermined border between China and Myanmar. The Associated Press's Nanjing dispatch on the 8th stated that China will make a land claim to Myanmar with an area of ​​more than 100,000 square kilometers, such as the size of Zhejiang, based on the results of the border demarcation study. This is especially absurd. China and Myanmar should have appropriate and reasonable handling of the undetermined border in order to maintain their common interests. However, China has absolutely no claim for any additional land. Our government has repeatedly expressed this attitude clearly, and it is well known to our neighbor, Myanmar. Therefore, there is no need to refute any rumors. However, he pointed out that the Associated Press's report has damaged the traditional friendship between China and Myanmar, and therefore made the above explanation.

### Complex Issue of Circulating Vouchers: Wei Lihuang Cables Beiping Requesting Opening of Exchange Remittance Queue Number Restrictions; It is Reported That Zuo Yifu Replied by Cable Proposing Solutions

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The issue of circulating vouchers has developed into an economic deadlock between North China and Northeast China. The Northeast Suppression Headquarters cabled Beiping, requesting the North China Suppression Headquarters to open the queue number restrictions to ease the intense emotions of the people in Northeast China before "August 19th". It is reported that Zuo Yifu replied to Wei Lihuang by cable last night, proposing solutions. The details are unknown. According to senior officials familiar with this issue, the method of restricting queue numbers for remittances between 200 million and 23 million has had little effect, because most of the remitters have broken up large amounts into smaller amounts, or consolidated smaller amounts into larger amounts for remittance. Large amounts can be approved through various methods.

Another important deadlock is that too many idle employees of the central government in various institutions in the Northeast are staying in Beiping and Tianjin, which has changed the nature of the so-called resettlement fee. These "suspended-from-duty-but-still-receiving-salary" personnel receive more than 2 billion legal currency per month, based on the fourth-level of entrusted appointments. The resettlement fee remitted to Beiping and Tianjin by the Northeast Transportation Agency in June alone reached more than half of its total personnel expenses of over 400 billion circulating vouchers. Currently, various parties are studying how to rationalize the treatment of those who are idle in Beiping and Tianjin, and pay them according to the Beiping and Tianjin civil servant standards, directly issuing legal currency in Beiping and Tianjin.

### American, British, and French Envoys Receive New Instructions - Visit Molotov for the Third Time - Discuss the Overall Situation in Germany to Prevent the Deterioration of the Situation

[Our Dispatch] London Radio Broadcast, Moscow, 9th - The special envoys of the United States, Britain, and France visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov again at 5 p.m. this afternoon (2 p.m. standard time) to discuss the overall situation in Germany. This is the third meeting between the American, British, and French diplomats and Molotov. The details of the meeting remain strictly confidential.

[Our Dispatch] London Radio Broadcast, 9th - Although a glimmer of hope has appeared for the reconvening of the four-power conference, some influential figures in the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are pessimistic that the East and West will ultimately fail to reach an agreement on the German question. At most, they hope for a buffer plan that can prevent the overall situation from deteriorating to the point of causing a world war. This pessimism is based on the following facts: (1) The Western powers will never voluntarily abandon Germany and allow it to become another satellite state of the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union, fearing that a unified Germany may join the West against the East, is also unwilling to abandon eastern Germany. (3) Germany, caught between the struggle between the two great powers of East and West, has no third way out except to continue to remain divided. In fact, what the East and West are arguing about is nothing more than controlling the whole of Germany.

[United Press London, 8th] Diplomatic circles stated on the 8th that the Soviet Union fears that the four-power foreign ministers' conference may reveal obvious cracks behind the scenes, and this concern may be the reason for the current slow pace of East-West negotiations in Moscow. It is reported that US Ambassador Smith, French Ambassador Chataigneau, and British Special Envoy Roberts have received new instructions from their respective governments. Everything about the Moscow negotiations is of a speculative nature, but it is generally believed that the Soviet Union may intend to relax the agenda of the foreign ministers' conference to discuss issues that the Soviet Union is willing to discuss, while also excluding any issues that may make the Soviet Union embarrassed and uneasy. The so-called embarrassing and uneasy issues include the treaty to restore Austria's independence, the issue of Trieste's return to Italy, and the future territorial issues of Germany and Poland. It is said that if the future issue of Trieste and the issue of restoring Austria's independence are discussed, the increasingly serious split between the Communist Information Bureau and Yugoslav Marshal Tito will clearly become a factor. At the same time, in any decision on the broader German question, the Soviet Union, on the one hand, has a desire to win Germany's friendship, and on the other hand, needs to allow Poland's demand to make the current temporary border between Germany and Poland a permanent border. The Western allies have suggested that Trieste be returned to Italy, but Tito opposes this move. If the Soviet Union agrees to this, the Italian Communist bloc will be greatly strengthened. As for the Austrian question, Tito has demanded compensation from Austria. The Soviet Union may believe that supporting Austria is beneficial to it, but doing so would further exacerbate the conflict between Tito and the Communist Information Bureau.

### The Soviet Union Launches a New Cold War - Accuses American and British Aircraft of Violating Aviation Regulations - Police in the Western District of Berlin Suddenly Arrested

The Soviet side does not recognize Markgraf's dismissal, and Markgraf is now the police chief of the Soviet District. The arrested police officers are members of Sturm's staff because they still live in the Soviet District due to the housing shortage.

### American Occupation Forces in South Korea to Remain Indefinitely

American Newspapers' Views on the Situation in South Korea

[United States Information Service New York, 8th] When American newspapers published the news that Korean President Syngman Rhee planned to establish a US-Korea Joint Committee to arrange for the withdrawal of troops, they stated that the American military occupation of South Korea would continue indefinitely. The New York Times pointed out that the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on the Korean question stipulates that within 30 days after the establishment of the Korean National Government, the US and Soviet armies must simultaneously withdraw from their respective occupied areas. Rhee's government, the result of the election held in South Korea on May 10 under the supervision of UN observers, will formally assume sovereignty over Korea on August 15 (the anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese rule). However, the Soviet military occupation authorities in North Korea have refused to recognize the regime led by Syngman Rhee. When proposing the establishment of the US-Korea Joint Committee, Rhee told the Korean National Assembly: "We feel that the liberation of Korea has not yet been completed, and therefore, we are willing for the American army to remain here as liberation forces." Rhee said that his government will treat the North Korean Communist election as "rebellious activities and will be punished." He said he would request the American army to remain until his government has the ability to defend itself and resist possible attacks from North Korea and South Korean Communists.

### French Government Decides to Implement New Financial Plan - Reynaud Threatens to Resign to Fight For It

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 8th] French Finance Minister Reynaud stated in the National Assembly this afternoon that if the parliament refuses to grant him the power to reform the tax code, he intends to resign and will not be thanked. In his speech, Reynaud stressed that economic recovery must be sought now to avoid a dramatic situation when the Marshall Aid Plan ends in 1952.

He said that even with American aid, it can only meet two-thirds of the country's needs. In 1949, the government will still need to find another 500 billion francs to compensate for the losses of the war and 600 billion francs to make up for the lack of a budget. If we do not act quickly, production will inevitably collapse when American aid ends. Reynaud then denied any intention to implement the ukase system, saying that a violent coup is easy to implement for economic recovery. Reynaud then briefly outlined his plan, which will (1) focus on increasing exports to the US dollar gold zone; (2) increase production; (3) reduce national expenses; (4) seek to make state-owned industries profitable; (5) increase tax revenue by reforming the tax system. Reynaud also announced in vague terms that he would raise new debts, but no firm decision has yet been made on this matter.

### The Behind-the-Scenes Life of Little Stalin (1)

Translated by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper

(Originally published in the August 17 issue of the American "Observer Magazine")

Stalin's private life is surrounded by an iron curtain. He has three children, two of whom—Yakov and Svetlana—are similarly protected by the dictator and kept secret from the outside world. But his 28-year-old child, Vasily, is fond of showing off, indulging in luxurious living and public scandals, which is the most taboo behavior of the Communist Party.

Vasily Stalin is a pampered, arrogant brat. His behavior is not like that of the son of a professional proletarian, but rather like that of a luxurious prince. Soviet newspapers sometimes portray him as a brave and martial air force hero in an attempt to conceal his mischievous behavior. But in the eyes of the friends he betrayed, the women he seduced, and the people he detained during drinking and revelry, he is certainly not a hero.

Wishing Newborns to Dance All Night

Young Vasily Stalin was born in 1920 to his father's second wife—the young and beautiful Aliluyeva. At that time, she had just graduated from college and was 21 years younger than her husband. At the naming ceremony feast, Stalin followed his relatives and friends in drinking and dancing wildly, without showing any signs of fatigue. Later, according to his friend, the journalist Radek, he became so emotional that he drew his pistol and fired it out the window. But time flies, and within a few years, his love for his son gradually cooled. The child disliked books, performed poorly in school, and often played pranks, making his teachers laugh and cry, and unable to do anything about it, because they dared not punish the child of the national hero. Vasily went to school by car every day, sitting behind his desk fidgeting, waiting for the moment when school was over, when he could hide in the car again—his favorite thing.

Stalin originally hoped that his son would be able to inherit his mantle, or at least become a government official. Now, seeing all this, his hopes have been dashed. So when Vasily suddenly became interested in flying, he was overjoyed. After graduating from school in 1939, his father allowed him to embark on the dangerous career of a pilot. Vasily has now grown into a slender, medium-sized young man with thick hair, closely resembling many photos of his father. The nose, low forehead, and thick hair are all like his father. He still ignored theory at aviation school, boldly performing various dangerous aerial maneuvers.

In 1941, he graduated from aviation school, received the rank of air force lieutenant, and was assigned to serve in a fighter unit on the northern front. Now the whole world seemed to be unfolding before him, and he immediately felt the taste of success, career, and power. He saw that his superiors were unwilling to send him to perform combat missions, apparently fearing that he would hurt his father's heart if something happened to him, so he asked to be assigned to the position of commander. He was assigned to lead a squadron of 18 fighter planes (with an expert serving as his assistant). From then on, his position gradually increased.

Showing Off and Abusing Power

At the same time, from that time on, this young commander gradually imitated his father in putting on the airs of a petty dictator. Regardless of the level of their position, he often scolded older air force officers for trivial matters, issued decrees to punish them, arbitrarily arrested people, and shouted loudly, using the intimidating tone used by senior commanders: "Do you want to go to Siberia?" But the actual combat operations were directed by the respectful assistant, who patiently listened to his superior's orders and then took the necessary measures according to his own ideas. But Vasily's superiors, in order to please the great dictator, still promoted and paid the young officer and awarded him various medals.

By 1944, he had already pinned the rank of colonel on his shoulders. Nine months later, Air Force Marshal Novikov submitted an order to Stalin for him to sign, appointing his son as a general. Vasily had not yet turned 24. But his father did not sign the order. He was determined to make his ambitious son abandon evil and return to righteousness, and at the same time teach a lesson to those officers who indulge his son with excessive flattery.

### Price Control Plan Not Adopted - Truman to Issue Statement - Remains Silent on Senators' Impeachment Threat

[Central News Agency Washington, 8th United Press] The deeply contentious members of the 80th US Congress have returned home. Truman is said to have drafted a statement criticizing their disapproval of his legislative agenda. The 13-day special session of Congress adjourned on the evening of the 7th after passing moderate anti-inflation and housing bills amid the most politically contentious climax in recent years. Demands for wage and price controls and rationing powers were not passed.

Authoritative executive authorities say Truman will reluctantly sign the Republican price and housing bill and will issue a statement early this week attacking the bill as being untimely. It is not yet known whether the President will personally respond to or have other Democrats respond to Senator Ferguson's threat to impeach the President. Speculation is that Truman will remain silent. Ferguson condemned the President in the Senate for refusing to give Congress access to federal civil servant files, placing legislators in an intolerable situation because they will blindly legislate or force Truman to respond to his actions.

### Mussolini's Wife and Daughters - Appear in Person

Decide to Participate in American Mussolini Movie

[United Press Naples, 9th] Mussolini's son, Romano Mussolini, denied on the 9th Italian newspaper reports that he, his mother Donna Rachele, and his sister Anna Maria will participate in a film produced by an American film company about the life of Mussolini. Rome's pro-Communist Republic Daily said that Donna Rachele had already accepted the invitation to appear in the film. The only member of the Mussolini family who refused the invitation was Mussolini's daughter, Ida, the wife of former Fascist Foreign Minister Ciano. Ciano, the newspaper also said, The role of Mussolini's last mistress, Claretta Petacci, will be played by her sister, who "apparently rushed back from Spain to participate in the performance," because Petacci herself was executed along with Mussolini.

### Nagasaki Bells Ring Out - Mourning the Ghosts of the Holocaust

40,000 People Died in the Atomic Bombing Three Years Ago

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 9th] This morning, churches and temples in Nagasaki rang their bells to mourn the ghosts of the 40,000 citizens who lost their lives to the atomic bomb on this day three years ago.

### A Soviet Teacher Unwilling to Leave the US - Suddenly Requests Federal Bureau Protection - American Spies Already Directly Involved with Soviet Consulate

[Central News Agency New York, 9th] One of the three Soviet teachers who suddenly "disappeared" on the eve of their return to the Soviet Union, Sangmarin, has now approached the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this country, requesting protection. Sang, his wife (also a teacher at a Soviet Overseas Children's School), and their three children reportedly disappeared on July 31 as they were preparing to board a ship to return to the Soviet Union. Another theory is that they did not want to be repatriated and were hiding in a White Russian home. Sang's surrender to the Federal Bureau of Investigation coincided with the "rescue" of Sang's colleague, Mrs. Goronkina, 7th, by Soviet consular officials. Mrs. Gao, 52, was supposed to return home on the same ship as Sang. According to the Soviet Consul General, Mrs. Gao was drugged and abducted by a White Russian, and was later rescued from a White Russian farm by him and his assistants. It appears that Soviet citizens and White Russians here have been fighting for some time over the unwillingness of Soviet overseas Chinese to be recalled, and this intense competition has become increasingly important. It is reported that the House Committee to Investigate Actions Against US Interests will request that the State Department decide whether members of the committee may enter the Soviet consulate, question Mrs. Gao, or request that Sang appear before the committee to answer questions about the spy case.

### The US Expands its Air Force Strength - The B50 Bomber is Incredibly Powerful

[United Press Washington, 8th] The US Air Force is rapidly expanding its B29 Superfortress reserves to the front line to repel enemy attacks on the United States. Eight heavy bomber squadrons capable of carrying giant bombs have been organized within the United States, with five more overseas, and one in Alaska. Each heavy bomber squadron has 30 aircraft. The bomber squadrons overseas include three stationed in the UK, one in Guam, and one in Germany, but the one in Germany will return home. The United States has a total of 13 heavy bomber squadrons, 390 heavy bombers that can attack any region of the world within hours of notification. The US Air Force plans to expand its medium and heavy bomber squadrons to 21 by July next year. Four to six squadrons will be B29 Superfortresses, and these aircraft are now medium bombers, because the B36 bomber has six engines and a range of 10,000 miles, twice that of the former. Two to four squadrons are composed of B36s and newer B50s. The B50 is an expansion of the B36, with increased range and payload.

### Zhudi and Ban Town Still Under Provincial Jurisdiction - Ministry of the Interior Believes Further Changes Will Increase Disputes - Can Reapply for Redesignation When Development Needs Arise in the Future

The City Council previously resolved in the Sixth General Assembly to send a letter to the City Government requesting that the Central Government re-determine the jurisdictional affiliation of Zhudi and Ban Town, which were mistakenly designated as provincial, and temporarily not transfer the part of the town under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. It is now learned that the City Government recently received a telegraphed reply from the Ministry of the Interior, stating that the new boundary lines of all provinces and cities were submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government for record-keeping. Further changes will increase disputes. Moreover, the division of urban areas should be based on actual needs. In the future, when agriculture, industry, and other sectors in each area have developed to a considerable extent, they can be changed at any time. For now, the original plan should be maintained. After discussion at the municipal meeting, it was decided to follow the original plan decided by the Executive Yuan, and reapply for changes when the city's municipal administration and agriculture and industry need development in the future. According to reports, the new provincial and municipal boundary lines were drafted by the Ministry of the Interior after convening a provincial and municipal boundary demarcation conference last year, using Panlong Port, Xiaolai Port, and Zhu Port as the new provincial and municipal boundary between Shanghai and Zhejiang, forming a natural straight line between the three ports.

According to news from the shipping industry: the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangning express ship, carrying more than 300 passengers, sailed from Shanghai to Nanjing on the morning of the 8th, and then to Hankou.

The ship's captain and the manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Nanjing branch decided not to sail due to responsibility concerns. It is reported that these passengers who rushed to seize seats without tickets are all independent peddlers. The Nanjing branch of the company is currently requesting the Nanjing city public security authorities to find a way to deal with the situation.

### New Industrial Utility Prices: Impacting Factory Costs, General Labor Union Appeals to Maintain Original Prices Temporarily, Sends Telegram to Council Requesting Special Meeting

The municipal General Labor Union believes that the threefold increase in utility prices will stimulate general price increases and directly impact factory costs. Given the current industrial depression and the weak purchasing power of the general public, sales of factory products have already sharply declined. If costs increase further, it will be even more difficult to sustain operations, inevitably leading to factory closures and resulting in a serious unemployment problem. A meeting was convened yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. during the 50th Standing Council meeting of the General Labor Union to discuss countermeasures. It was resolved to petition the municipal government, explaining that the utility price increases are unreasonable, and that adjustments should consider the burden on citizens and factories. A request will be submitted to the central government to restore subsidies. A telegram will also be sent to the council requesting a special meeting to discuss this issue. Prior to the convocation of the special meeting, the original prices should be maintained to alleviate the hardship of the people.

### Responsible Parties from Zhabei Electricity and Other Companies Describe the Difficult Situation Faced by Each Company

Regarding the water and electricity price issue for August, reporters visited responsible parties from Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, China Merchants Electrical Company, Pudong Electrical Company, Mainland Water Company, and other companies, summarizing their comments as follows: Public utilities take serving citizens as their premise. Restricted by legal regulations, excessive profits are impossible. Now that the country and society's economy has reached a dead end, each company cannot entertain extravagant hopes. Merely seeking that income is sufficient for reinvestment is already an achievement. However, each time water and electricity prices are adjusted, they are repeatedly reduced by the Public Utilities Bureau, resulting in huge losses and deep debts. The situation has worsened since June. The reasons for each company's difficulties are analyzed as follows: 1. The cost of living has increased dramatically since June. 2. Changes in exchange settlement methods have caused prices to rise linearly. 3. Fuel prices have risen sharply month by month. 4. Water and electricity are paid for after use. The prices announced at the beginning of the month can only be gradually collected around the beginning of the following month. The actual value of the currency is sometimes only 20-30% of the value at the time of the adjustment. Due to the above reasons, each company faces a shortage of funds and cannot make ends meet. In the past, the difference was small, and government loans could be used to supplement it. Recently, the amount of the shortage has become increasingly large, and loans are all over hundreds of billions of yuan, with no continuous supply possible. It is estimated that the shortfall in income and expenditure of each company in July is: Zhabei Water and Electricity Company: 425.6 billion yuan. China Merchants Electrical Company: 124.5 billion yuan. Pudong Electrical Company: 166 billion yuan. Mainland Water Company: 15.04 billion yuan. All dividends, depreciation, etc. have not yet been included, and it is really impossible to maintain reinvestment next month. As for the prices announced for August, they are still insufficient based on the actual situation. For example, Shanghai Electric Power Company, which supplies the largest amount of electricity in the city, is estimated to have a shortfall of more than 2 trillion yuan even if it charges according to the August approved electricity price. The estimated shortfall in income and expenditure of each China Merchants Company is as follows: 1. Zhabei Water and Electricity Company: a shortfall of more than 1 trillion yuan. 2. China Merchants Electrical Company: a shortfall of 203.2 billion yuan. 3. Pudong Electrical Company: a shortfall of 346 billion yuan. 4. Mainland Water Company: a shortfall of 220 billion yuan. Currently, each company is unable to purchase necessary equipment, and reduced efficiency will be unavoidable in the future. If the approved water and electricity prices for August are changed again, the operation will be even more difficult. As a result, the amount of water production and power generation of each company will depend solely on the amount of income. Maintaining the length of the supply may be impossible to continue. The countless consequences are unbearable to imagine.

### Nanchang Water and Electricity Prices: Five Times Higher Than Shanghai

Mayor Says Shanghai Is Still Cheaper

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday that the municipal government really cannot control the soaring prices of public utilities. The authorities certainly take into account the burden on citizens as a prerequisite, but they also have to consider the cost of public utilities in order to maintain operations. According to Mayor Wu, public utility prices in Nanchang are already five times higher than in Shanghai, but the people do not complain because the public utility company in Nanchang was forced to shut down electricity and water services due to its inability to maintain operations, causing the people unbearable hardship. They were forced to pay high prices to allow it to continue supplying services. In fact, the cost of Shanghai Electric Power Company in this city is indeed the lowest in the country. The reporter told him that some senior employees of the company are paid in US dollars, which has caused much criticism from the citizens. Mayor Wu said: The municipal government has also raised this issue with the company, and the company has agreed to gradually reduce it.

### Eternal Underwear Factory Electrocution Tragedy: Another Seven People Die, Factory Owner and Wife Perish Together, Underwear Industry Forms Aftermath Handling Committee

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the lightning strike, electrical leakage, and fire tragedy at the Yongbei Underwear Manufacturing Factory on Baoshan Road, another seven people have died from their injuries as of last night, bringing the total number of deaths to 63, including previous fatalities. Factory owner Cai Hongsheng, his wife, and his sister-in-law Ye Dai were all found dead one after another in the early morning of yesterday. After being sent to the morgue for examination, they were sent to the Dazhong Funeral Home for funeral arrangements. Among the workers, four seriously injured workers died yesterday, including Xie Zukang, Wang Baofeng, Gu Fufu, and Xue Fugen. They were also sent to the morgue for examination. Currently, the seriously injured workers receiving treatment in the hospital include Mao Chugan at the Sino-American Hospital, Dai Gengsheng and Ma Gongqing at the Municipal Fifth Hospital, Shen Shengquan and Zhang Fulin at the Fourth Hospital, and Xie Genyao and Hu Hao at the Gongji Hospital.

Fire Insurance Compensation Still Under Study

It is reported that factory owner Cai Hongsheng, from Hangzhou, was 38 years old and had been in the shirt business for more than ten years. He came from a poor background, gradually accumulated capital from apprenticeship, rented a mezzanine for small-scale operations, and expanded year by year due to his good interpersonal relationships, finally achieving today's success. Unexpectedly, a natural disaster struck, causing this catastrophe, and he and his wife and others died together, which made everyone who heard the news sigh! Fortunately, his son, Gengsheng, who is twelve years old, suffered only minor injuries and is not in serious danger. Cai's mother, who is over eighty years old, lives in the old house in Hangzhou, and no one has been notified yet. It is heard that the factory had fire insurance worth 48.3 billion with Anping, Xinhua, and Taihuosheng insurance companies. However, the current value of assets in the factory, including 1,000 bolts of poplin, finished shirts, and various raw materials, is estimated to be worth more than 100 billion. Therefore, how to compensate is still under study.

General Labor Union Expresses Sympathy and Investigates Responsibility

Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., the Shanghai Shirt Industry Association held an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors at the Xinya Restaurant to discuss the tragedy at the factory. It was decided to form an Aftermath Handling Committee for the Yongbei Factory Fire, and five people, including Chuan Liangjun, Chen Bao, Wang , Chen Hanquan, and Zhu Lin, were appointed to be responsible. A funeral arrangement team for the factory owner and workers and a cleanup assistance team were established. All directors and supervisors immediately paid 20 billion yuan in legal tender for funeral and other expenses. In addition, Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the General Labor Union, visited the factory and various hospitals yesterday morning to express condolences to the injured workers and the families of the deceased. Ye Xianggao, executive director of the association, assisted in taking care of clothing, coffins, and funeral arrangements. However, the workers died unnaturally. In addition to expressing deep condolences, the responsibility for the accident will be investigated, and accusations will be filed. According to the Factory Law, the factory's safety equipment was crude. The municipal government is requested to investigate responsibility, and it has been decided that: (1) The General Labor Union will send personnel to participate in the Yongbei Underwear Factory Fire Support Association. (2) Personnel will be sent to express condolences to the injured workers and the families of the deceased. (3) Fundraising will be launched to provide pensions to the families of the deceased.

### Sharp Rise in Utility Prices and Rice Prices: Expect Significant Increase in Index for the First Half of the Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] The prices of rice and public utilities for this month have increased very sharply. It is generally expected that the cost of living index for the first half of the month will also jump to an unprecedented level. The reporter asked Mayor Wu yesterday, and Wu also believed that the increase in the cost of living index was inevitable, especially since the compilation of the workers' index primarily uses rice and public utilities. According to Mayor Wu's estimate, the increase will be very significant.

### More Than One Hundred Bicycles Stolen and Transported for Sale Cracked

[Report from Our Newspaper] Feng, the head of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, in view of the increasing number of bicycle theft cases recently, ordered Li Yinmin, the head of the Criminal Investigation Section, to investigate and crack down.

### Two Fraud Cases Discovered by the Foreign Exchange Control Commission: Methods Used Are Exactly the Same, Impersonation Used to Defraud Two Foreign Exchange Payments, Chen Yongji, Zhang Hongming, and Others Prosecuted

[Report from Our Newspaper] On November 2 of last year, Chen Yongji, intending to defraud foreign exchange, falsely claimed to be the person in charge of Jinhua Wujiang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and forged and affixed the seal of the Jinhua County Chamber of Commerce, and applied to the Import and Export Control Commission to participate in the quota allocation for the third quarter of last year. The Import and Export Control Commission did not investigate in detail and allocated foreign exchange quota of 29,311 Hong Kong dollars. In addition, Zhang Hongming and Wang Linggui also falsely claimed to be the persons in charge of Jiande County Mingxin Dyeing Factory on October 27 of last year, forged and affixed the seal of the Jiande County Chamber of Commerce, and had the defendant Zhu Haowen sign to certify the application, defrauding the Import and Export Control Commission of 2,495 US dollars in foreign exchange. The Import and Export Control Commission discovered the matter afterwards and sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate. They have now been prosecuted for fraud and other crimes.

### Zhao Huijue Issues Statement: No Introductions of Personnel for Concurrent Jobs, Overdue Fees Not Passed on to Users, Street Light Fees Paid in Full Every Month

After the new utility prices for this month were announced, there were different views from various parties. Some people questioned the situation, and some involved private individuals. Zhao Huijue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, specially issued a statement yesterday to explain the situation. He stated that: (1) Regarding the statement in "a certain newspaper that important technical personnel of the Public Utilities Bureau are all working concurrently in foreign companies through the director's connections," since I took office, I have never introduced any employee to foreign or Chinese public utility companies, and none of the personnel in this bureau are working concurrently in foreign companies. (2) Regarding the point that "the 'overdue fees' listed in the report of the Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Council have become 'bad debts' and are passed on to the users," the 'overdue fees' listed on the accounts of each company are actually different from 'bad debts'. The company must wait for a considerable period of time for 'overdue fees' to be considered 'bad debts', such as when the defaulting user moves or closes down and cannot be collected, before they are included in 'bad debts' in order to be calculated. This bureau does not include 'overdue fees' when calculating prices. Regarding the "300 million yuan in electricity fees owed by the Public Utilities Bureau to the French Concession Electric Company from March to May" listed in the report, this is the street light electricity fee for the Old French Concession area. According to the regulations, the monthly street light electricity fees to be paid by the municipal government are paid to the company by this bureau after summarizing the information and requesting the municipal government to allocate funds and transfer them to the company. The overdue street light electricity fees mentioned in the report were allocated on May 17 for March, June 8 for April, and July 27 for May. This bureau paid the company immediately after the municipal government allocated the funds and there were no delays.

Each Company Says Concurrent Jobs Are Unfounded

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the rumors that some senior officials of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau are concurrently holding positions in various foreign public utility companies and receiving high salaries, spokespersons from major public utility companies stated yesterday that these rumors began to spread last week, but there is no factual basis.

### Rationed Household Sugar: Strictly Prevent Malpractice

### Australian New-Type Giant Vessel: Maiden Voyage Arrives in Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Australian merchant West Australian Steam Navigation Company's newly built new-type giant vessels "AROSKK" and "BELOS", each with a gross tonnage of 5,742 tons, a net tonnage of 4,362 tons, a hull length of 407 feet, a width of 55 feet, a draft of 23 feet, a speed (fully loaded) of 15.5 knots, passenger capacity of twelve people, and cargo capacity of 9,200 cubic feet, are equipped with air-conditioning and operate on the Sino-Australian South Seas route.

### Silver Coins Reappear: The Old North Gate Flourishes, "Scalpers" Are Most Active in the Morning

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] As a result of malignant inflation, it is well known that gold and US dollars are sought after for possession by the public. Next in line, silver coins, which have been in the cold palace for more than a decade, have also reappeared in the prosperous world.

Although the government has explicitly prohibited silver dollar trading, the existence of the silver dollar market is a well-known fact, just as the black market for gold banknotes can never be eradicated. In Nanjing, it is said that silver dollar trading has become an open activity. Shanghai is the financial center of the country, and the authorities enforce the law more strictly. The silver dollar market appears in a semi-open form, colloquially known as "opening one eye and closing the other," as if it were similar.

The history of the silver coin market in this city is about half a year. According to insiders, the origin is that many transactions in the Hankou area at that time used silver dollars as the unit, and the demand for silver coins was very high. Some independent peddlers came to Shanghai to search for purchases. They contacted the vendors who set up stalls selling silverware in the Old North Gate area, reselling and selling them, and thus a group of "scalpers" in the capacity of merchants emerged. They bought and sold, profiting from the difference. The transactions took place on the road, and slowly everyone near and far knew about it, and it became a market.

Waiting for Customers on the Sidewalk

In addition to Henan Road at the Old North Gate, which is the main base of the silver dollar market, there are sometimes "scalpers" "pioneering" between Henan Road, Tianjin Road, and Ningbo Road, as well as near Xinghualou on Fourth Avenue, but that is only a minority. It is estimated that there are hundreds of "scalpers" engaged in this business. They stand in groups of three or five on the sidewalk waiting for customers from 7:00 in the morning until 7:00 in the evening. They mostly carry only a small amount of silver coins and legal tender with them. The large batch of goods is carefully stored in nearby residences to avoid being confiscated. After agreeing on the quantity and price with the customer, they ask the customer to wait, and then immediately go home to fetch the silver coins or banknotes for exchange. The exchange location is within a few alleys to avoid the eyes and ears of the police.

Scam and Escape from Upstairs in a Brothel

However, there are generally few police patrols before 9:00 a.m. and after 5:00 p.m. At this time, they will trade openly on the road. The busiest time of the day is around 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning. Like the current hot weather, the period from 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. is the quietest. If there is a large amount of buying and selling that is inconvenient to exchange on the road or in the alley, the customer can ask them to be sent to a designated location, or follow them to the storage location for transactions. However, in the latter case, customers must be "old hands," otherwise there is a risk of being cheated or robbed. A few days ago, a customer from another location was brought upstairs to a brothel by two "scalpers," who took the legal tender and pretended to go downstairs to pick up the goods, but the two disappeared one after another.

Hong Kong Has People Who Specialize in Collecting Yuan Heads

The silver coins that are bought and sold are divided into "Big Heads," "Small Heads," "Dragon Dollars," and "Eagle Dollars." "Big Head" is also known as "Yuan Head," which is a silver dollar with a portrait of Yuan Shikai. "Small Head" is also known as "Sun Head," which is a silver dollar with a portrait of President Sun. The price of "Big Head" is slightly higher than that of "Small Head." It is said that some people in Hong Kong specialize in collecting silver dollars and specify that they must have Yuan Shikai's head, so the "Yuan Head" is more valuable than the "Sun Head." In addition to these two, there are also "Dragon Dollars" and "Eagle Dollars," but because the number in circulation is very small, they have become unpopular items, and the price is discounted by 20-30% regardless of whether they are sold.

Searching for Hoarded Coins Along Two Routes

Needless to say, the source of silver dollars is the hoarding by the people. Some "scalpers" are specifically responsible for buying them in the cities along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou routes. Although the profit they get from each silver dollar is only one or two hundred thousand yuan, if they have dozens of transactions on average every day, their income is indeed substantial. Today, in addition to independent peddlers and "scalpers," there are also many ordinary citizens with limited income who have a slight surplus in the silver coin market. In order to preserve the value of their currency, they buy ten or twenty coins at a time and sell them one by one when they need money.

### Retired Worker Extorts Money, Organizes Gang to Beat Up Towel Factory Owner

[Our Newspaper] Yuan Hanwei (26 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 42, Niuqiao Lane, West Fahua), a worker at Shuncheng Towel Factory on Anyuan Road, resigned last June.

### Young Offender Makes False Statements

### After Exhaustive Questioning Day and Night, Source of Typewriter Revealed

[Our Newspaper] Wu Shen, an engineer at the International Hotel, reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Precinct on June 21st that a typewriter had been stolen and requested an investigation. Chief Du of the precinct assigned the Judicial Section to investigate. Section Chief Yu dispatched police officers Huang Jiaqi and Gao Shaoshan, who discovered a similar typewriter at the Wu Tianxing Used Goods Store on Carter Road. The manager, Cheng Bingkai, said that a man named Xia Jing, claiming to be a reporter, had sold it for 60 million yuan. On the 27th, Cheng encountered Xia Jing on the road and turned him over to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Xia, who claimed to be 25 years old, from Nanchang, residing at No. 8, Jiyang Road, Qingdao, and employed by the Qingdao Minbao Newspaper, said he had arrived in Shanghai on June 3rd and brought two typewriters from Qingdao. One was sold to Wu Tianxing, and the other to Wenji Typewriter Shop on Jiangxi Road, for a total of 105 million yuan. The two machines belonged to Chang Qing, a reporter at the Qingdao Hezong News Agency, who had borrowed a camera from him and not returned it, so he had kept the two typewriters as collateral. Wu Yimin, the owner of the Jindu Securities Company, posted bail for him. The police department sent a telegram to Qingdao to verify the truth. They received a reply stating that Xia had worked in the advertising department of the Minbao for a short time and had been fired for misconduct, that he had not borrowed a camera, and that Chang Qing had lost a typewriter and requested an investigation. The police station summoned the bailer, Wu Yimin, to question Xia's whereabouts, but he had disappeared. After being released on bail, Xia changed his name to Xie Xin and frequented dance halls and pleasure houses, indulging in entertainment. On the evening of July 1st, he took a woman to dinner at the Xueyuan Laozhengxing Restaurant on West Zhongzheng Road. Section Chief Yu Ding saw him and secretly telegraphed the precinct, which dispatched patrolman Yuan Zhenzhi and police officer Lu Foguang to arrest him and take him to the station for questioning. Xia falsely claimed to be the son of Xia Wei, the commander of the Eighth Pacification District. After discovering his deception, the police questioned him exhaustively for several days and nights. He confessed that he had arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao on June 3rd and stayed at the Dahua Hotel. Later, running out of funds, he sold his clothes. One day, he went to the Gongli Hospital on Luban Road, claiming to have a stomach ache. In the X-ray room, he found a typewriter and stole it, hiding it under his raincoat, and sold it to Wu Tianding for 60 million yuan. On June 5th, he fraudulently obtained another typewriter from Zhu Bolin, a staff member of the Public Welfare Auction House on Nanjing Xin Street, and sold it to the Wenhua Typewriter Shop for 105 million yuan. The stolen goods have now been recovered and returned to their original owners. The suspect was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for further investigation yesterday.

### The Face of Lushan, the Summer Capital

— Special Correspondent Liu Wentong

[Kuling, Lushan, July 5th Air Mail] Lushan is like a garden belonging to a wealthy family. However, this wealthy family is now experiencing financial difficulties. Although they have their own garden, they cannot afford to cultivate it properly.

The Lushan Administration is directly under the Jiangxi Provincial Government. The Provincial Government can only provide limited funds, enough to maintain operations in the winter, but not in the summer. Every summer, it requires subsidies from the central government. When Director Wang Zuomin of the Administration took office this spring, he made great efforts to obtain 2 billion yuan to manage this year's summer capital. Three months ago, 2 billion yuan was still valuable and could be used to buy things and do things. For example, Wang Zuomin bought a large amount of diesel fuel to enable the power plant to provide electricity for three months.

A Clever Wife Cannot Cook Without Rice

The chief secretary of the Administration told me that the main tasks in Lushan are public security, sanitation, and transportation. A police station with more than a hundred officers and a company of military police maintain the security of Lushan. The Administration employs a group of sanitation workers to maintain cleanliness. Two thousand porters support the transportation up and down the mountain. All these things cost money. There are other things that should be done, but a clever wife cannot cook without rice.

The Lushan Hospital, which enjoyed a great reputation before the war, now belongs to the Jiujiang Hospital and is the only medical institution on the mountain. Due to lack of funds, it has become a summer resort hospital. It opens in the summer and closes in the winter. Equipment, facilities, and medicine are all inadequate. When Ding Guitang's daughter-in-law fell from a building and was injured, there was not even a plaster bed on the mountain, so she had to be taken to Jiujiang Hospital for treatment. The only twenty beds were filled with lung disease patients. Every day, many poorly dressed ordinary people came up and down the mountain to seek medical treatment.

The banks here are experiencing a cash shortage.

Except for the Jiangxi Provincial Bank, which operates year-round as an agent for the provincial treasury, other banks come to serve vacationers and only operate on the mountain for three months. The Bank of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank have already opened. The Central Bank and the Bank of Communications are also preparing to open. They mainly handle remittances and deposits. People spend money on the mountain, so there are more inward remittances than outward remittances, and most depositors deposit money when it is remitted in and slowly withdraw it. Therefore, the task of the banks is simply to supply banknotes. In the past week, there has been a severe shortage of cash in Kuling. Jiujiang and Nanchang, which supply Kuling, are also experiencing cash shortages. Bank officials are rushing around anxiously for cash. The Shanghai Bank sent a special person down the mountain, asking for 4 billion, but only received 500 million. An old foreign woman only wanted to withdraw 16 million and had to make two or three trips. It is said that the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications are ready to open, but they do not dare to go up the mountain because they do not have cash.

It is said that the exchange rate for telegraphic transfers from Shanghai to Kuling has been as high as 30%.

The cash that goes out of the banks does not come back. Where does the money go? Some people say that the money is being exchanged for silver dollars. As a result, large amounts of banknotes go down the mountain and are distributed to Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Guangdong. While one person sends money, another person takes it away. The faster the banknotes travel, the poorer people become.

The fire in Kuling last spring devastated the area, and it has not recovered this year. The main street, the new street, and the lower street are still in ruins. The shops rebuilt in the ruins, from gold shops to small food shops, are certainly complete, but there are no large-scale businesses.

The main businesses are restaurants, but they are all deserted. There are two gold shops. One is repairing its storefront in preparation for opening, and the other is already open. A few days ago, there was an incident involving the sale of gold that was not up to standard. Imported goods are 20% to 30%, or even 70% to 80%, more expensive than in Shanghai. Jingdezhen porcelain is surprisingly expensive. A set of dining and tea utensils, large and small, more than 190 pieces, sells for more than 100 million yuan. The staff at the coffee shops are so idle that they sit on the counter and doze off. The furniture business is also very slow.

Cultural Undertakings Show Signs of Decline

There is a lack of demand for spiritual food. Among the three bookstores, one specializes in selling new Shanghai books and periodicals. Only thirty to fifty magazines can be sold, and the sales of books are very few. The Commercial Press is located inside the social service center and can only sell several million yuan worth of books a day. The price of books is roughly 20% to 30% higher than in Shanghai.

The only newspaper that can be seen every day is the Jiujiang Daily. The Lushan editions of the Central Daily News and the Lixing Daily from the previous year, and the Lushan Daily from last year, have become memories worth recalling. The Jiujiang Daily is a broadsheet printed on rough paper. It arrives in Kuling every afternoon, with a circulation of only seventy copies. The Chinese New Daily and the Republican Daily from Nanchang are seen only every other day, so their circulation is even smaller. Newspapers from Beijing and Shanghai cannot be seen here.

There are no entertainment venues on the mountain. In the only dance hall, a gramophone plays popular songs, but there are very few people dancing. The swimming pool is open, but the water is too cold, so only some foreigners go into the water.

### Dark Secrets Revealed in Fengxian Agricultural Bank Loan Scandal

[Fengxian, July 7th] The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has a sub-branch in Fengxian, headed by Shi Tairen. On the 31st of last month, the Provincial Bank suddenly sent Nie Wenzhi to Fengxian to audit the accounts. They discovered that a Xin Yu Company in Nanshan had pledged two large packages of tree ears for a large loan that was overdue. Nie personally went to the company to inquire and learned that the owner of the company had not taken out the loan. The loan was forged and impersonated. Further investigation of other companies' pledge loans revealed that they were also largely inaccurate. The local newspapers unanimously criticized the incident, hoping to prompt the Provincial Agricultural authorities to deal with it.

### Bloody Incident in Beiping City, Students of Shenyang Middle School Kill Each Other

Jia Wenjin Seriously Wounded in Chest and Back, Assailant Liao Shuquan Detained for Investigation

[Beiping, July 9th] More than one hundred students from Shenyang Middle School in Northeast China currently reside in Ping Luzu Temple. On the night of the 8th, the student union held a general meeting. When the chairman, Tang Liyuan, was reporting on student welfare, a student named Liao Shuquan expressed dissatisfaction and rebutted him, leading to an argument. Liao raised an axe, threatening Tang, and was dissuaded by other students. However, he continued to express his dissatisfaction. Another student, Jia Wenjin, advised Liao not to act impulsively. Liao, harboring resentment, went to the kitchen, took out a kitchen knife, and stabbed Jia twice in the chest, causing Jia to fall to the ground. Liao then stabbed Jia twice in the back, causing serious injuries. The students immediately turned Liao Shuquan over to the police station, demanding that he be investigated according to the law.

### One Popsicle Sparks Lawsuit, Tang Zhifu Beats His Mother, Accused of Robbery

[Nanjing, July 9th] A bizarre story occurred in the Guantou area outside Shuixi Gate in Nanjing City on the 9th, where an incident over a popsicle escalated into a son beating his mother, and the mother and father jointly accusing their son of robbery. The father's name is Tang Yihe, the mother's name is Wang, and the son's name is Tang Zhifu. Wang bought a popsicle for her younger son because of the hot weather. Zhifu questioned Wang, asking why she didn't buy one for him. An argument ensued, and he beat his mother. The younger brother reported his older brother to the police, who came to arrest him. Tang Yihe and Wang both stated that their son was not only disobedient and unfilial but also often beat his parents and was connected to bandits in the Dangtu-Jiangning area. He had even participated in kidnapping with a gang, and his wife, Zhang Yuzhi, had been robbed. Zhang Yuzhi stated that she originally had a husband named Ma Shaowu, who was an officer in the Dangtu-Jiangning security team and had also been a bandit. He was killed by Zhang Zichun, a bandit, who then took possession of her. Later, Tang Zhifu robbed her from Zhang Zichun and brought her to Nanjing. Zhang stated that she was often beaten in Nanjing and often saw Tang beat his mother. The police station often sent Zhifu to the Capital District Court Prosecutor's Office for prosecution.

To alleviate the hardships of the employees and solve the above difficulties, County Magistrate Wang Shaozeng will request the appropriation of stored grain when the County Council convenes its fifth general meeting on the 10th of this month. He will also sell 600 dan of unpolished rice currently in stock to temporarily distribute 1 million times the allowance, and then make a full payment after the County Council makes a decision.

### Jiangxi Restricts Private Cultivated Land

(2) Dry land shall be doubled in quantity compared to superior, medium, and inferior paddy fields. (3) For those with both paddy and dry land, the calculation shall be based on the above-mentioned ratio.

(5) The total area of private cultivated land per household shall be based on the grain tax register or the consolidated household register, the land price tax register, and the household's land deed. The county and municipal governments shall collect the total area of excess cultivated land of each household, as well as its type, grade, location, and compile a registration book, which shall be distributed to each township office to notify the household heads concerned.

(6) After being notified, the household head shall, within 30 days, in accordance with the limits in Articles 5 and 6, list and declare to the township office the type, grade, area, location, etc., of the cultivated land they voluntarily retain and the excess cultivated land they sell, which shall be forwarded to the municipal and county governments for approval. The name of the household and the area, type, grade, location, etc., of the excess cultivated land they sell shall be listed separately and announced in front of the local township office for farmers to purchase.

(7) When cultivated land is sold, the buyers shall be: (1) The original tenant farmers or hired laborers cultivating the land. (2) Retired soldiers with farming ability and families of soldiers who fought in the war of resistance. (3) Tenant farmers and hired laborers in the village. (4) Tenant farmers and hired laborers in the township. (5) Self-cultivating farmers in the township. (6) The village production cooperative or township office. (7) Tenant farmers, hired laborers, and self-cultivating farmers in neighboring townships.

(8) If there are several buyers in the same order for local public welfare organizations and schools, the decision shall be made by lottery.

(10) Those whose private cultivated land exceeds the limit shall sell the excess cultivated land within two years from the promulgation of these measures. Those who exceed the limit shall be subject to legal requisition and be distributed to farmers who cultivate the land themselves.

(11) After the implementation of these measures, if there are landlords who anonymously or under an assumed name intend to evade the regulations, they shall be investigated and registered in accordance with the provisions of the Name Usage Restriction Ordinance, and the owners shall be penalized.

Mr. Zhang Ba and Jun Liangyun stated: Xietu Road in this city is the only way for long-distance buses to Songhu, Minhang, and Hangzhou, as well as cargo vehicles to Zhapu, Hangzhou, and other highways. Traffic is frequent on weekdays, but since the Jinzhou Bicycle Factory connected water pipes, the road has been sunk into two large gaps. When cars pass by, they often jolt violently. If it is a heavy vehicle, the iron plate is easily broken, which not only makes driving inconvenient, but also has a close relationship with the safety of passengers. Previously, the authorities of the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Long-Distance Bus Company sent workers to fill the road with soil, but it is said that they were prevented by the factory. As the area is under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, it should be requested that the relevant department of the bureau immediately investigate and order the factory to fill the road as soon as possible. This matter concerns driving safety and public safety. Please publish this in your newspaper to promote the attention of the relevant parties and remedy the situation. Sincerely, to the Social Services Department of Shen Bao.

Patients with Ascites Seeking Effective Medical Treatment

Editor: My mother has been suffering from ascites for two years. Recently, her abdomen has become increasingly enlarged, and she is in critical condition. Although she has been treated by both Chinese and Western doctors, all treatments have been ineffective. I am a poor civil servant with a very meager monthly income, and the amount spent on medical expenses is already huge, leaving me with no financial resources to bear further expenses. I would like to borrow a corner of your column to ask those who have suffered from this disease and recovered for an effective medical prescription, or to introduce an experienced doctor, so that I can find a way to seek treatment again, so that my mother can escape the sea of suffering. If you approve, it will be an immeasurable act of merit. Reader Sheng Kuisheng respectfully. Address: No. 274, Lane 274, (25) Road, Shanghai.

### Increased Arrivals, Stagnant Sales, Rice Prices Decline, Flour, Grains, and Cooking Oil All Fall Yesterday

The rice market turned down due to increased arrivals. Rice shops were weak in receiving, the outgoing road was stagnant, quotations in Wuxi were also weak, and people's hearts were weak, so prices fell. In the Southern market, white japonica rice was 45 million, thin rice was 48.1 million, and early rice and other varieties fell by 2 million to 2.5 million.

Lao Che flour opened at 16.3 million per package, down 1 million from last week. Bingchuan flour fell 850,000. Hongfeng flour was uniquely sought after because the Guangdong gangs were taking deliveries, opening at 15.7 million and closing at 16.2 million, higher than Bingchuan, down only 300,000. Other brands of flour fell 300,000 to 500,000, bran fell 800,000, and wheat was quoted at 21 million per factory package.

Miscellaneous grains trended lower, with fewer customers from other provinces taking deliveries, and sales becoming stagnant.

### Vigor in Tea Exports

After the export merchants here repeatedly requested increased tea prices for green teas such as Chou Zhen Zhen Mei, to which the foreign firms in the foreign tea market were reluctant to pay, it is heard that some have now been approved. Therefore, buying enthusiasm has returned, and the process has suddenly become active after being stagnant for a long time. In terms of prices, holders are reluctant to release their goods lightly due to high costs, so they remain sharp. As for Qimen black tea, British merchants continued to try to purchase it smoothly, but the market inventory was depleted, and supply could not meet demand, so the situation was stable in the quiet. As for domestic sales tea, there were some imports and exports, but there was a lack of change.

### Mixed Yarn Price Fluctuations

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were due to the excessive surge in the past week. Customers seemed to dislike the expensive prices, and their enthusiasm weakened. Although the industry's money supply was loose, the buying interest was weak, and the local street trend was stagnant, and the market trend was soft.

Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially opened strongly at 80 million, but later returned to 100 million lower due to the sale by manufacturers. Then, due to active sales, the buying atmosphere in the market was strong, and the market suddenly turned upward, and finally closed at 256 million, 80 million for tomorrow's delivery, an increase of 140 million to 10 million compared to the end of last week.

### Rising Chinese Medicine

Western top Huang Qi is out of stock, Tianjin Huang Qi is sought after, with a trend of rushing out of the 2 million mark. Orange collaterals are above Guang Chenpi, and scarcity is causing hoarding, and the momentum is rising. Fang Feng is closely following, and Xixin is not far away, with a price of 4 million and lively trading. Bai Zi Ren's price is shouting 3 million higher, but there is no transaction. Gangzhou Tou Hong dramatically rose to 36 million.

### Leisurely Atmosphere in Chinese Stocks

The trend of Chinese stocks is weak, and yarn and cloth are first flat and then slightly lower. People's minds are relaxed, and the industry's money supply is generally loose. The buying interest of the various gangs is very weak. After the Yong Yarn market opened, the market price improved frequently due to the loose money supply and the coverage of yesterday's scattered short positions. Later, it was heard that various non-industry goods were flat and tired, and the authorities had news of throwing goods, which made people feel timid. The various gangs vomited, and the market conditions took a step back, and there was still no interest in the close. Except for Qin Xing and Jingfu, which were slightly firmer, the remaining stocks were dull.

In the later market, due to the still loose money supply and the lower interest rates of yarn factories, Yong yarn reported at 13,750 yuan, only adding 100 yuan, and the fluctuations were quite flat. The first file of Maya was quoted at 580-585 yuan, and the trend was firm. Xinguang has not escaped the tired state, and the first quotation was 140 yuan.

### World Olympics Basketball Elimination Round: Our Country Wins Against Switzerland by Eight Points; Morale Affected, Performance Extremely Dispersed; Second Match Today Against Great Britain in the Quarterfinals

[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th (broadcast): The Chinese basketball team, in the third group elimination round for 17th place—which the British, in their fine-sounding words, call the third championship—the first to eighth places being the first championship, and the ninth to sixteenth places being the second championship—defeated Switzerland by a score of 42 to 34. The Chinese team, after falling from a shared group championship to fifth place, was undoubtedly greatly affected. The players' morale was scattered, a far cry from the demeanor when competing against first-class powerhouses like Chile, Belgium, and Korea. At the end of the first half, the score was 25 to 20, China leading by five points. After the start of the second half, Switzerland scored four consecutive points. China only had Wu Chengzhang make a basket under the net. Afterwards, Bao Songmao committed a foul, and Switzerland scored a point from the free throw, creating a tense situation where the difference was only one point, 25 to 27. After the audience frequently cheered them on, the Chinese team slightly rallied. Li Shiqiao and Cai Wenhua repeatedly made long shots, all hitting the target. Wu Chengzhang also gradually became more active. Switzerland exerted all their strength to compete, and the battle became more intense. Finally, China won by four points, with a score of 42 to 34.

Although Switzerland's skills are not as good as China's, their consistent fighting spirit far surpasses China's. In this battle, the Chinese team's formation was chaotic, with no direction in attack or retreat. In terms of defense, there were especially many loopholes. Bao Songmao's problem of straying far from his defensive position reappeared repeatedly. It was only because the opponent was not strong. The Chinese team repeatedly substituted players, but it was still difficult to stimulate the flagging morale. China will meet Great Britain, which has already defeated Ireland, tomorrow afternoon. Italy has also defeated Iraq and will face Egypt, which had a bye in the first week.

### French Team Wins Against Chile; 53 to 52, Victory Decided in Overtime; Enters Basketball Championship Quarterfinals Week

[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th (broadcast): In the World Olympics basketball championship finals, France fought hard and defeated Chile by one point in overtime, gaining the right to advance to the quarterfinals. When the regular time ended, each team had 42 points. The five-minute overtime resulted in a score of 53 to 52. France won by one point in a very thrilling game. France will compete with the winner of the Brazil-Czechoslovakia match for the championship final.

Chinese Basketball Team Still Lacking in Methods

[British News Agency, London, 9th dispatch] Among the most unforgettable moments in the World Olympics basketball competition is the match between China and Korea. All World Olympics basketball games are held in the indoor arena in northern London called Haringey, which has comfortable seating for 11,000 spectators. Basketball has not yet become a popular sport in Great Britain, so the arena rarely has more than one-tenth of its seats filled. However, since the start of the World Olympics basketball competition, the number of spectators has been increasing daily. When China and Korea competed in basketball, the number of spectators was between 1,500 and 2,000.

Compared with the previous two matches against Belgium and Chile, the Chinese team has made progress in the following areas: First, the success rate of free throws has greatly increased. Second, it can consolidate the rear defense when the time and situation become increasingly tense. After the Koreans get the ball, our team retreats to defend, often adopting a relaxed five-person defensive formation. The Koreans constantly break through using a swift two-person combination method, which is one person dribbling and dashing forward, and when they can no longer advance, they turn and throw the ball to the second person. The latter gets the ball and immediately shoots. This combination method disrupts the five-person defensive formation, causing the second person to often no longer be monitored by us. As a result, the Koreans made three out of four shots. Every time the Chinese team's score approaches the Korean team to within three to five points, the Koreans immediately score one or two baskets with the speed of escaping rabbits. When the situation became increasingly critical, our team abandoned the relaxed five-person defensive method and used "guard your man" as a slogan, and the Koreans' attempts began to be thwarted.

Although we defeated Korea, the individual skills of the players are good, but there are many areas in the linking and passing aspects that need improvement. Our actions are slow, causing the opposing team to succeed in regaining the ball and consolidating their defense. We still have no method or system to break through the five-person defensive formation. To date, we rely too much on standing and passing the ball, as well as ineffective shooting. The former only wastes time, and the latter is fraught with difficulties. The above are the actual reasons for the defeat against the Philippines by a score of 51 to 32 the following evening. The Philippine team's overall connection work is superior to our team's. They have a prescribed system and method, both of which are offensive and defensive. We can still achieve improvement in this area in a short period of time.

### London Overseas Chinese Host Chinese World Olympics Representatives

[British News Agency, London, 9th dispatch] The London Overseas Chinese hosted the Chinese World Olympics Committee last weekend, with about 200 people attending. When the enthusiastic atmosphere reached its peak, the Chinese Ambassador and Dr. Wang Zhengting also joined in dancing the conga.

[British News Agency, 9th dispatch] Chen Yinglang, the Chinese National Games champion, participated in the 400-meter race. This race was divided into eleven or twelve groups, with a total of 70 athletes. The fastest time was 48.3 seconds, and the slowest time was 51.4 seconds. Chen finished third in the first group of six, maintaining his National Games record with 50.9 seconds. A Yugoslav athlete won second place with 50.5 seconds. Because only two people from each group are allowed to participate in the semi-finals, Chen was eliminated. However, viewed from the high point of the stadium, Chen's running posture was excellent, and he did not slacken a step throughout the race.

### An Old Story About Women's High Jump Runner-Up, Mrs. Dael

[Report from this newspaper] London, 8th (broadcast): The women's high jump champion, Alice Coachman from the United States, is a black female sports star. She and the runner-up, Mrs. Dael from Great Britain, both broke the World Olympics record with a score of 1.68 meters. Coachman cleared the height in one jump, while Dael cleared it in two jumps, which is how the rankings were determined. Twelve years ago, the World Olympics were held in Berlin. Dael was unmarried and was still Miss Dorothy Odam. She participated in the women's high jump and also achieved the same score as the champion from Hungary. The rankings were also determined by the number of attempts, and she finished as the runner-up. The two events are strikingly similar. Is Mrs. Dael perhaps destined to never be the champion? The third place in this year's competition was France's Micheline Ostermeyer, with 1.61 meters. The fourth place was Jamaica's Vinton Beckett, the fifth place was Canada's Patricia Trainor, and the sixth place was Great Britain's Kroonseh, all with 1.58 meters.

Irvine, the black American male sprint star, finished as the runner-up in both the 100-meter and 200-meter races. He reached the finish line at the same time as Patton in the 200-meter race, with the same score, but was judged to be in second place. He and Mrs. Dael can be said to be in the same boat.

### Rowing Competition is Heated

[United Press, London, 9th dispatch] The University of Washington four-oared rowing team (with coxswain), representing the United States, sped forward on the 9th, defeating Switzerland and Denmark to take first place.

There are a total of three events, and the United States hopes to sweep all three championships. So far, they have won one. The United States team's time was 6 minutes 50.3 seconds, Switzerland was second with 6 minutes 53.3 seconds, and Denmark was third with 6 minutes 56.8 seconds. The entire course was 1,900 meters. At the start of the race, the United States and Denmark started with 40 strokes per minute, while Switzerland only had 38 strokes per minute. At 50 meters, Switzerland was first, and the United States was second. At 500 yards, the United States and Denmark were neck and neck, with Switzerland still in the lead. At 750 meters, Switzerland was only leading by two feet, and Denmark was slightly ahead of the United States. Switzerland maintained the lead at 1,200 meters.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th (broadcast): Australia won the single sculls rowing competition, defeating Uruguay and Italy.

### United States Protests 400-Meter Relay; Film Review Today; British and American Sides Each Hold Their Own Views

[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th (broadcast): The United States team was disqualified in the 400-meter relay final, and the British team replaced them. According to track and field judges, the second runner, Laider, crossed the designated exchange zone when handing the baton to the first runner, Irvine. The United States team's head coach, Cromwell, immediately filed a formal protest. The appellate review committee originally planned to screen the 400-meter relay film on Sunday to observe and decide whether the United States team had committed a foul. It is now known that the screening of the film has been postponed to Tuesday. According to the United States, the film shows that the United States team did not commit a foul. However, Cassilliona-Ade, the Olympic film producer, said that the film he shot clearly shows that the United States team committed a foul and should be disqualified.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th (broadcast): In this tournament, the Chinese basketball team and the Korean team were in the same group, and both scored eight points. Moreover, China even defeated Korea. However, Korea is now ranked in the top eight, and even if China wins every match in the third elimination round, they will at most get 17th place. This is an example that proves that in the current competition system, fate controls everything.

In two weeks, it is undoubtedly difficult to judge the merits of more than 20 teams. This time's round-robin elimination system is relatively complete, but the result is still not good. China's sacrifice is an example. Many countries believe that the decisiveness of fate in this system is even greater than that shown in the double-elimination system.

Since failing to adopt double-elimination in 1936, the International Amateur Basketball Association has been researching, hoping to obtain a more ideal and fair competition system, so that the competition can reach the fairest possible point within the possible scope. However, twelve years of exploration have still failed.

Therefore, the congress representatives and the directors of the International Amateur Basketball Association have scheduled a joint meeting today (10th) to discuss the competition method to be used in the next World Olympics in 1952. A perfect competition system cannot of course be produced in a couple of hours. Today's meeting is limited to a discussion of principles. Branch details will have to be deeply discussed by the Basketball Association. Revisions to basketball rules to suit the American fast system, and fouls, etc., will also be on the agenda of the meeting.

World Olympics Correspondence

### Ancient London Has a New Atmosphere; Chinese Athletes Are in Good Spirits

—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zhong Zhen

[Special Correspondence for This Newspaper, London] July 25th (Sunday). In extreme haste, this reporter took the 8:05 am express train from Paris, crossed the English Channel, and arrived at London Victoria Station at 4:40 pm. Everywhere in the station were posters and advertisements for the World Olympics, as well as colorful and eye-catching flags welcoming athletes from various countries, which added a new atmosphere to this ancient and old station. On Piccadilly Circus, the busiest area in central London, the statue of Cupid was also surrounded by colorful flags participating in the World Olympics. It is rare to see the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag abroad, but it was actually waving in the wind, flying in the airspace of Great Britain, which made the Chinese people very excited. On the road, one can constantly encounter athletes in uniforms selected from various countries. The number of tourists to England has also suddenly increased several times. The streets of London are crowded with colorful foreign tourists, and most hotels have "full" signs hanging up. All the shops are doing thriving business and making ten thousand times their profits. However, apart from luxury goods that can be sold freely and without limit, all daily necessities and food are still very strictly controlled, so their prices have not been affected by the World Olympics and have not risen sharply, which makes the British citizens in a state of material hardship feel even more pain.

The office of the Chinese delegation is located in the Marble Arch area at the Mount Royal Hotel. The athletes' dormitory is in a quieter area in the south of London (Kilburn) on Priory Park Road at the Kilburn Polytechnic School. The school is a new-style five-story Western-style building with a brown artificial stone facade. The Olympic flag and a huge Chinese national flag are hanging on the roof, which feels solemn and simple. Outside the door were crowded British children driven by curiosity, waiting for the athletes to sign their names. The basement of the building has been converted into a restaurant. The first floor is a conference room (because the office at the Royal Hotel has been canceled) and a reception room. A huge national flag is hung in the center of the room, and the table is filled with promotional materials from British travel agencies. From the second to the fifth floors are the athletes' bedrooms, with about ten people in a room. Small iron beds are arranged in two rows, neatly and beautifully. The nutrition of the athletes is not a problem, because a large number of vermicelli, ham, pickles, preserved eggs, mushrooms, and other foods have been shipped from China in advance, and the conference also has Chinese cooks who provide exquisite and delicious Chinese dishes every day. The athletes' lives are very disciplined. Every morning, they must take a bus to the training ground for practice. During the day, they go to the training ground to practice or observe the training of athletes from other countries and the competitions of other teams. They must return to the dormitory before 11:00 pm so that the athletes can have sufficient rest. Therefore, the athletes are all in good spirits and excited.

Foreigners also respect our selection of athletes. Although no item has been formally selected to win, it is generally believed that the performance of the Chinese athletes is not bad, especially for the glorious battle of Chinese basketball, which is highly praised. Although our football team suffered a crushing defeat as soon as it appeared, it was defeated by Turkey, which is known for its reputation in Europe, and is also well-forgiven. The battle in the friendly match with the tall and elite American World Olympics team at the Oxbridge Stadium at 5:00 pm on July 26th is especially worthy of praise by the world. Tickets were also sold for the game. In the first half, the American team welcomed two goals, which made the athletes of the New World happy in their expressions. Later, He Yingfen on our left wing pulled back a goal, making it 1 to 2. Our country was slightly frustrated in the first half. In the second half, our team cooperated and launched a fierce attack. Center forward Zhu Yongqiang made a special surprise shot and scored a goal, making it a 2-to-1 draw. The spirit of our country's athletes was even more uplifted, and after a long time of fierce fighting, He Yingfen scored another goal, resulting in a 3-to-2 comeback victory. On the first test in a foreign country, they defeated the excellent American team, and public opinion was divided, all believing that Chinese football has a lot of hope. Who knows that God does not help people, and in both draws, they met Turkey. The passionate support of the overseas Chinese for the athletes is that the motherland, after decades of war, is now facing new economic panic and all kinds of difficulties, but with great determination, under the lack of financial and material resources, resolutely convened the first National Games after the war to select the World Olympics athletes, which is so exciting. Although we have not been able to return with honors this time, we have left a good impression on foreigners. Moreover, the experience gained from this observation and research is enough to be the foundation for promoting sports in our country in the future. It is hoped that in the next World Olympics four years later, our country's achievements can keep pace with the wheels of the times, raise our eyebrows and exhale, and win glory for the motherland.

### Hockey Championship Will Go to Indian Team

There are only four pairs registered for women's doubles. According to the previous meeting's decision, each doubles group must have five pairs to be a formal competition, so registration will continue to be solicited. If there are no participants, these four pairs will be changed to exhibition matches and a single round-robin system will be adopted. The schedule will be arranged separately.

### Tuition Fees for Private Primary and Secondary Schools; Reasonable Standards to Be Discussed Within the Week; Education Bureau to Convene a Meeting of Private School Principals

[Report from this newspaper] The issue of tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools in the second half of this year is of great concern to all sectors of society. This reporter specially visited Mayor Wu yesterday to ask about the policy. Wu said: It is very headache to consider both the burden on the family and the school's expenses. However, the mayor believes that the school authorities' method of calculating tuition fees based on the price of rice is quite unreasonable. He has instructed Li Himou, Acting Director of the Education Bureau, to convene a meeting of private primary and secondary school principals within the week to discuss and determine reasonable standards.

### Random Notes from Airing Books

— Bai Yong

Aside from a few books in my collection, it can be said that I am utterly impoverished. Although ancient poets often expressed an "Ah Q" spirit with sayings like "having books is not poverty," boiling words cannot satisfy hunger. When things get desperate, I can only endure the complaints of my wife and children.

I seem to recall a few excellent lines about poverty and buying books in Yuan Mei's "Suiyuan Shihua." The weather is so hot that I don't have the courage to look them up, and my memory for poetry is terrible. I only vaguely remember Yuan himself having a line: "When well-fed, I worry about going to the market; when my family is poor, I dream of buying books." This feeling is very real, and it remains so even now. Some people compare books to food, but there is a fundamental difference between the two. When extremely hungry, grass roots, tree bark, and kaolin clay can all be used to fill the stomach, but books cannot be compromised in this way. One would rather not read than indulge in inferior, nauseating works. Anyone with a fondness for reading generally has a tendency to respect their own interests, and this cannot be denied. Therefore, if there are good books that one cannot buy, one will indeed "think about them day and night." Over the years, the price of blank newsprint has increased almost twenty millionfold. Publishers are unwilling to print books, and they are unwilling to sell them at low prices. The market reflects a lack of quantity and weak purchasing power. Despite book prices rising every three days and changing every five, bookstores are deserted. Having goods without being able to sell them is futile. Thus, those who dream can only dream forever, and those who lose money have no way to recoup it. The things we cannot obtain even in our dreams are the very things they cannot get rid of, no matter what. "Jean-Christophe" and "Nana" weep silently in the warehouses, while young students suffer unrequited love. This alone is enough to illustrate the unreasonableness of everything.

Collecting books is also a problem now. First, there is the matter of housing. In Shanghai, it's measured in gold bars; in Nanjing and other cities, it's measured in white rice. We certainly cannot afford to spend one shi and five dou of rice to rent a room for books, so we can only let them suffer a bit in the bedroom. Second, there are the bookshelves. Even the cheapest glass cabinet costs fifty million, and a bamboo or wicker shelf costs over ten million. We sometimes even have trouble finding a place to sleep, so how can we possibly find a place for them? Since all of this is out of the question, can we even call it collecting books? What a pathetic sight!

However, mice and bookworms show no mercy. A copy of the "Sanxitang Calligraphy Collection" has had its last volume eaten clean, perhaps to serve as swaddling clothes for a young mouse master. Fortunately, they showed restraint and didn't dig a large hole through the middle volume. The "Guiyi Leigao" and manuscript newspapers are covered in spiderwebs, with insect eggs suspended on yellowed silk threads, as if this learned and insightful man from three hundred years ago had also suffered misfortune.

There's no other way but to move the bed out and expose it to the ninety-degree sunlight outside for disinfection. Zhu Zhuyu had the Pavilion for Airing Books, and Qian Yiji also wrote "Miscellaneous Notes on Airing Books." I can only call this an airing-book couch. Although it's simple, spreading the books out on it feels like reuniting with old friends after a long separation. Each book contains a complex and moving story, which can serve as one of my "summer pastimes."

I am someone who cannot specialize. My reading is broad and unrefined—perhaps this is the root cause of my lack of accomplishment? The things being aired before me contain several contradictions. It's not just the head-on collision of "Hanxue Shicheng Ji" versus "Hanxue Shangdui." For example, from the far-right "Mein Kampf" to the far-left "Biography of Marx," it is worth studying both. I also like to buy both Chinese herbal-style plant catalogs and the latest cataloged plant atlases, in order to compare the traces of progress to some extent. Perhaps in my miscellaneous studies, I cannot avoid a historical bias. I only regret that China does not have someone as knowledgeable and profound as Sir Fraser, who could write a great and detailed general history of customs and habits, like "The Golden Bough." Even the defeated Japanese are willing to put in hard work when it comes to scholarship. No wonder the magnificent dozens of volumes of "Korean Ancient Relics Atlas" and "Chinese Historical Relics Atlas" are valued in gold bars. Has anyone in China ever done such a labor-intensive work? Sir Stein's "Thousand Buddhas" and "Ancient Khotan," to me, are like Yuan Mei's poems—I can only glimpse their glorious appearance in dreams.

The entire Earth is currently sinking. Perhaps it is because of this that I feel the old historical relics are so lovely and precious. It's a pity that we ourselves cannot talk about any decent publications now. Even in times of peace, we have never had any amazing achievements. This year, the Academia Sinica finally printed a copy of "Xiaotun" (i.e., the first volume of inscriptions from the Ruins of Yin) to give us a little face, but I fear it will be difficult to continue. Looking at the publications on the street newsstands, which are as thin as a consumptive patient in the third stage of tuberculosis, one cannot help but wonder if Chinese culture is only left with these skeletal remains. Without mentioning anything else, just looking at American publications like "The Saturday Evening Post" and "Look," one will feel like one is on the verge of death, even if they are full of advertisements and pornography, don't they still have that extra energy?

### What I Know of Wu Qingyuan (Part 1)

— Chen Yixian

Recently, I read Mr. Fen Yun's article "Also on Wu Qingyuan" in this column, which recounts Wu Qingyuan's chess match with the Japanese at Qingyun Pavilion in 1927, which was extremely interesting. I happened to be in Beiping at the time. Although I did not participate in the grand event at Qingyun Pavilion, according to what I heard, the person who played chess with Wu Qingyuan was not the sixth-dan master that Cao Rulin brought from Japan, nor was it the seventh-dan Yue Yingzuo mentioned by Yu Shoujun. It was actually the fifth-dan Japanese player, Inoue Kohei. The meeting between Inoue fifth-dan and Qingyuan at Qingyun Pavilion was jointly sponsored by the Beiping Weiqi (Go) enthusiasts. The owner of Qingyun Pavilion, Han Shenxian (Xia Shanlou Master), was also fond of this art and was willing to use a part of the upstairs as the venue. One year before this meeting, Iwamoto sixth-dan and Kosugi fourth-dan from the Japanese Go Institute visited Beiping and hosted a welcome chess match at Wansui House in Babao Hutong, Dongcheng. Liu Dihuai, Gu Shuiru, and Wu Qingyuan (thirteen years old) attended. Iwamoto played against Liu Dihuai, giving him a two-stone handicap, and Liu won. He then played against Gu Shuiru, giving him a two-stone handicap, and Gu lost. Finally, Iwamoto sixth-dan played against Qingyuan, giving him a three-stone handicap, and Qingyuan won. Therefore, Qingyuan's reputation in Go was already known to the Japanese when he was thirteen years old. The fact that the Chinese side chose Qingyuan to play against someone above the fifth-dan at the Qingyun Pavilion was a coincidence, and it was not because Liu Dihuai and others were afraid of Inoue and dared not compete with him.

At that time, Inoue and Wu Qingyuan played three games in total. The first game was at Qingyun Pavilion in November 1927, when Qingyuan was fourteen years old. He played black first and the game ended in "interruption" (a Japanese Go term meaning unfinished game). Two days later, the two played again at Li Lvge's house, and Qingyuan won by "nakaoshi" (another Japanese Go term). Two days after that, the two played again at Zhang Boju's house, and Inoue Kohei won by nakaoshi. At that time, there was a Japanese businessman in Beiping named Yamazaki Yumin who was also fond of Go. He sent the scores of these three games back to Japan to Yasui Senkaku, who was a seventh-dan player. Yasui was greatly surprised when he saw them, believing that Wu Qingyuan was only fourteen years old, yet had such skill in Go, with the style of the young Honinbo Shusaku, the national Go saint. Thus, he developed the idea of inviting Qingyuan to Japan. Later, Qingyuan went to Japan and joined the Japanese Go Institute, which was based on the three games he played with Inoue fifth-dan.

Once Yasui had the intention of inviting Qingyuan to Japan, he sent his student Hashimoto Utaro (fourth-dan) to Beiping in 1928 to test Qingyuan's strength. Hashimoto played two games with Qingyuan and reported back to his teacher, praising Qingyuan's Go skills greatly. Thus, the name of the Chinese genius Go prodigy Wu Qingyuan spread throughout Japan, and Yasui's intention to invite Qingyuan to Japan became even more firm. At the time, Inukai Tsuyoshi, Makino Nobuaki, Okura Kihachiro, and Mochizuki Keisuke also had the same idea. There were many exchanges of letters between Tokyo and Beiping, all handled by Yamazaki Yumin. When Yoshizawa Kenkichi (Inukai Tsuyoshi's son-in-law) became the Chinese minister, the plan for Qingyuan to travel to Japan took a sharp turn for the better and was largely decided. When Okura Kihachiro agreed to pay for all of Qingyuan's living expenses in Japan, Qingyuan, along with his mother and his brother Wu Huan, set off from Tianjin on the Chang'an Maru. During the journey, major newspapers such as the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun and the Jiji Shinpo competed to report his journey with large-character headlines such as "The Qilin Child Wu Qingyuan Arrives" and "The Rare Great Genius Wu Qingyuan." When the train arrived at Tokyo Station, Honinbo Shusai, Yasui Senkaku's followers, the director of the Japanese Go Institute, Yata Kyosuke, and many other famous figures in the Japanese Go world were all at the station to welcome him. The scene was unprecedentedly grand.

### Fireflies

— Pu

The elegant affair of "flitting fireflies with a light silk fan" is something everyone has experienced in childhood.

On cool summer nights, specks of firefly light drift everywhere, like celestial maidens winking their pretty eyes, emitting a faint green glow that is so gentle and serene, composing the beauty of summer nights.

Fireflies never fly into halls, rooms, or any other places with lights. If they do fly into halls and bedrooms, it is only after you have turned off the lights. Only in dim courtyards can fireflies be found, and the places with the most firefly light are on desolate mountains, in open fields, beside graveyards, among乱草, and in old forests. These places are often like rain from the sky, because these places are shrouded in darkness all night, never having even a little light shone upon them. The light of fireflies is meant to illuminate the darkness. They refuse to fly into places that already have light, doing unnecessary and wasteful work. They provide charcoal in the snow, rather than gilding the lily, even though they only have such a tiny source of light.

I wonder if you have ever had the chance to see a firefly that has just fossilized in the soil cracks at the base of a wall? It is truly rare. At this time, that small bit of firefly light is still shining there, but it is quietly congealed, not flickering, not moving. After ten minutes, the light gradually fades away. Although the firefly's life has ended, the remaining bit of light in its life must continue to exert its utmost until it is exhausted. Even in death, it is still thinking about the darkness of the human world.

### The Classic of Wood

— Gongsun Wu

Commonly speaking, construction materials mainly consist of bricks, tiles, wood, stone, lime, and nails. Today's steel bars and concrete were unknown in the past. Among those who could skillfully and perfectly utilize the limited materials, Yu Hao in Ouyang Xiu's "Gui Tian Lu" was one such person. The Lingyun Terrace was built during the Three Kingdoms period, and this technique became even more refined during the Song Dynasty, which need not be discussed. "Gui Tian Lu" states, "The Kaibao Temple Pagoda is the tallest among the pagodas in the capital, and its structure is very refined. It was built by the chief artisan Yu Hao. When the pagoda was first completed, it appeared crooked and tilted to the northwest. People were puzzled and asked him about it. Hao said, 'The land in the capital is flat without mountains, and there are many northwest winds. After a hundred years of being blown by the wind, it will straighten itself.' His meticulousness was such. Since the founding of the dynasty, he has been the only such woodworker. To this day, woodworkers all regard Chief Yu as their standard. There is a three-volume 'Classic of Wood' circulating in the world." This record can also prove my observation that tall buildings that sway in the wind are sturdy. However, pagoda construction should mainly use brick and stone as the main materials. Master Yu is not like today's so-called bricklayers, but is known as a woodworker, which I do not understand. It is a pity that I cannot continue his book. Liu Zongyuan wrote about Chief Du Liao building a house, refusing to follow customs, and titled his piece "Biography of the Carpenter." The person is good at measuring materials, "drawing a palace on the wall, one foot in size, intricately making its structure, calculating its smallest details, and constructing large buildings without any errors." The biography mentions the use of axes, adzes, knives, and saws, so the Chief Du Liao is indeed a woodworker.

### Remembering Ah Hong

— Bai Jiao

Ah Hong is six years old, likes to play and doesn't recognize words. Chen's book makes one sleepy, he closes the book and refuses to look at it. He also tires of toys, his mind is only on fruits and snacks. His bag contains a hundred treasures, his little companions look at it. He monopolizes a small stone pen, providing a variety of things for collection, peanuts, chocolates, the categories are each different. His father is often away from home, he often looks forward to his father's arrival, his father is amiable and thoughtful, he remembers only one thing.

His little kisses produce old sayings, often making the old people laugh. Or when he sees a guest come, he rushes to tell them, or when he writes a word successfully, he loves to hear people say it's good. His restlessness has the nature of a dog, he doesn't wear a hat when it's cold. When he comes back from school, the sound he makes upon entering the door is already noisy, as if he is playing a triumphant song, and he opens his mouth asking for reassurance. His little sister is also elegant, often discussing how much there is.

When his mother goes back to Ningbo, Ah Hong sleeps with me, pulling and tugging, chattering about childish things, urging him to work hard and study diligently, he says he has ambition. Every midnight he startles grandfather, his feet powerfully pushing away the blanket, his mouth seems to be saying something, or perhaps he continues with tears; how could it be that in his little dreams there are things that are not as he wishes?

### 

Churchill's memoirs, describing the beginning of the Second World War, when England and France declared war on Germany, when he was on the roof looking at the air defense equipment, and the arrangement of the bomb shelter in the basement, he immediately imagined the deafening air raids, the collapse of the houses, the smoke and fire, the coming and going of ambulances, the desolate desolation of broken walls and ruins; everything was right before his eyes. In the past, Chinese literary giants had works such as "Lamenting the Ancient Battlefield," which were based on already destroyed relics, and imagined the past. Mr. Qiu "pre-lamented the battlefield." The London Blitz was in July and August of the following year, and the shocking scene had already become an unavoidable fact. The reason for this is that in this war, new weapons (airplanes and bombs) were prepared by the Germans first, and at the beginning, the British air force was inferior in comparison, so the world's first royal city was filled with the terror of ruins.

Scientific weapons are constantly changing and renewing, inadvertently revealing three eras. The First World War was still a plane war mainly based on artillery and tanks. The Second World War was a three-dimensional war with airplanes and bombs and the coordination of the navy and army. The Third World War will be a destructive war with the power of "atoms." And the new weapons of each period must reveal some information in the previous period to hint at the future.

In 1914, the German army broke through Belgium to attack France, relying on 42-centimeter heavy cannons to conquer the Liege fortress, and later galloped eastward and westward. All relied on the products of the Krupp factory. At that time, the classification of aircraft was not precise, and the number was not large, only for reconnaissance and occasional attacks, and they were often shot down. By the later stage of the war, reconnaissance aircraft, fighter aircraft, and bomber aircraft were separated, but the production was not very sound, and the war ended suddenly. However, the dominance of the air force in the Second World War was already determined at this time. Germany devoted itself to unremitting cultivation during the period between the two major wars, and its feathers were full, so at the beginning of the Second World War, iron crows were flying around, sweeping through Poland and the Netherlands into Paris, and sweeping across Europe. In addition to bombing, the airborne transport of gliders was even more miraculous. However, there was a lack of material resources, and the oil supply was even more difficult to sustain. When the United States entered the war, with its abundant production, new and ingenious creations, and agility surpassing Germany, it returned the favor in its own way. The so-called three-axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan all succumbed to the decline in air power. The victory or defeat of this five-year war was determined by the quality of the air force.

Then, as the war was about to end, it suddenly "played the final movement of elegance." In August 1945, two small objects gracefully visited Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, turning these two major bustling cities into ashes in an instant. Compared with the tragic scene in England in August 1940, it was ten times greater, and the economic efficiency of time was inversely proportional to the bombing of England by the violent Germany. Thus, the elements of the Third World War (atomic weapons) again revealed the coming of spring, just like the small-scale testing of aircraft at the end of the First World War, revealing the news of the large-scale bombing of the Second World War.

Churchill imagined the desolate film of the ruins of England in his mind at the beginning of the Second World War and hesitated infinitely, then what will the light of the atomic war be like? Hiroshima and Nagasaki have already practically directed it twice. The small-scale test is already like this, let alone a large scale? According to Western news, the atomic weapons that have been successfully developed in the past three years are no longer worth mentioning compared to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. The authority of science and the doomsday of the earth have a "happy meeting" momentum.
