### Foreign Minister Wang's Report on the Recent International Situation at the Council Meeting: Striving to Revive the World Economy and Prevent the Resurgence of Militarism; We Are Determined to Overcome the Current Crisis

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Standing Committee of the National Political Council held a routine meeting on the morning of the 13th, chaired by Jiang Yong. The meeting was of a confidential nature and invited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to report on the recent international situation and diplomacy. Subsequently, the following proposals were discussed: (1) Zheng Kuiyi et al. proposed that the salaries of faculty and staff in national colleges and universities be equalized. A resolution was passed to request the government to consider and implement it. (2) Xue Mingjian et al. proposed that the government pay attention to the processing of Taiwan's native products to increase foreign exchange earnings. A resolution was passed to request the government to pay close attention to it. (3) The same proposers proposed that the government clarify electoral administration, hoping that the government could maintain the independence of the judiciary, handle matters in accordance with the law, and not exert pressure through political force. A resolution was passed to request the government to pay close attention to it.

Foreign Minister Wang's report at the Council meeting was subsequently published in writing. The full text is as follows:

(1) Peace Treaty with Japan and World Economic Recovery: China has always longed for and strived for the early conclusion of a peace treaty because the early realization of world peace can help the world economy return to normal as soon as possible. However, since successive foreign ministers' meetings failed to reach an agreement, the hope for an early conclusion of peace treaties with Germany and Japan has dimmed. We should not abandon the desire to complete the European and Far Eastern peace treaties. However, to argue that economic recovery should be discussed only after there is peace is also a waste of time. Regarding the recovery of the world economy, China not only supports any plan to restore the losses of the Allied countries but also hopes to see the economic recovery of the enemy countries. However, all plans to restore the economy of the enemy countries must be able to ensure that militarism will not be revived. World peace is indivisible, and the world's economic recovery is equally indivisible.

(2) U.S. Aid to China: This matter is currently under consideration by the U.S. government. Regarding this matter, I believe that the ten self-help plans announced by Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan and approved by the State Council must be implemented as much as possible. Those that can be implemented without waiting for foreign aid should be implemented immediately. Only by earnestly implementing this plan can China's economy achieve self-reliance through self-help. Indeed, the difficulties China faces today are as serious as those during the most difficult period of the War of Resistance. The National Government overcame those difficulties at that time. We should uphold the same determination and belief to overcome the current major crisis.

Kowloon City and Shameen Cases: China and Britain Discuss Appropriate Solutions

(3) Siamese Coup: When the coup occurred in Siam last year, our government decided to temporarily postpone recognition of the new Siamese regime to observe the extent to which the Siamese people supported the new regime. Our adoption of this attitude is merely following a universally recognized international practice. At the same time, our government's policy of absolute non-interference in Siam's internal affairs will never publicly or secretly support or oppose any Siamese political groups. Our government has not only instructed its ambassadors and consular officials stationed in Siam to abide by this principle but has also, to the best of their ability, persuaded Chinese expatriates to avoid participating in Siam's domestic political struggles. We have suffered greatly from the various plots of Japanese government officials to interfere in China's internal affairs before the war. We are determined not to impose on others what we do not want for ourselves. Our government is closely monitoring the evolution of the situation in Siam.

(4) Kowloon City Incident and Shameen Incident: Regarding the Kowloon City incident, the Chinese and British governments have both proposed solutions and are currently discussing them with each other. I firmly believe that in seeking a just solution, the Chinese government's legal position and the public health concerns of the Kowloon Leased Territory authorities should be fully considered. As for the Shameen incident, both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior have sent personnel to Guangdong for investigation. The report will be submitted to the Ministry soon, and our government will discuss an appropriate solution to this incident with the British side based on the report.

### Allocation Guidelines for Import Quotas for the Fifth and Sixth Seasons Announced Yesterday; Fertilizers, Coal, Rice, Wheat, etc. Changed to Approval on a Case-by-Case Basis

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The examination team of the National Economic Council completed the examination of the import quotas for the fifth and sixth seasons on the morning of the 13th. The quota allocation table was originally scheduled to be announced at 3:00 PM on the 13th, but it was postponed because it still needed to be approved by the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 14th. However, the key points of the quota allocation were announced by Gu Yuchuan, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, at 5:00 PM on the 13th. The full text is as follows:

"Regarding the quotas for the import of goods into our country from foreign countries in the fifth and sixth seasons, the Export Management Committee of the Executive Yuan has carefully considered them. On the one hand, it is to cooperate with the national budget, and on the other hand, it must take into account factory production. A preliminary allocation table has been drawn up and submitted to the National Economic Council for deliberation on the 12th. In principle, it was approved, and eight members, including Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Weng Wenhao, Huo Shishu, Jie Guansan, and Lou Tongsun, and Deputy Secretary-General Gu Yuchuan were appointed to make the final revisions. A review meeting was held on the morning of the 13th, chaired by Vice President Wang. After carefully reviewing the ten-point statement of economic and financial self-help issued by Premier Zhang and the principles of increasing production and saving consumption, the results of the review have been reported to Chairman Zhang, and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation so that domestic manufacturers have a sufficient period to plan their own plans. The newly revised allocation table mentioned above has the following changes compared with the original one: (1) In the past, a quota was set for each season. Now, in order to cooperate with the national budget, it has been changed to a combined quota for two seasons (i.e., half a year). (2) The content of the newly revised allocation table does not include cotton from the fourth quarter onwards. Now, fertilizers, coal, rice, wheat, etc. have all been changed to not include quotas and will be approved on a case-by-case basis depending on the needs. (3) The original quota for small cars in the fourth quarter was 500 vehicles. Because the number of vehicles arriving at the port is considerable, the government has formulated other handling methods. The proposed quota for the fifth and sixth seasons is 500 vehicles, which will still not be given foreign exchange according to previous examples. (4) The original quota for metal products in the fourth quarter was US$4.5 million. Now, the total quota for the fifth and sixth seasons is set at US$7 million. Although it seems to be reduced by US$1.1 million per season, the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau and the Post-War Enterprise Committee still have a considerable amount of surplus US military materials that can be used, and there are considerable restrictions on the export of metal products from foreign countries. (5) The original quota for medicines in the fourth quarter was US$600,000. Now, the total quota for the fifth and sixth seasons is US$400,000, a reduction of US$800,000. Because US aid medicines will be shipped to China one after another, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) supplies of medicines owned by the Health Commission of the Executive Yuan, worth more than US$10 million, have been distributed one after another. Therefore, the current quota is based on the supply of raw materials for pharmaceutical manufacturing. (6) Paper and pulp will be imported in accordance with the regulations of the National Economic Council, with more finished paper products being imported and more pulp being imported to provide raw materials for paper mills to increase production and gradually reduce the import of domestically manufactured paper. (7) Tobacco leaves are generally considered to be purely consumer goods. In the current difficult social situation, it is especially important to strive to save consumption, and there is also domestic production. Therefore, the quota is reduced. Overall, the newly revised import allocation quota table for the fifth and sixth seasons seems to have been reduced significantly on the surface. If the various items not listed in the quota are combined, the reduction is very small compared with the original quota for the fourth quarter. At present, my country's foreign exchange is in difficulty, and we have to live within our means. I believe that all manufacturers will understand this. Although international aid in negotiations is very optimistic, we cannot rely entirely on foreign aid. Even if friendly countries provide a large amount of aid, we should still strive to save and increase the source of foreign exchange. During the implementation period of the import quotas for the fifth and sixth seasons, the import quotas will be approved on a case-by-case basis as needed, according to the importance and urgency, in order to benefit both the national economy and people's livelihood."

### Of the Imported Industrial Products, More Raw Materials Should Be Imported

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The review meeting of the National Economic Council on the quota for the fifth and sixth seasons has fully allocated and approved the quotas on the 13th. The total amount for the two seasons is US$74.72 million, with an average of US$37.36 million per season, which is about 30% less than the quota of US$53 million for the fourth quarter. In this allocation table, diesel oil has the largest figure, with a total of US$18 million. Because diesel oil is needed in many places such as ships, automobiles, and industry, it is only reduced by US$50,000 compared to the quota for the fourth quarter. The quota for gasoline has been reduced compared to the past. The original gasoline quota for the fourth quarter was US$2.97 million, and the two seasons have now been reduced to US$2.5 million per season. However, the quota for civil aviation gasoline will not be reduced, and it is only specially hoped that gasoline for automobiles in large cities should be saved especially. The quota for kerosene has been slightly reduced compared to the past. The quota for tobacco leaves in the fourth quarter was US$5 million, which has now been changed to US$8 million for the two seasons. The white paper for the fifth season is equal to the fourth quarter, still at US$4.5 million. The amount for the sixth season has not yet been approved, and the figure will be approved after considering the increase in domestic newspaper production. Wang Yunwu once proposed that the quota for newspapers should be relaxed, but because the newspapers allocated in the fourth quarter have not been fully imported, the fifth season will remain the same as the fourth quarter for the time being, only without reducing the quota. The quota for small cars for the two seasons is a total of 500 vehicles, including the cars used by the personnel of the embassies and legations of various countries in China, which has been reduced by half compared to 500 vehicles for one season in the fourth quarter. The quota for trucks is listed as US$625,000 per season, and the accessories are also included, which is equivalent to more than 200 vehicles. The machine belt part is deleted. In addition, the quota for this firewood in the quota has been reduced compared to the past, and the use has also been restricted. Regarding the import of chemical products, it is stipulated that raw materials for production should be the main body, and finished products should be reduced. The quota for wool in the table has not been revised and has not increased or decreased compared to the fourth quarter. The reason is that the woolen fabrics made of wool can be used for military and police uniforms. In addition, the review meeting on the morning of the 13th also decided on the following three principles: (1) Among the non-quota imports, it is stipulated that instruments, books, and educational supplies will still maintain US$500,000 per season; (2) Among all kinds of imported industrial products, more raw materials should be imported to increase domestic production and should be allocated to factories first (less to exporters); (3) The import of fuels such as gasoline and diesel should be limited to public utilities.

### Kowloon City Hostel Completed During the Spring Festival

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 13th] Kowloon City, which has attracted much attention, still spent the Spring Festival in peace and quiet. The hostel built jointly by the residents of Guangzhou after the demolition of the entire city was completed during the Spring Festival. It is named "Kowloon City Residents' Joint Association of Bao'an County." More than a thousand tourists visited the hostel every day during the Spring Festival. Seeing the residents' distressed tents, suffering from hunger and cold, they could not help but silently donate money to comfort them. In addition, the representative Liu Ziliang was suddenly arrested by the Hong Kong side on New Year's Eve, causing a temporary commotion. People thought that a new incident had occurred, but he was released soon. As for the two representatives, Zhu and Liu, who are in prison, the 13th happened to be the first month of their imprisonment. In addition to sending representatives to visit and comfort them in prison, the residents also urged Guo Dehua to negotiate their release again.

### Zhang Junmai Talks About China's Politics and Finance in the United States

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 12th] Zhang Junmai, leader of the China Democratic Socialist Party, recently declared that China's one-party system is coming to an end forever. Although the Kuomintang is still the largest political party, other small parties will be able to obtain seats in the government, such as cabinet ministers. Speaking at the Chamber of Commerce here, Zhang said: If the Communist Party had not been lured by the Soviet Union to take over the Northeast, its flames would have been suppressed long ago. Although internal and external affairs are in progress, some political reforms, such as financial reform and control, stabilization of the currency system, and assistance to commerce and agriculture, will be implemented quickly. Zhang continued: Despite the contrary arguments and reports, China's friendship with the United States has not diminished at all. We have received much assistance and advice from the United States, and we are very grateful for this. China is proud to stand among the major countries in the world that oppose communism.

### Torrential Spring Rain in Mount Lu

### Legislative Yuan Delegation Returns Home, Arrives in Hong Kong by Ship and Will Arrive in Shanghai Today

The ship will sail to Shanghai tomorrow.

### U.S. Relief Funds for China Purchase Second Batch of Grain; State Department Notifies Embassy in China

[U.S. Information Service, Nanjing, 14th] The U.S. State Department today notified the Embassy in China regarding the use of the US$18.3 million appropriated by Congress on December 23 last year to increase U.S. relief assistance to China. More than US$15.5 million will be used to obtain wheat and rice, US$1 million will be used for medical supplies, and US$500,000 will be used for insecticides and grain seeds.

This fund will be included in the US$27.7 million originally stipulated. The funds are currently being handled by the Embassy's China Relief Committee in accordance with the relief agreement signed between the United States and China on October 27 last year. The majority of the US$27.7 million originally stipulated was used to purchase grain, a considerable amount of which has already arrived in China or is crossing the ocean to come here.

To improve the utilization of imported grain, the Chinese government has adopted a rationing system in the coastal urban centers. These efforts have made progress. In view of this, the U.S. State Department has approved that the majority of the newly allocated funds will be used to purchase wheat and rice again. Therefore, more than US$15 million will be used for this purpose, and it is expected that China will obtain another 19,000 tons of wheat and 48,000 tons of rice, including transportation costs. After all of these materials are shipped to China within the next three months, the U.S. food donation under the current relief plan will be 190,000 tons, of which 70,000 tons will be wheat, and the rest will be rice.

The Chinese government is expected to announce soon its plan to implement a food rationing system using these materials and other important food supplies. The plan will ensure that the populous coastal urban centers will receive an adequate minimum supply of food during the months of food panic in late winter and spring.

Another US$1 million in surplus funds is currently being held in custody pending further consideration. It is expected that gasoline and diesel will be imported to China to cooperate with another special program to promote the transportation of grain produced in China from surplus areas to areas where there is insufficient supply, and to use the existing transportation mechanisms more effectively to ensure the rapid and equal distribution of relief supplies. The details of this part of the program are still being discussed with the Chinese government, so the details of the planned transportation program will be announced at a later date.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Some financial experts said that the Chinese legal currency cannot be reorganized. The amount of legal currency issued is so large that any loan within the capacity of the country is not enough to restore its original value. Others said that the Chinese currency can be reorganized if it adopts a coin standard, such as a silver standard. However, this reorganization requires about 500 million ounces of silver, or even more than 500 million ounces. It is doubtful whether the U.S. has this amount. The United States currently has only about 100 million ounces of silver that is not designated for use and can be lent to China, which is like a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. According to what is known here, many bankers and other financial figures in China believe that adopting a silver standard is the only way to prevent currency devaluation. However, they did not specify where to get the silver.

### The City of Beiping Purchased 32.4 Billion Worth of Finished Products

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Before the old year, the National Bank entrusted national banks and bureaus to purchase finished products. The purchase has now ended. A total of 32.4 billion was spent on finished products in Beiping, of which coal accounted for 22.6 billion. Small industrial loans totaled 17.6 billion, and handicraft loans totaled 30 billion, which have not yet been fully lent out. The National Bank's purchase of finished products and loans this time did not cause significant stimulation to the financial market because the amount was not large.

### Chu Xichun Returns to Beiping and Says Baoding's Safety Can Be Guaranteed

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Ji Yuxi Chu Xichun returned to Beiping from Baoding at 4:00 PM on the 13th. According to reports, he exchanged opinions with representatives from the party, government, military, and civilian circles in Baoding. Although the provincial government cannot work in Baoding at present, its attention to Baoding has not diminished. It is currently studying a specific plan for military and political cooperation with Commander Chuan. All policies are based on military needs. If the military is confident, it will not be a problem for the provincial government to be in Beiping or Baoding. People from all walks of life in Baoding have understood this, and the cooperation between the party, government, military, and civilians is commendable. The safety of Baoding is definitely not a problem. Chu will continue to inspect Tianjin within days.

### Communist Bandits in the Zhunge'er Banner of Yimeng Have Been Completely Eliminated

[Our Gui Sui Dispatch, 13th] The Communist bandits in the Zhunge'er Banner of Yimeng have been completely eliminated by the National Army after being harassed by the Communist bandits for a while. However, the Communist bandits occupied the Shili Changtan area on the opposite bank of Hekou. This place has been the base of military and political personnel in Hekou County in recent years. The loss was great this time. The Pingjing Banner of Ulanqab League is peaceful. The Bailing Temple area in the banner is guarded by the National Army. The rumor that Outer Mongolia is building a highway to Bailing Temple is not true. Liu Wanchun, Commander of Southern Sui, recently returned to Sui from Helin. According to reports, Helingele, Toketo, and Liangcheng in Southern Sui are very peaceful recently.

### There Are No Signs of Advocating the Abolition of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] China and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty on August 21, 1937 (26th year of the Republic of China) for the purpose of good-neighborly relations. The last clause of the treaty stipulates that the validity period is five years. If one of the contracting parties believes that there is no need to continue, it shall notify the other party six months before the expiration date, otherwise it shall continue to be valid for two years. The treaty first expired in 1942 (31st year of the Republic of China) and has been extended twice since then. It will expire in August of this year. It is reported that although China and the Soviet Union are considering this issue, there are no signs of advocating the abolition of the treaty. The relations between China and the Soviet Union are still quite friendly. If neither party raises any objections by the 21st of this month, it will be extended for another two years. Sources revealed that advocating the abolition of the treaty would indicate a major change in the relations between the two countries. It is expected that neither China nor the Soviet Union will do this at this time, and the treaty will be automatically extended for another two years.

### Communist Troops Launched an Offensive in Northern Shenyang; National Army in Taonan Recaptured Shahe; Anshan Is Tense and the Steel Plant Has Been Shut Down

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 13th] After the bandits were defeated in Jinan, they launched an offensive in northern Shenyang on the morning of the 12th. There were more than 10,000 bandits who were harassing the area east and west of Shifosi, 40 kilometers north of Shenyang. On the 13th, the National Army was attacking them in the Wandao Terrace area, 25 kilometers northwest of Shenyang, and the area 35 kilometers north of Shenyang. The National Army in Taonan recovered Shahe on the 12th, and the siege of Sujiatun was lifted. However, the bandits increased their troops around Anshan, and the bandits south of Qianshan moved frequently, attempting to attack Anshan.

[Another Dispatch] The iron capital Anshan is tense. There was contact on the west and northwest sides on the afternoon of the 12th. Dense artillery fire was heard in the city.

[Another Dispatch] The isolated Laixi Coal Mine has recently significantly increased production, from 1,500 tons per day to 10,000 kilowatts of electricity. Because the line is blocked, it stopped supplying Shenyang, so production increased. The Shenyang-Tiehling Railway is interrupted, and employees are working calmly. The mine has abundant coal reserves.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The remnants of Lin's Ninth Column of bandits who were harassing the Daling River area of the Northern Ninglu Railway were chased by the National Army and began to retreat towards Goubangzi on the morning of the 12th. The war on that line has improved.

### Deng Wenyi Reports to Reporters on the Overall Situation of the War and Guarantees That This Year's Bandit Suppression Achievements Will Be Better Than Last Year's

[Our Report] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, and Deng Wenyi, Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, jointly hosted a reception at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 12:00 noon yesterday for the responsible persons of various Chinese and foreign newspapers in this city. Among those present were Pan Gongzhan, Chen Xun, Feng Youzhen, Wang Yunsheng, Zhao Heng, Zhan Wenhuh, and over thirty others. Director Dong first stood up to give a speech, introducing Director Deng Wenyi, and expressed the hope that the press in this city could have more contact with Mr. Deng in the future. The Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense will send several personnel to be stationed in Shanghai for a long period to release war news. Everything is being planned and arranged and is expected to be realized in the short term. After Mr. Dong's report, Mr. Deng immediately stood up amidst the applause and gave a detailed report on the overall situation of bandit suppression. He concluded his speech at around 2:00 PM. The full text of his speech is recorded as follows:

It has been almost two years since the Communist bandits, led by Li Xiannian's Central Plains Military Region, suddenly launched a rebellion in the spring of the year before last. In the past two years of suppressing bandits and saving the people, the National Army has experienced many extremely difficult and dangerous battles. The National Army suffered 500,000 casualties, including deaths and missing, while more than 1.3 million bandit troops were eliminated, roughly a ratio of one to three. Calculating the entire campaign, the National Army has indeed been victorious. This can be proven by the fact that the Communist bandits have been shouting "counter-offensive" and "general counter-offensive" since the summer of last year. What is the actual situation of the recent war? Here is a comprehensive review.

1.  Northeast Battlefield

Currently, the Northeast battlefield is the most important to all parties, and everyone is very worried about the safety of Shenyang. In fact, the bandit troops currently roaming in Liaoning and southern Liaoning consist of ten columns, totaling about 200,000 people. Apart from trying to cut off Shenyang's land and sea transportation supply lines, they do not have the strength to attack Shenyang. The attacks by small bandit units in the suburbs of Shenyang are merely disruptive in nature, because the strength of the National Army's troops near Shenyang exceeds that of the bandit troops. As long as the Communist bandits dare to challenge Shenyang, they can be defeated at any time. The National Army will never give up the Northeast. Its strategy is to firmly defend strategic strongholds such as Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, and Sipingjie, as the foundation for recovering the entire Northeast in the future. The war in the Northeast is a long-term and arduous one, and it needs the support of the whole country. However, the current situation is not as serious as outsiders claim.

2.  North China Battlefield

The strength of the Communist bandit Nie Rongzhen in North China is only six columns, less than 120,000 people. Nie Rongzhen has always been a commander who suffers defeats. He was lucky enough to capture Shijiazhuang last winter, but the battle to harass the Peiping-Tientsin-Baoding area in December failed again. In the Yanqing and Laishui-Mancheng areas of Chahar, they lost 30,000 people. Only the 32nd Division of the National Army suffered relatively large casualties, less than 4,000 people. The troops commanded by Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi are more than double the number of Communist bandits. The defenses of Peiping, Tientsin, Baoding, and various transportation lines have been strengthened. The recent sweeping operations are proceeding very smoothly. The war situation in North China will gradually improve from now on.

3.  Shanxi-Shaanxi Battlefield

The lair of the Communist bandits Mao Zedong and Zhu De is now in northern Shanxi, defended by less than 40,000 remnants led by He Long. Peng Dehuai has about 50,000 people in northern Shaanxi and has failed to return to Yan'an, failing to capture Qingjian after three attempts. Wang Zhen led about 30,000 people in southern Shanxi in response. Although they claim to have a total of 100,000 people, their strength is weak. Director Yan Xishan has more than enough strength to firmly defend Taiyuan. As long as the National Army launches a large-scale campaign, the defeat of the Communist bandits there will be easier than the progress of last year's Shaanxi and Shandong campaigns.

### Using Tanggu New Port to Strengthen North Coal South Transportation, The First Transportation Ship Sailed to Shanghai

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 13th] The realization of North Coal South Transportation at Tanggu New Port has been announced. After coal from Mentougou and Kailuan successively arrived at the new port, the first transportation ship, the “Yiguang” arrived at the new port on the 11th. On the 12th, the port used its self-generating electricity to load 1,500 tons of coal with its coal loading machine, which took only seven hours. The ship left the port on the 13th for Shanghai. This is the first sound of North Coal South Transportation via the New Port.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 13th] The current North Coal South Transportation is actively improving transportation technology issues. The first wharf of the Tianjin Tanggu New Port has been deepened to reach six meters, which can simultaneously berth six 3,000-ton ships. The coal loading machine at the second wharf has been repaired and can load 200-300 tons of coal per hour. The original railway branch lines have also been increased by one, and the coal storage has been expanded to store 20,000 tons of coal. In the future, the export of coal from Kailuan, Datong, and Mentougou will be even more convenient.

Editorial

### This Year Will Definitely Be Better Than Last Year!

"The plan for a year lies in spring." Now that the Spring Festival is over, the whole country is making plans for all political and business affairs this year. Let us first infer the trend of the military suppression of bandits this year based on the war situation report made by Director Deng of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense to the press in Shanghai yesterday and say: "This year will definitely be better than last year."

Speaking of bandit suppression, we must first admit that the government initially lost a move. Why? Because the government was broad-minded and overly believed in the untrustworthy Communist bandits. Because the government was initially constrained by General Marshall's mediation, it wishfully wanted to try the path of peaceful negotiation, and some politicians in the country also vigorously supported this, thinking that the Communist bandits were ultimately Chinese, or had humanity, or still knew patriotism, but they did not know they were being fooled. It was not until the Communist bandits blocked the road to peace that the government finally decided to suppress the rebellion. In military terms, it can be said that it was a late move and suffered a great loss.

However, it is not too late to mend the fold after a sheep is lost. In the past battles, the National Army captured the old nest of the Communist bandits in Yan'an, swept away the base of Chen Yi's bandit troops in the Yimeng Mountains, and recovered the "warehouse" in northern Jiangsu occupied by the Communist bandits, which has indeed yielded great gains. According to Director Deng's report, although the National Army suffered 500,000 casualties, including deaths and missing, in the arduous and dangerous struggle, it eliminated more than 1.3 million bandit troops, nearly a ratio of one to three. This is because although the bandit troops have the weapons of the Japanese invaders, although there are Japanese, Koreans, and Mongolians helping them, and although the Soviet Union is backing them, they ultimately violate the national consciousness and cannot muster the will to fight in their conscience. Moreover, the old cadres and veteran soldiers of the bandit troops are almost completely wiped out, and the new soldiers are often deceived and coerced to come, and their combat will is naturally even more depressed. In addition, the internal divisions and struggles of the Communist bandits are becoming more and more serious day by day. Most of the cadres are either being purged or are gradually wavering. On the National Army side, although morale was somewhat affected for a period of time due to the poisoning of the "political consultation" atmosphere and the stimulation of reorganizing the army and cutting officers, after the government decided to suppress the rebellion and fought hard for more than a year, the psychology of common hatred for the enemy in the troops became stronger and stronger day by day due to the lessons of blood and experience learned by the soldiers and the improvement of the bandit suppression strategy and tactics. The entire bandit suppression war will inevitably become smoother with the passage of time.

Due to the revitalization of the morale of the National Army, the importance and strengthening of local self-defense forces, and the gradual implementation of local politics, especially the rural land distribution work, in coordination with the military, we believe that the National Army's achievements in suppressing bandits will certainly be better this year than last year, as Director Deng said. Looking at the situation of each battlefield: we absolutely support the government's new strategy. At this stage, we must firmly defend the strongholds in the Northeast, and at the same time, we must protect the passages in North China and eliminate the entire area of Central and East China. We believe that the National Army will never give up the Northeast. The National Army must firmly defend the large strongholds in the Northeast, such as Changchun, Shenyang, Jilin, and Siping, as the foundation for recovering the entire Northeast in the future. In the mainland, General Fu Zuoyi is the most suitable person to be in charge of bandit suppression in North China. Under his command, the National Army will use its mobility to cooperate with progressive local politics and the people's self-defense forces. There will be no room for the Communist bandits to gain a foothold in North China, and we dare to predict that the major transportation lines departing from Peiping will be completely opened up in the near future. After the reorganization of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in East China and Central China, command will be unified, troops will be concentrated, and new tactics will be adopted to deal with the Communist bandits' conspiracies and tricks. At the same time, if we can better understand the hidden circumstances that most of the bandit troops are coerced rather than willing, and implement both suppression and appeasement, giving the Communist bandits a way to repent and rehabilitate themselves, then not only will Chen Yi's bandit troops on the border of Shandong and Jiangsu inevitably be cleared, but also the illusions of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's bandit troops running around and becoming bandits in the Dabie Mountains, Tongbai Mountains, Funiu Mountains, and Dahong Mountains will be shattered by the National Army. At present, the political center of the country is in the capital, and the economic center is in Shanghai. Ensuring the safety of Nanjing and Shanghai is equivalent to defending the heart of the country. And clearing the Communist bandits north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River, so that there is no gap for the Communist bandits to gain a foothold and harass on the entire area of this land, is the most urgent strategy for bandit suppression. And with this strategy, under the major premise of common belief between the government and the public and cooperation between the military and the people, we believe that it will be successfully completed.

We dare to say that this year will definitely be better than last year; at the same time, we earnestly hope that the government and the public will work harder this year than last year!

### On the National General Budget for This Year (Part 2)

Sixth is the issue of government domestic and foreign debt reorganization. Before the War of Resistance, debt expenditure accounted for approximately 30% or more of China's total fiscal expenditure. Part of this fiscal burden was the reparations left by the Manchu Qing government, and part was the domestic and foreign debts left by the Northern Warlord government era. In order to maintain China's national credit, our National Government still endured and bore this unreasonable burden. After the outbreak of the war, many new domestic and foreign debts were incurred, so the fiscal pressure of debt will make China's finances never sound.

According to the author's statistics, the principal and interest payable on public bonds in legal tender units from before the war to 1944, from 1948 to 1981, totaled 27.765539 billion yuan. During the same period, the principal and interest payable on public bonds in foreign currency and customs gold units, from 1948 to 1967, totaled approximately 3.761 trillion yuan (converted according to the Central Bank's foreign exchange rates). The two totaled approximately 3.8 trillion yuan. The following is a table:

1942 Allied Victory US Dollar Public Bond (from 1948 to 1953) US Dollar 82,000,000

In addition, the 1934 June British Gold Gengkuan Public Bond and the 1941 Yunnan-Burma Railway Gold Public Bond, issued by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with various ministries, have not yet been included. Summarizing the above various public bonds, the principal and interest payable on customs gold public bonds is 93,057,500 customs gold units, which is equivalent to 1.946115 billion yuan when converted at 20 yuan per customs gold unit. The principal and interest payable on British gold public bonds is 24,501,750 pounds, which is equivalent to 1.176 trillion yuan when converted at the Central Bank's rate of 48,000 yuan per pound; if converted at the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's rate of 413,000 yuan per pound, it would be 10.11922275 trillion yuan. The principal and interest payable on US dollar public bonds is 215,418,750 US dollars, which is equivalent to 2.585 trillion yuan when converted at the Central Bank's rate of 12,000 yuan per dollar; if converted at the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's rate of 131,500 yuan per dollar, it would be 28.327565625 trillion yuan.

According to the author's opinion, the purchase of public bonds during wartime should be treated equally, because the act of purchasing national currency unit or customs gold unit public bonds and purchasing foreign currency unit public bonds is originally the same in nature, but the principal and interest of national currency public bonds or customs gold unit public bonds are still paid according to the face value, which in fact has suffered considerable losses, while those who purchase foreign currency unit public bonds have not been affected by price increases. This is obviously extremely unfair. Therefore, the author suggests that the Ministry of Finance should base the repayment of principal and interest on foreign currency unit domestic public bonds on the Central Bank's exchange rate, and never on the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's rate. Although holders of foreign currency unit public bonds also suffer losses, the extent of their losses is definitely not as low as that of holders of national currency unit public bonds.

If the government really wants to repay British gold and US dollar public bonds based on the Central Bank's exchange rate, then from January 1948 to 1967, the payable principal and interest converted into legal tender would be 3.761 trillion yuan, which the government's treasury definitely has the power to repay in one go.

If the government wants to maintain the superficial credit of the country and implement repayment in new currency after currency reform, then it is firmly believed that such a huge amount of public debt will bankrupt the treasury, and the original intention to maintain the superficial credit of the country will result in the loss of the actual credit of the country! We must know that the soundness of national finances symbolizes the soundness of all aspects of the country's economy, politics, and culture, and also the welfare of the entire people. If we insist on maintaining debt credit and bankrupt the finances, it will not only be the misfortune of the country and the government, but also the misfortune of the entire nation. In particular, the burden of repaying the principal and interest of foreign currency year-end public bonds during wartime falls on the national treasury, and the national treasury cannot but increase taxes on the people, resulting in a greater imbalance in wealth distribution, which will cause drastic changes in social order. This is a short-sighted measure that is not suitable for the national economy and the people's livelihood!

The source of funds for repaying this type of domestic public debt is to be raised through prize-winning public bonds. As the author mentioned earlier, if the government implements a prize-winning public bond policy, it can receive 100 trillion yuan annually, which is sufficient to repay the above-mentioned principal and interest of public bonds in one go.

The author believes that if these sources of funds can be realized as desired, the budget table for this year will be as follows:

Design Table of the National General Budget for 1948 (Unit: 100 Million Yuan)

Expenditure Section (Full Year)

Trillion 100 Million

Military Expenditure 150,0000

Economic Construction Expenditure 75,0000

Living Expenses for Public and Educational Personnel 30,0000

Debt Expenditure 15,0000

Other Government Affairs Expenditure 30,0000 Trillion 100 Million

Total Expenditure 300,0000 Trillion

Revenue Section (Full Year) Zi, Tax Revenue

1.  Unified Industrial and Commercial Tax Revenue 30,0000

2.  Property Tax Revenue (Relief) 30,0000

3.  Military Service Tax and Corvée Tax 30,0000

4.  Other Taxes 30,0000

Chou, State-Owned Property Revenue

1.  Proceeds from the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Industries 100,0000 Trillion

2.  Other State-Owned Property Revenue 10,0000 Trillion

Yin, Japanese Reparations Revenue 100,0000 Trillion

Mao, Surplus Revenue from State-Operated Enterprises 10,0000 100 Million Trillion

Total Revenue 330,0000

According to the author's rough estimate, the total amount of national budget expenditure for the full year this year is 300 trillion yuan, but the sources of funds are 330 trillion yuan. If another 100 trillion yuan of prize-winning public bonds are issued, there will still be a surplus of 130 trillion yuan this year. This estimate is not exaggerated. In a victorious country, there is no need for financial difficulties to arise! If the government can truly understand the people's psychology and the people can cooperate with the government, then this budget will inevitably be realized. We see that during wartime in Britain and the Soviet Union, when wartime public bonds were issued, the people rushed to buy them, often as if they were crazy, and they were sold out completely in a few days. This heroic act inspired by patriotism is indeed worthy of our people's lessons and emulation.

The author's proposed property tax of 30 trillion yuan is based on the Nanjing telegram of January 14 in the Shenbao, in which Finance Minister Yu Hongjun announced his talk on "increasing the special relief donation of 30 trillion yuan." The author believes that this number is not excessive. Based on the current market price standard, it is only worth 200 million yuan of legal tender before the war; based on the pre-war US dollar, it is only 66 million US dollars. It must be known that the object of suppressing the rebellion today is the greatest enemy of the domestic minority of wealthy classes. If they still do not generously contribute at this time, it is tantamount to digging their own graves. It is hoped that the Ministry of Finance can make the greatest determination and smoothly raise this special relief donation!

Secondly, regarding the military service tax and corvée tax proposed by the author, the Ministry of Finance was ordered to draft measures during the War of Resistance. The author also participated in the design at that time and believed that in today's situation where our country's income tax system is not yet complete, it is necessary to implement this tax in order to help the finances overcome difficulties during wartime. This tax is similar to the Geng Fu system of the Han Dynasty in our country. Its main meaning is to contribute strength if you have strength and to contribute money if you have money, and to jointly assist the national defense. Today is an extraordinary period of suppressing the rebellion, and it is still necessary to propose this tax. The author believes that all male and female citizens of the Republic of China between the ages of 18 and 50 must pay military service tax and corvée tax to the national treasury every year. According to the author's rough estimate, the number of taxpayers nationwide, excluding bandit areas, is approximately 150 million people. If each person only needs to pay 11,000 yuan to the national treasury each month, there will be 20 trillion yuan annually. This burden can be borne by all the people of the country.

### Overall Battle Situation (Continued from page 1)

4.  The East China Theater

Chen Yi's activities reached a fever pitch last winter. The East China Field Army once grew to 300,000 men. But after the disastrous defeat in the Yimeng Mountains, followed by defeats in the Lu-Yu and Jiaodong campaigns, his subordinates secretly lamented, "Counter-offensive, counter-offensive, we lost Shandong." At that time, his strength was reduced by more than half. In the past six months, he has been gathering remnants, resting and reorganizing for a short time in Hebei. Now, combining Lusi, Jiaodong, and Northern Jiangsu, although the number of people has recovered to nearly 200,000, they are all new recruits, and their strength is not as good as before. They can only dodge and avoid battles everywhere. He wants to restore the situation in Shandong last year and support Liu Bocheng in establishing the Central Plains battlefield, but he lacks the strength and will ultimately fail.

5.  The Central China Theater

Liu Bocheng failed in Western Shandong last September. With nowhere to go, he carried the banner of the vanguard of the general counter-offensive southward, implemented the "hollow tactics" and the "three-seeking tactics," and adventurously advanced into the Dabie Mountains, robbing and looting everywhere to seek soldiers and food. He also instructed Chen Geng in the Taihang Mountains to bring two more columns to enter Western Henan as a flanking force, declaring "We crossed the Yellow River last year, and we will cross the Yangtze River this year." His plan could not withstand the pursuit, encirclement, suppression, and sweeping operations of the National Army from all directions. He thought that the tactic of "eliminating the militia and dragging down the National Army" was very effective, but now he knows that it is not the National Army that is running around in exhaustion, but the bandit army. The tens of thousands of northern peasants he brought along, who were coerced into joining, were unable to adapt to the climate and fled one after another. Now he is in a very embarrassing situation. Although his and Chen Geng's forces total more than 120,000 in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, the Dabie Mountain base cannot be established, and Chen Yi's support and supply are limited. It can be said that the future of Liu and Chen's bandits is very bleak.

6.  The Fatal Wounds of the Communist Bandits

The total number of Communist bandits' soldiers in the country, including the Northeast, has exceeded one million, but he himself has three fatal wounds: First, these millions of farmers who were forced to join the armed forces were deceived and coerced. Given the opportunity, especially after fierce battles during long marches, they fled one after another or defected to the National Army. Second, in the past two years, 70% of the old cadres and veterans of the past Communist Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army have been eliminated in various battles. The majority of the new cadres and new recruits cannot endure the suffering of long-term and long-distance wandering, and their will and spirit to fight are very depressed. Third, the Communist bandits have recently accepted international orders to maintain the purity of their party and army in order to consolidate their internal affairs. Following the past rectification movement, they are carrying out a review movement and a widespread purge movement, investigating class, ideology, and bloodlines. As a result of internal division and struggle, most of the cadres are shaken. These points are the fatal wounds of the bandits and the main reasons why their power has expanded to the peak and cannot be further developed.

7.  Progress in the National Army's Suppression of Bandits

In the past, due to the National Government's policy of peace and political solutions, it was initially not prepared for the Communist bandits' total rebellion. It can also be said that it was not prepared to suppress the bandits, so in the past two years, the National Army did not fully understand the Communist bandits' conspiracies, tricks, and tactics on the battlefield, and suffered some losses. However, due to the bloody lessons and experiences of the past two years, and more importantly, the relationship between the survival of the nation, the people, and the country itself, the psychology of common hatred for the enemy is becoming stronger day by day. People in various places have also spontaneously armed themselves to assist the National Army in combat, and the tactics of suppressing bandits are improving day by day. It is not easy for the Communist bandits to take advantage of loopholes again. In addition, the newly trained fresh troops of the National Army still exceed the Communist bandits three to five times in quantity and quality. As long as political coordination with the military and support from the rear for the front line are strengthened, the National Army's achievements in suppressing bandits this year can be guaranteed to be better than last year, and at the same time, it is not difficult to foresee that the Communist bandits' failure this year will be even more miserable than last year.

The old system of replacing tax labor originated from the household tax of the Qin Dynasty and was followed by successive dynasties until the Qing Dynasty. Its names include head tax, household levy, head money, poll tax, head tax money, head levy, head silver, head calculation, and calculation levy. Although the names are different, the nature is the same. In the early Han Dynasty, people aged five to fifty-six paid a tax of 120 coins per person per year, which was called a calculation. This is the so-called head tax. The Han Dynasty's replacement tax labor system had three categories: regular military service, base civil service, and purchase labor. In ancient times, there were no permanent soldiers, and everyone took turns, one month at a time, which was regular military service. Those who were poor and wanted to obtain replacement money could pay the next person in line to replace them, 2,000 coins per month, which was base civil service. Everyone in the world had to garrison the border for three days, which was also called replacement labor, or "stationing." Those who did not go had to pay 300 coins to the government, which the government used to pay those who were stationed. This was called purchase labor. From this, it can be seen that this was the ancient national defense financial policy of our country. We are not advocating restoring the past, but collecting a small amount of tax similar to the replacement tax labor may not be a fair financial policy during this extraordinary period. Since the armed comrades on the front lines are defending the country with their lives in the icy and snowy weather, the people in the rear should at least provide them with material and spiritual assistance. In this way, the loyalty of all the people and armed comrades to the country can be balanced. Today, I hear that some people in the rear of the war line often complain about the government and criticize the government because of economic difficulties, and even slander the government. This is like the lament of a part of the traitors during the Anti-Japanese War that the government should not fight against Japan. They believed that the National Government's move from Nanjing to Hankou to Chongqing meant that China would be ruled by Japan, so they flocked to beg for mercy from Japanese imperialism, willing to be its lackeys and puppets. These Chinese dregs and national traitors, who had no patriotism or revolutionary spirit, did not understand the ultimate effect of the National Government's leadership of the long-term resistance war and the exertion of revolutionary forces until after their death or imprisonment. Although their despicable actions did not damage the overall life of the country, it should be known that their despicable actions actually increased the burden on the National Government's war effort. This is because their existence caused a lot of trouble on our country's ideological and economic war lines. Today, the campaign to suppress bandits and quell the chaos is related to the survival of the nation and the country, just like the Anti-Japanese War, so it is not allowed for some people not to do their best for the country and contribute their money.

Finally, the author concludes as follows: The national budget for this year has already begun. Now, the National Government must concentrate its efforts to make it a financial effort to complete the quelling of the chaos and building the country. In other words, the five major systems of the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Examination Yuan under the National Government must work together to try their best to increase financial resources on the one hand, and try their best to control waste on the other. For example, to solve the problem of enemy and puppet property in state-owned property, the Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan must closely cooperate to complete their goal of increasing the treasury's income from the sale of enemy and puppet property by at least 100 trillion yuan in this year in the fastest and most effective way. For example, in order to thoroughly solve the problem of the heads of the treasury system of government agencies at all levels and the personnel who directly manage cash, the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Examination Yuan must cooperate with each other. On the one hand, they must strive to improve the quality of personnel in the personnel system, and on the other hand, they must step up the prevention of the occurrence of fraudulent phenomena. In particular, the ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan must cooperate closely and give full play to the spirit of division of labor and cooperation. For example, if a replacement tax labor is collected, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Interior must cooperate to achieve perfect results. Although constitutional government is about to begin, during this extraordinary period, we must not focus our attention on constitutional issues and put the most urgent work of war chaos in a slow picture.

At the same time, the financial authorities must deeply understand the close relationship between finance and currency. In order to keep the budget and final accounts from having huge discrepancies, we must first stabilize market prices. In order to stabilize market prices, we must first absorb the floating capital roaming in the market. In order to absorb the floating capital in the market, we must first give full play to the original functions of the bank. Therefore, in addition to the Ministry of Finance directly issuing lottery bonds and entrusting the Central Trust Bureau to issue traitorous savings prize coupons, we must order the seven major national financial institutions to concentrate their efforts and use all appropriate methods to absorb fixed deposits and savings deposits, and use the preferential interest rate of the time before currency reform to accelerate the absorption of deposits, thereby controlling the purchasing power of the people.

In addition, improving the treatment of civil and military officials and armed comrades is the basis for solidifying the revolutionary forces of the National Government. In this way, administrative efficiency and fighting spirit can be brought into play. The financial authorities must pay special attention to this point.

In short, man proposes and God disposes. There is no reason to be pessimistic about this year's budget, and all pessimistic phenomena are created by mediocre people. However, since it is a phenomenon made by people, it can be overcome by human forces.

### Early Implementation of the Marshall Plan: The United States Urges Cooperation in Western Europe. Meeting of Sixteen European Nations to Reconvene

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 13th (Broadcast): Washington dispatch: A State Department spokesman stated that the United States has agreed to participate in another meeting of the sixteen nations in the European Recovery Program to discuss the needs of recovery. The time will be roughly at the end of this month, and the location may still be Paris.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] Responsible parties have confirmed the news from the United States that a meeting of sixteen nations will be convened in March, but the date has not yet been determined. Britain and France will be the inviting countries and will consult with the other fourteen nations on the European Recovery Program. However, the report of the sixteen nations, which is the basis for estimating the cost of European reconstruction, will not be discussed at this meeting.

[Reuters, Paris, 12th] The British and French governments are currently inquiring with the other fourteen European nations whether it is appropriate to reopen the meeting of sixteen nations to discuss the Marshall Plan. A few days ago, the British and French ambassadors to the United States discussed this matter with the State Department. As a result, the three parties agreed in principle that there is a need to hold another meeting of sixteen nations. The matters to be considered by the new meeting are two: (1) establishing a permanent sixteen-nation organization; (2) studying the continued development of economic cooperation among European countries. The conditions for American aid to Europe will not be included in the agenda.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The State Department no longer opposes the early reopening of the meeting of sixteen European nations on the Marshall Plan, but stated that the reopening date has not yet been determined. The change in the U.S. attitude has been notified by Deputy Secretary of State Lovett to British Minister Balfour and has been conveyed to France. U.S. officials still hope that after the meeting is reopened, they can avoid points of contention and focus on European economic cooperation, the establishment of a permanent organization for the meeting, and review the achievements that have been completed since the end of the Paris meeting last summer, which are the tasks to be done in the future. The United States deeply wants to avoid public expressions of fear of the conditions attached by the United States by other parties. This expression will show a lack of unity in Europe, thus increasing the difficulties in Congress. Another reason for the change in the State Department's attitude is the smooth progress of the European Recovery Program in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A portion of the bill passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which was announced yesterday, not only urges European countries to engage in cooperation and quickly establish a permanent economic cooperation organization, but also does not attach any conditions other than those voluntarily accepted by one European country. It can be seen that the Foreign Relations Committee and other agencies of Congress are willing for the European side to start working under the European Recovery Program immediately.

[Reuters, Boston, 12th] New York Governor Dewey, who may be a Republican presidential candidate, delivered a speech here tonight, advocating that the sixteen Western European countries receiving U.S. aid should conclude a military alliance.

### European Countries Accepting U.S. Aid Must Comply with Six Conditions: Resolution by U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee resolved today that countries accepting assistance under the Marshall Plan must comply with certain conditions if they wish to continue receiving U.S. aid. The proposed bill passed by the committee authorizes the President to terminate assistance to countries that fail to fulfill their promises of self-help and economic cooperation, or when the assistance provided by the United States conflicts with U.S. national interests. The committee also stipulates that countries receiving assistance must agree to (1) increase the production of coal, iron, steel, and food; (2) improve their transportation systems; (3) stabilize their currencies; (4) guarantee full access to information regarding the use of U.S. aid; (5) list accounts in local currencies equal to the amount of U.S. aid; and (6) exchange the sale of materials as a standard to transfer strategic materials to the United States.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg declared today that the committee has unanimously agreed that European countries must do their best to help themselves and each other if they want to obtain U.S. aid. The committee is making the Marshall Plan into a bill to be submitted to the Senate for a vote, believing that the sixteen European countries that want to obtain U.S. aid must implement guarantees and formulate a common recovery plan based on self-help and mutual cooperation. Each country must sign an agreement with the United States to seek its own recovery and keep its promises without change.

If any country fails to do its best or does not use U.S. aid for the intended purpose, U.S. executives will be ordered to stop the aid. If the situation changes or there is no need to continue, the executive can also stop providing assistance. This last clause can be invoked when a country is controlled by the Communist Party, stopping U.S. assistance. Although the bill strictly stipulates that U.S. aid cannot be used for other purposes, it does not exclude European countries' colonies. According to what Vandenberg told reporters, the United States hopes to obtain strategic raw materials from the colonies to repay part of the dollars and supplies it allocated, so it pays special attention to the colonies of European countries.

### Spaak Speaks Freely on Belgium's Foreign Policy: Supports Bevin's Plan

[Reuters, Brussels, 12th] Belgian Prime Minister Spaak spoke freely to the Foreign Relations Committee of the Parliament about Belgium's position in the international arena. According to the official statement, after Spaak explained the reasons for Belgium's support of the principles declared by Foreign Minister Bevin, he outlined the principles necessary to obtain the support of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, including the need to solve the problem of West Germany in cooperation with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Spaak firmly expressed his hope that the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg could participate on an equal footing in the meeting on the German problem to be held by Britain, the United States, and France in London. Spaak continued, the agreement formed by the Soviet Union and its neighboring satellite countries can only promote the formation of a Western group similar to it. When there is already an organization in Eastern Europe, the West must not be without an organization. The cooperation between Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg is by no means the beginning of an aggressive policy. This agreement only has mutual aid significance. This mutual aid will be a comprehensive cooperation including economic, political, and military affairs. Stalin once expressed his support for this agreement. Spaak said, although the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have a common policy, each country will still maintain its individual rights within the framework of this common policy. Finally, Spaak said that the Dunkirk Treaty between Britain and France has already been expanded, and it is indeed necessary to establish a broader agreement. The Belgian Parliament's Foreign Relations Committee then passed support for Spaak's remarks, only the Communist Party members did not express their opinions.

### Sino-American High School to University: Presents New Plan

Suggests Peaceful Resolution of International Disputes

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 13th (Broadcast): Lake Success dispatch: Today, China and the United States jointly submitted a formal proposal to the United Nations Small General Assembly to solve international disputes. The proposal advocates settling on an approach to eliminate differences before disputes are submitted to the Security Council and the General Assembly.

### South Korean Communist Party Agitates for General Strike

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 13th] The Central Committee of the South Korean Communist Party today implemented a general strike, its call to action containing the phrase "Strike until final victory." The main purpose of this strike is to protest the actions of the United Nations Commission and the division of Korea. According to the first call for a general strike, issued on February 7th to "all Korean patriotic patriots," workers are simply asked to lay down their tools. The new call emphasizes opposition to "the holy war-like peaceful nature of foreign imperialism" and demands the withdrawal of the United Nations Commission and foreign occupation forces. It concludes, "We oppose the separate election in South Korea. The time for empty talk is past. Today we must act." At the same time, sporadic riots and strikes have taken place in various provinces. In the area of Pu Lu (transliteration), there was a clash between farmers and police, with fourteen farmers injured.

### The Soviet Union Already Possesses Giant Aircraft
More Effective Than Superfortresses

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Republican Congressman Merlo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the Soviet Union has a large number of giant bombers that are more effective than American Superfortresses. He believes that air superiority is the only language that some nations can understand. If I had to choose between air superiority and the European Recovery Program, I would choose the former.

### Soviet Occupation Zone in Germany Announces Establishment of Economic Commission to Compete with British and American Zones

[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] Soviet Military Government Chief Sokolovsky today ordered the establishment of an economic commission for the Soviet zone in Germany, with a permanent chairman and representatives from the zone government's labor, agriculture, and other departments serving as members. This institution is the counterpart to the economic commission in the British and American merged zone in Frankfurt, and its establishment was not unexpected by people here. Since the announcement of the charter for the British and American merged zone on February 6th, Soviet-controlled newspapers have repeatedly foreshadowed this.

### Streamlining Administration

[Reuters, Berlin, 12th] It is reported that the Soviet occupation authorities have established a committee to review personnel and organizational matters of various German central institutions in the Soviet zone. According to the committee chairman, Steiner, the committee's work must be completed by March 15th, and the results may lead to changes in the German central administrative institutions in the Soviet zone. Steiner also stated that this move is aimed at simplifying administration and is not intended to establish a central government similar to the one in the British and American merged zone.

### US Policy Toward Germany: The Ruhr and Rhineland

Advocates Continued Control by Occupation Authorities

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The House Foreign Aid Selection Committee released a report today, stating that Germany's neighboring countries have good reason to fear the resurgence of German industrial capacity. It also believes that a democratic Germany based on a free economic system is the best guarantee of peace in Europe. The report also believes that France's proposal to politically separate the Ruhr and Rhineland from Germany and place them under international supervision is difficult to implement. There are also significant doubts about the British Trades Union Congress's suggestion to nationalize Ruhr coal mines and factories to prevent future military or economic aggression. The compromise is to keep the Ruhr and Rhineland as part of Germany politically and economically, and to establish new companies to operate and hold the basic factories and mines in the Ruhr area. German public and private capital as well as foreign capital will have the opportunity to participate in these new companies. The operation policy and finances of the Ruhr mines should be supervised by a committee composed of the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan, plus the United States and the future German government. However, the three occupying powers of Britain, the United States, and Germany should have greater voting rights in the international committee. During the transitional period, the Ruhr and Rhineland should continue to be under the control of the British and American merged zone authorities.

### New US Chief of Staff Plans to Inspect the Far East

[United Press, Washington, 12th] US Chief of Staff General Bradley, if permitted by the Department of Defense to travel, plans to visit the Philippines, Japan, and Korea for three days each this summer or fall.

### No Progress in Japanese Politics: Three Parties Oppose Shigeru Yoshida's Appointment as New Prime Minister; Tetsu Katayama May Form a Cabinet Again

[Reuters, Tokyo, 13th] The secretaries-general of Japan's four major political parties held a meeting yesterday to select a new prime minister. Negotiations stalled due to the Liberal Party's insistence that its leader, Shigeru Yoshida, be appointed prime minister, which was opposed by the other three parties. Although the meeting continued today, the hope of an agreement is slim. Shigeru Yoshida continues to oppose the formation of a coalition cabinet, and newspapers predict that the Liberal Party will take independent action and become an opposition party if it fails to form a cabinet. Former Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama told the press that he supports the formation of a coalition cabinet.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Judging from the current situation, the establishment of the second Katayama cabinet is highly likely, because the leaders of the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party cannot work together and have failed to obtain support from other parties to form a coalition cabinet that can control the majority in the parliament. Therefore, the only trend is for Tetsu Katayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, to form a cabinet again. The left and right wings of the Socialist Party have now realized the necessity of restoring party unity. Suzuki Mosaburo, the leader of the party's left wing, stated this afternoon that he is willing to resign from his position on the House Budget Committee. The committee rejected the government's proposed supplementary budget, which led to the collapse of the cabinet.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Prime Minister Katayama, before leaving for his villa in Katase, Kanagawa Prefecture, for recuperation on the 12th, told reporters, "Judging from the current political situation in Japan, I am afraid that a central coalition cabinet will have to be formed. Even if it is unstable, there is no other way. Because I had no confidence in managing the political situation, I resigned. Therefore, who will be the next prime minister is unknown, and everything should be freely decided by the parliament."

[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] Outgoing Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama left Tokyo for his seaside private residence near Yokohama on the 13th for recuperation. However, observers say that if the stalemate continues, the possibility of Katayama forming a cabinet again will greatly increase.

### Five Eastern European Countries Study Plan to Develop Resources in Danube Basin, Revitalize Agriculture and Industry, and Eliminate Tax Barriers

[Central News Agency, Prague, 12th, United Press] According to well-informed diplomatic sources, five Eastern European Soviet satellite states are studying a plan to develop the fertile Danube River Basin. Hungary and Yugoslavia are the leaders of this plan, and Romania and Bulgaria are fully cooperating. The Hungarian ambassador to France, Karolyi, has come here to consult with the Czech authorities on this matter. This plan includes: (1) Establishing a small Tennessee Valley Authority power plant to generate electricity using the Danube River and its tributaries. (2) Dredging and utilizing inland waterways for transportation to reduce transportation costs and control floods. (3) Increasing the volume of trade in agricultural and mineral products. (4) Expanding industrial facilities. This plan may also discuss the elimination of tariff barriers and will be coordinated with the five countries' long-term economic plans and the bilateral trade agreements signed between the five countries. The above-mentioned agreements may lead to a comprehensive multilateral agreement among the five countries.

### Lost in Snowstorm: Turkish Plane Shot Down by Bulgaria

[Reuters, Ankara, 12th] Turkish aviation experts say that the two Spitfire aircraft shot down by Bulgaria on the Bulgarian-Turkish border were lost in a snowstorm. The two aircraft came from Atria-Hopal. Due to the bad weather and poor visibility, they could not be controlled near the Bulgarian border and therefore got lost. The fact that the two aircraft circled over Ansu-Bupir proves that they were looking for a way back. According to Bulgarian statements, the weather was very good when the Turkish aircraft flew into Bulgarian territory.

### Britain and Argentina Sign New Trade Agreement

[United Press, Buenos Aires, 13th] Britain and Argentina negotiated a new trade agreement for eleven weeks and formally signed it last night. It stipulates that Britain can obtain 440,800 tons of beef and over 1.25 million tons of maize for livestock feed, and export non-major products such as animal and vegetable oils worth at least 40 million US dollars. In addition, it should sell steel, tinplate, asbestos, medicines, whiskey, wool, textiles, and automobiles to Argentina. Argentina, on the other hand, will obtain 12,000 miles of railway, which is Britain's largest investment in South America. The total price is 600 million US dollars in cash. Argentina also guarantees to ship 1 million tons of coal and 16,179 barrels of kerosene.

### Einstein Receives "One World" Prize

[Reuters, New York, 12th] It was announced here today that Professor Einstein will receive the "One World" Prize, a free trip around the world. This prize was established in memory of the late Republican leader Wendell Willkie.

### Change of British Ambassador to the United States: Sir Franks to Succeed; Enthusiastic Welcome from US Government and Public

[Reuters, London, 12th] Sir Franks has been appointed as the British Ambassador to the United States, succeeding Lord Inverchapel (formerly Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who has served as ambassador to China and the Soviet Union), who has resigned from diplomatic service. Franks was a professor of philosophy at the University of Glasgow. At the outbreak of the war, he joined the Ministry of Supply and was later promoted to Deputy Secretary. When sixteen European countries held a meeting in Paris to discuss the Marshall Plan, Franks served as the chief British representative and was elected chairman of the European Economic Cooperation Committee. He then led the British delegation to Washington to participate in the European Recovery negotiations. Sir Franks is 42 years old and is currently the Principal of Queen's College, Oxford.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The US government and public have expressed a warm welcome to Franks's appointment as British Ambassador to the United States. Franks's appointment to this position indicates Britain's emphasis on the Marshall Plan and Britain's sincere support for the interests and principles of the European Recovery Plan. Foreign Secretary Bevin originally wanted an ambassador who could continue to serve in Washington throughout the implementation of the Marshall Plan.

Stabbing a Man in the Back When He Is in Danger

No effort made by one government to prevent another from entering the war has been more sincere than our efforts to prevent Italy from entering the war. For five months before Mussolini joined the war, we appealed to him and exerted pressure.

On April 20th, Taylor sent me two telegrams to forward to the President. In one telegram, he said that there was a real danger of Mussolini joining Hitler's side or launching aggression alone in new areas. He quoted the words of the Vatican's Foreign Minister Maglione, urging the President to take action within two or three days, preferably immediately. In another telegram, Taylor quoted the Pope's words, urging the President to send a telegram to Mussolini immediately. The Pope said that at that time he would take parallel action and cooperate.

After receiving these two telegrams, I notified the President, who was at the Warm Springs in Georgia at the time. He felt that after expressing himself to Mussolini twice (once through our ambassador and once through Welles), he had said enough. Checking the telegrams sent to the President from many capitals, we believed that Mussolini's actions would be launched in a few days.

But on April 26th, Taylor telegraphed again, saying that he had met again with the Pope and Foreign Minister Maglione, who reiterated their previous suggestions. Taylor reported the Vatican's belief that Mussolini was likely to take sudden action, especially because he had to act quickly to overcome the forces at home that opposed entering the war, as rumored outside.

On Sunday, April 28th, the President returned to Washington. I read Taylor's telegrams with him and told him that the British and French governments were also worried that Mussolini would enter the war by force. So the President decided that he should send an appeal to Mussolini, this time in written form.

The drafting of the message was completed that afternoon (April 29th), and telegraphed to Mussolini that night.

The next day, Taylor telegraphed to the President that the Pope, true to his previous suggestion of parallel action, had sent a handwritten message directly to Mussolini.

Mussolini met with Phillips on May 1st and praised the President's message to him. He said that Germany could not be defeated and that European peace could not be considered without recognizing the new geographical situation created by Hitler's conquests. As for Italy, he said that its "imprisonment in the Mediterranean" could not be tolerated and denounced Britain's possession of the Suez Canal and Gibraltar.

Mussolini's verbal remarks to Phillips were actually much milder than Mussolini's written reply to the President, which was sent to the White House by Ambassador Colonna on May 2nd.

Several days later, Phillips telegraphed me that he had seen Foreign Minister Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, who told him that Britain's decision to withdraw its merchant fleet from the Mediterranean was an unexpected move for Rome, because Italy had no intention of entering the war unless the Allies attacked Italy.

After the German invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg began, Phillips telegraphed me again on May 10th, saying that he had seen Ciano again, who had just seen Mussolini. Ciano said that Italy had not decided or considered changing its course because of the new German actions.

But just four days later, the situation had completely changed. Phillips telegraphed me a statement Ciano made to him, saying that a week ago, he still thought the possibility of Italy not entering the war was fifty-fifty, but now the odds in favor of entering the war were ninety-ten. Ciano said that Mussolini had already decided to advocate for it.

After London and Paris received this news, panic reached a climax. Ambassador Bullitt sent me a frantic request, arguing that the President should put more pressure on Mussolini. Prime Minister Reynaud asked us to sell several outdated destroyers to Britain and France, because he expected Italian submarines to start attacking in the Mediterranean.

When Phillips's telegram arrived at the State Department, I sent it to the President. He immediately decided to make another appeal to Mussolini. So we drafted it again with him at the State Department, and I telegraphed it to Ambassador Phillips that night (May 14th).

The President said, "I have told Your Excellency before that I am a realist. I know that you, as a realist, will certainly admit that if this war expands to the whole world, it will exceed the control of the heads of state of all countries, causing the destruction of millions of lives and the crystallization of human freedom and civilization. And no one, no matter how omniscient and omnipotent, can predict the consequences for himself and his own people."

Phillips wanted to see Mussolini again, but this time Mussolini said that he hoped to receive the President's second message through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Three days later, on May 18th, Phillips telegraphed me Mussolini's reply to the President, in which he said that "Italy intends to maintain an alliance with Germany. At a time when the fate of Europe is being gambled, Italy cannot stand idly by."

At the same time, in the days before the reply arrived, Bullitt in Paris tried to maintain the closest contact with the French government, reflecting a natural panic about the ominous turn of the war. He sent many telegrams suggesting what actions our country should take against Italy. He suggested that the President should ask the church to threaten Mussolini, explaining that if Italy entered the war, the Vatican would break off contact with Italy, and ask the Pope to condemn Hitler's aggression from a spiritual standpoint, approaching the issuance of an order to break off contact. He also suggested that our Atlantic Fleet should be sent to Greece for a ceremonial visit, that remittances from Italian immigrants should be cut off if Italy entered the war, and that Italian immigrants and Italian Americans should pass a resolution opposing Italy's participation in the war.

I discussed these suggestions with the President. We were willing to take any steps that might have a reasonable chance of success. But it was already clear that Mussolini had made up his mind.

Then, on May 25th, Churchill and Reynaud invited the President to make another representation to Mussolini. They suggested that the President should make a statement to him based on the following points:

(1) The President has reason to believe that Britain and France are aware that Italy has some dissatisfaction with them on territorial issues.

(2) At present, Britain and France are fully prepared to consider Italy's demands in order to reach an agreement to satisfy Italy's reasonable demands after the war.

(3) The Allies will allow Italy to participate in the peace conference, with a status equal to any belligerent country.

Churchill and Reynaud suggested that the President should add that if Italy avoided entering the war to make things difficult for Britain and France, the United States would do its best to ensure that any agreement reached was fulfilled.

These suggestions must be made by the President on his own behalf, not as an agent of the Allies.

The President soon agreed to this approach without much difficulty. But he did say that rather than acting according to the wishes of Britain and France, he would prefer to continue his method of corresponding with Mussolini on this issue, which is to say that everything was done on his own initiative, not at the request of Britain and France.

The President's message was drafted in the State Department, and I telegraphed it to Ambassador Phillips on May 26th.

Now, there was a definite proposal before Mussolini. According to this proposal, he could get any reasonable demands without resorting to war, and with the United States guaranteeing that Britain and France would abide by the agreement.

But the next day, Phillips telegraphed me Mussolini's "no." Ciano told him that Mussolini's intention was not only to realize Italy's legitimate aspirations, but also to fulfill his alliance responsibilities to Germany.

Although Mussolini's replies were more hostile each time, the President did not give up because of this and wanted to make another attempt to the Italian dictator. We immediately drafted it and telegraphed it to Phillips on May 30th. This time, the President said that "the result of the war expanding again due to Italy's participation in the war will immediately cause the United States itself to step up its rearmament plan and make the United States government redouble its efforts to provide the Allies with every convenience in obtaining all necessary supplies and materials within the United States." The President reminded Mussolini that we have historical interests in the Mediterranean that have been maintained for nearly 150 years.

Mussolini's reply was even more definite and hostile than before. On May 31st, Phillips telegraphed President and me Ciano's statement, in which he said that Mussolini had decided to enter the war, and now it was only a matter of time—a matter of days. When Phillips explained that if Italy entered the war, the attitude of the American public towards Italy would change significantly, Ciano replied that this had already been considered. The next day, Phillips telegraphed me Mussolini's own statement, in which he said that he was willing to fulfill his responsibilities to Germany and was unwilling to "be subjected to any further pressure," because such pressure was "sufficient to make his attitude even tougher." He said that he did not believe that Italy's intervention would necessarily expand the war in the Mediterranean, and questioned our demands for interests in the Mediterranean region, claiming that these demands were equivalent to Italy's demands in the Caribbean Sea.

At this point, France directly expressed to Mussolini its willingness to resolve Italy's territorial demands. But on June 3rd, Bullitt telegraphed me that Ciano replied to the French ambassador to Italy, claiming that Mussolini was not interested in accepting any French territory through peaceful negotiations. He had decided to wage war on France and did not intend to reply to France's message.

The President and Welles still wanted to use France's intentions as a springboard to make another appeal to Mussolini. A draft message had been prepared in the State Department. But by that time, I felt that there had been too many appeals to a thug who was determined to satisfy his own vanity with war. I very firmly opposed issuing this message. My opposition had an effect, and the message prepared on June 7th was not issued.

When Mussolini declared war on Britain and France on June 10th, none of us were surprised. That night, the President delivered a speech at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. He stated the many efforts he had made to prevent Italy from entering the war. Then he said:

"On this day, June 10, 1940, the hand that held the dagger has stabbed it into the back of its neighbor."

This phrase was in the draft that we drafted in the State Department. Welles suggested to the President that he remove it, because saying so would make Mussolini feel so resentful towards him that it would be impossible to obtain his cooperation when the time for peace talks came. In fact, the idea of stabbing in the back had already been used by Prime Minister Reynaud as early as May 20th, and it was mentioned several times in Bullitt's telegrams. The President removed the phrase from his speech, but changed his mind on the way to Charlottesville and reinserted it.

### Britain to Implement Price Controls

[Reuters, London, 13th] Britain's price control plan will be enacted by the end of this month. The list of items subject to price controls will not be announced until then to prevent speculation. The price control measures will be based on the prices in December and January and will have retroactive effect to prevent the effect of stimulating prices before the freeze. It is generally expected that non-essential clothing, porcelain, household linen, glassware, stationery, electric lights, radios, etc. will be on the list of items with price limits.

### Britain, United States, and France to Publish All German Secret Documents: Soviet Propaganda Not Worth Refuting

[Reuters, London, 12th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain, the United States, and France will jointly disclose German secret documents soon, and documents on British-German relations before World War II will also be included. The publishers are the full content of the documents, unlike those recently published by Moscow, which are limited to the conversations between the then British Foreign Secretary Halifax and the British Ambassador Henderson. The documents jointly published by Britain, the United States, and France total three volumes.

[United Press, London, 12th] A Foreign Office spokesman today denied Soviet accusations that Britain had anti-Soviet intentions with Hitler in 1938, saying that this was completely unfounded and not worth refuting. The Soviet Information Bureau announced last night that it had discovered in captured German archives that pre-war British and French policy was aimed at encouraging Hitler to invade the Soviet Union. Britain and France tacitly allowed Germany to occupy Czechoslovakia and Austria, and Britain and France had a non-aggression understanding with Hitler.

### American Commodity Prices Plummet; Both Parties Shirk Responsibility

Villagers Still Hope for Price Controls

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] American commodity prices have fallen sharply in the past eight days. After studying recent market trends, American businessmen have discovered that stock values have fallen by 3 billion US dollars. The severe drop in general commodities is unprecedented in American history. At a time when politicians, financial leaders, and newspapers are assuring the public that this phenomenon is not alarming, the government and the Republican Party are shifting responsibility for the decline in commodity prices, which is truly intriguing. There are now widespread fears of a potentially serious economic downturn.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman stated at a press conference today that although commodity prices have fallen, inflation remains a major crisis. Congress must proceed with enacting the bill he proposed on November 17th of last year to effectively control wages and prices.

[Associated Press, Chicago, 12th] Senator Taft stated that he believes the current price declines will eventually rise and will not cause a collapse or unemployment because there is strong demand for goods and strong purchasing power. Taft also believes that the price declines will not hinder overall employment, unless the declines become more widespread. He believes that some price declines are a good thing because this will help tighten the rising curve of private inflation, which also should not affect the Republican Party's tax reduction plan.

### Ceylon Celebrates Independence; Flag Raising Ceremony Held

[United Press, Ceylon Capital, 12th] Ceylon today held a flag-raising ceremony at the famous Octagonal Temple of the Tooth, where Prime Minister Senanayake hoisted the Lion Flag, symbolizing Ceylon's restoration of independence after 133 years of British rule. Approximately 150,000 people attended the ceremony, including the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. After the ceremony, a grand parade began, led by 100 richly decorated elephants, followed by dancers, drummers, whip wielders, and torchbearers in the thousands. Fireworks were then set off on a small island in the lake next to the temple.

### Lincoln's Birthday Commemoration

Republican Party Political Propaganda Campaign

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] Today is the 139th anniversary of Lincoln's birth.

Today, his birthday is being used by Republicans as a gathering date to strive for a presidential election victory that they have been seeking for fifteen years.

### After the International Tribunal Concludes the Trial of Tojo; US Prosecution Team to Disband; Solid Evidence of Japan's Aggression Against China

[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] It was learned tonight that the US military has abandoned plans to continue trying more than twenty Japanese war criminals. After the trial of the first group of war criminals, including Tojo, is concluded, the international tribunal's prosecution team and defense attorneys will be disbanded. This decision by Washington was based on the recommendation of Chief Prosecutor Keenan. The second group of war criminals currently in detention will be investigated by the Judge Advocate Section of MacArthur's headquarters. If war crimes are confirmed, they will be tried by the Yokohama War Crimes Tribunal.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] During today's session of the Far East International Military Tribunal, US Assistant Prosecutor Sutton read a portion of the general indictment, accusing the twenty-five Class A war crime suspects of deliberately fabricating the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. The portion read by Sutton was the indictment of Japan's aggression against China from 1937 to 1945. It accused the Japanese side of purchasing 6,000 mu of land between Fengtai and the Marco Polo Bridge, but failing to complete the purchase. The Japanese then sought a pretext to seize the Marco Polo Bridge with their troops, and then to control Beiping. Regarding the Japanese launching of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which developed into an eight-year war of aggression against China, the witnesses stated the following: (1) The Japanese military strength in the Marco Polo Bridge area far exceeded the needs for guarding, with Chinese sources estimating 15,000 men. The Japanese side claimed only 7,000 men. (2) The Japanese military exercise on the night of July 7th had "deliberate provocative intentions". (3) The weapons used by the Japanese army during the exercise that night were loaded with live ammunition, not blanks. (4) The Japanese army did not notify the Chinese authorities before conducting the exercise. (5) The exercise was not conducted at a fixed location, but in the area near the railway bridge. (6) Only one defense witness (who was not at the scene when the incident occurred) supported the Japanese version, namely that the Chinese troops fired first from Wanping. (7) No Japanese soldiers went missing after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, as the defendants did not mention this point, and the Japanese military used the missing soldier incident as a pretext for making demands. Although a joint committee was established to investigate the cause of the incident, the Japanese military surrounded Wanping from three sides. Five witnesses testified that the Japanese fired first. The general indictment stated: "The evidence of the Japanese launching the war is clear." The indictment also stated that the Marco Polo Bridge Incident "is extremely similar to the Mukden Incident, but avoids the previous loopholes." After the two sides agreed on July 9th to cease military action through negotiations, the Japanese military reinforced its forces to 20,000 men and 100 aircraft. The war then restarted on July 14th. At the same time, the Japanese General Staff decided to greatly increase the troop strength in the area. The Japanese government insisted on the pretext of "local resolution" in an attempt to make North China autonomous in all aspects. The general indictment listed a large amount of testimony to confirm the Japanese intentions.

### US to Conduct Air Combat Exercises on the Far Eastern Border; Ten Flying Fortresses Arrive in Tokyo

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th] Ten US Air Force B-29 aircraft arrived here from the United States on the 13th and will conduct "30-Day Intensive Air Combat Exercises" along the US air frontier in the Far East. The Soviet Union has repeatedly complained that American aircraft often cross the border into Soviet-controlled areas. The US Army announced that the exercises will be conducted under "simulated combat" conditions. It also stated that this is part of the US peacetime policy, "The US peacetime policy is to station major strategic forces in internal areas, which can be deployed to any part of the world in case of emergency."

### Security Council Postpones Debate on Indo-Pakistani Dispute; Indian Representative Returns Home to Receive New Instructions

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 13th] The United Nations Security Council reached a compromise with India on the 13th to continue debating the Indo-Pakistani dispute while allowing the Indian representative to return home to receive new instructions. The Security Council has decided to suspend the debate for six days without opposition. The next Security Council meeting will discuss new dispute issues, not just the Kashmir issue. This compromise was proposed by Security Council Chairman Carter and Representative McNaughton.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 13th] The chairman of the Indian delegation to the Security Council, Ayyangar, along with five members of the delegation, left here by plane today, taking the route through Paris and Cairo back to Mumbai.

Two shops had insufficient documents, and four non-member shops still require investigation. The Social Affairs Bureau will begin writing the business licenses for the approved gold shops today and will issue them to the shops in ten days, after which they can officially resume business.

Regarding the wage issue after the resumption of jewelry sales by gold shops, the employer's demand for 100% was considered unreasonable by Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau. It is reported that the wage is intended to be flexible and may be calculated proportionally according to the cost of living index in the future.

### Coal Supply Improves; 70,000 Tons at Qinhuangdao; Expected to Arrive in Shanghai by the End of the Month

According to the Fuel Management Committee, the coal supply this month will improve compared to last month.

### Propaganda Squad Works in the Rain

The Shanghai Anti-Rebellion Propaganda Squad continued to set out yesterday to conduct propaganda work despite the rain. It dispatched two teams: a folk art team and a costumed speech team. The folk art team utilized Spring Festival folk customs, dressing up as "Jumping Officials" to promote the message that the communist bandits are causing chaos, and when people are poor, even the gods are poor. Only by uniting to suppress the bandits and eliminate the communists can everyone have a peaceful life. They also performed "Fisherman Capturing Demons," in which the team members dressed up as a fisherman and a clam spirit. The fisherman represents the National Army, and the clam spirit represents the communist bandits. With the accompaniment of gongs and drums, they performed various postures of capturing bandits, which were very popular among the people in various places.

### Preparing to Sell 100,000 Dan of Rice to Prevent Today's Red-Letter Price Surge; Food Distribution Committee Summoned Rice Merchants for Talks Yesterday, Using Year-End Closing Price as Standard

[Reported by This Newspaper] The rice market, after a seven-day Spring Festival holiday, will open with a red-letter day today, resuming trading. Ren Xianqun, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Municipal Food Distribution Committee, and Ji Mingqi, Section Chief of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, summoned representatives of rice merchants to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to discuss issues such as market prices and government sales of rice. According to Ren Xianqun, the rumor that the retail price of white rice during the Spring Festival had exceeded 2 million yuan is untrue. The government, fearing price fluctuations in the red-letter market, has stored a large amount of rice, ready to sell it on the market at any time. The rice merchants, fearing that the sale of rice would affect their sales and the commissions of intermediaries, requested that the government not sell rice on the market before rice prices fluctuate. The Food Distribution Committee has now prepared 100,000 dan of rice, with 50,000 dan allocated to each of the North and South markets. If the market fluctuates, it will be sold at any time and a flexible strategy will be adopted. The selling price and market trading price will be based on the market's final closing price at the end of last year. At that time, the production area Wuxi Superior White Japonica was 1.6 million, Songjiang Japonica was 1.42 million, and Suzhou White Rice was 1.4 million. The Shanghai trading price in the North Market was 1.868 million for Superior Japonica. Therefore, today's red-letter price will be maintained between 1.68 million and 1.8 million. If there are fluctuations, the authorities will sell the prepared rice on the market.

### Forty of Our Military Police to Depart for Japan by Ship on the 20th

The news of the military police unit going to Japan has been circulating for a long time, because the foreign exchange funds had to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, so it has been delayed until now. It is reported that MacArthur's headquarters stated: Although this is the first time in history that our country has sent troops to Japan, it is not an occupation, but only to perform the task of guarding the mission, so it is hoped that our country will not publicize it too much to avoid misunderstandings.

### Banditry in the Wusong Anchorage Steals Firewood Boats

[Reported by This Newspaper] In the anchorage outside of Wusong, bands of bandits have been active recently, and ships entering and leaving the port are often robbed. The afternoon before yesterday, two bandit boats were discovered near the Bailonggang Chicken Buoy. They even pretended to be water police patrol boats and intercepted the Jin Shunli firewood boat that was coming from Dinghai to Songjiang. At the time, there were eight or nine bandits armed with weapons who searched the boat. Because the boat's cargo had not been sold and there was no large sum of money, they only stole one hundred and several tens of thousands of yuan in cash, one shi of white rice, and the crew's clothes, quilts, and other items. The boat sailed into the Songjiang anchorage yesterday.

### Six Prisoners Escape from District Court Detention Center; Captured; Sent to District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation

[Reported by This Newspaper] Six thieves, Lu Wenbin, Wu Fusheng, Huang Muxiang, Ye Shaochun, Chen Changlin, and Tang Shigen, who were detained in the Third Detention Center of the District Court on North Zhejiang Road, had sentences of about ten years each. Lu and others conspired to escape. Huang Muxiang, who had previously worked as a mason, was in charge of breaking through the roof of the fourth floor of the detention center. At 6:00 AM on the 10th of this month (that is, the first day of the lunar new year), the six prisoners climbed out of the hole in the roof and jumped down. Huang Muxiang accidentally lost his footing and fell to the ground, sustaining serious injuries. The other five prisoners jumped to other roofs. At this time, they were spotted by bailiffs, who surrounded and searched for them. Lu Wenbin, Wu Fusheng, and Huang Muxiang were captured first. Ye Shaochun, Chen Changlin, and Tang Shigen, seeing the situation was not good, crawled back into the original hole and were also arrested. Yesterday, the detention center sent the six prisoners to the District Prosecutor's Office, requesting that they be investigated for the crime of escape. After interrogating them, Prosecutor He Huimin determined that the circumstances of the crime were obvious and ordered that they all be detained. Huang Muxiang was injured in the fall, and the detention center was ordered to treat him properly.

### Total Amount of Surplus Materials Remaining in India Received in Shanghai

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan began receiving materials remaining in India in Shanghai in the summer of 1946. By the end of December 1947, it had received materials worth more than 22.435 million US dollars, and approximately 1,728 tons of items without a value basis. Among them, the aviation equipment was allocated to the Ministry of National Defense, the ordnance equipment was allocated to the Ordnance Department, and the trucks required approval from President Chiang before they could be allocated. Other types of materials were evaluated and sold by the Materials Supply Bureau. The materials that had been allocated and sold were worth more than 13.171 million US dollars, most of which were Dodge trucks, khaki twill cotton cloth, and tires. The materials remaining in India, also known as Lend-Lease materials, originally belonged to the US Lend-Lease Act and were transported to India by the US during the Chinese War of Resistance. After the end of the war in China, the US military declared them surplus materials. In February 1946, because the US government stipulated that all materials must be purchased at a price before they could be transferred, former President Song decided to purchase them, totaling more than 24 million US dollars (weighing approximately 40,000 tons), which was used to offset the debt in US currency in our country. The above materials were received from the US military stationed in India by the Former Remaining Indian Materials Receiving Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs starting in April 1946. In May, the first batch of materials was shipped from India to Shanghai and handed over to the Shanghai Receiving and Transfer Office of the committee for processing. After the committee was dissolved, it was ordered to transfer the materials to the Materials Supply Bureau for receipt. The unwieldy transportation of the materials left in India was transferred to the Executive Yuan Standing Committee in India for transportation, until the completion of transportation in October 1947. The bureau is still actively receiving and sorting.

### Once in the Spring Breeze, Banknotes Changed Color; Leech Applies Tricks; Scoundrel is Brought Under Control

[Reported by This Newspaper] Canadian sailor Cheng Lian, feeling bored during his ship's stay, went ashore for a stroll. On the night of the 11th of this month, introduced by a "leech" next to the road, he went to a brothel at 21 Le'an Lane, Kunming Road, to solicit prostitutes. Weilian had 4 million legal tender in his pocket. While he was engrossed and unable to pay attention, the "leech" stole the 4 million legal tender and replaced them with twenty-one 100-yuan notes from the bogus Central Reserve Bank. The next day, Xianlian left the hospital and went shopping by the roadside. When he saw that the banknotes were changing color, he knew something was wrong. After someone explained it to him, he realized that they were counterfeit. He then turned the person in charge of the brothel, Yang Lianbao, over to the Tilanqiao Police Station. The Tilanqiao Police Station transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday, Prosecutor He Huimin interrogated him. Yang confessed: "The brothel was opened by Xiangdi, the wife of Liu Bosu. All the prostitutes had returned home for the Lunar New Year. The leech brought a foreigner on the night of the 11th, and the prostitute was also brought from outside and stayed overnight. I am the caretaker of the brothel and could not refuse. As for the matter of exchanging legal tender with counterfeit money, I am not aware of it. Afterwards, the leech and the prostitute both left and cannot be found." After Yang finished his confession, Prosecutor He ordered Yang to submit a written guarantee of 5 million yuan.

### Fugitive in Smuggling Supplies to the Bandits Case, "Butterfly" Caught in Linyi

[Reported from Jinan, 13th, by Dihua Daily, Linyi] According to Dihua Daily, Linyi, Liu Qianmei, nicknamed "Butterfly," wife of Ai Xinghua, the male protagonist in the major smuggling supplies to bandits case cracked in Shanghai last year, is from Datian, Juxian County. She was originally wanted by the government after Ai was arrested. Ai was the person in charge of the Binhai District Cooperative of the bandits. After Ai was arrested, Liu Qianmei went into hiding in Shijiusuo, Rizhao, and her life was still provided for by the bandits. When the bandits fled, she lived with Hao Xishan (from Linyi), who was ordered to impersonate a major staff officer of the Ministry of National Defense. She came to Linyi on the sly a week ago to work as a spy. She was captured by Wang Xianchen, director of the Linyi Police Department, on January 16th. According to her confession, her husband Ai went to Shanghai in May 1946 to buy a car and was arrested. She had received considerable training and served as a literacy class leader. This time she came to Linyi with a major mission. Hao fled upon hearing the news, but after Wang made multiple reconnaissance, he was also arrested. The rest of the gang is currently being investigated.

### Doctor Accused of Bigamy by Wife, Leads Police in Midnight Raid on Love Nest

[Report from this Newspaper] Hou Yunqing, 43, a doctor at the Red Cross Hospital on Huashan Road and a native of Nantong, residing at No. 730 Daxilu, has recently been passionately in love with Fang Cailin (21), a woman from Anting, and cohabiting with her at No. 61 Hongye Garden, Yuyuan Road, often not returning home. This led his wife, Zhuang Min (40), to discover this and, after earnest and well-intentioned attempts to dissuade him, found them to be largely ineffective. Filled with resentment, she reported this to the Changning Police Station a few days ago, accusing him of bigamy.

Facts

Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui all served as assistants at Jianghai Customs. Yin Lansun was the head of the Import License Verification Section of the Appraisal Department of the Customs, while the others served as staff members of the section. They were all responsible for verifying whether goods entering the port were consistent with the import license. Between July and September 1947, the Lungenji Construction Plant, opened by Lu Genquan, ordered 400 tons of galvanized iron sheets (commonly known as "white iron sheets") from Yifeng Company, which were shipped from New York, USA, in batches and arrived in Shanghai. They possessed Import Temporary Management Committee (hereinafter referred to as "Shu Guan Hui") Import Permit No. 14043. All permits named as pre-announcement took November 17, 1946, the date of the promulgation of the Temporary Measures for Revising Import and Export Trade, as the standard for before and after. According to regulations, this permit should be verified by Yin Lansun, the director in charge. It stated that exchange settlement was not allowed, meaning that the Bank of China had already supplied foreign exchange. Since it was not a case of merchants handling their own foreign exchange, it should be released. However, Yin Lansun usually made things difficult, suppressed and leveraged his position to extort property, and colluded with Zhang Yuan, a retired customs officer, to negotiate and receive bribes. This was well known to his colleagues and Shanghai merchants. Moreover, being experienced and capable, he was trusted by his subordinate officials. Mao Yixiang, the general manager of Yifeng Company, taking advantage of Lu Genquan's urgent need for goods and the difficulties caused by the customs officers, colluded with customs broker Fang Maolin. Through Shen Yanlu, Zhang Gaozhen, and Mei Futang, they secretly contacted Yue Xinmin and asked Zhang Yuan to discuss with Yin Lansun. Yin Lansun used the excuse that the permit should be sent to Shu Guan Hui for review and extension, stating that it would not be possible to avoid this without paying a large handling fee. Through Zhang Yuan's collusion with Zhang Baohui, and an implied message from Mei Futang to Zhang Gaozhen, Zhang Gaozhen relayed it to Shen Yanlu and then to Fang Maolin, helping layer by layer to achieve their goals. Mei and others also took advantage of this opportunity, increasing the amount with each pass, ultimately reaching a total of 13,360 US dollars. Unless the full amount was paid, the documents would be withheld. Lu Genquan, unable to bear the increasing daily interest and the stagnation of funds, secretly reported to the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. The Bureau secretly ordered him to make the payment in order to ascertain the truth. Indeed, on October 16 and 17, 1947, after paying the full amount, the documents were returned and the goods were allowed to be imported.

Furthermore, between June and October of the same year, Lifengyong Dyestuff Company purchased 100 tons of aniline oil dyes and several other batches of dyes from the United States. Tianhe and Dakang Dyestuff Companies jointly purchased 64 barrels of dyes from the United States. Yifeng Company purchased 150,000 pounds of wool from the United Kingdom. Minfu Company purchased 605 barrels of caustic soda and 17.5 tons of dyes from Hong Kong. These goods were shipped to Shanghai one after another. Lifengyong's aniline oil did not exceed the limit, but other dyes exceeded the quantity or time limit. Tianhe and Dakang borrowed Xin'fu Company's permit. Yifeng's wool exceeded the quantity stated on the permit. Yang Shude was entrusted to find a way to manage these things, and Chen Liangjiong was entrusted to manage Minfu's caustic soda and dyes, which were borrowed from Jinshan Company's dye permit. Therefore, Yang Shutang and Chen Liangjiong separately incited Zhang Yuan to ask Yin Lansun and others to violate their duties, knowingly turning a blind eye and approving the goods in advance. Chen Liangjiong had also agreed with Zhang Yuan in advance to falsely add an item for caustic soda to the permit. Yang Shude and Chen Liangjiong each paid money to Zhang Yuan for distribution. Lifengyong paid bribes of 385 million yuan, Minfu paid 800 million yuan, Tianhe and others paid 90 million yuan, and Yifeng paid 300 million yuan. Zhang Yuan successively brought the money to Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui for distribution. As a result, regardless of whether the import permit should be reviewed by the Shu Guan Hui, corrected, sent for approval, or processed in sequence, the section completed the process ahead of schedule, allowing the goods for which bribes had been paid to be imported smoothly. The Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense discovered this and sent it to the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court, which ordered the prosecutors of this court to investigate and prosecute.

Reasoning

The evidence on which the above facts are based and the applicable laws will be discussed separately below:

(1) Defendant Yin Lansun's portion: (1) Regarding the case of the import of galvanized iron sheets by Yifeng Company:

The defendant was questioned by this court and stated, "I am responsible for verifying import permits pre-announced. The import permit of Yifeng Company was pre-announced, with no time limit and not related to black market foreign exchange. Zhang Yuan brought the permit and asked me for help. Initially, I wanted him to send it to the Shu Guan Hui's Non-Quota Review Office for study. Later, Shen Chanlu declared the goods, and Yue Xinmin personally told me to let it pass because the permit was supplied foreign exchange by the Bank of China. Zhang Yuan sent me 1,500 US dollars, and I accepted it. In short, my monthly salary is only over 5.5 million. My father died in Tianjin, my mother died early, neither was buried, and I have a wife and children, which is not enough to cover expenses, so I was tempted by money. I ask all levels of superiors for forgiveness." Combined with Zhang Gaozhen's statement, "Zhang Yuan said that if 8,000 US dollars were not sent to the customs, the form would not be issued," it is sufficient to confirm his difficulties, suppression, and extortion of property. Moreover, Mao Fengxiang stated that "Fang Maolin first wanted a customs clearance fee of 50 million yuan, then 7%, 8%, and finally 15%, which was calculated as 12,260 US dollars, and then increased by another 1,000 US dollars. This 1,000 US dollars was because the bill of lading was still not returned after the fee was paid, and they wanted to increase it by 2,000 before agreeing to add another 1,000 US dollars," while Lu Genquan said, "Mao Fengxiang wanted 16% during the first negotiation, which was later reduced to 15%, calculated as 13,360 US dollars, or 119,718 million yuan in legal tender." The fact that 16% was wanted during the first negotiation is sufficient to prove that the defendants' internal extortion amount, step-by-step increase, is a deliberate distortion of their words by the defendants to avoid suspicion of collusion. The agreement between them was confirmed. Otherwise, the facilitator would have demanded a 16% customs clearance fee during the first negotiation with the victim, instead of saying that only 7% or 8% was needed. From this, it can be concluded that the defendants' joint extortion of a large sum of money was consistent, and the defendant, who was in charge of verification, was greedy and unrestrained, disregarding the government's intention to punish corruption and promote honesty in government. His crime is extremely heinous, and he cannot presumptuously seek forgiveness.

(2) Regarding the case of Lifengyong and other companies importing foreign goods:

The defendant stated, "Lifengyong's aniline oil and other goods wanted me to pass them early and sent me 20 million yuan. For Yifeng's wool import, I was on sick leave. Zhang Yuan came to my house and said that the wool import had been approved by Zhang Baohui and Yue Xinmin, and they sent you 20 million yuan. The import of Minfu's caustic soda and dyes was also Zhang Yuan asking me to accommodate them and sending me 3,000 US dollars. I don't know about Tianhe and Dakang's affairs." He also stated, "I successively borrowed 60 million yuan from Zhang Yuan, and he said I didn't have to pay it back because I usually helped him a lot." Checking the customs declarations, there should be a sequence, and it is wrong to receive bribes and permit the import in advance. Verification of documents is mandatory and one cannot act arbitrarily. Now, due to receiving bribes, one is said to be "early" and the other is said to be "accommodated," which is sufficient to prove that they jointly committed acts that violated their duties with Yue Xinmin and Zhang Baohui, with Zhang Yuan as an accomplice. Moreover, Lifengyong's several batches of dyes either did not match the names of the goods listed in the original permit, borrowed the permit of another company, or had no permit at all. Minfu's dyes and 60 tons of industrial raw materials were using Jinshan Company's permit, and the 605 barrels of caustic soda had no permit at all. It was because they agreed with Chen Liangjiong, who had discussed with Zhang Yuan, that the item for caustic soda was added to the above permit. Tianhe and Dakang jointly shipped 64 barrels of dyes to Shanghai, but only had bills of lading and sales contracts, without an import permit. Yifeng's 150,000 tons of wool shipped to Shanghai exceeded the amount stated on the permit by several times, and the permit had expired. All were in the category of not being allowed to import, as stated clearly by Yang Shude, Chen Liangjiong, and Zhang Yuan, and confirmed by the documents attached to the case. However, the defendant still argued, "The unscrupulous merchants are too bad and deceive us in various ways, making it difficult to verify," and so on. If that were the case, why were things made difficult and suppressed before Zhang Yuan accepted the bribe, and why were all approved early after Zhang Yuan handed over the bribe? Why was the bribe still delivered to his home while he was on sick leave? Why borrow as much as 60 million yuan from Zhang Yuan, a colleague who had resigned and was idle in Shanghai, and be exempt from repaying it due to his usual help? It can be seen that he colluded with Zhang Yuan to hand over and negotiate matters outside. Therefore, regardless of the number of times, the defendants' prior and subsequent joint intent to violate their duties was consistent and unambiguous, and should be considered continuous crimes.

(2) Defendant Yue Min's portion

Checking the defendant's statements regarding the various instances of allowing the galvanized iron sheets of Yihang Company, the aniline oil of Lifengyong Company, the dyes of Tianhe and Dakang Companies, the wool of Yifeng Company, and the bait and caustic soda of Minfu Company to be cleared in advance, there are some inconsistencies in his confessions. However, after being questioned by this court, he stated, "I successively received 3,000 US dollars each from Yifeng and Minfu, and also received 20 to 30 million yuan in legal tender, the exact amount of which I don't remember. Yin Lansun is very secretive and trusted by his superiors. Zhang Yuan relays everything to me, and I cannot speak directly to him." This is generally consistent with the previous statements of the co-conspirators and the defendant during the investigations by the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense and the Prosecutor's Office of this court, as well as his confession (see pages 68 to 70 of the first volume of the Bureau's file). Moreover, referring to the various documents attached to the case, it is undoubtedly that he committed the crime jointly with Yin Lansun and others. Now, let's discuss whether this part and the other cases he committed stemmed from a comprehensive criminal intent. He stated, "Zhang Gaozhen asked me to do it, and Yin Lansun, Zhang Gaozhen, and others are bad people. Don't associate with them. I returned the things (referring to the invoices, bills of lading, permits, etc.) to Zhang Gaozhen. Later, Zhang Gaozhen said that Mei Futang had agreed to send 8,000 US dollars, and Director Yin agreed to it. I received 3,000 US dollars. They (referring to Zhang Yuan, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui) each received 1,500 US dollars, and the rest was used for miscellaneous expenses." According to Zhang Gaozhen's statement, "If 8,000 US dollars were not given, the form would not be issued," it is undoubtedly that they jointly extorted property. Since this part is different from the continuous crime of receiving bribes for violating duties, and the intention stemmed from the defendant himself, it cannot be considered to have stemmed from a comprehensive criminal intent and should be treated separately.

Mr. Wu is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing today (the 14th). Regarding the Provisional Measures for Rice Rationing by Population in this city, they were submitted to the Municipal Council for approval on January 30th and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for appropriate revisions. The detailed implementation rules for rice rationing have been drafted by the People's Food Allocation Committee and approved by yesterday's Municipal Council meeting. Director Wu will present these measures and implementation rules for discussion at the Five City Mayors' Meeting in Beijing. The full text is recorded below:

Provisional Measures for Rice Rationing by Population in Shanghai

1. In order to regulate the food supply for the people, the City of Shanghai will conduct a trial implementation of rice rationing by population from March to June of the 37th year (1948), and these measures are specifically established for this purpose.

2. During the trial period of rice rationing by population, all citizens of Shanghai must purchase rice with the rice purchase certificates issued by the government, and all rice shops must sell rice upon presentation of the certificates.

3. Citizens aged seven and above are considered "large mouths" and may purchase no more than two shi dou of rice per month. Those under the age of seven are considered "small mouths" and may purchase no more than one shi dou of rice per month.

4. Regardless of whether a citizen is considered "large mouth" or "small mouth," the government will allocate and sell one shi dou of rice per month at a fixed price, supplied equally from U.S. relief rice and government-reserved rice.

5. In addition to the rice allocated and sold by the government, "large mouth" citizens may purchase no more than one shi dou of rice from rice shops at market prices.

6. Hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and other establishments with transient populations may purchase rice at market prices from rice shops with the government-issued quota rice purchase certificates.

7. The rice rationing by population will be handled by the Shanghai People's Food Allocation Committee, and all agencies under the Municipal Government should provide full assistance.

8. These measures shall be implemented after being approved by the Municipal Council and ratified by the Executive Yuan. The detailed implementation rules shall be drafted by the People's Food Allocation Committee and implemented after being approved by the Shanghai Municipal Government.

Detailed Implementation Rules for the Provisional Measures for Rice Rationing by Population in Shanghai

1. These detailed rules are formulated in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Measures for Rice Rationing by Population in Shanghai.

2. U.S. relief rice and government-reserved rice are collectively referred to as "rationed rice." Rice that is permitted to be purchased from rice shops at market prices is referred to as "permitted purchase rice."

3. Rice purchase certificates are divided into three types: household registration rice purchase certificates, temporary rice purchase certificates, and special rice purchase certificates, which are printed and issued by the Shanghai People's Food Allocation Committee.

(A) Household registration rice purchase certificates are applicable to citizens with household registration in the city. "Large mouth" rice purchase certificates are divided into two sections. The first section specifies one shi dou of rationed rice (actual weight of fifteen shi jin) and the rationing period (divided into the first half of the month, from the 1st to the 12th, and the second half of the month, from the 16th to the 27th). The second section is divided into five grids, each specifying two shi sheng of permitted purchase rice and the effective month. Each section and grid can be used separately. "Small mouth" rice purchase certificates only have one section for rationed rice.

(B) Temporary rice purchase certificates are applicable to people who have just arrived in Shanghai and are in the process of registering their household registration, or to people who are staying temporarily in the homes of relatives and friends.

(C) Special rice purchase certificates are applicable to transient populations in hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and passing ships. Each certificate specifies one shi dan or five shi dan of permitted purchase rice and the effective month.

4. Based on the household registration survey statistics of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs, before the 25th of last month, the People's Food Allocation Committee will issue the household registration rice purchase certificates to the district offices for receipt. After receiving the rice purchase certificates, the district offices should, within two days, jointly with representatives of the district people's representative assembly, issue them to the neighborhood offices for receipt. After receiving the household registration rice purchase certificates, the neighborhood offices should, within three days, issue them to each household for receipt.

5. People who have just arrived in Shanghai and are in the process of registering their household registration, or people who are staying temporarily in the homes of relatives and friends, can apply to the district office for a temporary rice purchase certificate after obtaining proof from the neighborhood chief. The quantity is calculated based on the number of days (six ge per person per day, regardless of whether they are "large mouth" or "small mouth") and is limited to permitted purchase rice. The district office should register the issuance of temporary rice purchase certificates every ten days and report to the People's Food Allocation Committee for record.

6. The rice needed for the transient population in hotels, restaurants, hospitals, etc., shall be determined by the relevant competent authorities and transferred to the People's Food Allocation Committee for the issuance of special rice purchase certificates. The rice needed for the transient population on passing ships, etc., shall be pre-issued by the People's Food Allocation Committee to the district offices for a certain number of shi dan of special rice purchase certificates. When applications are received, the district offices shall verify and issue them, and report to the People's Food Allocation Committee for record every ten days.

7. The price of rationed rice will be set once a month and announced on the first day of each month.

8. The distribution of rationed rice: (1) All rice shops in each district of the city that are legally registered with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and that have obtained guarantees from two trade associations or legally registered businesses; (2) Cooperatives and social service centers in each district may apply to the People's Food Allocation Committee to undertake this task. These rice shops, cooperatives, and social service centers undertaking this task are all referred to as "grain rationing shops" (application form and guarantee form attached) and are given a number. The Social Affairs Bureau should first compile a list of legally registered rice shops before the end of January of the 36th year (1947) and assign them numbers, along with cooperatives and social service centers in each district that undertake grain rationing, and send the list to the Food Allocation Committee for rice allocation. The rice for the first half of the next month must be allocated by the end of the previous month, and the rice for the second half of the month must be allocated during the first half of the month.

9. Grain rationing shops are given a handling fee of 5% of the sales price for distributing rationed rice (deducted daily). If their performance is excellent, they may be given a bonus of 2%. This will be paid at the end of each month or every two months (depending on the session schedule of the district people's representative assembly).

10. Citizens may choose the grain rationing shop or rice shop they trust to purchase rationed rice and permitted purchase rice, but only within the jurisdiction of their district.

11. The total amount of rationed rice and permitted purchase rice purchased by each household from the grain rationing shop or rice shop each time shall not exceed three shi dan. If the total amount of rice needed by each household exceeds three shi dan, it should be purchased in installments within the time limit specified in Article 3.

12. The rice needed for collective living in factories, schools, etc., may be applied for by factories, schools, etc., by collecting the household registration rice purchase certificates of their employees and paying the fees to the People's Food Allocation Committee, and directly withdrawing the rice from the warehouse.

13. Grain rationing shops should publicly display samples of the rationed rice they are selling with labels attached.

14. Grain rationing shops should prepare an adhesive book to paste the first section of the household registration rice purchase certificates (rationed rice). Each page is limited to 100 certificates. Except for the last page, which may have an odd number of certificates, all other pages must not have any omissions. The date should be clearly marked on each certificate pasted in the book every day, and the total number of certificates sold on that day should be calculated for verification. At the end of each month, the adhesive book, along with the monthly report, should be sent to the People's Food Allocation Committee for review. Any remaining rice may be carried over to the next month's sales volume.

15. Grain rationing shops should remit the rice money sold on the previous day to the designated bank or postal remittance branch for collection every day and obtain a payment receipt for verification.

16. Grain rationing shops should list the quantity sold and the amount of money paid on the same day every day and send it to the district office for record. At mid-month and end-month, accounts should be cleared (daily report and half-monthly report forms attached, to be prepared by the grain rationing shops according to the format).

17. All kinds of rice purchase certificates must not be transferred or assigned. If the above circumstances are violated, the buyer and seller shall be fined five times the amount for the first offense, and the penalty shall be doubled for each subsequent offense.

18. Personnel at all levels must not issue or withhold rice purchase certificates indiscriminately. Violators will be severely punished according to law.

19. Grain rationing shops that have excellent performance in distributing rationed rice may be given a bonus of 2% of the sales price of the distribution volume upon the suggestion of the district people's representative assembly and the approval of the Shanghai People's Food Allocation Committee.

20. If a grain rationing shop has any of the following circumstances, it may be given one of the following penalties, depending on the severity of the circumstances: (1) cancellation of the distribution, (2) temporary suspension of business, or (3) permanent closure of business. The People's Food Allocation Committee may request the Social Affairs Bureau to handle this.

(A) Cannot obtain the trust of the citizens and sells less than 60 shi dan of rationed rice per month.

(B) Deducts the quantity, which is verified after being reported by the citizens.

(C) Exchanges and sells inferior quality rice.

(D) Adulterates the rice.

(E) Misappropriates the sales money for rationed rice and does not handle it according to regulations.

(F) Fails to submit reports on time.

21. Rice shops selling permitted purchase rice should, according to the method in Article 14, prepare an adhesive book to paste and save the permitted purchase certificates. At the end of each month, the total number should be calculated as the monthly business volume of the rice shop and reported to the district office and the Food Allocation Committee for record. The Food Allocation Committee will compile a general register based on this and send it to the Social Affairs Bureau for record.

22. Rice shops purchasing rice from the rice market shall temporarily use the business volume stipulated in Article 21 as the standard and shall not exceed 20% of the total business volume of the previous month, and must go through registration procedures with the personnel stationed in the market by the Social Affairs Bureau.

23. Remaining rice in the market may be applied to the Food Allocation Committee for mortgage or purchase.

24. In order to handle rice rationing, the Food Allocation Committee should send personnel to reside in each district to be responsible for assisting the work of the district chief and may send personnel to guide and audit at any time.

25. These detailed rules will be promulgated and implemented after being resolved by the Shanghai Municipal Council.

Weighing the Pros and Cons, I Had to Resort to This Policy

A few hours after Mussolini declared war, Premier Reynaud and his government, before leaving Paris, telegraphed a dramatic appeal to President Roosevelt, asking him to publicly announce that the United States would support the Allied Powers in every way except sending an expeditionary force.

He said, "We will fight before Paris, we will fight after Paris. We will fight in one province, and if we are driven out of that province, we will establish ourselves in North Africa and continue fighting, and if necessary, we will fight in our territories in the Americas."

The Premier and I knew that the French could neither fight before Paris, nor fight after Paris, nor fight in one province. (What Reynaud had in mind was the province of Brittany.) But France could still maintain control of its fleet, retreat to North Africa, and continue fighting there.

Although we had the best of intentions and good will in the world, we also knew that we had material and political limits in aiding France. The Battle of France was, in fact, already over, and there was simply no way we could stop Hitler from conquering France. So we tried to issue a reply to encourage Reynaud and his government to continue fighting in North Africa and to maintain the integrity of the French fleet.

German troops occupied Paris on July 14, the day before the President issued his reply. Ambassador Bullitt assisted the military mayor in handing over this undefended city to the Germans without bloodshed. Bullitt stayed behind on his own accord, not going with the French government to Tours, and then to Bordeaux. He believed that staying in Paris under German occupation (at least temporarily) could contribute more to the Allied Powers and the people of Paris than fleeing with the French government. He had in mind the actions of American Ambassador Herrick, who stayed in Paris during World War I and did not go to Bordeaux with the French government.

In my opinion, this decision was unfortunate. During the critical week from June 10, when the French government left Paris, to June 17, when it requested an armistice, Bullitt was unable to maintain any contact with the French government. If Bullitt could have represented us during those historic days, then his unparalleled close relationship with the leaders of the French government might have led the government to take the fleet to North Africa and continue fighting from there.

Bullitt's position was taken over by Ambassador Biddle, who had previously been our representative to the Polish government in exile in Paris. Biddle was an excellent diplomat. But in terms of his relationship with and influence over the French government, he could not compare with Bullitt.

When the German troops reached Paris, Bullitt communicated directly with the President because he knew that the State Department would oppose the recommendations he was about to make. So he contacted the President personally. He suggested staying in Paris and not going with the French government.

Bullitt communicated with the President directly by phone and telegraph on many occasions. He also set up a private code specifically for communicating with the President. This method of operation reached its peak during the painful days of France's defeat. As a result, the State Department was sometimes completely unaware of what Bullitt was thinking and doing, although the President informed me of many of the messages from Bullitt and always provided me with full information when I inquired about a particular issue. Mr. Roosevelt enjoyed the dramatic side of diplomatic work and therefore did not object to this method.

When I learned of Bullitt's suggestion, I went to see the President. I told him that I opposed this method and believed that our ambassador should go with the French government. In my opinion, Bullitt's influence over the German occupying authorities in Paris would be minimal because his strong anti-Nazi sentiments were well known to the German government. But on the other hand, his influence over the French government could be decisive.

So the President personally called Bullitt. He told the ambassador that he (the President) and I believed that he should leave Paris with the French government. The argument he put forward was that Bullitt might be assassinated by communists or Nazis because he was long hated by both. Bullitt said that he could not escape danger and argued strongly, finally causing the President to abandon his opposition.

In Tours, and later in Bordeaux, Ambassador Biddle continued this struggle, visiting Reynaud, Pétain, Naval Minister Admiral Darlan, Daladier, and others repeatedly, reiterating our view that France should continue to resist while its navy remained intact. Biddle's dispatches provided vivid accounts of the disputes within the French cabinet, with Reynaud opposing the armistice, Pétain supporting it, and, outside the cabinet, the vile Laval beginning to exert his influence in preparation for surrender

So, on the night of June 16, Reynaud resigned, Pétain formed a new cabinet, with Baudouin as Foreign Minister and Admiral Darlan as Naval Minister, and sought an armistice.

The British and American governments struggled to ensure the safety of the French navy. Churchill sent his Naval Minister, his First Sea Lord, and his Colonial Minister to Bordeaux to represent him. After discussing the situation with the President, I sent Ambassador Biddle one of the strongest telegrams in my career, telling him to convey it to the Pétain government.

I said, "The President hopes you will say that, in the opinion of our government, if the French government fails to ensure that its fleet does not fall into enemy hands before signing any armistice agreement with the Germans, then the French government will cause serious damage to the preservation of the French Empire and the ultimate restoration of French independence and autonomy. Furthermore, if the French government fails to take such steps and allows the French fleet to surrender to Germany, then the French government will forever lose the friendship and goodwill of the American government."

This message was almost reckless, but given the situation, only a strong message might have some effect.

On June 18, as Darlan was about to attend a cabinet meeting, Biddle handed him this telegram. Biddle visited Baudouin while the cabinet meeting was in progress and gave him a copy. Although Baudouin seemed extremely angry about the strong language in the note in Biddle’s opinion, he and Darlan still placed it before the cabinet. The government then decided that under no circumstances would the fleet be handed over to the Germans, and if the surrender of the navy was included in the German conditions, the armistice should be rejected.

The French fleet was not the only thing we were concerned about. We were also concerned about what might happen to the British fleet. Now that France had succumbed, Hitler could transfer all his forces to deal with Britain. The President and I believed that Britain could and would be able to successfully resist the Nazi invasion, but in the Americas and Europe, many people held the same view as Pétain and his ilk, believing that Britain would be conquered or reconciled within weeks.

When British Ambassador Lothian came to see me on June 11, he said that he had received a suggestion from Churchill advocating that naval officers from our two governments hold staff talks to discuss fleet movements in the Atlantic and Pacific. I replied that I doubted there would be an opportunity to hold staff talks, but I was happy to convey this suggestion to the President.

Lothian asked me if his military attaché could discuss with the appropriate officials in the War Department the effects of Anglo-French bombing inside Germany. I said that I was sure that our military personnel would be happy to provide his military attaché with any information within their capabilities, although we could not engage in the exchange of such information. Later, I tried to get his military attaché to discuss this issue with the War Department and asked our consular officials stationed in Germany to inform us of the results of British bombing of Germany at any time.

On June 24, I talked to Lothian again about the arrangements for the British fleet. He reiterated his suggestion that the appropriate army and navy officers of our two governments hold staff talks. Such a meeting would be extremely important if the British government had to retreat with its remaining fleet to Canada. But this could only happen in the event of British failure, which Lothian and I simply did not think of at the time.

I pointed out that, at least at this stage, the exchange of information was better conducted through diplomatic officials than through army and navy officers. What the President and I were concerned about was that the news of the military staff talks might "leak out" and allow opponents of the government and isolationists to accuse the President of trying to get the United States involved in the war.

A dramatic solution to the French fleet problem finally came on July 3, although the solution was only partial. At that time, the British took over the French warships stationed in British ports. They informed the French admiral commanding a squadron in Alexandria that they would sink them if he tried to take them to France and allow them to fall under German control. They also sent an ultimatum to a French admiral commanding a large part of the French fleet near Mers-el-Kébir near Oran in North Africa. The ultimatum required the French warships at Mers-el-Kébir to join the British fleet, or to sail to British, West Indian, or American ports to be detained. When the French admiral refused, the British opened fire immediately, rendering most of the French ships inoperable and killing more than a thousand Frenchmen. I felt indescribable grief and could not restrain myself from this tragic rupture between Britain and France.

A year and a half later, near the end of December 1941, Mr. Churchill was coming to visit the President. At one of the banquets given by the President in honor of this distinguished guest, I sat between the Prime Minister and a British admiral. This admiral asked me how I felt about the British attack on the French fleet in Oran. I evaded this question because I did not want to cause a dispute between him and Mr. Churchill, because I had heard that the British navy had opposed the invasion and that there had been considerable disagreement within the British government. But a few minutes later, I raised the subject with Mr. Churchill himself. He said categorically that the Vichy government could not be trusted and that it would hand over the fleet to the Germans if it was attacked. He also said that British prestige was at its lowest ebb at the time, and he wanted to use this action to raise it around the world, indicating that Britain was still going to fight.

Bullitt left Paris a few days after the German troops entered and met Pétain, Laval, Baudouin, and others in Vichy on July 4, the day after the British attack on the French fleet. He telegraphed me on the 5th that their reaction was extremely fierce. Some cabinet members advocated going to war with Britain immediately, but Pétain was firmly opposed to any action beyond breaking off diplomatic relations. Pétain said that only when Hitler was defeated by some other country could France regain its independence, so he sincerely hoped that Britain would win. He wanted to reduce the seriousness of the break with Britain, saying that it was due to Churchill's personal failure to weigh the pros and cons.

### A Bitter Pill: American Citizens Petition Truman

[Our Newspaper, New York, 3rd Dispatch] Billy Rose, a former typist with nimble hands, still holds the world record for high-speed typing. During World War I, he was Bernard Baruch's secretary. Since then, he has worked in many industries, especially making a name for himself in the Broadway entertainment scene. His performances at the New York World's Fair were particularly praised. In addition to performing, he also ran the highly regarded "Diamond Horseshoe" nightclub. He earned a great deal of money and became quite wealthy. Recently, he has been writing, penning as many as five columns a week. The following translation is one of his recent letters, from which one can see how close the relationship between the American people and the President is.

Dear President,

From where I stand, it seems that the electors are not preparing to let you continue renting that Shevanee Street apartment. Everyone is aiming for a goal, and when they achieve it, as seen in the last election, they vote for someone else. Mr. President, the reason I am writing to you is because I want you to continue living in the White House. In my eyes, you are undeniably

a good man

, and I think you have good intentions. I suspect the people of the country generally hold the same view. But frankly, we are all somewhat uneasy. We know our country has some problems, although we don't know exactly what they are. When you are sick, you don't feel well, and you need a doctor who knows how to prescribe the right medicine.

The purpose of this letter is to suggest that you summon such a doctor and bring him into the White House, so that he can prescribe a remedy whenever the government is unwell. And there is only one such doctor that the people trust. That is our old friend Mr. Baruch. He has been taking the nation's pulse and telling us why it is beating too fast or too slow for thirty years. Unfortunately, we

have not taken all his prescriptions

, because that old doctor will prescribe a nasty bitter pill when he deems it necessary. If the news that the old gentleman is living next door to you gets out, it will certainly boost morale and improve your political chances. I don't think Mrs. Truman would object either. Mr. Baruch is a very up-to-date citizen, with the demeanor of a Southerner, and looks kind. He doesn't drink, never drops ashes on the carpet, and is known for his generosity in tipping. I think he will definitely enhance your reputation.

I know you will agree that you would have found it very convenient to have that old doctor at your side for the past two months. You have to deliver the annual

State of the Union Address

in Congress, which is an important speech for any president. Undoubtedly, you and the staff in the White House drafted this speech all night. What was the result of your collective efforts? A clumsy proposal to give forty dollars to everyone who votes for you in the next election. It's like telling a cancer patient to take an aspirin every time it rains.

A few days after you delivered your speech, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee consulted Dr. Baruch about his thoughts on the Marshall Plan and several other issues. Our old statesman put forward a detailed and thorough world recovery plan. In just three thousand words, he told us about inflation, prices, wages, and other

world problems

and how to handle them. The only newspaper that published his prescription was "The Wall Street Journal," which made you realize how brilliant a doctor Baruch is!

But getting back to the main point, let's talk about that old doctor living in the White House. If you had been drinking orange juice with him for the past two months, that Baruch plan would probably have become the Truman plan by now.

Let me give you another example to illustrate how valuable this old doctor would be to the White House. Recently, many people have opposed your desire to build

a balcony

in the White House. If Mr. Baruch lived with you, things would be much easier. "We need this balcony so that our old friend can sit there and bask in the sun and come up with designs for us." That reason alone would be enough, and even many people who trust this doctor would volunteer to supply wood and nails and insist on building that balcony.

Am I suggesting that you shouldn't reuse the bright young things in the White House who are helping you now? Absolutely not. I've seen their pictures, and they all seem like good kids. In fact, they will also find it convenient after Mr. Baruch comes in. The old doctor likes chocolate soda, and in the summer, other colleagues will be happy to go to the drugstore to buy him a bottle. Mr. President, please think about it, if you went to the drugstore yourself, you might get a lot of votes.

### Blazing War in Northeast: Factories and Mines Deep in Peril

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th Dispatch] The Northeast possesses the most dazzling mineral deposits in Asia and is the foundation of China's industrial development. The Northeast is China's lifeline. This is not just an emotional cry, but a rational theory. Unfortunately, after the restoration, 70% of the industrial and mining equipment was dismantled and removed by the Soviet army. The remaining parts were subsequently disrupted and damaged by the communist bandits, causing even greater damage. After two and a half years, the Northeast's factories and mines have been shrinking day by day, and today they have reached a precarious state. The Chinese people should rise up urgently to reverse this historical trend.

To rescue the Northeast's factories and mines, the primary issue is to quell the rebellion, because this is the disinfection work to heal the wounds of the factories and mines. The factories and mines can only survive in stability. At present, the Northeast is in a state of war, and the banditry has not yet ended. The situation of the factories and mines is extremely dangerous. Leaving aside the misfortunes suffered by private factories and mines, even the state-owned factories and mines, the National Resources Commission operated in the Northeast

light and heavy industries and mines

including twenty-six units, were established separately after October of the thirty-fifth year, started production, and quickly sought to recover, thriving. By May of the thirty-sixth year, they had recovered to a considerable extent, and the future was very promising. Unfortunately, after May of that year, the banditry was rampant, and the factories and mines were the first to suffer, all suffering heavy losses, and the wounds deepened day by day. Up to now, most of the mines are unable to continue production due to environmental pressures, and cannot "sit idly by and consume resources", so they have decided to shrink and lay off employees. According to the current situation of each mine, there are five states: continuing to start work, maintaining the status quo, temporary custody, waiting for resumption of work, and closing down the institution:

Those who continue to start work

are the Fushun Mining Bureau, the Northeast Electric Power Bureau (Fushun and Fengman power plants), Benxi Coal and Iron Company, Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Company, Shenyang Rubber Factory (Rubber No. 1 Shoe Factory, Rubber Belt Factory, and Automobile Tire Factory), and the Northeast District of the Telecommunications Office. Six units in total.

Those who maintain the status quo

are Central Machinery Company Shenyang Machinery Factory, (the factory's original operating conditions were the best among all units, but now there is no sales of products), Shenyang Rolling Stock Factory, Central Electrical Equipment Factory, (only the motor repair shop is open), Shenyang Chemical Factory, (product caustic soda hydrochloric acid sales are stagnant), Liuning Cement Company, (only the Benxi factory is working), and Hanxin Coal Mining Company. Six units in total.

Those in temporary custody

are Beipiao Coal Mining Company (Jinzhou), Yingcheng Four Mines Receiving Committee (Changchun), Yantai Coal Mine (Fanyang), Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Northeast Metal Mining Company, Central Insulation Equipment Company Fushun Factory, China Petroleum Corporation Northeast Rotten Oil Factory (Jinxi), Liaoning Pulp and Paper Company, and North China Cement Company (Jinxi). Nine units in total.

Institutions to be abolished

There are three units: the Northeast Branch of the Xi'an Coal Mining Company Materials Office and the Shenyang Branch of the Insurance Office.

Huludao Sulfuric Acid Plant is waiting for resumption of work. Sulfuric acid is the mother of the chemical industry. The reason why the plant stopped work in the past was due to transportation difficulties and lack of containers for products. Now that these two problems are solved, production will be resumed soon.

The above is the true face of the industrial and mining industry in the Northeast, the cradle of war. Don't ignore today's crisis and its impact on the future. Mr. Fu Mengzhen said: "With the Northeast, China is like India; without the Northeast, China is just Italy." These are really alarming words. Professor Fei Wenzhong, after returning from his inspection of the Northwest, wrote an article expressing his feelings, believing that the Chinese people's vision for industrial construction should be shifted from the Northeast to the Northwest. His view of "reaping in the evening" is difficult for those who understand the resources of the Northeast to agree with. Just ask the engineers who went south from the Northeast and they will know. Today, what we regret is not only the trampling of industrial and mining equipment and the harm to engineering talents, but also the irreparable losses. (Our reporter Zhao Zhan)

### Distributing Rice: Poor People in Jiashan Celebrate the New Year

[Our Newspaper, Jiashan, 8th Dispatch] The county's Winter Relief Committee is actively carrying out relief work.

### Relieving the Spring Famine: Jiangsu Province Plans to Regulate Food for the People

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 12th Dispatch] Food in various counties of Jiangsu Province is in short supply due to inconvenient transportation, and because the security of the production areas in northern Jiangsu has not been fully established. The spring famine is approaching in a blink of an eye. The province is preparing early to avoid shortages. The Land and Food Department has formulated a plan to regulate food for the people, which has been approved by the provincial government meeting. The main points are three: (1) Request the central government to allocate a large sum of money to purchase food and provide relief to Jiangsu. (2) Relax food loans so that food merchants can directly purchase from rice-producing areas. (3) Order all counties and cities to establish food regulation committees to organize fair prices to help the people's food. This plan has also been reported to the Executive Yuan by the provincial government and consulted with relevant departments for record.

### Xiaoshan Trains Militiamen

[Our Newspaper, Xiaoshan, 10th Dispatch] The training of national soldiers has not been suspended due to the arrival of the Spring Festival. There are currently 2,000 young men undergoing training in the county. Also, the first phase of conscription in the 37th year, all thirty-six townships and towns are urging the conscription day and night, as urgent as fire. Each family allowance is 16 million yuan.

### Changhua National Congress Representative Election: Zhejiang High Court Declares Invalid

[Our Newspaper, Changhua, 13th Dispatch] Wang Xuequan, a specialist of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, previously participated in the election of National Congress representatives in his native Changhua County, Zhejiang. During the election period, the Changhua County Election Office violated the law and committed fraud, which ultimately led to his defeat. Afterwards, he collected relevant documents and filed an election lawsuit with the Zhejiang High Court in accordance with the law. After several court debates, the Zhejiang High Court believed that the fraud was true and ruled the original election invalid before New Year's Eve and should be re-elected. It is the first time in the country that the election of National Congress representatives has been ruled invalid by the court due to fraud. It is reported that Mr. Wang Xuequan was very excited after hearing the verdict and has prepared for the second election. (Special reporter Fang Zheng)

### Changzhou North Township: Conscription Turns Into a Full-Scale Fight

[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 12th Dispatch] Sanhekou and Xin'an Towns in the northern township of this county previously competed fiercely for the election of senators after merging townships. The sense of grievance among the people of the two townships has not been eliminated until now. This time, the township was merged, and Sanhekou Town insisted on merging the two baos of Dongyao and Xiyao, which originally belonged to Xin'an, into Hekou. Xin'an Township firmly refused, and the matter went to the Civil Affairs Department, but a satisfactory solution has not yet been reached. This time, in the emergency conscription, Sanhekou Township was allocated four quotas. When the deadline was reached, no soldier was conscripted in the township. In order to achieve success, the county government specially sent a military instructor, Xu, to the town to urge the conscription. Zhu Yuting, the head of the township of the township, said that three young men from Sanhekou could be sent to the city, but one from Dongxiyao had to be picked up by the instructor himself. Instructor Xu, after learning the situation, personally led four members of the Hekou Self-Defense Force to Dongxiyao Village early in the morning of the 7th, carrying a box gun. They tied up the old Bao chief Yao and brought him back to Hekou to hand over the young men. The whole village was in an uproar and rushed to report to Xin'an Township. Local people, more than a hundred people, rushed to Sanhekou, destroying the grocery store opened by the head of the township Zhu Xingting. Zhu Xingting fled through the back door and was not beaten. They recognized the instructor Xu and the four members of the Self-Defense Force as kidnappers and arrested them. Two members of the Self-Defense Force, seeing the situation was bad, abandoned their guns and fled one after another. The other two members of the Self-Defense Force failed to escape and were arrested. The instructor Xu was interrogated one by one. When the Xin'an contingent arrived at Sanhekou, the township self-defense force of Hekou East Street and the county security team of West Street were dispatched to guard the area and set up machine guns. The situation was like facing a formidable enemy. Fortunately, no disaster occurred. The Xin'an people were only watched swarming away. Afterwards, Sanhekou reported to the county government, accusing Xin'an of riot. Both sides are actively dispatching troops and preparing for a major lawsuit. As of the time of writing, Instructor Xu has been released and returned to the city. The 8th was a Sunday and the end of the lunar year, and the county government has not yet taken any emergency measures.

### Former Changshan County Chief Yu Zhongbiao Accused of Corruption

After being transferred to the Qu County Prosecutor's Office for investigation, the investigation has now been concluded, and it is believed that Yu Zhongbiao and Ma Hualong, (Chief of the Finance Section of Changshan County Government) have conclusive evidence of guilt and have been prosecuted.

### Chaoxian Baojia Chief Colludes with Bandits: Searched and Executed on the Spot

[Our Newspaper, Chaoxian, 8th Dispatch] The Bao chief and Tian chief of Dazhu Village and Dacao Village on the north bank of Chaohu Lake colluded with bandits. On the 25th of last month, the bandit suppression troops passed through the two villages and searched for traitors. They found conclusive evidence of harboring bandit troops in the home of the Zhu Cao Bao and Tian chiefs, and immediately reported to the upper echelon for approval to execute the Cao Bao and Tian chiefs on the spot.

[Our Newspaper, Kunshan, 12th Dispatch] Wang Maolin, a cadre of the No. 12 Bao Office in the model town of the urban area, extorted money from Chen Wenmo, a resident, and has been sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the court.

### Pingyang Xiagou Bridge New Sluice Gate to be Built on the 1st of Next Month

[Our Newspaper, Pingyang, 8th Dispatch] The county government recently played the province construction office, ordering that the Xiagou Bridge new sluice gate in Nangang should be planned and built as soon as possible, and completed before the spring plowing to benefit irrigation. After receiving the telegram, the county government decided to start construction of this large-scale water conservancy project on March 1.

### Baoshan Military Service Handled Poorly: Fu Zhengmo Sends Personnel to Investigate Secretly

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Recently, a reader wrote to this newspaper, exposing the corrupt situation in the handling of military service in Baoshan County. After the reporter went to the local area and visited the people on the spot, it was found that there were indeed incidents of catching young men from house to house and illegally embezzling in this conscription. For example, in the Sixth Bao of the county, an old woman surnamed Zhao was imprisoned by the county government because her son was selected and absconded, and has not been released to this day. In addition, Xu Genquan, a young man who was selected in Beimen, was the only son of several houses. After being arrested this time, his family was extremely panic-stricken. After negotiation, 15 million yuan was used to redeem Xu Genquan. There are many similar situations. The reporter specially visited Commander Fu Zhengmo of the Shanghai Division District for this matter and told him what he had seen and heard in Baoshan County. The commander said that regarding the alleged illegal corruption in the handling of Qiu service in Baoshan County, the department has already sent Colonel Inspector Lu Zhengqi to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. According to the investigation results, Xu Genquan is a young man who is solely responsible for the family's livelihood. Because he did not go through the procedures for deferring enlistment in accordance with the law, he was selected and enlisted. Later, 33 million yuan was released. Wang Zhongwu, the mayor of the town, and Qiu Baozhong, the deputy mayor, are indeed suspected of promising money. Mayor Wang is currently being detained by the county government for interrogation. In addition, a certain Zhao was imprisoned by the county government because his son was selected and absconded, which is also a fact. As for the allegation that many more family members were implicated in this conscription and many similar fraud cases occurred, because the investigation has not yet obtained conclusive evidence, it is still difficult to consider it a fact. Fu Zhengmo solemnly stated: The department has strictly ordered the Baoshan County Magistrate to investigate and deal with the corrupt and illegal persons in accordance with the law and report them. In the future, in addition to ensuring that all localities strictly abide by the laws and regulations in the conscription of new recruits, it is hoped that all sectors of society will provide as much factual information as possible to the department for reporting if they have any opinions on military service or find any illegal corruption. If the investigation has conclusive evidence, it will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law. Regarding the responsibility of the family members of the deserters, Fu said that the local authorities can question their family members, and arbitrarily detaining them is not in accordance with the law. If a man who is solely responsible for the family's livelihood applies for the procedure first, he can defer enlistment. In addition, in the department's conscription this year, except for Taicang County, which is collecting applications and implementing them, all other counties are publicly drawing lots, and everything is done legally. After the new recruits enter the camp, reporters are especially welcome to visit, so that with the help of the public opinion community, the military administration can be promoted smoothly and achieve perfection.

### Elaborate Plots with Guns and Narcotics: A Kidnapping Case Shocked Chengdu – Middle School Student Arrested as Abductor

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 8th] The academic atmosphere in Sichuan Province is increasingly deteriorating, with school-related violent incidents occurring frequently. The Chengdu Garrison Headquarters of Sichuan Province cracked a major middle school student kidnapping case on the 4th in Chengdu, which has now drawn significant public attention.

Student Kidnapped

Deng Guozhang, a resident of Chengdu, once served as a division commander in the Sichuan Army. His son, Deng Yongbao, aged fifteen, is currently a student at Shude Middle School in the city. On the 30th of last month, he was invited by a classmate to see a movie, but he never returned. While Mr. Deng was anxiously searching for him, on the afternoon of the 31st, he suddenly received a letter in Yongbao’s own handwriting, stating that he had been kidnapped by bandits but was safe. The letter requested a ransom of one hundred million yuan, to be delivered by the lotus pond in Zhongzheng Park by dusk the next day. Mr. Deng sent someone as agreed, but they found nothing. On the 2nd, he received another letter, more stern in tone, claiming that the bandits had detected secret police tracking them the previous day. It demanded that he prepare the ransom by 7:00 PM the following day and bring it to the Sun Yat-sen memorial monument in Zhongshan Park. The messenger was to shine a flashlight on the monument's clock three times to signal their arrival, and then negotiations for the ransom could begin for the release of the hostage, otherwise the hostage would be killed.

Plotting to Capture the Bandits

Given the gravity of the situation, Mr. Deng immediately reported the matter to the Provincial Capital Garrison Headquarters for investigation. After a thorough study by the Investigation Division, it was determined that the bandits were audacious enough to demand ransom in the most bustling area of the city, indicating that they were likely members of a major gang. Consequently, the entire Detective Brigade was mobilized, deploying hundreds of machine guns and new-style weapons. That night, hundreds of officers tightly surrounded Jiashan Park, lying in ambush. Mr. Deng was instructed to create a mock ransom of one hundred million yuan using small denomination notes, which was secretly placed near the monument to lure the bandits. As night fell, a short, dark figure was seen sneaking into the park, pacing back and forth by the monument. After repeated hesitation, the figure shined a flashlight on the giant clock at the top of the monument three times. At a signal, the officers emerged from their hiding places and immediately apprehended the bandit. It was discovered that the major bandit was wearing only a student uniform made of coarse gray fabric, carrying a schoolbag and in full student attire. The bandit was only a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old middle school student. Amidst the astonishment of the crowd, the bandit was taken into custody for interrogation. The bandit stubbornly refused to reveal the truth, only stating, "I am a homeless wanderer, without a livelihood, unable to attend school, and was forced to resort to this desperate measure. Now that things have come to this, I beg for execution as punishment." Subsequently, after persuasive encouragement from Commander Yan of the police division, the bandit finally confessed to being Bao Yulin, a student in the junior high division of Mingzhang Middle School, and that the hostage was being held at Jing'an Villa (the most luxurious hotel in Chengdu). That midnight, the division dispatched several officers to search the hotel. They successfully rescued the victim, Deng Yongbao, and apprehended another innocent-looking young student bandit who was guarding the hostage. This student, only thirteen or fourteen years old, was Bao Yulin's younger brother, Bao Yuzhi.

Strange Arrangement

After the entire case was solved, the police division conducted a thorough investigation. According to the testimonies of the three individuals, the details are as follows: The Bao brothers are both from Zhejiang. They came to Sichuan as refugees with their parents during the Anti-Japanese War. Their parents passed away years ago, and they have been wandering in Chengdu ever since. Deng and the Bao brothers were classmates at Mingzhang Middle School last year, but they had not been in contact for half a year. On the 29th, Bao Yulin suddenly visited Deng, falsely claiming that his family had wired fifty million yuan to Chengdu and asked Deng to deposit it in a reliable bank on his behalf. The next day, he invited Deng to the Rongguang Theater to see the movie "A Great Detective of Dragon and Tiger." After the movie, he invited Deng to his room at Jing'an Villa. As soon as they entered the room, Bao Yuzhi suddenly emerged from behind the door, holding a gun in one hand to prevent Deng from shouting, and a handkerchief soaked with "chloroform" in the other hand. Deng was rendered unconscious for some time. Upon regaining consciousness, he was forced to write a ransom note, ultimately leading to his capture.

Various Blueprints

During the search of the Bao brothers' room, the police found a handgun, a bottle of "chloroform," several detective novels, and a copy of "The Complete Book of Con Tricks." It is alleged that these served as blueprints for the young bandits to orchestrate this elaborate kidnapping case.

After the case was revealed, the public believed that it was caused by the decline in academic atmosphere and the failure of social education, launching a united attack on the education authorities. At the same time, the police division faced a thorny issue in sentencing these juvenile offenders, and they may be transferred to the court for handling. Another account suggests that the victim, Deng Yongbao, had a very poor reputation in terms of character and academics, and it is possible that he colluded in his own kidnapping. However, the Deng family and the police division have firmly denied this.

### Students Returning from England – After Completing Studies

[British Information Service, Shanghai] Several Chinese students who received scholarships from the British Council in 1945 to study in England have now returned home after completing their studies. Below are the students' academic backgrounds and their research in England:

Dr. Sun

A graduate of the West China University Medical School, which relocated to Chengdu. The teachers he worked under during his two years in England were leaders among British surgeons. Dr. Sun recently studied at the University of Edinburgh in mid-June, selecting a surgical research course. He was very popular among his colleagues in the hospital and visited Sweden to tour hospitals before returning home.

Hu Chuanxing

A graduate of the Mathematics Department of National Central University in Nanjing. He studied at the University of Manchester for two years in England, engaging in general mnemonic research under the guidance of Professor Newman. He visited Cambridge once during those two years.

Chinese students in England during the war, as well as scholars who went to England immediately after the war, are now gradually returning home. These scholars were the best non-official ambassadors of China while in England. Their professors were very impressed with their abilities, and they were well-liked by their colleagues. There is no lack of future Chinese leaders among them. They have received good training and will assist in the reconstruction of China.

### To Prevent Confusion Among Needy Students – Li Ximou Makes a Statement – Association of Needy Students Found to Be an Illegal Organization

[Our Dispatch] Recently, an organization calling itself the "Association of Needy Students" has been releasing news in the newspapers. Our reporter inquired about this with Li Ximou, director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, who made the following statement: "The Bureau has only seen the name 'Association of Needy Students' in the newspapers. After a thorough investigation, no such organization exists among needy students in this city who have received uniform scholarships or free schooling. The Bureau of Social Affairs has also not seen this organization apply for registration. It is clear that this is an illegal organization of a few individuals with ulterior motives. As for the association's claim that elementary school tuition fees will reach over 2.5 million yuan next week, this is even more of a fabrication, intended to create confusion. Because private school fees have not yet been determined, the Bureau is confident that the school authorities will take into account the burden on parents and set reasonable figures. As for the 25% free quota in each school, this was decided by the Municipal Council and has been accepted and implemented by all schools. It has been included in the schools' total income and will not affect teachers' salaries, so there is no need for further changes. The uniform scholarship is jointly donated by enthusiastic members of society and will be increased as the actual amount received increases. There is no need for needy students to make additional demands. Needy students in this city who cannot obtain a reduction or exemption can apply for the uniform scholarship. In this way, those who cannot afford tuition fees will be able to receive assistance and will not have to drop out of school. As for the so-called private school teachers not receiving in-kind allowances, this is a regulation of the Executive Yuan that applies throughout the country, and this city cannot make an exception. Moreover, this has nothing to do with needy students. Overall, what the spokesperson of the so-called Association of Needy Students says is mostly sensational slogans that disregard the actual situation and even contradict themselves. We are confident that the honest and poor students in each school will not be confused by them and allow them to achieve their ambitions of manipulation and exploitation."

### West China University – Highest Number of Students

Ranks First Among Thirteen Church Universities

[Shenzhou News Agency] The China Christian Educational Association of this city recently released statistics on the number of faculty, staff, and students, teaching hours, and male-female ratio in the thirteen church universities nationwide, as well as figures from before and after the war. The statistics on the increase in students in each university after the war compared to before the war are as follows:

Name | Pre-War Enrollment | Post-War Enrollment
------- | -------- | --------
Yanjing | 824 | 797
Qilu | 659 | 587
Jinling | 930 | 1,116
Ginling College | 259 | 341
Soochow | 800 | 1,238
St. John's | 611 | 1,744
Hangchow | 528 | 874
Shanghai | 1,150 | 1,534
Central China | 192 | 447
West China | 393 | 2,083
Huping | 174 | 601
Huainan | 100 | 223
Fukien | 450 | 1,005

General conclusions show: (1) Except for Yanjing and Qilu universities, which saw slight decreases in student numbers due to transportation issues as they relocated from Chengdu back to their original sites, the number of students at the remaining universities increased significantly. West China University had the highest number of students with 2,083, while St. John's University in this city was second with approximately 1,744. (2) The number of students at Huainan Women's College and Ginling College is relatively low. They should explore collaboration with neighboring universities to jointly establish departments to reduce financial burden. Ginling College and Nanjing University already have such a collaboration. (3) The faculty-student ratio has significantly increased after the war, averaging 1:9.6.

### Basketball League Tonight – Hualian Faces Shantou Geng Again – 7:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium

The third basketball league will have three Class A matches starting at 5:30 PM today, still held at the gymnasium of the Municipal Gymnasium. Hualian of Class A Group 1 will face the Oil Team again. The schedule is as follows:

Indian vs. Chenbai (Class A2A) 5:30 PM

Xiqinglü vs. Jiashen (Class A2B) 6:30 PM

Hualian vs. Oil Team (Class A Group 1) 7:30 PM

In the match between Chenbai and Indian, both teams have no hope of winning the championship in this group, and both have forfeited once, so their scores are equal. The outcome is irrelevant to the overall situation. It is hoped that both teams will maintain sportsmanship and not prioritize winning or losing. In the second match, Jiashen faces Xiqinglü. Jiashen leads the pack in Class A2B, remaining undefeated. The group championship is within reach. However, with Encas's support, Xiqinglü's tactics are novel and their stamina is abundant. Jiashen must be cautious and go all out if they want to remain undefeated. Jiashen's players are young, strong, and experienced, such as Wang Jieping and Tao Rongshi. They should be able to defeat the opposing soldiers and triumph.

In the final match, the undefeated Hualian of Class A Group 1 will face the Oil Team, starting at 7:30 PM. In the first encounter, the Oil Team was defeated. They are eager for revenge tonight, but their strength is far inferior. It will be difficult for them to compete. The only hope is for the Oil Team to lose by fewer points. Hualian's recent form has been excellent. Since defeating the Da Gong New Army, their training has become more dynamic. They have the ambition to retain the championship throne. Tonight, although their main player Li Zhenzhong has left Shanghai for Hangzhou, the team's lineup is still complete. They can still unleash their power and give the Oil Team a head-on blow.

(Hualian): Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuechong, Ren Xiangcheng, Liu Fushan, Qin Xunze, Zhang Liangxiong, Liang Xueling, Kong Guangyi.

(Shantou): Lin Weicong, Chen Qingjiang, He Lide, Zheng Guifang, Ji Nankang, Ma Canxi, Zhou Bin, Lin Zicheng.

### Record of Shanghai Team's Unprecedented Defeat in the 21st Interport Football Match: Hong Kong Team Uses Three Players to Mark Little Huang Mao; Zhang Banglun's Outstanding Performance Saves Many Dangerous Balls

[This Newspaper, Hong Kong Airmail] With superhuman speed, skillful coordination, and accurate shooting, the Hong Kong team defeated the Shanghai team 5-1 in the 21st Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match, suffering an unprecedented defeat. Several of the Shanghai team's star players failed to reach their usual level, allowing the Hong Kong team, led by Gausano, to easily win the victory.

Shanghai Team:

Zhang Banglun

Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang

Han Longbo, Qu Yongfu, Gao Baozheng

Li, Sun Jinshun, Robert Stoff, Xia Tixian, Fei Chunhua

Hong Kong Team:

Tan Junqian

Gao Shanlong, Hou Rongsheng

Zhang Jinhai, Flower, Liu Songsheng

Zhu Yongqiang, Keena, Deng Yijie, Zou Wenzhi, He Yingfen

Arrived at the Stadium Half an Hour Before the Match

The goddess of fortune did not favor the Shanghai team. Star player Robert Stoff only arrived in Hong Kong by plane from Shanghai half an hour before the match, rushing to the stadium in a hurry, still out of breath. Of course, a few minutes of practice was not enough. But he still fought hard. Because his reputation was already well known in Hong Kong, he scored two goals for the Shanghai team in the previous match, so this time three major players were assigned to mark him, preventing him from performing to his full potential, otherwise the situation would not have been so bad. Of course, the Hong Kong team played well, but it was also due to the Shanghai team's poor performance.

The match was held at Happy Valley on Tuesday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, with approximately 8,000 spectators. Many friends who could not buy tickets stood on the rooftops and hillsides to watch the game, making it a grand occasion.

The weather was fine, and the field was slightly muddy after the rain. The Shanghai team, in white jerseys and blue shorts, entered the field first, followed by the Hong Kong team in blue jerseys and white shorts. At 3:30 p.m., the match began with the playing of the British national anthem. The Governor of Hong Kong shook hands with each player, and the referee blew the whistle to start the game.

Shanghai Team Misses Golden Opportunity

The Hong Kong team kicked off and invaded the Shanghai team's territory. Wu Qixiang cleared the ball with a long kick, driving back the Hong Kong army. The Shanghai team counterattacked, forcing a corner kick, but without success. In the fourth minute, the Shanghai team had a golden opportunity. The entire team attacked the Hong Kong team's goal, but Fei Chunhua's soft kick went wide to the right, which was a pity. In another attack, Robert Stoff passed to Sun Jinshun, whose iron leg shot was too accurate and landed in Tan Junqian's hands. Two good chances, if successful at the time, would have changed the situation.

After failing to attack twice, the Hong Kong team also began to press forward, while the Shanghai team's coordination gradually became disorganized, even collapsing completely. The Hong Kong team attacked, and the situation became critical. Zhang Banglun rushed out to clear the ball, leaving an empty goal, but Deng Yijie missed the shot.

Hong Kong Team Scores Two Consecutive Goals

In the fourteenth minute, Zou Wenzhi, the right inside forward of the Hong Kong team, scored with a long shot, flying into the corner of the Shanghai team's net. Zhang Banglun was unable to save it. Five minutes later, the Hong Kong team scored the second goal. Zhang Banglun and Qu Yongfu collided with each other, leaving an empty goal. Deng Yijie, like a horse freed from its reins, scored easily.

Having scored two consecutive goals, the Hong Kong team gained confidence, boosted the entire team, and controlled the entire field. Yan Shixin was warned by the referee for dangerous play. The Shanghai team was penalized with a free kick, but without loss.

Fei Chunhua Finally Scores One Goal

It was not until the thirty-ninth minute that the Shanghai team scored its only precious goal of the game. Wu Qixiang kicked a long ball directly to Xia Tixian, who passed it to Fei Chunhua on the right wing. Little Fei rushed straight to the goal and scored with a low shot. The goal revived the entire team, but it was only a fleeting moment. The Hong Kong team's forwards pressed forward, and Zhang Banglun was overwhelmed. In the first half, the Hong Kong team led 2-1.

Wu Qixiang Penalized with a Penalty Kick

In the second half, the Hong Kong team became even sharper. The Shanghai team's territory was full of enemy cavalry, with fierce attacks. Zou Wenzhi and He Yingfen attacked on the right wing, and the Shanghai team was busy defending, opening a loophole on the left. Keena, the left inside forward of the Hong Kong team, scored the third goal.

Just two minutes later, Wu Qixiang was penalized with a penalty kick, which Zou Wenzhi kicked in, making the score 4-1, and the Shanghai team's situation was dire.

Sun Jinshun's Left Leg Was Injured

To make matters worse, Shanghai team captain Sun Jinshun injured his left leg and had to leave the field. In addition, Old Sun could no longer participate in the matches in Hong Kong. The Shanghai team's occasional attacks were merely embellishments. Robert Stoff got a header, but it did not go in. The Hong Kong team's forwards cooperated beautifully, and center forward Deng Yijie finally scored the fifth goal from eight yards in front of the goal. With five minutes remaining, the spectators were already leaving, expressing great disappointment with the Shanghai team. If it were not for Zhang Banglun's efforts to save dangerous balls, the Shanghai team would have lost by even more. The Shanghai team's performance was very unusual, but the entire team had indeed done its best. The Hong Kong team's speed was too high, making it difficult to cope with.

### Taiwan Brown Sugar Will Be Exported in Large Quantities This Year

In Taiwan's sugar industry, white sugar is operated by the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corporation. The company also produces brown sugar (赤砂), but the output is not large. Most of the manufacturers in the province are private manufacturers of Taiwan red sugar (brown sugar), which is known for its pure quality. The raw material for sugar production is entirely sugarcane, which is directly produced by new-style machinery. This year's output is about 120,000 dan. In the future, in addition to supplying the province, it will also be exported and sold in large quantities. The Taiwan Provincial Red Sugar Industry Association, in order to determine the name and differentiate it from the brown sugar (赤砂) and green sugar produced by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, has named it "Taiwan Red Sugar". It is reported that the association has asked the Taiwan Provincial Federation of Commerce to forward a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform sugar merchants to pay attention.

### Intense Competition Between Bulls and Bears: Domestic Stocks Flourish

Although domestic stocks were weak in the middle of the day due to the heavier burden of interest rates and the exit of bulls from securities firms, the Guangdong firms stopped selling and started buying after 11:30 a.m., reversing the trend and becoming bullish again. In the end, buying and selling competition was fierce, and silver was pulled higher.

The opening was slightly strong. Wing On Cotton Mill appeared at 730 yuan and 761 yuan. Numbers 89, 134, and 154 were immediately delivered after buying in, and numbers 23 and 55 were delivered on a deferred basis, with prices rising to 742 yuan and 767 yuan. Numbers 23, 163, 103, 126, 202, 35, 60, 116, 152, and 69 were sold immediately after the order was placed, and numbers 76, 169, and 178 were delivered on a deferred basis. The off-site interest rate was still 3 jiao 1.5 fen and 3 jiao 6 fen, requiring a two-day burden, and the price fell back to a low of 723 yuan and 742 yuan. Numbers 231 and 180 maintained their position at the low price and then turned around. After 11:30 a.m., the Guangdong firms started buying in, with numbers 202 and 155 strongly buying, and numbers 18, 35 also being delivered immediately, and numbers 14 and 8 being delivered on a deferred basis. The buying of number 202 was the most urgent, and the price rose back to a high of 754 yuan and 768 yuan. Numbers 231, 160, 183, 197, and 157 took the opportunity to close out, and the closing price at noon was finally settled at 739 yuan and 760 yuan. The remaining stocks were also mediocre. Only New Kwong, King Fook, and Lum Kum saw some action. As a result, compared to the previous close, the stocks for immediate delivery, including Meier, Riant, Underwear, Sino-French, New China, Rong Fung, and Textile, were flat. Five Harmony increased by half a percent, China Cement fell by half a percent, and Wing On Cotton Mill, Hua Feng, New Kwong, King Fook, Sino-, Zhabei National Goods, Shinho, Tung Yih, Matches, Wing Kong, and Keen Hing declined slightly. For deferred delivery stocks, Shinho and Keen Hing were still flat, Wing On Cotton Mill, New Kwong, and King Fook rose slightly, and Hua Shi Feng fell slightly.

### After the Implementation of the Public Treasury Law, Salt Tax is Directly Deposited into the Treasury

[This Newspaper] It is reported that the Ministry of Finance originally stipulated that the salt tax should be collected first by the purchasing salt people and then calculated daily by the General Affairs Agency in the supervision and operation account set up in the designated bank, and then transferred to the national treasury, which was a temporary measure. Now that the Public Treasury Law has been implemented for some time, the tax payment should be directly paid into the treasury by the taxpayer. It is specially stipulated that merchants should directly deposit the tax into the treasury. The procedure is that the salt affairs agency fills out the payment form in accordance with the law and hands it to the merchant for direct deposit into the treasury, in order to comply with the law.

### British Foreign Trade in 1947

— Special Correspondent, Ben Geng

(I)

Foreign trade is a very important part of the overall economic problem of the United Kingdom. Now let us take a look at the situation of British foreign trade in 1947:

The following figures represent foreign trade in 1947 and its comparison with 1938 (pre-war) and 1946. (Unit: thousands of pounds).

Year　Imports　Exports of Domestic Goods　Re-exports of Imported Goods　Trade Deficit

1938　919,509　470,753　61,323　587,229

1946　1,501,030　914,699　50,269　336,062

1947　1,787,471　1,157,083　59,267　591,221

The United Kingdom has always been a country with a trade deficit in foreign trade. According to statistics, the export figure for 1947 was the highest since 1920, and two and a half times that of 1938. However, this is in terms of the value of the pound. In reality, due to rising prices, the quantity of exported goods did not increase as much. Details of the current price increases have not yet been released. However, it is estimated that the quantity of exports in 1947 was approximately 108 percent of the quantity in 1938. In other words, the increase was less than one-tenth. The goal of the United Kingdom is to increase the quantity of exports to 140 percent of that of 1938, because this is necessary for the United Kingdom to have a sufficient amount of imports to improve the people's living standards. As can be seen from the situation in 1947, the situation in each quarter was not the same, approximately as follows: (Unit: thousands of pounds)

Quarter　Imports　Exports of Domestic Goods　Re-exports of Imported Goods　Trade Deficit

1st Quarter　363,650　249,659　18,197　95,794

2nd Quarter　455,518　264,876　17,770　172,872

3rd Quarter　517,398　302,449　21,311　203,818

4th Quarter　450,905　320,099　12,069　28,737

From the above table, it can be seen that the trade deficit in the last quarter of these four quarters showed a decreasing trend. According to statistics, the quantity of exports in the fourth quarter of 1946 was 111 percent of that of 1938, falling to 101 percent in the first quarter of 1947, 102 percent in the second quarter, 114 percent in the third quarter, and 117 percent in the fourth quarter. In other words, although the quantity of exports for the entire year of 1947 was only 108 percent of that of 1938, the main reason was that the figures for the first and second quarters were too low. The particularly low figures for the first quarter are generally said to be related to the particularly cold weather in the United Kingdom in the first three months of 1947, as well as the coal shortage, which affected transportation, thus affecting exports for the entire year.

(II)

As for the types and amounts of imported and exported goods, it is also worth taking a look. First, let us look at the situation of imported goods in 1947 and its comparison with 1938 and 1946. (Unit: thousands of pounds)

Type of Goods　1938　1946　1947

Food, Tobacco, and Beverages　430,117　637,478　805,427

Raw Materials and Unfinished Products　248,213　390,218　559,823

Finished Products and Semi-Finished Products　233,522　245,271　399,424

Animals Not Used as Food　3,318　7,145　7,726

Parcel Post Imports　4,339　20,918　15,071

From the above table, it can be seen that the bulk of the United Kingdom's imported goods is food, tobacco, and beverages, which is the main reason why the UK's trade deficit problem is difficult to solve. Food is an absolute necessity, but judging from the situation in each quarter of 1947, the import of food, tobacco, and beverages also showed a decreasing trend. The average monthly import in the first quarter was 61,557,000 pounds, in the second quarter it was 71,321,000 pounds, in the third quarter it was 76,202,000 pounds, but in the fourth quarter it decreased to 59,395,000 pounds. (Note: The above figures for each quarter are the average monthly import figures for food, tobacco, and beverages in each quarter.)

(III)

The situation of exported goods is as follows: (Unit: thousands of pounds)

Type of Goods　1938　1946　1947

Food, Beverages, and Tobacco　35,803　63,684　64,725

Raw Materials and Unfinished Products　56,921　33,013　34,207

Finished Products and Semi-Finished Products　365,245　789,110　998,877

Animals Not Used as Food　679　3,758　3,574

Parcel Post Exports　12,017　25,134　35,700

The situation of exports is the opposite of that of imports. Exports are mainly finished products and semi-finished products, while the quantities of exports in the first item (food, beverages, and tobacco) and the second item (raw materials and unfinished products) are not important in comparison. This situation also shows that the United Kingdom is an industrial country. However, it is not difficult to imagine the difficult situation of an industrial country whose people's living standards have already been raised to a very high level and which lacks food. From the above table, we can also see that the solution to the UK's economic problems still requires effort. (Note: The figures in this article are based on the Board of Trade Journal, Volume 154, Number 2666, published by the British Board of Trade on January 24 of this year. What is reported in this article is the value of imports and exports. Under the circumstances of frequent changes in prices, the quantity of imports and exports is very important. Once the authorities publish it, another report will be made.) (London, night of January 27, 1948.)

Culture and History

### On the Word "Xiu" in Yi Inscriptions

— Tang Lan

In the spring of the thirty-sixth year, Yang Yufu's "Explanation of Poems on Yang Wang's Xiu" was published in the thirteenth issue of the Wen Shi Zhou Kan of Ta Kung Pao. Based on the usage of the word "xiu" in bronze inscriptions, it corrected Deng Jian's interpretation of "xiu" as beauty and the misinterpretations of bronze inscription scholars since the Song Dynasty. He said that Zheng Kangcheng's interpretation of the word "xiu" as beauty was "superficial and irrelevant," and he interpreted it as "bestowed." "Dui Yang Wang Xiu" means "to answer and praise the King's bestowal." In ancient pronunciation, "xiu" is the same as "hao," and "hao" also means "bestowed." He also used five evidences based on bronze inscriptions to prove that "xiu" should be interpreted as "bestowed."

I think Mr. Yang's conclusion is a bit too hasty. The word "xiu" can certainly be interpreted as "bestowed" in some places, but this interpretation cannot be used everywhere. The meaning of a word has multiple aspects. The problem with general philologists is that they often regard the meanings of words as independent and rigid, without integrating them. The same word "hao" is interpreted as "beautiful" or as "bestowed," as if there is no connection between them. Mr. Yang said:

"Xiu" should be read as "hao." The "Daming" of the Xiaoya in the Book of Poetry says, "Hao is upright," and Deng Jian says, "Hao is like 'yu' (to give)." The seventh year of Duke Zhao in the Zuo Zhuan says, "Hao to greatly yield," which means to bribe with a great yield. The "Nei Zai" of the Zhou Li Tianguan says, "Whenever the king bestows meat preserves, the Nei Zai share it." "Hao bestowed" is used together, so "hao" also means "bestowed." Zheng's note, "what the king favors and bestows," is wrong.

Mr. Yang's citation of the Book of Poetry is too much of a selective interpretation. The fourth chapter of "Xiaoming" says, "Be respectfully diligent in your position, and uprightness is given." The fifth chapter says, "Be respectfully diligent in your position, and 'hao' is upright." We can easily understand why Deng Kangcheng said "'hao' is like 'yu'," because the meaning of these two chapters is similar. If it were not for the rhyme, the fifth chapter could also say "uprightness is 'hao'," and the sentence structure would be the same. In philology, "A is like B" means that the meanings of A and B are similar, but it cannot be said that A is B. Even if the word "hao" can be interpreted as "yu," here it is only the "yu" of "dangyu" (to participate) and "xuyu" (to allow), not the "yu" of "bestowed." The "Zheng Min" of the Daya says, "The people hold to their norms, and 'hao' is virtue," which has exactly the same sentence structure as "'hao' is upright." This simply means "to be pleased with," and is only similar in meaning to the "yu" of "dangyu" and "xuyu," but it cannot be said that "hao" is "yu."

It is acceptable to interpret the "hao" of "hao to greatly yield" as "bribe," and it is also acceptable to interpret "hao" as "bestowed" because the "li hao bestowed" is used together. But we should not reject other meanings of the word "hao." The "hao" of "hao to greatly yield" still contains the meaning of "to rejoice in and form good relations." The Zhou Li often uses "hao bestowed" together, and the Nei Fu also uses the three words "hao bestowed yu" (give) together, but they still have their own distinctions. The Wai Fu says, "The wealth used for the bestowal of yu," but does not mention "hao." The Taizai says, "The models for 'hao' usage," and Zheng Xuan notes, "Gifts for banquets and good relations," which shows that "hao" is not usually the same as giving. The Nei Zai notes, "Hao bestowed, what the king favors and bestows," which is not wrong, except that it combines the two words "hao bestowed" into one meaning.

The ancient pronunciation of the word "xiu" was similar to the word "hao," and they have the same etymological origin. Mr. Yang's reading of "xiu" as "hao" is not a problem in itself. The problem is that the word "xiu" should not be limited to the meaning of "bestowed." Because from our point of view, the interpretation of "xiu" as "beauty" is the same as the interpretation of "hao" as "beauty."

Mr. Yang cited many evidences from bronze inscriptions, such as the Xiao Chen Yi, which says, "Chasing Uncle bestows upon Xiao Chen three strings of cowries, three families of Chen, in response to this bestowal." He said that the word "xiu" above can only be interpreted as "bestowed," and then said, "If the following 'dui jue xiu' is interpreted as 'in response to this beauty,' wouldn't it be ridiculous?" There is also the Xiao You: "The king bestowed fifty strings of cowries upon the duke, and the duke bestowed twenty strings of King Xiu's cowries upon his son Shezi Xiao." This is dividing twenty strings of cowries to benefit Xiao from the fifty strings of cowries that the king bestowed. Above it says "bestowed," and below it says "xiu." There is also the Hao Shu Lü Zhong, "The Son of Heaven bestowed much Lü's xiu," and "The Son of Heaven bestowed much chase's xiu." "Bestowed" is a verb, and "xiu" is a noun. There is also the Da Bao Yi, "The king gives the Da Bao xiu and remaining land," and Bian Shi Yi, "Xiu bestows Bian Shi cowries." "Bestowed xiu" is used together, and "xiu bestowed" is used together. We acknowledge that in these evidences, the meanings of "xiu" and "bestowed" are similar.

But Mr. Yang is too rigid. He says:

Examining the phrase "dui yang wang xiu" in bronze inscriptions, it must be the reason for the creation of the vessel. The ruler rewards his subordinates, and the subordinates create vessels to record the event as glory. This is what is meant by "praising the ruler's bestowal." If it is said "praise the ruler's beauty," rewarding subordinates is a common thing for a ruler. What beauty is there to speak of? This is judging from the principles of things, and it can be known that it must not be so.

We really don't understand why he separates "glory" and "beauty" so clearly. From the ruler's point of view, the ruler's reward to his subordinates may be a common occurrence, but from the point of view of the subordinate who receives the reward, it should be glory, that is, the ruler's good intentions. Therefore, he should praise his "beauty." This is very common and easy to explain. Mr. Yang simply regards the words "xiu" and "hao" as rigid, and can only interpret them as "bestowed," so he also regards praising the beauty of the ruler as only general virtues and cannot interpret it as specifically targeting someone's good intentions.

From the point of view of philology, besides the meaning of "rest and stop," the Erya Shigou interprets "xiu" as "beauty," Shiyan interprets it as "celebration," and Guangya Shigou interprets it as "joy." It has always been interpreted only as "beautiful" and "joyful." Even from the point of view of bronze inscriptions, the word "xiu" is not only used as "bestowed." There are some places where it should still be interpreted as "beauty," and "dui yang wang xiu" is also like this. Before discussing this point, we must also involve another important issue.

There is a 卣 in the bronze ware, with the inscription "Xiu Wang bestowed three Lü on Xiao Father, and used it to make his precious zunyi." There are also three ding with similar inscriptions. Guo Moruo wrote in the Da Xi of Liang Zhou Jinwenci that "This is a vessel of King Xiao's time. Xiu Wang is King Xiao. In ancient times, xiu and xiao were homophones." At that time, a large number of people believed this view. For example, Mr. Wu Qichang based on the "Xiaoyang ye" of Shiming Shiyanyu and the "Xiuyang ye" of the Yujizao Zhengyi of the Book of Rites to support Guo's view. On the Chronological Table of Bronze Inscriptions, it is said that "Guo Jun proposed that Xiu Wang was King Xiao. Qichang repeatedly considered it and could not change his theory in the end, so he followed it and elaborated on it to strengthen his proof." But I think it is very dangerous to rely solely on the similarity of sounds without other evidence. I think the "xiu" of Xiu Wang is only a verb, not a personal name, and I have discussed it with Mr. Guo. Later, Guo Guang Sheng's revised edition of the Da Xi Kao Shi said under the Zhao You:

"Xiu Wang is King Xiao, the younger brother of King Yi. In ancient times, xiu and xiao were homophones. King Xiao was originally called Xiu. Later, in the legend, he was transformed into Xiao. The Xiao Father Yi and the Yi Father Ding also saw "Xiu Wang." Tang Lan said, "Xiu is a verb. The Zhao Gao says, "Now Xiu Wang does not dare to lag behind, using concern and fear for the people," which can prove it. There are many examples of this in ancient times, such as saying "The Emperor of Lu's command," where Lu is also a verb. To praise the Emperor or the King of Lu Xiu, and call him "Xiu Wang" or "The Emperor of Lu," the meaning is the same. The Xian Fei Yi says, "Xian Fei Min Yang Bo Mu Father Xiu, saying: Xiu Bo Wu Mu Su Xian Bo Shi," Xiu Bo is also like Xiu Wang." Now, according to the two vessels alone, Tang's theory is also acceptable. I also suspected that Xiu was an adjective at first, so in the article on the origin of posthumous titles, all the vessels that mentioned "Xiu Wang" were not referred to. Now that this vessel is read, the verb adjective theory cannot be applied. If it is read as "Zhao Jinqi's affairs, running to serve the Emperor, Xiu," it seems to be acceptable, but the Fangyan Qi Jin already has Cheng, and the logic is difficult to articulate, so this reading cannot be applied. In the Zhao Gao, I still think it is appropriate to follow the old reading and interrupt the sentence with "now Xiu," and the following "The King has a successful command to govern the people, now Xiu, the King first served the Yin Royal affairs, similar to my Zhou Royal affairs" is also the same. Now Xiu refers to the good fortune given by Heaven. The "Xiu Bo" of Xian Fei is also the name of Bo Qun Fu, probably because Xiu Wang is called Xiu, and Bo Qun Fu is also called Xiu."

Guo Xianwang first acknowledged that my theory was acceptable, only because the sentence of Zhao Gao was not applicable to verbs or adjectives, so he still said that "Xiu Wang" was King Xiao. In fact, the Zhao Gao says, "Xiu Wang personally destroyed the envoy to reward Bi Tu, fifty li in the square." Apart from the one point of sending people to reward from the place of Zi Gu, what is the difference in grammar between Xiu Wang rewarding Bi Tu fifty li in the square and "Xiu Wang bestowed three Lü on Xiao Father" or "Xiu Wang bestowed cowries on Yi Father." If those two inscriptions can be understood, then Zhao You cannot but be applicable. As for saying that "Xiu Bo" is the name of Bo Qun Fu, it feels even more far-fetched.

In the years 1937 and 1938, a new bronze vessel was unearthed, the Mu Gong Ding, and the inscription says:

Mu Gong created the Yin Gu ancestral temple in Mu Lin. In the sixth month, the Yi Mao after the Ji Sheng Ba, the Heaven King does not forget Mu Gong's holy spirit and bright virtue. Serving the former kings, each in the Yin Gu ancestral temple Yao Lin. The King does not offend Yin Gu Li, bestowing jade five grades, horses four pairs. Bow down and kowtow, to praise the Heaven King's Xiu, use to create reality.

"'Xiu Tian Jun Fu Wang Mu Gong' is praising the Heaven King for not forgetting Mu Gong." Xiu is a verb, and my theory is fully explained here. Praising Wang Xiu can become "Xiu Wang," Zhao Yang Bo Xiu can become "Xiu Bo," and praising Heaven King Xiu can become "Xiu Heaven King." Then, Xiu Wang will never be a personal name, and will never be King Xiao.

From this issue, we know that "Xiu Wang" is converted from the sentence structure of praising Wang Xiu. Then, the meaning of the word Xiu should not be limited to bestowal. Because praising Wang's bestowal can still be barely understood, if "Xiu Zheng bestowal" is interpreted as bestowing King bestowal, it would not be logical. The Xiu You says, "Zhao does not dare offend Wang Xiu Yi," hence the linked text is the King's good intentions and Yi number. It is also incomprehensible to interpret Xiu as bestowal here.

The root meaning of Xiu Xue is beauty, not bestowal. However, bestowal is always a good intention, so the word Xiu is used as good intention bestowal, and over time, it is simply used to explain bestowal. The word Ming itself does not have the meaning of bestowal, but it is often used in this way in ancient books and ancient vessels, which is an excellent example.

Therefore, "dui jue xiu" in Xiao Chen Yi may as well be "dui jue mei" (in response to this beauty), which is not ridiculous. "Dui Yang Wang Xiu" in the Book of Poetry may as well be "dui yang wang mei" (in response to the King's beauty), and is not "superficial and irrelevant." Mr. Yang's evaluation is prejudiced and has nothing to do with textual research itself. In our research on philology, we must focus on the entirety of word meanings and pay attention to their development, and not be guided by superficial meanings. Mr. Yang and others proved from bronze inscriptions that the word "xiu" can be interpreted as bestowal, which is a very good discovery, but we must clearly recognize that this is only a special extended meaning. If we rashly use this philology on everything that can be interpreted as "beauty" and try to correct them, it will become "one slip in a thousand thoughts."

### The Native Place of Cao Xueqin's Family

— Hu Shih

Mr. Yang Xiangkui sent a letter from Shandong University asking whether the author of Dream of the Red Chamber, Cao Xueqin's family, was from Fengrun County, Hebei Province. Mr. Yang quoted this paragraph from an article by Mr. Ping Zong entitled "Cao Xueqin's Native Place" published in the Qingdao Min Yan Wan Bao (December 23):

"When the Qing Dynasty entered the Pass in the early days, most of the Han people from Liaodong who surrendered were assigned to the Han military banner. Cao Xueqin, the author of Dream of the Red Chamber, was one of them. The Imperial Dynasty General History and the General Genealogy of the Eight Banners both say that they lived in Shenyang for generations, but they do not know that the Cao family's original native place was Fengrun County, Hebei. You Tong's Gengen Qi Wenji "Song Ci Poetry Draft Preface" has "Cao Zi Li Xuan, a native of Fengrun," etc. According to Li Xuan's name Yin, Zi Ziqing, is Xueqin's grandfather. From this, it can be seen that Xueqin's ancestors were originally from Fengrun. His name Shenyang is probably a registered residence..."

Mr. Yang Xiangkui is from Fengrun, so he is very interested in this issue. He said in his letter: "Fengrun had four major surnames in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, namely Gu, Lu, Cao, and Chen. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Manchu people entered the Pass, and Fengrun was a must-pass place. Many people were captured. The Cao family may have been captured at this time and became bondservants, and then planted Shenyang people... There are also Duanfang who were originally from Fengrun in the Han military banner and said to be from the Northeast. Duanfang's surname is Tao, and he is from the north of Fengrun city. Later, he was in the banner, so he was mistakenly called Shenyang. The Cao family may also be like this."

Today, Mr. Wang Chongmin kindly borrowed You Tong's "Gengen Qi Juan" from the Peking Library on my behalf. I checked the "Song Ci Poetry Draft Preface" and realized that Mr. Ping Zong had misread this text. The preface did not say "Cao Zi Li Xuan, a native of Fengrun." The original text is:

"Cao Zi Li Xuan and I are friends of different ages. His poems are desolate and melancholy, forming his own family. People sent his brother Chonggu to travel to Wumen, and he was able to read his Song Ci Poetry Draft. It is true that the brothers are good at the arena, and they are all the later strengths of Yecheng... I have already made friends with Chonggu, knowing that he is a native of Fengrun. Fengrun is a strong county in Jingji... I once served as Si Li in his territory... and was crowned as the Fifth Grand Historian and received education... I heard that the Grand Historian was tired of putting Minglu, and served as a large prefect, one in Huizhou, two in Fengxiang, and three

In Guangxin. And Chonggu was in Zishe, often following him with a sword..."

This does not say that Cao Yin (Li Xuan) is from Fengrun, but only that a Cao Chonggu is from Fengrun County and is the son of Cao Guan Wu Taishi. The preface says "Now Zhi Nai Brother Chonggu has traveled to Wumen," which can only be interpreted as "Cao Li Xuan introduced his brother Chonggu to visit Suzhou." It said "The brothers are good at the arena, and they are all the later strengths of Yecheng," which is a general allusion to the Cao family, and does not mean that they are really from the same family. Therefore, You Tong, Cao Yin's "friend of different ages," did not know the native place of this "elder brother" until he "made friends with Chonggu" and "knew that he was from Fengrun."

That "Guan Wu Taishi" is Cao Dingwang, who was a Jinshi in the sixteenth year of Shunzhi, was selected for the Hanlin Academy, and served as a prefect for three terms. The Jinshi title record says that he is from Fengrun County, Shuntian Prefecture. Chonggu is his son and is certainly not Cao Yin's brother. Cao Yin's father was called Cao Xi, who was born as a bondservant and served as the Jiangning Weaving Envoy for twenty-two years. Cao Yin did not have an elder brother, only a younger brother, Ziyou, who is also mentioned in You Tong's "Cao Tai Furen Sixty Shou Xu" and "Dong Ting Fu." His family tree does not have a person who became a Jinshi or a Hanlin academician. According to Volume 74 of the General Genealogy of the Eight Banners, Cao Yin's great-grandfather Cao Xiyuan "lived in the Shenyang area for generations, and there is no record of the year he came to surrender." You Tong wrote the preface in the year Bingzi of Kangxi Thirty-five (1696 AD). Counting up to Yin's great-grandfather, it should have been before the Chongzhen period of the Ming Dynasty. We can only say that Cao Xueqin's family history, counting back six generations, cannot be considered Fengrun County people. (Cao family genealogy quoted from Hu Shih Wen Cun Volume 3, page 844) Whether Cao Xiyuan went from Fengrun is something we cannot determine now. But this preface by You Tong is not enough to prove that his family is from Fengrun, only that Cao Yin once recognized the Fengrun poet Cao Chonggu as a brother of the same family.

In the future, Mr. Yang Xiangkui may be able to seek out the poems or genealogy of the Cao family in Fengrun from this clue, which may help answer this question.

### "Two-Sided Arguments" of the Old Faction of the Northern Song Dynasty

— Guo Guangming

— Concurrently Examining Sima Guang's Initial Advocacy of the Substitute Labor Law —

During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, the laws and institutions established in the early years of the Northern Song Dynasty had already produced many malpractices. Especially after being invaded by Western Xia, the Song Dynasty concentrated the nation's manpower and material resources to cope with the situation, yet still often felt that its ability to resist was insufficient. At this time, not only were military weaknesses fully exposed, but weaknesses in civil administration and finance also became fully apparent. Fan Zhongyan carried out a new policy during the Qingli years (1043-1044) but failed. Subsequently, the general trend forced Wang Anshi's reform during the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong (1068-1077).

After Fan Zhongyan's failure and before Wang Anshi came to power, most scholars and officials concerned about politics still believed that political economy and military affairs should be reformed at that time. For example, Su Shi, who was greatly known for his literary talent at that time, believed that "if you want to bring the world to great governance," there must be a reform that "greatly corrects the customs of the world." In the late years of Renzong, he wrote a book to offer advice, discussing the grand plan of "pacifying the people, enriching wealth, and training soldiers," and suggested "equalizing households, comparing taxes, teaching battle and defense, establishing military systems, training military strength, and advocating courage." He also made specific plans to control Western Xia and Khitan, and even exaggerately said: "If you use my words, you can even take Khitan in the north." In Zhu Xi's words, he really looked like he "was desperate to come out to tidy up the corruption."

After Emperor Shenzong ascended the throne, he was determined to enrich the country and strengthen the army. Wang Anshi came out to take on the important task of changing the laws and systems, regarding financial management as the primary task. He created various new laws for this purpose, disregarding everything and forcefully implementing them. However, "reforming abuses in long-term peace," long-standing habits were difficult to change suddenly. Therefore, when the new laws were implemented, countless disputes and resistance were aroused in society, especially among scholars and officials. At this time, those who had previously advocated reform, and even some people who had participated in the initial work of Wang Anshi's reform, all turned back and retreated, changing or even abandoning their original opinions. Taking Su Shi as an example again, he saw that the Green Sprouts Law caused many disturbances, so he no longer talked about financial management; seeing Li Xian's failure in using troops against Western Xia, he no longer talked about raising troops. He completely reversed his previous arguments, and even said that he was afraid of causing resentment for selecting redundant soldiers, and thought it unnecessary.

In Zhu Zi's Classified Conversations, there are several articles recording Zhu Xi's criticism of Su Shi's contradictory arguments before and after. One article concludes: "He clearly has two-sided arguments."

In fact, among the so-called Old Party, Su Shi was not the only one who "clearly had two-sided arguments." It was only because Zhu Xi had no respect for Su Shi's character that he specifically criticized him. For example, in Zhu Zi's Classified Conversations, there are two other records:

"Lv's Family Tradition records that Duke Jing (Wang Anshi) and Duke Shen (Lv Gongzhu) were extremely friendly at that time, and the new laws were all discussed together, so Duke Shen was very much expected to help when implementing the new laws. Mingdao (Cheng Hao) was also used as the regulations division, all in the hope of the help of the sages. At that time, one can imagine his good intentions. Later, he completely betrayed his original intentions, so the sages all did not follow him."

"When the new law was implemented, the dukes actually conspired together, even Mr. Mingdao did not think it was wrong. Because at that time, it was also the time to change the times. However, later, people's feelings were turbulent, and Mingdao began to advise him that things that go against people's feelings should not be done. And when Wang's vigorously implemented it despite public opinion, Duke Nuo began to retreat and disperse."

Zhu Xi's two remarks are not very fair, because he is too partial to Cheng and Lv in the old faction. He believed that the division of the new and old parties was due to Wang Anshi "completely betraying his original intentions later." However, the facts told us the opposite. Since Wang Anshi entered the government and created new laws, his style and intentions have truly achieved the point of "consistent from beginning to end." What he did later was to implement his "original intentions" of reform. It may be that he failed to fully realize his "original intentions" because of various obstacles. It is truly slander to say that he "completely betrayed his original intentions." Zhu Xi clearly said that "the implementation of the new law was actually conspired by the dukes together," and Cheng Hao's participation in the farmland water conservancy law in the implementation of the new law, as one of the eight envoys sent to various places at that time, is even a well-known fact. Lv Gongzhu had not only discussed the new law with Wang Anshi, but Sima Guang's diary recorded that Guang had discussed with Emperor Shenzong in person in April of the third year of Xining about Lv Gongzhu's reversals:

"Lv Gongzhu is indeed guilty, but not today. In the past, the imperial court entrusted Gongzhu with the responsibility of recommending officials from the Taiwan, but he recommended all the people from the regulations division, and they supported each other, making it so rampant. Then, he was forced by public opinion to say that it was wrong. This is what can be condemned." (According to the Record of Famous Officials' Words and Deeds) This shows that Lv was originally a person who vigorously supported the implementation of the new law at the beginning, and it was later that he "was forced by public opinion" that he changed his attitude again.

From the above, it can be seen that the reason why the relationship between Cheng and Lv and Wang Anshi deteriorated later was not Anshi's fault at all, but Cheng and Lv were afraid of "the turbulence of people's feelings" and "forced by public opinion," and then "completely betrayed their original intentions," completely betrayed the new law and Wang Anshi. So, are these two people not also "clearly have two-sided arguments"?

Other figures in the old faction, such as Han Qi and Fu Bi, were all people who started reform with Fan Zhongyan during the Qingli years. After that reform failed, they continued to point out the shortcomings of the tax system and the foreign peace and war policies at that time, as well as the need for improvement. However, when Wang Anshi implemented the new law, they joined forces to undermine it. Fu Bi even advised Emperor Shenzong of Song to "not mention military affairs for twenty years." Compared with the spirit of courage in the past, it is truly like two different people. Ye Shi of the Southern Song Dynasty said in his preface to the Xixue Jiyan:

"Ouyang Xiu said that Bi was intelligent and decisive, which was when he first held power, but it was not the case after he became prime minister. When Bi first held power, his intention to change was greater than Fan and Han. When he became prime minister, he thought it was right to stick to everything and not do anything. Even if Qi slightly changed, he could not follow it. The ancient virtuous prime ministers became more enlightened due to worries and difficulties, such as the Duke of Zhou; Bi became more faint due to worries and difficulties, and he still wanted to think of himself as virtuous, which I don't know."

If Zhu Xi's words are used, Han Qi and Fu Bi are of course "clearly have two-sided arguments."

Sima Guang, who opposed the new law the most and was later regarded as the leader of the old faction, also had "two-sided arguments." The most important items in the new law were the Green Sprouts Law and the Substitute Labor Law. When these two new laws were implemented, Sima Guang did his best to oppose them. After Emperor Shenzong died and Emperor Zhezong ascended the throne, Sima Guang took power, and these two laws, like all other new laws, were abolished by Sima Guang in turn. Before abolishing them, he called the Green Sprouts, Exemption, and Military Officer three new laws and the Western Xia invasion as the four evils, and said to others: "If the four evils are not eliminated, I will not rest in peace." It can be seen the extent of his hatred for these new laws. However, if we trace the history of the Substitute Labor Law, we can know that Sima Guang had already made this proposal several years before Wang Anshi created the Substitute Labor Law.

Volume 12 of the Wenxian Tongkao, Examination of Duties and Services 1, records:

"During the time of Emperor Yingzong, the admonishing official Sima Guang said: Since the establishment of the township household officers, the people have become more and more poor and exhausted, and dare not make a living. The rich are not as good as the poor, and the poor dare not seek wealth. I have traveled in villages and seen the insignificance of farmers' living tools and asked the reason, and they all said, "I dare not do it. Now, if I want to plant more mulberry trees, keep more cattle, store two years of food, and store ten bolts of silk, the neighbors will already regard me as a wealthy family and point out that I am an officer, let alone dare to increase fields and repair houses?"…"

"I think: Farmers should not be involved in anything other than rent and taxes. Officers should be recruited to do it, and they should be compensated with preferential treatment. If it is not enough, it should be done by the upper households in the city. The people in the city send convoys, manage warehouses, and do not cost two or three, but the farmers often cost eight or nine. Why? The nature of the wise and foolish is different."

After these two passages, Ma Duanlin attached an annotation:

"According to Duke Wen, this memorial was spoken during the time of Emperor Yingzong. The so-called recruiting people to fill the officers is the law of Xining. However, since it is called recruiting, there must be something to reward it. If this money does not come from the government, the people who should serve should pay it, then the assistance money is inevitable. Why did the scholars who discussed this matter at that time repeatedly disagree?"

We can analyze Ma Duanlin's simple annotation into three points:

1. During the time of Emperor Yingzong, Sima Guang had already suggested "recruiting people to fill the officers."

2. The method proposed by Sima Guang is actually equivalent to the assistance (recruitment) law implemented by Wang Anshi later.

3. It is a strange thing that Sima Guang opposed the assistance law implemented by Wang Anshi.

At this point, we can only quote Zhu Xi's words to explain: It is because Sima Guang had already "completely betrayed his original intentions" during the time of Xining, so he could not help but "have two-sided arguments."

The two passages of Sima Guang quoted in the Tongkao are actually not in the same memorial. Now, after checking, the first passage quoted by him is a passage from Sima Guang's "Notes on Officers," which can be found in Volume 38 of the Collection of Duke Sima Wenzheng. The second passage he quoted, "I think," and the following words, are a passage from Sima Guang's "Memorial on Wealth and Profit," which can be found in Volume 23 of the Collection of Duke Sima Wenzheng. Li Tao's Continued Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance, Volume 196, lists Sima Guang's "Memorial on Wealth and Profit" on the first day of May in the seventh year of Jiayou of Emperor Renzong (1062), which is two years earlier than the time mentioned in the Tongkao. It is only eight or nine years away from Wang Anshi's implementation of the Substitute Labor Law. Sima Guang should not have forgotten the passage in his "Memorial on Wealth and Profit," but he "completely betrayed his original intentions" and desperately opposed the Substitute Labor Law.

### Historical Discussion on Nanzhao (3)

— Xiang Da

— Various Books Recording Nanzhao in the Tang Dynasty —

This should be Hua Qixiu's Yunnan Travelogue, so it records his own experiences. The Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era 937 Jia Yu article quotes Yunnan Ji, recording the Jia fish of Bing Cave in Yazhou; 867 Tea article quotes Yunnan Ji, recording Mengshan tea in Mingshan County; 839 Rice article quotes Yunnan Ji, recording rice in Rongjing County, Yazhou; 942 Clam article quotes Yunnan Ji, recording women of Xin'an barbarians; 980 Radish article quotes Yunnan Ji, recording Zhuge vegetables produced in the boundary of Xuizhou; 958 Tuo article quotes Yunnan Ji, 974 Sugarcane article quotes Yunnan Ji, both mentioning Huichuan; 973 Yu Gan article quotes Yunnan Ji, also mentioning that there are Neng Ganzi on the south bank of the Lujiang River. The place names recorded above, including Yazhou, Mingshan, Rongjing, Xin'an, Xuizhou, and Huichuan, are compared with the route from Chengdu to the Nanzhao Barbarian King's Palace recorded in Chapter 1 of Fan Chuo's Barbarian Book. The place names quoted in Yunnan Ji are all on this route. There is a note in the sentence "Barbarian Book crossing the Lujiang River rope bridge" which says, "Yunnan Travelogue says Qusang Post." From this, it can be inferred that the author of Yunnan Ji, Wei Qixiu, entered Yunnan, probably taking the Qingxi Pass road, so he could record his experiences along the way. The places he passed and the Qingxi Pass road recorded in the Barbarian Book are the same. Yuan Zi entered Yunnan, taking the road from Shimen to Luwang Kunshan, that is, Youmenda, also known as the Five-Foot Road between Qin and Han, which is different from Wei Qixiu. Therefore, it is probably beyond doubt that the Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era quoted Yunnan Ji as Wei Qixiu's Yunnan Travelogue, rather than Yuan Zi's book. In addition to the 23 articles quoted in the Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era mentioned above, the original note under the sentence "Crossing the Rope Bridge" in Volume 2 of the Barbarian Book quotes one article, and the original note under the title of Volume 56, Yan Di 5, also records that Wei Qixiu's Yunnan Travelogue has ten examinations. In addition, the Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era 924 Parrot article quotes two articles from Yunnan Travelogue, one mentioning the Quqian Pavilion and the other mentioning the Xin'an City Road. The Quqian Pavilion cannot be verified, but the Xin'an City Road is still on the Qingxi Pass road, and it should be Hua Qixiu's book. Why the Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era quotes one book but divides it into two names is unknown. In addition, the preface roughly quoted by the Qunjing Dushu Zhi, Wei Qixiu's Yunnan Travelogue can be found like this only.

When Wei Shenggui and Wei Qixiu were sent to Yunnan in the third year of Changqing, at the same time, the Tang Dynasty announced that Du Yuanying, the Zhongshu Shilang and Tongping Zhangshi, would be appointed as the Jiedushi of Xichuan. Yuanying was the fifth grandson of Du Ruhui and entered the Hanlin Academy as a Jinshi. After Emperor Muzong ascended the throne, "he became prime minister in less than a year, and was sent out as the Jiedushi of Jiannan Xichuan, Tongping Zhangshi." After arriving in Xichuan, in order to cater to Emperor Muzong and consolidate his favor, he collected all kinds of treasures and dedicated them to the emperor, and abandoned the border defense without regard. As a result, in the third year of Taihe of Emperor Wenzong, Nanzhao launched a large-scale invasion, approaching Chengdu, and the treasures, handicrafts, daughters, and other things in Xichuan were wiped out. The Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance, Tang Dynasty, Volume 3, November, records that Nanzhao invaded Xichuan, saying

Yuanying was arrogant because he was a former prime minister and elegant scholar, and did not understand military affairs. He focused on accumulation and reduced the soldiers' clothing and food. The soldiers garrisoning the southwest border did not receive clothing and food, and they all entered the barbarian territory, where they robbed themselves to supply themselves. The barbarians used clothing and food to fund them. As a result, the movements in Shu were actually known to the barbarians. Nanzhao planned a large-scale invasion from Cuodian, and the border states repeatedly reported it, but Yuanying did not believe it. When Cuodian's troops arrived, the border city was unprepared...

Wei Shenggui and Wei Qixiu were sent to Yunnan in the third year of Changqing, taking the Qingxi Pass road. The states they passed along the way, such as Ya, Li, and Zhui, were exactly the road that Nan Shao invaded in the third year of Taihe. Du Yuanying garrisoned Shu, and the border defense was abandoned. I am afraid that it was influenced by Wei Qixiu's preface to the Yunnan Travelogue, which declared the abandonment of the areas outside Qingxi Pass. The false intelligence led to a great disaster. Later, Li Deyu became the Jiedushi of Xichuan and wanted to reduce Du Yuanying's crime by pushing the responsibility to Wei Gao more than thirty years ago, thinking that Wei Bi should not have made peace with Nanzhao, so the people were slack, and the border was unprepared, so there was the Taihe Rebellion in the third year. Today, it seems that Duke Wei's statement is not a fair one.

In the first year of Zhenyuan of Emperor Dezong, Wei Gao was appointed as the Inspector of the Ministry of Revenue, the Prefect of Chengdu, the Imperial Censor, and the Jiedushi of Jiannan Xichuan, replacing Zhang Yanshang. He sat in Xichuan for twenty-one years. According to the Song History Art and Literature Records, Wei Gao wrote the Southwestern Yi Affairs in twenty volumes. The twenty-one years of management must be recorded in detail in the book. Today, only the Zhenyuan 10th year of Dezong of the Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance cites an article from the Southwestern Yi Affairs, which is a mistake in the Biography of Wei Gao in the Old Tang History, and there is nothing else to verify. After Wei Gao, the famous person who garrisoned Shu was Li Deyu. Li Wengong's collection contains a record of Nanzhao's preparations for the border, which says,

When I was in Xichuan, I studied the advantages and disadvantages and collected some important places, which was actually a long-term plan. Therefore, I wrote the Southwestern Border Defense Record in thirteen volumes. The cities and towns I created are all included in the small map, and the equipment and armor are all included... The fourth volume describes the beginning and end of Weizhou, which seems particularly detailed... The New Tang History, Biography of Li Deyu, says that Deyu arrived in Shu.

He built a border planning building and drew a picture on the left of the dangerous terrain of the Southern Road and the mountains and rivers that entered each other, and a picture on the right of the Western Road that was connected to Tubo. The number of tribes, the distance of food supply, and the twists and turns are all included. He summoned those who were familiar with border affairs to point out, discuss, and revise with him, and he knew all the falsehoods of the captives.

Probably the terrain drawn on the left and right sides of the border planning building is included in the small map of the Border Defense Record. Deyu's collection is made in thirteen volumes, and the Song History Art and Literature Records is made in one volume. It is suspected that the Song History has an error. The Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance, Taihe 5th year of Emperor Wenzong, May, Li Deyu asked for 4,000 people who were plundered by Nanzhao. Deyu's Southwestern Border Defense Record, Deyu's book has been passed down, and only this one article. The New Tang History, Biography of Deyu, describes his planning in detail during his garrison in Shu. It is suspected that much of it is taken from the Border Defense Record.

### Evolution of Shanghai's Telephone Business

— Wang Dachun

Shanghai's internal telephones are divided into two major systems: one is the Shanghai Telephone Bureau directly under the Ministry of Communications, and the other is the Shanghai Telephone Company operated by American businessmen. In 1881 (the seventh year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), the British Oriental Telephone Company began to obtain the operating rights of Shanghai's telephones for a period of eighteen years. This was the beginning of Shanghai's urban telephone service. At that time, it was under the jurisdiction of the British Concession Engineering Bureau. In 1900, the British Shanghai Mutual Telephone Company was organized, which was an foreign-invested company. In 1929, the Chinese and foreign companies sold, and the American International Telegraph and Telephone Company (I.T. and T.) bought it and changed its name to Shanghai Telephone Company (S.T.C.), specializing in the telephone business in the old public concession, French concession, and their road-crossing areas. At that time, the number of telephone sets was 33,600. Since then, the concession has become increasingly prosperous, and the number of telephone sets has gradually increased. Although it was twice invaded by Japanese pirates in January 28 and August 13, the telephone sets were damaged. But since the victory, the number of telephone sets has increased to more than 70,000. The telephone operated by foreign businessmen was part of the Engineering Bureau during the era of the Engineering Bureau. People did not know how to use it. Only foreign firms installed telephones, and there were only hundreds of users. It was a magneto type. After the establishment of the Chinese and foreign companies, the central bureau was built, with 30,000 lines of shared telephone exchanges. The Xiqu Lushang Bureau also had 10,000 lines of shared telephone exchanges. After the Shanghai Telephone Company bought it, it expanded greatly, adding Fujian Road Bureau, Mintini Bureau, West Bureau, North Bureau, Huishan Bureau, Bixun Bureau, and Hongqiao Bureau, all of which were changed to Rotary Automatic Sytem. Since then, the company's business has become more and more developed.

When the telephone business in the concession gradually expanded, when its telephone sets crossed the scope of the concession and were installed outside the boundary, the Qing government, in order to maintain its sovereignty, began to establish the Shanghai Nanshi Telephone Bureau in 1902 (the 28th year of Guangxu), in an attempt to prevent the concession telephone from entering the urban area. At that time, the exchange was magneto type, with a capacity of 480 lines and about 200 users. The address was in Maojia Lane in Nanshi. In 1909 (the first year of Xuantong), when the Zhabei branch was opened, the number of users increased sharply. It was planned to build its own bureau building and change the exchange program. In 1922 (the 11th year of the Republic of China), the Nanshi General Bureau was built in Dananmen, with a shared telephone capacity of 2,000 lines. The Zhabei branch was built in Yongxing Road, with a magneto type capacity of 700 lines. The Pudong branch was built in Dongchang Road, with a magneto type capacity of 280 lines. Since then, Jiangwan, Wusong, Nanxiang, and Longhua branches have been opened. In 1929 (the 18th year of the Republic of China), in order to cooperate with the development plan of Greater Shanghai, it was decided to use automatic telephones and ordered 4,800 lines of Strowgre Step-by-step Automatic System. It was planned to install 3,000 lines in the Nanshi General Bureau, 1,500 lines in Zhabei, and 300 lines in Pudong. In 1932 (the 21st year of the Republic of China), on January 28, Japanese pirates built damage in Shanghai. The Zhabei, Jiangwan, Nanxiang, and Wusong branches were all damaged by artillery fire. After the war, the drawing power was restored. On April 15, 1933 (the 22nd year of the Republic of China), the automatic telephones of the Nanshi General Bureau and the Zhabei branch were completed. In 1934 (the 23rd year of the Republic of China), the 300 lines of automatic telephones planned to be installed in the Pudong branch were moved to the newly built city center bureau on Sanmin Road. The Pudong branch was changed to a shared telephone type, with a capacity of 600 lines.

Before the Anti-Japanese War, the capacity of each exchange of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau was roughly as follows:

Bureau Name, Program Type, Capacity

Nanshi Automatic Type 3000

Zhabei Automatic Type 1500

City Center Automatic Type 300

Longhua Automatic Type 150

Pudong Shared Telephone Type 600

Wusong Magneto Type 50

Dachang Magneto Type 50

Zhenru Magneto Type 50

Minhang Magneto Type 50

When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, the Wusong Bureau was the first to be destroyed. The Zhabei City Center, Pudong, Dachang, Zhenru, and other bureaus were all located in the war zone. The machinery was dismantled and moved to the concession for storage to avoid material losses. When the national army withdrew westward, the machinery of the Nanshi, Longhua, Minhang, and other bureaus was also dismantled and stored in the concession. During the Anti-Japanese War, the international situation changed drastically. The machinery dismantled and stored in the concession, except for a part that was transported to the rear, was all occupied by the enemy and puppet forces. The enemy's Huazhong Electric Communication Company occupied the urban area and operated telephones in the second year of the Anti-Japanese War. After the outbreak of the Japanese-American War, the company occupied the American Shanghai Telephone Company and formed the Shanghai Telephone General Bureau. When victory came, the Jiangnan Telecommunications Regulation and Restoration Office was ordered to take over Shanghai's telecommunications business. All the telephones in Nanshi, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the city center were taken over and reorganized, becoming the current telephone exchanges under the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau. As for the Shanghai Telephone Company, after the takeover, the property was returned to its original owner and returned to the merchant for operation.

### Miscellaneous Notes on the Telegraph Room of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

— Ning Yongsheng

The "telegraph room" is the business center of the telegraph department. It is in charge of the key to transmitting telegrams. The speed of telegram transmission is closely related to the telegraph room. There are now many types of machines used for receiving and sending telegrams in the telegraph room, such as teletypewriters, high-speed wireless automatic machines, high-speed wired automatic machines, facsimile telegrams, wireless manual machines, wired Morse machines, and wired sound machines. The amount of incoming and outgoing telegrams determines which type of machine is used for which circuit.

Originally, the "telegraph room" of the telecommunications bureau was divided into three parts. The "wireless fast machine telegraph room" and the "wired telegraph room" were installed on the floor of the Fuzhou Road General Business Office. Another part, the "wireless manual machine telegraph room," was installed in Yuyingtang Road, Zhabei, because the environment in Fuzhou Road was not suitable for receiving wireless manual machines. It was called the "Zhabei Branch." Originally, the telegrams between the General Business Office and the Zhabei Branch were sent through teletypewriters or messengers, as well as the necessary numbering procedures. There was one more transfer in between, which inevitably delayed the telegrams in time. The business managers of the telecommunications bureau had worked hard to remedy this problem. Now they have moved from creative planning to concrete - Manual radio receiving and transmitting remote control system - that is, to move the original "wireless manual telegraph room" in Zhabei to the floor of the General Business Office and merge it with the "wireless fast machine telegraph room" and the "six-line telegraph room," and change the Zhabei Branch into a receiving station for the wireless manual telegraph room; and to carry out remote control receiving and sending system in the same way as the fast machine telegraph room. In this way, the telegrams received by the General Business Office can be sent to the upper floor for transmission immediately, without having to be transferred to the Zhabei Branch by teletypewriter or messenger. The problem of time delay due to one more transfer in the middle has been ideally solved, and an average of about one and a half hours can be saved for each telegram. Based on the 4,000 incoming and outgoing telegrams per day from the eight circuits of Yongjia, Xi'an, Nanchang, Kunming, Chengdu, Shenyang, Xiamen, and Shantou, which were recently moved, the savings will reach about 6,000 hours, which should not be a small improvement! Following this creative improvement, five express telegrams were added in Chengdu, Kunming, Yongjia, Xi'an, and Nanchang, which of course gave users a lot of convenience.

### The Way to Send Express Telegrams

— Xu Dahai

In addition to Fuzhou Road, the Changzhi Road Telegraph Office is open, and recently the Shiliupu Office has also opened. Their accuracy and speed are exactly the same.

"Express Telegram" is the fastest type of commercial telegram. Unless there is a line failure, it is guaranteed to be delivered to the recipient within one and a half hours. As for the fee, it is the same as urgent telegrams, only adding 24,000 yuan for the "express delivery fee". In any case, the Telegraph Office always treats express telegrams differently. Because of this, there are many people sending "express" telegrams. If you don't believe me, look at the "express" window at the General Office of the Telegraph Office, where there is always a long queue every day, which is a loss for the senders in terms of time.

In order to remedy this shortcoming, the Shanghai Telegraph Office has worked hard and successively opened "Express Telegrams" at the demonstration offices at 25 Changzhi Road and 59 Limalu Road in Shiliupu. First, it can save citizens in those areas from having to travel to Fuzhou Road, and second, it can reduce congestion at the General Office and reduce time wasted.

Will an "express telegram" received from the demonstration office be delayed? No. When the receiver receives an "express" telegram, they will carefully look at it (if it has not been decoded, it will be decoded by the decoder), collect the fee, pay the receipt, and immediately send it directly to the report room of the General Office via telex, where the telegraph operator will send it to the receiving location according to the original telegram. The above procedures will be completed within a quarter of an hour. Its speed and accuracy are exactly the same as those sent from the General Office, and the convenience of fewer people sending telegrams sometimes makes it faster than sending from the General Office.

Understanding the above situation, people who know the way to send "express telegrams" will definitely run to the demonstration office to send them.

### Common Sense of Telecommunications (8)

— Zhang Jiayu

Lecture 3 How to Choose Special Services

Second type: If the sender indicates "Special Delivery" or the FS symbol at the beginning of the telegram, but the original telegram only lists the recipient's name and address in one place, it means that when the telegram arrives, if the recipient has already left the location of the receiving office, the Telegraph Office should inquire the original address to find out the recipient's whereabouts and new address, and continue to send the original telegram to the address until the telegram is delivered or no one continues to provide the recipient's new address.

For telegrams using the forwarding special service, each additional transmission will incur an additional fee. In addition to the fee for the first place listed in the recipient's address field, which is paid by the sender, the fees for the remaining sections will be collected from the recipient by the telegraph office at the recipient's location when the telegram is delivered. But one point is very important: that is, if the telegram has been delivered but the recipient is unwilling to pay, or the telegram cannot be delivered in the end, or in the second case mentioned above, the recipient's new address cannot be obtained in the end, then all the fees for the sections above the second section will still be collected from the sender. Therefore, when the sender adds the forwarding symbol, they must understand the responsibility they should bear.

(7) Change of Address Recently, the postal service has printed various promotional materials to promote postal common sense, which are affixed to the back of letters and sent to the recipients with the letters. A piece I just received is titled "The Post Office Asks for Your Cooperation," and below it says: "If your communication address has changed, please: (1) Notify your relatives and friends of your new address as soon as possible; (2) Before leaving, leave your new address with a friend who lives with you and ask them to forward it immediately. (The post office does not charge extra for forwarding the original mail). (3) If you have no acquaintance to entrust, please apply to the post office for forwarding mail."

Here, the "Change of Address" special service we are going to talk about is exactly the same in nature as "Forwarding Mail." As far as telegrams are concerned, if the communication address has changed, it is naturally best to notify all parties concerned of the new address in advance. In case of a hasty departure and no time to notify in advance, the new address should be left with family members or relatives and friends living together before leaving, and they should be asked to return the telegrams from various places to the local telegraph office and request that they be changed to the new address. If there is no acquaintance to entrust, you can also declare to the local telegraph office that the telegrams sent to you from various parties should be changed to the new address.

According to public habits, telegrams are usually not sent lightly unless there is a major incident. Therefore, for the sake of careful service, the Telegraph Office has to be more cautious in handling the procedures for changing the address of telegrams than the Post Office in handling the change of address of letters. To give an example, when you ask a friend who lives with you to forward the letters sent to you from various places immediately, as suggested in the second point of the postal service promotional material cited above, as long as you do not open the original envelope and cross out the original address written on the envelope, and add the recipient's new address (or write the recipient's new address on another piece of paper and stick it on the original envelope), you can immediately give it to the postman to take back or put it in a nearby mailbox, and catch up with the original forwarding. The procedure is quite simple. If you want to change the address of a telegram, the applicant for the change of address (referring to your family members or co-residents) must prepare a written application and apply to the local telegraph office before it can be accepted. If there is no acquaintance to entrust, you must also prepare a written application before leaving and apply to the local telegraph office to change the telegrams sent to you from various parties to the new address. Also, if the above application cannot be submitted in advance, you must wait until you arrive at the new place and send a paid public telegram to the telegraph office in the original place (referring to the telegraph office in the new place) to notify them to do so. The Telegraph Office must also require the person applying for the change of address to provide identification documents when necessary in order to be cautious.

As mentioned in the first lecture, the biggest difference between mail and telegrams in terms of billing methods is that mail is billed based on weight, while telegrams are based on the time required for transmission (i.e., the length of the telegram). Therefore, the Post Office stipulates that mail must be forwarded on the original flight in order to avoid additional charges, while the Telegraph Office charges an additional fee for each change of address of a telegram.

In principle, the change of address fee for using the special change of address service must be collected from the recipient when the telegram is delivered. If the recipient refuses to pay or the telegram cannot be delivered in the end, the Telegraph Office will collect it from the applicant for the change of address. However, for telegrams that only need to be changed to one place, if requested by the applicant for the change of address, the applicant for the change of address must pay the change of address fee in advance. If necessary, the applicant for the change of address can also request the Telegraph Office to change the telegram originally listed as an ordinary telegram to an urgent telegram for change of address, or change the telegram originally listed as an urgent telegram to an ordinary telegram for change of address, and prepay the change of address fee according to the changed telegram type.

The fee payment symbol for the change of address special service is "Changed from... (location)" or Recirected from... (place name), which is combined into one word when sending. Addresses that have been delivered but have not been delivered properly are omitted when changing the address. For example:

(Original telegram sent to Shanghai) Wang Daren, No. (2492), Nanjing West Road, Shanghai... (The telegram text and signature follow)

(First change of address to Hankou) Recirected from Shanghai Wang Daren, Xuan Palace Hotel, Hankou... (The telegram text and signature follow)

(Second change of address to Chongqing) Redirected from Shanghai Hankow Wang Daren, No. (536), Section 3, Zhongshan Road, Chongqing... (The telegram text and signature follow)

Finally, please do not misunderstand: the "change of address" mentioned in this section refers to changing the address to another place. If the recipient is only moving to another address in the same place, they only need to notify the Telegraph Office of the new address in advance to change the delivery, or simply stick a note on the door of the original address stating the new address, and the Telegraph Office's messenger will change the delivery to the address.

### Basic Knowledge of International Telegrams

— Shi Jinrong

Everyone who sends a telegram hopes to send it quickly, and it's true, and to pay less, but the hope is symmetrical, half on others, half on oneself. One should have a common sense of sending telegrams, how to send them quickly, what kind of telegrams are fast, how to avoid mistakes, how to remedy mistakes, and how to make them cheaper. This is what Shanghainese call the doorway. Please see below:

Where to Send International Telegrams

International telegrams are operated by international radio stations. In Shanghai, there are currently three business offices, namely the General Office in the Sassoon Building and two branch offices on Fuzhou Road and Sinan Road. If the sender feels that the distance is inconvenient, they can call 11120 to notify the international radio station to send an external business officer to collect the telegram between 10:00 am and 8:00 pm every day. No other fees are charged except for the telegram fee, but telegrams collected by telephone must be sent with cash and are not temporarily applicable to sending telegrams on account.

Which Telegram is the Most Cost-Effective

There are several types of telegrams sent for commercial and private purposes. Now I will add explanations to the name, price, and speed, and you will know at a glance.

Ordinary Telegram - Uses clear language, charges the full fee, and is the fastest to transmit except for official urgent telegrams.

Code Telegram - The telegram text uses a code composed of five letters, which is 60% of the full fee and is transmitted at the same time as ordinary telegrams, with a minimum of five words.

Urgent Telegram - Charges double the fee for ordinary and code telegrams and is sent in advance.

Deferred Telegram - The telegram text uses clear language, which is half of the full fee and is sent after ordinary telegrams, with a minimum of five words.

Letter Telegram - The telegram text uses clear language, which is one-third of the full fee. Night letter telegrams must be delivered on the morning of the day after the delivery date, and day letter telegrams must be delivered on the second morning of the delivery date, with a minimum of 25 words.

Among the above six types of telegrams, code telegrams are the most economical and affordable, costing only 60% of the fee, and are as fast as ordinary telegrams, and one code can include several sentences, so code telegrams can be regarded as cheap and good.

How to Use Time Difference

Everyone knows that the time is different between China and foreign countries. We eat lunch here, and New York eats midnight snack there. London goes to the office, and we are off work. So when we send telegrams to the United States during our office hours, it is already night in the United States. Unless they also work at night, it is cheaper to send deferred telegrams. When sending telegrams to Europe, we can send deferred telegrams in the morning, which happens to be their office hours. Of course, the above refers to normal communication conditions. If the work is not smooth and the telegrams are crowded, it should be considered separately.

Write Clearly

The letters UNVCI in English are most easily mistaken. Clear language can still be explained in detail, but code cannot be translated. So it is necessary to write clearly, so that it can be understood at a glance. Even when typing, it is best to use all capital letters. Place names, addresses, and numbers must be clearer. If there is one name and several places, be sure to add a clear note.

How to Send Free and Cheap Telegrams

Is it possible to send telegrams without spending money? Yes, if there are several empty and unclear meanings or some questions in the telegram you received, you can ask the radio station to send a telegram to inquire, without charging a fee. If you want to add to, correct, or even cancel a few words after the telegram is sent, you don't have to send another telegram. Just bring the receipt and ask the radio station to do it for you, and you will only be charged for the words you want to add, correct, or cancel. If there is no reply for a long time after the telegram is sent, and you want to urge the recipient to reply quickly, you don't have to send another telegram. Just bring the receipt and ask the radio station to do it for you, and you will only be charged for one word, which saves money and trouble.

### Notes on Looking at Paintings

— Jing Wen

Appreciating calligraphy and painting is an elegant matter for poets and literati. This sentence is neither commendatory nor derogatory, because painting is a top art. Without considerable cultivation, one is not worthy of talking about appreciation. The reason why this article is titled "Looking at Paintings" is to declare in advance that although I like paintings, I only have the qualification to look at them with my naked eyes and direct intuition. I cannot talk about appreciation. Moreover, because I am not worthy of appreciation, the paintings I like to look at are definitely not masterpieces that are not ingenious in the art world.

To say something that is not embarrassing, the paintings I like to look at are just what the country people call "foreign paintings." These days, there are many of these things on the roadside stalls or on the walls along the street, such as Zhu Bajie recruiting relatives, the 108 heroes of Liangshanbo, and the rat welcoming relatives. Although they are not elegant, I personally think they are worth seeing.

Although most of the audience of this kind of folk gallery are country people or children, judging from the smiles on their faces and the gestures of their criticism and observation, although they don't know what art is, their naive requirements for art are probably more emotionally genuine than the elegant audience in the famous painting exhibitions.

In recent years, there have been famous painting exhibitions in Shanghai from time to time. It is said that there are many people "supporting the show," and the higher the price, the more畅销the sales are. A "masterpiece" often has four or five red paper strips with "Mr. So-and-so ordered" stuck on it, which shows that art and culture are not as "declining" as generally said; however, looking at the advertisements in the newspaper, I feel that most of the sponsors of famous painting exhibitions are several familiar names. Probably because the art is becoming more and more advanced, the fewer people who appreciate it. Thinking of this, I can't help but feel sad for the art.

I have said that appreciating profound art requires a considerable degree of cultivation; however, the meaning of art's existence is probably not limited to just appreciation, especially not just for the appreciation of a few rich people as decoration or embellishment. In the hands of a few literati, art has almost been regarded as the tip of the tower on the ivory tower, and has become a shackle that ordinary people cannot reach. But real art must be human, and it must be something with flesh and blood.

I admit that there are genius artists in the world, because a person may have a special talent. But I don't believe that there is art from heaven and human world except for the art created by nature itself. Because people's artistic requirements are just human's true, good, and beautiful emotional requirements. Artistic perceptions vary with each person's living conditions, but the point of being based on emotion to demand is exactly the same.

Some people ridicule the classics in the calligraphy and painting market recently because many nouveau riche want to be elegant. This may be part of the truth. But whether it is a nouveau riche or a family of scholars, loving calligraphy and painting cannot be considered a sin; the sin is a generation of so-called artists who are willing to sacrifice the public's artistic requirements for money.

For example, many people criticize the street comics for containing "feudal toxins," which is indeed true; like those "foreign paintings" such as Zhu Bajie recruiting relatives and Liangshanbo heroes, they can also be said to contain "toxins"; however, if our noble artists are only focused on drawing a few sparse ink groups or so-called new impressionists that make people more and more confused, then the "folk gallery" will probably only be occupied by things like Zhu Bajie recruiting relatives, and the comic book stalls on the streets and alleys will always become public libraries.

In the history of modern painting, many changes have taken place in terms of both technique and subject matter, especially in terms of technique. There have been countless changes in light and color alone, but as a result of over-emphasis on technique, the content of the paintings is becoming more and more distant from the public's artistic requirements. On the contrary, "foreign paintings" such as Sun Wukong making havoc in the Heavenly Palace and Zhu Bajie recruiting relatives have remained the same for decades, but they are still the only "wall decoration" for rural families to decorate the New Year. Rural people may only use these things as wallpaper, but in their eyes, they are more pleasing to the eye than those things full of oil paints and ink groups. As for whether there are "feudal toxins," how can you and I blame the rural people!

### The Shadow of Truth

— Shi Shi

Eating at a table for eight immortals, I faced the four long windows, only to see the shadow of the window reflected in a bowl of soup. As the soup moved, the shadow of the window flickered, which was very beautiful. I intended to ask my two younger brothers to appreciate it, but then I changed my mind. One was sitting on my left, and the other was sitting opposite me, just facing away from the long window. Neither of them would see the scene I had discovered.

The long windows were still those long windows, but because we had different positions and different viewpoints, the impressions we got were different. What I see now is not the true appearance of the long window, but only the shadow of the long window. The soup reflects the shadow; the flickering is the fluctuation of the water, but the long window stands there without flickering.

Understanding that it is due to different positions or different backgrounds, I did not force anyone to appreciate the flickering long window.

This is originally a common sense, not rare. However, there are so many people who have ignored this common sense throughout the ages. Ancient Confucian scholars and sages, occasionally feeling something, express it in writing, and naturally there is a supreme principle, but he only expresses his momentary experiences or feelings, and does not mean to ask others to always regard it as a golden rule. It is the later corrupt scholars who annotate in detail and judge it as an unchanging truth. There are even "scholars" who value sects and blindly believe that truth is only found in one family, and that others are heresies, attacking each other and creating many unnecessary disputes. Later people also participated in the sectarian disputes, fighting only for the sake of anger, and getting further and further away from the truth. If they could understand the positions or backgrounds of the ancient Confucian scholars and sages, they might understand their intentions more clearly and would not be so "persistent."

Scholars who study ancient books all day long are diligent and isolated from real life. After years of accumulation, they may suddenly dig something out of ancient books due to occasional inspiration. However, they issue it as a theory, believing it to be a truth, and insist that others appreciate it in the same way. We must not believe it so easily, it must not be the truth, but only the shadow of the truth. There are also some people who create new ideas with the sole purpose of attracting the attention of others in order to achieve their goal of selling their reputation. Then, what they call truth will naturally be greatly discounted.

Even if it is the truth, it must be seen under what conditions it is produced. The truth under certain conditions may be completely different in another position and viewpoint. For example, the axioms and formulas in Euclidean geometry are completely incomprehensible in non-Euclidean geometry.

I accidentally saw a passage of ancient text, which is the confession of a loyal minister who died for his country: "A wife's service to her husband is like a subject's service to the ruler. If a subject's wife does not betray the subject, how dare the subject betray the country!" It is really the tone of a complete slave. The so-called wife is a slave to her husband, and subjects are slaves to the emperor. Looking at it in this democratic era, one cannot help but denounce it as absurd. However, in the era when foot binding was prevalent, how many people had true knowledge and saw that foot binding was a crime? At that time, not a single loving mother did not choose to sit and watch her beloved daughter cry. What the predecessors thought was natural and insisted on fighting for is now nothing more than a joke. Do not say that "people's hearts are not as old as before" must be a bad phenomenon, the liberation of thought from all constraints is a great progress.

### "Generate Wealth for Me"

— Wang Kao

Going out during the New Year, you can probably see "Generate Wealth for Me" plastered all over the walls everywhere. Getting rich is of course a common requirement of Chinese people, and "Generate Wealth for Me" can especially represent the national character and lifestyle of China. Why? Although China boasts a lot about being "vast in territory and abundant in resources," if we count the amount of property owned by each farmer, before the war, it was only about 20 to 30 yuan on average. Converted into today's figures, even if multiplied by 200,000 times, it would only be 4 to 6 million yuan. Their clothes do not cover their bodies, their houses do not keep out the wind and rain, and they cannot even talk about nutrition when it comes to food. That is why some people say that China is only divided into big poverty and small poverty, and there is no difference between having property and not having property. It is precisely because of this that people generally have a strong desire to get rich. In fact, the so-called getting rich is nothing more than maintaining a life of basic needs. Mencius's utopia is just a house of five acres, planted with mulberry trees, so that people in their seventies can wear silk, and even chickens, pigs, dogs, and hogs can be raised at the right time, so that they can eat meat, etc., almost without mentioning any spiritual life. What is strange to us is that from Confucius, Mencius, Mozi, and Laozi to the present, it has been about 3,000 years, and this extremely limited "freedom from hunger" is still ethereal. Not only do we feel ashamed when we see foreigners, but it seems that we also have too great a responsibility to the former philosophers. Then, how can we easily criticize the idea of "getting rich"? However, there are really too many ways to get rich. Generally, there are only two ways. One is to get rich by benefiting both oneself and others, and the other is to get rich by harming others and benefiting oneself. Unfortunately, most of us Chinese have chosen the latter, which has only made the society, which has been stagnant for 3,000 years, sink even further. This is also a great tragedy.

"Generate Wealth for Me" is the general representative of harming others and benefiting oneself. The so-called for me is to benefit oneself, and it also has exclusivity, which is to harm others. Originally, the moral concepts of the whole world have been messed up to a very confusing point. What everyone respects is not morality itself, but money. The gates of lords and princes are filled with benevolence and righteousness. No wonder materialists say that ideology depends on the economic base. However, in other countries, there is always an unwritten law, that is, the acquisition of money must come from reputable work. Even if there are kidnappers in New York and Chicago, and there are often corruption cases in New York State, after all, the people of the whole country despise them and even hate them from the bottom of their hearts. Therefore, the country is not controlled by the harming-others-and-benefiting-oneself faction in the end, and most of the wealth is still in the hands of industrial families such as Ford, Carnegie, Rockefeller, and DuPont. It is absolutely not like our China, where getting promoted is a shortcut to getting rich, and breaking the law is the beginning of one's own career. Leaving that aside, as long as a person sits in a car and owns a foreign house, absolutely no one asks about the source of these properties. If it is discovered that his source is not proper, then public opinion will sanction him. I boldly analyze the psychology of Chinese people, which is probably like the fox saying that the grapes are sour because it cannot eat them. Maybe I cannot guarantee myself. When it really comes to the time of the test, whether I have that much determination. In the past, someone in Zeng Wenzhenggong's mansion wrote an eight-legged essay saying that he was not moved by beautiful women and red and blue hats. He even bragged about himself to the governor. A young man jokingly added a comment: "Beautiful women and red and blue hats are on the side, and he is not moved by either. He just wants to see the master!" This is impersonating a gentleman, and his motive is nothing more than that. If he completely puts his conscience under his arm, what else is there to say? Money has no symbol. Stolen goods and wages are no different in terms of banknotes. This is a major loss of modern civilization. What is related is how the collective moral concept of the nation is. Today, if you want to make a bookworm maintain his tightness and complete his purity and integrity, it is a dream. Even the most reliable person has 70% unreliability. Think about who is doing it, who is causing it? This cannot be said that the scholars are not competitive, the society has no fair and healthy moral standard, that is, the property standard, which is our daily great suffering. In the past, we could still say that we were Qing Gao, but now we must be clear, otherwise we will not be high. Without him, without money, we will naturally not be high. Social scientists often like to call modern culture capitalist culture. In fact, although the meaning of capitalism is inevitable to exploitation, it still has some benefits for mankind. For example, although we oppose Ford's accumulation of wealth, we cannot but agree with and use cars, which is very obvious. Only Chinese culture and popular thinking cannot be represented by capitalism, but can only be said to be theft, which is still very different from capitalism. What a pity!

### Fleeting Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 10: Voluntary Sacrifice (69)

Yu Ru was very embarrassed by this sentence, and just as he was about to explain, Qi Wan said again, "Old gentleman, I am a straightforward person. I say what's on my mind, regardless of whether people like to hear it or not, but if I say it, I can do it. I may have lost my composure under these intense stimuli today. Please forgive me!" Seeing that she spoke very firmly, Yu Ru knew that she must be very determined in her actions. He nodded and said, "Good, good, I believe you, and I sympathize with you very much. You have suffered too much injustice. Your spirit of sacrificing yourself for the benefit of others is extremely admirable!" Qi Wan said, "This is nothing. Since things have come to this point, this is how it should be done. But I have one thing to ask of you, old gentleman. I will not tell anyone what you said to me today, and I hope you won't reveal what I promised to Zhu either. Because as soon as he knows, his attitude will change again. At that time, I will be entangled by personal feelings, and may lose my reason and no longer have the courage to fulfill my promise. Old gentleman, take advantage of my clear mind now and leave. If I promise you, I must do it." As she spoke, she stood up and bowed to Yu Ru. Seeing Qi Wan enduring the pain in her heart, her resolute expression overflowing in her words, Yu Ru was very impressed. He nodded to Qi Wan and said, "I admire you, I respect you, and I sympathize with you very much. I hope you won't make yourself suffer too much. Even if you are forced by circumstances in the future and cannot fulfill your previous promise, I will forgive you." Qi Wan said, "Old gentleman, believe me, I am confident I can do it." As she spoke, she saw Yu Ru to the door. Yu Ru clasped his hands in a bow and said, "Take care of yourself." Qi Wan, with tears in her eyes, returned to the room, feeling extremely sad. She couldn't help but collapse on the bed and cry loudly. Little Wang's mother entered the room to comfort her. After Qi Wan cried for a while, venting the pent-up frustration in her chest, she saw that Little Wang's mother was still standing beside her, trying to console her. She said to her, "Don't tell Mr. Xu that Mr. Xu came to our house today." Little Wang's mother said, "What exactly is the matter, madam, that you are so sad?" Qi Wan said, "You don't need to ask. You will understand naturally later." Seeing that Qi Wan was full of sadness, Little Wang's mother didn't dare to say more, only saying, "Madam, don't be sad. Mr. Xu is a good person. Don't listen to other people's gossip." Qi Wan said, "I haven't listened to other people's gossip." As she spoke, she pursed her lips, frowned, and hesitated for a long time. Suddenly, she walked into the bedroom, dialed the telephone, and Little Wang's mother followed her. Seeing her pick up the receiver, she said a few simple words, as if arranging to meet someone, which was inexplicable. After Qi Wan made the phone call, she sat down in front of the dressing table and carefully touched up her makeup. Since her father's death, she had not worn makeup due to the mourning period. Today, she heavily relied on cosmetics, applying rouge and powder, drawing her eyebrows, and applying lipstick. Her scattered perm was then styled by Little Wang's mother. Then, she went to the dressing room, opened the wardrobe, picked out a very bright floral satin cheongsam, looked at herself in the mirror, and came out, saying to Little Wang's mother, "I have something to go out for, and I may not come home for dinner. When Mr. Xu comes, if he asks where I went, tell him you don't know."

### Records of Lost Sounds

— Copper

Mr. Vincent Edwards of New York has a passion for collecting gramophone records. He has already collected two thousand records of speeches by famous people. What is especially valuable is that most of the people who gave those speeches have passed away. Vincent Edwards has realized the ideal of Edison, the inventor of the gramophone record: "To preserve the voices and speeches of Lincoln and Washington for our next generation."

In his national voice academy, you can hear Florence Nightingale talk about her work as a nurse, or Robert Peary talk about how he discovered the North Pole. You can hear the voices of historical figures such as Queen Victoria, the French actress Bernhardt, the novelist Mark Twain, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the humorist Will Rogers, Emperor Joseph, the famous actress Barnum, the radio inventor Marconi, and the British Prime Minister Disraeli, among others.

The most moving record in Vincent Edwards' collection is the bugle call of the famous "Charge of the Light Brigade" (an American film company made a film called "The Charge of the Light Brigade"). It was recorded in London in 1890 by the bugler Landfrey, who was the only survivor of the Charge at that time, and he used the same bugle as on that fateful day to record it.

### On Everyone Eating Eggs

— Ze Shi

Some time ago, a conference was held in Shanghai. A representative gave a speech, and the newspapers only recorded two sentences of his speech: "We should not have everyone eat rice, but everyone should have rice to eat." (Something to that effect, I forgot the exact words.) At the time, I thought it was very strange: isn't everyone having rice to eat the same as everyone eating rice? Why is the former considered desirable and the latter undesirable? This question was not clear to me until yesterday when I overheard two tea drinkers chatting at a tea house.

Tea Drinker A: How is life in England?

Tea Drinker B: Very difficult. One person can only eat one egg a week.

Tea Drinker A: Oh my goodness!

Tea Drinker B: But everyone doesn't complain, because everyone only eats one egg.

Tea Drinker A: Why doesn't everyone complain if they only eat one egg?

Tea Drinker B: Because with four thousand million eggs to supply four thousand million people, everyone eats eggs, so what is there to complain about?

Tea Drinker A: It can be seen that people's hearts are truly bad. They are only happy when everyone eats the same small amount as them, and not happy when others eat more than them.

Tea Drinker B: It's not that people's hearts are bad, but that there are too few eggs. England has four thousand million people, but the English hens cannot produce four thousand million eggs every day or every hour. This week's four thousand million eggs are all obtained by the government. If Attlee has to eat seventeen eggs every week, Churchill has to eat twenty-eight eggs every week, and other civil and military officials, wealthy merchants, and magnates each have to eat three or four eggs every week, then some people won't even be able to eat half an egg every six months.

Tea Drinker A: Hmm. But I think it's better for everyone to have eggs to eat than for everyone to eat eggs.

Tea Drinker B: Why?

Tea Drinker A: Because the former is a bit domineering, while the latter is the way of benevolent rule.

Tea Drinker B: Explain in more detail.

Tea Drinker A: Eggs are nutritious and very beneficial to the body, so it is better to eat more. Everyone eating eggs is limited to the existing eggs, and the existing eggs are not originally one per person. Forcibly dividing them up and eating them, although it is equal, leads to scarcity and domineering behavior. Everyone having eggs to eat means that everyone competes to eat eggs. Even if some people eat thirty or forty eggs in an hour, and some people only eat one egg in thirty or forty hours, it is still more in line with the way of benevolent rule than one egg per person per week.

Tea Drinker B: What you say is not without reason. But the result of competing to eat eggs will certainly not be as good as you imagine. There will definitely be some people who get sick from eating too many eggs, and some people who get sick from not eating any eggs.

Tea Drinker A: That's their own fault. Who told them not to get eggs to eat.

Tea Drinker B: It's definitely not their own fault. There are only two ways to get eggs to eat: either raise chickens or steal them.

Tea Drinker A: You can also buy them.

Tea Drinker B: That's right, you can also buy them. But there are only so many eggs. If you, me, and him all rush to buy them, the price will definitely skyrocket, and people with no money will never have eggs to eat.

Tea Drinker A: Then raise chickens.

Tea Drinker B: Poor people generally don't have time to raise chickens. Rich people also don't like to raise chickens.

Tea Drinker A: Then there's no way.

Tea Drinker B: One egg per person is the way.

Tea Drinker A: But I still think it's better for everyone to have eggs to eat.

Tea Drinker B: I don't necessarily insist on everyone eating eggs, but sometimes there can only be everyone eating eggs. For example, after drinking tea, I want to take a piece of cake home. I have as many as six children. There is only one piece of cake, so I say that everyone eats the cake, divide it into six equal parts, and everyone gets one. If everyone has a cake to eat, I'm afraid I would have to buy three or four cakes to avoid the big ones snatching from the small ones, and the strong taking from the weak. But I only have enough money to buy one piece of cake.

I had to leave because I had something to do and didn't hear their conclusion, but I had already realized that the above-mentioned representative's "everyone eat rice" versus "everyone have rice to eat" is similar to the debate between Tea Drinker A and Tea Drinker B about "everyone eating eggs" versus "everyone have eggs to eat." However, I dare not make a judgment on which is right and which is wrong.

### People and Flowers

— Jiang Duxin

In the past, people liked to use various flower names to describe various women, and they also liked to use the idiom "flower-like face and moon-like appearance" to describe a woman's beauty. But two news items on page eight of the Shen Bao tell us in even more depth a fact that contrasts "people" and "flowers," and that is: "People are cheaper than flowers!"

Because the positions of these two news items are not next to each other, readers may find it difficult to compare them. Here, the author does not mind the trouble and specifically copies them below for readers to ponder for themselves!

(1) "Hefei, 7th Telegram: Citizen Zhang Chengren, due to financial difficulties and unable to get through the New Year, came up with a strange idea and posted an advertisement on the bulletin board next to the Anhui Daily office, roughly saying: 'Urgently need funds, specifically selling his young son, only collecting six million legal tender.'"

(2) "Guangzhou, 7th Telegram: As the Lunar New Year approaches, various flowers are on the market here. Peonies cost 15 million yuan per pot, and the highest price for a branch of plum blossoms is 20 million..."

After reading these two news items, I think readers cannot help but be moved, right?

### Random Thoughts

— Leng Leng

The world is a permanent dance stage, with all of humanity playing the role of actors. The entrance is the maternity hospital, and the exit is the funeral parlor.

There are no absolutely good or bad people in the world. So-called good people are those who have done more good deeds than bad deeds in their lives; conversely, bad people are those who have done more bad deeds than good deeds in their lives.

The spatial distances in the world are becoming closer due to scientific advances, but the spiritual distances between humans are becoming farther and farther.

### Lighter than a Feather

— Lei Hong

It is said that in the cradle days of airplanes, when they were still called airships, ordinary people did not dare to try them, because this new means of transportation was too dangerous. If they fell down, they would be smashed to pieces, just a death lighter than a feather. Therefore, at that time, the people who rode airplanes were all adventurers and scientists—those who had a special interest in the aircraft industry, embraced the humanitarianism of martyrs, and took it as their responsibility to improve its devices and equipment were the first heroes to soar into the clouds.

Airplanes have been improved to their current state of equipment, from the most rudimentary of hanging a basket under a lighter-than-air balloon to the fish-style rocket plane that scientists are still dreaming about today, in preparation for a long journey to the moon. In the process, I don't know how many precious lives have been sacrificed. Do you say that this kind of death is lighter than a feather? Actually, it is not. Precisely because life only happens once, aircraft manufacturers have to be cautious. Each accident is a painful experience. Relying on this painful experience has laid the foundation for today's flight safety equipment, which has not yet reached the ideal, but is already quite impressive. Of course, using airplanes to drop bombs and destroy countless lives at once is another matter altogether, a digression, so let's not talk about it for the time being.

Although there are many airplane accidents today, there are still people who ride them, because of the function of the airplane itself—its becoming an undeniable means of transportation. Therefore, we cannot close all air routes because of accidents, just as we cannot stop eating because of choking.

However, there is something that has no value in itself, and is enough to endanger life, and should actually be abolished, but the authorities have not stopped it, allowing irreplaceable lives to disappear as easily as feathers. How sad is that? What is this thing? It is the firecrackers that I have called for to be abolished in this column. Since the last article was published, one tragic event after another has been reported in the newspapers. Those who are concerned about social news should know, and I will not list them here. On the 5th of this month, two more tragedies occurred. One was a young man surnamed Lu living on Jingting Road, who was making money selling firecrackers. Due to the explosion of his stock, he was covered in injuries and died after being sent to the hospital. The other was a Mr. Chen from Pudong, who had imported a large quantity of firecrackers. He accidentally dropped them on the ground, and they exploded, severing his left foot on the spot, and also causing serious injuries to his head and hands.

People who sell firecrackers do it for a living, but the result is that they burn themselves to death, just like moths flying into a flame. This is a warning to today's fire players. And their death does not benefit the firecrackers themselves. It is truly lighter than a feather. We don't know why firecrackers should still exist! If it is because the United States welcomes them, and we can use them to earn foreign exchange, and therefore not prohibit their production, that is truly as absurd as "the moon is rounder in foreign countries!"

### Madman

— Fang Ji

A Russian was walking down the street when he suddenly said to himself, "Our government is full of rogues. Their only policy is to fool the people!"

A policeman immediately walked over and grabbed his clothes. The passerby's friend came to defend him, saying, "Don't grab him. He's a madman!"

The policeman said, "Hey! If he really is a madman, how could he know so much detail and accuracy?"
