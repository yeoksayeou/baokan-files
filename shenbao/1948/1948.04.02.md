### Promulgation of Revised National Assembly Organization Law: Presidium of 85 Members; Fourth Preparatory Meeting to Elect Today

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Order from the National Government: The revised Article 5 of the National Assembly Organization Law is hereby promulgated.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Regarding the proposal to revise Article 5 of the National Assembly Organization Law and expand the National Assembly Presidium's quota, the National Assembly Secretariat rushed the document to the National Government on the afternoon of the 31st. After the Chairman commented, "This Chairman proposes and immediately convenes a temporary State Council meeting to discuss it," the State Council convened a second temporary meeting on the morning of the 1st, presided over by Sun Ke, to discuss the matter. After discussion, it was decided to approve the principle and send it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The Legislative Yuan also held its eighth temporary meeting at 3:00 PM on the 1st and brought it up for discussion. As a result, one word was revised, increasing the number of National Assembly Presidium chairpersons from 25 to 85. During the discussion, the members all believed that the original draft was not drafted by the Legislative Yuan, and listing only 25 people was for fear of obstruction if there were too many people. Now, the opposite is true, so increasing the number of people will facilitate the handling of official business by various units' opinions and provide more political ability and training opportunities. The meeting's opinions also focused on the "mutual election" wording in Article 5 regarding the election method of the Presidium chairperson. The discussions on the number of candidates elected from each unit in the National Assembly preparatory meeting were not considered, and to avoid further disputes over the total number in the National Assembly preparatory meeting, delaying the session, the proposal to not specify the number of people was abandoned. Regarding the number of people, some advocated for 59 people, and some advocated for 99 people. As a result, Deng Hongye's proposal of 85 people received many endorsements, with 48 out of 63 people present voting in favor of its passage. The revised Article 5 of the National Assembly Organization Law reads as follows: The National Assembly shall establish a Presidium, which shall be composed of 85 members elected by the attending representatives. Its responsibilities are as follows: (1) Matters relating to the rules of procedure; (2) Matters relating to the administrative affairs of the National Assembly; (3) Other matters stipulated in this law. (Other discussion matters of the Legislative Yuan are published on page 2)

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The National Assembly is scheduled to hold its fourth preparatory meeting on the morning of the 2nd, still chaired by Chairman Yu Bin, to discuss the number of members and election methods of the Assembly Presidium based on the revised National Assembly Organization Law, and to immediately proceed with the election, so that the Assembly can be held as soon as possible.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] News from the National Assembly News Group: A total of 54 representatives registered at the National Assembly registration office on the morning of the 1st. The total number of registrations has now reached 2,164, and there are still 260 representatives en route, who will arrive in Beijing shortly.

### National Assembly Holds Third Preparatory Meeting Yesterday; Representatives' Seats Decided by Drawing Lots; Also Passes Resolution to Pay Attention to "Harmonious Atmosphere in the Venue"

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The National Assembly held its third preparatory meeting at 9:20 AM on the 1st, with 1,687 representatives in attendance, chaired by Chairman Yu Bin. Over the course of the morning, the method for determining the seating arrangement of representatives was revised and approved, and lots were drawn on the spot to determine the order of each unit. The order of the venue was better than the previous two days. More than 30 representatives took the stage to speak, mostly providing written opinions. Border ethnic minorities and overseas Chinese representatives were unanimously given preferential treatment, not participating in the drawing of lots, and were assigned to front-row positions. Elderly representatives with mobility issues and blind representatives were allowed to move to vacant seats of the Presidium chairpersons.

Hong Lanyou, the temporary secretary-general of the preparatory meeting, reported on the principles of the draft method for determining the seating arrangement of representatives drafted by the preparatory committee before the discussion. The general idea was to follow the established rules of the previous National Assembly, advocating for the use of a unit-based arrangement, so that representatives from each unit could easily concentrate on exchanging opinions. During the representatives' speeches, some advocated for following the order of registration, some advocated for adopting a mixed lottery, and some advocated for using both methods in a compromise. The chairman first put the unit system and the mixed system to a vote, and the result was the passage of drawing lots according to the unit system. Furthermore, the draft method stipulates that the order of representatives in each unit is "in the order of registration," which was revised to "determined by drawing lots" after a second vote. However, the five units of Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, border ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese will not participate in the unit lottery, and together with the Presidium, a total of six units will be placed in the front row, which was also agreed to by all representatives. Taiwan originally intended to be included in the border representatives due to language relations, but after the Taiwan representatives expressed that due to the smooth promotion of Mandarin, there were no major problems in terms of language, and they were willing to give up preferential treatment and participate in the lottery, which won applause from the entire venue.

A complete list of unit orders

The unit lottery was held publicly by the chairman and secretary-general after the break. A total of 55 units participated in the lottery, and the results are as follows: 1. Industrial Groups, 2. Jiangsu, 3. Guangdong, 4. Ningxia, 5. Liaoning, 6. Shandong, 7. Hankou, 8. Hunan, 9. Free Professional Groups, 10. Qingdao, 11. Suiyuan, 12. Shanxi, 13. Xing'an, 14. Beiping, 15. Andong, 16. National Women's Groups, 17. Agricultural Groups, 18. Guizhou, 19. Shaanxi, 20. Chongqing, 21. Taiwan, 22. Henan, 23. Qinghai, 24. Liaobei, 25. Commercial Groups, 26. Fujian, 27. Heilongjiang, 28. Jilin, 29. Chahar, 30. Hubei, 31. Sichuan, 32. Shanghai, 33. Xi'an, 34. Guangxi, 35. Dalian, 36. Inland Nationals with Special Living Habits, 37. Zhejiang, 38. Yunnan, 39. Hejiang, 40. Educational Groups, 41. Anhui, 42. Nanjing, 43. Harbin, 44. Fishing Groups, 45. Gansu, 46. Tianjin, 47. Shenyang, 48. Industrial and Mining Groups, 49. Rehe, 50. Hebei, 51. Guangzhou, 52. Jiangxi, 53. Xikang, 54. Songjiang, 55. Nenjiang. The lottery for representatives of each unit will be convened by each unit itself.

No Need to Reserve Seat Number One

During the representatives' speeches, some advocated reserving seat number one for Representative Chiang Kai-shek to show respect. Hong Lanyou then announced that Representative Chiang had not yet registered as of today, and Representative Chiang had stated after being elected that he did not wish to be elected. However, he has now received his certificate of election, and the Assembly has reserved a seat for the Chairman of the National Government on the podium, so there is no need to reserve seat number one for General Chiang. In addition, the meeting also passed temporary motions: (1) The secretariat will publicly announce that representatives can freely donate money to help the Xiaguan refugees. (2) Pay attention to the harmonious atmosphere of the venue. When representatives speak, all representatives should listen patiently and not boo. Yu Bin also, at the request of the representatives, gave a brief report on the signing representative's experience of sending representatives to comfort those on hunger strike yesterday. The meeting adjourned at 11:35 AM.

### Legislative Yuan Discusses the Issue of Signing Elected National Assembly Representatives; No Resolution Reached; Representatives on Hunger Strike for Five Days

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] During the eighth temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 1st, the issue of signing the names of elected National Assembly representatives was discussed once. Chen Xiaocen and others stated that the hunger strike of the ten representatives was a serious issue, and the resolution to cede to friendly parties was based on the principle of expanding the foundation of the government, but it should also be expanded to the public, and democratic public opinion should not be denied. If attention is paid to the foundation of the party while neglecting the foundation of the public, it would be inappropriate. Therefore, it was advocated to find ways to remedy the situation, so that the signing representatives can be legally elected, and to solve the problem by the Legislative Yuan suggesting that the National Government find a way to resolve it, so that they can be produced from national professional groups to attend the Assembly. Hong Ruizhao appealed to all parties to broaden their horizons, otherwise, if an accident occurs, history will not forgive the stain, leaving regret for eternity. Chen Guyuan and Lin Bin believed that the relevant legal parts must be carefully considered, because even if National Assembly representatives are produced from professional groups, they must have membership in the relevant professional groups and must be elected. It seems difficult to change this through legislative suggestions or executive orders. Zhou Shuyun and others firmly advocated that the Legislative Yuan should pay attention to the legal position and avoid making ineffective involvement in this political dispute, until it was decided to stop the discussion.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The issue of signing the names of elected National Assembly representatives remained unresolved on the 1st. At around 3:00 PM, Ma Wenche and Sheng Zizhuang visited Chen Lifu and discussed it for a long time, but no conclusion was reached. Mr. Chen promised to report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek after reporting to Hu Shi and others, and then discuss it again. The ten representatives continued their hunger strike on the 1st, which has now reached the fifth day, and their general health is becoming increasingly weak. The National Assembly has asked doctors from the Municipal Hospital to check on their health at any time and inject glucose solution for them. However, except for Yang Qiaoxin, who is old and weak, and Zhang Fu, who has a lung disease, who were persuaded by many people to accept the injection, the rest were unwilling to receive the injection. In addition, Su Mingfang and Yang Shilin, two representatives on hunger strike, have received their certificates of election and went to the National Assembly to register on the 1st, but are still on hunger strike. The signing representatives gathered again on the evening of the 1st, and some advocated asking those on hunger strike to resume eating for three days to wait for the government to resolve the issue, but some opposed it and it was not passed. In the afternoon of the 31st, reporters visited all ten representatives on hunger strike, and they all stated that they were determined to persevere to the end and were unwilling to resume eating until a solution was reached. Throughout the day on the 31st, representatives went to their residences to express their sympathy. President Ju Zheng also personally went to express his sympathy at 4:00 PM on the 31st. The National Assembly also sent representatives Yu Bin, Wu Yun, Hu Dingan, Ding Jiwan, Xu Zinan, and Chen Cunren, accompanied by Hong Lanyou, to express their sympathy. Yu Bin and others advised the ten representatives to prioritize their health and accept a compromise, and to attend the meeting first, but it was not accepted.

### First National Assembly Representatives Organize Associations Separately

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The National Assembly representatives from the six national free professional groups of news reporters, lawyers, engineers, accountants, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and physicians had a lunch gathering after the adjournment of the Assembly at noon on the 2nd. At the same time, they held a meeting and publicly elected Feng Youzhen as chairman. The resolutions were: (1) The Free Professional National Assembly Representatives Association will be established today; (2) The Assembly seating order of each unit will be drawn; (3) Liaison officers will be elected from each unit, including (news reporters) Zhao Junhao, Feng Youzhen, Liu Weifeng; (lawyers) Zhang Qieping, Wang Shanxiang, Yu Chunhua; (engineers) Gu Yujing, Xia Guangyu; (accountants) Cai Jinying, He Yuanming; (traditional Chinese medicine practitioners) Lai Shaohun, Ding Jiwan; (physicians) Hua Shujun, Fan Shouyuan.

### Differing Opinions on Foreign Aid; U.S. Senate and House Begin to Confer; House of Representatives Passes Aid to China Bill

[This Newspaper] New York, 1st, Radio, Washington: The Senate and House of Representatives began conferring on the foreign aid plan on the 1st to seek to adjust differing opinions.

[This Newspaper] New York, 1st, Radio, Washington: Congressman Chow Yide expressed his opinion on the 1st, advocating that the government select "first-class figures" to implement the aid to China plan. He said: Congress has fulfilled its responsibility in this regard, and the future of the aid to China work will depend on the efforts of the government. Mr. Chow believes that those who implement the plan must understand that in terms of aid to China, military and economic aspects are complementary. Wedemeyer would be an ideal candidate, but in view of the importance of his current mission, he may not be able to take the position.

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 31st] Tonight, the House of Representatives formally passed the Unified Foreign Aid Act of $6.205 billion, including $570 million in aid to China ($150 million for the military part and $420 million for the economic part). The vote was 329 to 74.

The House of Representatives loudly rejected the motion to return the entire bill to the Foreign Affairs Committee at the last minute, and rejected a substitute amendment by a vote of 207 to 6. The amendment proposed placing the entire plan under the United Nations. Attempts to remove China, Greece, and Turkey from the bill were also rejected.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st] After the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Foreign Aid Act with an overwhelming majority tonight, it immediately designated three Republican congressmen and two Democratic congressmen to participate in a joint committee of the two houses to discuss the differences between the House and Senate foreign aid bills with an equal number of senators from March 1. Vandenberg said yesterday that he hoped the joint committee of the two houses would be able to submit a compromise plan in time for Congress to give it final approval this weekend. The bill passed by the House of Representatives stipulates: (1) A four-year European Recovery Program totaling $5.3 billion. (2) $420 million in economic aid to China and $150 million in military aid to China for a period of 15 months, until the end of June next year. (3) $275 million in military aid to Greece and Turkey for a period of one year. (4) $60 million for the International Children's Emergency Relief Fund. The bill also stipulates the establishment of a "China Construction Mixed Committee," which will include two American committee members appointed by the U.S. President and three Chinese committee members appointed by the Chairman of the Chinese National Government.

### National Assembly Chronicle: Scrambling to Argue About Seating

Special Report from This Newspaper (Nanjing, April 1st)

Democratic politics is about respecting dissent, seeking common ground, and the expression of public opinion is precisely valuable because there are differences. The preparatory meetings of the National Assembly for the past three days have been full of contention, shouting, and even chaos, which shows that it represents public opinion and also proves that it is indeed a democratic institution. Therefore, until now, I am afraid that except for the election of Chairman Chiang as President, which will not be disputed, any resolution will inevitably involve debate and quarrels. In the preparatory meetings of the previous two days, there was a dispute for two days over the number of members of the Assembly Presidium, making an article of counter-proposal to the Legislative Yuan. On the morning of the 1st, there was also a heated debate over the method of determining the seating arrangement. In the huge Assembly Hall, reporters and constituent representatives saw Mei Lanfang's play two years ago. If you sit in the upstairs or downstairs back row, you can't see or hear clearly. Who wouldn't want to sit in the downstairs front row? The seats in the National Assembly Hall are not sold for tickets, and there is no difference in ticket prices, but for the necessity of deliberation, you have to sit according to the seat number, and everyone wants to sit in a better position, so it is inevitable to scramble for a seat. The secretariat of the preparatory committee also anticipated this point, and followed the practice of the Constituent National Assembly to entrust the solution of this problem to fate or opportunity. According to Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, this method of arranging seats in Taiyuan City has precedents, and there will be no special problems. Temporary Chairman Yu Bin, who escaped the previous day, also thought it would be passed quietly and calmly took the stage. Although Secretary-General Hong's golden voice is a bit hoarse, the sound waves of his speech and the coherence of his narration are still clear. After he reported on the draft of the method for determining the seating arrangement of representatives, the representatives began to express their opinions. So opinions were raised and lowered, more and more opinions, and the order became more and more chaotic. Fortunately, Yu Bin's voice was loud and his handling was effective. With the assistance of Hong Lanyou, he sorted out the clues from the chaos, one by one clearly, and a one-third resolution was only made on the mornings of the 30th and 31st, while a complete case was passed on the morning of the 1st, and the efficiency of the National Assembly's deliberations has also increased. The first speaker was Deng Zhunamu, a Tibetan female representative from Xikang. She said that they should sit in a mixed order according to the order of registration, because it is not easy for everyone to meet. In this way, they can get to know more people, communicate understanding between compatriots in various places, especially with border compatriots, and increase unity, so they are not afraid of the instigation of ambitious people. If this is not possible, it is not easy for border compatriots to come to Beijing, and they do not understand the language, so they should sit in the front. Originally, Representative Deng's registration order was number four, and she was a Tibetan, so whether it was backwards or forwards, she had to find a way to sit in the front. Another opinion was to agree to draw lots by unit to determine the seating arrangement, but the seat order of individual representatives in each unit should not follow the registration order, but should also draw lots to be fair. Otherwise, everyone will have to rush to register before the meeting in the future, how can this be allowed? This opinion was raised by Representative Rui Jin from Taiyuan City, registration order number 1256. He registered late, so he had to have the opportunity to rush to the front. The third opinion was proposed by Representative Liu Cui, number 496, to draw lots by individual representative to determine the seating arrangement of the entire venue. He said that representatives from each unit can contact and communicate outside the venue, but they should not be separated into their own worlds in the venue, with clear divisions. He completely advocated a big mix. In addition to these three main opinions, some people also advocated equal opportunities, rotating straight and horizontal rows. Naturally, these opinions also had opposing opinions. Yu Bin then declared: "To summarize everyone's opinions, the main ones are the unit system and the mixed system. The mixed system is very good. This National Assembly is not only about building the Republic of China, but also about meeting the goal of advancing towards a great community." He announced with a smile that he would vote on the amendments first according to the law. Representatives who favored the mixed system pressed the button, and colorful stars appeared everywhere on the voting machine, but the number of representatives present was 1933, and the number of those who favored it was 806, a minority, and the mixed system opinion was rejected.

Discuss the original draft one by one, Article 1 and Article 2 were passed without objection, but Article 3 encountered a storm again. Tibetan, Mongolian, and border compatriots and overseas Chinese wanted to fight for the old rights to sit in the front, and some people thought of respecting Chairman Chiang and caring for elderly and disabled representatives, while others cared about the Mandarin of the Taiwan representatives, and positions should also be reserved for them in the front. Amidst the diverse opinions, one representative shouted: "The Communist bandits in North China and Northeast China are making such a fuss, what have we resolved in three days of meetings? Border representatives and overseas Chinese representatives are also Chinese, what reason is there to be special? We must treat everyone equally and vote to pass the original draft!" In a chorus of boos, under the arm-waving opposition of the Xinjiang representative who understood Mandarin, the chairman repeatedly shouted "Stop speaking, stop speaking."

So, the meeting passed Rui Jin's proposal to amend Article 3, Section 3 by a majority of 1121 votes, and then passed Article 4 without objection, before turning back to continue to defeat these problems of wanting to sit in the front one by one. Chairman Chiang has a position on the stage, and elderly and disabled representatives can sit in the vacant positions of the rotating chairmen on the stage. The Tibetan, Mongolian, and border compatriots and overseas Chinese sit in the front on both sides, while the Taiwan representatives admitted that there was no problem with Mandarin and did not want to rush to the front, thanking everyone for their concern. Then Yu Bin said: "The unit lottery will be held on the spot, let me and Secretary-General Hong perform a duet!" Yu Bin sang the province names, and Hong Lanyou sang the numbers. As a result of the drawing of lots, those in the front applauded, and those in the back smiled silently, scrambling to be first, doing their best, and listening to fate.

### National Assembly Voting Machine to be Officially Tested

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Assembly Hall is the only place in the country equipped with a voting machine. It was used during the previous Constitutional National Assembly. The current National Assembly has already held three preparatory meetings, and some representatives have expressed doubts about this machine. On the 1st, a representative even requested an inspection. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou responded tactfully, saying that any representative who wishes to see the voting machine is welcome to visit at any time, half an hour before the daily meeting. A formal test will be held on the day of the assembly to dispel any doubts.

### Editorial: The Issue of Issuing Short-Term Treasury Bills

Regarding the issue of issuing short-term treasury bills, opinions vary greatly; some strongly advocate for it, while others express deep skepticism. We believe that the answer to this question should be based on the purpose of issuing the treasury bills.

Generally speaking, the issuance of short-term treasury bills serves two main purposes: one is financial, where the treasury occasionally feels short due to seasonal factors, and issues these short-term bonds to make adjustments. Hence the name "treasury bills," and they are redeemed once the treasury's income is more abundant. The other is monetary, where treasury bills are issued judiciously to regulate the market when there is an overabundance of money and too much capital. The difference between them and government bonds is that the former are temporary, while the latter are relatively long-term. Compared to banknotes, the difference lies in the redemption period, with one having interest and a discount, and the other having neither. Therefore, from a purely financial point of view, issuing more banknotes is more advantageous.

Now, with the currency inflated too much, it is inconvenient to issue more banknotes. Instead, short-term treasury bills are issued and used as a means to recover a portion of the banknotes. This inevitably increases the burden on the treasury, but the intention is certainly justifiable. Those who support this policy are focusing on this point. There is indeed too much floating capital in the market right now. Phenomena such as soaring prices, rampant speculation, and the hardship of the people's livelihood and economic decline are all rooted in this. Yet there are no other practical countermeasures to absorb floating capital and tighten credit. Therefore, we naturally hope that the issuance of short-term treasury bills will proceed smoothly and achieve the expected effect.

However, issuing treasury bills is one thing, and whether they can absorb floating capital and achieve the expected effect is another. Although treasury bills and legal tender are different in form and nature, they are both freely circulating capital. Moreover, their unit is particularly large and the turnover is very fast. If the financial aspect is too strong and the issuance technique is slightly careless, they could very likely transform into a huge amount of legal tender, which will increase the amount of floating capital instead.

The regulations for the issuance of these treasury bills have not yet been announced. The amount of issuance and discount rate have no fixed rules. Everything is entrusted to the Central Bank to handle at its discretion in the open market, according to actual needs. We hope that the Central Bank will carefully consider and handle the public issuance prudently, so as to achieve the point of absorbing a part of the floating capital; even if we take a step back, we must not issue too much, which will increase the floating capital and deepen the malignant nature of currency inflation.

Now the market interest rate is as high as 30-40%, and in order to ensure the smooth issuance of treasury bills, we have to increase the discount to arouse the interest of the general public. Therefore, when the first batch of treasury bills matures, we have to issue more than the first batch to cope with it. In this case, more and more treasury bills will be issued, floating capital will increase day by day, and the national treasury's burden will also continue to increase. Many people are worried that the future results may not be good. The reason is on the left. For the sake of the credit of treasury bills, we would like to put forward a few suggestions: First, when the first batch of treasury bills expires, it should not be completely dependent on the reissuance of new treasury bills, at least a part of it must be supplemented by other financial resources; second, the amount of issuance should not be too large, nor should it be issued too quickly. It must be determined according to actual needs. In addition, there is one more point that seems worth mentioning, that is, the issuance of treasury bills is entrusted to the Central Bank for public handling, so it will not repeat the past mistakes of arbitrary allocation, but the old practice of bundling issuance must also be avoided as much as possible to refresh the ears and eyes of the general public. The minimum amount of this treasury bill is set at 10 million yuan. Because the amount is too large, it is not suitable for the distribution of all salaries. What is worrying is that the amount of various loans is huge and the need is particularly urgent. In the past, there were often cases where there was too little capital and it was too slow to solve the urgent need. We believe that other methods should still be found for these needs, and treasury bills should not be used to offset them, which would lose their original meaning.

In short, when issuing treasury bills, we should first recognize the goal clearly, and then identify the goal. If the goal is to absorb floating capital, then we should take this as the goal from beginning to end, and not make mistakes or get lost. Under this circumstance, all Chinese people should support the issuance of short-term treasury bills.

### Legislative Yuan Temporary Meeting Discusses the Draft Treasury Bill Regulations, Finally Decides to Re-Submit for Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Legislative Yuan held a temporary meeting on the 1st to discuss the draft "Regulations on Short-Term Treasury Bills of the Republic of China in the Thirty-Seventh Year." The draft was prepared by the Central Bank, which accepted the Four Banks Joint Secretariat's loan policy proposal for the 37th year and entrusted the bank to issue treasury notes in accordance with the market interest rate. It was sent to the Ministry of Finance on March 3, forwarded to the Executive Yuan on the 24th, approved, presented to the National Government on the 25th, and passed by the State Council on the 26th, and handed over to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. After being reviewed and revised by the Finance Committee on the 1st, it was submitted to the temporary meeting in the afternoon of the same day. The main points of the draft regulations are: the government authorizes the Central Bank to issue three types of short-term treasury bills with a duration of one month, two months, and three months. The face values are 10 million yuan, 50 million yuan, 100 million yuan, 500 million yuan, and 1 billion yuan. All are bearer bonds, with a monthly interest rate of 5%, and the principal and interest are paid together upon maturity. The amount of issuance is based on the actual sales amount and is not limited. The Central Bank may also increase or discount the issuance or repurchase the bonds early depending on the supply and demand of funds in the market. After Chen Changwu explained the review and modification process of this draft, Sun Jiulu, Liu Tong, Chen Zifeng, Hong Ruizhao and others spoke out in opposition, all of whom believed that the goal set by the first article of the draft, to "stabilize finance, absorb floating capital, and stabilize currency value" through this type of treasury bills, was too high. Sun Jiulu also cited the example of American treasury bills and government bonds, believing that the legal profit was far less than the unofficial interest rate. If the credit of legal tender cannot be maintained, the result will be fruitless. Hong Ruizhao pointed out that the effect of treasury bills is doubtful, but making the issuance of treasury bills become a competition between the government and merchants to speculate, insulting the political atmosphere, and causing disadvantages due to the uncertainty of appreciation and depreciation, is easy. Finally, it was decided to re-submit for review.

### Female Magistrate Xu Fangyuan Initially Shows Her Talent in Xifeng

— Special Correspondent Liu Mengchi

[Our Newspaper Guiyang March 28th Airmail] On the eve of the National Assembly meeting, the Guizhou Provincial Government, following the instructions of the highest authorities and based on local public opinion, is making every effort to open up the government, not only allowing the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party to conduct open activities in Guizhou, the sacred ground of the Kuomintang, but also selecting outstanding women with extraordinary talents to participate in the government, in order to meet the actual requirements of democratic politics. The appointment of Ms. Xu Fangyuan as the acting magistrate of Xifeng County, a transportation hub and scenic area of the province, at the provincial government meeting on the 27th of this month, is the best news that touches people's hearts.

Not Yet 30 Years Old, Elegant Demeanor

Ms. Xu is not unknown to the people, regardless of gender or age. She is less than 30 years old, has an elegant demeanor, is refined and courteous. She graduated from the Provincial No. 1 Women's Normal School and the Department of Education of Jinling Women's University. She is also an alumna of the Chinese Teachers' Association of Central University. She has served as a lecturer at Guiyang Provincial No. 1 Women's Normal School, a teacher at a girls' middle school, and was transferred from the Guizhou Provincial Government Directly Under the District to work. Of course, like ordinary women who enjoy sports, she has been calling on women to participate in social activities since her middle school days. Later, she gradually rose in rank and served as a member and executive director of the Provincial Women's Movement Committee, the chief executive of the Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, a member of the Guiyang City Provisional Council, a standing supervisor of the Guiyang City Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and a supervisor of the Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters. She also co-founded the "Great Wind Monthly" with her Jinling Women's University classmate Zhu Jianfen. She is currently the chairman of the Guiyang City Women's Association, a senator of the Guiyang City Council, and a director of the Guizhou Provincial Women's Association. After marriage, she became the wife of Sun Botao, the deputy general manager of the Guizhou Provincial Bank.

Confident and Articulating Aspirations

On the 26th, when her appointment as magistrate was announced, reporters searched everywhere for her to conduct an interview. Being the most active woman in Guiyang City, it was truly difficult to track her down. Finally, the hospitable reporter met her at a friend's place and asked her what political plans she had for managing Xifeng. She responded with a concise and capable attitude, saying that she had long been prepared for this task. She told me that she would definitely emphasize autonomous governance, especially in the past three or four years, she had been engaged in mass movement work and had gained experience and insights into local self-government. This time, the provincial government had recognized her past performance and her previous insights into local governance when they promoted her to this position. She would conduct a thorough investigation and research and regarded this task as an opportunity to serve the public. She did not have any special views, but she would follow the Three Principles of the People and Chairman Chiang's Five-Year Plan for New Guizhou as her guide for governing. She hoped to be able to mobilize the power of the people and strive for construction and progress in the rare stable environment, so that the Guizhou women who served as magistrates would not start with her and then have no successors.

Hard Work and Struggle for Five or Six Years

This female magistrate's ambition is indeed not small, which stems from her political foresight. Because to mobilize women, one must understand the psychology of the masses, be able to manipulate the arena, and be good at competitive elections. Ms. Xu has been diligently practicing these skills for the past five or six years. The women's movement in Guizhou Province, especially in Guiyang City, is led by Ms. Xu and her sister, and the City Women's Association they lead, along with the Provincial Women's Association led by Chen, have the strength to rival each other. Magistrate Xu has been engaged in women's elections for many years, and she is able to work hard and practically. Her brother-in-law is also in charge of national education, which provides her with considerable assistance.

Competing for Legislative Seats, Retreating as a Strategy

Six months ago, Magistrate Xu was campaigning for a Kuomintang nomination for a Legislative Yuan seat, but she could not overcome her political opponents. For a moment, she felt disheartened and suddenly published a statement of resignation in the Guizhou Daily, which surprised many political figures. This move, which she thought was clever, did not win her the nomination. At that time, she was very angry and uneasy. When the central government announced the list of legislative candidates, Magistrate Xu's name was not on the list. So she repeatedly gathered individuals with the same fate, plus three to five hundred women, to petition the Provincial Council, the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the Provincial Election Office, in order to avoid losing all her years of effort. In the end, due to legal restrictions, her wishes were not fulfilled. When it came to the legislative elections, Ms. Xu clearly distinguished between gratitude and resentment. With a determined heart, she simply gave the vast majority of votes she had already secured to Ms. Yang Yiru, a women's legislative candidate from the Democratic Socialist Party, determined to make those who wanted to control the votes end up with nothing. Political struggles are devoid of emotion, but women are ultimately fragile and inevitably susceptible to emotional impulses. On the day of the legislative elections, the Guiyang City press wanted to see the good show of the ladies competing for votes, and they absolutely did not let go of Ms. Xu's polling station. That day, moved by the scene, the vote she cast was the three large characters: "Yang Yiru."

Seizing Opportunities and Displaying Ambitions

This is not surprising. After the fact, the more she thought about it, the more unwilling she became. She thought of the "Official Cannon" in Chengdu, who could repeatedly accuse the mayor and thus become famous throughout the country. Since she had suffered such a great injustice, why not take the example of the official and do the same? Ms. Xu filed a complaint with the High Court against the Provincial Election Office for violating the law, causing the Provincial Election Office to work day and night to rush out a reply document, busily without stopping.

Ms. Xu is physically strong and full of energy. Participating in practical politics this time is exactly the excellent opportunity she should seize. Xifeng is a scenic area, only 73 kilometers from Guiyang City. Let's wait and see how she goes there to display all her ambitions.

### Case of Bullying Elderly Nun in Lanzhou: Senator Wang Zhongying Becomes Target of Public Anger; Professional Groups to Cast Recall Votes According to Law

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou 31st Dispatch] Lanzhou City Councilor Wang Zhongying, representing independent professional groups, was accused of bullying a vulnerable elderly nun last year and openly obstructing freedom of the press, leading to dissatisfaction among members of various independent professional groups, who jointly requested his recall. Since the law on recalling city councilors had not yet been promulgated, a request was submitted to the Ministry of Interior for instructions. It is now learned that the Ministry of Interior has sent a reply telegram stating: "Before the implementation measures for the recall of city councilors are promulgated by the Executive Yuan, in addition to submitting a petition for recall signed by one-twentieth of the voters in the electoral district or one-tenth or more of the members of the original group, a referendum should also be held. The recall shall be considered passed if more than half of the total votes cast are in favor. As for the voting method, the anonymous voting method shall be used." Lanzhou reporters and the Chinese and Western Medical Association will cast recall votes according to legal procedures after receiving the order.

### Full Text of Cable from Shanghai to the U.S. Congress

[Our Newspaper Report] In late March, Shanghai City Council Speaker Pan, concerned about the serious situation, repeatedly invited leaders from all walks of life to gather and discuss. As a result, in addition to mobilizing influential people in society to make suggestions to the government to reform various facilities, he also sent a cable to the U.S. Congress, respectfully requesting continued advocacy for aid to China to quell the Communist bandit rebellion. This cable was published in local English newspapers yesterday. The full text is as follows:

To the Honorable Vandenberg, Speaker of the Senate, Barkley, Democratic Leader, Martin, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Honorable Rayburn, Democratic Leader, Eaton, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and all members of the Congress:

We are deeply grateful to President Truman and to you all for your warm sympathy for our country as demonstrated by the $570,000,000 aid-to-China bill proposed by President Truman on February 18, which provides that a portion of the funds specified in the original bill should be allocated for military assistance, as resolved by the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress. Now that your Senate and House of Representatives are about to begin discussing the bill, we, representing the popular representative bodies, universities, rural areas, cultural, commercial, economic, and financial organizations of our country, feel compelled to state to you:

The rebellion of the Chinese Communists has its powerful international background. It is not merely an internal problem of our country, but a part of the world problem, namely the struggle between totalitarianism and democracy. Therefore, our two countries, China and the United States, are now fighting for a common mission, namely the peace and security of the world. Now the Communists are rampant in the Northeast and North China, and the economic situation in the enemy-occupied areas is also deteriorating. The situation has reached a critical point. Any assistance, if it is too small or too late, will not help the overall plan. We urgently request your attention: The seriousness of the situation in our country is no less than that in Europe, and the urgency of aid to China is also no less than that of aid to Europe. Therefore, we deeply hope that your Congress will pass the aid-to-China bill in the fastest possible way, and expand its scope and amount, so that all aspects of military, financial, and economic affairs can be taken care of. We will also fulfill our duties and jointly urge the government with the people of the whole country to implement reforms in politics, military affairs, finance, and economy in order to meet the requirements of our people, so that the good intentions and money of your people will not be wasted.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 1st Dispatch] Chen Tong, a major military traitor in northern Jiangsu, was a native of Siyang, Jiangsu. In the early stage of the War of Resistance, he served as the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the Independent Regiment of the 89th Army of the National Army.

### Soviet Union Suddenly Implements Strict Controls; Traffic Between East and West Berlin Blocked; British, American, and French Occupation Authorities Lodge Serious Protests

[Reuters Berlin 1st Dispatch] A British military train, under the protection of a guard ordered to forcibly prevent anyone from boarding, left Berlin hours before the Soviet Union suddenly announced the implementation of stricter restrictions on traffic across the East-West border. Britain had previously declared its refusal of the Soviet authorities' new restrictions, followed by France, and the United States announced that it would make the same representation. The new measures promulgated by the Soviet authorities were notified to the three Western occupying powers 24 hours earlier, stipulating that all persons, whether military or civilian, entering the Western sector from the Soviet sector must hold a transit passport, and all cargo must first be inspected by the Soviets at the border of the sector outside Berlin City. The Soviet notification of tightened border controls was delivered to the three Western occupying powers on the night of the 31st by Soviet Deputy Military Governor-General Lieutenant General Tratvenov. Previously, the British authorities had asked the Soviet authorities to postpone the implementation of the new measures for 15 days so that the three Western authorities could discuss the matter with Soviet representatives. After the Soviet authorities notified their decision to implement the measures as scheduled, Lieutenant General Browne, Chief of Staff of the British Military Headquarters, sent a letter to the Soviet side, stating that Britain refused to allow Soviet personnel to inspect cargo and Allied personnel to have transit passports. Major General Noiret, Deputy Military Governor of the French Military Government, also sent a letter to Lieutenant General Tratvenov, rejecting the Soviet Union's new border control measures, and declaring that these measures must be decided on a four-power basis. According to the German Post, which is registered with the French authorities in Berlin, the residents of several small villages on both sides of the highway near Materberg, the land traffic channel connecting Berlin to the Western occupied areas, have been ordered to move by the Soviet authorities, indicating that the Soviet military authorities are preparing to build barracks for border troops and German border guards to strengthen border control.

[United Press Berlin 1st Dispatch] The Soviet Union cut off land contact between Western countries and Berlin on the 1st. At the same time, Moscow Radio announced that the disintegration of Germany was a "fait accompli."

"Pravda" claimed that the British and Americans may protest the isolation of Berlin through the Allied Control Council, which "in fact is no longer the supreme body for the four-power joint administration of Germany." The Soviets insisted that they had the right to inspect vehicles heading to the British, American, and French sectors of Berlin, and cut off traffic from Berlin to the west.

[Reuters Berlin 1st Dispatch] Political figures in Berlin believe that the Soviet Union's tightening of traffic controls is likely the first step for the Soviet Union to force the Allies to withdraw from Berlin. People close to the Soviet military government also said that the Soviet Union is determined to implement these new measures to the end, and they have also drafted plans to deal with the situation caused by the Western countries' refusal to comply.

### British and American Military Vehicles Blocked; U.S. Switches to Air Transport

[Reuters Berlin 1st Dispatch] The U.S. Military Government in Berlin announced on the morning of the 1st that it has cancelled military trains in and out of Berlin and switched to air transport. Special air services will be added from Frankfurt in the U.S. occupied zone to the Tempelhof Airport controlled by the U.S. military in Berlin. After the Soviet-announced restrictions on transit came into effect at midnight on the 31st, the first U.S. military train leaving Berlin was detained at the Marienfelde station for 30 minutes for inspection by Soviet personnel before continuing westward. Later, a U.S. military train from Bremerhaven to Berlin and a U.S. military express train from Frankfurt to Berlin were blocked and returned because the U.S. military officers accompanying the train refused to allow Soviet personnel to board for inspection. Two British military trains detained by the Soviet Union at the Marienfelde station have not yet been heard from. The British military trains were detained because the British officers in charge accompanying the train, according to instructions from their superiors, did not allow Soviet personnel to board for inspection. The British military government has lodged a protest with the Soviet authorities regarding this matter. The U.S. and France are expected to lodge similar protests with the Soviet Union.

[Reuters Berlin 1st Dispatch] According to the German News Agency, refugees from Brunswick said that the number of Soviet border guards at the border between the British and Soviet occupied zones has greatly increased in recent days. They also said that, except for some fixed points in time, the border will soon be closed, and those who cross the border illegally will be killed.

### Soviet-Finnish Treaty Negotiations Stalled

[Reuters Helsinki 1st Dispatch] It is learned that the Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty negotiations have stalled due to Finland's insistence that the Soviet Union may not provide military assistance to Finland unless specifically requested by Finland.

### Draper Report to Be Released in U.S.

Most Employees of Japanese Government Agencies Have Resumed Work.

[Central News Agency Tokyo 1st Dispatch] Johnston, chairman of the Draper Mission, pointed out at a banquet of the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Tokyo today that Japan has been completely disarmed in terms of materials, its shipping has been completely destroyed, and its industry is also incomplete, so it cannot prepare for war for at least fifty years. The recommendations or reports of the representatives will be submitted to the US government first. He admitted that the delegation had no "magic formula," but that the members of the delegation were all experienced senior business people and had conducted two weeks of careful research in Japan. Draper said that the lack of a basis for concluding a peace treaty between Japan and Germany is one of the basic reasons hindering the country's economic recovery.

[Central News Agency Tokyo 1st Dispatch] Although Marquis, the head of the Economic and Scientific Section of the Allied Headquarters, issued an order yesterday prohibiting all organized regional strikes in Japan, sporadic strikers continued to strike today. Government telecommunications workers are still on strike in four prefectures and parts of other regions, but most employees of government agencies have now resumed work.

### Spain's Participation in the Reconstruction Plan: No Mention in US Congressional Committees, Everything Awaits Western European Nations' Own Decision

[Our Newspaper's Report] New York One-Day Broadcast: Washington News, the Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives decided not to mention Spain's participation in the European Recovery Program (ERP), leaving it entirely to the sixteen European countries to decide on their own.

[Our Newspaper's Report] New York One-Day Broadcast: Washington News, White House Press Secretary Ross declared that President Truman deeply opposed the House's passage of the section "Welcoming Spain's Participation in the European Recovery Program," believing that it would certainly be removed during the Senate and House's adjustment of the foreign aid bill.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, One-Day Dispatch] Before the US House of Representatives passed the amendment to the foreign aid bill, Democratic Congressman Douglas requested a re-vote on Congressman O'Konski's amendment to include Spain in the European Recovery Program. The result of the vote was that the motion passed again with a majority of 188 votes to 104.

[Reuters, Bogotá, 31st Dispatch] This agency has learned from authoritative sources that Secretary of State Marshall has instructed the State Department to use various methods to prevent Spain from being included in the House of Representatives' American aid to Europe plan. Marshall is most concerned about the impact on the Italian people if Spain, labeled as a fascist country, is included in the aid to Europe. It is reported that Marshall is maintaining contact with Acting Secretary of State Lovett in Washington, DC, and it is expected that the State Department will soon formally announce Marshall's views on this matter, and if necessary, Marshall himself will issue a statement here to counter the communist propaganda that uses the Spanish issue as an excuse.

### Myron Taylor Visits Spain

Will Discuss Political Issues with Franco

[Reuters, Madrid, One-Day Dispatch] President Truman's special envoy to the Vatican, Myron Taylor, visited General Franco on the 1st.

### France Suggests to the News Conference: Establish an International Press Council, The First Committee Concludes General Debate

[Associated Press, Geneva, One-Day Dispatch] French Chief Delegate Tourneau proposed today at the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information to establish an International Press Council to find ways to eliminate the publication of false news in newspapers, and to issue press cards to reporters and editors from various countries. The US representative hinted at opposition to this proposal. The French proposal seems to seek a compromise between the US and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union focuses on punishing false and distorted reports that endanger peace, while the US and Britain oppose any restrictions on freedom of the press.

(6) Friction Caused by Stilwell

In 1944, when the Sino-American wartime alliance reached its lowest point, General Stilwell, the commander of the US forces in the China-Burma-India Theater, considered withdrawing the US Fourteenth Air Force from China. I am not prepared to say whether he had formally proposed this to the US War Department or whether he merely used it as one of Stilwell's last threats to Chongqing. Only the archives of the theater or the testimony of those who participated in the final negotiations before Stilwell was recalled in 1944 can fully reveal the details. In my opinion, this is an example of Stilwell taking various steps to expand his power in China, completely disregarding its possible impact. Given the deteriorating situation in China at the time, such an action, or even threatening such an action, would have caused complete chaos if the threat had been made public. At that time, the Fourteenth Air Force was the only effective military force in China that enjoyed public trust.

Regardless of how drastic this approach was, there was indeed a desire at the time to draw the attention of the Chinese authorities to this matter. The first time I learned about this was when the Chinese privately inquired of me, hoping to know whether this plan would be implemented. The theater command did not provide me with any information on this issue. Now, in retrospect, I think of the sharp reduction in the tonnage of goods transported by the Fourteenth Air Force over The Hump, and the significant reduction in the goods handed over to the Chinese authorities. In my opinion, this reduction was another way for Stilwell to exert pressure on Chongqing, in addition to the actual withdrawal of the air force. In the autumn of 1943, a year before Stilwell was finally recalled, a friction occurred between the theater commander and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the severity of which was almost similar to the situation that later forced Stilwell to leave China. In fact, there was almost a demand to remove him from his post.

At that time, Stilwell had been assured by Madame Chiang Kai-shek that he would from then on obey the will and instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. I witnessed part of the situation. This assurance seemed to have been given after some conversation.

When I left this meeting, Madame Chiang Kai-shek's sister, Madame Kung, pulled me aside and told me, somewhat strangely, "General Stilwell has agreed to obey Chairman Chiang Kai-shek."

Even today, I still don't understand the origin of this strange assurance, but I am sure that even if Stilwell wanted to maintain the best relationship with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as the US military theater commander, he failed to make himself conform to his will in all aspects. So I assume that he made this promise without intending to keep it. It should be pointed out that their most intense disputes over the Burma campaign began immediately after the Cairo Conference in November 1943.

Based on my experience with the central government, I have found that friendly frankness is the only prerequisite for satisfactorily resolving mutual problems. For Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, I never found it necessary to conceal the truth, no matter how unpleasant the truth was. I always told him the facts as I saw them, and if the situation required corrective measures, those measures would come. Needless to say, when submitting critical reports, the position of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as the most influential and decisive figure in China, should be given due respect—but not to the point of kowtowing. In other words, friendly and effective relations only require an attitude of self-respect and respect for others that is due to the head of any country, if the friendship and assistance of these countries are valued by us.

Stilwell damaged Sino-American relations throughout his stay in China, and his degree of insult may have reached its peak at a press conference after Washington decided to recall him. Stilwell's words were of course "off the record," but like many "off the record" words, they were often printed later. I didn't keep a copy of the "Newsweek" that published this, so I can only rely on my memory.

As I recall, General Stilwell's evaluation of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek when he left Chongqing was a "deception."

### Security Council to Investigate Czech Coup Despite Soviet Opposition, Chiang Ting-fu Clarifies China's Position

[Associated Press, Lake Success, One-Day Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council, despite Soviet opposition, seems poised to order an investigation into the Soviet Union's role in the Czech Communist coup. The case is now scheduled for a formal vote next week. Although the Soviet Union and Ukraine are both vigorously opposed, China, the United States, Britain, France, Canada, and Syria have formally expressed their support. Argentina, Belgium, and Colombia have also indicated their intention to support the case. The required majority is seven votes.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 31st Dispatch] Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu today proposed a thorough investigation of the Czech incident, summoning key figures in the coup to the Security Council to explain the truth, and hoping that the Soviet Union would participate in this investigation. Chiang said that the Security Council and the world must face the Czech issue squarely and should not leave it for two or three to five years later. Chiang also compared the Czech issue to the Communist suppression war by the National Army in Northeast China, saying that both the Czech Republic and the northeastern provinces of China are cradles of conflict, and any special accident in either place is enough to shock the world. The United States advocates a full investigation of Chile's accusations that the Soviet Union assisted the Czech Communist Party in seizing power, and China expresses its support. Earlier, Chilean representative Cruz reiterated his country's request, urging the Security Council to investigate the Soviet Union's role in the Czech Communist coup and accusing the Soviet Union of being a reckless aggressor who would not hesitate to use hooligan tactics.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 31st Dispatch] The new representative of the Czech Communist government to the United Nations, Hu Tai-tek, today presented his credentials to the United Nations Secretary-General with a letter of appointment from Czech President Benes, stating that the former representative, Papanek, had been dismissed. Papanek still refuses to recognize the new representative's credentials, saying that he will not listen to it unless he receives a document personally signed by President Benes.

### Announcement of Convictions in Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) Corruption Case: Hou Aichang and Jiang Renlin Sentenced to Imprisonment, Dong Chengdao and Five Others Acquitted, Zheng Zhonghe and Du Cen Exempted from Prosecution, Lu Jiaju, Huo Yongzhang, and Chen Timin to be Tried Upon Apprehension

[Our Newspaper's Report] The district court announced the verdicts in the case of senior Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) officials accused of corruption yesterday afternoon in the Criminal Division One presided over by Judge Huang Guangyu. The main points of the judgment are as follows: Hou Aichang (former General Manager of the Materials Purchase and Sales Department of the Finance Department of CRRRA), for actions related to his duties, accepted improper benefits, sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, and deprived of civil rights for four years. Jiang Renlin (former Section Chief of the Welfare Section of CRRRA) embezzled public property, sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, and deprived of civil rights for four years. The two defendants were acquitted of other charges. Dong Chengdao (Director of the Finance Department), Hu Keshi (Director of the General Affairs Department), Tao Jingyuan (Section Chief of the Documentation Section), Pang Yuanlong (Section Chief of the Welfare Section), and Ding Tiansheng (Manager of the United Shengji Construction Factory) were all acquitted. Deng Zhonghe (General Manager of Anle Textile Factory) and Du Cen (Deputy Chief Auditor) were both exempted from prosecution. Excerpts of the judgment are listed below:

Hou Aichang's part (A) Regarding the sentencing: Hou Aichang was the General Manager of the Materials Purchase and Sales Department of CRRRA. The indictment alleged that he received a house to live in from Deng Zhonghe, the manager of Anle Textile Company, when he handled the sale of wool. The house is located at Room 15, 9th Floor, No. 1396 Yuyuan Road, which was originally leased by Deng Zhonghe and is now occupied by Hou Aichang. What should be investigated is whether Hou Aichang's residence in the house was in exchange for improper benefits related to his duties. Anle Textile Company purchased 1.12 million pounds of wool sold by CRRRA as relief supplies. Except for the state-owned China Textile Corporation, its purchase volume ranked first. Deng Zhonghe, the manager of the company, testified in court. However, the content and terms of the wool sales contract between CRRRA and Anle Company were found to be the same as those of other purchasers. It is difficult to equate it to actions that violated his duties, but the fact that Hou Aichang unconditionally accepted someone else's house to live in during the period of handling the sale of wool cannot be said to be unrelated to his duties. Next, let's discuss whether Hou Aichang received improper benefits. In other words, whether Deng Zhonghe gifted the house for residence. Deng Zhonghe argued, "The house was leased to him by Hou Aichang's relative, Wu Zhiwei," and presented a letter from Wu Zhiwei to Deng Zhonghe dated June 15, 35, and a business card from Deng Zhonghe to Wu Zhiwei as evidence during the investigation. The prosecutor believed that the letter was not delivered through the post office, and the writing on the business card was in pencil, so it was not difficult to fabricate them afterward, which is very true. Moreover, since the house was occupied by Hou Aichang and no lease contract was signed with Deng Zhonghe, it can be concluded that there was a gift of the house for residence. In order to find out the truth, this court inquired about the transfer of the electricity, telephone, and gas accounts of the house from Shanghai Electric Power Company, Shanghai Telephone Company, and Shanghai Gas Company respectively. According to the replies from the above three companies, all of them indicated that the account name was Hou Aichang, which proves that Hou Aichang's residence in the house was obviously unrelated to Wu Zhiwei, and the so-called lease by Wu Zhiwei is difficult to believe. Since he accepted someone else's house to live in during the period of handling the sale of wool, Hou Aichang's acceptance of improper benefits for actions related to his duties is undoubtedly conclusive evidence and should be punished in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 4 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. However, considering that the defendant has not violated his duties and that Shanghai was experiencing a housing shortage at the time, and he could not find a house to live in, it is not without compassion. Therefore, the original sentence is reduced and a term of imprisonment of three years and six months and deprivation of civil rights for four years is imposed to serve as a warning. The indictment alleged a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the same regulations, which does not match the facts of the crime, so the legal clauses of the indictment are changed, and this is explained.

(B) Regarding other parts—Sale of electric fans and barter of US cotton for yarn. Because there is no active evidence of the defendant's criminal intent, he should be acquitted in accordance with the law.

Jiang Renlin's part (A) Regarding the sentencing: Jiang Renlin's five million yuan of petty cash was used for advance payments of hotel revolving funds, and he had made advance payments of one million yuan to the Nanjing Hotel, 400,000 yuan to the Wu Palace Hotel, and no other hotels had been paid in advance, which the defendant admitted without hesitation. When the CRRRA General Accounting Office inspected on May 29, 35, the supporting documents contained private advances mixed in, which was clearly stated in the inspection report. Gao Qingxiao, the director of the Investigation Office of the CRRRA, was also ordered to inspect the section. There were still no account books for this petty cash. In addition to handing over 900,000 yuan in cash, the payment documents could not be handed over for review at one time, but were extracted in three installments. The initial figure handed over was 4,842,500 yuan, then changed to 5,032,570 yuan, then changed to 5,011,920 yuan. Finally, after reviewing the cuspidor receipt for 190,000 yuan, which should be deleted, the petty cash balance of the section was 4,821,920 yuan, a difference of 178,000 yuan. Gao Qingxiao, the director of the Investigation Office, not only made a written report, but also testified in court, which is credible. Moreover, Jiang Renlin claimed at the time that the 190,000 yuan for the porcelain cuspidor was advanced by him, while Chen Tingchang, the person in charge, claimed that the money was advanced by him, as evidenced by the interrogation record of the office, with Chen Tingchang's private seal affixed to it. How can he use excuses to avoid responsibility? Therefore, the defendant Jiang Renlin's embezzlement of public property is undoubtedly guilty and should be punished in accordance with Article [number unclear] of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. However, considering that the suspect only occupied a small number, and the circumstances are pitiful, a reduced sentence of imprisonment for three years and six months, and deprivation of civil rights for four years, is imposed to serve as a warning.

(B) Regarding the remaining parts: The shortage of Japanese-retained furniture in Ruifengli, the repair of houses in Ruifengli, and the purchase of iron beds and office tables and chairs, were accused of engaging in private malfeasance. Due to insufficient evidence, they are acquitted.

Parts for Dong Chengdao and Others: The remaining points of the accusations against Dong Chengdao, Tao Jingyuan, Hu Keshi, Pang Yuanlong, and Ding Tiansheng all lack active corroboration, and they are acquitted in accordance with the law.

Part for Zheng Zhonghe: As for Zheng Zhonghe's part, when he paid improper benefits to Hou Aichang in July 35, the indictment alleged that he violated Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. The most severe penalty for this is imprisonment for a term of not more than three years. In accordance with the provisions of Item A of the National Government's Amnesty and Commutation Order, he should be acquitted. Part for Du Cen: The indictment alleged that Du Cen violated Article 9 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. The most severe penalty for this article is imprisonment for a term of not more than three years. Even if the crime committed by the defendant is real, since it was before December 31, 35, according to the above explanation, a judgment of acquittal should be pronounced.

As for the defendant Lu Jiaju, who went to the United States on official business, he was not legally summoned, and he will be tried separately after his apprehension. In addition, the two defendants, Huo Yongzhang and Chen Timin, have not been arrested despite orders to do so, and they will be tried again after they are apprehended. This is also explained.

### Rather Sit in Jail Than Return Home, Flying General's Marital Dispute Case, His Wife Du Qin Detained

[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Prosecutor's Office held a hearing on the marital dispute case between Flying General Wang Zhuo and his wife Du Qin yesterday, and Du Qin was detained. Before the hearing, relatives and friends of the Wang and Du families came forward to mediate. Du Qin insisted on a divorce, and Wang Zhuo's side agreed to consider a divorce, but only if she guaranteed that she would not marry her lover [unclear] who was studying in the United States. Because Du Qin loved Tan Xiqie deeply, she did not agree to this condition. When the court opened yesterday, Wang requested two points from the prosecutor: if Du Qin is found guilty, please prosecute her; if Du Qin is found not guilty, please hand her over to him to take home for discipline. He said that Du Qin's guarantors were unreliable and that she might flee. The prosecutor immediately asked Du Qin whether she was willing to go home with Wang Zhuo. Du said that she would rather sit in jail than return home. At this point, the prosecutor immediately detained Du Qin and postponed the hearing.

### Stabilizing the Index: New Methods Under Consideration; Social Affairs Bureau Director Advocates Organizing a Joint Distribution Center for Daily Necessities

[Our Own Report] The city's Labor-Management Arbitration Committee, at its 18th meeting, resolved to send a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau suggesting that the central government increase the types and quantities of in-kind provisions for workers (i.e., adding clothing items in addition to rice, coal, oil, and sugar) and reduce the allocated prices, in order to stabilize the price index and prevent it from increasing monthly. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday: "Expanding the allocation of daily necessities for workers is certainly the best way to suppress the cost of living index. However, the government has already done what it can. Currently, further expanding allocations is quite difficult due to the shortage of materials. I personally advocate organizing a joint distribution center for workers' daily necessities in the city. Various factories would supply the distribution center with products related to the cost of living, and these would be allocated to workers throughout the city at cost price. In this way, workers can obtain allocations at low prices, and the cost of living index can be compiled based on the allocated prices. The Social Affairs Bureau will convene responsible parties from several important industrial trade associations in the city next week to discuss this matter."

A Problem That Is Still Difficult to Solve

Director Wu also stated that the principle of this method has been established, but there is one difficulty worth considering: factories such as machinery plants and cement plants cannot supply the joint distribution center with daily necessities, but their workers' wages would still be calculated based on the cost of living index compiled from the allocated prices. The authorities can only compile one type of index, and factories should enjoy the benefits universally, and their obligations must also be universal. He has not yet come up with a solution to this difficulty and will raise it for discussion at next week's meeting.

(2) Liu, Zhou, and Zhang did not propose the terms "equal work" and "sit-in." (3) The Joint Newsletter and Joint Newsletter Express cannot prove that the accused was the organizer, and there is no incitement language in it. Liu and the other two's usual behavior was explained by the Bank of China as being quite peaceful, and there was no crime of disturbing order, so they were not prosecuted.

Vast Losses Due to Excessive Electricity Theft Transferred from Electric Current Purchased in Bulk

### The Person in Charge of the Dahao Electric Plant Explains the Truth About Collecting Electricity Fees

Vast Losses Due to Excessive Electricity Theft Transferred from Electric Current Purchased in Bulk

The electrical business in Dahao, Liuhe, Gucun, and other places not far from Shanghai has always been operated by the Daluo Electric Plant. Recently, some users in the area petitioned the Public Utilities Bureau and other places due to electricity fee issues, and released statements to reporters, believing that the electricity fees set by the plant were higher than in the urban area, expressing their dissatisfaction. To clarify the truth, the Central News Agency reporter specially visited the person in charge of the plant, who said: Due to the complex environment in the area, the company's business could not be promoted. Therefore, after the victory, Wang Yingru initially resumed the business, followed by Tian Rongyu taking over, but both were unable to continue due to income not covering expenses. Recently, it was reorganized into a joint-stock company, and the business was entrusted to the Far East Electric Investment Company for management, with the aim of seeking business and technical improvements to reduce costs and achieve rational development. The plant has no power generation equipment, and the current supplied is purchased in bulk from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in the city. Therefore, the electricity price charged could not be consistent with the urban area. In the past, the difference was about a 100% increase. In fact, due to excessive electricity theft and outdated equipment, the loss of electricity alone was about 50%. Now, since the reorganization into a joint-stock company in February, the electricity price set is only 50% higher than the cost of electricity, barely enough to pay for the electricity purchased. All other expenses are completely uncovered. Now, the company is making every effort to rectify the situation, and the percentage of electricity loss has been slightly reduced. With perseverance and gradual improvement, users and the company will surely benefit. The company's electricity price for February has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, so it is temporarily charged according to the January electricity price. After approval, any surplus will be refunded, and any shortfall will be collected. Therefore, it will be proved by the facts at that time whether the electricity price is higher or lower than before, and whether it is exploiting users to seek exorbitant profits. Moreover, more than 80% of the users in the area have already paid in advance according to the January electricity price, which shows that most users can understand, and a small number of users are indeed misunderstanding.

In the future, other businesses will be handled in order, depending on the needs of the various military and political organizations.

[Our Report] According to people in the real estate industry yesterday, since the maximum rent was set at 7,000 times for residential use and 9,000 times for commercial use, the already sparse real estate transactions in the city have become virtually frozen.

Transactions of occupied houses (i.e., houses with tenants) are almost non-existent. The transaction volume of vacant houses is only 70% of what it used to be.

### Rice Prices Rebound Yesterday After Increase in Rationed Rice Prices; Flour Merchants Held Firm, More Stable Than Before

Rice prices rose slightly yesterday in the Nanshi market, and stabilized in the Beishi market. Although the Nanshi market rose, the actual sales were still normal, so the market softened later. The morning opening was boosted by the high price of rationed rice for the second phase, reaching 3.1 million yuan, and the Civil Food Allocation Association did not sell rice on the market yesterday, which boosted public sentiment. Moreover, the price had fallen sharply the previous day, and merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, increasing them by 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Although rice prices rose yesterday, the sales were flat. Local shops mainly sell rationed rice and rarely supplement from the market, so the market slightly softened later. Prices in the Beishi market changed little, with only early rice and special indica rice rising slightly by 50,000 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 6,045 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets.

Flour rose slightly. Because it had fallen rapidly for several days, merchants repeatedly wanted to reverse the decline.

### The Export-Import Management Committee has No Office Expenses; It Plans to Levy a Handling Fee on Imported Goods

Import and export industries are calling for opposition from all parties

According to sources from the Export-Import Management Committee, the government's budget did not include regular office expenses for the committee, resulting in a lack of funds. Therefore, it is proposed that the Executive Yuan authorities levy a handling fee of 1/1000 on imported goods, which will be collected when importers apply for an import permit, to cover the committee's office expenses. This measure is currently being reviewed by the Executive Yuan's Full Economic Committee, and whether it will be implemented has not yet been decided. This news has been confirmed by the committee. The Shanghai Import and Export Industry Association is greatly concerned and expresses its opposition. Because the committee's expenses should not be passed on to import manufacturers, it is actually setting up a pretext to collect fees. It is also said that the total annual import volume of China is about 400 million US dollars. If 1/1000 is levied, it will be 400,000 US dollars, equivalent to 100 billion yuan in national currency. Importers firmly oppose this.

### Cigarettes Declined Yesterday

Yesterday's cigarette market, the morning opening saw local shops still actively stocking up, and the buying sentiment in the market was strong, driving prices higher.

In the afternoon, many operators with tight positions dumped their holdings, and the market became sluggish again. Finally, ten packs of British American Tobacco and Old Knife cigarettes plummeted by 4.3 to 5 million yuan compared to the previous day, and other domestic and foreign cigarettes were also weak and lifeless.

### Floating Long Positions Frequently Sold Off; Yarn and Cotton Markets Sluggish; Fabric Sales Stagnant and Transactions Sparse

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw unstable sentiment, weak buyer interest, and a reluctance to buy among local yarn merchants and replicating factories. As a result, general floating long positions began to sell off, causing prices to turn from stable to sluggish.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially remained above the 200 million yuan mark, but due to the opportunistic selling by the platform group, asking prices collapsed to 190 million yuan. Near the close, opportunistic counter-trading brought prices back to 192 million yuan, but it still closed 11 million yuan lower than the previous day.

21-count Double Horse yarn opened at 124 million yuan, but due to selling from floating short positions, it plummeted to 117 million yuan at the close, down 7 million yuan from the previous day.

Other coarse and fine yarns such as 20-count, 16-count, 10-count, 40-count, and 32-count also fell by 4-5 million to 6-7 million and 13-14 million yuan, respectively.

Also, yesterday's cotton cloth market saw the Spinning and Weaving Corporation supply goods again, which coincided with falling yarn prices and weak buyer interest. General retail investors sold off at high prices and bought in when prices were low. Cloth merchants also sold off at high prices, resulting in active market trading but few actual transactions and a hovering and sluggish market.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 4.17 million yuan and rose to a high price of 4.27 million yuan due to buying from speculative longs. However, cloth merchants took advantage of the high prices to compete for sales, pulling prices back to 4.16 million yuan at the close, leveling with the previous day. However, Blue Chicken and colored ball fine cloth rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan. Other broadcloth, Zhigong, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and ten-link cloth saw mixed results.

### Vice Minister Tian Peilin Reports on the Grand Occasion of the Taiwan Provincial Cultural Relics Exhibition

[Report from Nanjing, 1st of the month] The Taiwan Cultural Relics Exhibition opened in Taiwan Province a few days ago. The Ministry of Education has just received a report from Vice Minister Tian Peilin, who went to preside over the exhibition, regarding the exhibition situation.

According to the report: The exhibition is divided into three categories: (1) Calligraphy and painting, provided by Shanghai collectors, including authentic works of handwriting from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties by Su Shi, Wen Yanbo, Wang Shouren, Huang Daozhou, Shen Baozhen, and others, as well as paintings by various famous artists since the Song dynasty. (2) Books, from the collection of the Central Library, with a focus on systematically demonstrating that woodblock printing and movable type were invented in our country. Woodblock printing began in the Tang dynasty, became popular in the late Tang dynasty, and movable type was invented in the Song dynasty. (3) Bronze ware (including bronze mirrors), ceramics (including pottery figurines), and compasses. Bronze casting had good inventions and achievements in ancient times. The prehistoric Gansu "Painted Pottery" had already been successful. Glazing was known in the Han dynasty, there was tricolor in the Tang dynasty, and porcelain was invented. Porcelain improved further after the Song dynasty, and porcelain in the Qing dynasty became even more developed. Pottery figurines are funerary objects, and the clothing and accessories of the Han and Tang dynasties can be seen in general, which are good specimens for the history of sculpture. The compass is from the Central Museum. In the Han dynasty, there was a "Sinan" (South-pointing chariot), which was divided into 24 directions to distinguish directions. In the early Song dynasty, a prototype of the modern compass was made, which was used in navigation. The above exhibits illustrate the superiority of Chinese culture, which has a unique style in the world of art. The invention of the compass made it possible to discover the New World, and the printing technology was transmitted to Europe, providing a shortcut for cultural dissemination and increasing unlimited happiness for mankind. The Taiwanese compatriots have gained a deeper understanding of the motherland by seeing the history of the past.

### Reader Consultation

Legal Interpretation

Disputes Arising from Inability to Relocate Due to Important Business Location

Lu Fan asks: My friend, Mr. A, runs a small shop in Shanghai, and the property belongs to Mr. B. Mr. B's family is declining and plans to sell the house, but A cannot afford to buy it. I have several questions and respectfully request answers:

(1) If the property is purchased by a third party (C), can the purchaser reclaim it for their own use based on property rights? (2) A has been a long-term tenant for decades and has never been late with rent. Because the shop is located in an important location and has a good reputation, it is difficult to relocate. I wonder if A has the legal right to continue to lease the property with C? (3) If C forces A to move, can A demand compensation for all losses incurred due to relocation?

[Answer by Lawyer Fu Kuang] (1) C's acquisition of the ownership of B's house naturally belongs to the right to dispose of it and can be freely used for income. A, as the original tenant of the house, can continue to lease the property from C according to Article 425 of the Civil Code. (3) A's business losses and renting the house are separate matters. Compensation for damages cannot be claimed from the lessor due to relocation issues.

### Problem of Tuberculosis Prevention

— Qian Mu Han

Before discussing the problem of tuberculosis prevention, we must understand the severity of tuberculosis, also known as consumption. This disease is prevalent worldwide. In all civilized countries of Europe, America, and Asia, the incidence and mortality rates of this disease are higher than those of other infectious diseases. In recent years, due to the advancement of public health in European and American countries, the mortality rate has significantly decreased. However, in our country, this disease is still extremely prevalent. Currently, there are no nationwide statistics, but according to partial surveys in Beiping, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, the mortality rate is approximately 300 deaths per 100,000 people per year. Based on the national population, more than one million people die from this disease annually. Considering that for every death from tuberculosis, there are ten patients, it is estimated that approximately ten million people in our country suffer from this disease each year.

This disease is a "cultural disease." Civilized countries have extremely high infection rates, and cities are more affected than rural areas. According to surveys in various regions, almost no adult in our country can avoid infection. However, "infection" means having been exposed to tubercle bacilli, not necessarily that every person has contracted the disease. According to a report by Dr. Lai Douyan in Shanghai in 1934, the infection rate for ages 0 to 4 was 9.3% in urban areas and 5.7% in rural areas. For ages 5 to 9, it was 53.3% in urban areas and 32.2% in rural areas. For ages 10 to 14, it was 72.0% in urban areas and 49.3% in rural areas. For ages 15 to 19, it was 81.8% in urban areas and 63.0% in rural areas. The degree of infection is directly proportional to age. Tuberculosis can infect various organs in the human body, but it is most likely to infect the lungs. The percentage is above 80%, so tuberculosis prevention must focus on preventing pulmonary tuberculosis. The first method of tuberculosis prevention is vaccination with the anti-tuberculosis vaccine, BCG. The principle of immunization is the same as that of vaccination against smallpox. However, its immune function is only about 7:1. That is, the tuberculosis rate for unvaccinated individuals is 7%, while the tuberculosis rate for vaccinated individuals drops to 1%. Before BCG vaccination, a tuberculin test must be performed. If the reaction is positive, it indicates that tubercle bacilli have already invaded the body, so vaccination is not suitable. The second method of tuberculosis prevention is early diagnosis, which can be achieved through widespread screening using small fluoroscopy X-ray machines. The cost is extremely low, and the work is quick. Early pulmonary tuberculosis is easily curable. Artificial pneumothorax surgery is very effective, even if hospitalization is not time-consuming. For acute cases, streptomycin injections may lead to full recovery. The third method of tuberculosis prevention is strict isolation of patients with active tuberculosis. Any sputum, feces, or other excrement containing tubercle bacilli must be disinfected to prevent transmission to others, and home isolation requires special attention. The fourth method of tuberculosis prevention is health education. This allows the general public to understand the causes of tuberculosis, the seriousness of transmission routes, and prevention methods. In particular, indiscriminate spitting is the most dangerous. Recently, public figures have raised a large sum of money to promote a campaign to discourage spitting. We can see clear slogans discouraging spitting in public places and on lampposts, which is of no small benefit to the population. In addition, the use of sanitary chopsticks is equally important. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in society will vigorously promote this, and the future results of tuberculosis prevention should be able to eradicate the disease.

### Good Methods for Overcoming Addiction to Anesthetics

— Liang Jun Qing

According to a report by Mr. Lodinos of Alexandria, Egypt, he used Mr. M. Vivian's method to help patients overcome addiction to anesthetics in a total of eighty cases. The results were excellent and worthy of introduction to colleagues. Here is a brief translation:

According to Modianos, after using this method to overcome addiction, patients can stop taking anesthetics without any withdrawal symptoms. However, it is impossible to prevent patients from wanting to relapse into this addiction (in fact, no good method of overcoming addiction can remove the patient's psychological attachment to the addictive substance). Even though patients have overcome the addiction, their psychological attachment is not easily changed, and some still think about using the addictive substance one or two years later. In addition, patients often have a psychological fear that they will become weak after overcoming the addiction and unable to cope with various illnesses caused by weakness. As a result, this psychological build-up over time leads to genuine illnesses and the need to rely on addictive substances. According to Mr. Ma's opinion, it is best to travel for several months after overcoming addiction, or at least not to return to the original lifestyle in a short period (for example, opera singers should not resume their opera-singing life within three months after overcoming addiction), otherwise, it is very easy to relapse into the original addiction. According to experience, the longer the period of using addictive substances, the more difficult it is to overcome the addiction.

This method of overcoming addiction can be used to overcome addictions to morphine, heroin, cocaine, and alcohol. The method is as follows:

For example, consider a patient who is addicted to morphine, whose daily intake is 0.3gm and who has been addicted for five years. To help them overcome the addiction, on the first day, three blistering plasters are applied to the upper thigh in the morning. Each plaster is about four cubic centimeters in size, and the distance between each plaster should not be too far so that they can be covered with a large piece of gauze. If there is a lot of leg hair, it must be shaved off. Usually, by the morning of the second day, a large blister has formed under each plaster (similar to a burn). At about 10 or 11 am, the plaster should be gently removed to avoid breaking the blister. Then, use a 10 cc syringe with a thicker needle to extract the liquid from the blister and inject the liquid (the patient's own serum) into the patient's buttock muscle using a thinner needle. If the serum in the blister leaks out when the plaster is removed because the blister sac has already broken, a sterilized glass tube can be used to collect it, then use a syringe to extract it and inject it into the patient's buttock muscle. If there is sediment in the serum, it must be removed before injection. After the serum has been extracted from the blister, a sterile gauze with a mild ointment, such as boric acid ointment, should be used to wrap it to protect the wound. If the amount of serum extracted for the first time is only about 5 cc, it must be re-extracted the next day. This method of blistering and extracting serum must be performed three times, once every three days. As for morphine, 0.7gm of morphine can be given on the second day after the serum injection, and then 0.12mp on the third day, 0.15gm on the fourth day, 0.7gm on the fifth day, 0.06 on the sixth day, 0.03 on the seventh day, and 0.015mp on the eighth day. From the ninth day, morphine can be discontinued. Starting on the sixth day, 0.06 of codeine can be added to the injection in addition to morphine. The amount of codeine is determined by the amount of morphine reduced and the patient's needs. If the patient has insomnia, anxiety, and limb pain, 0.06 of codeine can be injected three or four times. This codeine injection does not cause as much pain as morphine when injected subcutaneously, and it is easy for the patient to recognize. At this time, it is necessary to deal with it carefully and prevent the patient from noticing it. Although codeine is not as addictive as morphine, if the patient knows about it, it can easily affect their psychology.

Starting from the eighth or ninth day, emetine can be injected into the patient (this drug is especially effective for alcoholics). Inject 0.03 or 0.02gm subcutaneously once a day, about seven days, then change to injecting once every other day, and after fourteen days, change to injecting once every two days. (And so on.)

The most important thing to pay attention to when overcoming addiction is not to let the patient know the name of the drug used by the doctor each time. It is best to declare to the patient at the beginning of treatment that you will not answer any questions about medical issues in the future, so that they give up asking. If fatigue, pain, and other phenomena occur during the withdrawal period, glucose, calcium, and vitamins can be injected to treat them. If the withdrawal symptoms (i.e., addiction symptoms) are too severe, a slightly larger amount of morphine can be injected than the last injection. If the morphine has been reduced to zero, 0.02-0.03gm can be injected, but of course, this cannot be told to the patient to avoid adverse psychological changes. The above methods and dosages are of course different for each person and cannot be rigidly adhered to. Sometimes, a fourth blistering and serum extraction operation may be necessary in fact. Sometimes, the disease is completely cured after one or two blistering and serum extraction operations. In short, it is necessary to deal with it well.

If the patient has insomnia, Chloralbydrat or Paraldehyd can be given to him, and it will definitely be effective. We know that the addiction has been truly overcome when the patient is energetic, has an increased appetite, and can sleep peacefully after overcoming the addiction. If he can travel for two or three months after overcoming the addiction, or at least let him rest for two or three months without immediately resuming his original life, his recovery will be truly guaranteed. On the other hand, if the patient seeks painkillers after overcoming the addiction, his psychology will be shaken again, and he will inevitably be in danger of relapsing into the old disease.

### Good Medicine for Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Xu Jin

Up to now, all medicines for pulmonary tuberculosis can be said to have no absolute efficacy. Although streptomycin, which has been widely promoted in newspapers and magazines recently, has been proven in animal experiments to have the absolute efficacy of inhibiting the reproduction of tubercle bacilli, its clinical trials are still limited to certain types of tuberculosis and have not fully met expectations. In addition, streptomycin is scarce, expensive, and its treatment time is very long, which is beyond the reach of ordinary patients. As for the clinical efficacy of streptomycin for tuberculosis, there are no statistics for the time being, and no rash judgment can be made. However, according to the experience of foreign doctors, it is very effective for miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis. What was once thought to be an incurable disease now has cases of complete cure, which can be considered a happy event.

I have also personally encountered a case of miliary tuberculosis, which was cured with streptomycin. The patient was a four-year-old boy who suddenly lost weight and had no appetite. Afterwards, his body temperature rose and remained high. Traditional Chinese medicine thought it was typhoid fever, but it was not cured after a long time. So I asked my colleague, Dr. Ni, to diagnose and treat him. After careful examination, Dr. Ni suggested testing blood and fluoroscopically examining the lungs. As a result, the blood test showed no typhoid reaction. The X-ray showed light gray lungs covered with millet grains. Dr. Ni diagnosed it as miliary tuberculosis. He held the photo and discussed it with me. I suggested treating it with streptomycin and asked him to pay attention to the consequences. Four months later, Dr. Ni told me that the patient had gone to Hangzhou with his parents to recuperate. Since starting streptomycin, the situation has been very good, the weight has obviously increased, and the fever has gradually subsided. However, for four months, the medication has not been interrupted (more than one hundred bottles of streptomycin have been injected). The patient was initially the only child, and his family was willing to bear any high burden to prolong his life. However, since his parents had a new son, the patient had lost his center of love, so they said they were going to Hangzhou to recuperate. The treatment was interrupted. However, comparing the X-ray photos before and after treatment, the disease has greatly improved. Without streptomycin, the patient may have died long ago.

However, streptomycin is mostly ineffective for the third stage of active pulmonary tuberculosis. According to clinical experiments, the role of streptomycin is to inhibit the growth of bacteria, not to kill bacteria. According to the latest reports, the US government has banned the export of streptomycin because it is still in the experimental stage and does not have the rumored efficacy for human pulmonary tuberculosis. It may have an inhibitory effect on complications or variants of pulmonary tuberculosis, but it does not have an absolute effect on tubercle bacilli in the human body. As for urethral tuberculosis and kidney tuberculosis, it is known to be ineffective. Therefore, the scope of treatment with streptomycin today has been greatly reduced and cannot replace symptomatic treatment methods such as air needles. Everything remains to be worked on by experts.

### Editor's Note

Because the newspaper has reduced its size, the position of this publication has also shrunk. This is an inevitable measure in the midst of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, and it is also something that cannot be helped. However, precisely because of this, our editing work has become even more difficult, because to cope with smaller publications, we must change to another editing policy. At the same time, we hope that readers will also look at it with another perspective!

We are very sorry that many long manuscripts have been returned due to the above reasons. At the same time, we are also very sorry that many manuscripts that do not conform to the new style of this publication are no longer adopted. May the country be peaceful soon, and there will still be the same amount of space as before in the future!

Many readers write to ask about the causes or treatments of various diseases. As long as it is described in detail and sufficient postage and address are attached, we will definitely try to reply.

### Artificial Teeth

— Feng Zikai

I am fifty years old, and I only have seventeen teeth left in my mouth, and most of them are loose. But I have a good appetite and still want to eat something in this world. So, I contacted a reader, Yi Zhaoxue, who is a dentist, and asked him to pull out all seventeen of my useless teeth and install a full set of dentures. I don't like the word "fake," so I call them "artificial teeth." If you don't have a son, you adopt an orphan. This son is called an "adopted son." If you don't have teeth, you install dentures, and these teeth can of course be called "artificial teeth."

Yi Zhaoxue, the dentist, pulled out seventeen teeth from my mouth in eleven days. I didn't feel any pain at all, so I wrote him a four-character couplet: "Advancing in the way, man repeatedly triumphs over heaven." The first line has already been proven; the second line is my hope, which has not yet been proven. A month later, my gums shrank, so I went to take a mold and make artificial teeth. Early in the morning, my artificial teeth were indeed installed, neat, white, and very beautiful. Looking in the mirror, I looked twenty years younger!

However, it was very uncomfortable in my mouth. Holding two large pieces of something, it seemed temporary, and I often wanted to spit them out. When the tongue licked up, it was not my own flesh, but a stone slab, which was even more unnatural. When I spoke, the pronunciation was unclear, as if my tongue was swollen. Especially when eating something, I couldn't chew it tightly, and the upper and lower gums were very painful. I couldn't chew anything harder than rice, so I swallowed everything whole. Sometimes I wanted to practice. When eating porridge in the morning, I stubbornly put a peanut into my right molar, endured the pain and chewed hard. The peanut didn't break, but all the molars on the left side were raised. After rising, the rice grains in my mouth went into the middle of the gums and artificial teeth, and it hurt even more when I chewed again. So I had to stop eating porridge and take off the artificial teeth to wash them; I also rinsed my mouth with water, and then put them back on. Since I installed them on New Year's Day, for about a month, my artificial teeth were only good for looking at and not for use. In the meantime, I had to visit Yi Zhaoxue every day or two because my gums often hurt, so I asked him to modify the artificial teeth. After this part was repaired, it didn't hurt; but the next day, another part hurt, so I went to ask him to repair it again. From the beginning of the tooth extraction until a month after the installation, within about eighty or ninety days, I visited Yi Zhaoxue no less than dozens of times. I was like a teacher in Yi Zhaoxue's school, taking a rickshaw to attend class every day or two. From my home to Yi's house, the scenery, houses, and shops on the road were all familiar to me. I memorized all the words on the signboards. There were two children from a small household at the corner, a boy and a girl, the boy was about five years old, and the girl was about three years old, and they were very cute. Every time my rickshaw pulled past their door, I would pay attention to these two children. Sometimes they were playing; sometimes they were eating sweet potatoes; sometimes the younger one was crying, and the older one was scolding him; sometimes the two were fighting, all of which were very good to watch. I remember one time when I came back from repairing my teeth, the older one was gone, leaving only the younger one sitting alone on the threshold, pouting her little lips. I was very suspicious and worried. I wanted to stop the car and ask her, "Where did your brother go?" "Why are you worried?" But I felt that this was too abrupt, too meddlesome, and too inhuman, so I didn't ask after all. But this day I was always suspicious and always worried. Until the second time I went to repair my teeth, I saw these two children playing together as before, and I was relieved. Now, my artificial teeth have long been useful and don't need to be repaired. I haven't visited Yi Zhaoxue for a long time. I wonder if these two children are well. I really want to go and see them once. But wouldn't that be even more abrupt, more meddlesome, and more inhuman? I shouldn't go!

I've strayed too far from the topic! Let's quickly get back to my artificial teeth. Strangely enough, about a month after the installation, these artificial teeth gradually got better. There was no discomfort in my mouth at all, the pronunciation was very accurate, the gums were not full at all, and I could chew anything. In short, it could be said that they were the same as "real teeth."

I carefully tasted them, and there were two reasons why they got better: First, the gums were pressed by the stone slab for a month or two, and the skin became old and the resistance became stronger. Before, when I had "real teeth," I used the roots of my teeth to resist when chewing, and the gums were never responsible. So the gums were very tender and had no resistance. No wonder they couldn't bear the heavy pressure when they were first installed and had to hurt. Now that they are used to being pressed and used to chewing, they know that they will have to work hard from now on and strive to exercise, and they can actually succeed. From then on, the gums took over the duties of the tooth roots. Second, installing artificial teeth is like a primitive man who always used his fingers to eat using chopsticks for the first time. At first, the technique of holding chopsticks was very clumsy. I felt that using these two bamboo sticks to take food was so awkward and useless! It was so convenient and happy to take it directly with my fingers! But you must make him use chopsticks and never allow him to use his fingers. After training, he would actually get used to using them. Later, the technique of using chopsticks greatly improved. He could clip, mix, pull, pick, cut, and tear... It was as directly and happily, sensitively and conveniently as with his fingers. Installing artificial teeth is exactly the same as this primitive man using chopsticks. When they were first installed, one side had to be raised when the other side was chewing; the artificial teeth would be stuck off when eating glutinous rice balls; the upper and lower teeth could not be aligned when biting melon seeds; the broken layers of food would accumulate between the artificial teeth and the gums... All of these were due to poor skills. After a month or two of corrections, the skills improved, and the above-mentioned shortcomings were completely gone. Yi Zhaoxue's clinic is decorated with the four-character couplet I gave him: "Skill is in the way, man-made triumphs over heaven." When I used to go to repair my teeth, I felt very uncomfortable when I saw the last four words. I thought, "Man-made" may not be able to "triumph over heaven"! I praised him! I exaggerated too much! I made an advertisement for him with lies! This is so boring and unkind, and I really regret it. But the day before yesterday, I visited him for no reason, and I saw this four-character couplet again, and I was very happy. I didn't praise him, I didn't lie, and my hope was indeed realized! A few days ago, Mr. Zhang Xuecun from the Kaiming Bookstore came to drink with me. When we talked about this couplet, he made another one for me wittily:

Yi Ya can know the taste,
Bang Tong believes in talent.

I drank a large cup for this divinely crafted five-character couplet. This is much better, more accurate, and more ingenious than my four-character couplet. Yi Zhaoxue might as well change his name to Yi Ya. When his clinic expands, I want to write this five-character couplet again and send it to him. (March 28, 1948, West Lake.)

### Hotel School

— Leng Leng

There is a private vocational school in a coastal state in the northern United States. Every year, at the beginning of summer vacation, the entire school holds a thorough cleaning. All blackboards, podiums, desks, and chairs are removed and piled up in the basement. The offices and classrooms are painted and renovated, looking brand new. The interior is decorated with exquisite furniture, and each classroom is decorated as a luxurious bedroom. In less than half a month, a school is transformed into a seaside hotel.

The principal serves as the manager, the faculty members act as accountants and head waiters, and the chef serves as the head waiter. Both male and female students receive short-term waiter training and serve as waiters.

Because the school is located on the coast, the temperature is moderate in midsummer, with a cool breeze, making it an ideal summer resort. In addition, the hotel is fully equipped - with sports fields, swimming pools, libraries, billiard rooms, and clubs. The service is attentive and the room rates are low, so every summer, wealthy gentlemen and ladies from all over come to escape the summer heat. The seaside hotel is always bustling with guests and hangs a "full" sign.

The net profit of the hotel's business is entirely allocated to funding, and no tuition or miscellaneous fees are charged according to regulations. Students can donate real objects to the best of their ability, regardless of quality or quantity. Even poor people who cannot afford to donate can enroll.

Therefore, after each semester starts, the farm is always raising cattle, sheep, pigs, etc., and the warehouse is full of flour, sugar, canned food, and hotel daily necessities.

The founder of the school was originally from a university. He spent his early years as a waiter and later became the manager of a large hotel. He felt that vocational education was not practical, so he decided to allocate funds to establish the school, so that knowledge and practice could be integrated. However, the school does not only have a hotel department, but also other practical departments such as machinery and civil engineering, and also has workshops and surveying instruments for practical training.

Most of the students in the school are children of the working class. Students in all departments must take turns serving as waiters. The purpose is to allow students to come into contact with high-ranking people before entering society and indirectly learn about human relations, which is of great benefit to serving society in the future. Moreover, students are mostly self-respecting and self-loving, and do their best in their positions, which has won high praise from tourists. Some have even been introduced to jobs by previous tourist patrons after graduation. Students can not only enroll for free, but also gain valuable experience in dealing with people, which helps their future careers. Isn't this a win-win situation?

Looking back at our country's schools, most of them are closed-door operations, and graduates do not meet the actual needs of society. Most can only get a position as a probationer or trainee, and must undergo special training. Many run into walls everywhere and are unemployed at home. Isn't this a waste of countless talents, time, and money?

Of course, our country lacks material conditions, and it is not easy to improve education. However, I hope that the education authorities will pay more attention and gradually promote practical vocational education. Then the students will be fortunate! Education will be fortunate! The country will be fortunate!

### Slim Bamboo Cures Seals

— Xi Ya

The achievement of art must first progress from restraint to unrestrainedness, as the saying goes, "Without rules, there can be no squares or circles." Then, it must return from unrestrainedness to meticulousness, which is the so-called maturity of skill leading to simplicity. One who can pass through these three stages can reach a realm beyond the mundane. However, moving from the first to the second stage is easy, while moving from the second to the third stage is difficult. It requires decades of diligent study and, at the same time, broad and precise pursuit in academic fields; otherwise, one cannot discuss this matter. Because if one only focuses on learning artistic skills without studying other related disciplines, one inevitably becomes skilled in hand but lacking in vision, resulting in either vulgarity or ineptitude.

Zhen Jun Shou Zhu was fond of calligraphy and seal carving as early as his teens and devoted himself deeply to it, which was his period of moving from restraint to unrestrainedness. During the Anti-Japanese War, Qian Jun wandered in the Southwest. In those ten years, he carved seals for people everywhere and meticulously studied ancient epigraphic inscriptions, extending his knowledge to poetry, calligraphy, and painting, while also traveling to famous mountains and rivers. Therefore, his artistic expression reached a high level of skill and gradually transitioned from unrestrainedness to meticulousness, entering a new stage of art. Now, I am honored to introduce some of his recent works. The seal "Lin Xiao" imitates the style of Ding Yi. The three characters contain two 木 (wood) radicals and are symmetrical. If the composition is not proper, it will become rigid. Now, it is written in a staggered manner, which is not only lively and varied but also extremely beautiful. "Wan Xian Yi" uses many curves and oblique strokes in the zhuwen (seal script), showing vitality and refinement. "Mu Shi Zhi Zhu" pairs two larger characters with two smaller characters, arranging them in lines to fill the spaces, creating a compact and natural effect. The seals are ancient, diligent, lush, and refined, demonstrating ingenuity and reaching a transformative realm. It is said that Speaker Pan and others have urged him to stay in Shanghai and sell his carvings. He has set up a receiving point at Tong Gu Zhai, No. 59 Jiangxi Middle Road.

### On the Science of Marriage

— Bao Zhongqi

The news that Hujiang University plans to add "Courtship" and "Marriage" courses in the next semester has unexpectedly attracted the attention and approval of people in society. Standing from the perspective of a Hujiang student, I feel sincerely happy and am willing to strive to make it a reality.

First of all, let me report on the debate among the faculty and staff of Hujiang University regarding the establishment of these two courses:

On the evening of March 11th, Mrs. President Ling chaired the meeting and announced the issue for discussion. Professors who supported the establishment of "Courtship" and "Marriage" courses expressed positive opinions, emphasizing the unreasonableness of feudal, transactional marriages. However, modern young people often lack reasonable guidance when seeking a partner or after marriage, leading to various marital tragedies in society. Therefore, in addition to training "specialists," university courses should also pay attention to the cultivation of "generalists." It is necessary to have "Courtship" and "Marriage" courses so that young people can receive due guidance, enlightenment, and understanding regarding their own lifelong大事.

Professors who opposed the establishment of the two courses analyzed human courtship and marriage from scientific and religious perspectives, believing that marriage, from a biological point of view, is merely a way to reproduce life and perpetuate the race. Love, from a religious point of view, is governed by God and cannot be taught by teachers. Therefore, regarding the way of "Courtship" and "Marriage," the conclusion is that it is unnecessary to teach, impossible to teach, and no one can teach.

Finally, the chairman asked all faculty and staff to vote, and the result was 34 votes to 19, passing the motion to include "Courtship" and "Marriage" in the curriculum. Both the president and the academic dean voted in favor.

Now, what we think is worth discussing is: If these two courses are formally established, will they be required for every student? Or will they be elective courses and belong to which department?

In my personal opinion, it is not necessary to make them required. Fortunately, it concerns one's own life, and students will be eager to take them, thus avoiding conflict with the Ministry of Education's principle of reducing required credits. If they are elective courses, it would naturally be most appropriate to belong to the Department of Sociology, because this is originally a social problem!

I remember that in a recent "Free Talk" column, Mr. Wu Yong's article "The Socialization of Universities" was published. Therefore, this new measure of Hujiang University is undoubtedly the best expression of response. May this new education spread and grow in our country, and we bless ourselves and the students of the next generation.

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

A glass of wine plus a glass of water is equal to two glasses of water plus one glass of wine, leaving no wine at all.

People love to dream. Young people dream of tomorrow, and old people dream of yesterday, so "today" is the most hateful day.

If everyone knew their own weight, the balance of life would not tilt, because they would understand which side should hold more weight.

### "Impossible"?

— Ruzi

The world-renowned composer Liszt's personality was originally very amiable, but when he felt it necessary, he would arbitrarily do things that were extremely inhuman.

One day, a young composer brought his "proud work" to seek his advice. Liszt saw that his lyrics were extremely stiff and the melody was very disharmonious, so he pointed out the worst part and said to him, "This is impossible in music."

"But," the young man said proudly, "I have accomplished it."

Liszt smiled coldly, dipped his pen in ink, and then arbitrarily splashed it on his coat. "This is also possible," he said, "but it should not be done."

After saying that, he ran out to buy the young composer a new coat.

### Borrowing Books

— Tan Ke

Borrowing books from collectors often results in cold treatment. Therefore, collectors are often regarded as "miserly ghosts" and "book-guarding slaves." In fact, collectors also have their own difficulties. For example, precious books might be lost, pages might be torn or soiled... They worry about all of this. Whether this is excessive worry need not be discussed in detail. Let's take a look at the books in the library.

When you walk in, you see that most of the covers are already very worn, and the corners are curled. When you flip through the book, you will find the words "Read by so-and-so on such-and-such date" on the flyleaf, and the sentences next to them have been underlined. I don't know whether the library deliberately collects old books.

In my hometown, there are a few sayings about borrowing and returning books, saying, "Books should not be borrowed, once borrowed, they will be relied upon, even if you ask for them back quickly, the cover has been torn." I don't think this is an exaggeration. Although our country is a land of etiquette, and the ancient sages and philosophers have left behind many clear instructions, such as "extending oneself to others" and "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself," these have all become slogans. Many talkers, many understanders, but few doers. Especially when it comes to public property, there is a sense of indifference. The same goes for other people's things. There are not many who truly cherish them. "If it's broken, I'll just pay for it, what does it matter?" So, after borrowing a book, they stuff it in their pocket, the corners are creased, and the paper is softened. Anyway, it's not damaged, and the librarian doesn't say anything. Who cares! In this way, the book goes from new to old, to broken, to incomplete.

Then, how can we criticize the book collector for not lending out his books? Our "reputation" has been ruined!

### Wandering Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14 Wandering at Sea (116)

Zhu Zhai saw her attitude and wanted to follow her inside, but he was afraid that there would be her girlfriend inside, and she would scold him again in front of her face, which would be even more embarrassing. So, he just walked back and forth in the room. After about half an hour, seeing that Feng Sheng still hadn't come out, he couldn't bear it anymore and stood outside the room, calling out in a low voice, "Feng Sheng! Please come out, I have a few words to tell you." Feng Sheng responded from inside the room, "You go away! We have nothing to say." Zhu Zhai said, "Don't be angry, what I said today concerns the affairs of both of us." Feng Sheng still responded from inside the room, "There's nothing to talk about between us. We have already made an agreement, and everything will be handled according to the agreement. If you really can't do it, I will never force you. Don't worry." Zhu Zhai said, "Not for this, there is something else, come out and we can talk face to face." Feng Sheng seemed very angry and responded loudly, "No need! No need!" Then someone was heard quietly persuading her, and after a good while of murmuring, Feng Sheng said from inside the room with resentment, "How annoying!" As she said that, she had already walked out. Zhu Zhai saw her come out, with a smile all over his face, and first let her sit down, but Feng Sheng stood there, with her hands on her hips, and asked fiercely, "What do you want? Speak!" Zhu Zhai saw her face full of anger, that kind of cold look that was unbearable, and he still endured a stomach full of闷气 and said, "Sit down and we'll talk." Feng Sheng said, "No, if you have something to say, say it, if you don't have anything to say, please leave." Zhu Zhai said, "Feng Sheng! Why are you so impolite to me this time? I think, apart from the fact that your monthly fee for these two months was not sent on time due to inconvenience, there is nothing else that I'm sorry about!" Feng Sheng said, "You came just to explain these few sentences? Or is there something else? I didn't ask you for it when you couldn't send the money on time every month, and I've thought about it for a long time. I can't always rely on others alone. Now I rely on you to give me money every month. One day, if your circumstances don't allow it, would I really sue you? I would never do that." Zhu Zhai said, "I'm not here today to clarify this. I want to go home, will you allow me to?" Feng Sheng said, "Go home! This is impossible." Zhu Zhai said, "You can trust me, this time I'm going home to be safe and keep myself, and I will never do anything reckless outside." Feng Sheng said, "Whether you do anything reckless outside has nothing to do with me."

### Three Swimming Pools

— Dao Xian

A nouveau riche was boasting to his friends about the three swimming pools in his new house. The friend asked him, "Why do you need three swimming pools?"

"One is cold water," the owner replied, "one is hot water, and one has no water at all."

"I can understand the cold water and the hot water," his friend said, "why do you need one without any water?"

"My friend, you don't know," the nouveau riche said sadly, "I have so many old friends who don't know how to swim."
