### The Land Tax Revenue is Fully Allocated to Local Authorities; Supplementary Implementation Rules for Curbing the Hoarding and Profiteering of Daily Necessities Will Be Formulated Separately: Two Important Cases Resolved at Yesterday's Political Affairs Meeting

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] The method of dividing central and local finances for the first half of the 37th year was passed at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 6th, and it can be implemented after it is passed at the State Council meeting. It is learned that in order to enrich local finances, the central government has decided to increase local tax revenues. In the 36th year, all business tax revenue was allocated to local authorities, and now it has been decided that all land tax revenue will also be allocated to local authorities.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] After the government adopted comprehensive control over current finances and finance, the implementation of financial management was carried out first, followed by the control of cotton yarn and cloth. Now, it is further expanding to the control of daily necessities for people's livelihood, so that prices can be suppressed and currency values ​​stabilized. It is learned that this method was formulated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, entitled "Measures for Curbing the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Essential Goods for People's Livelihood." After discussion at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 6th, the political committee members all agreed that the "Measures for Curbing the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times," promulgated in February of the 30th year of the Republic of China, already had complete regulations and that there was no need to formulate new laws separately and could save the legislative procedure and formalities. Subsequently, it was resolved that the currently drafted proposal would be cancelled, and the method of the extraordinary period in Sichuan (full text published on page 2) would still be used to formulate implementation rules, which would then be sent to the Executive Yuan for review.

### Regarding the Postal and Telecommunications Price Increase Case, the Executive Yuan Reports the Resolutions of the State Council

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Regarding the postal and telecommunications price increase, after it was previously passed by the State Council, the Legislative Yuan suggested to the State Council that the Executive Yuan be instructed to promptly submit the postal and telecommunications price increase case to the Legislative Yuan for review. The National Government then handed it over to the Legal System Review Committee for review. According to the report: "The State Council is the highest state organ of the National Government according to law and has the power to formulate legislative principles. According to past precedents, the State Council has amended legal provisions by resolution and executed them first. The commission believes that the government committee, in accordance with Article 16 of the National Government Organization Law, is currently the highest state organ of the National Government, and the precedents are as mentioned above. Therefore, the State Council should be considered to have the power to make expedient decisions, and the resolution of its 16th meeting regarding the postal and telecommunications price increase case should be considered legal and effective." This was submitted to the 18th State Council meeting for a resolution, "Passed according to the review opinions, and instructed the Executive Yuan to submit the postal and telecommunications price increase case to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures." Orders were issued to the executive and legislative branches. The Executive Yuan submitted a report at its 37th meeting on the 6th and sent it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures.

### Constructing Postal Routes in the Northwest and Urgent Repairs of Provincial Highways: The Political Affairs Meeting Approves the Allocation of Huge Sums of Money

[Correspondent Report from Nanjing, 6th] The plan to construct postal routes in the Northwest was approved at the Political Affairs Meeting on the morning of the 6th, and it was decided to allocate 18.47 billion yuan as the initial funds to build the Lanzhou-Dihua Line, the Lanzhou-Ningxia Line, and the Guanzhong-Xi'an Line. According to the Ministry of Transportation's plan for the construction of postal routes in the Northwest, which was formulated in accordance with the outline of the first phase of construction plan in the Northwest region, the Northwest postal automobile route construction plan is divided into four lines: (A) Lanzhou to Dihua Line, (B) Lanzhou to Ningxia Line, (C) Ningxia to Baotou Line, (D) Lanzhou to Xining Line, with a total length of 3.406 kilometers. The Lanzhou-Dihua Line is the main artery of postal transportation in the Northwest, and it has been gradually and strenuously promoted and completed. The Ningxia Provincial Government has repeatedly requested the opening of automobile services on the Lanzhou-Ningxia Line. Secondly, the Ningxia-Baotou and Ningxia-Xining Lines, one is to connect North China and the Northwest, and the other is to connect the provincial capitals of the two provinces. However, they have no economic value to the postal service, but in order to develop the frontier postal routes, they are still being strenuously repaired. The estimated budget is 13.97 billion yuan for the Lanzhou-Dihua Line, 3.7 billion yuan for the Lanzhou-Ningxia Line, 4.53 billion yuan for the Ningxia-Baotou Line, and 800 million yuan for the Lanzhou-Xining Line, totaling 23 billion yuan. It has now been decided to postpone the Ningxia-Baotou Line, so the allocation of funds has been reduced to 18.47 billion yuan.

[Another Dispatch] In order to meet the needs of suppressing bandits and striving for military victory, the Shanxi authorities plan to urgently repair the Taiyuan-Fenlin, Taiyuan-Ningxia, and Taiyuan-Lanzhou three highways, and submitted the engineering plan and budget to the Executive Yuan.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] In view of the recent successive surges in cotton yarn and food prices, which are leading the price increases, the All-China Economic Council (全經會) Secretariat has studied the underlying causes. After layer-by-layer analysis, the impact of production, processing, transportation, and sales on commodity prices has been assessed.

### Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Yuan, Returns to Beijing: Speaks Freely About the General Situation in the United States

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Zhang Yuan, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at about 1:00 PM on the 6th. Mrs. Zhang and Wang Defang, Wei Xuezhi, and Zhou Shukai, secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all went to the station to greet him. After Zhang met with Foreign Minister Wang at the ministry, he returned to his residence to rest. His health has greatly improved, and he will start working again in the next few days. According to what he told our reporter, when he left the United States to return to China, the concern of the American government and public about the overall situation was becoming increasingly tense. At this time, Congress has resumed its sessions, and the situation is thought to be even more heated. Many discussions are expected on international and domestic issues. Although commodity prices in the United States are said to be higher than before, the average income of the people can still meet their needs for food and clothing, and the standard of living has not declined. It can be said that they have enough resources, and the problem of commodity prices is not enough to affect the decision-making of major issues. Regarding the attitude of the United States toward China, in general, they are very friendly. The amount of aid to China announced by Marshall and the plans that have been drafted were all actively proposed by the US government and supported by influential members of both houses of Congress. If there is more understanding of the current situation in our country, the result that all parties unanimously hope for will not be difficult to obtain. Zhang praised the achievements of overseas Chinese in the United States, Hawaii, and the Philippines. The performance of their business talents has been praised by Chinese and foreigners alike. It is reported that Zhang accompanied Foreign Minister Wang to the United States to attend the UN General Assembly, and then stayed in the United States for medical treatment due to a tooth ailment. He recently returned to China on the "Meiqi" ship.

### Surveying of the Yunnan-Burma Border Begins

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 6th] A group from the Boundary Survey Team of the Ministry of Interior, led by Director Chuan Si of the Topography Department, is heading to the Yunnan-Burma border to conduct on-site surveying. After several days of preparation, everything is ready. At 8:00 AM this morning, they set off in two teams, one heading south and the other heading north, to work in nine counties: Longling, Gengma, Zhenkang, Luxi, Ruili, Longchuan, Yingjiang, Lianshan, and Tengchong, and will also go to areas such as Gaoliangpo and Songnanshan. Director Chuan Si originally planned to lead the team in person, but due to important official duties in the capital, he is currently staying in Kunming to wait for a flight back to Beijing.

### There is No Secret Agreement Among the Three Powers on Handling the Japanese Reparations Issue, Says US State Department Spokesperson

[United Press, Washington, 5th] At a press briefing today, a State Department spokesperson was asked about a letter from Republican Senator Knowland to Under Secretary of State Lovett yesterday, requesting clarification on whether there was a secret agreement among the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union allowing the Soviet Union to obtain a large amount of Japanese factory equipment. What is the government's opinion? The spokesperson replied, "Absolutely not," and said that the Soviet Union has no share in the 30% of Japanese machinery designated as initial reparations. Regarding the issue of distributing Japanese reparations, the United States has proposed several plans in the Eleven-Nation Far Eastern Commission, but no resolution has been reached. Every time the United States proposes a plan, it is opposed by the Soviet representative. The United States maintains that the distribution of Japanese reparations should be based on the extent of contribution and the magnitude of losses in defeating Japan. To date, the US policy on this issue can be found in the instructions issued to MacArthur.

### The First Batch of Japanese Reparation Machinery, More Than 6,000 Units, is About to be Shipped

[Central News Agency] The initial total number of machines to be received by our country as Japanese reparation goods was 9,447 units. Due to the need to balance the value and grade of the machines received by the various Allied countries, it has been repeatedly adjusted, and finally revised to 9,398 units. The first batch of 6,544 units will be received first, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched the "Hai Kang" and "Hai Zhe" ships to sail to Japan to load them. When experts from the驻日赔偿及归还物资接收委员会 (Commission for Receiving Reparations and Returned Materials Stationed in Japan) inspected these machines, the Tokyo area was found to be the worst, while the Nagoya and Nagasaki areas were found to be the best in average quality. Therefore, the machines to be received first this time are mainly from the Nagoya Army Arsenal and the Chigusa Manufacturing Plant, followed by the Nagasaki, Kawatana Naval Factory, and the 21st Naval Air Factory.

[Our Taipei Correspondent, 6th] The "Hai Zhe" ship is scheduled to leave Keelung on the 8th and sail to Shanghai to transfer to Japan to transport reparation goods.

### Regarding the Residents of Kowloon Walled City Being Forced to Move, Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges a Protest, Demanding that the Hong Kong Government Stop Coercive Measures

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Shi Zhaoying, Acting Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on the evening of the 6th: Regarding the residents of Kowloon Walled City being forced to demolish their houses and move, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a protest with the British Embassy in China on the 6th and requested the British Ambassador to immediately cable the Hong Kong government to stop all coercive measures.

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Lapochel, a counselor at the British Embassy, said, "The Kowloon incident is only a local administrative issue for the Hong Kong government." The relocation of residents is nothing more than for public health and fire prevention. According to unconfirmed reports, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send a new representative to Hong Kong, as the representatives previously sent have been rejected by the Hong Kong authorities.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 6th] The Hong Kong government completed the work of demolishing thatched and wooden houses in the old urban area of Kowloon on Saturday morning. No more accidents occurred. Two Chinese who were arrested yesterday when the demolition began have been charged in the Kowloon Court with inciting the public and disobeying police orders. Both defendants have been remanded in custody.

### Participating in Discussions on Aid to China Plans: Bei Zuyi Flies to the United States Tomorrow, Yu Dawei Postpones His Trip Due to His Mother's Illness

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Yu Dawei and Bei Zuyi, the two technical advisors from our country invited to the United States, are still collecting materials from various relevant parties in Beijing in preparation for their trip to the United States. According to sources close to Bei, because this mission is extremely important and the trip is suddenly approaching, they have to carefully obtain sufficient information from the relevant parties, especially contact with the financial community. He almost spent the whole day meeting with Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank. According to authoritative sources, the plans for the use of US loans submitted by our country will still be based on the principles of stabilizing finances and suppressing prices. Bei has now decided to take the China National Aviation Corporation's Sino-US flight from Shanghai on the 8th to the United States. Bei is only taking one attendant, Chen Changtong, the current manager of the International Department of the Bank of China. Chen is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on the morning of the 7th to assist Bei in preparing materials and will rush back to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 7th. Yu Dawei paid another visit to President Chiang at 8:30 AM on the 6th to ask for instructions. He was originally scheduled to travel with Bei, but because his mother is ill in the Central Hospital in Beijing, Yu is visiting and caring for her at any time, so his trip has been postponed.

### The Total Amount of Aid to China Funds May be 500 Million US Dollars

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Well-informed sources say: The total amount of the planned long-term US aid to China plan will reach 700 million US dollars, but several independent items in this figure will undoubtedly be greatly reduced. They indicated that the State Department may finally propose a figure of 500 million US dollars.

On the 6th, there were signs indicating that the drafting of the aid to China plan will officially begin in mid-January. US officials who have returned to the Far East, such as former Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, have received instructions from Marshall to go to Washington for consultation and should arrive before January 10. Currently, several departments are drafting the details of the aid to China. The general outlook in Washington is that the details will be merged and proposed at various meetings to be held on January 12 and then revised.

### The Use of 18 Million US Dollars in Loans is Being Discussed in Detail

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th, United Press] It is reported that State Department experts and Chinese officials will formulate detailed rules for the use of the US$18 million in emergency aid to China during this congressional session. The outcome of the consultations is expected to make concrete decisions on the types of supplies to be provided under this line of credit and will determine the accurate comparison of various supplies. Only two items have been determined under the emergency plan so far: food and fertilizer. If China cannot obtain sufficient food from the United States within the three-month period of the above-mentioned plan, the shortage is expected to include oil and cotton. China has obtained a rice allocation of 58,000 tons in the first six months of this year, so it is expected that part of the emergency aid funds will be used to pay for half of the above-mentioned rice. According to well-informed sources, State Department officials are also preparing detailed measures for a 15-month long-term aid plan, which is said to require more than 300 million US dollars.

### Guangzhou Cracks Down on Illegal Underground Banks; Illegal Underground Banks in Hankou are Still Trying to Struggle

[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 6th] In order to strictly control the market, the Guangzhou Financial Management Bureau has decided to crack down on underground banks that have not been legally registered in the near future and has ordered all banks and financial institutions in the city to submit daily statements on a daily basis starting from the 5th for verification. Also, the financial market in Guangzhou has been relatively stable recently. The Hong Kong dollar has been hovering around 27,000, and gold has been around 8.4 million.

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 6th] Regarding the crackdown on illegal underground banks in Hankou, after the Financial Management Bureau resolutely implemented it, the authorities severely stopped the coercive actions taken by the industry.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of National Defense executed an officer, Liu Leshan, by firing squad today for embezzling military pay. Liu was from Yishui County, Shandong Province, and was 28 years old. He was a captain in the Ministry of National Defense. In March of last year, he privately sold more than 200 catties of staple food rice received by his group for February, along with more than 30 catties of five bags of flour received in March, and falsely reported and embezzled hundreds of thousands of yuan in salaries and allowances for all levels of personnel in the group.

### Barbershops in the Capital Closed; The Issue of Requesting a Price Increase Has Not Yet Been Resolved

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Millions of citizens in the capital had no haircuts on the 6th because barbers went on strike to demand a price increase. All barbershops were closed. Those who did not close were blamed by their peers and were even vandalized. Barbershop owners and barbers demanded a 150% increase in haircut prices. They went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition on the morning of the 5th without success. They went on strike on the same day. Starting on the morning of the 6th, all barbershops in the city were closed. Only a few barbershops in extremely remote areas were still open. More than 200 barbershop owners and barbers went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition again. The bureau planned to submit the matter to the deliberation meeting to be held on the 8th for discussion. The petitioners insisted that the price increase must be made on the 6th. The commotion did not end until the afternoon. It is not yet determined whether they will resume business on the morning of the 7th.

### Zhang Zhizhong Talks About the Xinjiang Issue; The Government Decides to Invite Ahmatjan to Beijing or, If Not, Negotiate Nearby in Dihua

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] The government has decided to invite Ahmatjan to Beijing to discuss the solution to the Xinjiang issue, or, if he does not come to Beijing, negotiate nearby in Dihua. This is what General Zhang Zhizhong said when he met with our reporter on the 6th. Zhang said: The date of his return to Xinjiang has not yet been determined. He is currently waiting for a letter from Yining to find out if Ahmatjan has accepted the government's invitation to come to Beijing for talks. Zhang believes that the Xinjiang issue is not serious, and the election of a provincial governor is not a problem in principle, but the election procedures and methods are still to be formulated and announced by the central government before they can be followed. Zhang said: The county magistrates and commissioners of Xinjiang Province have already been elected by the people, so the election of the governor should not be difficult. As for the time of its realization, it is still difficult to determine. It is speculated that it will be after March. The reporter asked again whether it was true that Burhan Shahidi, a member of the government committee, might return to Xinjiang to run for governor. Zhang smiled and said: This matter will depend on the voters of Xinjiang Province. Also, Zhang had an audience with President Chiang a few days ago. The reporter specifically asked whether the president had recently given any instructions on the Xinjiang issue. He replied, no.

### The Soviet Union's Proposal for a Peace Conference Has Not Yet Been Responded to by the United States; The British Government Maintains its Original Stance

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] The US State Department today received a copy of the Soviet Union's reply to China. The Soviet Union's reply suggests that countries participating in the Far Eastern Commission should attend the proposed preparatory peace conference with Japan in a limited manner. The preparatory peace conference should also be held in China this month. The State Department is still studying the Soviet Union's note and will not express its attitude on the issue recently. The British government's opinion has been clearly stated in the notes sent to the Chinese and Soviet governments on December 12 of last year.

### On the Coasts of Tianjin, Yantai, Dalian and Other Small Ports, Ghost Ship Fleets are Busy Sailing at Night; The Goods They Carry Cannot Yet Be Known

[United Press, This City] A Chinese authority said on the 5th: Between the ports controlled by the Soviet Union in the Northeast and the small ports on the coasts of Yantai, Tianjin, and North China, ghost ship fleets travel every night, carrying goods. It cannot be proven whether these ships are controlled by the Soviet Union, and the government cannot know what they are carrying. The ships are all locally made, most of them are huge, and some can carry 10,000 tons of cargo. They are fully loaded when traveling back and forth. Because of the many islands along the way, they can travel back and forth secretly at night. "They always sail at night, and we don't know what they are carrying, but we know for sure that they often dock at various points on the coast of North China, and we also know that there is no space in the cabins on the return trip." It is believed that this fleet is transporting soybeans, cotton, coal, and tungsten filaments left behind by the Japanese from North China. As for what is being transported from Dalian and Lushun, the Chinese government admits that it is unclear. "We have no way of knowing or proving whether the Soviet Union is supplying the Chinese Communists, but we know for sure that the traffic between the coast of North China and Dalian is very busy." Once, a huge ship in the fleet was painted with the UN symbol, but Chinese intelligence believed that it was completely fake. It is believed that the authority does not believe reports that the Chinese Communists and the Soviet Union held a meeting in northern Northeast China to discuss the Soviet Union supplying the Chinese Communists with weapons. The government believes that the Soviet Union would not publicly violate the 1945 Moscow Agreement, but secretly assisting the Chinese Communists is another matter. As long as the Soviet Union does not publicly take any action, the Chinese government feels helpless to deal with it, unless there is solid evidence. Even if the United Nations is asked to investigate, it would be a waste of effort. If the Chinese Navy or coastal artillery units take direct action, the Soviet Union's reaction would be very strong. The Chinese government is trying its best to avoid accidents and avoid causing another world war. China remembers the lesson of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident.

### Factories in Dalian and Lushun Manufacture Military Equipment; The Soviet Union Trains Communist Troops in Northeast China

[United Press, This City] It is reported that four senior Chinese government officials went to Dalian and Lushun last year to inspect the area. After they returned, they reported that the ordnance factories in the area were manufacturing Japanese-style weapons and ammunition. The Ministry of National Defense has not yet revealed a word of the report, but authoritative sources said that the government investigation team was led by General Yan Ping and was under strict Soviet surveillance in Dalian and Lushun and was not allowed to enter the factories. However, because the investigation team was on the scene, it obtained confirmation that the factories were in operation at the time. The Japanese used the above-mentioned factories during the war to supply their Kwantung Army. The investigation team also said that it had obtained sufficient evidence that the Chinese Communists were being trained by the Soviet Union in the area. Chinese intelligence said that the factories are still in operation. The main points of the report of the Chinese investigation team are as follows: "All the factories previously known to be ammunition factories and the centers for training the Chinese Communist troops are prohibited from inspection by the Soviet authorities. All the Communist troops in the area have newly made Japanese-style military equipment, and their training is purely Soviet-style. From the outside, if there are no uniforms, it is almost impossible to distinguish between the Chinese Communist puppet army and the Mongolian army."

### Soviet Radio Denies Military Assistance to the Chinese Communists

[This Newspaper] London, Broadcasting on the 6th: Moscow Radio broadcast that Xu Qiming, Chief of Staff of the Northern China Headquarters of the Kuomintang, recently said that the Soviet Union had supplied the Chinese Communists in the Northeast with weapons, ammunition, and military advisors. TASS has now been authorized to deny this.

### Hubei Troops Recapture Hao Xue, Bandits Invading Shayang Also Repelled by National Army

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The bandit Liu's Jianghan Independent Brigade, led by Luo Houfu, invaded Hao Xue. On the 5th, they were crushed by our local troops, and Hao Xue has been recovered. More than a thousand bandits invading Shayang were also crushed by the National Army.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 6th] Executive Headquarters News: Mianyang, which was once recovered, has recently been invaded again by bandit troops.

[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 5th] The Da Shi Qiao station south of Xuchang on the Pinghan Railway was invaded by Chen Yi's bandit troops on the 4th. The National Army stationed in Xuchang went south to attack and is currently surrounding them. The engineering train for the Pinghan Railway repair project returned to Zhengzhou. [Another Dispatch, 6th] The situation in Xuchang was unclear on the 6th. A small number of remnant bandits were discovered in Xuchang and Xinzheng. [Our Dispatch, 6th] The remnant troops of Chen Yi in the Hao County area between Anhui and Henan are being encircled and suppressed by the National Army, their territory is shrinking and they are in dire straits. Chen Yi recently convened a cadre meeting and decided to plow up the wheat seedlings in the fields to cut off the livelihood of the farmers.

Editorial

### The Opening of the 80th United States Congress—The American Government and People Will Assume an Honorable Responsibility to the World

The Eightieth Congress of the United States opens today. President Truman will send a message to Congress outlining a systematic plan regarding several serious problems currently facing Britain, such as preventing inflation, providing long-term aid for European economic recovery, and assisting China in its recovery and national reconstruction. It is expected that the U.S. Congress will engage in heated debates on these issues.

Looking ahead to 1948, we believe it will be a year of major decisions, both for American domestic affairs and for the overall world situation, and the direction of these decisions can largely be seen from the Eighth Congress which opens today. Regarding American domestic affairs, the presidential election will be held within this year, and the rivalry between the Democratic and Republican parties is gradually intensifying. Although both parties have a consensus on foreign policy, they still differ on the urgency and importance of various issues. In particular, there are major differences in opinion between the two parties on how to prevent inflation and avoid domestic economic panic, which have almost become the main themes of the two parties' election campaigns. The outcome of the upcoming election will have a significant impact on the future direction of American domestic and foreign policy. Regarding the overall world situation, since the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference ended unhappily last year, the prospects for world peace seem to have become increasingly bleak. And at the opening of the Small Assembly the day before yesterday, representatives of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries unanimously refused to attend. Although the American representative Austin still called for Soviet cooperation and guaranteed that the Small Assembly would not weaken the authority of the Security Council, whether the United Nations can be an effective organization for maintaining world peace is indeed a major question. How the United States will deal with the current world problems is not only being considered by the American government and people but is also of the utmost concern to people all over the world. This time, the U.S. Congress will discuss these pressing issues and will also make all necessary decisions on behalf of 140 million people, which naturally deserves our close attention.

The United States is a capitalist country, but it is also a country that practices democratic politics. On the one hand, the United States is blessed by nature, allowing its capitalist production to develop to a peak, but it is still seeking further progress. On the other hand, the United States represents the most prevalent democratic ideals of liberalism and fears that the world after World War II will still be dominated by other totalitarian forces, so it is constantly seeking to provide a strong guarantee for world peace. Because the foundation of American development is based on world peace and economic prosperity, it is impossible for the United States to enjoy peace alone in a world of turmoil, and it is impossible for the United States to be prosperous while the world is poor. Historical facts can prove this, and future developments also have signs that can be known. Today, there is no foothold for isolationists in the United States; what their government and people seek day and night is not the self-interest of the United States, nor the exclusive enjoyment of peace and wealth by the United States, but world peace and prosperity. Similarly, what the American government and people worry about day and night is not so much the expansion of Soviet influence or the leaking of atomic secrets, but rather the economic panic that may occur in the United States. The foreign policy of the United States after the war is based on world peace and international cooperation. To put it nicely, it is not without compassion and concern for humanity; to put it bluntly, half of it really contains motives for self-preservation and self-salvation. America's anxiety lies in America's inherent worries. Even President Truman himself said that if American inflation cannot be stopped in time, an economic panic is bound to occur within this year. Therefore, the American government, whether in domestic or foreign affairs, will adhere to this as a criterion in the future. In domestic affairs, President Truman advocates controlling wages and prices and restoring the wartime rationing system; in foreign affairs, he plans to implement a comprehensive foreign aid plan. The so-called foreign aid in his mind, in a positive aspect, is to assist European and Asian countries in their recovery and reconstruction, and in a negative aspect, to ensure that European and Asian countries do not experience economic panic to avoid affecting the American economy. To put it more clearly, if the United States wants to maintain its wartime saturated production boom after the war, it must find ways to ensure that the poor countries in Europe and Asia are free from hunger and have surplus capacity to purchase American exports. Otherwise, if all countries lack "dollars," how can American industry continue to prosper?

In the year 1947, we have indeed seen the American government take big strides towards this goal of foreign aid. The Truman Doctrine of assisting Greece and Turkey and the Marshall Plan for emergency aid to Europe have been implemented one after another, which can be said to be an enlightened plan for America to save others and save itself. However, these plans were still in the initial stages last year and were limited to one corner of Europe, neglecting Asia, which is sufficient to constitute a source of world turmoil. Not only has the aid plan to China been delayed, but also the Truman Doctrine, which takes anti-communism as its backbone, has not been extended to Asia, causing the 450 million people standing on the front line of opposing communist totalitarian politics to deeply feel doubts about the unity of American policy. At this time when Congress is about to open and discuss the issue of aid to China, according to reports from Reuters and the Associated Press, President Truman's message will propose a three-billion-dollar aid plan to China. What the content will be is still unknown as of this writing, but according to the preparations of our government, it has dispatched Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei and former Governor of the Central Bank Bei Zuyi to Washington to provide the U.S. Congress with information on the general situation of our country's finance, economy, transportation, and military, and to be available for consultation by U.S. congressmen at any time. It can be seen that the focus of U.S. aid to China will be to assist us in improving the economy and domestic transportation construction.

The general American public has always had a considerable understanding of the importance of China's position in the Far East after the war, especially President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, who know that to maintain peace in the Far East, there must be a strong, unified, peaceful, and democratic China. However, there are also a few people who do not clearly understand the seriousness of the situation in the Far East, ignore the importance of China's position in the Far East, and occasionally make unrealistic remarks, hindering the implementation of the American aid plan to China. Because the United States is a very democratic country, the American Communist Party can easily speak for the "Chinese Communist Party" to confuse the views of the general American public. Therefore, as the U.S. Congress is about to open and discuss the issue of aid to China, we sincerely ask the members of the U.S. Congress and the national government and people to calmly think about what the world has become after the war and what the situation in the Far East is today.

The World War has been over for more than two years, but the peace treaty with the main enemy countries has not yet been signed, or even drafted. What a strange phenomenon this is! Lake Success is the auspicious place for the founding of the United Nations, but the United Nations conference seems to be getting farther and farther away from the road to "success." What a strange phenomenon this is! Although the Sino-Soviet Treaty was signed in Moscow more than two years ago, the National Government still cannot peacefully and smoothly take over the entire Northeast because the communist bandits have the backing of external forces. In the flames of war in the Northeast, there are Japanese, Koreans, Mongolians... and others helping the communist bandits. What a strange phenomenon this is! The United States was the arsenal of the world's democratic countries during the Anti-Japanese War, and now, in this time of peace, it should be the great protector of the world's democratic countries. In short, in this struggle between two forces, democracy and totalitarianism, construction and destruction, humanity and anti-humanity, no matter in any region of the world—in Europe or in China—the United States today has an honorable responsibility to step forward and not shirk its duty. We believe that the current session of the U.S. Congress discussing aid plans to Europe and China is the best opportunity for the American government and people to show that they are shouldering their honorable responsibility.

We should no longer say 'my child' or 'your child,' but should say 'our child.' The children of every country in the world are all of ours. The hope for future world peace rests on the children of today. We need a next generation of human beings who are physically strong, morally sound, and intellectually capable, so that they can shoulder the responsibilities they should fulfill in the future. The United Nations Children's Relief Fundraising Movement now gives us all an equal opportunity to participate in this great work. I am especially pleased to accept the position of Chairwoman of the China region of the Relief Movement. This matter requires the concerted efforts of all our compatriots.

He said that removing these words can avoid the pretext of critics without affecting the actual effect of the bill.

### French Cabinet Wins Congressional Confidence; Tax Collection and New Economic Plan Finally Passed; All Amendments Unanimously Rejected

[Reuters Paris 5th dispatch] The Schumann cabinet, which has been in power for six weeks, has already defeated the Communist Party and extreme right-wing members of Congress. After winning five votes of confidence, it then passed a new plan to save the franc with 315 votes to 268, stipulating the collection of a special tax of 12.5 million francs.

In the voting on the various votes of confidence, the government won a majority of at most 39 votes and at least 32 votes.

### Japanese Political Situation is Turbulent; Katayama's Delayed Fate Will Depend on the Socialist Party Congress; The Pan-Agricultural Faction's Party Formation Movement Encounters Resistance for the First Time

[New Asia Agency Tokyo 6th dispatch] The Japanese political situation is currently centered on the compilation of the annual budget, the issue of the reorganization of former Agriculture Minister Hirano, and the Socialist Party Congress to be held on the 16th, and is becoming more proactive. After the closing of the first Congress last year, the Katayama cabinet, on the one hand, established the Coal National Management Bill centered on the Democratic Party case through personal negotiations between Nishiwei and Foreign Minister Ashida, making the relationship between the Social Democratic and Democratic parties superficially tend to reconciliation. However, on the other hand, the so-called "Economic Stabilization Headquarters Case" promoted by Wada as the center contradicted Katayama's opinion on the point of the 1,800-yen standard wage. As a result, when deciding on the successor to Agriculture Minister Hirano, the National Cooperative Party opposed it, and Nakayama Nomizo succeeded, causing the Socialist Party's left wing to take the position of the opposition party within the party and deepen its adverse environment. Although Katayama emphasized that the cabinet would not change in the slightest before the reconciliation conference, the actual shake-up had already begun. Moreover, there were external factors such as the active Conservative Labor-Farmer New Party movement, which made it necessary for Katayama to change policies, even if he did not step down. Therefore, the trend at the Socialist Party Congress to be held on the 16th is particularly noteworthy, and it can also be said to be the first hurdle that determines the fate of the Katayama cabinet.

[Central News Agency Tokyo 6th dispatch] Conservative political parties in Japan are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards former Prime Minister Hirano's appeal to organize a new party. Hirano and the fifteen right-wing elements who withdrew from the Socialist Party at the same time encountered their first adverse reaction today. Minister of Communications and concurrently President of the National Cooperative Party, Miki, said that he would not participate in Hirano's new party. Informed sources said that Hirano had consulted with the National Cooperative Party and left-wing members of the Socialist Party on the organization of the new party. Miki denied that the National Cooperative Party had any cooperation with Hirano's movement to organize the new party. The Liberal Party also adopted a wait-and-see attitude, which was obviously because Hirano's qualifications for assuming official positions had not yet been determined.

### East Jo Maintains Arrogant Demeanor Throughout Trial; Claims Aggressive Actions Were Legal

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] First-class war criminal Hideki Tojo still maintains that his actions were just and legal. The International Tribunal's four days of interrogation have failed to shake him. Tojo maintained a calm and arrogant demeanor throughout the trial.

Chief Prosecutor Keenan questioned Tojo on whether he had committed any moral or legal crimes. Tojo retorted angrily, "I believe I have not committed any crimes, and I believe that the actions I took were just and legal." Keenan further pressed, "If you were released, would you take the same actions as before with your former colleagues?" Before Tojo could answer, the court disallowed Keenan from asking the question. Tojo expressed considerable regret about making Puyi the puppet emperor of Manchukuo. He admitted that Puyi was a treacherous person and that he lacked foresight at the time. Tojo also stated that after learning of Puyi's testimony, he did not believe any of Puyi's statements. Tojo again defended the Japanese Emperor, attributing all past blame to himself. He stated that the Emperor consistently desired peace, and even when war was unavoidable, the Emperor's attitude remained the same. The Emperor reluctantly accepted the opinions of Tojo and the General Staff.

### Audition Tickets for the Tojo Trial Sell for 500 Yen Each

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] Tojo has even more appeal than Hollywood starlet Dorothy Lamour. The roughly two hundred spectator tickets for the Far East International Military Tribunal are being distributed for free by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to those who line up to request them, but they are being resold on the black market. Each ticket sells for 500 yen. The International Tribunal holds court once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for a total of six hours. The price to watch Tojo's trial is 1,000 yen, but the Japanese spectator seats are still often full.

### Substitute Senator from Jiangyin Arrested in Shanghai for Kidnapping; Unsuccessful Extortion of 5 Billion; Hostage Rescued in Wuxi; Reunion of Huang Baokun, Owner of Runfeng Rubber Factory, and Son

[Reported by this newspaper] Huang Baokun, 34 years old, the owner of the Runfeng Rubber Factory at No. 44, Lane 22, Changning Branch Road (i.e., Kangbianli), a native of Jiangyin, lived in the factory. His eldest son, Desheng, 7 years old, was a student in the second grade at Mige Elementary School in Caojia Wujiaochang. He was exceptionally intelligent, and his teachers favored him. On November 29th of last year, at 3:00 PM, after Desheng returned home from school, he was loitering at the entrance of the lane when he suddenly went missing. On that day, Desheng was wearing a dark-colored knitted shirt over a blue velvet vest and work pants. After the family discovered his disappearance, they sent people out in all directions to search for him, but to no avail. That evening, they reported the information to the Jiangning Police Branch Bureau. Unbeknownst to them, Desheng had already been kidnapped by bandits. That evening, they received an anonymous letter from the kidnappers, stating, "Your son has accompanied us, and he is safe and sound. Although he is lightly clothed, please do not worry and try to keep him warm." The letter also urged them to keep the matter secret. After receiving the letter, Huang Baokun was extremely frightened and knew that he had been kidnapped, so he reported to the bureau again. After receiving the report, Branch Chief Wang immediately ordered Section Chief Lin De to investigate the case urgently. Thus, detectives were dispatched in all directions, but without success. Until December 1st, they received another letter from the kidnappers, bearing the name "All Officers of the Southern Jiangsu Investigation Group, Jiangnan Branch." The letter stated that they were ordered from Northern Jiangsu to work in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, but they lacked funds. They demanded 2 billion legal tender. They said that it would be difficult to prepare this amount immediately and that they could negotiate. They would notify them again in the next letter. On the 8th, another letter arrived, bearing the name "Jiangnan Advance Command Headquarters, Nanjing-Shanghai Area General Headquarters." The letter stated that they assumed the previous letter had been received and automatically reduced the price to 1 billion yuan. They arranged to meet at the Baxian Garden in Zhenjiang on the afternoon of the 11th and instructed the representative to carry a medium-sized leather bag in his hand. Their representative would hold a folded newspaper as a signal. They also instructed not to send factory employees or fellow villagers and that the number of people should not exceed three, otherwise, it would be detrimental to the hostage. After the victim sent the letter to the bureau, Section Chief Lin personally led Police Chief Li Zunzhi, Wu Dequi, police officers Xu Jintang, Zhu Enhui, and Lu Tianci on the evening of the 10th.

Travel by train to Zhenjiang

Disguised, he coordinated with the provincial police bureau to dispatch a female police officer to lie in wait in the Baxian Garden. After waiting for a long time, the bandits did not appear. On the 11th, the family received a fourth letter, stating, "We are very grateful that you sent someone to negotiate, but the number of people was too large, and it was inconvenient to negotiate. If you are sincere, you must pay 5 billion yuan in legal tender and wait at the head of the Xiannv Temple in Yangzhou, one li to the north, on the afternoon of the 15th." The police officers went to the reported location, but still found no clues. Section Chief Lin and others had no choice but to return to Shanghai and determine a new plan. On the evening of December 31st, the branch bureau suddenly learned that a fellow villager of Huang, named Bao Juxin, had recently come to Shanghai and was living in the factory. His actions were suspicious. Therefore, they ordered police officers Wang Qi, Gu Yin Xuan, and Zhang Yanxin to conduct a household registration check. They claimed that Bao had no identification and took him to the bureau for questioning. Unexpectedly, he confessed after being interrogated, admitting that he, his cousin Bao Kunru, and fellow villager Zhang Zhongyi

Three individuals planned the kidnapping.

The hostage is currently being held at Bao Kunru's home at No. 10 Taqiao Bridge in Wuxi. On New Year's Day, police officers set off and rushed to Wuxi, where they successfully rescued the hostage and arrested Bao Kunru together. According to Bao's confession, Zhang Zhongyi lived in Room 15, Sanyizhan, Rixin Street, Zhenjiang. Police officers rushed to the location, but unexpectedly, Zhang had already left that morning at 8:00 AM, leaving a letter to Bao Juxin, which roughly stated, "I have been waiting for you for three days and am very worried. I am concerned if anything has happened to the goods (referring to the hostage). I am now in a hurry to leave and will come again tomorrow." The police officers stayed in the inn for two days, but Zhang did not appear. They then went to Zhang's home on Xinmalu Road, Huxi Road, Wuxi, but he had already fled with his family. It was later learned that he had gone to Maozhuang, Xiyang Bridge, Jiangyin. They rushed to investigate and arrest him, but still came up empty. The investigating police officers then took a train back to Shanghai. Later, it was discovered that the main culprit, Bao Juxin, was formerly the chairman of the Jiangyin County Farmers' Association and a candidate for senator. Moreover, the victim, Huang Shikun, was his nephew. Because he failed in business in Wuhu last winter and incurred losses, they secretly discussed the plan twice. The secret discussions took place in Anhui Xuan City in mid-September of last year and in Wuxi Park. It was not until November 29th that they began to carry out the kidnapping. In addition to him, Bao Kunru and Zhang Zhongyi were also present at the time. He identified the young hostage, and then Zhang stepped forward and falsely claimed that his parents were watching a movie and had asked him to pick him up. Desheng did not suspect anything and took a rickshaw to Zhenru, then a train to Nanxiang, where they stayed for two days, and then took him to Bao Kunru's home in the countryside of Wuxi. He then went to the Suzhou Beiju and stayed in the Nanyang Hotel for a few days before going to Wuxi. Later, because the situation was urgent, he came to Shanghai to inquire about the news, which led to his arrest. The police bureau is currently pursuing the escaped Zhang.

### Unite and Cooperate with Fellow Professionals; China Publishing Association Holds Inaugural Meeting

[Reported by this newspaper] The China Publishing Association held its inaugural meeting at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 representatives from various bookstores, including Commercial Press, Chung Hwa, World Book Company, Datong, Zhengzhong, and Kaiming, attended. Mayor Wu, Chairman Fang, and Director of Education Li Ximou also attended. The presidium consisted of 17 people, including Zhu Jingnong, Tao Baichuan, Li Shihui, Lin Susu, Yu Wen, Ye Zhong, Pan Gongzhan, Liu Baimen, Ji Xu, Yin Weilian, Li Hongqiu, Zhang Che, Zhang Yiqu, Xu Weinan, and Li Bojia. Pan Gongzhan was publicly elected as the chairman.

Concentrate Efforts to Contribute to the Country

At the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Pan delivered a speech, stating: The Publishing Association has been preparing for several months, and it is now established. We should jointly review our past work and hope that in the future, we can achieve the effect of "collaboration" and work together with one heart. The cultural undertaking should make contributions to the country and the nation. Taking publishing raw material paper as an example, the quality of domestic paper is poor and the quantity is small. Most of the paper used for publishing relies on foreign goods. The preciousness of paper can be seen, and if it is not used properly, wouldn't it be a waste of foreign exchange? At present, world peace has not yet been established, the international situation is turbulent, and domestic wars are frequent. The publishing industry should be vigilant. The chairman clearly announced in his New Year's Day broadcast that the communist rebellion is a domestic rebellion with foreign involvement, and suppressing the rebellion and suppressing the communists is the spearhead of resisting future foreign aggression. The publishing industry and the cultural world should be the beacon of the people, so that the country and the nation do not go astray. It is hoped that all colleagues in the publishing industry will concentrate human resources, material resources, and intellectual power, unite as one, and make contributions to the country and the nation, and to suppressing the rebellion and quelling the chaos.

Encourage Colleagues to Eliminate Bad Elements

Chairman Fang of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee then delivered a speech, stating that publishing and culture are the spiritual food of mankind. As an example, he said that he lived in a small village on the border of Hunan and Guizhou for two days during the Anti-Japanese War. There were only four families in the village, and there were no books or newspapers available for reading, which was extremely depressing. Later, he found a remnant page of the Shenbao from more than ten years ago, which contained several short articles. He read it again and again and cherished it as a treasure. This is enough to prove the importance of the publishing industry. The communists destroy the five relationships, massacre intellectuals, and destroy culture. The Publishing Association should severely attack them and protect culture. At the same time, colleagues should encourage each other and eliminate bad elements, etc. After this

The number of conscripts has generally increased compared to last year. The situation in Shanghai is more special. Last year, the conscription work adopted a method of enlisting volunteers, which was completed as scheduled. However, this method revealed some drawbacks. This year's conscription work will be carried out more cautiously. The method of conscription, whether it is lottery conscription or still enlisting volunteers, will be decided after discussion between Mayor Wu and the Military Service Association. The conscription work in this city will also begin after the method has been agreed upon. As for the quota for the first phase of this year in this city, it was learned from other sources by reporters that it is double the 3,000 names last year. According to Fu's disclosure, the second phase of conscription this year will begin in the second half of the year.

### Primitive Human Life Appears in Prosperous Shanghai; Half-Naked Cave Dwellers Subsisting on Wild Food; Waiting to Be Fed in Freezing Weather

[Reported by this newspaper] The life of primitive humans living in caves and eating wild food thousands of years ago has actually appeared in the highly developed Shanghai urban area with 20th-century material enjoyment. Near the old site of the South Railway Station in Nanshi, which was destroyed by artillery fire during the war, the wounds have not yet healed. Rubbish, dung, and grass are everywhere, a desolate scene. Recently, one or two hundred refugees from other places have gathered there. Except for a part of them who have built low-lying shacks with turf and mud to shield themselves from the wind and rain, most of the refugees dig holes in the ground and live in them at the original location of the station platform.

The remains of the platform have now disappeared, leaving only uneven mounds of earth and some cement remnants. The refugees dig holes in the mounds of earth to make their homes. The size of the caves varies, with the smaller ones only able to accommodate one person and the larger ones able to accommodate two or three people. The height is only half a body, so they must crawl in and out. Inside the cave, there are only a few sparse straws, and the dampness and darkness are self-evident. If it rains, the misery

Can be imagined.

The cave-dwelling refugees are all half-naked. Most of them come from disaster areas in Anhui. After arriving in Shanghai, they were expelled by the police for begging in the urban area. Now, they can only pick up vegetable scraps and other things near their caves to fill their stomachs every day. Not long ago, some students from a certain school went to distribute some winter clothing and rice. Therefore, when they see well-dressed people passing by, they assume that they are going to distribute relief and beg bitterly, hoping that the authorities will provide relief and shelter.

### Preliminary Decision by Three-Person Group to Discuss Food Relief Allocation Prices

(Our Newspaper Report) The United States is donating 125,000 tons of relief supplies to China, including 75,000 tons of rice and 50,000 tons of flour and wheat. The first batch of 22,000 tons has already arrived in the city and the rest will arrive successively. The relief supplies are allocated to the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, and this city has established the U.S. Relief Supplies Allocation Committee to handle the matter. At 3:00 PM yesterday, Wu Kaixian, representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Ye Shifu, representative of the Ministry of Food, and Mattite, representative of the United States, held a small group meeting at the Social Bureau to discuss allocation methods. Wu Kaixian proposed a distribution plan based on the rice distribution method of the People's Food Allocation Committee, using the relief supplies to replenish the rice allocation for the poor, public educators, and professional groups. The U.S. representative agreed to the distribution principle but believed that the allocation price was slightly lower than the market price, in order to use the proceeds as a relief fund for our country's relief endeavors. Wu Kaixian stated that if the allocation price was too high, it would lose the original intention of the allocation. After exchanging opinions, regarding the allocation price, it was proposed to adopt a compromise figure based on the adjusted rice price to be decided at the People's Food Allocation Committee's regular meeting to be convened within the month, in order to imbue the relief supplies and relief endeavors with the same meaning. This draft plan will be formally decided after being submitted to the general meeting for discussion.

### More Than 10,000 Words of Non-Prosecution Document for Lou Guowei and Others to Be Published Today

Lou Guowei, the former Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau, Wang Mingyi, the chief of the First Section, and other officials of the bureau, who were accused of suspicion of corruption, have been investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Gu Ruilin of the District Procuratorate, and a decision was made not to prosecute them due to insufficient suspicion of criminal activity. The reasons for the non-prosecution are explored below: Regarding the collection of income tax for the previous year, former Director Lou Guowei adopted an auditing method and organized a review committee. After the Ministry of Finance and the District Procuratorate reviewed the committee's past records, they were found to be factual, and everything was carried out in accordance with the resolutions. As for the allegation that the committee extorted gold from businesses during audits, the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to investigate and found it to be untrue. Furthermore, the District Procuratorate's investigation also revealed that all businesses denied this matter. As for the allegation that Lou Guowei and Wang Mingyi led extravagant lives, this is a matter of private life and cannot constitute criminal punishment. Regarding the extortion of 24 gold bars from the exchange, calculated at the market price at the time, it would amount to hundreds of millions of yuan, which is obviously inconsistent with reason and lacks factual basis.

(Another Report) According to the District Procuratorate, the full text of the non-prosecution document for Lou Guowei and others is over 10,000 words long and has not yet been finalized. It has been decided to postpone the full publication until the afternoon of the 7th.

### The Municipal University: Pioneering a New Path for Social Education in Guangzhou

[Our Newspaper's Report from Guangzhou on the 4th] Guangzhou's "Municipal University" has been open for more than a month. This is not only a pioneering initiative in Guangzhou's education, but such an educational institution is probably rare in the whole country. This "university" is not like an ordinary university registered with the Ministry of Education. Its study period is only six months, and enrollment only requires registration without an examination. No bachelor's degree is granted after graduation, so although it is named a "university," its nature is really a comprehensive academic lecture series.

Promoting Social Education and Fostering a Research Ethos

The sponsor of this "university" is the Guangzhou Municipal Education Bureau. The bureau can be said to spare no effort in promoting various aspects of education. For example, the number of municipal primary and secondary schools has been restored to pre-war figures, and the number of students enrolled exceeds pre-war levels by one-third. This can be said to have achieved considerable success. At the same time, school education can also be regarded as reaching a stable stage, so in order to achieve balanced development, it has turned its attention to social education. In addition to the People's Education Center, library, museum, etc., which were established long ago, the National Sports Commission, the Broadcasting Arena, and the Cultural Education Department have also been restored or established one after another. Recently, in order to improve the intellectual level of citizens, promote social education, and foster a research ethos, it has established this "Municipal University" in accordance with the needs of the social environment.

No Colleges, No Departments, Only Twenty-Two Lecture Series

This "university" has no "colleges" and no "departments." It only has twenty-two lecture series, namely: Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings, Public Opinion, New Life, International Issues, Party and Government Issues, Constitutional Government Issues, Social Issues, Economic Issues, Health Education, Social Education, Children's Issues, Women's Issues, Youth Issues, Municipal Issues, Overseas Chinese Issues, Border Issues, Current Affairs Commentary, Chinese History, History of Chinese Culture, Outline of Foreign History, Philosophy, and Journalism. Each lecture series employs famous figures from China and abroad to be responsible for lecturing. Students can freely choose which lecture series to attend.

Classes at 7:00 PM Every Night, Evening Parties Held Every Week

As for the internal organization of the school, there is only an Education Committee. The director of the bureau, Director Zhu, serves concurrently as the chairman of the committee. The head of the Social Education Section of the Education Bureau, Guo Jinglun, and the principal of the Municipal Normal School, Ren Xueming, are all members. Their class time is from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM every night. A New Life evening party is held once a week for relaxation. There are currently more than 400 students, including out-of-school youths, civil servants, shop assistants, and people from all walks of life who generally enjoy research and learning, so their level of knowledge is naturally uneven.

If This Session Is Successful, Several More Will Definitely Be Continued

According to Director Zhu, this type of "Municipal University" organization is very popular in several countries in Europe. However, it has not been held in China before. Last year, Vice Chairman Sun of the National Government returned to Guangzhou and mentioned that when he was the mayor of Guangzhou, he planned to establish this type of "university" and instructed it to be prepared immediately. Therefore, this "Municipal University" can be said to have been established in accordance with the instructions of Vice Chairman Sun. He also said: After this news was released, there was a very enthusiastic response to registration. There are now more than 400 people, so classes have started first. In fact, there are still many people who have registered, but due to space limitations, too many people cannot be accommodated, which is a disappointment to some enthusiastic learners and a great regret! Finally, he also stated that if this session is successful, several more will definitely be continued in the future.

In today's serious education problem, if the organization of this type of "Municipal University" can be successful, it is believed that it will not only be of great help to education, but it will also have a positive impact on the overall social atmosphere to some extent.

### Why Did Qian Weiqing Borrow a Gun and Shoot Su Qing? Student Self-Destruction

[Our Newspaper's Report from Wujin on the 6th] In this county, on the night after New Year's Day, around 6:00 PM, in the dim twilight, a student shooting of a student occurred at the foot of the West Gate. This matter is quite tortuous and bizarre. The case has not yet been clarified as of the beginning of the year due to the suspension of office. The details are as follows: Su Qing, a high school student at the private Baiyi Middle School, does not study seriously at school on weekdays. It is said that he participates in some kind of organization and often attends meetings outside. On the afternoon of the 31st, he invited his classmate Yue Feng and Qian Weiqing from West Suburb Middle School in Wuxi, 18 years old, to see a movie at the West Gate Grand Theater. After the movie was over, they parted ways at the Huaide Bridge intersection. At 6:15 PM, Qian Weiqing was again invited to see Su Qing at the entrance of the Miqiao Elementary School, but he was not there. He circled around on the street and met Su Qing and Yue Feng. Then Qian accompanied Su to play at the West Gate, and Yue Feng left. Walking to the foot of the West Gate, while walking and talking, Qian Weiqing suddenly raised a handgun borrowed from Su Qing and fired a shot at Su Qing, hitting Su's lower jaw and head. Su let out a cry and fell to the ground. Qian immediately fled. Su was carried by passersby to Wujin Hospital for treatment and was still able to speak. He immediately reported the incident to the police station, which arrested Qian at West Suburb Middle School and seized a homemade handgun and four bullets. After interrogation and investigation, Qian Weiqing was suspected of premeditated murder and was sent to the city defense department for handling. However, according to Su Qing, Qian Weiqing was usually a very good friend. Qian Weiqing stated that he suddenly saw two people jumping down from the city wall in front of him at the south end of the city foot. At this time, Su Qing was walking in front, and he was very frightened by the people who jumped down, so he hurriedly took out the handgun, accidentally touched the safety, and the bullet came out, mistakenly hitting Su Qing. After the incident, he panicked and did not know what to do, so he threw it away. He usually has a very good relationship with Su, and so on. Su Qing, who was shot, has a swollen face, and the bullet has not yet been removed. One theory is that he developed murderous intentions out of jealousy. What is the actual situation is still under investigation.

### Wuxi Court Dispatches Personnel to Re-examine Rape and Murder Case; One Knife to the Throat, Head and Body Almost Severed, Jar Next to Corpse to Attempt to Destroy Evidence

[Our Newspaper's Report from Wuxi on the 5th] On the morning of December 27 last year, Cai Jinshan, a resident of Hongshengli Town in the Dangkou District of this county, was beaten to death with an iron rod because of his adultery with Wang, the wife of Zou Fuwei. After the incident, the murderers Zou Fuwei and his wife surrendered to the local police station and were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The next day, personnel were dispatched to the countryside to examine the body. The results of the examination revealed many suspicious points. This matter did not seem like adultery, and the murderer's confession was also largely inconsistent. In order to re-investigate, the District Procuratorate appointed Prosecutor Zhu Guohua to lead the forensic examiner to re-examine the body in the countryside the day before yesterday. After Zhu carefully inspected the scene of the incident and questioned the victim's family and neighbors, he discovered many suspicious points. It was obvious that it was not a case of adultery, and the murderer had the intention of destroying evidence.

Bloodstains Everywhere

The location of the crime was in Hongsheng Lane. The house had seven courtyards, each separated by a courtyard. Usually, people entered and exited through the side doors. The murderer lived in the last courtyard. The prosecutor's examination revealed bloodstains in the front courtyard of the house where Zou lived. There were also bloodstains on the walls and floor of the living room. The corpse was lying in Zou's bedroom, and a large amount of blood flowed on the ground, which had coagulated. In addition to being cut by random knives, the victim's head was also cut twice, especially deep at the throat, about three inches long, and the wound was very clean, almost separating the head from the body. There was a medium-sized water jar next to the corpse.

Husband and Wife Surrender

After the prosecutor finished the examination, he summoned Cai Hua, the wife of the deceased, and Tongju Xiaogen in the room. According to Shi, around 9:00 AM on the 27th of last month, Shi went out to soak clothes and returned home, seeing that the side door was closed. She knocked hard for about ten minutes before it opened. When she entered, she saw Zou Fuwei covered in blood, and Zou's wife, Wang, was wiping the bloodstains on the floor. Shi knew that something had happened and followed the bloodstains to the living room. Suddenly, she saw a foot of a corpse protruding from the door of Zou's room, so she ran out in horror to report to the town office. Zou also knew that he could not escape the crime, so he went out with his wife and surrendered to the police station, and so on. According to the deceased's wife, her husband had no major grudges with Zou during his lifetime, only a quarrel over trivial matters, which would not lead to murder. Also, Cai had suffered from paralysis before, but has now recovered, but his strength is still weak, and so on.

Chopping the Corpse and Moving the Corpse

After Zhu finished questioning, he continued to inspect the room and extracted the situation at the time. All the evidence was also taken to the court for storage. After Zhu returned to the city, he interrogated the detained murderers Zou Fuwei and his wife. Zou still insisted that he killed Cai in the room because of his adultery with his wife. After the prosecutor repeatedly questioned him and told him about the examination, Zou admitted that he chopped him to death in the courtyard and moved the corpse into the room, but he still insisted that the cause of death was adultery. Zou's wife, Wang, answered similarly to her husband, but claimed that she did not help him. After the interrogation, they were still detained. The truth of this case, which is bizarre and sensational throughout the county, remains to be investigated further before it can be clarified.

### Blood Case at Feilai Peak: Tea Drinker Chen Liugen Poisoned Female Hostess Tang Yuying

[Our Newspaper's Report from Hangzhou on the 5th] At around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, a blood case of murdering for money occurred in the air-raid shelter behind Feilai Peak. Tang Yuying, a female hostess from Shanghai Yong'an Company, met Chen Liugen, a tea drinker, while drinking tea. One day, Chen suddenly went to Yong'an and invited her to Hangzhou for fun. She politely refused, but Chen grabbed her collar and said that the tickets had already been bought and she had to go with him. Helplessly, she accompanied him to Hangzhou, where they stayed together at the Liangjiang Hotel for two nights. In the afternoon, Chen invited her to Lingyin Temple. At around 3:00 PM, they entered the air-raid shelter at Feilai Peak. Chen hugged her and took out a knife, stabbing her throat. She fell to the ground due to serious injuries. Chen then hit her left cheek, knocking her to the ground, and stole the cash of 3,277,000 yuan, three gold rings, a gold lock, a gold chain, and a one-tael gold bar from her purse. The police station at Lingyin Substation learned of the incident and immediately launched a search, arresting Chen on a rickshaw near Yue Tomb. Chen claimed that he and Tang were married and that his wife's death in the cave was an accident. The police station found Chen's statement suspicious and went to the scene of the incident and the Municipal Hospital to question the injured party. Only then did they learn the truth. Chen is currently being interrogated.

### Wujin Zhaizhai Town Security Squad Unsafe, Town Strike Demands Punishment of Culprits

[Our Newspaper's Report from Wujin on the 5th] Pan Zhe, the captain of the Second Squad of the Third Regiment of the County Security Forces, was stationed in Zhaizhai Town, Qianhuang District. Pan usually commanded the troops without proper method, and discipline was lax, which caused deep resentment among the people. On New Year's Day, the town had no rewards due to commercial depression and economic difficulties. The squad leader, Pan, held a grudge and, on New Year's Day, used gambling as an excuse to go to a teahouse where Pan Guozhen, the father of the deputy township chief, was settling taxes. He was beaten severely. He then went to the township office and beat Liu Shiyuan, a township official, severely. At this time, the Winter Defense Committee was holding a meeting to discuss expenses, and everyone was shocked by the situation, suspecting that the squad had mutinied and dispersing in confusion. The next day, Township Chief Qian, based on the information, reported to the district office and the regiment headquarters for handling. Unexpectedly, squad leader Pan Zhe had no remorse and instead kidnapped the deputy township chief under the pretext of inviting the township chief to talk, wandering in the wilderness all night. Upon learning of this, the district office strictly stopped them and sent a letter to the regiment headquarters. All the merchants and people of Zhaizhai Town believed that the squad was acting perversely and arbitrarily arresting civil servants. A strike began on the 3rd, and over 150 representatives were sent to the district office and county government to petition, demanding strict punishment of the squad leader. The security brigade leader, who was in Shanghai, made a long-distance phone call to mediate, promising withdrawal and punishment. The representatives then dispersed.

Li Huitang Visits Kunming, Discusses Participation in World Games Football Qualifying Round

[Our Kunming Dispatch] Although Kunming is said to be like spring all year round, the temperature has dropped since the winter solstice. According to incomplete statistics from the police, over twenty corpses of those who froze to death have been found near the city walls in recent days. Proportionally, this is a serious issue in Kunming.

Therefore, a winter relief campaign has been actively launched in Kunming. After several discussions among enthusiastic members of society and relevant authorities, it was decided to initiate a winter relief football and tennis charity match. Relying solely on local teams was deemed insufficient, so sports figures here thought of the "King of Football," Li Huitang. After numerous letters urging him to come, Li agreed, and on the 23rd, the "Air Overlord" plane brought Li Huitang and his second son, Li Yude, to Kunming.

The Excitement of the Fans
This was a great excitement for the 300,000 citizens of Kunming, especially the football fans. The sporting atmosphere in the three Yi regions has always been very low, but the arrival of the "King of Football" was like a stone thrown into a calm lake, creating waves and ripples, attracting much attention and satisfaction.

On the afternoon of the 25th, when the match began at the Zhizhou Sports Association, the crowding and excitement were probably only seen once before after a victory parade. It happened to coincide with Yunnan National Protection Memorial Day, which was a holiday, and the place was packed. Both the 20,000 and 50,000 admission tickets were sold out, and even the walls were full of spectators who didn't buy tickets, all to see the splendor of the "King of Football."

According to the charity match schedule, the Youxing team formed by the "King of Football" in Kunming will play a total of five football matches, in addition to four tennis matches. With the warm winter sun shining every day, three football matches and two tennis matches have already been played. Li Huitang's personal skills are beyond question, and although he is not as brave as he used to be, his son, Li Yude, has a "surpassing the father" feel. The Li father and son team has indeed caused a sensation throughout the mountain city. (To be continued)

Li Huitang and Son Leave Kunming for Hong Kong

[Our Kunming Office, 5th] The "King of Football," Li Huitang, and his son concluded their charity football and tennis performances in Kunming on the 5th. They played a total of seven football matches and four tennis matches, losing only one match by a small margin. The winter relief fund raised reached 600 million yuan. The Li family decided to leave Kunming for Hong Kong on the morning of the 6th.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 6th] "King of Football" Li Huitang and his son, who were invited to Kunming before Christmas to participate in the winter relief charity match, returned to Hong Kong by plane today.

Resumption of Gold Ornament Trading: Silverware Industry Association Board Meeting Prepares for Business Resumption; Social Affairs Bureau Says It Has Not Received Official Documents from the Ministry of Finance

[Our Report] The Municipal Silverware Industry Association convened a board meeting yesterday to discuss the resumption of gold ornament trading, as approved by the authorities, and to prepare for the resumption of business. The meeting aimed to calculate the percentages for legal profits, operating expenses, wages, etc. After the meeting, all board members, led by Chairman Wu Pengnian, paid a visit to Director Wu of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu stated that the bureau had not yet received official documents from the Ministry of Finance regarding the resumption of gold ornament trading, nor had the Silverware Industry Association received them. Therefore, discussions on the resumption of business seemed to lack a basis. It was decided to wait for the official documents to be issued before further discussions.

Measures to Strengthen Financial Controls to Arrive Soon

[Our Report] After the Executive Yuan approved measures to strengthen financial controls, the Financial Management Bureau drafted implementation steps and prepared various forms to be submitted to the ministry for review. As the ministry's order had not yet been approved, Deputy Director Bi Delin made a special trip to Beijing last week to seek instructions. He returned to Shanghai today and stated that the Ministry of Finance had received the Yuan's order and distributed it to various bureaus. The measures to strengthen financial controls would arrive soon. The Ministry of Finance has specific regulations for all forms. Once the bureau receives them, it will immediately notify all financial institutions to comply. The main focus of strengthening financial controls is to audit loans and remittances. Banks and financial institutions are required to submit daily reports and conduct weekly inspections to understand the movement of funds and find ways to channel them into production. Banks and financial institutions should pay special attention to whether borrowers meet the regulations when granting loans. If any violations are found, they will be dealt with according to law, and serious cases may be subject to a fine of up to 50% of their turnover.

Silver and Money Businesses Still Cannot Use Bonds to Meet Reserve Requirements

[Our Report] Regarding the payment of reserve funds by silver and money businesses, the Ministry of Finance, based on the provisions of the Banking Law and considering the current actual situation, decided to implement six measures, effective from January 1st of this year. Subsequently, it was feared that the use of government bonds to partially offset reserve requirements would cause the outflow of cash used for reserve requirements, which would have a significant impact on the market. Therefore, it was specifically ordered that item 5 be temporarily suspended. The original six measures are listed as follows:

 The reserve funds to be paid by silver and money businesses for ordinary deposits and savings deposits should be uniformly renamed "guarantee reserve funds" in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law.

 The provisional ratios for deposit guarantee reserve funds for commercial banks and savings banks in various regions are set at 15% for current deposits and 10% for time deposits.

 The ratios for deposit guarantee reserve funds for industrial banks should be determined after the business is legally adjusted and its nature is determined. Currently, they should temporarily be paid in accordance with the commercial bank standards mentioned above.

 The ratios for deposit guarantee reserve funds for provincial, county, and city banks should temporarily be handled in accordance with the industrial bank regulations in the Banking Law. The payment ratios are temporarily set at 12% for current deposits and 8% for time deposits.

 Silver and money businesses may use government bonds to offset deposit guarantee reserve funds in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law. However, the government bonds used to offset deposit guarantee funds may not exceed 50% of the total amount payable. As for the valuation of bonds, national currency bonds should be calculated at 70% of their face value, and foreign currency bonds should be calculated at 50% of the foreign exchange market price published on the date of payment or adjustment.

 The adjustment of guarantee reserve funds should still be carried out once a month, as in the past. Previously, the guarantee reserve for savings deposits was adjusted every three months, and it should be changed to once a month.

National Bonds Soar, Foreign Stocks Mediocre

Government bonds soared yesterday due to the stimulus of currency system reform. National Bond C rose from 31,200 yuan to close at 37,500 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, A and B bonds rose by 5,400 yuan, C bonds rose by 6,600 yuan, D bonds rose by 6,000 yuan, and E bonds also rose by 6,300 yuan. The transaction volume was 6 million.

Foreign stocks reported 3.1 yuan for Hong Kong Shanghai Electric Power, forming a mediocre situation, with narrow fluctuations and a lack of change. Foreign firms and securities firms had mixed activities. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Jardine Matheson paper and Carlsberg beer rose by half a percent, while Jardine Matheson textile, British and Chinese Corporation, and Wheelock Marden & Co. fell slightly. Jardine Matheson rose slightly, and the rest remained peaceful.

Goods Exported from Hong Kong Must Prove They Have Been Settled in Foreign Exchange; Includes Tung Oil, Pig Bristles, etc.

[Our Report] The Sino-Hong Kong Agreement has been implemented since January 5th of this year. According to the agreement, for tung oil, pig bristles, tea, tin, cotton yarn, and vegetable oil exported from Hong Kong to any third country, Form CBC Sa (Revised) must be provided to prove that the relevant foreign exchange for the exported goods has been settled or agreed to be settled with a designated bank. The Hong Kong government will only allow the export after verification. The Business Department of the Central Bank recently issued Circular No. 122 to all designated banks, stipulating that from now on, businesses exporting the above-mentioned goods from the country to Hong Kong must submit the above form in five copies. After being signed by the designated bank, the applicant will retain one copy, which must first be stamped by the customs tax officer at the port of export. When the goods are re-exported from Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government will use this copy for verification to allow the export.

[Our Guangzhou Office, 6th] After the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, there has been no significant reaction in the market here, and everyone is waiting for the next step from the government. According to economist Huang Yuanbin, who recently returned from the south, the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement mainly aims to prevent smuggling. However, the key to preventing smuggling lies in the excessively low exchange rate. Therefore, to prevent smuggling, the exchange rate should be adjusted first to increase exports.

Chinese Stocks Fluctuate; Yong Yarn Sees New Prices; Short Sellers Active Again

Although Yong Yarn hit new highs in the morning and afternoon yesterday, the resurgence of short sellers made the market volatile. Small stocks such as Xinyi, Jinglun, Yonggong, Yongye, NeiYi, Huaxin, and LianAn successively reached their daily price limits.

The market opened with a show of strength, with Xinyi and Jinglun both reaching their daily price limits. Yong Yarn opened at 621 yuan and 628 yuan, with loan-assisted sales, falling back to 607 yuan and 612 yuan. When Yonggong hit the daily price limit, small stocks saw renewed profit, and Yong Yarn also rose to new highs of 625 yuan and 635 yuan. The interest rate outside the market opened at 2.25 fen and 2.7 fen. Short sellers became active again, and the market closed down to 605 yuan and 612 yuan at noon. Compared to the previous close, spot stocks Xinyi and Jinglun hit their daily price limits, and Yonggong rose by half a percent after hitting its daily price limit. LianAn NeiYi rose by 10%, and Shangwu fell by half a percent. The remaining stocks and forward stocks saw only slight increases and decreases.

In the afternoon, Yong Yarn fell back to 606 yuan and 607 yuan. Except for Xinyi and Jinglun, which hit their daily price limits, Yonggong, Yongye, and NeiYi successively hit their daily price limits. Rumors of a reduction in the stamp tax reappeared, and the market rose again to 628 yuan and 633 yuan. The national banks had significant differences in their quotations, and the market softened slightly. However, the market closed back up to highs of 627 yuan and 628 yuan. LianAn hit its daily price limit near the close. Compared to the morning close, spot stocks Xinyi, Jinglun, Yonggong, Yongye, NeiYi, Huaxin, and LianAn hit their daily price limits.

Forward stocks Yonggong hit its daily price limit, Meiya rose by 10%, and Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Huafeng rose by half a percent. Yong Yarn, Xinhe, and others saw slight increases. Most of the old stocks outside the market rose by half a percent, and the rest showed strength.

Cotton Merchants Host Meeting, Request Support, Cotton Stock Registration Not Yet Completed

[Our Report] The Municipal Cotton Commercial Association believes that the government's unified purchase of raw cotton hinders the industry's survival. It will host a tea party at 2:00 PM today on the 6th floor of the China Merchants Bureau to invite members of the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, private yarn factories, economic experts, and the press to issue an urgent appeal, requesting unified support from all sectors.

Another report: The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee instructed the Cotton Commercial Association on the 27th of last month to handle the cotton stock registration, with a deadline of the 7th of this month. As of yesterday (the 6th), the association had not yet carried out the procedure. According to the person in charge of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, the association's failure to comply with the law is inappropriate. The committee will adhere to the government's established policy and take effective measures if the legal procedures are not completed by the deadline.

Various Regulations for Yarn Management Expected to be Fully Implemented by the 15th

[Our Report] Yuan Liang, chairman of the Yarn Management Committee, met with reporters yesterday and stated that since the establishment of the Yarn Management Committee, there have been no established rules to follow, and everything is of an innovative nature. Therefore, efforts are being made to make various preparations to ensure that the execution of the committee's affairs is without omission. The committee is currently continuing to convene internal directors to expedite the drafting of detailed implementation rules and procedures for the collection and transportation of raw cotton, contract spinning and weaving, and distribution. It is expected that all regulations will be finalized and passed by the first committee meeting in ten days, and will hopefully be implemented by the 15th. At the same time, the committee will submit the regulations to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. The committee currently has branch offices in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Tianjin oversees Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces. Hankou oversees Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces. Guangzhou oversees Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Fujian provinces. More branches will be added as needed in the future.

Sales Are Brisk, Inventories Are Depleted, Fine Yarn Prices Rise, Cotton Cloth Allocation Prices Fall, People's Hearts Calm Down

Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened steadily. As manufacturers on this street still had strong demand and buyers from other regions were also active, prices rose. The 42-count fine yarn was particularly active, with a significant price increase. Around 11:30 AM, the Textile and Construction Company suddenly announced its prices and accepted applications from the industry, which slightly softened people's sentiment. However, transactions continued to be brisk, and prices rose again. In the end, 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn rose by 3.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 700,000 to 1.2 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market opened with continuous replenishment by the industry and wholesalers, and buyers from other regions remained active, leading to higher prices. 12-pound Lanji fine cloth opened at 1.285 million yuan. Buyers from the north and the Yangtze River region were very active, and prices rose to 1.295 million yuan. After 10:00 AM, the number of fabrics released by the Textile and Construction Company increased compared to the previous period, and the allocation price was also lower than the market price, which immediately caused people's sentiment to calm down and buyers to wait and see. In the end, Longtou fine cloth was 1.515 million yuan, a slight increase of 20,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths showed mixed trends, with the underlying tone being weak but firm.

Silver Dollars in Private Hands; No Forced Purchase Unless High-Priced Trading

[Our Report] Regarding the forced purchase of silver dollars in private hands, the Ministry of Finance has decided that there will be no forced purchase unless there is high-priced trading. A reporter interviewed relevant personnel at the Central Bank yesterday. According to them, they have not yet received this order. The 20,000 silver dollars purchased by the city at the official price last time are still being held by the Central Bank.

Huo Baoshu Succeeds as Chairman of the Export-Import Management Committee

[Our Report] The chairman of the Export-Import Management Committee was originally held concurrently by President Zhang of the Central Bank. Recently, Mr. Zhang requested to resign due to busy affairs. His resignation has been approved, and Huo Baoshu has been appointed by the Executive Yuan to succeed as chairman. Vice Chairman Li Ming has also resigned and been approved. Another Vice Chairman, Li Gan, has also requested to resign due to a business trip to the United States. It is now known that although Zhang Jiaji and Li Ming have resigned, they will remain in their positions. The new chairman is currently in Guangdong handling personal matters and discussing important matters with Mr. Song Ziwen, and is expected to return to Shanghai to take office within a week.

Rayon Lingers at High Prices; Silk Goods Soar

The rayon market yesterday morning was similar to the previous day. 120-count Xuzi bright yarn opened at around 91.5 million yuan, fell to a low of 50 million yuan in the middle, and recovered to 100 million yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it rose again, with the final price being 4.5 million yuan, up 3 million yuan from the previous day.

Silk Goods

The silk market rose yesterday, with silk quilt covers seeing the most significant price increases. Huaqiang goods opened at around 7 million yuan in the morning, and many buyers rushed to buy, creating a situation of demand exceeding supply, leading to step-by-step price increases. The market closed at 8.2 million yuan for spot prices, with overnight arbitrage at around 400,000 yuan. Minsheng Xin satin mill was at 210,000 yuan, Yunlin flannel was at 215,000 yuan, and rayon Huajin ordinary goods had transactions at 65,000 yuan. Other goods all saw slight increases.

Cigarettes Fall

The cigarette market yesterday morning was strong due to strong demand from the industry. Around 9:00 AM, it was heard that the Yongtaihe factory announced prices that were lower than the market price. 10-piece Great Britain was 27 million yuan, Old Knife was 23 million yuan, and 20-piece Great Britain was 28 million yuan per box of 50,000 cigarettes. Therefore, buyers waited and watched, and transactions were slow in the afternoon, with prices falling. In the end, 10-piece Great Britain and Old Knife cigarettes fell by 1.7 million to 1.75 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other Chinese merchant strip cigarettes also fell slightly by 1,000 to 6,000, 7,000, and 10,000 yuan.

Rice Remains Firm, Oil Market Slightly Weakens

Yesterday, a total of more than 16,400 shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets. The north and south markets showed opposite trends. Sales in the north market were surprisingly strong, and japonica rice and early indica rice both rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Digestion in the south market remained sluggish, and medium-grade white japonica rice and early indica rice fell by more than 20,000 yuan. Indica rice generally saw little change. White silver dollars were temporarily inactive. Flour was active in the north and continued to surge by 10,000 yuan. Bingchuan rice was up more than 10,000 yuan. Wheat bran was increasingly scarce, remaining firm. Soybean cake supply was low, and the trend was stable. Soybean buyers were active, but oil mills were cautious. The market was sluggish, and the price of soybeans was stable. Du Huang was sluggish and lost its luster, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

Mung beans arrived in small quantities and rose by 10,000 yuan. Red beans had flat sales, and the price fell by 10,000 yuan. Cowpeas saw a decrease in transactions and also fell by 10,000 yuan. Broad beans had balanced arrivals and sales, and the price did not change. Red sorghum sales in the north were weak and continued to fall by 10,000 yuan.

Corn buyers in the north were not interested, and medium-grade corn fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Raw peanuts buyers were inactive, and the price stopped rising and fell sharply by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Sesame traders in Tianjin made some transactions, and many wanted to sell, causing the price to fall by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.

Free Talk: My View of the Japanese - Jingwen

It has been just over two years since Japan surrendered, and a peace treaty has not yet been officially signed. However, news about Japan is gradually appearing in both domestic and foreign newspapers in important positions. The number of people concerned about the "Japan problem" is also increasing day by day.

In the past, Westerners once regarded Japan as an "enigmatic" country in the East, and the Japanese character was even more difficult to fathom. Japanese women, dressed like butterflies, were as docile as trained cats, while Japanese men often enjoyed killing and competition for pleasure. However, it is not necessarily true that all Japanese men are barbaric and all Japanese women are docile. For example, Japanese small businessmen are no less respectful to customers than Jewish businessmen in Shanghai, and some Japanese women have committed cruel acts of brutally murdering their lovers to satisfy their possessive desires.

In fact, there is nothing incomprehensible or mysterious about the Japanese. Japan's country may have had some mystery in the past, but this was only woven by Japan's feudal historical background and its national religion, Shinto. Separating Shinto from state affairs and liquidating the feudal background, Japan is just Japan, and you will no longer find her mysterious.

However, this work cannot be completed in a short period of time, and whether it can be completed is the real Japanese problem today.

But the Japanese nation does have one characteristic, that is, they are good at opportunism. To put it nicely, they have a strong ability to adapt to the environment. This may be caused by the physical living conditions of the Japanese nation. Because Japan is a small country with scarce resources, it cannot develop without being good at adapting to the environment. Therefore, their national character has fostered opportunism, which has further developed into a characteristic of grabbing and plundering.

The Japanese have a remarkably small mind, but their desire to possess external things is extremely great, which is a manifestation of this character. During the era of the closed-door policy, the Japanese strictly rejected all foreign things, while organizing so-called "Wokou" (Japanese pirates) to commit acts of theft and robbery on the coasts of China and Korea; but after the United States opened Japan's doors with cannons, she changed and imitated everything Western, thus giving rise to the Meiji Restoration era; During the decade or so after the Soviet Revolution and the Chinese Revolution, the Japanese intellectual and political circles once experienced a phenomenon of great activity among left-leaning elements, but after the rise of Fascism and Nazism, Japan followed suit. Although everything was a political adventure for Japan, it equally proved that the Japanese nation is good at opportunism.

Although Japan has been baptized by atomic bombs today, looking at the recent words and deeds of the Japanese, one cannot help but doubt how much the Japanese have awakened. Perhaps we cannot blame the Japanese, because although the world is full of illusions, conditions that Japan can use as opportunistic capital still exist. And the Japanese Bushido spirit emphasizes revenge. If the Japanese really harbor this psychology, then the real Japanese tragedy is probably still to come!

If the Japanese can develop from their unique characteristics such as flower arrangement, tea ceremony, Noh, Kabuki, cherry blossoms, and hot springs, and become an oriental Switzerland, using their clean and exquisite "shoji" (paper screens) to isolate all non-essential thoughts, then it will not only be a blessing for Japan, but also a blessing for world peace. Only one British Empire has completed the conquest of the world from an island nation in history, but the current Britain has long been retreating from the rapids. The world after this will probably no longer have such miracles. As intelligent as the Japanese, they should do more work to "green" Japan.

New Year's Cards - Koman

The New Year holiday has begun, and I have a few days of leisure. However, when I think about not having any money to spend, I feel disinterested. Bored, I open the drawer and rummage through a pile of New Year's cards sent by children, as if seeing innocent smiling faces and pairs of chubby little hands. Some were sent generously with a bow, and some were dropped off and then they ran away shyly. Especially the lower graders are more lovable. Some of them don't write their names, and some give you two or three cards. Flipping through them, a warmth rises in my heart. This is a unique and rare comfort for those who live by chalk dust.

Labor and drawing teachers use the New Year holiday to implement design teaching, guiding children to make their own New Year's cards early on. As a result, one is not practical, because both the sender and the recipient dislike them for not being beautiful and not being serious enough. Moreover, one child told me that buying a white card costs more than twice as much as a New Year's card. The clerk at the stationery store greeted me politely and said, "More than five thousand New Year's cards have all been sold out by your school's children!" Ah! Five thousand cards. If each card costs 500 yuan, what a number that would be!

The Chinese language teacher also teaches how to write New Year's letters in composition class, but the children don't know the meaning of New Year greetings at all. Writing articles is also a boring thing. Although "red plums bid farewell to the old year, white snow welcomes the spring" - a lot of materials were provided, it was still useless, and it was even impossible to grade. As a result, I congratulated myself.

Children "smoothly" or "tearfully" get money from their parents to buy New Year's cards to catch up with the trend. Some children, because they bought too few cards, have no choice but to "burn incense at whatever temple is available" and have to distinguish between "big and small" and "good and bad" to express the thickness or thinness of human relationships.

However, teachers who receive good New Year's cards gradually forget about them after a while and may not give the children any benefits. But some teachers who are dissatisfied because they did not receive New Year's cards bear ill feelings towards the innocent children, find trouble, satirize them, deduct points, and may even secretly "thump their foreheads"...

In the paradise of pure and innocent children, New Year's cards actually teach them to learn snobbery and hypocrisy!

"Single-Plank Bridge" - Wang Baili

Mr. Zhu Banxiang of Shanyin was exceptionally talented. Once, on an autumn night, while lying on his pillow, he playfully composed a poem on the character "声" (sound) in the "single-plank bridge" style, creating twelve interpretations of the "Drunk in Peace" tune, each with unique feelings. The words read: "Loud locust trees make noise, regret for repairs makes noise, rustling leaves fall on the steps, broken window paper makes noise. Deep drums make noise, sparse chimes make noise, a flute across the small building makes noise, connected to the night watchman's clapper on the long street. The neighbor's dog barks, fish leap in the pond, chirping solitary birds roost, bamboo cage with geese and ducks makes noise. Insect girls give noise, tabby cats chase each other, crickets at the base of the wall chirp, rats in the empty beams make noise. The heavy door calls, the high building responds, villagers return drunk, listening to the closing of double doors. Orchid window scissors make noise, scholarly window reading makes noise, widowed young women sob, mixed with children's cries for milk. Buzzing intimate noises, mumbling dream noises, lilting small girl's charming noises, with parents' loving noises. Abacus beads clatter, silk looms weave, pine wind faintly roars, like the sound of a tea stove boiling. Wind rattles tiles, people leave their seats, window panels knock rapidly, imagining the lingering sound of a pipe. Bed hooks clink, window rings swing, galloping horses before the hall, like Ding Chang's jade pendants chime. Empty halls rustle, empty corridors whisper, wet soil under flower shadows with insect noises, making crawling crab noises. Distant noises, close noises, long noises, short noises, lonely quilts until the rooster crows, hoping for the morning bell from the temple." (See "Miscellaneous Records from the Cold Hut," volume 4)

Recalling "Changdian" (Part 2) - Ji Yong

Although I am from Beijing, I don't have any books on the local customs of the old capital. I only remember Zhen Jun's "Anecdotes of the Capital," and the earlier Liu Tong's "A General Survey of the Imperial Capital," both of which have excellent writing about this place. Xian Yuan Ju Nong's "Sounds of Goods in a Year" and Fucha Dun Chong's "Chronicles of the Capital" are even closer to the people. It just so happens that the three kinds from the Qing dynasty were all written by Manchus, and the sense of prosperity and decline described in them is thought-provoking. The temple market, which represents long-term folk customs, is roughly divided into three parts: the north-south line from Hepingmen to South Xinhua Street is a concentration of calligraphy and painting; the east-west area from Haiwang Village to Yangmeizhu Diagonal Street is the center of food, toys, tea, and sightseeing; and the cultural market, which specializes in expensive jade wares, is rarely visited except by high-ranking officials, concubines, wealthy prostitutes, and can almost be called another center.

Books are not cheap, because the stalls are also set up by insiders. Paintings are genuine only when they are fake, and genuine ones are hard to come by. Zhang Fei's masterpiece "Beauty" and Guan Yunchang's calligraphy can all be encountered here, but don't be fooled into thinking you are "traveling with the ancients." The sellers of paintings are usually more impressive than the book stalls, setting up very long and large reed mats, unlike the book stalls, which are exposed to the northwest wind all day long. Li Ciming's "Diary from the Yue Mantang" and Weng Wengong's diary both have many records of "visiting Changdian." The literary style of the Qing dynasty is now difficult to describe. Officials don't know what they are scheming, and university professors are shivering at the thought of 900,000 yuan per bag of flour. Liu Bannong obtained "He Dian" here, which seems to be a matter of more than three generations ago. In short, this requires not only money, but also "leisure." Walking around, you may not get anything all day long, but once you have a "strange encounter," it is not uncommon to gain ten in one day. In my early years, reading the letters and diaries of various families, I often read conversations with Yi Gu Xuan Tong, Liu Niu Nong, and Ma Yu Qing about their winnings, which once made the dull child yearn for them.

Let's talk about sightseeing and food. I really don't understand what so many people are doing there. Perhaps it's just what the "Water Margin" says, "Carriages and horses come and go, people watching people." This watching is important. Zhu Tong lost the young official, and in my experience, there were at least three or four times when I encountered families searching for lost people with yellow flags, knocking on bronze gongs to find their lost children. However, although it seems meaningless, the meaning lies in this. What we want is a little excitement, a little relaxation, a little news, a little change in the festivals and sacrifices, and it is still a peaceful scene. A poem by a person from the Ming dynasty says, "Flowers without peaches and plums are not spring, people with music and singing are peaceful." It is really a bit vulgar but elegant. In the center of Haiwang Village Park, there is a tea stall, built with wooden boards and without any shelter on all sides, offering a panoramic view from a high vantage point. Listen to the sharp deflation sound of the balloon sellers and the shouts of the candied hawthorn sellers. The candied hawthorns are surprisingly large, not for eating, but for playing. This is consistent with the mood of entering Changdian. If every rickshaw returning home does not have a few of these things smeared with white maltose or a sorghum windmill that makes a rustling sound, it is not enough. I used to hate children buying windmills and sticking them on doors and windows, disturbing the neighbors. Now, "this feeling can only be recalled," and I yearn for it instead.

There are also things that are more favored by children, such as wooden swords, ghost masks, and glass trumpets. The "A General Survey of the Imperial Capital" has a passage

### The Ministry of Education, Following the Chairman's Instruction, Offers Relief to Students Coming from Border Regions, Starting in Beijing and Expanding to Other Regions

### Municipal Normal College Students Accuse the Principal of Embezzling Public Funds; Strike Continues Today

[Our Report] The issue of the reasonable treatment of students at the Municipal Normal College remains unresolved, and the strike continues today. The students are demanding that, starting yesterday, the meals be calculated at 300,000 yuan per month per person, according to the new standards issued by the Ministry of Education. They are requesting that the school temporarily cover the cost until the Ministry of Education releases the funds, and that the outstanding balance of the public funds for October, November, and December be issued. As of last night, the school had not provided a concrete response, only stating that the Bureau of Education had already issued all the additional funds for these three months. However, the school believes that the school suffered losses from the meal service provided by the school in October and November, and therefore withheld the funds. The school did not mention or issue the additional fees for December. Students are deeply indignant, accusing the principal of illegally embezzling student public funds. It is reported that the students of the school have announced that today's meal costs are gone as public funds have disappeared, and they have no choice but to continue the strike today.

### The New President of the University of Berlin Hopes Our Country Will Send Students

[Our Special Correspondent, Berlin (Airmail)] The University of Berlin, with its broken walls and bullet marks, is moving towards a new life. This reporter, introduced by Dr. Xiao Yunlai on the morning of the 22nd, drove to visit the new President, Professor Dersch. According to him, the University of Berlin has now restored ten colleges: Medicine, Law, Philosophy, Mathematics and Physics, Economics, Theology, Veterinary Medicine, Agriculture, Forestry, and Education.

Professor Dersch said that the University of Berlin suffered extremely severe burning and destruction during the war. In addition to the damage to the buildings, the most regrettable thing was the loss of the University of Berlin's collection of books. Professor Dersch, who was originally a well-known scholar of labor law, said, "Even taking books on labor law as an example, despite various efforts to collect them after the war, they are less than one ten-thousandth of what they were originally."

He also said that the Soviet military government is currently very interested in the reconstruction of the University of Berlin. The Soviet military government stationed in Germany has allowed all the University of Berlin's buildings to be repaired within one year. It is hoped that when school starts next fall (1948), it will be in the same condition as before the war, and the funds will be provided by the Russian side in installments.

Talking about the issue of professors, President Dersch said that most of the professors who participated in or were inclined to Nazism in the past have been expelled. Only a very small number who have special research in academics still work at the university. They may still be professors, or they may be renamed researchers, but the number is extremely small. At present, the total number of students in the school is about 5,000 to 6,000, and the total number of professors, associate professors, and lecturers is about 150.

President Dersch emphasized "academic internationalization" and welcomed Chinese students to continue to come to the University of Berlin to study as they have done in the past. It would be even better if they could be sent to Germany in large numbers. He personally had many oriental students, and he often felt that Chinese students were more lovely than Japanese students in the past. He said that when he taught at the University of Berlin before 1933, a certain Chinese student graduated and returned to his country. When he said goodbye, the party leader took out his notebook from his class. Therefore, his impression of Chinese students being "motivated to study" is unforgettable.

The University of Berlin is now in the Soviet military district and is deeply controlled by the Soviet Union. Foreign students must be approved by the Soviet military government to enroll, but there has never been a case of unjustified refusal. Before 1933, Professor Dersch was a famous professor at the University of Berlin. He was expelled after Hitler came to power because of his left-leaning ideas. Recently, Strucks was appointed as the president of the University of Berlin.

### The Ministry of Education Orders All Levels of Education Institutions to Pay Attention to the Nutritional Problems of School Children to Avoid Affecting the Health of the Entire Nation

[Our Report] The Municipal Bureau of Education has recently received an instruction from the Ministry of Education, which states that children are in a period of proper development and growth, and in addition to needing nutrition to maintain daily life, they also rely on it to provide the raw materials for growth and development, which is extremely important. During the Anti-Japanese War, prices rose and life was difficult, and the nutrition of the people was lacking. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, due to wartime destruction, all construction and recovery were not easy, and coupled with the chaos of the bandits, the people did not live in peace, and the nutrition of the people was still insufficient, which greatly affected the life of individuals and the health of the entire nation. Therefore, schools should pay special attention to the nutrition of school children. All countries attach great importance to the nutritional problems of school children, and some schools even provide food and nutritional supplements to school children, or the schools raise funds from local charities or student parents to handle it, and the Educational Administration Committee is responsible for the allocation and hires experts to take care of it, and the results are remarkable. My country's national economy has never been developed, and education funding is particularly stretched. Schools cannot afford to provide meals or nutritional supplements for school children, and most student parents are also unable to afford it. In order to promote this important facility, all levels of education institutions should do their best to supervise and guide. When conducting civic training in primary schools and holding meetings for school children's parents, various nutritional knowledge necessary for daily life should be imparted according to the economic environment, the time, the place, and the people, such as the distribution and selection of food, so that school children and their parents know what to pay attention to. If children bring their own lunch to school, the school should have a dining hall and kitchen to serve the children. It is reported that the Municipal Education Bureau has recently ordered all schools to comply.

### The National Sports Committee of This City Employs Various Committee Members; The First Committee Meeting Was Held Yesterday

Hao Gengsheng, a supervisor from the Ministry of Education, came from Beijing to attend.

Li Ximou's Report

Chairman Li Ximou reported on the past operations of the National Sports Committee and said that national sports in this city are still limited to a small number of people. In the future, we should strive for popularization. The current school sports performance is very different from that before the war and should be guided. National sports, as the name suggests, is not limited to schools or a small number of people, so sports halls and sports fields should be vigorously developed. A portion of the park should also be set aside as a children's sports field. The funding problem can be included in the city budget. In addition, popular games and ancient Chinese games can be promoted to make them popular.

Hao Gengsheng's Speech

Supervisor Hao of the Ministry of Education then gave a speech, saying: Today's sports only have activities on the surface of large cities and have not penetrated deeply, so we should take schools as the starting point and work hard to promote them. After the implementation of the constitution, education funding will be secured, and a sports funding item must be included. The current school sports must be improved, and we must grasp school sports and develop social sports, so that people can continue to love sports for life after leaving school. Supervisor Hao also said that the National Games are scheduled to be held on May 5, and a preparatory meeting will be held at the Municipal Education Bureau on January 17.
