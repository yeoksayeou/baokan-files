### Fierce Fighting Around Jinan; Bandit Forces Continue to Increase, Reaching 220,000; National Army Voluntarily Withdraws from Qihe County Seat on the North Bank of the Yellow River

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 18th] The fighting in the outer perimeter of Jinan is intensifying. In addition to the original bandit forces of the 9th, 13th, 10th, 3rd, 6th, New 8th, 11th, and Bohai Columns, and the local communists, starting from the 17th, the 1st and 4th Columns from the Jining area of southwestern Shandong have also been flocking towards the outer perimeter of Jinan. The bandit forces' so-called mechanized rapid column has also arrived to participate, making the fighting more intense than ever before. Among them, the repeated fighting for Yanchi Mountain, Yanchi Mountain, and Maoling Mountain, about four kilometers southeast of the city, has been the most tragic. The bandit army has suffered more than 10,000 casualties. After 9:00 AM on the 18th, the fighting began to ease slightly. To the west and south of the city, the two armies are still fighting along the line from the ancient city of Changqing (10 kilometers from the city) to Yuhuang Mountain and Chaomidian. Queshan, on the north bank of the Yellow River, was fiercely contested throughout the 17th, but it is still being firmly defended by the National Army. However, the National Army voluntarily withdrew from the Qihe county seat on the night of the 17th.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 18th] Since the opening of the Jinan siege, Yanchi Mountain, Yanchi Mountain, and Maoling Mountain, which are about four to six kilometers southeast of Jinan in a straight line from the Thousand Buddha Temple in the south of the city, have always been the main battlefields. Because these mountains can threaten Licheng to the east and control the east of Jinan, starting from the evening of the 17th, the National Army, with the coordination of land and air artillery, launched a counterattack against the bandits at a great cost. The bandits' 13th, 9th, and Bohai Columns and the local communists, possessing more than 30 cannons, launched a full counterattack, causing the sound of planes, artillery, and machine guns to not cease in the entire Jinan area throughout the night of the 17th. By the morning of the 18th, Yanchi Mountain had been briefly recovered by the National Army, but the fierce fighting continues with repeated gains and losses. In addition, the fighting at Kaiyuan Temple at the southern foot of Thousand Buddha Mountain was also fierce on the night of the 17th. By the morning of the 18th, the invading bandits had been repelled.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 18th] Dianliuzhuang, a key point near Hongjialou at the foot of Maoling Mountain, about four kilometers southeast of Jinan, was briefly infiltrated by the bandits on the night of the 17th, but was quickly repelled, eliminating more than 1,000 bandits. Fierce fighting has also broken out near the Agricultural School in the east of the city.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 18th] The bandits attacking Jinan have increased to 220,000. In addition to the nine regular army columns, all units from the central, western, and northern Shandong military regions have been concentrated in Jinan. Although the National Army is outnumbered, under the leadership of Commander Yao Wu, it is actively engaging the enemy. The capital has taken the most urgent measures, and a martial law headquarters has been officially established starting today, with Liu Qixun, the secretary-general of the pacification area, concurrently serving as commander. Martial law will begin every evening at 7:00 PM. The headquarters ordered residents to dig basements and set up more storage pools to prevent accidents. Two-thirds of all male employees of the provincial government agencies have been organized into wartime work teams, with Peng Dong, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Xu Kuiyi, the director of the News Bureau, serving as the team leader and deputy team leader, respectively. The directors of each department and office serve as squad leaders, and they will begin work immediately. The remaining one-third will be responsible for the regular business of the original provincial government. On the 17th, students from the Youth Training Corps were also transferred to the urban area to engage in patrol work. On the 17th, the central government agencies held a meeting and decided that all non-essential personnel should be evacuated.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 18th] According to bandit prisoners, in this bandit army's attack on Jinan, in addition to Chen Yi, the bandit leaders have all sent Ye Jianying to command. The bandits' plan is to sacrifice everything and take Jinan at all costs, so that this "barrier to North China and important coastal town" can replace Yan'an, and a new political consultative conference can be convened and a puppet united government can be established in the short term.

### US Agrees to Use Army and Navy Ships to Transport Chinese Military Supplies; Claims of Wedemeyer's Return to China Dismissed by Washington as Groundless

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The Howard newspaper reported on the 18th that the US Army and Navy have agreed to use their ships to transport supplies to China, as long as China can afford to purchase them. The newspaper said that this agreement was recently concluded between the Chinese government and the Department of the Army, removing another obstacle to the implementation of the $125 million military aid plan for China. Before the agreement, China had to charter commercial ships, which were expensive, and the West Coast longshoremen's strike made the work difficult. However, the newspaper stated that the packaging and inspection fee for every thousand bullets is $20.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] According to sources close to General Wedemeyer, the rumors from Shanghai that Wedemeyer would return to China and be responsible for military assistance are groundless.

According to US law, the receipts from the transfer of such materials should be submitted to the Treasury Department.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said on the 17th that the embassy was unaware of the rumors that Lieutenant General Wedemeyer would return to China to lead a new US military plan for China.

### US Reporter Van Ziewa Claims Internal Strife Seems to Be Occurring Within the Chinese Communist Party

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th United Press] Van Ziewa, a correspondent in Shanghai for the New York World Telegram, reported that the Chinese Communist Party seems to be experiencing internal strife. According to sources deemed reliable, Lin Biao, commander of the Communist forces in the Northeast, seems to be following in the footsteps of Yugoslav Marshal Tito. There are many signs of intense power struggles behind the Iron Curtain in the Northeast. Lin Biao is increasingly acting on his own, while Mao Zedong, the darling of the Kremlin, wants to ensure that the Northeast is safely returned to the Soviet Union. It is reported that the relationship between the civil administration personnel controlled by Mao Zedong and the military and political personnel under Lin Biao is very strained. Lin Biao may break away from Mao Zedong and Moscow, dominate one side, and become a new warlord in the Northeast. He may also join hands with other groups opposed to the Kuomintang.

### Disposal of Remaining Materials Not Yet Properly Handled; President Sets a Deadline for Inventory and Classification; Supervision Team Established in Shanghai, with Zheng Jiemin Concurrently Serving as Team Leader; Daily Necessities Distributed to Civil Servants, Educators, and Social Organizations

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] The President is paying close attention to the disposal of remaining materials. According to recent reports, the disposal of remaining materials has not been properly handled, and there have even been cases of jeeps rusting. The President was very angry upon hearing this and issued a handwritten order to quickly inventory and classify the remaining materials within ten days and dispose of them according to their respective natures. After receiving the order, the relevant authorities have actively strengthened the inventory and classification work and established a remaining materials inventory supervision team in Shanghai, with Zheng Jiemin concurrently serving as the team leader, Jiang Biao as the deputy team leader, and Zeng Qingji, chief of staff of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, as the general manager. The team has begun inspecting warehouses of remaining materials in Shanghai, conducting inventory and classification, and will go to Qingdao and other places to conduct inventory and supervision work.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] In order to increase the national treasury income, absorb idle funds, and stabilize the economy, the government has adopted a variety of effective measures. The disposal of US surplus materials is now being actively carried out. The total amount of surplus materials that have not yet been processed is approximately 5 million tons. Military supplies have been allocated to the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Transportation for military use. Daily necessities and other non-military items have been decided to be sold quickly to supply the market in order to recover idle funds. It is estimated that after the sale of surplus materials (excluding military supplies), 200 million gold yuan can be recovered. After research by relevant parties, it is believed that the method of selling through retail outlets is easily exploited by scalpers for profit and is very inappropriate. The allocation method will be adopted instead. The allocation area will start with Nanjing and Shanghai first. Civil servants, educators, various social organizations, and schools can enjoy the allocation. The Materials Supply Bureau is responsible for the allocation work in Shanghai. An office has been established in Nanjing, and it has been decided to set up an allocation department. The building of the Capital Power Plant at Xinjiekou has been selected as the address of the allocation department. When allocating, purchases will be made with certificates. Allocation certificates are being rushed to be printed in Shanghai, totaling 150,000 copies. They will be taken to Nanjing for use after printing. There are sixteen types of surplus materials for allocation. During allocation, each person is only allowed to purchase surplus materials worth 15 gold yuan per month. The allocation is scheduled to begin on October 1st. If preparations are not completed in time, it will be changed to begin in mid-October. The first batch of surplus materials for allocation in Nanjing is blue cloth, totaling approximately 5,000 bolts. It has been shipped from Qingdao to Nanjing via Shanghai. Each civil servant can purchase approximately five yards during allocation. The work of selling these surplus materials is expected to be completed within three months. However, because some surplus materials have not yet been shipped from the Pacific Ocean, it may take half a year to complete all sales.

### On Hygiene

— Zhou Shang

Written for the Shanghai Municipal Hygiene Exhibition

Another year easily passes, and autumn winds blow once more. In this season when golden winds deliver coolness, the importance of hygiene should be greatly emphasized. People often neglect hygiene in the autumn, but the importance of autumn hygiene is no less than that of summer. Just look at the fact that there are more patients in autumn than in summer, which is a proof. Moreover, epidemic diseases often occur during autumn. The so-called "summer-autumn addiction" is actually cholera, which people in the past called “turning qi”, resulting in many deaths. Cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and so on, are also commonly seen in late autumn. This time, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's hygiene exhibition, which starts tomorrow (20th), should serve as a warning to everyone.

President Chiang's recent launch of the Diligence and Frugality Movement includes promoting physical labor as the third item in the outlined key goals to advance the national health movement because a healthy physique is the source of strength. Precisely because of this, we must pay more attention to hygiene to coordinate with this diligence and frugality construction movement.

Speaking of hygiene in China, it invariably evokes a strong sense of the times, making one unable to suppress the surge of emotions and the feeling of being overwhelmed by the tides of change. Originally, China lags behind others in everything, and hygiene is even worse. The result of this backwardness is selfishness and self-interest in the spiritual realm, and poverty and hardship in the material realm. Because of the lack of attention to hygiene, the disease rate is particularly high, reaching an average of sixteen million people sick every day! Because of the lack of attention to hygiene, the mortality rate is particularly alarming, with more people dying in vain each year than the entire population of Shanghai! Other countries have an average life expectancy of over sixty years, while we remain at thirty years! Diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery have almost become historical terms in other countries, while we are still experiencing annual epidemics. How can we estimate this loss? What can we use to redeem this loss?

The war of resistance has been won, and the enemy has retreated. If those who we expect to shoulder the great task of revival are either mentally abnormal or intellectually deficient, either morally depraved or suffering from various ailments, then I ask, where will the flower of victory, watered by the red blood of millions, bloom? Who will pass on the torch of culture? Can such undertakings be shouldered by people whose bodies and minds are not sound? A weak mind housed in a weak body is nothing but a walking corpse. Our nation is not lacking in the intelligence of an Edison, but lacks the body of an Edison; some may have Edison's body but lack Edison's intelligence. Therefore, we have not yet discovered a Chinese Edison!

Hygiene is a path to achieving health, and our country valued it particularly in ancient times. The term "hygiene" appeared as early as the pre-Qin period. Zhuangzi recorded a passage from Nanrong Zhao asking Laozi: "If Zhao hears the Great Dao, it is like a doctor wanting to add medicine to the illness. Zhao wishes to hear only the principles of hygiene." Both Emperor Yan and Emperor Huang were hygienists, establishing national thought on the principles of hygiene. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the purpose of our national politics is the two words "preservation". It can be seen that far-sighted politicians must advocate hygiene because hygiene is the biological foundation of the nation.

A nation is biological, a country is political. It is absurd to expect political clarity when the biological foundation is poor. Currently, everyone is demanding political clarification but not considering the biological foundation. This is abandoning the root and pursuing the branch, climbing a tree to catch fish. Hygiene is to the people as water is to fish, gaining it means life, losing it means death, this is true for the people and also true for the country. Historians say that the demise of Greece and Rome was due to a few mosquitoes. Was the success or failure of the Panama Canal not due to the issue of hygiene? Hygiene is a very important part of the modernization process; it establishes the foundation for the biological state of a nation. A nation that does not care about the biological foundation, a nation that only knows how to use biological capital but does not consciously and automatically increase this capital, is extremely dangerous. It is also very short-sighted for a country to only study biology for the sake of medicine and animal husbandry, without studying biology for the sake of the intrinsic health of the people themselves, and sooner or later it will suffer the consequences of this shortsightedness.

In recent years, everyone only knows how to compete with others verbally for the so-called position as one of the four great powers or one of the five great powers, but no one asks about how to improve the general quality of the nation to achieve physical strength and stature that surpasses others. Is this not a "lamentable" thing? Currently, we are using the biological capital inherited from our ancestors every minute. Everyone only knows how to use the capital left by our ancestors as much as possible. There will come a day when the oil runs dry and the lamp goes out. If we do not promote hygiene and implement hygiene, I think the day when the oil runs dry and the wick burns out is not far away. Please look at our "complete annihilation" in the Second World Games, and look at how others can maintain their tanks for six hours, while we struggle for two hours. Is this not a sign of national elimination?

Military failure can lead to national subjugation, and neglecting hygiene can lead to the extinction of the race. Everyone should not lightly dismiss hygiene as a small matter, but should know that everything is revealed between the lines. Zhang, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, is aware of this and has spared no effort in promoting hygiene. This time, he is holding a hygiene exhibition in the midst of all kinds of difficulties. His intention is profound and his efforts are painstaking. All of us citizens should understand and practice it. Hygiene is not about talking but about practice. Hygiene habits are more important than hygiene knowledge. Citizens should realize something after seeing the exhibition. Know that hygiene is not only a personal matter, but also a matter for future generations, and even more so for the entire nation. We must use great effort to promote and glorify it, so as not to betray the meaning of this exhibition.

Hygiene does not necessarily cost money; sometimes it can even save money. Hygiene is definitely not a waste; on the contrary, hygiene is very economical. Sometimes it is necessary to invest in hygiene, but this investment is a very wise investment. Professor L. Bomer said, "A ditch in a village is as beneficial to the village as the opening of the Panama or Suez Canal is to the country." In England, community houses with more than 400 people have health construction. In the early days of the Soviet Union's construction expenses, hygiene was also the top priority. Sunlight is a free and inexhaustible tonic. Sunbathing can allow ultraviolet rays to irradiate subcutaneous fat, allowing the body to produce its own vitamin D, which can be used by the body to absorb calcium. Is this not only free but also saves money, saving the need to buy cod liver oil and nutritional products. Brown rice is more valuable than white rice, does this not save money as well? Furthermore, is it not that sufficient sleep and frequent bathing also require money? Can't you eat one less pack of cigarettes and drink a few more bowls of tofu soup?

In addition to emphasizing personal hygiene, we must also pay attention to the safety of society and the public at all times. Personal hygiene and public hygiene are originally one thing. If everyone can focus on themselves, the entire society will naturally become hygienic. Yang Zhu's philosophy of "for myself" in the end also serves society. Chinese people's selfishness and self-interest are abnormally developed. Therefore, while personal hygiene is emphasized, it may simultaneously achieve the effect of public hygiene in other countries, but not in China. Driven by the selfish and self-interested mindset of "everyone sweeping the snow in front of their own door," it is easy to develop into all kinds of "harming others to benefit oneself," and ultimately "harming others without benefiting oneself." Look at the medicine dregs all over the ground, and look at "a double cold, success at first sight." What is this mentality? Claiming to be civilized people, it seems to be a bit better about spitting everywhere, but they don't spit at home, but still spit on the streets and in public places. They don't spit in front of people, but still spit behind their backs. What is the reason for this?

Hygiene is a war, and all countries in the world should participate. The enemies of hygiene are sometimes a bacterium, sometimes a louse or flea, sometimes a fly or mosquito, a dog or a rat, sometimes an inanimate chemical substance, sometimes a product of the human brain or hand, and sometimes it is ourselves. We should start fighting from ourselves! For hygiene and health, we should unite the entire city, the entire country, and all of humanity to fight together. This affects the life and happiness of each of us, and even the nation and all of humanity. Everyone should participate in a part of this battle.

### The Peace and Security Authorities Dispatched Personnel to Tianjin to Crack a Smuggling and Transporting Organization, Capturing Three Key Culprits Who Were Taken to Beiping for Interrogation

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] The Peace and Security Authorities recently cracked a secret organization of the 3rd Smuggling and Transporting Station of the Communist Bandit Jizhong 10th Military Sub-district in Tianjin. The bandit's smuggling and transporting station was disguised as the Dacheng Military Uniforms and Leather Goods Factory, but in reality, it supplied a large number of military leather goods and clothing to the bandits, and transported skilled workers. The key culprits, Yang Baozhen, Wang Zuming, and Jiao Lingfeng, were arrested by personnel sent from here in conjunction with the Tianjin police and gendarmerie and taken to Beiping for interrogation. The remaining criminals, Zheng Xin, Zhang Yunming, Liu Wenbin, and You Yongkang, have all escaped and are being actively pursued. According to confessions, after the victory in the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the bandit station transported military supplies to the bandit area three times via waterways, the first time with thirty boxes, the second time with twenty-four boxes, and the third time with twenty-eight boxes. They also used trucks to transport multiple times, including 15,000 gun slings, ammunition boxes, gun holsters, saddles, leggings, drums, horns, and other items. Jiao Lingfeng also personally led twenty skilled workers to Ba County to take on technical work to aid the bandit rebellion. According to investigations, the bandit station belongs to the Yongmao Fourth Branch, which is jointly organized by the Communist Bandit Jizhong Military Region 10th Military Sub-district and the Communist Bandit Jizhong Administrative Office 10th Special Office. Above it, there is a head office, which belongs to the Communist Bandit Jizhong Administrative Office and the Communist Bandit Military Headquarters.

### Report on the Supervisory Committee's Investigation of the Xu Tao Case

(Continued from yesterday) 3. Regarding the suspicious leads of transaction accounts within the exchange and illegal gains from off-exchange transactions, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau should be requested to summon individuals according to the severity of their involvement, release them on bail or detain them, and submit the cases to the Shanghai Local Court or the Special Criminal Court for handling. 4. Wang, a supervisor appointed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, together with Shen Yunlong, were ordered to examine and verify the transaction amounts reported by each broker from August 17th to 19th, focusing on accounts with over 3 million shares. Based on the aforementioned procedures and the results of separate investigations, the following 22 brokers were found to have sold over 3 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock and/or were suspected of engaging in off-exchange transactions: No. 55, No. 85, No. 95, No. 224, No. 235, No. 204, No. 150, No. 65, No. 135, No. 4, No. 190, No. 129, No. 76, No. 71, No. 16, No. 28, No. 237, No. 213, No. 145, No. 89, No. 12, and No. 2. Among them: (1) Lin Legeng of Securities No. 190 admitted to off-exchange transactions, claiming to have bought 16 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock from broker Du Weiping of No. 237 on August 16th. (2) Those suspected of off-exchange transactions include Jiechang Securities No. 85, rumored to have engaged in many transactions but with very simple records; Lifeng Securities No. 145, with few transactions recorded but a large amount of money exchanged; and Yungcheng Securities No. 2, which failed to clearly explain the source of its involvement with money shop notes. (3) In terms of exchange transactions, Shen Xing Securities No. 76 sold the most, with 11.9 million shares, including 4 million shares for the client Mi Gengji, the largest single amount. Xiangda Securities No. 213's clients, Taiji and Wei Jiangting, came in second with 3 million shares. Very few had more than 2 million shares, and those with over 1 million shares were also rare.

Summoning Many People

Based on the above inspection results, the police bureau was notified to summon Du Weiping on the morning of September 5th. He confessed that he sold a total of 16 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock to Lin Legeng between August 11th and 16th, and on the 19th, he dumped 5 million shares to Tianyu, 3 million shares to Zhenchang, and 4 million shares to Maode. He also stated that at 9:00 AM on the 19th, a client named Li Boqin, accompanied by two women, jointly dumped 6 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock (later confirmed by Tao Liguolan as over 7 million shares), opening accounts under the names "Lan Ji" and "Shu Ji" respectively. He later heard Li Boqin claim to others that he had obtained advance information about the currency reform. Based on this lead, the committee requested the police bureau to issue summons for Li Boqin and the two women for questioning. However, Li Boqin could not be found. Only Li Guolan, who opened the account under "Lan Ji," and Yang Shuyao, who opened the account under "Shu Ji," were detained. Under interrogation, Li Guolan confessed that her husband was Tao Qiming, currently the secretary of the Ministry of Finance and director of the Information Office, who came to Shanghai from Beijing on the evening of August 18th and returned to Beijing by train on the night of the 19th. She admitted to dumping 2 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock at Huamei on the morning of the 19th, while her brother Li Boqin dumped 3 million shares. Yang Shuyao confessed that her husband was Xu Zhuanghuai, currently the chief secretary of the China Petroleum Corporation in Nanjing, and admitted to accompanying Li Guolan to Huamei on the morning of the 19th to dump 2 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock. The case began to come to light at this point. The committee members, suspecting Tao Qiming of being deeply involved, immediately requested Lin Chongyong, director of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, to take responsibility for telegraphing Wang Yunwu, Minister of Finance, and ask him to detain Tao Qiming immediately for further investigation. They also requested Director Lin to inform Minister Wang to maintain strict confidentiality in Shanghai and temporarily refrain from releasing any news in Beijing before the case was clarified, so as to prevent the individuals involved from escaping. Director Lin subsequently reported that he had obtained Minister Wang's consent to temporarily refrain from releasing news in Beijing and had detained Tao Qiming that evening.

Detaining and Interrogating Tao and Xu

In order to save time and thoroughly investigate the matter, the committee members, in addition to presenting opinions based on the situation and results obtained in Shanghai, requested the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to continue the investigation and sent letters to Special Commissioner Jiang Jingguo and Director Lin Chongyong, asking them to supervise and assist. On the morning of September 4th, they returned to the capital and visited Police Chief Huang of the Police Department, and went to the Criminal Police Team to interrogate Tao Qiming with the responsible police officers. After repeated questioning, Tao finally admitted that between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM on August 18th, Xu Baiqi, chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance, had sent a worker to summon him to Xu's office, where he was secretly informed of the plan to temporarily suspend the operation of the money shops and the stock exchange, and instructed to go to Shanghai immediately to inform Yuan Yang'an. His means of transportation to Shanghai were also arranged with Xu's consent, by taking a plane. Tao then discussed with Xu Zhuanghuai and considered it possible to speculate and profit from this information. Xu also asked Tao to invite his wife, Yang Shuyao, to act together in Shanghai. Therefore, Xu Zhuanghuai bought a China National Aviation Corporation plane ticket from Beijing to Shanghai for Tao Qiming, and he flew to Shanghai at 6:00 PM that afternoon. He followed Xu Baiqi's instructions and informed Yuan Yang'an of the news. On the morning of the 19th, his wife Li Guolan invited her brother Li Boqin and Yang Shuyao to go to Huamei Company to sell "Yung Shai" stock short. According to this confession, Xu Baiqi, chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Xu Zhuanghuai, chief secretary of the China Petroleum Corporation, and Yuan Yang'an, a lawyer practicing in Shanghai, were suspected of leaking state secrets and attempting to use this secret information for their own benefit. The committee members immediately notified Police Chief Huang of the Capital Police Department, asking him to detain Xu Baiqi, Xu Zhuanghuai, and Yuan Yang'an separately. However, Xu Zhuanghuai had already left Beijing for Shanghai by car on the evening of September 3rd, when Minister Wang publicly released a statement. The committee members, in addition to requesting the Capital Police Department to send personnel to Shanghai to cooperate with the Shanghai Police Bureau to strictly apprehend him and summon Yuan Yang'an, had Xu Baiqi detained by the Police Department on the evening of September 5th. Unexpectedly, Xu was well-prepared and strongly denied leaking state secrets. After much persuasion, he finally revealed everything, although his confession differed slightly from Tao Qiming's. However, considering the confessions of Tao Qiming and Yuan Yang'an, there was no doubt that he intentionally leaked state secrets and had ulterior motives.

Two People on the Run

On September 7th, Yuan Yang'an was summoned from Shanghai. According to his confession, the content and process of how he learned of the news were completely consistent with Tao Qiming's confession. However, he firmly denied any speculation or profiteering. Whether this was true remained to be investigated, so he was also transferred to the Capital Special Criminal Court for handling by the Police Department. In this case, in addition to Xu Zhuanghuai and Li Boqin fleeing upon hearing the news, making it impossible to ascertain the details and impact of their leaking state secrets and speculative profiteering, the investigation of the criminal acts of all other principals and accomplices was brought to a close at this point.

### Leader of Jewish Stern Gang Admits Masterminding Assassination of Bernadotte, Accusing Him of Being in Cahoots with Britain; UN Orders Dr. Bunche to Temporarily Handle Mediation Work in the Holy Land

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 18th] A leader of the Jewish extremist Stern Gang declared on the 18th that UN mediator Bernadotte was assassinated by the gang because he was "in cahoots with Britain."

Deputy Secretary-General Trygve Lie cabled Bunche in Jerusalem, ordering him to temporarily handle mediation affairs. Bunche is an African-American and was Bernadotte's right-hand man.

According to American Lieutenant Colonel Begley, a truce supervisor who was driving the jeep Bernadotte was in: "We were in the third vehicle as the cars returned. At that time, another jeep carrying several people in uniform blocked the road. We stopped, thinking they were checking pedestrians. Two men with submachine guns questioned us, then approached us. When they saw Bernadotte, they shattered the window with the gun barrel and fired repeatedly. Bernadotte was shot in the heart, and Serot was shot in the head, both died. The assassins then drove away."

Bernadotte's Brief Biography

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] Count Folke Bernadotte, who died in Jerusalem today, was fifty-three years old and was the nephew of Swedish King Gustaf V. His father, Prince August, was the youngest son of King Oscar. In 1888, he relinquished the right to inherit the throne because he married a commoner. He was granted the title of Prince Bernadotte. Count Bernadotte was born on January 2, 1895. After completing his studies, he joined the Guards as an officer. In 1928, he left the military and married Miss Manville of the United States, and served as the manager of a business. Later, he served as the head of the Swedish Red Cross. During World War II, he was ordered to negotiate with Germany to liberate detained Danes and Norwegians, and persuaded then-Nazi Interior Minister Himmler to release all 20,000 people detained in concentration camps in March 1945 and hand them over to the Swedish Red Cross. When the German army was defeated, Bernadotte was summoned to Himmler's headquarters and, on his behalf, offered the Allies the complete surrender of the German army on the Western Front, but the Allies demanded the unconditional surrender of the entire German army. On May 20, 1948, the UN Security Council asked him to serve as the Palestine mediator. Although he facilitated two truces, his work was not fully completed. Bernadotte was also the vice-chairman of the International Red Cross and held many勋章 medals.

### Surrender Ceremony Officially Held Yesterday; Indian Troops Enter Hyderabad Capital; Nehru Considering Governing Methods

[United Press, New Delhi, 18th] Hyderabad Radio announced this afternoon that the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army has accepted the surrender of the Hyderabad army. Prince Belar, the son of the Nizam, represented Hyderabad at the surrender ceremony. General Edroos, the Commander-in-Chief, accompanied by Indian Special Envoy General Munshi, represented India. Major General Chaudhry, commander of the 1st Armored Division, which led the blitzkrieg on Hyderabad, represented India.

[United Press, New Delhi, 18th] Indian troops entered Hyderabad City at 4:32 PM (local time) today and immediately arrested Prime Minister Laik Ali, who had just resigned on the 17th, members of the cabinet, and key members of the Muslim volunteer corps. Volunteer leader Qasim Razvi is not in Hyderabad City, and Indian officials have issued an arrest warrant. Chaudhry, commander of the Indian 1st Armored Division, has been appointed Governor of Hyderabad.

[United Press, New Delhi, 18th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru convened a cabinet meeting on the 18th to consider the fate of the Nizam dynasty, which has ruled Hyderabad for two centuries. The Nizam has accepted most of India's conditions, such as banning the Razakar Muslim extremist organization, stationing Indian troops in Secunderabad, and forming a new government. India has not yet indicated whether it intends to recognize the emergency governing council established by the Nizam on the 17th and presided over by Prince Belar. In the current chaotic situation, Hyderabad will be governed like Japan under MacArthur, at least for a few days. Due to the intricate and delicate nature of religious issues, a final resolution is likely to be delayed. It is believed here that the Nizam's throne will be decided by a plebiscite under the auspices of India. However, India's attention has shifted to Kashmir. The press predicts that the troops currently in Hyderabad will be redeployed north to deal with the Muslim irregulars of the Pakistani army in Kashmir. The Indian government announced that telephone and telegram communications between India and Hyderabad have been restored on the morning of the 18th, but before normal conditions are restored, only official military communications are allowed. The Minister of the Interior praised the efforts of the police for the absence of Indian-Muslim conflict throughout India during the military operations in Hyderabad. All India Radio also denied reports of Indian-Muslim conflict within Hyderabad.

It is reported that Zhao Bojun has a friend named Chen who operates a coal business and has 500 tons of coal that he intends to transport from Tianjin to Shanghai for sale.

### Authorities Improve Economic Inspection Work; Establish Inspection Standards; Focus on Not Disturbing the People; Primarily Inspect Large Warehouses and Hoarders

[Our Reporter] It is reported that the economic management authorities will improve the economic inspection work based on the experience of the past month. The first step is to establish inspection standards to make them reasonable and adapt them to local conditions. For example, when dealing with hoarding cases, the decision to confiscate or force the sale at a fixed price will be made based on the objective circumstances and the severity of the situation. Secondly, future inspections will be based on the principle of not disturbing the people or being overly meticulous, and efforts will be made to simplify laws and procedures. The target of inspections will be primarily large warehouses and hoarders. The competent authorities have issued an order requiring inspectors to be moderate and kind when performing their duties. Any extortionary behavior will be severely punished once verified, and those who report it will be rewarded. If bribery occurs, both the bribe-taker and the bribe-giver will be equally guilty. The letters of informants must include the true name and address. The inspection agency will keep their information strictly confidential. Reports using false names and addresses will not be accepted.

### Gold, Foreign Currency, and Gauze; Black Market Eliminated

Since the implementation of economic control, prices have generally stabilized. According to reports received by the Supervisory Office, the black market for gold, foreign currency, and gauze can be said to be completely nonexistent. The amount of deposits in banks has increased three to four times compared to before the currency reform, and interest rates have also fallen sharply. According to relevant officials, in order to maintain market stability, economic inspection work must be further strengthened. As of now, the major "players" at sea have not committed any obvious illegal acts, so they are only being warned and instructed to maintain the stability of prices in their respective industries. At the same time, it is hoped that in the future, if citizens have reports to make, they can report major players as much as possible and not pay too much attention to minor matters. As long as the evidence is conclusive, no matter how powerful their background is, they will be dealt with severely according to the law. In recent days, staff members have discovered that some people are carrying large amounts of gold, foreign currency, and silver dollars to leave Shanghai, with suspected intent to flee. If this is discovered again in the future, those who do so before September 30 will be forced to exchange them at the Central Bank. Those who conceal and fail to report after the deadline will be punished. The measures are currently being drafted.

### Subletter Beaten to Death; District Procuratorate Indicts Three

[Our Reporter] Li Xu Zaoxian, a local resident, rented a room on the mezzanine floor of No. 54, Lane 50, Kulun Road from Yang Huang Xiuying last year, agreeing on a rent of 250,000 yuan in legal tender per month. The rent was increased by 100,000 yuan in June of this year. At the end of June, Yang requested to collect two dou of white rice from July 7th, but Li refused because the demand was too high. On July 7th, Yang asked Li to pay again, resulting in a conflict between the two sides, followed by a mutual fight. At that time, Li's cousin Xu Muna and Yuan Zhichang happened to be there and immediately helped Li beat Yang, causing injuries. On July 20th, the two sides fought again over minor matters, and Li and the other two surrounded Yang and beat her again.

### Saving Public Property and Funds; Eliminating Long-Standing Habits; New Work Style of the Grain Purchase and Storage Association; Praised as a Model of Thrift

[Central News Agency] The head of the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Association of the Ministry of Food, Mr. Yang, can be said to be a representative of government officials in Shanghai whose life and work truly embody the spirit of the National Thrift and Construction Movement. The reporter believes that all facilities within the association are worthy of being a model for public agencies and civil servants throughout the country. The association has no guards, no messengers, and even no janitors. The transmission of official documents and the handling of official business within the association are all done by each individual personally. During office hours, all employees, except for burying themselves in work, are prohibited from drinking tea, reading newspapers, smoking, or chatting. Yang always fills out the association's quarterly forms himself, making the situation of the association clear at a glance. They make every effort to save public property and funds. The size of all documents is reduced to the minimum, and their use is particularly economical. The reporter found a stack of discarded official paper collected by Yang and envelopes made from used envelopes in his desk, proving that he also utilizes waste materials. Yang's emphasis on thrift can be said to be personally practiced. When asked about his opinion on promoting the National Thrift and Construction Movement, he pointed out that "avoiding waste and striving for rationalization in everything are the minimum goals that the Chinese people should strive for." He said: "China's material resources are currently very difficult, but if the Chinese people can all avoid waste, there is still a surplus. Our country is currently relying on food aid from foreign countries, but at the same time, we allow teahouses and restaurants to be full every day, which is the most unreasonable phenomenon. Every time I attend a banquet, I feel deeply pained in my heart." His efforts to be rational in everything can be proved by the following two things: The content and format of official documents have been reformed first; the office space of each employee in the association does not exceed 2.5 square meters. Yang and all the staff share a room, use the same desks and chairs, and occupy the same area. His explanation for this is that his purpose is not to be an official, but to train cadres for the country, so he must set an example so that the spirit of superiors and subordinates will not be disconnected. Yang's relatives have repeatedly urged him to give up his poor government job and return home to do business, but he believes that serving the country should be hard-working and thrifty, and personal interests should not be considered. Before serving as the director of the association, Yang served as the Director of the Construction Department of Jiangxi Province, the Secretary-General of the Chongqing Municipal Government, and the Mayor of Harbin. Yang Chuoan personally practices reusing old envelopes.

### Typhoon's Power Greatly Reduced; Gradually Turns into Low Pressure

[Our Reporter] After the typhoon landed in northern Fujian the day before yesterday, it was resisted by the mountains on land. After consuming a day and a night, the wind force was greatly reduced, and it gradually turned into a large continental low pressure, moving in a northwesterly direction. By last night, the center reached the border of Zhejiang and Jiangxi. As a result, there were strong winds and rain in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

### Former Traitor Zhou Fohai's Shanghai Residence Grand Robbery Case Cracked, Valuable Ornaments' Estimated Value Exposed, Male and Female Criminals Arrested One After Another, Internal Connection Revealed as Dismissed Female Servant

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the evening of June 26th this year, a robbery occurred at No. 324 Hunan Road (formerly Rue Corneille), the former Shanghai residence of traitor Zhou Fohai. A large amount of precious ornaments such as pearls and diamonds were robbed, with an extremely high value. Afterwards, the victim Rong Liang Shihui reported the case to the Changshu Police Precinct, which was forwarded to the Criminal Investigation Section of the General Bureau. Section Chief Na dispatched Squad Leader Feng Qishan and others to investigate. After more than two months, the case was finally solved, and a large number of stolen goods were recovered. Currently, in addition to continuing to pursue the accomplices who are still at large, the four male and female robbers who have been arrested have been requested by the District Prosecutor's Office to extend their detention for further investigation to determine whether they have committed other crimes. According to reports from our correspondent: After the case occurred, police officers worked painstakingly, but because the robbers were also exceptionally cunning, even though the robbery lasted a long time, they did not leave any fingerprints at the scene. Afterwards, because they had robbed thousands of US dollars, they did not spend the stolen money, so the network of clues they had set up…

...did not develop at all. Until the 16th of this month, Section Chief Peng received a confidential report stating that someone was openly showing a valuable jadeite pearl necklace (one of the stolen items) to jade dealers at Chunhua Building on Daxin Street for valuation. He immediately ordered Squad Leader Feng to supervise the investigating police officers Qian Daqi, Zhang Jingyu, Zhang Yunming, and Ding Zhaogan to investigate the source of the item. As a result, they learned that the necklace belonged to Ma Shoubai, the owner of Tongchang Jewelry Store at No. 397 Zhongzheng Middle Road. The police officers disguised themselves as jewelers and lured Ma into custody. According to his confession, the necklace was not his, but was entrusted to him for sale by Yang Zhenhua, the chairman of the Liren Society at No. 5 Renhe Lane, Changning Road. After summoning Yang for questioning, he confessed that it belonged to Zhang Yunting, the head of the society. Yang then led the police to No. 1 Dongtangzi Jing, Hongqiao Road, where Zhang was arrested. A gemstone gold ring was also seized on the spot. After interrogation, Zhang confessed to having conspired with others to…

...rob Rong's residence, and also revealed that there were accomplices hiding in a thatched shed at Wangjiazhai on Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, and at No. 702 Xixin Street, Chang'an Road. As a result, Zhang Haibo and his wife Li Fengying, and Tong Hongyou, were arrested, and a large number of stolen goods were recovered. Finally, Zhang Yunting led the police to his mother-in-law's house in Pingwang Lane, Yongle Road, where a revolver with five bullets was recovered. After individual interrogations of the suspects, it was learned that the insider who provided information in this case was Li Fengying (also Zhang Haibo's wife), a female servant who had been dismissed from Rong's residence in January of this year for improper conduct. Because there are still accomplices at large, the case is still…

...under continued pursuit. The recovered stolen items include: a jadeite pearl necklace, a diamond-studded jadeite gemstone gold key, two diamond-studded watches, a one-carat diamond ring, an Omega men's watch, a gold bracelet, a gold chain, a pair of jadeite diamond jade earrings, a pair of square diamond earrings, two gold-set jadeite rings, one ruby, one emerald, one platinum ring, a gold chain bracelet, a square gold watch, a gold chain strap and gold square box, a beaded handbag, etc., a total of nineteen items, accounting for about eight-tenths of the stolen goods.

### Worsted Wool Price Limit Issue, Social Affairs Bureau Negotiates Several Points, Fashion Industry Will Request Factory to Dispatch Goods

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon convened representatives from the Wool Textile Industry, Worsted Wool, Silk and Satin, Cotton Cloth, Western Clothing, and Fashion Trade Associations to discuss and study the issue of worsted wool price limits: (1) Group Weaving (heavy wool) was not available on August 19th.

(2) For worsted wool with prices available on August 19th, all retail stores should strictly follow the prices on August 19th. At the same time, in order to maintain factory re-production, the profits of retailers and wholesalers will be appropriately reduced to effectively cooperate with the price limits. (3) In order to reduce the profits of intermediaries and reduce costs, the fashion industry will request each factory to dispatch goods under the overall planning of the trade association.

### Supervisory Committee's Report on the Xu Tao Case (Continued from Page 2)

(II) Truth of the Case

Based on the aforementioned on-site investigation, the truth of this case includes the following points: 1. The content of the leaked state secret was the order drafted by the Ministry of Finance on August 18th and announced on the 19th to "Temporarily Suspend the Business of Banks, Qianzhuang, and Trading Houses." 2. This confidential and important document was dictated by Vice Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance, with the consent of Minister Wang, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM on August 18th in Vice Minister Xu's office, and was drafted by Xu Baiqi, the chief secretary of the ministry. 3. After Xu Baiqi finished drafting the order and left the office, he informed Secretary Tao Qiming of the contents of the confidential order, instructing him to go to Shanghai that day to inform Yuan Yang'an. 4. After learning of this confidential news, Tao Qiming consulted with Xu Zhuanghuai, the director of the Nanjing China Petroleum Corporation of the Resource Commission. Xu Zhuanghuai purchased a plane ticket for Tao Qiming for that day, and Tao took a China Aviation flight from Nanjing to Shanghai at 6:00 PM. Xu also asked Tao to inform his wife Yang Shuyao to jointly participate in short-selling for profit. 5. After Tao Qiming arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 PM that evening, he discussed speculation with his wife and arranged to meet Yuan Yang'an by phone. Yuan was out, but after receiving a call from Yuan, Tao went to Yuan's place at 10:00 PM that evening to convey Xu Baiqi's confidential news.

Establishing Accounts for Short Selling

6. Li Guolan, Tao Qiming's wife, invited Xu Yang Shuyao and Li Boqin to Huamei Company, operated by Du Weiping, at around 9:00 AM on the 19th of August. With the introduction of Li Boqin, they separately opened "Li Ji" and "Shu Ji" accounts, short-selling more than 7 million shares of Yongsha stock, with Li Guolan selling 2 million shares, Yang Shuyao selling 2 million shares, and Li Boqin selling more than 3 million shares. Although Li Guolan had previously engaged in stock trading, it was said that this was her first time since returning to Shanghai from Taiwan. 7. After short-selling at Huafu, Li Boqin stated that he had learned of the currency reform news. The stock market fell sharply that day. Whether this was caused by him spreading the news is still under investigation as he has not been detained. 8. Whether Xu Zhuanghuai spread this news to others after learning of the secret, allowing them to use it for speculative profit-making, is still under investigation as he has not been detained. 9. It has not yet been determined whether Yuan Yang'an used this information for speculative profit-making on August 19th. If such a situation exists, whether he colluded with Xu Baiqi is also under investigation. 10. In addition to being a legal securities broker, Du Weiping also established Huamei Company to operate over-the-counter trading, which is illegal. Whether the short selling of 12 million shares of Qing Shui Sha stock by Huamei and its 137th Securities Firm on August 19th was based on the news provided by Li Boqin cannot be confirmed because Li Boqin is on the run.

Dereliction of Duty and Misleading the Public

Based on the analysis of the above facts, it is known that the occurrence of this case was actually due to the deliberate leakage of important secrets by Xu Baiqi, the chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance, with ulterior motives. Regardless of whether the suspect had speculative profit-making facts, his crime of leaking secrets, undermining the government's financial and economic emergency measures, and endangering the country should be severely punished according to law to serve as a warning. Tao Qiming, the secretary of the ministry, used confidential information for speculative profit-making, which is illegal. Moreover, spreading the news and causing disturbances constitutes knowingly violating the law, which is also unforgivable. Xu Zhuanghuai, the director of the Nanjing Petroleum Company of the Resource Commission, colluded with Tao Qiming to use confidential information for profit-making, which is a clear violation of criminal law. In addition, Wang Xitang, the supervisor of the Ministry of Finance stationed at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and Shen Yunlong, the supervisor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stationed at the exchange, had the duty to supervise and inspect the trading venue for illegal trading activities. They did not fulfill their supervisory responsibilities in advance, and after the committee members were instructed to conduct a strict inspection, they did not provide a thorough report on the illegal trading activities. This constitutes dereliction of duty. Minister of Finance Yu Yunwu trusted close associates and was negligent in his examination, leading to the easy leakage of important state secrets, and it is difficult to absolve him of the blame for employing personnel improperly and neglecting his duties. The above-mentioned personnel, whether they are administrative leaders or important officials, should have acted loyally and cautiously in the implementation of constitutional government and the earnest promotion of financial and economic reforms. However, they neglected their duties, misled important affairs, and were extremely inappropriate. Their cases should be severely punished according to the severity of the circumstances. Li Guolan, Yang Shuyao, Du Weiping, etc., either used confidential information for speculative profit-making or privately established firms for illegal trading, and should all be punished according to the circumstances and according to the law. The two criminals Li Boqin and Xu Zhuanghuai should still be apprehended by judicial authorities to uphold the law.

Rectifying Official Conduct

In short, at this difficult time for the country, when the government is striving for reform, any act of wrongdoing will not be tolerated by the law. The Supervisory Committee is responsible for supervision and should take action under the scrutiny of the world to rectify official conduct and appease public sentiment. In addition to requesting the police authorities in Nanjing and Shanghai to transfer the entire case and the criminals for continued investigation and legal processing, the committee will submit the investigation process of this case, along with the attachments, to the court for verification. This is submitted to President Yu, with eleven related attachments and a list of attachments. Committee members Tang Honglie, Sun Wanglin, September 22nd. (End)

### Western Lake's Strange Phoenix and Heavenly Tide

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of This Newspaper

[Our Newspaper's Rapid Report from Hangzhou, 17th] These past few days, the banks of West Lake have been experiencing the crisp and refreshing weather of autumn. The crystal-clear moon illuminates the lake surface, and the willows along the embankment bow their heads, whispering softly to the green grass. Tourists row boats, bathed in the moonlight as bright as day. The oars break the silence, heading towards the fragrant depths. This reporter has previously predicted that this year's autumn excursion to Hangzhou will be unprecedentedly lively. Since September 12th, all the large and small hotels in Hangzhou have been completely booked. Several large hotels are planning to borrow villas elsewhere to serve as accommodations for guests. Restaurants and wine shops are all … bustling, and those who arrive later have to wait for a table to be vacated before they can be seated. Rickshaws and palanquin carriers are charging in gold yuan, demanding at least 30 cents. A trip from the train station to the lakefront costs two yuan, and renting a boat costs ten gold yuan. Recently, the boats have been booked solid. I think those who come later will have to rent bathhouses, cars, and cafes, as they did during the spring excursion, as their temporary residences.

Lack of Outlets for Speculative Capital

Legislator Chen Xiaocen told the reporter: "This year's autumn excursion to Hangzhou is truly unprecedented, mostly because speculative capital in Shanghai has no outlet. People who trade in gold, US dollars, cotton yarn, etc., feel that there is no way to do business, so they come to Hangzhou to relax. First, prices are stable. Secondly, the boring speculative buying and selling has led people to come to Hangzhou to relax. But it is also true that the stable prices allow them to play for a few more days. The cool autumn has come very early this year, and the tide in Haining is particularly high. These are all reasons why Hangzhou has become the darling of the times."

Watching the Night Tide on the Eighteenth

Wang Huzhen, the deputy director and chief engineer of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, told the reporter, "The tide this year is truly very large." Just when the tide control project that the Seawall Engineering Bureau was working hard to build was about to be completed, nature unexpectedly changed the course of the river again. The sandbank outside the seawall collapsed, and the surging waves came again. The cultivated land outside Qibao was flooded, and thousands of residents were threatened. Mr. Wang Dongyuan went to watch the tide, and his jeep was pushed into the fields behind the seawall. It is said that the tide at that time was more than ten feet above the seawall and sounded like a mountain collapsing and a tsunami. Wang Huzhen once told the reporter with scientific analysis: "The tide is often determined by the movement of the moon. The tide will be higher when the moon is full because the Chinese calendar is determined by the Imperial Astronomical Bureau established in the feudal era. Since the Republic of China, the new calendar has been used, and the natural shift means that the 15th of the Chinese calendar should fall on the 16th. The 15th is the 14th. Then there will be big bends within a few days from the 16th to the 19th, but the tide will be even bigger at 12:00 PM on the 18th and 19th." Therefore, friends who come to Hangzhou for sightseeing and want to watch the tide should watch the night tide on the 18th. You can see its magnificent posture of rushing with thousands of troops, making you feel like a hero, and strengthening the power of life.

Beauty and Hero

Because of the tide, many important people gathered in Hangzhou and went to Haining to watch the tide. Vice President Li Zongren came, former Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaohong came, He Yaozu came, Minister Zhu Jia… came, Minister He Yingqin is coming, and the American Batavia is also coming. In addition to enjoying the gentle and beautiful scenery of Hangzhou's lakes and mountains, they also went to see the magnificent tide. The two creations of nature evoked two kinds of appreciation. One side is a gentle and beautiful girl, and the other side is a free and uninhibited hero, but this beautiful girl and uninhibited hero are also the result of the hard work of thousands of people.

Autumn Harvest Reduced by Wind and Rain

This year, the Jiang has reported wind and rain disasters in fifty-one counties, which has certainly affected the autumn harvest. In addition, the Hunan granary has banned rice exports due to the major floods. Jiangxi has also banned rice exports because Hunan has no rice to export. Under these circumstances, the food supply in Zhejiang, which has always been known for its grain shortage, is bound to face considerable problems. The city of Hangzhou, which has very little farmland and little production, will be greatly threatened. This year's autumn excursion to Hangzhou is not only lively but also very long and may drag on until the end of autumn and the coming of winter.

### Foreign Banks Begin Reporting Foreign Exchange, Can Be Transferred and Stored in the Short Term

[Our Newspaper's Report] The work of commercial bank foreign exchange reporting has largely come to an end. According to responsible sources: After strict review, many banks have been found to have made false reports or deliberately not reported. Some banks have been ordered by the Gold Control Bureau to re-report, and it has been stated that if there are any further violations, they will be severely punished, and they may be ordered to suspend business if necessary.

### Financial Industry Capital Increase Issues: More Difficulties for Small Banks and Firms

[Report from our newspaper] According to a responsible person from the Shanghai Banking Association speaking to our reporter, regarding the issue of capital increases for the financial industry in this city, larger banks and firms are not finding it particularly difficult, but smaller banks and firms have not completely overcome the difficulties. Therefore, this group sent three representatives, including Cai Songfu, to visit Director Lin of the Financial Control Bureau (金管局) some days ago. They presented the difficulties to Director Lin based on the various issues related to capital increases previously drafted by the Banking Association. It is reported that Director Lin expressed considerable sympathy and promised to forward the matter to the Ministry of Finance for instructions.

Regarding the gradual reduction of interest rates, the person stated that silver and money businesses have already reduced interest rates twice recently. The 6.6% interest rate on overdue payments and 2.1% interest rate on deposits set on the 17th were implemented only after obtaining the consent of the Financial Control Bureau. In the future, they will gradually reduce interest rates to make them more affordable.

As for the matter of commercial banks and firms depositing foreign exchange, the person stated that large banks and firms are complying with the regulations. Some small banks and firms have not yet completed the reporting procedures, and the responsible parties in the Association are actively urging them to do so, hoping that all members of the industry will support national policy and provide detailed reports.

### Financial Control Bureau Orders Provincial and Municipal Banks to Reduce Lending Rates within a Deadline

Regarding the adjustment of deposit and lending interest rates for banks and firms, a responsible person from the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau recently told our reporter that after the government announced the measures to restrict deposit and lending interest rates for banks and firms, the Bureau immediately ordered the three industries associations of banks, money firms, and trusts in this city to forward the order to all banks and firms to comply. Starting from September 1st, interest rates were to be reduced by up to 10%. Starting from September 16th, interest rates were to be reduced to within 5% per month. However, commercial banks and firms believed that forcibly lowering interest rates within the time limit would easily affect the market. They complied with the order by gradually reducing interest rates from 12% per month to 7.5% from September 1st to 15th. From September 16th, they further reduced the rate to 6.6%, and will continue to reduce it to within 5% per month in the shortest possible time to comply with the regulations. The Bureau found this reasonable given the circumstances and has reported it to the Ministry for review and approval. The situation for provincial and municipal banks is different, and the Bureau has separately informed them to reduce lending rates to within 5% starting from today (18th).

### Shanghai Region Collects 160 Trillion Legal Tender Notes in One Month

The currency reform has now been in effect for a full month. During this month, the Central Bank and various entrusted banks have collected large amounts of gold, silver, foreign currencies, and legal tender notes. It is understood that as of yesterday, the total amount of legal tender notes collected in the Shanghai region is approximately 160 trillion (equivalent to over 50 million gold yuan coupons), resulting in a significant reduction in the amount of legal tender notes circulating in the market. The figures for collections in other regions are also considerable, but far less than in this city. As for how to dispose of the collected legal tender notes in the future, the authorities are still considering it. It is possible that they will be concentrated and incinerated after the redemption period expires, or used as raw materials for papermaking.

### Chen Changtong Discusses Improved Overseas Remittance Situation

[Report from our newspaper] Chen Changtong, manager of the International Department of the Bank of China, recently returned from the United States.

In the Philippines alone, the amount of money remitted back to the country from August 20th to September 15th has reached over one million US dollars. Before the reform, weekly overseas remittance income was only over one thousand US dollars. As long as domestic prices continue to stabilize, overseas remittance income will inevitably increase in the future.

### Slight Fluctuations in Rice Prices; Limited Price Increase Leads to Stronger Flour Sales

Rice market prices fluctuated slightly, initially showing a slight increase. However, due to stagnant sales, prices quickly declined, resulting in a stable market overall. Arrivals were still limited, and local sales were normal, resulting in subdued trading. Southern market: White japonica rice was priced at 20.06 yuan, while thin japonica rice held at the limited price of 21.50 yuan. Northern market: High-quality thin japonica rice decreased by 0.20 yuan, while lower-quality rice increased slightly by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. High-quality rice remained stable. Total arrivals in the northern and southern markets yesterday were 2,653 *shi* (石).

Flour

Increased strongly, because the limited price for No. 2 flour was raised to 7.62 yuan (factory price), and the retail price increased to 7.80 yuan. Therefore, market sentiment improved, and prices increased further, with the rise being particularly strong. Old *che* (車) flour was not available. *Bingshuan* (兵船) flour was priced at 7.47 yuan, an increase of 0.22 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands of flour increased uniformly by 0.12 to 0.13 yuan. Wheat bran was priced at the limited price of 5.33 yuan.

Grains

Remained firm. Yellow soybeans were being supported by foreign firms, so high-quality goods remained firm. *Che* (車) soybeans were priced at 12.33 yuan. However, average quality *zha* (乍) soybeans were transacted at 10 yuan, resulting in a stable market overall. Northern corn sales were active, and the price increased slightly by 0.10 yuan. Red sorghum was in demand, resulting in brisk trading and a price increase of 0.20 yuan. *Yuan dou* (元豆) prices remained stable. Foreign firms were interested in sesame, resulting in a firmer market trend. Shelled peanuts were also in demand by foreign firms. Xuzhou and Kaifeng were both priced at the limited price.

Edible Oil

Became uncertain again due to the temporary suspension of export permits. Sellers lacked the strength to resist the downward trend, and prices decreased. Soybean oil was only offered at 48 yuan by Datong, while the lowest spot trading price was 47 yuan, a decrease of 1 yuan. Rapeseed oil decreased significantly, with raw oil decreasing by 0.50 yuan, refined oil decreasing by 58.50 yuan, and small junma (軍蔴) oil decreasing by 2.50 yuan. Soybean cake factory prices remained stable.

### Limited Transactions in Keemun Black Tea

In the foreign firm tea market, the Keemun *Jiangjunqiao* (將軍橋) cooperative recently offered black tea in Shanghai. Although British firms Jardine Matheson and Concorde approached the sellers to negotiate, their offers were only between 180 and 190 yuan per *dan* (担). However, the sellers were unwilling to sell at those prices due to high costs, resulting in continued stalled transactions. Other varieties were also traded based on individual prices, resulting in limited transactions. Market sentiment remained stable overall. As for tea sold domestically, supply and demand were balanced, resulting in fluctuating prices.

It was recently learned that before the Mid-Autumn Festival, tea merchants from Tunxi in the tea-producing region came to Shanghai and discussed the local tea market. Due to strong demand from various buyers, supply was already less than demand. In addition, the tea-producing season has already passed, so inventories are decreasing, leading to rising market prices. Looking at the overall situation, if prices continue to rise, the outlook for tea sales in this city will become less optimistic.

### Private Cotton Mill Production and Sales Association Holds Representative Meeting Yesterday

The cotton spinning industry association in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai regions, in order to align with the government's economic policies and strengthen the connection between private industries' production and sales, specially organized the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai Private Cotton Mill Joint Production and Sales Committee.

### Cotton Yarn Market Sentiment Declines; Limited External Sales of Cotton Cloth; Many Sellers Willing to Sell

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation was such that market sentiment declined immediately due to the authorities' temporary suspension of measures to export goods. Buyers stopped purchasing, and local sales were also scarce, causing the market to decline gradually. There was an insufficient supply of high-count yarn in the market, but there were frequent searches for it from the weaving industry. The market for high-count yarns, such as 42-count Jincheng and 32-count Yinyue, remained steady to slightly positive. 21-count Shuangma was priced as low as 745 yuan, but with some small purchases, it eventually recovered slightly, but the final result was a decrease of 18 yuan compared to before the festival. There was an abundant supply of yarns below 20 counts, and the trend was also good. The market was stable, with 586 pieces traded.

Yesterday, cotton cloth sales were slow because export measures were temporarily suspended, causing export sales to stagnate. Buyers stopped buying and started selling. In addition, the authorities were strictly auditing account books, warehouse receipts, and warehouses. Furthermore, because the Textile and Construction Company (紡建公司) was selling high-end goods, the supply was plentiful, and the market was flooded. Various parties in the market became more willing to sell, and sellers became anxious, rushing to sell.

12-pound *longtou* (龍頭) fine cloth initially opened at just a little over 4 jiao (角), but then the prices went down again to 27.50 yuan due to the refusal of the number companies (號家) and dyeing factories, a sharp decline of 9 jiao compared to before the festival. Throughout the day, *sijunzi yuan biji* (四君子元嗶嘰) was the popular and well-selling item, with many buyers offering just 0.25 yuan. The prices of other cloths decreased by 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 yuan, but colored cloth and *shilin* (士林) cloth remained at their original levels. 1,180 *pi* (疋) were traded.

### Export Limited Prices Appropriately Increased to Meet Domestic and Foreign Market Needs

The export limited prices announced and implemented by the Export Control Commission (輸管會) were originally set based on the actual situation of various export goods in the foreign market. It is understood that the Commission will appropriately increase the minimum prices for Keemun black tea, sesame cakes, and other items for the coming week (September 20th to 26th) It will also add minimum export prices for straw hats, shelled peanut cakes, and No. 5 new Keemun black tea specially sold to Australia. There will be no changes for other items such as hog bristles, pigskins, fur, wool, hair, feathers, straw hats, tea (excluding new Keemun black tea), and casings. The minimum F.O.B. US dollar prices for the above-mentioned amended goods for export are as follows: Straw hats (sold to Australia) $0.35 per dozen, sesame cakes $65 per long ton, shelled peanut cakes $65 per long ton, No. 1 new Keemun black tea $0.40 per pound, No. 2 new Keemun black tea $0.30 per pound, No. 3 new Keemun black tea $0.25 per pound, No. 4 new Keemun black tea $0.18 per pound, No. 5 new Keemun black tea $0.14 per pound.

### Large Quantities of Yarn and Cloth to be Transported South

Since the ban on the export of yarn and cloth, the demand for yarn and cloth in various parts of South China, which has always relied on Shanghai for support, has suddenly decreased. There is currently a shortage of supply, which is causing high prices and affecting public sentiment. The Guangdong authorities previously telegraphed the China Textile Corporation (中紡公司), requesting that the company rush 200,000 *pi* (疋) of cloth and 2,000 pieces of yarn to Guangzhou to meet urgent needs. After receiving the telegram, the company presented this situation to Supervisor Jiang for approval. In principle, there is generally no problem. However, in order to avoid stimulating the calm prices in Shanghai, the China Textile Corporation has planned carefully in advance and is currently contacting all relevant parties to start transportation. As for the quantity of the first batch to be transported, it will depend on the tonnage of the ships contacted.

### Wang Zhengting in America Talks About Asian Games Welcomes Participation After Signing Peace Treaty with Japan First Asian Games Not Desired to Be Held in China

[United Press, New York, September 17th] Dr. Wang Zhengting, President of the Chinese Amateur Athletic Association and head of the Chinese delegation to the World Games, predicted on the 17th: "Once the peace treaty with Japan is signed, Japan will be welcomed to attend international sports competitions. The only obstacle for Japan to attend the planned 1950 Asian Games is the peace treaty with Japan, but it is hoped that it can be resolved by the 1952 World Games." Dr. Wang has a deep impression on Japan's recent amazing achievements in swimming competitions. Dr. Wang also said: "China does not intend to propose holding the 1950 Asian Games in China, because sports fields, hotels, and other facilities are lacking." Wang said: "China's performance in London was better than we expected. Due to the lack of competition and training opportunities during the recent ten years of war, we did not hope for any amazing performances in London. Holding the National Games in mid-May was an expedient measure. We believe that the athletes with the most training and practice opportunities performed the best, such as the athletes from the mountainous areas of the former Free China, whose performance was the worst, those from the war-torn areas were mediocre, and the overseas Chinese were the best." Wang also said: "We gained a lot of experience in London, and we are very proud of the spirit of the long-distance runner Lou Wen'ao. Lou ran to the tenth lap in the 10,000-meter long-distance race, and his feet were bleeding, but he still finished the last fifteen laps. This kind of spirit deserves to be promoted to the world." Wang concluded: "He believes that the World Games football competition should adopt a 'best-of-three-games' system, and should not be a 'knockout tournament.' China will propose this suggestion to the International Football Association."

### The Dreadfulness of Wives

— Xu Qinwen

A few rattan chairs have been added to the teachers' lounge. This is the school authorities' kind intention, knowing that teachers are always thirsty and tired after class. Sitting in these chairs, drinking a glass of water, and relaxing can restore their spirits. With these chairs, the room is brand new, which makes people like it. The head of the teaching group, who is supposed to take care of it at any time, often goes in, and the general affairs officer, who purchased these appliances, also often sits there. During class time, the teachers are all in the classrooms. At this time, the head of the teaching group and the general affairs officer meet unexpectedly and sit there chatting.

"Front door brand cigarettes," the general affairs officer said, taking a puff of the cigarette and pinching the butt, "These two days there are cheap ones to buy; it is said that they were confiscated from hoarders who refused to sell them, and the police confiscated them and sold them at a flat price. It's a pity that the money hasn't been issued yet, so I can't buy a few packs. Actually, it would be nice if I could buy one pack."

The cigarette butt was very short and was about to burn the fingers that were pinching it, and it seemed like he wanted to throw it away. But a quick glance made him feel that he could barely take another puff. He cupped his hand and took a deep puff, and then quickly threw it diagonally into the waste bin, making a "hiss" sound.

"There is still no news about the new salary," the head of the teaching group echoed, "A pack of cigarettes is a small matter; I have two children to register, and the deadline has already passed. I don't know what to do. For the sake of the children's tuition, I try my best to save money during the holidays as usual. But the accumulation is not much. With miscellaneous expenses, there is still a shortage of rice. One hundred and eighty catties each, three hundred and sixty catties, will cost one hundred and fifty million. I was hoping that last month's salary could be issued on time."

Every time there is an adjustment, the salary is usually delayed because the forms have to be transferred back and forth for verification. Before the adjustment, prices always rise sharply, and everyone uses up their money waiting for their salary; the salary always happens to be delayed. This time it is the conversion to gold yuan, and it is also the time when schools are starting.

Therefore, Director Sun has even taken off his ring from his finger to exchange it for his younger brother's tuition. Like you, who don't have children studying in secondary schools, you can be a little more relaxed.

"How can I be relaxed? Paying fees in elementary school also costs a lot. Seven or eight gold yuan is more than 20 million. Last month's salary, I only got more than 30 million. Oil, salt, firewood, and rice, the so-called seven necessities, are needed every day. These two days, the cigarettes I smoke are borrowed from the stalls at the school gate, one pack at a time. If I can't get the money, I don't dare to go home. Haha! Now I am afraid of my wife. I am so afraid of my wife that I don't even dare to go home!"

"Is your wife quite fierce?"

"My wife is usually easy to talk to. As long as there is oil, salt, firewood, and rice, she doesn't care about anything else. I didn't have to make her afraid of me, and I didn't need to be afraid of her. Now going back is terrible; no matter what, when I go in and meet her, as soon as she asks if the salary has arrived, I am terrified. Saying that the rice is already eaten, the firewood needs to be bought, and the oil and salt are also gone. I can't deal with it, so I have no choice but not to go back and let her borrow from the east and drag from the west. It's easier for her to borrow a little when I'm not at home. But it always has to be paid back; so the more days pass, the more I dare not go back, and my wife's face becomes more and more terrible."

"Yes," he mentioned the oil, salt, firewood, and rice. If there is no money to buy them, the wife becomes terrible. How much does the grocery store owe, how many millions does the rice store owe, how many millions does the tofu cost, and how many millions does the oil cost, all of which are still owed to the stores. She rambles on from afar and wants to bring up all this to me. I find her terrible, so I haven't gone home for many days.

A thin, tall man with glasses, who teaches history and geography, suddenly came in. As soon as the head of the teaching group saw him, he greeted him. "Mr. Zhao, do you have class next period?"

"I already taught my class this morning," Mr. Zhao replied, "I don't have class this afternoon."

"Then why haven't you gone home yet?" the head of the education group asked.

This question elicited Mr. Zhao's complaints. He sat down and opened his mouth. "Going home, I haven't been able to go home for a whole week. I have a home but can't return, because I'm afraid to see my wife's face. Hmm! She doesn't speak, but her tightly furrowed brows are always there to indicate: the rice is eaten, the firewood needs to be bought. She is waiting for me to go back and solve it, hoping that I will go back sooner. Just now I inquired with Accountant Wang, and there is still no news about the salary. I翻 through the newspapers, and I can't find any clue. What's the point of going back empty-handed?"

Smiling bitterly, the head of the teaching group and the general affairs officer looked at each other.

"When I was in the military in the past," Mr. Zhao continued, "I once heard a sergeant say that he only went home once a month, on the evening of the day he was paid. Because there was little money, he said that he had married a wife and couldn't go home often, as if he were going to Gongchen Bridge (note). At that time, I only found it ridiculous; now I deeply understand his sadness."

"Then everyone is the same," the head of the education group said softly, "Everyone is in this situation."

"We," the general affairs officer stuck out his tongue and interjected, "are all afraid of our wives!"

"Yes," Mr. Zhao said loudly and solemnly, "I am also afraid of my wife; now, the wife is so terrible!"

[Note: Gongchen Bridge was formerly a commercial port and the location of public prostitutes.]

### Three Recent Poems

— Zhang Yiqu

Sent to Ye Yuhu's Appreciation of Literature

When will the war end and all directions be clear? The society is startled by wind, rain, and dust! Old Xu Jun's loyalty shines, The lungs and intestines of the poet Jia Dao are poured out (At the age of fifty, I received the five-tone ancient poem). The beard and eyebrows are white and unpretentious, The children's feelings are easy to get. Fifty-four years have passed in a dream, You should pity me for not returning to farming.

Transmitted on Logging and Suppressing Communists in Siming Mountain

The sound of hometown echoes thousands of miles again in the autumn wind, The sound of logging startles the sleepy old man; I remember that I once stayed briefly in Siming, The frost burns the maple leaves, and the mountain is red.

Thoughts on Late Autumn

The traveler's clothes are half bathed in the setting sun, The autumn wind blows cool in the country, The setting sun points to the distant green mountains, The withered grass feels cold in the white hair; After the Qin fire, the eastern mansion is desolate, The setting sun shines on Yue City beside the western window, When will I return to plan for my family, Rebuild the garden and count the halls?

### Thirty-Four

— Tiao Ying

This is a true story.

A few years ago, an old gambler walked into a casino in a city in the western United States. He sat down at the roulette table and took out some chips, betting on "thirty-four."

The roulette wheel turned and slowly stopped. The casino clerk said, "Thirty-four. Sir, this is yours." He put the old man's money on "thirty-four" on the roulette wheel.

The old man didn't move. The roulette wheel turned again, and when it stopped, it was "thirty-four" again. The casino clerk looked at the old gambler uneasily, but the old man still didn't say anything, his finger still pointing at "thirty-four."

The roulette wheel turned and stopped, and it was "thirty-four" three times in a row.

At that time, many people gathered around to watch, and everyone was a little surprised. However, the old man still remained calm.

"Thirty-four" came out five times in a row. At that time, the clerk came out to say hello, and he said politely, "Ladies and gentlemen, we are very sorry, we will have to suspend here for the time being." He faced the old man and said, "Old sir, congratulations, please take your money--"

But he suddenly turned pale and couldn't say anything.

It wasn't until that moment that he remembered that the old man had not only never said a word since the first round, but had not even moved at all. On closer inspection, the gambling master had already passed away.

### On Writing Fees

— Xiao Tui

The example of writers receiving fees for their writing has been recorded in Yong Rong Zhai's notes. It existed as early as the Jin Dynasty, but flourished in the Tang Dynasty. Li Bei Hai (Yong) received gifts worth millions for his writings. Pei Du commissioned Huangfu Shi to write the Fu Xian Temple Stele and gave him many carriages, horses, silk, and brocade, but he was still not satisfied and added a reward of 9,000 bolts of silk. Bai Juyi and Yuan Zhen were close friends. After Yuan passed away, Bai Juyi wrote his epitaph and still received saddles, horses, silk, brocade, and jade belts as thanks, worth more than six or seventy hundred thousand. Liu Mengde Changli wrote: "The price of one word from Yan Yigong is like a mountain of gold." Those who despised it at the time called it flattery for the tomb. This trend slightly subsided after the Song Dynasty. Jie'an Manbi wrote: "Someone asked Sang Min to write an article, entrusting it to kinship, but was stingy and did not give a fee. Sang said: 'I have never written an article for free in my life. You can temporarily place a silver ingot on my desk to encourage and inspire me. After the article is finished, return the ingot along with the article.' This can be called strange."

Tang Bohu had a huge book recording the articles he wrote for people, and he titled it "Lucky Money." When Ma Huaizu, a contemporary, asked Zhu Zhishan to write an article, Zhu asked: "Is there a glimpse of spirit?" This is because in the Wu dialect, silver coins are called "spirit." Ma replied: "There is a glimpse of spirit." Zhu then happily picked up his pen. Chen Baisha was good at painting, and those who sought his work wore out his doorstep. Baisha jokingly wrote on the side of his seat: "The crow-sound people are here again." People did not understand and asked about its meaning. Chen said: "White waste—white painting—" Everyone burst into laughter.

Yuan Zicai would not produce poetry or prose without money. In his later years, he became wealthy and reclusive, living a luxurious life. The money for managing the Sui Garden and indulging in pleasure was all obtained from his flourishing pen. Yu Quyuan also had a set fee: 50 taels of silver for articles within 1,000 characters, and double for those over 1,000, and he also had a poem: "The price of the inscription on the Duke Gong stele is not cheap. How can I, with my humble knowledge, be suitable? Only because I occupy the seat of a famous mountain, people scramble to ask for the words of the lower classes. Dare to be tired of asking again and again, but because I am seventy and my strength is declining. Although the scholars laugh at me for being foolish, they may understand this intention." Lin Qinnan also imitated Yu's example and set a writing fee rate and prefaced it with a poem: "Relatives and orphans are waiting to be fed, what can this mountain man do? I don't increase the painting fee to seek a share, what's the point of sitting and listening to the cold discussion?" After this, it became a trend.

Although the fee poems each have different intentions, the main thing is to judge based on the person's mind and demeanor. However, upon closer examination of their tone, there is not much difference. It is generally difficult for scholars to achieve prominence, and they often like to use this opportunity to vent their full of complaints. Given this great opportunity, how could they easily let it go? Therefore, it is rare to see someone who can find peace of mind and get rid of their anger in this. There are even those who are extremely sharp and self-righteous, such as Xu Zhiling's poem: "I have wasted twenty years at sea, drunkenly leaning back and sitting in the blue sky. The rabbit hair is exhausted and my body is old, in exchange for selling rhetoric in the world!" Scolding the empty air, as if hearing his words, as if seeing the person.

The Buying-Writing Yuefu written by Guo Shoujing of Weitan is an extreme display of mockery. Its words say: "I can't be a bandit or a robber when I'm big, and I can't be a thief or a pickpocket when I'm small. Scholars are born in this world, and they are destined to rest. What kind of poverty do you suffer, what kind of attention do you draw! (First verse) My wife can't be sold to charm, and my son doesn't know how to gain power. A bald pen is worth my life. Why put on a stinky front, inviting laughter and scolding! (Second verse) My wife can't be sold to charm, and my son doesn't know how to gain power. A bald pen is connected to my life. There's nothing new, it's for the sake of money. (Third verse) I can't be a traditional celebrity, and I can't associate with fashionable politicians. Without a signboard, who would recognize me! What's black and white, issue a writing fee! (Fourth verse)" The world is playing, the训 is with thorns, just this one end, it is enough to be poor all his life.

Zheng Banqiao's fee poem is the originator of this way. The predecessors still had some embellishments, but Zheng was straightforward and didn't hide anything. He didn't doubt it and established the bold style of "No matter relatives or friends, no exceptions, please don't open your mouth, the gentleman is self-disciplined," which is enough to make hypocrites stutter. "Sending gifts is better than sending silver, with money you are a hundred times more energetic, both writing and painting are good." There is not a single word that is not wonderful. This kind of shylock tone, expressed in a straightforward way, does not need to be polite and entrust, is to say what people dare not say, to do what people dare not do, how can etiquette be set for us! A quick person, a quick thing, worthy of being a running dog under Xu Qingeng's door.

### East Scale West Claw

— Jin Lin

The first successful blood transfusion was in 1667, performed by the surgeon of King Louis XIV of France, in Beli Mountain. He transfused lamb's blood to the boy. It was not until the discovery of blood types in 1900 (discovered by Dr. Landsteiner) that the application of human blood transfusions became popular.

### Capitalized Numbers

— You Mojun

The numbers from one to ten in our country are very easy to alter because their strokes are too simple. Therefore, there are capitalized numbers, such as 壹, 貳, 叁, etc., to replace them. Like today's use of checks, capitalized numbers are required, which has become a convention. According to ancient books, 壹 and 一, 貳 and 二 have the same pronunciation and meaning. Like Mao Shi Guan Jiu Xu Yun: "To satirize the lack of 壹也"; and Yun: "The lack of 壹也 in intention"; and the main text says: "Its ceremony is 一也." This is that 一 and 壹 are used interchangeably. Mencius Shen Nong's words "Following Xu Zi's way, the market price will not 貳," shows that 二 and 貳 were already used interchangeably during the Warring States period. The word 叁 is not found in dictionaries, it is a slight change of the word "參"; but ancient books used the word 參 to replace the word 三, like Yi Jin Ci Yun: "叁 days two lands one"; Shi Wen Yun: "參, seven nan fan, also like a word, sounds like san." The so-called "like a word" means that "叁" can also be written as "參." Also, Zhou Li "Set its 參," note that "卿三人." These can all be used to prove that 參 replaces 三.

The five capitalized characters 肆, 伍, 陸, 玖, 拾 and the five lowercase characters 四, 五, etc. have the same sound but completely different meanings. Like 肆 is a verb, used to mean "Chen," see Mao Shi Xing Zhang Zhang "Or 肆之筵" sentence note. 伍 is a collective noun, five people are "伍," see Zhou Li Xiao Situ "Meeting its ten 伍 and teaching the way and art" sentence note. 陸 is also a noun, Gao Ping calls it one 陸, see Zhou Yi "Gradually on 陸" sentence note. 玖 is also a noun, Shuo Wen Yun: The jade of stone is black, the poem says: "一贻我佩玖," then 拾呢, Shuo Wen Yun: Pick up, from the hand, combined sound. 一故 is a verb. There are also obscure meanings found in the scriptures, which will not be listed again.

Among the capitalized numbers, the character 捌 is not found in the classics! According to Ji Jiu Yun: "農器也," is also a noun; but what shape is this "捌," it is no longer possible to examine, so it can be allowed to always replace "八"下去.

There is also a character 柒, which is also not found in the classics. The oldest way to replace seven is with "漆," which can be proved by the words "Zhou Gong Xi sees paint ten scholars." According to the paint itself is the name of a tree, Mao Shi "Mountain has paint." Paint can also be written as "桼." Later there was also the use of "桼" to replace seven, see Shu Xi Bing Fu: "In the morning, the nine tripods are offered, and in the evening, the house of Nai E is lodged." This word is the 省笔 of "桼." The "柒" character currently in use first appears in Shan Hai Jing "Gang Shan has many 柒 trees," this 柒 is originally the lacquer tree, so the character 柒 or 字的俗写.
