### Formal Announcement from the U.S. State Department: Long-Term Aid Plan for China to be Proposed, Amounting to Approximately $570 Million

[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 8th (Broadcast): The U.S. State Department has officially announced the new figure of $570 million for loans to aid China. However, the government is still attempting to temporarily delay the loans to China until the European Recovery Program is underway. Several members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have expressed opposition to this, with Congressman Walter Judd and many other members advocating for immediate aid to China.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Nanjing, 7th: The U.S. State Department announced on the night of the 6th that it would request Congress to approve a $570 million aid plan for China. After the news reached here, officials expressed satisfaction, and at the same time, they believed that since President Zhang Qun made a public statement on the 28th of last month on the Chinese government's views on the U.S. aid to China issue, and presented ten major financial and economic reforms to be implemented, the U.S. government's actions to aid China were significantly more active than before. Although the reports received here by late night were still incomplete, and officials had not received formal reports, and the specific details of the U.S. government's proposal were still unknown, regardless, our current need for foreign aid is a fact, and the assistance extended by American friends due to the long-standing friendship between the two countries is truly appreciated. If this proposal can be supported by the U.S. Congress and passed quickly, coupled with our own well-planned self-help program, this year's situation will be greatly different. Last year, the main goal of the current government was to lay a good foundation before the establishment of the constitutional government. If the ten financial and economic reforms elaborated by President Zhang can be successfully completed soon with the aid of the U.S., financial stability can be gradually achieved, and fiscal balance can be sought, then administrative reform and military reform can be implemented subsequently, or even complement each other and lead to success together.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] The U.S. State Department officially announced on the evening of the 6th that the State Department may request Congress to approve an aid plan for China amounting to $570 million. This amount is $270 million more than the initial estimate of aid to China made by Marshall four months ago, and cannot be regarded as a formal request approved by President Truman. On the evening of the 6th, the State Department, at the request of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, informed the committee that the government would request a total of $9.333 billion in foreign aid appropriations (including the portion for aid to China) for the initial fifteen months, starting from April 1st. U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas (who is assisting the Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Aid Programs) sent a letter to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, listing the amount of aid to each country as follows: The first category, included in the budget appropriations proposed by the President, is: $6.8 billion for the European Recovery Program, $1.4 billion for the administration and relief of occupied areas, and $133.3 million for the Philippines' war damage recovery and veterans' benefits, the last item has been approved by Congress. The second category includes aid to China and other foreign aid appropriations, with a total amount of $1 billion, of which $750 million is included in the budget appropriations proposed by the President, and the remaining $250 million is what the President will soon request Congress to approve. The second category includes aid to China, military assistance to Greece and Turkey, aid for the recovery of Japan and South Korea proposed by the Department of the Army, Pan-American military cooperation, and aid to Trieste, the latter four totaling less than $500 million. Douglas said that significant progress has been made in the aid plan for China, and he can point out that Congress may be requested to approve $570 million for China.

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The aid plan for China outlined by U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas on behalf of the various departments of the government in his letter to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is the "engine" of a long-term aid and reconstruction plan for China. Douglas estimated that the cost of the aid plan for China may be $570 million, but he also stated that this figure does not represent a formal request that has been approved by President Truman. Of the $570 million, $470 million will be used to purchase food, cotton, gasoline, and other raw materials, and the remaining $100 million will be used to purchase machinery to improve Chinese factories.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The Republican Four-Member Committee plans to meet with Vandenberg on the 8th to discuss changes to the European Recovery Program. Vandenberg hopes to submit the foreign aid bill to the Senate on March 1st.

### Bei Zuyi Negotiating in the U.S.: Loan for Our Currency Reform; Lou Tongsun Says the New Currency Will be on the Gold Standard

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, told United Press on the 7th that Bei Zuyi is negotiating with the U.S. government for a loan of between $300 million and $500 million to serve as the specie reserve for China's new currency system. This loan is unrelated to the rumored $500 million in U.S. aid. The U.S. aid will be used to stabilize the economic situation and lay the foundation for currency reform, and it is expected to be of great use. The $500 million loan can not only promote economic stability, but also has great value for anti-communist military efforts. Negotiating the loan is part of Bei Zuyi's mission. Bei has also brought several currency reform plans that can be submitted to the U.S. government for consideration. The new currency system under consideration is roughly based on the gold standard, with silver coins as subsidiary currency. Some parties in the United States advocate that the currency should be based purely on silver, but this cannot be implemented in China.

### Joint Meeting of Five Legislative Yuan Committees: Reviewing the National General Budget; Decided to Form a 19-Member Subcommittee for Detailed Study

[Our Newspaper's Report] Nanjing, 7th: The Legislative Yuan's Legal System, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, and Military Affairs Committees held a joint meeting at 10 a.m. on the 7th to review the national general budget proposal, chaired by Liu Kejun. During the meeting, there were approximately two opinions on the Executive Yuan's proposed general budget for the first half of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948]: One opinion was that the various items of revenue and expenditure listed in the proposal were too vague and unclear, and failed to reflect government policies. It was advocated that the heads of various ministries and commissions be invited to attend the review meeting to re-discuss and clarify the proposal. The other opinion was that the current government is in a transitional period, and the government's implementation of the constitution is imminent, making it difficult to re-formulate policy guidelines. President Zhang explained this point at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 5th, and pointed out that the government is still making every effort to pay attention to finance, economy, and finance in order to obtain a stable currency value foundation, which is actually one of the important policies, and it seems that it can be largely agreed upon. Finally, it was decided to form a 19-member subcommittee (each of the 11 Legislative Yuan committees will recommend one person, in addition to the heads of the 5 standing committees, plus 3 members of the Finance Committee, totaling 19 people), convened by Li Yun, and the heads of various ministries and commissions will be invited to participate separately for detailed study. As for the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting originally scheduled for the 12th, it was decided to postpone it because the review of various proposals still requires time.

### Provincial and Municipal Budgets for This Year: Still to be Drafted According to the Original Method

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] It is learned that the Executive Yuan originally ordered the provincial and municipal governments to draft and submit for approval the drafting of the general budget for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948] and the verification of central subsidies after the "Provisional Adjustment Measures for Local Financial Revenue and Expenditure in the 37th Year" are approved and implemented. It is now heard that the above-mentioned measures require time to complete the legislative process due to changes in the revenue and expenditure system. The first half-year budgets of the provincial and municipal governments urgently need to complete the review and approval process, and time is pressing. Therefore, the provincial governments are still ordered to handle matters in accordance with the provisions of the "Measures for Drafting and Reviewing the General Budget of Provincial and Municipal Governments in the 37th Year" and the "Provisional Measures for Drafting the General Budget of the Central and Provincial/Municipal Governments in the 37th Year."

### Ministry of Economic Affairs to Formulate Precautions for Export of National Goods to the U.S.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Nanjing, 7th: Due to exporters' lack of understanding of trade conditions and import requirements in the United States and Hawaii, there have recently been instances of goods being shipped to ports and then denied entry. Zhang Daze, Director of the International Trade Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, upon returning from the United States, discovered in San Francisco and Honolulu that many Chinese goods had arrived but could not be imported. Although businessmen requested Zhang to negotiate, it was ineffective.

### China Still Considering Whether to Participate in the International New Tariff Agreement

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The new tariff rates discussed at the United Nations Trade and Employment Conference and the tariff reduction consultation conference have been implemented since January this year. More than ten countries, including the UK, USA, France, Canada, Netherlands, and Belgium, have participated. China is still considering the matter. According to sources, China will remain in a wait-and-see attitude until the United Nations Trade and Employment Conference concludes its third session, the United Nations Trade Charter has not been formulated, and an international commercial organization has not been established. No decision will be made on participating in the international new tariff agreement. It is understood that China's current considerations can be divided into two aspects. From a favorable perspective, participating in the international agreement's new tariff rates can reduce the cost of exported goods and encourage exports, and it can demonstrate cooperation with countries that advocate the implementation of new tariffs. There are also two unfavorable aspects: foreign goods imported into China can also enjoy lower tax rates, and under the current restrictions on imports, customs revenue will be reduced.

### United Nations Press Conference to Be Held in Geneva; China Designates Ten Representatives to Attend

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information is scheduled to be held in Geneva on March 23rd.

Therefore, there should be a plan for foreign exchange, and it is possible to transfer locally stationed personnel. For example, Zhang Pengchun, the representative of China who originally participated in the small group meeting of the Conference on Freedom of Information, may still serve as a representative. As for the rumors that Deng Youde and others have been decided to participate, it is currently undecided. Deng specifically stated tonight that this matter has not yet been decided, and this news is inaccurate. The conference period will last for more than a month.

### Philippines Expels Overseas Chinese Vendors; Chen Zhiping Protests Strongly; Yesterday Presented a Note to the Philippine Foreign Ministry

[Central News Agency, Manila, 7th] Our ambassador to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, returned to Manila yesterday after a month of vacation. Today, before the Philippine authorities made a decision on the issue of overseas Chinese vendors in the Philippine Supreme Court, he presented a note to the Philippine Foreign Ministry to express his protest. The note was worded strongly, stating in essence that the Philippine Foreign Ministry should assist the overseas Chinese vendors who are being banned to resume business, or assist the vendors to obtain a written guarantee from the Philippine government allowing them to establish their own markets. The note also pointed out that the issuance of the ban seemed to regard overseas Chinese as the only foreign merchants operating in Philippine markets. It also said that this measure by the Philippine authorities not only violated the spirit of the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship, but also caused unnecessary tensions in the friendly and pleasant relations that have existed between China and the Philippines.

### How to Balance the National Budget?

At a time when currency values are falling and prices are rising, simply studying the budget in terms of figures has very limited significance. Therefore, although the national general budget for the first half of this year has been officially announced, it has not been able to attract widespread public attention. At the same time, during the Legislative Yuan's review, everyone abandoned these figures and instead focused on general fiscal policies for concentrated discussion. This is an inevitable result.

For example, both ordinary revenue and expenditure are listed as more than 26 trillion yuan. The revenue portion, totaling fifteen items, is said to be all regular income and fairly reliable. However, according to last year's price index, the inflation rate has reached fourteen times. Under this malignant inflation, price increases will inevitably accelerate month by month, and the valuation of various commodity taxes, despite being adjusted monthly to keep up, will ultimately not keep pace with the rate of price increases. Moreover, many items, such as the surplus of state-owned enterprises, fines and compensations, donations and gifts, etc., may not be adjusted periodically according to ad valorem taxes. Therefore, this portion of revenue and expenditure may not be fully offset, as estimated by the authorities. As for the special revenue item, the listed loan is 800 billion yuan. Considering the performance of last year's US dollar bonds, how much of it can actually be realized is even more questionable.

If expenditures increase unexpectedly due to price increases, and revenues decrease significantly due to uncertainty, the natural result will inevitably be to increase issuance to make up for the deficit. The result of increased issuance will inevitably stimulate prices, thereby increasing expenditures and creating a larger deficit. If this cycle continues, with each being both cause and effect, the extent of the gap in the final accounts in the future is really impossible to predict and truly frightening.

At a time when the Communists are causing disturbances and military affairs are pressing, if the above-mentioned gap is to be filled by reducing expenditures according to the usual methods, it is probably an impossible task. Therefore, the only remedy, apart from increasing issuance, is to increase revenue again and balance the budget. There is no other way. As for the US aid item, the figure has been announced as US$570 million up to recently, which is indeed larger than the previously rumored US$300 million. However, the details of its contents have not yet been reported in detail as of this writing. Whether a portion can be transferred in the future to make up for the budget deficit, and if so, whether it can be used in the first half of this year, and whether it can be passed by both houses of parliament as proposed, with or without amendments, are all unknown. Therefore, if this gap is to avoid issuing banknotes, we still have to rely on our own efforts to find a solution.

Based on the principle of contributing according to ability, the property donation item was already considered a legitimate measure for extraordinary times during the War of Resistance against Japan. Last year, it was discussed and a plan was formulated, and it seemed to be inevitable. It is expected that the result of the implementation will be considerable, because it is compulsory and completely targeted at fixed households. In addition to its emergency effect on finance, it also embodies the meaning of averaging wealth. Everyone believes that it is fair and just. Unexpectedly, after several delays, it suddenly changed its nature in mid-stream and was changed to a special relief donation. Although it is still a special donation, its nature has changed to a voluntary donation. Its purpose is also limited to relief work and refugee relief. Although the outcome is still difficult to predict now, its effect on making up for the budget deficit and increasing the national treasury is limited, because this item is not listed under the expenditure items. Although the total amount listed by the departments in charge of the Ministry of Social Affairs is 114.1 billion yuan, we believe that the proportion used for relief and refugee relief may not be very large.

Secondly, there is the item of abolishing redundant agencies and reducing unnecessary expenditures. This was already included in the emergency economic measures announced on February 17th last year. Now, looking at the budget table, it is of course impossible to see whether this measure is included. However, judging from the recent announcements of the authorities, there is no sign of drastic action to implement this matter. In addition, in the special revenue part, the proceeds from the sale of state-owned property and materials are listed as 165 billion yuan, accounting for 3.68% of this revenue, while in the ordinary revenue part, 126.7 billion yuan is also listed, accounting for 0.476% of this revenue. The total of the two items is not very small. However, for various reasons, the sale of all state-owned enterprises seems to be subject to imperial restrictions and has not been carried out to this day. It is difficult to believe that it will be actively carried out in the future. Moreover, the enemy and puppet industries and materials that were easy to sell have already been sold out. It is especially uncertain how much of the remaining ones can still be sold in the next six months. As for the income from state-owned enterprises, only 600 million yuan is listed in the ordinary part and 4548.3 billion yuan is listed in the special part. Even if these figures are very reliable, they seem to be less than what people generally expect.

The general public has indeed suffered enough from inflation and the depreciation of the legal currency. In the private sector, production is shrinking and life is difficult, revealing a picture of not being able to survive. In the government, resources are stretched and things are difficult, reaching the point of exhaustion. Now that the fact of fictitious revenue and real expenditure and a huge deficit is clearly in front of us, in order to maintain the status quo and avoid deepening the deterioration of finances and the economy, we must make every effort to find ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure in order to strive for a balanced budget. Although it is a common knowledge that there are no resources to exploit and no magic to turn things into gold, financial difficulties and economic peril are not unique to our country. Looking at countries such as Britain and France, the huge number of deficits and the desolation of the national economy are alarming and put them in extremely difficult situations. The difference is that they have overall methods and courage. In addition to large-scale government cuts, they are willing to endure temporary and extreme pain in currency system, prices, foreign exchange, production, consumption, and international trade in order to fight against the harsh environment. However, our country is perfunctory and covers up the problem, and has never come up with a complete set of solutions. With a solution, such as using foreign deposits, absorbing overseas remittances, levying property donations, etc., we are still timid and have too many considerations, and cannot use thorough means. Continuing to muddle along without a plan, relying solely on increasing banknote issuance to get by, and relying on some piecemeal measures to deal with the current situation will probably not only make everyone feel helpless about the budget, but also make the future of the entire national economy extremely bleak.

However, things must be said from two sides. The government has its responsibilities, and the people also have their responsibilities. At this time of great difficulty and imminent disaster, if the people are still living in a drunken dream and are not aware of the situation, but are only living by speculating, hoarding, evading taxes, and evading capital, and are only seeking to evade and circumvent all laws and regulations, colluding and engaging in corruption, and are unwilling to abide by the law and cooperate sincerely with the government, then even if there are good laws and intentions and solutions to save the times, I am afraid they will be ineffective. Everyone is very clear that the embezzlement and corruption of all tax revenues, the manipulation from top to bottom, and even tax evasion and smuggling are definitely not the responsibility of the tax officials alone. The deterioration and distortion of all economic controls, the fact that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, and even the complete failure in the end are definitely not the responsibility of the government alone. It must be known that with the spread of the Red Disaster and the devastation of the people, will there be complete eggs under an overturned nest? On the contrary, the higher the taxpaying ability, the more severe the suffering and destruction will be. And the wealthier the family is, the more luxurious the enjoyment is, and the more illegal profits are earned, the clearer the target will be and the more impossible it will be to escape. Therefore, everyone should not evade the obligation of the people to pay taxes, but should shoulder it together. Increasing the revenue of the national treasury by one point will reduce the danger to oneself by one point. In particular, the wealthy merchants, rich gentry, and all those who have made a fortune from national disasters and speculation should set an example and do their best to contribute to special relief donations, national donations, and all legitimate taxes in order to alleviate the country's urgent difficulties and appease the public's resentment. This is the only way to balance the budget. The way to avoid increasing issuance lies here. And the way to stabilize prices, restore people's livelihoods, and improve all public and private economies also lies here.

### Representatives of Various Ethnic Groups in Eastern Xinjiang Scheduled to Pay Respects to the Chairman

### Matters to Note for Exporting National Products to the United States

(Continued from page 1) All products containing salicylic acid or coumarin, such as dried plums, are absolutely prohibited. Products containing rotten or unclean substances cannot be exported. The wording of advertisements in newspapers should be simple and clear. If Chinese is used, it should be translated into English, and the two should be consistent, without additions or deletions. All untruthful or exaggerated and deceptive advertisements must be deleted. When a product is made of multiple materials, one major raw material must be selected for naming. For example, if the oyster sauce from a certain company contains more soy than oysters, then naming it oyster sauce is not accurate. Similarly, for the flower fish and fried dace of a certain company, the English translation is generally referred to as "fried fish," which is too broad. It should be directly translated as "flower fish or dace." The rest can be inferred by analogy. In short, the naming must be accurate. The weight must be accurate. Weight is divided into two types: liquid and solid. Liquid, such as water and oil, is calculated in pints, quarts, and gallons. Solid is calculated in pounds. The poundage stated on the label must be accurate. When a product is made of multiple materials, not only the name of the main material should be written, but also the other materials should be written separately, in order of quantity. The name and address of the manufacturer or packer must be clearly stated on the label. The source of the product must be clearly stated on the label, such as "Made in China" or "Made in Hong Kong." Canned food made in China often uses old cans. The method of making it is to put the food in the can first, leaving a small hole in the lid. After steaming to vent, the hole is sealed with tin. These types of canned food have not undergone sterilization methods, and there is often a feeling of bulging air inside. The United States believes that there are corrupt materials inside and often does not welcome them. As for new cans, the packaging should be made with machines and new scientific methods to suit the American health practices. Medicines are divided into two types: new and old. All raw medicines that were imported before 1938 are considered old medicines. If handling loose medicinal materials, they must be clean and free from insects. For newly invented medicines, a detailed explanation of the various substances contained and how to use them must be provided. If you want to sell these newly invented medicines in the United States, you must register in the United States in advance. When they arrive in the United States, they must be inspected and stamped by the Drug Administration before they can be sold. If the label of a medicine states that it can cure a certain disease, the medicine must indeed have the effect of curing that disease.

### Communist Party of China's Destruction of Catholicism is Directed by Moscow

In Remarks by a Bishop's Spokesperson

[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] According to reports from Catholic missionaries who have personally experienced the situation after returning from our country, the Chinese Communist Party is about to destroy Catholic churches in China. A spokesperson for the National Catholic Welfare Conference stated to reporters today: "The Chinese Communist Party is well aware that Catholicism is the single greatest bulwark against the greatest evil in the world today," 9= (Note: this greatest evil is Communism). The spokesperson, who had been preaching in the Central and North China regions for seven years, stated frankly: "From all the impressions and documents he has seen, it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party's policy of eradicating Catholic churches in North China is absolutely directed by Moscow."

[Central News Agency, New York, 6th, United Press] The grandfather of Father An Lianshan, editor of the American Catholic Jesuit magazine, met with reporters today and accused the CCP of currently killing American missionaries in areas of North China captured by the Communists.

### Aftermath of the Dayong Massacre Troublesome for Hunan Provincial Government

Investigating Officials Hesitate to Advance

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 7th] According to individuals from Dayong who have come to Changsha, after the newly appointed County Magistrate Huang Yingchuan and Secretary Cheng Mianzhi were killed on the 28th, order in Dayong was extremely chaotic for a time, and residents were plunged into terror. Gunfire was still heard on the 29th. The forensic examination by the Judicial Office did not begin until the afternoon of that day. Huang had a gunshot wound to the head. His leather shoes, top hat, and the legal tender he had on his person were all gone, leaving only a single layer of clothing. Cheng had a gunshot wound to the chest, his eyes wide open, covered in mud and blood, his state was extremely tragic. After the examination of the bodies was completed, the county government prepared thin coffins for temporary burial. The county police and self-defense forces rushed to build fortifications in the city, as if facing a formidable enemy. Rumors are spreading that if the provincial government exerts too much pressure, they will not hesitate to riot to resist. There are too many guns among the people in the county; almost every able-bodied man has one. They are already extremely terrified of being treated the same way as the county magistrate, and if the provincial government acts too aggressively, it may force them to take risks, gather a crowd, and rebel. The three officials dispatched to Dayong to thoroughly investigate are hesitant to advance, and the provincial government feels extremely troubled by this, with no plan for the aftermath. There are differing opinions in Changsha; the Hunan Daily advocates that the case be strictly handled together with the May Seventh Massacre of last year, which would be fair. The Zhongxing Daily attacks the former county magistrate, advocating strict handling of the murderers of Huang and the people behind them. The Central Daily News advocates resolving the dispute first, and then arresting the murderers.

### Arab League Considers Britain Concluding a Middle East Defense Agreement The Entire Issue of Libya's Independence is Raised Again

[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] The Council of the seven-nation Arab League is holding a ten-day meeting here today, and relations between Britain and Arab countries will be one of the topics of discussion. The Council will also consider signing a Middle East regional defense agreement between the Arab League and Britain, so that Arab countries do not have to sign agreements with Britain individually. It is generally expected that the League Council will try to formulate a positive policy towards Britain for the following reasons: ! The increasingly deteriorating relationship between the Eastern and Western blocs in Europe; the spread of Communism in the Middle East; developments after Iraq's rejection of the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty. However, political figures also believe that opinions within the Arab world are not yet consistent, so there is still doubt as to whether the Arab League can sign a regional defense agreement with Britain. If this proposal cannot be implemented, the Council may consider changing the League's charter to require member states to obtain the League's approval before negotiating with any major power. In addition, the Arab League will also consider the four major political issues of the Palestinian situation: the League's attitude after the arrival of the United Nations Palestine Committee in the Holy Land; the policy towards the Security Council's possible dispatch of international troops to the Holy Land; the future of the Palestinian Arab government; the status of Jews in various Arab countries. Other issues to be considered include the establishment of an air force base by the United States in Tripoli, the future of Libya, and the economic disputes between Syria and Lebanon after Syria's departure from the French Group.

[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] It is reported that Arab countries have individually submitted identical notes to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, demanding that the whole of Libya (Tripolitania and Cyrenaica) be made independent and opposing the establishment of trusteeship in the area.

### The Future of the Western European Alliance Still Has Many Obstacles Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg Hope to Link Up with the Pan-American Convention

[United Press, London, 7th] Foreign observers say that the increasing fear of the Soviet Union in European countries may prevent the Bevin Western European Alliance plan from being aborted. Although the British side has repeatedly emphasized that the Bevin plan is not aimed at the Soviet Union, the Nordic countries seem to have accepted Moscow's view that the Western European Alliance is aimed at the Soviet Union and is a step towards war. Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg seem to only allow participation on the condition that they have equal voting rights with Britain and France.

[Reuters, Sweden, 6th] Swedish Foreign Minister Unden declared today that Sweden is prepared to join the Western European Alliance, but only if the plan is based on the Marshall Plan, which Sweden can support, making cooperation in Western Europe its ten key objectives.

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Reliable sources say that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are taking a very reserved attitude towards the proposal by Britain and France to conclude a five-nation alliance in the manner of the Anglo-French alliance agreed upon in Dunkirk. The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have informally stated that they are not very willing to join any agreement aimed solely at Germany and have expressed the hope to expand any such alliance to establish a link with the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance signed in Rio de Janeiro on September 3, 1947. Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg believe that the idea of uniting Western Europe politically and economically must include West Germany, so concluding a defense treaty aimed at Germany is not sufficient to help the goal of the Western European Alliance and will be detrimental to it. As for Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg's advocacy of establishing a link with the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, it is because the three countries believe that any Western European organization will ultimately need the military assistance of the United States.

France Willing to Participate in Customs Union

French diplomatic figures here say that France has always supported allowing Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to participate in all discussions about Germany. Well-informed sources believe that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg will definitely be invited to participate in the Anglo-American-French three-nation meeting to be held in London on February 10. At the same time, France is currently discussing the possibility of establishing a customs union with Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. France has submitted a draft agreement on the Franco-Italian customs union to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. It is said that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have expressed great interest in this, but feel that its realization is still fraught with difficulties.

Foreign Secretary Bevin Reaffirms Assurance

[Reuters, London, 6th] Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech at the New Zealand Commemoration Dinner tonight, assuring that the British Commonwealth countries will support the proposal to organize a Western European Alliance. He said, "Western European countries have split into several small groups, and the concept of Western European countries is becoming narrower. We have now put forward a broader and more courageous policy. As we put forward this policy and develop this policy, Western European countries can know that the entire British Commonwealth will support this great effort aimed at promoting peace and security in the Old Continent."

### Cripps Says the Pound Will Not Be Devalued U.S. Loan Only Enough for One Month's Use

[Reuters, Edinburgh, 7th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps said today in an address to the Scottish Savings Committee meeting that the government currently has no intention of devaluing the pound. [Reuters, Washington, 6th] Britain continued to draw 100 million dollars from the United States loan today. Now, out of the total of 3.75 billion dollars loaned to Britain by the United States, only 100 million dollars remain. It is expected that the last 100 million dollars will be withdrawn at the beginning of next month, at which time the loan to Britain by the United States will be completely used up, which is eighteen months after the approval of the Anglo-American loan agreement, and at least one month before the implementation of the Marshall Plan. Financial experts here expect that if the Marshall Plan is not implemented by April 1 of this year, Britain will have to step up the sale of its gold reserves starting in early April.

### French Cabinet Approves Opening of Franco-Spanish Border to Proceed in Three Stages

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] The French cabinet approved today reopening the French-Spanish border in three stages.

After the third stage begins, the two countries will negotiate the conclusion of a commercial treaty. When the third stage will begin has not been announced. The Franco-Spanish border was closed by France for diplomatic reasons in February 1946, and negotiations for reopening began in September of last year, and an agreement was finally signed in Madrid on the 5th of this month.

### Bulgaria Encourages Jewish Immigration Britain Protests Strongly

[Reuters, London, 6th] Britain lodged its strongest protest with the Bulgarian government last Saturday over the continuous flow of illegal Jewish immigrants from Bulgarian Black Sea ports to Palestine. This was not announced until tonight. The British note pointed out that Britain had repeatedly warned Bulgaria about illegal Jewish immigrants leaving Bulgaria for Palestine, and added that the illegal Jewish immigrant ships "Fan York" and "Fan Classon" recently seized by the British Navy had set sail from the Bulgarian port of Burgas. The note pointed out that United Nations agencies have repeatedly appealed to countries to avoid any action that could further exacerbate the situation in Palestine at this critical juncture when Jewish-Arab relations are about to be strained. The note states that the British government believes that if Bulgaria has the sincerity to join the United Nations, it should familiarize itself with the activities of the United Nations agencies and the obligations that member states of the United Nations should fulfill. The note concludes by stating that the British government has concluded that the Bulgarian government is either deliberately encouraging illegal Jewish immigrants to leave Bulgaria for Palestine, or Bulgarian officials have committed serious mistakes.

### Disturbances Occur in Southern Korea Aimed at Forcing the Election Commission to Withdraw from Korean Territory Small General Assembly Scheduled to Discuss the Korean Issue

[United Press, Seoul, 7th] A number of incidents involving the sabotage of railways and power lines occurred in southern Korea today. According to the U.S. occupation authorities, the purpose was to force the United Nations Korean Election Monitoring Committee to withdraw from Korean territory. A train derailed about thirty miles east of Seoul, and a large number of leaflets were found throughout the area, calling for a general strike to demand the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet occupation forces, the confiscation and redistribution of land, the nationalization of industries, the release of political prisoners, and the return of power to the Korean people. The leaflets were not signed, and it is feared that left-wing elements are behind the scenes. General Hodge, commander of the U.S. occupation zone, has received two warnings that a three-day strike will be carried out to force the Monitoring Committee to withdraw. The authorities have now arrested 22 suspects.

[United Press, Lake Success, 6th] The United Nations Secretariat announced today that the Small General Assembly is scheduled to meet on the 24th, with the Korean issue as the first item on the agenda. The meeting was originally scheduled for the 23rd, but it was postponed by one day to avoid conflict with the celebration of Washington's Birthday.

### Arab Nations Firmly Oppose International Troops Entering the Holy Land Memorandum Submitted to United Nations Agencies

[United Press, Lake Success, 6th] The Arab Higher Committee today formally notified United Nations Secretary-General Lie, on behalf of the Palestinian Arabs, that the United Nations' attempt to partition Palestine will be regarded as an act of aggression. The pressure exerted by the U.S. delegation and the British government is all political intimidation. The Arabs firmly oppose the dispatch of any international troops to the Holy Land to implement the partition plan.

The Security Council has placed the Palestine issue on its provisional agenda and is scheduled to meet next Monday to discuss it.

[United Press, Damascus, 6th] After visiting the capitals of various Arab countries, Hussein, Vice Chairman of the Arab Supreme Committee, returned here tonight. It is said that if the United Nations uses an international guard force in Palestine to implement the partition plan, it will drive the armies of all Arab countries to engage in combat. When foreign troops enter Palestine, the pressure of public opinion will overthrow any Arab government that opposes sending regular troops. The entire Arab world has been thoroughly united and is deeply concerned about the Palestinian issue. Hussein is scheduled to go to Cairo tomorrow to attend the Arab League meeting.

### US Senate Schedules Debate on Marshall Plan Starting Next Month; Vandenberg Predicts Action Can Be Decided by the End of March

[US Information Service, Washington, 6th] The bill to provide US aid for the proposed European Recovery Program will be submitted to the Senate for discussion on March 1st. This was decided today by the Senate Republican Policy Committee, which is responsible for scheduling the introduction of various bills.

When announcing the date on which the case would be discussed in the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Taft predicted that the Senate would take final action before March 15th.

He has recently suffered from severe bronchitis and typhoid fever in prison, and doctors believe he urgently needs to be released for treatment.

### West Germany Establishes Federal Bank; British, American and French Negotiations Underway; Charter Is Not a Constitution, Only a Temporary Measure

[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] The new economic administration decree for the Anglo-American merged zone in West Germany, which was announced on the 6th, has granted the Germans in the merged zone broad authority to decide economic matters. The charter for the establishment of the West German Federal Bank, which has been postponed because the negotiations among Britain, the United States, and France have not yet concluded, is expected to be finalized with the support of the three powers.

Experts from the Anglo-American merged zone and the French zone are currently negotiating in Berlin to prepare for a meeting of representatives from Britain, the United States, and France in London on February 19th to discuss general issues in West Germany. British and American officials here strongly stated that the charter announced yesterday is only intended as a temporary measure, and will be replaced by other laws when a formal German government is established. British and American officials also stated that this charter should not be formally named a constitution, as it only stipulates economic matters. One official also pointed out that the most important "byproduct" of this reform is the Germans' heated discussion of whether this new reform has stipulated too much or too little centralism, which shows the awakening of democratic consciousness in West Germany.

### Results of Austrian Elections; Government Party Fails to Win a Majority of Seats

### Katayama Cabinet Shaken; Parties Compete for Power; Liberal Party and Democratic Party Both Plan to Form New Government

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] The impending political turmoil in Japan may not have any new developments, but the political parties are actively negotiating and moving behind the scenes. The Democratic Party, led by Foreign Minister Ashida, has always acted as an arbiter in the past, and now it will obviously still play the role of mediator. Ashida revealed a plan yesterday to exclude the extreme right and extreme left and gather the political forces of the centrists. This is quite surprising. It is heard that Shigeru Yoshida, the president of the right-wing Liberal Party, had a similar plan as early as two months ago, and has already won the support of some defectors from the Democratic Party. As for the Socialist Party, it seems that it would rather see the cabinet collapse than have a fatal split within the party. Under the current circumstances, if the current cabinet collapses one day, Katayama will probably have no successor. The chaos of the Japanese political party situation is unparalleled.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani declared after today's cabinet meeting that the Katayama cabinet will not collapse this weekend. Katayama now advocates transferring the government to the Liberal Party, the second largest party in the Diet, while the Democratic Party is busy recruiting party members in order to succeed the Socialist Party in forming a new government. Therefore, the crisis of the Japanese cabinet is no longer due to the issue of supplementary budget, but in fact due to the self-division of the government parties.

### Hull's Memoirs; Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance; Compiled by This Newspaper's Editorial Office

In early February 1940, the President said to me in the White House that he wanted to send Welles on a trip to the important capitals of Europe to see if there was any hope for peace. He asked me if I disapproved of this approach.

(Later, the President made it clear to me that Welles had secretly come to him several times, begging him to be allowed to go abroad on a special mission. Originally, Welles had asked the President to send him out in 1940. The President was only asking me if I objected to Welles' mission. For this reason, I felt quite satisfied.)

I immediately replied that if he really wanted to send Welles on a trip, I did not object. However, I said, I want to make a few points.

I reiterated a point of view that I had said to the President several times in recent weeks. I said, "The moment of war is almost upon us. The three Axis countries have established unprecedented military armaments. Hitler, Mussolini, and the spokesmen of Japan have shamelessly stated that they are determined to engage in limited conquest. They are firmly and unmistakably moving in this direction, straight as a bullet. This situation has occurred from 1933 to this year, after doing everything possible to promote peace within the limits of opposition from isolationists."

I continued, under these circumstances, the world is already on fire, and the Axis countries are ready and almost leaping forward with all their military forces. To talk about peace and visit the belligerent countries will inevitably cause false hopes. This false hope is particularly dangerous for countries and peoples who should be striving to prepare for self-defense; they should not be complacent about imagined geographical security or neutrality.

Continuing to play the tune of promptly achieving peace, the terrible effect of making a country's people linger in a false sense of security can be clearly illustrated by the popular song sung by British soldiers at the time, "We will hang our washing on the Siegfried Line." But I did feel that some terrible omen was brewing.

I also said that five hundred different rumors would inevitably arise about the purpose and results of Welles' trip. These rumors will cause confusion in Europe and at home.

In this stage of the war, I personally would not consider sending Welsh or anyone with a similar official status to Europe to assume such a task. Welles believed that even if the "Phony War" continued, it would still be impossible to find some basis for peace. But Hitler was obviously frantically preparing to end the "Phony War" in his only way, which is all-out intense combat, and the only way to stop him from preparing in this way is to give him everything he asks for. But this is equivalent to Nazi control of Europe, and another war will happen within a few years.

On February 9, the President himself announced Welles' mission, saying that at the President's request, Welles would visit Italy, France, Germany, and Britain, with the sole purpose of providing the President and me with opinions on the current situation in Europe. However, the President had the meaning I had proposed in mind, so he emphasized that Welles had no power to make suggestions or decisions on behalf of the US government. Any statements made to him by officials of other governments must be kept strictly confidential and can only be conveyed to him and me by Welles.

On the same day, I announced that we had begun informal negotiations with other neutral governments. I explained that these negotiations were a preliminary exploration of a sound international economic system and universal disarmament in the world. The current war situation is not involved, but belligerent countries can also be included, because these dialogues involve two common issues for the future peace.

At that time, we had launched a plan to formulate the form of a postwar world as much as possible, in order to propose it to other countries and our own people. These talks are a part of this exploration and research work.

As far as I know, the announcement of Welles' mission caused many rumors. Although the President emphasized that the delegation should not make any decisions, many isolationists took this opportunity to cause an uproar, claiming that we were about to be drawn into European disputes. Others were equally convinced that Welles must have a definite mission, which is to achieve peace in Europe at any cost by the Allied countries or ourselves. Still others speculated that there were differences of opinion between the President and me, and between Welles and me. In order to quell these rumors, I issued a statement on February 14, saying:

"I think the President and I are almost as consistent in our foreign policy and methods as any two people holding the same positions. After our discussions and meetings, first the President announced the special delegation to Europe, and then I myself announced the issues related to postwar economic recovery and disarmament. There was nothing abnormal happening at the time."

Afterwards, I expressed my compliments to Welles, expressing my appreciation.

Accompanied by Jay Pierrepont Moffat, the director of the European Division of the State Department, Welles visited Rome, Berlin, Paris, and London. He saw the leaders of every government and Pope Pius XII, and talked to them in detail. He gave them a memorandum on our economic policy centered on the trade agreement plan, which we hope to adopt after the war. He received from them lengthy opinions on the war, defending themselves in every way.

Although he kept his promise to the President, that is, to keep everything he was told strictly confidential, rumors always followed and were rife. These rumors filled the Allied countries and small neutral countries with terror, fearing that the President would take peace action after Welles returned, and this action would inevitably recognize most of Hitler's gains and make another war unavoidable. As a result, the President and I agreed that he would give a speech to try to dispel this fear. Therefore, Mr. Roosevelt delivered a speech from the White House to the Conference of Foreign Workers of Christian Churches on March 16:

"Today, we are looking for a moral basis for peace. If brotherly love cannot be understood, there can be no true peace. If the result of peace is oppression, or hunger, or cruelty, or human life is controlled by armed camps, there can be no lasting peace. If small countries must live in fear of strong powers, there can be no sound peace. If the freedom from aggression is sold out as a sacrifice, there can be no moral peace. If the free exchange of ideas is denied, making it impossible for human beings to reach a common position, there can be no rational peace. If the right to worship God is denied, there is no righteous peace."

To further eliminate these dangerous rumors, I sent a memorandum to the President on March 18, with a draft telegram that I intended to send to Welles, who was in Rome at the time, "urging him to be particularly cautious." The President wrote "OKFDR" on the memorandum in pencil. On the same day, I sent a telegram to Welles, saying that I had made it clear to the press that his mission was purely of a fact-finding nature, that he could not assume the role of mediator between one belligerent country and another, or participate in any negotiations, and that he could not imagine that he could express opinions or take action on any peace proposals based on the threat of force or any ultimatum with a time limit. I believed that he could not receive any peace terms other than providing us with information. Before leaving Rome, Welles issued a statement to the press, stating that he had not received or transmitted any peace proposals and that his mission was only to collect information.

On March 20, British Ambassador Lothian came to see me and expressed his gratitude to the President and me for what he considered to be timely action to prevent and dispel the spread of the sentiment of "seeking peace at any cost." According to him, this sentiment stemmed from various rumors about Welles possibly creating a peace negotiated in Europe, and such a peace would be tantamount to a German victory. He said that any effort to achieve peace through negotiations might undermine the war efforts of Britain and France. I made it clear that in recent weeks we had never neglected the most minute aspects of the entire issue and were prepared to express our position clearly at the appropriate time.

When Welles returned to Washington at the end of March, he presented a very complete report to the President and me on his conversations with Mussolini, Hitler, Daladier, Chamberlain, the Pope, and their foreign ministers. Probably no one could have gleaned more information from them, but the information he obtained did not give us any basis for action. The leaders he had spoken with did not give him any hope of peace. The President issued a statement on March 29, stating that while there was little prospect of any fair peace at present, the information collected by Welles was undoubtedly of the greatest value and would be useful when the opportunity to establish peace arrived in the future. But based on the proof of later facts, even this statement was too optimistic. The opportunity for peace did not come for more than five years, and when it came, the figures who led the British, German, and Italian governments in 1940 had died, and the head of the French government at that time was no longer in office.

Regarding the amount of storage, it is stipulated that non-commercial individuals or merchants not engaged in the industry, except for those who directly consume the paper, such as associations, magazines, and printing houses, shall not purchase and store newsprint and rough-edged paper unless necessary. The storage quantity of direct consumers shall be reported to the same industry association for submission to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification at any time. Merchants engaged in the industry may purchase and store a quantity of newsprint and rough-edged paper up to one-quarter of their total sales volume in 1947; otherwise, it shall be treated as hoarding. Newsprint purchased with self-provided foreign exchange shall not be restricted, but it shall be reported to the same industry association for submission to the Social Affairs Bureau for record, and then sold on the market. Those who act as agents to introduce sales and purchases and store paper in disguised names without a genuine owner of the goods shall be treated as hoarding regardless of the amount of goods hoarded once discovered. C. The price of sales on the market: For paper that should be sold within the limit or sold on the market, a negotiated price system shall be adopted. The Shanghai Paper Business Association shall organize a valuation team to negotiate prices at any time, submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and public announcement, and then implement them. If transactions exceed the negotiated price, penalties shall be imposed according to the provisions of Article 18 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times and the Regulations on Cracking Down on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices, depending on the severity of the circumstances.

### Financial Bureau Advocates Lenient Handling of Confiscated Silver

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of whether privately held silver confiscated by the National Bank can be returned, this reporter inquired with Director Li Lixia, who stated: "The official correspondence from the Ministry of Finance to the Financial Management Bureau does not instruct for immediate return, but rather to first investigate whether there was any black market trading activity before determining a course of action. However, the existence of this correspondence implies room for negotiation. Zhou Yizhi, the lawyer hired by the parties involved, has repeatedly consulted with the Bureau, and is currently discussing with the guild in hopes of presenting some compelling evidence to prove that there was no trading activity." Li also expressed his personal opinion, saying: "The parties involved may have engaged in black market gold and currency trading in the past, but today the people are suffering deeply, so I personally advocate for lenient handling."

### Compensation Goods Arriving from Japan to be Unpacked After Lunar New Year

[Report from Our Newspaper] The civilian portion of the Japanese compensation goods that have arrived in the city are currently stored in the No. 7 warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau, under the custody of the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office. The office has scheduled a viewing for relevant parties within a week after the Lunar New Year, and an unpacking ceremony will be held on-site. The list of compensation items for private industrial use was scheduled to be delivered to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office here by the Ministry of Economic Affairs last week, but has not yet been received as of this writing. Factories in the city requesting allocation of these goods, mostly large factories, are applying directly to the Ministry, while small factories are unclear about the procedures and are submitting applications through the Guidance Office. According to relevant personnel, three textile machinery companies, based on their scale and history, have a strong chance of being allocated goods. These three companies are the China Textile Machinery Company of Shanghai, the Jingwei Textile Machinery Company, and a certain textile machinery manufacturing plant in Guangxi. In the past, the Ministry originally intended to allocate 500 Japanese compensation textile machines to each company, but although the situation has changed and the original plan cannot be implemented, allocation remains a priority.

The main defendant Liu Jixin and others did not appear.

### Grain Merchants' Handling Fee for Allotment of Rationed Rice Set at 5%; Bonus for Absence of Deductions

### Continued Hearing in High-Ranking Executive Yuan Official Embezzlement Case; Director of Investigation Provides Important Testimony: Points Out Many Measures Did Not Conform to Regulations

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Criminal Court of the District Court continued to hear the case of high-ranking Executive Yuan officials accused of embezzlement yesterday, from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. As a result, each defendant remained on their original bail, and the witnesses were dismissed. After Judge Huang Guangyu took the bench in Criminal Court One, he ordered each defendant to appear in court. Those who reported yesterday included Hou Aichang, Dong Chengdao, Hu Keshi, Jiang Renlin, Pang Yuanlong, Du Cen, and Deng Zhonghe. The defendants Commissioner Huo Yongzhang, Chen Choumin, Lu Jiaju, Section Chief Tao Jingzhen, and contractor Ding Tiansheng did not appear. The witnesses who appeared included Gao Qingxiao, Director of the Investigation Department of the Executive Yuan, Tang Xinghui, General Manager of Qingfeng Yarn Factory, Rong Yixin, Manager of Shenxin No. 3 Factory, Ni Keding, Commissioner of the Executive Yuan, Huang Weiqing, Section Chief, and Zhang Zihui. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of Zhongfang, sent a representative to the court. The main defendant Hou Aichang's testimony mostly consisted of "I don't know" or "I'm not clear." The testimony of Gao Qingxiao, Director of the Investigation Department, is extremely relevant to the future development of the case. A summary of the main points of his testimony is as follows: After the embezzlement case involving high-ranking Executive Yuan officials occurred, the Executive Yuan sent Gao to investigate the inside story. Gao conducted a separate investigation into the welfare embezzlement and electric fan allocation embezzlement, while Gao and Hu Yuyin jointly investigated the cotton-for-yarn embezzlement. Gao then stated seven points: When Jiang Renlin was the Chief of the Welfare Section, he unauthorizedly misappropriated US$500 from the Section's reserve fund. The investigation revealed that this reserve fund was intended to cover the cost of lodging for returning staff from the rear area. The misappropriation to repair houses was highly inappropriate.

Acceptance of Furniture, Unknown Whereabouts

The Executive Yuan staff dormitory in Ruifeng Lane initially contained a large amount of valuable furniture. Subsequently, the furniture disappeared, leaving only broken equipment. The Executive Yuan stipulated that any public funds exceeding 5 million yuan must be approved before being used, and that only registered construction companies were eligible to bid. The repair of the dormitory and the purchase of furniture cost over US$2,000, which was not legally approved, and the contractor Ding Tiansheng, introduced by Commissioner Huo Yongzhang, was not registered and was not a formal businessman, which was illegal. The prices of the furniture purchased exceeded the market prices at the time. According to the regulations of the Audit Office, the purchase of goods must be subject to bidding and comparison, but the purchase of this furniture was not subject to bidding and comparison. The procedures were also incomplete. The dormitory had electrical appliances and refrigerators, but they were not part of the Executive Yuan's furniture.

Electric Fan Allocation, Numbers Do Not Match

Regarding the electric fan allocation issue, according to the Executive Yuan regulations, staff members were not allowed to purchase relief supplies. According to Gao's investigation, Peng Wu荒 had privately stockpiled more than 30 units. He had reported this. After that, as far as he knew, the electric fans had gone through three stages: secret sale, suspension of allocation, and public sale. The announced numbers also did not match the actual numbers. Regarding the cotton-for-yarn exchange ratio, the accounts can be verified, and it can be determined who suffered losses and who profited with a single check. After Gao completed his statement, other witnesses made their statements. At approximately 6:00 PM, the court determined that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing to a later date.

### Xu Case: Lawyer Xi Bingxi Visits District Court to Review Case Files

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zheng Zhongwei, Chief of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters, accompanied lawyer Xi Bingxi, who is handling the extradition case of Xu Jizhuang, to visit Cha Liangjian, President of the District Court, at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The meeting lasted approximately one hour. It is reported that Hong Kong authorities will bring Xu before the court again on the 18th of this month to determine whether or not to extradite him. Zheng and Xi visited President Cha yesterday to request access to Xu's case files to collect evidence in order to argue their case on the 18th. President Cha expressed his willingness to assist and approved access to Xu's case files. Afterwards, this reporter interviewed Zheng Zhongwei, who stated: the extradition of Xu Jizhuang is being handled in accordance with Article 21 of the 1858 Anglo-Chinese Treaty of Tianjin. Lawyer Xi will return to Hong Kong after collecting the evidence, and will request the Hong Kong authorities to extradite Xu on the 18th so that he can be brought to justice.

### Flying Tigers Team to Undergo Transformation; China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) Oppose and Protest to Government

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the end of the Civil Air Transport (CAT) team led by Chennault, there are external reports that it will be reorganized into a semi-official civil aviation company under government control. It is understood that China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) are strongly opposed to this and have lodged an unofficial protest to the government. The persons in charge of the two companies are extremely indignant about the various privileges obtained by the Civil Air Transport team under the pretext of transporting relief supplies. For example: China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) have to pay a 50% import tax on the aircraft fuel they purchase, while the Civil Air Transport team is exempt from taxes because it is a relief organization. The Civil Air Transport team obtains far more public exchange at official prices than China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), so it can purchase more flight equipment from abroad and the delivery is very fast because it has priority. However, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) often have to wait for several months before receiving their orders. Hongqiao Airport in this city is an air force airport and has never been allowed for use by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), but the Civil Air Transport team's aircraft can take off and land at the airport. China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) have to pay part of their operating income to maintain the Civil Aviation Administration, but the Civil Air Transport team does not have to pay. The Civil Aviation Administration prohibits China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) from flying at night, but it has no right to prohibit the Civil Air Transport team, so the Civil Air Transport team can fly day and night, and the goods and passengers it transports are twice as much as its capacity. Under these circumstances, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) are at a very disadvantageous competitive position, so they are resolutely opposed to the Civil Air Transport team being reorganized into a civil aviation company.

[Another Report] According to a source from the Ministry of Transportation, the government has decided to grant the team permission to temporarily exist for one year. After the Executive Yuan has completed the conclusion the matters of its affiliation and the various issues related to air transport that it will handle during this year are currently being planned and requested of higher authorities.

### Anhui Native Place Relief Association First Transfers One Billion to Each of Three Districts to Aid Disaster Victims

Yang Hufang Zhizhi, Chairman of the Anhui Native Place Relief Association in Shanghai, stated that because 59 counties in Anhui Province had suffered from banditry and disaster, and that the displaced victims were in dire straits, that he had joined with Xu Shiying and others from the Anhui Native Place Association in Beijing to form the Anhui Disaster Relief and Reconstruction Committee to raise funds from all sectors of Shanghai. Following solicitations of funds from various parties that have been recognized that achievements have been made, one billion yuan was first transferred to each of the three districts of Anqing, Beng埠, and Wuhu in order to distribute relief to the affected areas. As for refugees in Shanghai, the Association has already disbursed over 400 million yuan for emergency relief. In addition to the 200 million yuan allocated by the Anhui Provincial Government, the remaining shortfall will be paid from the Anhui disaster relief funds.

### A Miracle in Medical History: Infant with Record Number of Digits; Healthy Development, Otherwise No Different

[Report from Our Newspaper] Le Li, a young mother at the Municipal Second Hospital, gave birth to a boy a week ago. His development is healthy and normal, but he has six fingers on his left hand, seven fingers on his right hand, nine toes on his left foot, and ten toes on his right foot, for a total of 32 digits on his hands and feet. (See picture. Photo by this newspaper.) This sets a record for polydactyly in medical history. After a thorough examination, there were no special abnormalities in the child's various body parts and internal organs, and the pregnancy and delivery were smooth. Dr. Zeng Zhong, the hospital director, and Dr. Li Bingxian, the director of obstetrics and gynecology, are extremely interested in this infant and have already filmed him for medical research. According to the research results of physicians in various departments of the hospital, it is believed that once the child is a little older, the extra digits can be completely removed, making him no different from ordinary people. The hospital is willing to serve as a long-term medical consultant for the mother and child to ensure their continued health.

### Fifth Session of Municipal Council Postponed to 23rd; Zhang Yiqu and Others Request Formation of Resolution Review Committee

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fifth Session of the First Municipal Council of this city has now been postponed for one week and will be convened on February 23. The registration date for councilors has also been extended to February 16. The draft agenda for this session has been prepared by the Council Secretariat and is as follows: February 23 morning will be the opening ceremony and the mayor's policy report; February 24 afternoon will be the work reports and question-and-answer sessions for the directors of the Finance, Education, and Land Administration Bureaus; February 25 afternoon will be the work reports and question-and-answer sessions for the directors of the Health, Public Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus; February 27 and 28 will be committee review meetings; February 29 is a day of rest; March 1 to 4, from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM each afternoon, will be for discussion of proposals. The session is scheduled to last for 11 days, and will adjourn at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of March 4.

The Council Secretariat has already begun to receive proposals from councilors, but the number of proposals is still small. Among them is a proposal from Zhang Yiqu, He Chengfu, Jiang Jiju, Zhao Junhao, and others to form a "Resolution Review Committee" to review the implementation of the resolutions of the previous four sessions of the Council, so as to remedy any deficiencies. It is claimed that among the hundreds of resolutions passed by the Council, those that have been implemented are mostly cases that increase the burden on the people, while cases that alleviate the people's suffering and those related to municipal affairs and reform are often delayed and shirked, and ultimately shelved. It is necessary for the Council to clarify and remedy whether the administrative agencies are faithfully implementing the resolutions. The tasks of the Review Committee are: to count the ratio of resolutions of the Council that have been implemented to those that have not been implemented; to examine the progress of the implementation of the various resolutions of the Council; to review the reasons for the non-implementation of the non-implemented parts of the resolutions, and whether those reasons are justified; to prepare a statistical table of the review results and provide opinions and suggestions to be submitted to the next session for a general review.

### Health Bureau Laundry Center; Director and Accountant Suspected of Embezzlement

[Report from Our Newspaper] Fu Tongshun, Director of the Health Bureau Laundry Center, and Qin Ruzheng, Accountant, are suspected of embezzlement. Yesterday, the Health Bureau transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation, and Fu and Qin were temporarily detained. The Health Bureau Laundry Center used to wash clothes for municipal government officials and had a considerable income, which was usually self-sufficient. However, at the end of last year, the Director of the Center, Fu Tongshun, colluded with the Accountant, Qin Ruzheng, to report losses to the Health Bureau and request subsidies. The municipal government sent Accounting Director Liu Rucong and Secretary Zheng Bo to investigate and found evidence of embezzlement. The Health Bureau sent a letter along with the two defendants to the District Procuratorate for trial.

Approximately 1,000 mu of land used by the Naval Machinery School and Jiangnan Shipyard should be returned to civilian use, except for the part originally used by the naval machinery and the part that Jiangnan Shipyard is preparing to expropriate.

### Ten Domestic Films Win Awards; Cultural Movement Committee Announces Awards Ceremony to be Held on the 15th of this Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee invited representatives from various film companies to the 14th floor of the International Hotel to announce the process and results of the 36th Annual Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Award for Film. The event began with reports from Committee Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Vice Chairman Liu Wen, who stated: The Cultural Movement Committee held three Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Award competitions last year: Chinese Opera, Fine Arts, and Film. The film competition involved representative works from eleven film companies, totaling 22 films, which were screened daily at the Cultural Hall starting October 23 of last year. The committee invited more than 300 people to participate in the selection, including film and theater professionals, university professors, and heads of various agencies. The selection process was based on five categories: screenwriting, directing, acting, cinematography, and other. Participants scored each category, and the scores were then tallied. The results were the selection of ten films: "The Spring River Flows East" (Kun Lun Production, 91.22 points); "Nepotism" (Cathay Production, 83.46 points); "Mother and Son" (Wenhua Production, 83.37 points); "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon" (Lianhua Production, 83.35 points); "Distant Love" (China Film Production, 81.64 points); "Where Is My Husband?" (Da Zhonghua Production, 81.43 points); "Spring Dream End" (China Enterprise Film Arts Society Production, 81.08 points); "Tian Zi Number One" (China Film Production, 81.07 points); "China's Resistance" (China Film Sichuan Production, 80.36 points); "On the Songhua River" (Changchun Production, 80.1 points). In addition, the Cathay Production film "Masked Woman" had the same score as "On the Songhua River." However, because Cathay already had "Nepotism" selected, the committee ultimately decided to select Changchun's "On the Songhua River" in order to ensure a widespread and fair opportunity to win awards.

Golden Medals, Splendid and Exquisite

The 22 films participating in the selection were all produced by various companies before the Double Tenth Festival last year. There were many other good films at the end of last year, but because they were not eligible to participate, they will be included in this year's selection. As for the ten winning films, the committee has produced two sizes of round gold medals: ten large ones, which will be given to the production companies of the winning films, and smaller ones, which will be given to the directors, main actors, music, set design, and recording personnel of the winning films. The number of award recipients for each film will not exceed ten. Both types of medals are engraved with the words "Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Award for the 36th Annual Film Award" and "Presented by the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee." They are glittering gold, splendid and exquisite. The awards ceremony is scheduled to be held on the Theater Festival on the 15th of this month at the Tianchan Theater. The next afternoon, the committee will invite all the award recipients and other theater professionals to hold a grand annual observation and performance.

Efforts in Research, Striving for Excellence

The representatives of the film companies, Xu Suqing and Tao Fangdi, gave speeches. Xu expressed gratitude for the awards and encouragement given to the film industry by the Cultural Movement Committee. Tao stated that the biggest goal of the private film industry in the future will be to develop overseas markets, especially in Southeast Asia, in order to help overseas Chinese understand the domestic situation. Chairman Pan then expressed three hopes to the film industry from the standpoint of the cultural world: that the film industry will work hard to research and strive for excellence so that the art of domestic films can reach international standards; that the film industry should enrich the consciousness of the films themselves so that the audience can receive enlightenment on active construction; the current funding for the Cultural Movement Committee depends on donations from the Pingju actors and actresses from the past. The funding is limited, and there are many things to be done. In order to prevent the cultural movement from being interrupted, it is hoped that the film industry can also respond to donations. Finally, Pan also stated that in the future, the award selection will be expanded to all cultural work. For example, the committee also plans to continue to hold important news selections for the press this year, and will reward the hard-working journalists by selecting and rewarding the best articles based on the significance, thoroughness, and writing of the news.

### Overseas Chinese in the Netherlands: Qingtian, Rui'an, and Bao'an Form a Triumvirate: Fourth Letter from Our Correspondent in the Netherlands, Mao Shu Qing

[The Hague, February 2nd Airmail] Overseas Chinese have two major bases: the South Sea Islands and North America. I have never been to the South Seas in my life. When I was in the United States a few years ago, I had nothing but admiration for the Chinese who pioneered and established themselves, and who have now built homes and businesses. Besides this, the Netherlands is probably next. The Chinese in the Netherlands have a foundation, methods, and ambition. In the European Chinese community, the Netherlands should be a region of considerable importance.

There are roughly a thousand or so Chinese in the Netherlands. The counties of Qingtian and Rui'an in Zhejiang, and Bao'an in Guangdong, represent a "triumvirate" in terms of numbers. The election of European regional representatives to the Legislative Yuan was very enthusiastic in the Netherlands. The three candidates happened to come from three different regions. Hometown ties can sometimes lead to mutual assistance and exchange, but if they are all for elections, deepening the divide between each other is also a drawback.

### Refused to Sail to Enemy Country Laden with Large Quantities of Armaments

Overseas Chinese are all patriotic. When overseas Chinese chat, they often long for the warmth of their motherland. During the war, the Chinese in the Netherlands, like overseas Chinese in many other countries, donated money and offered contributions, sending them back to their homeland one after another. A Guangdong man named Zhang Ban Ying was working on a sea vessel at the beginning of the war. Once, a German transport ship was loaded with a large quantity of armaments, ready to set sail directly for Japan. Zhang Zhen Ying led the Chinese "seamen" in a strike at the Rotterdam docks. I heard that this incident later reached the headquarters of the Nazi occupying forces, who wanted to arrest the leaders of the strike. Now, Mr. Zhang Zhen Ying has long since gone to China.

During the war, there were many moving stories, but also many interesting anecdotes over tea. The Nazi army occupied the Netherlands for five years. At that time, transportation was cut off, and there was a severe food shortage in the Netherlands. They used corn, potatoes, and other mixed grains to fill their stomachs. This taste was, of course, "inedible." I heard that a Chinese man named Lin had a noodle-making machine, which was the only one in the entire Netherlands at the time. Every day, he ground the mixed grains into flour and then made them into noodles for sale, thus making a fortune. A restaurant owner in The Hague told me: "Others also wanted to make this lucrative business, but the mixed grain flour was too hard. Without a machine, it was impossible to turn it into noodles by hand!"

### Number One in Chinese Cuisine: Competing with Foreigners for Food

Now, there are many noodle-making machines in the Netherlands, as well as dozens of Chinese restaurants of all sizes. From what I remember, there are probably nine in The Hague, ten in Amsterdam, and three in Rotterdam. The large restaurants are decorated luxuriously, comparable only to the Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, USA. Each restaurant's daily turnover ranges from as much as two thousand to as little as five hundred (equivalent to two hundred to five hundred US dollars), which is quite considerable. They rely on gifts and shipments from relatives and friends, from as far as South Africa, Singapore, and Australia, to as near as England and Denmark. Traveling the world, no cuisine surpasses Chinese cuisine. Our hardworking overseas Chinese rely on this "national essence" to compete with foreigners for food.

### A Few Chinese Merchants Are Raising Prices in Violation of Government Regulations

In addition, many overseas Chinese in the Netherlands are engaged in the cotton textile business. Overseas Chinese purchase cotton textiles wholesale from textile factories and then retail them to users. In Arnheum, I attended a New Year's dinner for cotton textile merchants. After the meal, a Dutch police officer who was invited told us that a few Chinese merchants were raising retail prices in violation of government price controls. The Dutch friend also mentioned that many Chinese overseas Chinese in the Netherlands were "selling candy," which seemed very "indecent." Perhaps he meant well and was offering sincere advice, but hearing it suddenly was very jarring. After the meal, we had a small conversation. First Secretary Si Song Xi of the embassy, in addition to analyzing the actual difficulties faced by overseas Chinese in the cotton textile business, also told him: "China now has the largest textile scale in the world, which is the China Textile Company. In the future, when transportation becomes more convenient, perhaps one day, Dutch cotton textile merchants will have to go to China to place orders." Secretary Si Song Xi also advised them to leave more room for feeling for the Chinese people, and there will always be good results in the future!

I once asked Mr. Yu Zhong, the chairman of the Cotton Textile Industry Association, and he believes that the greatest pain for overseas Chinese cotton textile merchants is the inability to obtain goods from factories, and even if they do, it is not enough. As a result, retailers, in desperation, resort to the black market, exceeding the "price limit." Since the purchase price exceeds the price limit, retail is naturally considered a "black market" by the Dutch government. Therefore, how to enable the factory to increase the wholesale quantity for Chinese overseas Chinese is the crux of the whole problem.

### Lu Chunyang's Treasure Box: A Flourishing Candy Selling Career

Consul Ding Zhen Wu stationed in Amsterdam, also explained the causes and consequences of the so-called "selling candy" problem that day. I remember: In the twilight light, I often encountered those overseas Chinese who carried wooden boxes like "Lu Chunyang's" herbal medicine box. "Rely on the mountain to eat from the mountain, rely on the water to eat from the water" describes these hard-working overseas Chinese.

In the overseas Chinese community in the Netherlands, at least, there is now a kind of self-awareness: eating is certainly important, but striving for the dignity of the country is even more important. The idea of ​​"stopping selling candy" is circulating among many overseas Chinese leaders. Another strange phenomenon is that The Hague and Amsterdam both suffer from a "labor shortage," and Chinese restaurants cannot recruit Chinese waiters. A restaurant owner told me: "A waiter makes forty guilders a week, and at most earns one hundred and sixty guilders a month. If a candy seller has good business, he can earn one hundred guilders on a Sunday." He added: "Don't underestimate the candy sellers, ah. When they go home, they change their clothes, put down Lu Chunyang's treasure box, and everyone dresses up beautifully!"

### Complex Social Environment and Low Educational Level

I haven't studied this issue in detail, but I know that the overseas Chinese community sometimes has unexpectedly complex situations and environments. Moreover, because the educational level of European overseas Chinese is generally lower than that of the United States, and the "official price," "private price," and "price limit" of Europe are particularly complicated, today Zhang San was "arrested and taken to the government" for selling at a high price, and tomorrow Li Si's five dan of white rice were suddenly confiscated... All of this has been happening all over Europe in the two years since the war. Some overseas Chinese say that diplomats don't do anything. The consulate says that overseas Chinese don't understand the laws of the host country, the language is not clear, and plus the consulate doesn't have that much manpower and financial resources to be able to negotiate every case smoothly.

In Europe, the situation in the Netherlands is relatively good in this regard. But because there are many overseas Chinese, one consulate is quite busy. The United States, France, and Belgium all have consulates in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and the United States also has a consulate general. If we can open a consulate in Rotterdam, or expand the consulate in Amsterdam into a consulate general, in terms of organization and manpower, we will naturally be able to serve the overseas Chinese better. In addition, if the remittance limit for overseas Chinese can be increased with the consent of the Dutch government, it will benefit the national economy and people's livelihood. I suggest that the Bank of China should establish a small organization in the Netherlands to handle the remittances of one thousand overseas Chinese. I wrote about this idea in the "World Daily" in Chongqing when I first traveled to the Netherlands in 1945. This time I come, I still have the same feeling.

When General Jiang Dingwen came to the Netherlands, he sincerely persuaded the overseas Chinese to abstain from smoking and gambling. In fact, overseas Chinese in the Netherlands are relatively few in this regard, especially in The Hague, it can be said that there are absolutely none. A young overseas Chinese leader in Amsterdam advocates that the "Overseas Chinese Federation" should establish * clubs to encourage playing chess, Beijing opera, or playing billiards, etc., to replace gambling. This is a very positive idea. The Overseas Chinese Federation is a large union of overseas Chinese in the Netherlands. The current president is Mr. Ma Wenshan, an overseas Chinese from Shandong.

### The Next Generation of Chinese People: No Opportunity to Learn Chinese

I talked to Mr. Ma Wenshan about the issue of "overseas Chinese education." Unfortunately, there is currently no Chinese school in the entire Netherlands. Many "next-generation Chinese people" have no opportunity to learn Chinese. According to Mr. Ma Wenshan's view, if the country can send people to the Netherlands to run the school, fundraising will not be a big problem. An overseas Chinese in Rotterdam, Nang Hua, said: Last year, a British student named Liu, from Sichuan, took the initiative to come to the Netherlands to establish a school, and promised that he himself would be responsible. The overseas Chinese in Rotterdam were extremely excited. Funding, school buildings, and foundations were all prepared, but Mr. Liu suddenly rushed back to London, and from then on, there was no news, and the school was abandoned invisibly.

### Dutch Children, Police, Guns, and Axes: Harm Overseas Chinese

Overseas Chinese education affects all actions of the overseas Chinese community. In the Netherlands, there are still not many people who can truly read newspapers and know the major events of the country, except for a few overseas Chinese leaders. Before and after the war, many overseas Chinese suffered unwarranted disasters because they "understood" too little. I heard that an overseas Chinese in The Hague was pushed into the water and drowned before the end of the war. In the town of Hevferson near Prince Bernat's palace, Jiang Guanghe, a Zhejiang overseas Chinese selling candy, was beaten to death with an axe by three underage Dutch children, and all the cash was robbed. Another overseas Chinese named Zhang Yueliang, who lived in the city of Utrecht, was shot in the thigh with a pistol by a thug claiming to be a Dutch plainclothes policeman, and later died in the hospital. Stories like this were particularly common before and after the end of the war, when the situation was chaotic.

I heard that before the German army withdrew from the Netherlands, overseas Chinese in the Netherlands were able to live relatively peacefully. It is rumored that General Fugenhausen, who had once been to China, when he served as the commander-in-chief of the German army stationed on the coast of the Netherlands and Belgium, had repeatedly ordered the protection of the lives and property of overseas Chinese. It is also said that an overseas Chinese named Chen, who lived in the city of Saint Dam (near Amsterdam), married a Jewish woman as his wife and had two sons. During the German occupation of the Netherlands, all Jews were killed without exception, but the Jewish wife of this Chen was spared.

At that time, overseas Chinese in the Netherlands had an organization called the "Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Association." All Chinese overseas Chinese were powerful workers in resisting fascism. After the surrender of Germany and Japan in 1945. The Dutch overseas Chinese's celebration of victory "dragon lantern parade" is a glorious page in European history. The Dutch overseas Chinese have ambition. All overseas Chinese in the Netherlands love the country, love the nation, and love the leader. I wish them good health! (At the Harrison Hotel)

### Baoshan Coal Mine Resumes Production

[Report from Suzhou, February 6th] The Baoshan Coal Mine strike has now returned to normal. According to the West Mountain Baoshan Coal Mine Company, after the victory, Liu Guangzhong was originally responsible for organizing a resumption committee to continue mining. Because Liu was accused of other cases and detained in Hangzhou, the mine was in a chaotic state, and all the workshops were completely shut down. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is concerned about the livelihood of the employees, and has ordered the coal mine industry union to maintain itself, resume production, and designate the chairman of the association, Xu Ai Bao, to preside. The association immediately invited General Ge Tian to be a senior consultant. Ge is the dean of the Retired Soldiers Training Institute and is experienced in industrial and mining affairs. After taking office, he advocated employee cooperation, and the output increased daily, with about ten tons of coal produced per day.

### Yao Mingzhuo Arrested and Enlisted: Jingjiang Military Service Association Committee Resigns

[Report from Jingjiang, February 7th] All members of the Military Service Association resigned because the resolutions were not implemented, leading to the incident of General Affairs Section Chief Yao Mingzhuo being arrested and enlisted in the military. It is now learned that the committee jointly sent a letter to the county resigning. According to reports, this county was ordered to conscript soldiers, but it did not follow legal procedures. The Lu Guoxing and Lu Guoyin brothers were both conscripted. Their father requested the Military Service Association to release one of them. The association resolved to comply and sent General Affairs Section Chief Yao Mingzhuo to the county government to negotiate with Section Chief Cao Zheng Hong of the Military Affairs Section. There was a slight conflict of words, and before he knew it, Yao Mingzhuo was arrested, sent to the receiving troops, and enlisted as a new recruit. The speaker of the county council and chairman of the Military Service Association, Sheng Yi Bai, went to negotiate and ordered him to write a letter of repentance before he was released. Now, unfortunately, the issue of resignation has arisen.

### Pingyang Nanhuan Sluice Gate Completed

[Report from Pingyang, February 2nd] The Xiaguo Bridge in Nanhuan District and the Nanhuan Sluice Gate in Beigang District of this county are large-scale water conservancy projects in this province. The Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan allocated relief funds in April last year to organize the North-South Port Water Conservancy Project Office, with the Commissioner of the Eighth District, Yu Senwen, concurrently serving as the director. The project was put out to tender, and the Hangzhou Mei Lianjian Construction Company won the bid. The progress of the work was very slow. Later, the Provincial Department of Construction ordered that the company was delayed, and its contracting qualification was cancelled in accordance with the contract. All losses were ordered to be compensated, and workers were hired to continue the work. It was decided to start construction on the Beigang Nanhuan Sluice Gate first. Then, Chief Lu of the Second Section of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau came to Pingyang to inspect, and the project was reorganized. County Magistrate of Pingyang, Wu Qi *, was appointed as the year-long director. Then, engineer Chen Gang was sent by the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau to preside over the project, and engineer Chen Weijia was sent as a supervisor. Construction continued on December 1st. County Magistrate Wang also served as the director, supervising the project office to actively expedite the work. It was fully completed on the 17th of last month, and the audit department came to inspect it on the 1st.

### Cultivated Land Rent Rates Should Not Exceed Eight Percent of Land Value Hereafter

[Report from our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] It is learned that the 25% rent reduction method promulgated by the Executive Yuan in the 34th year of the Republic was implemented in conjunction with the exemption of field taxes after the victory and was limited to the year of tax exemption and was of a temporary nature.

### Marine Products are Desolate, and the Commercial Market is Confused

[Aviation News from our newspaper, Hainan Island, 3rd] Haikou City, which has a population of 50,000 to 60,000, has been prosperous on the surface for the past few months, but it hides sorrow in its bones. As the twelfth lunar month is coming to an end and the Lunar New Year is approaching, the commercial market is filled with gray. Mao Zehai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, described it this way at a reception for reporters at the Datong Restaurant one day: "The thirty-sixth year of the Republic is about to pass. Looking back at the Haikou commercial market this year, it has been struggling in extreme difficulties and has not yet recovered to the pre-war situation. In terms of business operations, the number of national currency has increased several times, but it is more of a loss than a profit. In particular, grain merchants, the 98 trade, and medicinal material shops are all facing a downturn."

"Fortunately, only the native product merchants can stand firm. The largest exports of native products from this island are cowhide and rubber. However, although business can be maintained with difficulty, it is also suffering from the difficulties of the tax authorities. Taking rubber as an example, the island's rubber was originally a native product, and the government used to stipulate tax exemption to encourage exports. However, regardless of the explicit provisions of the law, the competent authorities still levy a 7% export tax on native rubber. For example, coconut oil exports are also tax-free. Now, the oil is tax-free, but the barrels for filling the oil must be taxed. Problems like this are like iron chains, restricting the development of Haikou merchants."

"Another problem is the problem between shop owners and shop tenants. Nine out of ten merchants are shop tenants, and they often have their contracts overturned by the owners at will, increasing the rent many times, or using their power to force them to close down and move. Legal judgments are like empty words, which make the Haikou merchants feel disheartened and extremely painful."

"At present, the biggest crisis in the Haikou commercial market is the pressure from foreign capital. Taking the largest store in Haikou as an example, the highest capital amount is only about 4 billion, but recently about five or six companies from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong have come to this city to engage in the native product industry, and each company has a capital amount of more than 20 to 30 billion. Large capital overwhelms small capital, the so-called big fish eat small fish, and Haikou merchants have nowhere to go."

These painful words fully depict the current outline of the Haikou commercial market.

In the past, around the time when the call for Hainan to become a province was the loudest, most merchants held a hopeful heart and took out some capital to expand, and at first glance, the market still had a shadow of prosperity, which made people feel a little comforted. However, the call for provincial status subsided, and the commercial market also underwent a major change. The most significant phenomenon is that except for a few larger foreign goods stores, restaurants, coffee shops, and trading houses that are still brightly lit, many shops light up a kerosene lamp at night, and the whole city is dark and extremely shabby. If you say they can't afford electric lights, that's not the case. The problem is that business is sluggish, and nighttime business is simply too deserted, and it's better to enjoy "saving" than to turn on another electric light.

Due to the failure of commerce to prosper, the high prices of goods, the low level of education, coupled with the serious banditry on the periphery and the impassability of transportation, the fate of Haikou's newspaper industry is quite tragic.

At present, in Hainan Island, in addition to a branch of the Heping News in Yulin, Haikou's newspaper industry is the most developed, with three daily newspapers: Daguang, Minguo, and Pinghe, and two evening newspapers: Tianxing and Shiji, becoming the eyes of the entire island's people. However, the lack of social purchasing power is quite discouraging. According to statistics close to the numbers, the total sales of the five newspapers are less than 5,000 copies, among which Daguang and Tianxing are the most popular, and Shiji has simply stopped publishing in mid-January because it could not stand firm. Speaking of advertising, which is originally the main source of income for newspapers, this road has been blocked due to the sluggish commercial market. Relying on the support of the economy is only newspaper fees, so from the 1st, the daily newspaper has increased from 3,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan per copy, and the evening newspaper has increased from 2,500 yuan to 3,000 yuan per copy from the 25th of last month. The high newspaper fees can be regarded as the highest in the country. Here, each small Yu Kou earth paper of two folio sells for 4,000 yuan. How can readers afford it?

Commissioner Han, from the moment he got off the bus, first took into account the difficulties of the newspaper industry and has requested Director Song Ziwen to agree to the China South Transportation Management Committee to allocate 100,000 tons of white newsprint under the fourth quarter quota for use by various newspapers. In this way, the only spiritual food of the people of Hainan Island may be rescued. (Our correspondent Chen Meiqing)

### Academia Sinica Institute of Mathematics Studies: Major Papers on Algebraic Topology Published Mostly in the United States

[Shenzhou News] Since its establishment in July last year, the Institute of Mathematics of Academia Sinica has been headed by Dr. Jiang Lifu. In addition to hiring research staff, it has also actively expanded its library and journal equipment to about 2,000 volumes. Professor H. Weyl, an American mathematician, has also been hired as a professor at the institute.

### After the Establishment of the International Trade Promotion Association, a Symposium on Import and Export Trade Was Held Yesterday; It Is Proposed to Request the Import and Export Control Committee to Announce the Allocation Numbers for Each Quota Period

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai International Trade Promotion Association held its first symposium after its establishment at the Duchen Hotel at 12:30 noon yesterday. More than thirty Chinese and foreign import and export merchants attended, chaired by Shen Gengyuan, the chairman of the association. After a work report, specific issues regarding import and export trade were discussed. Many people spoke, especially foreign merchants. The main opinions of the members are as follows:

They expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Import and Export Control Committee's termination of merchant registration, believing that it not only hindered the development of industry and commerce, but also conflicted with economic construction plans. The association appealed to the Import and Export Control Committee, but has not received a response to date. When Deng [name missing] Liang, Director of the Commerce Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and others came to Shanghai on the 30th of last month, this issue was also discussed. They now plan to submit a document to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which will be forwarded to the National Economic Commission for a decision. It is proposed to request the Import and Export Control Committee to announce the detailed allocation numbers for each quota period in order to reduce external dissatisfaction and criticism. It is hoped that the Import and Export Control Committee will allow the import of foreign goods as samples and advertisements. Some importers' requests for import licenses are approved while others are not. It is hoped that the responsible authorities can explain the reasons for approval or disapproval to the public so that merchants can follow the rules in their business operations. In the past, China lacked experience in managing imports and exports. Today, in the Import and Export Control Committee, there are also few people with practical experience in imports and exports; however, the organization of various trade associations in China is quite strong and sound. Therefore, it is hoped that although the management will still be the responsibility of the original authorities, the actual promotion of work will be handed over to the trade associations for self-management. China's semi-official commercial companies purchase large quantities of goods in the United States, and the convenience they enjoy is beyond the reach of ordinary private companies. For example, the Yitong Company in the United States recently negotiated the purchase of a large amount of chemical fertilizer in the United States, which is quite detrimental to the interests of various import and export merchants. Recently, the Import and Export Control Committee has been encouraging the export of China's industrial products, but according to the opinions of foreign merchants, from the perspective of obtaining foreign exchange, it is more practical to assist exporters in purchasing and exporting China's native products. This is because China's industry is currently still in its infancy.

Li Lixia, Director of the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau, was also invited to participate yesterday and delivered a speech on the spot. The gist of his speech was: Today, the difficulties of international trade lie in the worldwide shortage of US dollars, and the fact that China's rural areas suffered greatly during the War of Resistance. Now, due to internal strife, recovery is difficult. The Financial Control Bureau is involved in international trade [mainly] in cracking down on the black market for foreign exchange. The policy of the Financial Control Bureau is to crack down on illegal activities in industry and commerce and to protect legitimate industry and commerce; on the one hand, to crack down on black market foreign exchange transactions, and to make foreign exchange market prices convenient for import and export trade. The symposium ended at 2:45 PM.

### Small Chinese Stocks Prosper; Yongsha Experiences a Sharp Decline

Chinese stocks belonged to the last half-day of trading before the Lunar New Year yesterday. Credit became even tighter, leading to increased liquidation, causing some panic. Except for small stocks, which continued to prosper, with Innerwear repeatedly hitting the price limit, Yongsha bore the brunt, and the process was extremely unfavorable.

Yisha opened at 555,000, rising slightly from 550,000 to close at 560,000. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Paper and Guang were flat, Yisha and Jardine rose slightly, Yipi and Shipping fell slightly, and Steel continued to fall by half a percent.

Government bonds were initially weak yesterday but stabilized at the end of the day, with approximately 5 million [yuan] in transactions.

Domestic prices for Chongqing No. 27 black mixed bristles are 39 million yuan per load (duty unpaid) for Chongqing bristles, and 42 million yuan including packaging [costs], 50.5 million yuan for Hankou [bristles], 42 million yuan for Shanghai [bristles], and 92 million yuan for Tianjin small No. 55 black mixed bristles.

Tung Oil

Foreign tung oil prices [were influenced by] the U.S. government's investigation of China's tung oil sales to the U.S. General opinion believes that there is no evidence of dumping, and the tax proposal is expected to be terminated. However, transactions remained sluggish. New York spot prices are 25 cents per pound, and shipping is only worth 24 cents per pound C.I.F. London traders quoted 176 pounds per long ton. Domestic oil prices were stable across the board. Due to tight credit in Shanghai, buyers did not purchase, hovering around 3.2 million yuan per long ton. Chongqing 1.99 million yuan, Hankou 2.95 million yuan. Wanxian 2.24 million yuan. Wuzhou 2.65 million yuan. Guangzhou 2.869 million yuan.

### Both Coarse and Fine Yarns Rise Consistently; Cotton Cloth Market Also Turns Firm

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were characterized by extensive activity to settle accounts due to the upcoming Spring Festival holiday. However, those in the industry with ample funds took the opportunity to buy, and prices rose. As it neared the close, there was considerable hedging, and retail investors also followed suit, with market prices rising steadily. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose by 1.4 million yuan compared to the previous day, reaching 60.5 million yuan. Throughout the day, 21-count Double Horse Zhanshan was unpopular, falling by 700,000 yuan, and 10-count Jinbaoxing sales were weak, falling by 200,000 yuan. All other counts of coarse and fine yarns generally showed gains of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened steadily. The street, as the settlement period approached, showed a standstill in both retail and wholesale sales. Retail investors and out-of-town buyers made few purchases. Those in the industry with tight credit sold off spot goods, and prices were once weak. As noon approached, due to the Spring Festival holiday, the Textile Construction Company had temporarily suspended sales, market sentiment turned firm, and the street made some hedging. As a result, among the 12-pound fine cloths, Five Fortunes was actively traded and Dragon Head rebounded by 4,000 to 13,000 yuan. In addition, bleached cloth and Shilin cloth rebounded by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, while other cloths remained flat and weak.

### Manufacturers of Wool Raw Materials Stranded in Hong Kong Request Permission to Import

[Reported by this newspaper] The fourth phase of the import quota for wool raw materials has now been decided, and the allocation to each factory has been completed. Orders have been placed with foreign countries separately. As for the long-standing quota before the fourth phase of the import quota, it was allocated last month, that is, the wool arriving in port with self-provided foreign exchange was used to offset the quota, totaling 3 million US dollars, but so far, although the factories have obtained the quota, the goods have not yet arrived. The factories deeply feel that the problem is serious due to the lack of raw materials. The reason for not receiving the goods is that most of the wool raw materials in the goods with self-provided foreign exchange are still in Hong Kong, and the government's annual processing regulations stipulate that goods in Hong Kong are not allowed to be imported. It is now learned that various wool textile factories have requested the association to request the Import and Export Control Committee to allow wool in Hong Kong that has been registered with the Import and Export Control Committee to be imported, in order to maintain the current production of each factory, but the quantity shall not exceed 3 million US dollars. The association has scheduled to send representatives to visit Chairman Huo Baoshu within one or two days to present the industry's plight. According to sources, about 1.3 million US dollars worth of wool raw materials with self-provided foreign exchange have arrived in this city, while 1.7 million US dollars worth are waiting to be transported in Hong Kong, accounting for the majority.

### Cigarettes and Soap Soar

Yesterday's cigarette market saw a smooth hedging by industry participants due to relaxed credit. New buying was active, and the appetites of street door shops remained particularly strong, with prices continuing to rise. As it neared the end, ten major British Old Knife and Two Smokes continued to rise by 2.5 million to 2.2 million yuan, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan to 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

In the daily necessities soap market, retail sales were extremely brisk, and buyers were even more eager. Inventories were insufficient, and prices soared. As a result, both Guben and Arrow Knife continued to rise by 120,000 to 130,000 yuan. In addition, Guanghua, Meili, Xiangmao, and others also rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Matchboxes and kerosene also sold actively. US [product name] canned goods were traded at 850,000 to 60,000 yuan between industry participants, and barrel goods were bought for 7.2 million yuan.

### Overview of the Cotton Textile Industry in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region in 1947

— Shi Xinquan

The condition of the cotton textile industry this year, under circumstances such as restrictions on electricity supply, difficulties in the source of raw cotton, soaring cost of living index, and stagnant export trade, failed to fully develop, but was generally good.

Equipment and Operating Rate

At the end of the year, there were a total of 2,910,728 spindles in this region, accounting for 65% of the national total. Of these, private enterprises accounted for 70%, and state-owned enterprises accounted for 30%. There were a total of 37,050 looms, of which private enterprises accounted for 51% and state-owned enterprises accounted for 49% (looms in the replication industry are not included).

The average number of yarn [spinning] equipment for the whole year was 1,424,885, of which 1,182,856 were in operation, with an average operating rate of 83%. There were 18,739 looms, of which 12,172 were in operation, with an average operating rate of 65%. In the process of development, although the external factors for the cotton textile industry have deteriorated, the number of spindles has continued to advance without decreasing.

Production of Yarn and Cloth and Cotton Needed

The total production of cotton yarn by national and private factories this year was 1,394,166 pieces, of which private enterprises accounted for 72% and state-owned enterprises accounted for 29%. The production of cotton cloth was 14,737,632 bolts (the production volume of the replication industry is not included), of which private enterprises accounted for 47% and state-owned enterprises accounted for 53%.

The total cotton consumption for the whole year was 5,248,924 dan, of which private factories used 70%. State-owned factories used 30%, and the total electricity consumption was 384,084,356 K.W.H.

Production Status of Cotton Yarn

According to the estimates published by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Shanghai cotton textile industry needs 105,336 pieces of cotton yarn per month, and the replication industry needs 24,000 pieces of cotton yarn per month. The two industries need a total of 129,336 pieces of cotton yarn, and the total amount of cotton yarn needed for the whole year is 1,552,032 pieces. In addition to the actual production of 1,394,166 pieces of cotton yarn, there is still a shortage of 157,866 pieces. If the small cloth factories outside Shanghai are added, the shortage is [in the] 300,000 pieces range.

Estimated Supply and Demand of Raw Cotton

The final estimate of the national cotton production for this cotton season is 10,738,000 dan. The consumption of the manual textile industry is 2.25 million dan per year nationwide, and the manual cotton textile industry uses about 2.5 million dan. The two needs for cotton are 4.75 million dan. The cotton stored in cotton farmers is about 750,000 dan, so the cotton available for textile use this year is 5.3 million dan. Since the cotton used by factories in this region this year is 5,248,924 dan, the nation still has a shortage of 4 million dan of raw cotton this year, which must be supplied by foreign cotton. Moreover, the domestic suppression of rebellion is in full swing, and traffic congestion is even more severe. The actual cotton that can be supplied to the textile industry is likely to be less than 5.3 million dan. From this perspective, the future prosperity or decline of the textile industry depends on the cotton supply and electricity supply.

### About BCG

Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association Letter Explains [Omitted Greeting]: I have received a letter from reader Miao Juemin through your esteemed department, and I would like to briefly describe it as follows: According to BCG, it has long been used in European countries after the First World War, but due to the lack of reliable statistics, it is impossible to obtain accurate reports. Experts in the United States dared not try it, and the effect of quarantine and treatment in the United States was extremely significant, even more effective than those in Europe who used BCG. Therefore, the majority of experts in the United States still believe that BCG should not be used. According to the Monthly Bulletin of the American Anti-Tuberculosis Association: December 1947, Vol. xx, No. 12, BCG has been quite effective in Denmark. In New York City, USA, it is believed that isolating tuberculosis patients is better than vaccinating children with BCG. The most recent general view in the United States is that (1) BCG does have short-term resistance to tuberculosis; (2) BCG does not cause severe local reactions when used properly; (3) BCG should be administered by subcutaneous injection; (4) Revaccination and when to revaccinate still require further research; (5) The production of BCG should be exclusively controlled by anti-tuberculosis agencies; (6) Expanded research should continue to fully understand its effects and efficacy; (7) BCG can currently be said to be an aid to tuberculosis prevention and cannot replace current effective treatment methods. In short, China should urgently adopt BCG at this time of national and people's poverty, but do not misunderstand that BCG is as effective for tuberculosis as cholera vaccine, because BCG is still just a type of [treatment] in the trial period. Sincerely, Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Director-General Huang Jiali, January 31

### Telegraph Questions and Answers

Answered by Shanghai Telegraph Bureau [Question from Mr. Zhang, Chang Le Road]: I am a journalist. I understand there are preferential rates for the press when using the telephone. What are the rates, during what hours, and are there any restrictions? [Answer] Preferential rates for long-distance calls: 30% discount from 12:00 noon to 2:00 PM, 30% discount from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM, and a 30% discount plus a 7% deduction from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next day. However, these rates are limited to news organizations and reporters on both the calling and receiving ends.

[Question from Mr. Yang Binlong, Fangbang Road]: How are long-distance calls connected?

[Answer] There are three types of long-distance calls: calling by number, calling by name, and message delivery. Each type can be requested as either ordinary or urgent. Ordinary calls are connected in the order that users dial the number. Urgent calls are connected before ordinary calls. The number of call attempts is limited to a maximum of three during peak telephone traffic (except for military, government, and news calls). If a user wishes to connect to a long-distance call, please first dial (113 for users of this bureau, 03 for users of the telephone company). The bureau will record your information, including the desired location, type of long-distance call, telephone numbers and names, and addresses of both parties. Wait for a return call from the bureau's long-distance operator, who will advise the estimated time of connection, and the call can begin. [Question from Mr. Wang Kaiming, Linsen East Road]: Where is the nearest place to send telegrams near Songshan Road? [Answer] Starting February 4th, our bureau opened a telegraph kiosk in front of the Golden Grand Theatre in Ba Xian Qiao. It accepts and sends ordinary, urgent, and night letter telegrams, and also handles long-distance telephone calls. The kiosk is relatively close to your address, so you can go there to send telegrams.

### Sighs of Relief Amidst Disaster

— Jingwen

People who live in Shanghai's alleyways encounter door-to-door fundraising several times a year, some by monks and others by laypeople. Monks and Taoists usually have a yellow paper donation book with the words "voluntary contribution" written on it. Laypeople have more varied approaches, some bordering on coercion, others a disguised form of allocation. The more modern ones come with slogans and banners, but the donations are gathered more "civilly," making the donors a bit more willing.

Fundraising by monks and Taoists has a long history. Across cultures, religious causes generally rely on donations from devout followers. However, in our country, plagued by disasters year after year, disaster relief fundraising campaigns are constant, be it drought in one area or floods in another. Last year alone, there were floods in Guangdong and Guangxi in the south and floods in northern Jiangsu, not to mention countless other smaller-scale natural disasters.

However, natural disasters alone would be manageable because they eventually end. But in our country, all so-called "natural disasters" are actually the result of poor planning. With years of war and turmoil, who among those around thirty years old has ever lived in peace? As children, we heard stories of the horrors of the "Long Hair" era, but I believe future historians, when writing about China's modern history, might even feel some nostalgia for the Taiping Rebellion.

The combined effect of human and natural disasters has created a kind of "social disaster." This term may be my own invention, but it is very real. For example, refugee relief donations, scholarships for poor students, even disease prevention efforts, as well as various charity fund-raising campaigns through "charity sales," can all be categorized as "social disasters." However, many people simply call them social problems. Yet, if social problems require fundraising to solve them, you cannot deny that it is a kind of disaster.

Indeed, because society is a collective entity, and people have a responsibility to help each other, fundraising does not necessarily imply disaster. For example, in Western societies, in addition to charitable donations for religious causes, fundraising for academic and cultural endeavors is also very common. Many private universities in the United States, for instance, are largely supported by private donations. It is said that one American deposited a dollar in a savings account long-term, intending it to be used as a fund for a certain university a century later. This may be just an anecdote, but it demonstrates that fundraising is common even in wealthy societies like the United States.

However, while both are fundraising, their fundraising is mostly constructive and full of hope. An academic group is created through donations, a university is sustained by donations, and the brilliant academic achievements and cultivation of talent ensure that a dollar's donation yields ten dollars' worth of effect. This is truly using the power of the collective to solve social problems, or rather, to build social enterprises.

But what about us? It's better not to mention it, because it's shameful to even bring it up! How many disaster relief donations (direct or indirect) does an average Chinese citizen have to bear each year? Probably no one can calculate it. But how many victims are truly "saved"? How many social enterprises have been built through fundraising? Those who have read recent newspaper features on Shanghai's winter refugee shelters probably know the answer.

Our people are the most accommodating in the world. They never question these things. Once they have given their money, they feel they have done their duty. They can't control how others use the money. However, international perspectives on donating to China are not so simple. For example, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) recently published figures on aid given to China in the two years after the war (totaling over two billion US dollars). As a result, they cannot help but express concern about China's deteriorating situation two years later. When discussing aid to China, George Marshall also stated that China was not like European countries, and that if the US money spent in China could achieve 70% effectiveness, it would already be considered remarkable. As for where the remaining 30% goes, Marshall did not specify, but can we simply remain indifferent?

### Honored to be With You

— Hong

During one of President Roosevelt's trips, he was accompanied by a reporter from a certain newspaper, who, being newly assigned to this important task, could not help but feel proud of himself.

The President's car was traveling at high speed, and the security guards and police along the way saluted the speeding car. The reporter said to the President, "Mr. President, do you think the car is going too fast?"

Roosevelt smiled and said, "It's going just right—they know who I am."

"I understand," the reporter continued. "But please tell them to slow down a bit, so they know who's with you."

### Supplement to "Cure for Stupidity"

— Jun

The "Free Talk" section on February 4th carried an article by Tongtuo titled "Cure for Stupidity," discussing the effects of a "glutamic acid" extracted from protein on human intelligence. The term "glutamic acid" may be unfamiliar to the general reader. In fact, its sodium salt is the monosodium glutamate (MSG) that we often use.

"Glutamic acid," also known as "glutamic acid," is abundant in the proteins of wheat and soybeans. One of the methods for making MSG is to hydrolyze gluten with hydrochloric acid.

There is no fixed standard for the dosage of "glutamic acid" used to treat mental retardation. Some trial reports show dosages as high as 24 grams per day, while others show that about 10 grams per day is effective. Too much can cause insomnia, so it should only be used to treat illness under the guidance of a doctor.

The human digestive system can break down proteins into various amino acids, so eating foods or MSG containing "glutamic acid" should have the same effect as eating "glutamic acid" itself. However, the dosage needed to treat mental retardation is quite high, and the amount in ordinary diets is probably not enough.

### The Reborn Prince

— Tongtuo

The news of Mahatma Gandhi's tragic assassination has spread around the world, causing widespread grief. According to recent telegrams, his ashes have been scattered in the Ganges River, and his principles of non-violence and spiritual transformation will become historical memories. If one were to witness the cremation of the Mahatma and think of the old man who, just a few dozen days earlier, had been leading a hunger strike to urge India and Pakistan to cease hostilities, one could not help but feel a sense of loss. The thought that comes to mind is, will this generation's sage be resurrected? Of course not, his body has already turned to ashes. However, there is indeed a resurrected prince in India. The story is not long. It began forty years ago and ended in the late summer of the year before last. As we mourn the sage, let us satisfy ourselves psychologically by recounting this resurrection story as follows:

In the Kingdom of Bhowal in Bengal, India, Crown Prince Roy unfortunately passed away prematurely on May 8, 1908. The members of the royal family, including his brothers, wife, and brother-in-law, busied themselves with the funeral, preparing to cremate the body. Roy was a fun-loving person who was close to the common people, so hundreds of people followed the funeral procession through the streets of Darjeeling. Although he was a prince, he was a good "mediator."

At 8 p.m., the funeral procession arrived at the cremation ground. The body was placed on the pyre, but before it could be lit, it suddenly rained heavily. The royal family and mourners all ran to sheltered places to avoid the rain.

Two hours later, the rain stopped, and they returned to the pyre to complete the unfinished funeral rites, but the body was gone.

The relatives quickly divided into several teams to search for it. They rummaged through the ashes in the darkness of the cremation ground but could not find any trace of the body. The disappearance of the body became the talk of the town and became India's top mystery.

However, the next day, it was said that the body had been found, and the mourners went to the cremation site again. There was indeed a gaunt corpse lying on the pyre. Once the branches were lit, the ceremony was completed smoothly, without any unfortunate events.

After a period of time, Roy's widow, Pibhabati Devi, invited her own brother to manage her husband's estate, which had an annual income of nearly US$500,000. The common people did not approve of this act of seizing the country's wealth, and the widow's brother was enamored with Westernization and favored authoritarianism.

Twelve years later, an Indian Hindu monk living in a mountain cave, unkempt and wearing coarse cloth, wandered into the town of Bhowal. A street cleaner accidentally glanced at him, then looked again, and ran into the street to spread the news... the crown prince had been resurrected!

The citizens of Bhowal were amazed by this fact and gathered to see this strange figure. They asked the monk questions, but he refused to answer. People used his complexion, hair, and eyes to prove that he was the crown prince who had died many years ago. Some who had participated in the funeral said in a mocking tone: "I even saw the body turn to ashes."

"You only saw a body cremated," the believers retorted. "Do you remember that on the night of the funeral, the body disappeared?"

The town of Bhowal was divided into two factions. One faction, represented by the brother-in-law, reported to the British authorities that an imposter was claiming to be the deceased crown prince. They had cremated the deceased crown prince, which had been proven by fact. The other faction insisted that this strangely dressed monk was Hua'ai himself. However, the monk did not argue, which alarmed the widowed empress dowager, who wanted to visit this resurrected son. In order not to distrust her own eyesight, she went to an ophthalmologist to have her eyes examined first.

As soon as she saw the monk, she hugged him. "It's my son!" she said firmly. Later, she thought to examine the scars on his body—a decayed tooth, a mole, and a scar on his skin—all of which were good evidence.

Roy's sister invited the silent monk to dinner, personally went to the kitchen, and cooked the side dishes that he loved to eat when he was alive. The monk ate with relish, and the sister hugged him with tears in her eyes. "You are my brother," she said. "You remember the side dishes you like to eat—and I remember how you eat!"

The sister urged him to declare that he was Prince Roy. If the monk did not agree to do so, she threatened to starve herself to death. The monk had no choice but to ride an elephant that night, with drums and music leading the way, and announced that he was the Crown Prince of Bhowal. Thus, an open struggle ensued. The now Roy filed a lawsuit in court, asking the law to judge him as the legitimate heir to the huge estate.

The time was 1920. During the initial trial, the courtroom was packed, listening to the present Roy tell his story—

On the night of the cremation, when the cremator went to avoid the rain, he lay on the pyre and was drenched by the rain for an hour. Then, the body was discovered by Hindus living in the cave below the cremation ground. They moved it down, removed the wet swaddling clothes, and watched over it, praying before the sacred fire. Three days later, he regained consciousness—he was resurrected, but lost all memory.

He lived with the devotees, traveling throughout the country for twelve years. He accidentally became a novice among the monks, and one day he regained his memory.

"I am the Crown Prince of Bhowal," he said. The monks thought he was still suffering from mental disorder, but he was determined to go to the town of Bhowal.

The people who came to testify in court were in disagreement, and no one could agree. Roy's wife strongly opposed it and did not recognize him as her husband.

The case was litigated for a total of twenty-six years and could not be resolved. It was not until the summer of 1946 that the case was heard in the Privy Council in London, the highest judicial body in the United Kingdom. After careful deliberation by the judges, it was ruled that he was Crown Prince Roy. The monk of today regained his former identity as Prince Roy of Bhowal, and relatives and old friends congratulated him one after another. However, three days later, Roy vomited blood all over the floor and died before dawn.

Not long after, at the cremation site thirty-eight years earlier, the body of Prince Roy of Bhowal was cremated again, and this time it was confirmed beyond any doubt, and there was no heavy rain.

### Lu Jiashu Criticizes Wang Xue

— Zheng Guoyi

Although Li Gangzhu did not advocate the Zhu-Lu schools of thought, he criticized Zhu more than Lu, so he also attacked those who followed Zhu Zi without reservation. In the Qing Dynasty, Lu Jiashu was the most devoted to Zhu Zi, and his criticism of Wang Yangming was also the most severe. (He even said that "The Ming Dynasty did not fall to the bandits, but to Yangming.") Gangzhu's "Shugu Waiji" records an anecdote about Jiashu's publication of "Questions on Wang Xue," which is very interesting and is also an amusing story about Lu Qingxian's slander of Yangming. I will record it next: "Lu Jiashu served as Ling Shou, and Shao Zikun served as Qingyuan, both with a good reputation. However, Jiashu did not get along with Zikun because he followed the Lu-Wang school of thought, and they quarreled because of the publication of Zhang Wucheng's 'Questions on Wang Xue.' When he was征喀爾旦, the fuyuan ordered Jiashu to transport 　塞外, and Jiashu did not know what to do, so he sent someone to consult Zikun. Zikun replied in a letter: Such a small matter, and you're so alarmed. If 　辰濠大大變, how will you deal with it? If you just cast the 'Questions on Wang Xue' into the fire, then Yi Zhi's absurd plan will come out." Although this is a teasing book about Jiashu, it really points out the problem of scholars. Jiashu should have nothing to say. Those who easily criticize the ancients often make this mistake. The "Questions on Wang Xue" is still popular in the market today. Do readers also think of this story? However, Li Gangzhu was also very interested in his career and wanted to show himself, but in the end he could not get a chance to try. If he were really used, I wonder how he would compare to Yangming? And how much better would he be than Jiashu? I can't help but laugh at this.

### Chapter 10: Voluntary Sacrifice (66)

When Qiwan heard Yuru mention this question, her expression changed. She said: "According to Zhu Zhai, he has already divorced his wife lightly." Yuru said: "For the sake of love, Zhu Zhai may be able to do this, or even do it secretly, but in a　式 family, he cannot be allowed to do this. I questioned him, and he was stimulated. Maybe he will run away and go with you to other places, but if this happens, then my wife and I will not be able to bear this stimulus in our old age, and my family will be destroyed because of this. I have worked hard all my life, and in my old age, I still have to suffer this pain. Miss Gu—please put yourself in my place and think about how difficult it is." Yuru said here, her face was pale, her old tears were streaming down, and her hands were constantly shaking. Qiwan was originally a warm-hearted and soft-hearted person. When she heard Yuru say that it would affect his family so severely, she felt that this problem was very tricky. She sat back in her chair, biting her lip, frowning tightly, and hesitated to speak. Yuru was experienced in the world. Seeing Qiwan's expression, she knew that she could move her with sincerity, so she stood up and said to Qiwan: "I know that it may not be pleasing to the ear to say these words to young people, but I firmly believe that Miss Gu has been baptized by the old etiquette, and is definitely not the kind of fashionable young lady who only cares about the happiness in front of her and does not care about the consequences. Just say that you and Zhu Zhai are willing to get married, and I cannot stop you. If this happens, I　老 will lose a son, and after Zhu Zhai forms a family, he will lose an　老亲, this kind of spiritual pain cannot be compensated for. Miss Gu, you have lived in a big family, you should know how difficult it is for me as a head of the family to be in this situation! Your love is very pure and noble, I believe, but if this happens, you will not have a title, which is a big loss. On Zhu Zhai's side, he is violating his parents' wishes and forming a small family outside, and he will also be spared from relatives' criticism. On the side of my old couple, we have raised our son to adulthood, and the family has ended up like this. What is there to enjoy! Is this marriage perfect? Is there any regret? Miss Gu is extremely smart, and she is also a famous lady, so she must understand the advantages and disadvantages. Today, I very much hope that Miss Gu will give me a statement. If Miss Gu thinks that what I said is not important, then I am not virtuous enough to convince people, and my words are not credible. Then, my old partner and I can only let fate take its course and let you do whatever you want. I will never stop you, and I will not be responsible for anything in the future." After Yuru finished speaking, she stood tremblingly in front of Qiwan, waiting for an answer. Qiwan was very confused by Yuru's words, frowning tightly, holding her head with one hand, and silent.

According to statistics from the American philatelic community, there are as many as 11.5 million "stamp fans" in the United States alone—more than 6 million of whom are teenagers. Each time a new stamp is issued, the United States can net $15 million. In 1946 alone, Americans spent $45 million on stamp collecting. Although there are no complete statistics for 1947, it is expected to be even higher due to inflation in the United States.

Naturally, everyone is flocking to where the profits are. Many people have taken this opportunity to come up with many tricks. Even the US government is said to have been involved in shady dealings. In the early days of President Roosevelt's New Deal, a few "celebrities" with some status in Washington, DC, inadvertently talked about stamp collecting with a few senior officials in the Post Office Department. They intentionally or unintentionally mentioned that as long as a few stamps were printed slightly damaged during printing, they could immediately become rare items in the stamp market. For example, if a few stamps forgot to be perforated on the edges, they would immediately be worth ten times as much.

Sure enough, soon after, twenty kinds of "damaged" stamps printed by the US government flowed into the hands of certain "celebrities" in Washington, DC—quite a few government officials also received them. President Roosevelt also received this "gift."

These "gifts" gradually circulated. One reckless "insider" handed his share to a stamp broker and told him to sell it at the highest price. The insurance value of that stamp was as high as 20,000 yuan. The philatelic community was first surprised, and then angrily demanded an investigation into the source of these stamps. Questions were constantly raised in Congress, forcing the then Postmaster General (who was also the chairman of the Democratic Party of America) Farley to announce that all twenty kinds of "forgotten to be perforated on the edges" stamps would be sold at face value. However, the US government did not suffer a loss. After this batch of stamps began to be sold, the government netted 2 million yuan in one year, making the postal service the only department in the government that had a surplus when all other departments were running deficits. This kind of "bad stamp" has now become a category of its own in the philatelic community, called "Farley stamps." Some people speculate that this was a masterpiece created by Farley, who was known throughout the United States for his extraordinary wit, and that he relied on this one deal to overcome the financial crisis and leave.

Many small countries rely solely on issuing stamps as their only source of income, such as the Isle of Jan Mayen mentioned in a "New Peach Blossom Spring" published in Free Talk a few days ago. In addition, San Marino is the same. The amount of their stamps sold to foreign collectors is twenty times greater than the amount consumed domestically. Monaco, famous for its gambling city of Monte Carlo, Abyssinia, and Czechoslovakia all rely on selling stamps to foreigners as a major export business.

The famous Belgian physicist Professor Piccard is famous for his exploration of the stratosphere. The funds for his several explorations came from issuing a stamp. When Norwegian aviator Amundsen first attempted to fly to the North Pole in 1925, he also succeeded entirely thanks to stamps.

Unfortunately, stamps have sometimes become a backing for invaders. After the First World War, the Italian "poet politician" D'Annunzio used the profits from issuing stamps to lead troops to occupy Fiume. In 1920, Zeligowski of Poland also relied entirely on the power of stamps to forcibly occupy Vilnius in Lithuania.

### On Winter Attire

— He Ku

Upon entering winter, men's and women's attire generally undergo a slight change in appearance. Some men who wear Western suits, if they are not "die-hards," have already switched to Chinese clothing when the cold wind begins to blow. The loose robes and wide sleeves are very warm and comfortable, something Western suit wearers cannot enjoy. Since indoor fireplaces or radiators became popular in cities, a coat must also be worn outside the Chinese robe to keep out the cold. This coat has undergone some changes since before and after the war: before the war, riding breeches coats were more common, while after the war, woolen cloaks became popular. If there have been any changes in men's clothing in the past thirty years, the most prominent would be the woolen cloak replacing the riding breeches coat. As for women, they have always been more resistant to cold than men, which can be seen from the fact that they still wear a pair of silk stockings in winter, with nothing else to keep their legs warm. However, in recent years, especially after the war, the trend has changed, and many women wear short cotton jackets and Western-style trousers. It is unknown whether women in the last ten years no longer have the cold resistance of their mothers' generation, and therefore have to wear a pair of trousers that they rarely have the opportunity to wear in addition to silk stockings. I, as a seven-foot-tall man, not only have no discrimination against women, but also respect women's rights, just as I respect the rooster's right to crow in the morning, even if it startles me from my good dreams. However, I really dare not compliment women wearing short cotton jackets and Western-style trousers. This kind of attire seems to give a feeling of being neither fish nor fowl. It is a pity that I lack the interest in research; otherwise, I could examine the attire of the people in *Dream of the Red Chamber*. In fact, today's popular women's short outfits all have the qualifications to put maids under the names of the Twelve Beauties.

From the changes in men's and women's attire in winter, we can see that the two sexes are moving to extremes. The opposing forces of yin and yang can also be seen in clothing. Men have changed from riding breeches coats to cloaks, becoming simpler and more approachable, which is in line with the current difficult economic environment. Because making a living is difficult, one has to plan carefully in everything. Therefore, the cutting and tailoring of clothes are all carefully considered, and the cloak has replaced the coat. Women's clothing style, on the other hand, is inversely proportional to the prosperity of the economic environment. That is, the more difficult the economic times, the more patterns and styles of clothing there are. This expense, of course, is passed on to men after going through several circles. Therefore, it is said that an economically distressed man is further oppressed by fashion.

The Grand Historian said: "Women adorn themselves for those who please them." Now it has become "Men suffer for those who adorn themselves." The "suffering" referred to here has two meanings: one is the economic increase in consumption, and the other is the great discomfort felt psychologically when looking at this kind of incongruous winter women's clothing.
