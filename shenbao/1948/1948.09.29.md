### A US Official Said: Our Country is Launching an Eastern Alliance

[Qiazhong News Agency, Washington, 27th] A US official said on the 27th: China is launching a movement to explore how other Eastern countries react to the concept of an Eastern alliance similar to the Western European alliance and the Pan-American alliance. They said: The clue to this matter was found in the conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Indian Prime Minister Nehru on his way to Paris, and in the position taken by Wang at the United Nations General Assembly. Foreign Minister Wang pointed out at the UN General Assembly that he believed that Eastern countries were under-represented in the Economic and Social Council. They further said: Although there are obstacles to the organization of the Eastern Alliance, China will continue to work in this direction. They also said that the concept of the Eastern Alliance can be said to have inherited Sun Yat-sen's plan, as well as Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and "Asia for Asians". This plan was difficult to implement before the war, but the climax of nationalism in various parts of the East has formed a belief that the plan may be close to realization.

### Legislative Yuan Secretly Passes a Resolution Urging Prompt Demarcation of the Sino-Burmese Border; Schedules a Talk on the Current Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The 6th meeting of the 2nd session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 AM on the 28th. Because it involved two cases concerning foreign affairs and the budget, it was first conducted in secret. 371 members attended. President Sun presided over the meeting. Minister of Interior Peng Zhaoxian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Acting Minister Liu Shishun, and Director of Internal Territorial Affairs Fu Jiaojin attended. First, the report items were processed, and then the discussion items began. The first secret case was the proposal by Tao Rong and other members of the Foreign Affairs Committee to examine and approve the proposal to promptly demarcate the undetermined border between China and Myanmar in order to enhance Sino-Burmese friendship. Minister Peng and Vice Minister Liu explained the matter. Peng described in detail the history, evolution, and geographical situation of the border issue between China and Myanmar. Only one section of the southern section of the border, from Jian Gao Mountain to the Sino-Vietnamese border, remains to be surveyed and established. The area that still needs negotiation and demarcation is the area from Jian Gao Mountain to the Kangying border. The area of the disputed land is equivalent to Zhejiang Province. Britain has been working hard in this area in recent years, so the demarcation work is very urgent. Liu gave a brief report on the history of the demarcation negotiations between China and Britain and China and Myanmar, and the government's attitude towards the matter, and stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had made full preparations for this demarcation negotiation work, and would implement it as soon as there was a suitable opportunity. The two explained for an hour. Members Ma Chongliu, Xiao Cen, Guo Dequan, Lu Zongqian, Xie Jianhua and others successively raised questions, and unanimously believed that the existence of the undetermined border between China and Myanmar affected the normal development of friendly relations between the two countries. Finally, it was voted on and passed without objection to send this case to the government for execution as soon as possible. The second secret case was the report of the Budget Committee and the Finance and Finance Committee and the Economic and Resources Committee on the preliminary estimate of the operating budget of the state-owned enterprises for the second half of the 37th year. Yin Shuxian, convener of the Budget Committee, explained the examination process and pointed out the three main points of the examination report: (1) This preliminary estimate case was not compiled in detail in accordance with the operating budget compilation and examination method. The necessary data for each item was incomplete and could not be examined. Because the monetary unit of the issue of gold yuan coupons has changed, it should be returned to the Executive Yuan for re-compilation and then sent for review. (2) Matters that should be noted when re-compiling this preliminary estimate and key points for reform in the business of each institution, such as the rationalization of employee compensation and the need for profits to be turned over to the national treasury, etc. (3) Many state-owned enterprises should be reduced and reorganized. The examination meeting made specific suggestions on this, such as the need to abolish the Four Joint Offices. After Yin's explanation, Wu Ji, Zou Shuwen, Lei Yin and others spoke successively. Finally, the examination report was passed without objection, and it was replied to the Executive Yuan to act accordingly. Then, the temporary motion of Qiu Hanping and other members was discussed. The deadline for the government to redeem gold, silver and foreign currencies is September 30. According to reports from the people in Xiamen, Quanzhou and other areas of Fujian overseas remittance area, various redemption banks refused to redeem due to limited manpower, so that the overseas Chinese dependents in the above-mentioned areas will not be able to redeem before the deadline. Therefore, it is recommended that: anyone who fails to redeem gold, silver, and foreign currencies before the deadline can report the quantity and type of gold, silver, and foreign currencies in writing to the Central Bank or its designated bank before the deadline. The bank should continue to redeem them after the deadline and shall not refuse. After Committee Member Qiu explained the proposal, Secretary-General Zhang Jiyuan stood up to report that he had received a call from Secretary-General Li Weiguo of the Executive Yuan that the deadline for the exchange of foreign currency by overseas Chinese was set for the end of the year. Since the government already has other regulations, the committee asked the original proposer and agreed to change this case to an inquiry case and send it to the Executive Yuan for a reply before the 30th. The meeting adjourned at 12:00.

The regular meeting continued at 3:30 PM, still presided over by President Sun, to discuss the unfinished agenda of the fourth meeting. Xiao Zheng and others proposed to draft a bill on agricultural land reform. In addition, Pan Lianfang and others proposed to implement the case of agricultural land to farmers, urban land to urban residents, and rich resources to the state. Since it was of the same nature as the Xiao Zheng case, it was also discussed together. The committee members vigorously debated for more than two hours. After resting at 5:30 PM, Vice President Chen chaired the meeting, and the debate was still fierce. Finally, it was decided to continue the discussion at the next regular meeting. Then, after amending and passing the temporary motion of Hu Qiuyuan to schedule a talk on the current situation, the meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

### I am working hard to balance the budget; Wang Yunwu tells US economic leaders

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu said on the 27th: He has confirmed to the leaders of the US economic community that China has embarked on the road of self-help and is trying to balance the budget. All the leaders are deeply convinced of this. According to Wang, he has met with many American and international financial leaders in Washington in recent days. Wang said: These leaders are very concerned about China's currency reform and other economic measures, and most of them agree with China's bold measures this time. The government has recovered such a large amount of gold, silver, and foreign exchange just over a month after China changed its currency. They are deeply impressed and surprised. Wang also said: By the end of September, the amount of financial foreign exchange exchanged by the Chinese people to the government is expected to reach 150 million US dollars, and another 50 million US dollars may be reached. In addition to the above two items, the foreign exchange turned over to the Central Bank by various national banks is another 110 million US dollars. Minister of Finance Wang also said: His visit here is very short, so he has no plans to request loans from the World Bank or the US government. After the meeting, he plans to return to China from the west coast of the United States and is scheduled to return to Nanjing around October 10. However, he said: If there is an opportunity, he will not hesitate to contact all parties and prepare for future loans. He also said that because he has a very short time in the US, he does not intend to discuss the use of aid funds from the Economic Cooperation Administration with Director Hoffman of the Administration in the US.

### Zhang Qun Broadcasts Impressions of Japan: A Concise Report on Post-War Japan

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Former Premier Zhang Qun, at 8 PM on the 28th, broadcast "Impressions of Japan" on the Central Broadcasting Station. The original text is as follows:

Fellow countrymen, this trip to Japan to inspect has been of concern to compatriots at home and has also drawn significant attention from people abroad. My actions and statements in Japan received sympathy and encouragement on the one hand, and on the other hand, they also aroused speculation and criticism. Since returning to the country, I have been receiving visits from friends from all walks of life and have been unable to respond to them individually. Today, I have specially organized the materials obtained from the visit to Japan, and from the perspective of the future of Asia and the efforts that China should make, I would like to offer my opinions and give a comprehensive report to the people of the whole country. I hope this report can provide the people of the country with some understanding of the Japanese issue, as well as a reference for the government's decision-making on the Japanese issue.

Since the Meiji Restoration in Japan, for more than eighty years, on the one hand, the militarist ideology was formed by mixing the Shintoism and Bushido inherited from history, and on the other hand, modern scientific knowledge was absorbed as the basis for industry and military preparedness. These two tools were used by the group of Japanese warlords, plutocrats, and politicians. They used the excuse of "limited land, large population, and insufficient production" to stimulate the people internally and to justify expanding aggression externally. China and Japan are geographically close, so China bore the brunt. In the more than fifty years since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, China has always been under the iron heel of Japanese aggression. After the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolution in the seventeenth year, the power of the Chinese National Revolution and the power of Japanese imperialism changed from side conflicts to direct confrontation. From September 18th to July 7th, this conflict reached an irreversible point. Our compatriots throughout the country resolutely rose up to resist the war. During the eight years, China's loss of life and property was devastating and incalculable. However, in this war, militaristic Japan collapsed, China's century-old accumulation of international shackles was lifted, and the majority of Asian nations also gained independence and freedom. This is the result of this war, and it is also the contribution of China's eight years of hard fighting and sacrifice to Asia and the world.

After Japan surrendered, the Allied forces occupied Japan. The agency responsible for discussing policies for the control of Japan was the Far Eastern Commission in Washington. The Allied Headquarters, commanded by General MacArthur, was responsible for the actual implementation of the control policies in Japan. In the past, Japan was ruled by warlords, plutocrats, and politicians, who wantonly carried out aggression, and China suffered the most. Now, what kind of country will Japan become under the control of the Allied forces? China is naturally particularly concerned. Unfortunately, three years have passed since the end of the war. Due to the complexity of the world situation and the differences in the opinions of the Allied nations, the peace conference with Japan, like the peace conference with Germany, has not yet been able to be convened. News between China and Japan is isolated. It is difficult to obtain a clear and accurate impression from China's side about the situation in Japan. Chinese people inevitably have concerns and doubts from extreme concern, and therefore feel uneasy. Is it possible for Japanese militarism to revive by taking advantage of changes in the international situation? Can Japanese democracy be truly established? Will it revert to the old path of totalitarian politics in the future? If the Japanese economy recovers, will it enable Japan to rearm or hinder China's economic construction? Is the Allied Headquarters' policy of controlling Japan too lenient? Are there any mistakes? There are many questions, and the anti-American and pro-Japanese movement has arisen in various places, taking advantage of this suspicious concern and uneasy psychology. Before the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, I had not been to Japan for many years. The year before last, I passed through Japan on my way back to China from the United States for medical treatment. I only stayed for three days and did not have time to observe. I personally cannot provide a confident answer to the above questions, nor have I received a satisfactory answer. In order to understand the true situation in Japan after the war, and also with the encouragement of colleagues from the East Asia Association, I made this trip to Japan for inspection.

I arrived in Japan on August 21st and returned to China on September 13th. I spent three weeks inspecting in Japan, met with General MacArthur four times, and listened to reports from leaders of various political parties and important figures from all walks of life in Japan. Combining these meetings and reports with the information provided by various aspects of the Chinese delegation stationed in Japan at the Allied Headquarters and what I saw and heard in person, I would like to briefly report on the situation in post-war Japan below:

Disarmament Carried Out Thoroughly

In terms of military equipment, when the Allied forces occupied Japan, there were still 2.7 million soldiers within Japanese territory, who were disarmed within a short period of time. More than 7 million overseas Chinese and prisoners of war were also gradually returned to their hometowns within a considerable period of time and resettled. All military institutions of the army, navy, and air force were abolished, and warships, aircraft, fortresses, and other armed equipment were confiscated or destroyed. As for the military ports, airports, police, and maritime security agency, etc., which are generally concerned, from the actual situation I know: Japan's military port, Tokuyama Port, has already been abandoned after the war. The British Navy is currently using the Kure Naval Port. The Yokosuka and Sasebo naval ports are the main bases for the U.S. Navy in Japan. The Maizuru and Ominato naval ports are secondary bases for the U.S. Navy. The fortress facilities of the above ports have all been dismantled.

There were originally more than 200 airfields on the Japanese mainland. After the Allied forces occupied Japan, 33 were retained for use by the British and American air forces. A small number of them have been expanded to meet the needs, and the rest have been converted into farmland, salt fields, or other non-military uses.

Speaking of the police issue: Originally, all Japanese police belonged to the state and were uniformly commanded by the central authority. Now, there are 125,000 security police in Japan, with one handgun allocated for every five people. Only 30,000 of them belong to the central government. The autonomous police belonging to the local governments are 95,000, all of whom are voluntary professional police with no term of service. There are 30,000 clerks and secretaries, etc. Those who have served as military officers are not allowed to transfer to become police officers. In addition, there are about 9,000 railway police under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, about 5,000 economic police under the jurisdiction of the Economic Inspection Agency, and 2,000 labor supervisors under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Labor. In total, there are about 170,000 people.

As for maritime security, there are currently 29 main security boats with a speed of ten nautical miles and a tonnage of about 100 tons, without armaments. In addition, there are 15 tugboats ranging from 50 tons to 200 tons, and 60 small boats of 20 tons. There are also two 2,000-ton supply ships borrowed by the Allied Headquarters. The duties of these ships are to rescue ships in distress, prevent smuggling, and matters related to the restoration of lighthouses, salvage of sunken ships, and so on.

From the above-mentioned situations, the Allied Headquarters' work to disarm Japan in the past three years can be said to have been carried out thoroughly. The number of police, security boats, and firearms used by Japan now is considered by the Allied Headquarters to be the minimum requirement for Japan to maintain the current domestic maritime and land order and is by no means sufficient as a basis for the reconstruction of the Japanese sea and land forces. Furthermore, in terms of the fundamental conditions for national defense and military equipment, Japan has lost more than 43% of its original territory after its defeat, and has lost a lot of coal and iron resources. Materials necessary for modern warfare, such as oil and rubber, are also non-existent. Japan used decades of effort to expand its territory, seize resources, and accumulate a set of national defense forces, which were still not enough to win the Second World War, and the result was a complete defeat. Today, weapons are more advanced, and the form of warfare has changed. It is truly a very slim thing for Japan to rebuild a set of national defense forces with its existing resources and technology to cope with the next war. (Continued on page 2).

### Legislative Yuan National Defense Committee to Hold Expanded Meeting Today

### Special Article: Northeastern Idle Capital Urgently Needs to Be Resolved

— Shi Shi

It has been a month since the implementation of the new currency system. Although the government used overwhelming force to limit prices to the level of August 19th, prices in various places still inevitably show signs of underground activity. Sometimes, even if the superficial prices do not change, the quality and ingredients are being reduced. Sometimes, commodities are almost impossible to buy on the open market (i.e., at the government-limited price), forming a state of having a price but no goods. If you want to buy goods, you must go through the black market. The reason is nothing more than the sharp increase in issuance, resulting in a rapid expansion of the people's effective demand for goods. Since the currency reform, the speed of issuance has exceeded that of any previous period. This is enough to make anyone hold great hidden worries about the future of the gold yuan.

Part of the source of the issuance is indeed released by the government's redemption of gold and foreign currency, but the main source is probably the government's military and political expenditures. At a time of raging internal strife, the vastness of military expenditures is naturally expected, but whether the various expenditures are actually reported and whether they have been economized as much as possible remains to be investigated, and the military expenditures in various places, especially in the Northeast, are particularly appalling.

The area controlled by the Northeast has been reduced to only three isolated strongholds: Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou. However, we have heard that the monthly military and political expenditure in Changchun, a small place, is about to reach 700 million gold yuan. The expenditure in the entire Northeast region accounts for more than 60% of the total expenditure of the country. Why does a mere remnant of the war require such an astonishing expenditure? Why does the expenditure of the Northeast war zone exceed the total expenditure of all other war zones in the country? The large number of troops stationed in the Northeast is naturally one reason. The Northeast is said to have 800,000 troops. How can these 800,000 troops be accommodated in just three strongholds? This is already a question. And since there are 800,000 troops, why is it not only impossible to expand the surface but even impossible to open up land communication between the strongholds and with the mainland? This is an even bigger question. Leaving these two questions aside, even if we admit that there are indeed 800,000 troops in the Northeast, it cannot be a sufficient explanation for such a huge expenditure.

Another reason is the high prices in the Northeast. Prices in the Shenyang area are often ten times higher than those in the Pingjin area. Changchun is a dangerous city that has been trapped by the enemy for a long time, and prices are naturally even more unbearable. However, what was initially circulating in the Northeast was the circulation voucher. The comparison between the prices in the Northeast and the prices in the mainland had to be based on the exchange rate between the circulation voucher and the legal tender. Since the purchasing power of the circulation voucher decreased even faster than the legal tender, the government should have reduced the exchange rate of the circulation voucher to the legal tender accordingly. The same reason applies to the fact that the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender can be gradually increased due to the relatively stable value of the Taiwan dollar. It is incomprehensible why the government must insist on an exchange rate of one to ten or even one to eleven and a half. Calculated according to the purchasing power parity of the circulation voucher and the legal tender, the exchange rate between the circulation voucher and the legal tender is only one to one. The currency reform has actually followed the old method and still stipulated that the conversion rate of the circulation voucher to the legal tender is one to ten, that is, 300,000 circulation vouchers can be exchanged for one gold yuan, which is the biggest mistake of this currency reform, and also constitutes a fatal blow to the new currency system. This unreasonable exchange rate has created a disparity between the prices inside and outside the customs, and it is also the main reason why the military and political expenses in the Northeast have become so huge.

In addition, the local autonomy of the Northeast's finances is also a major reason for the excessive expenditure. Since the Northeast was taken over, the government has treated it as a special area. All military and political expenditures only need to be approved by the local commander before they can be borrowed from the Central Bank. This has created a style in which the military authorities can issue IOUs to the Central Bank at any time. When the territory shrank and prices soared, the military authorities' demand for funds exceeded the Central Bank's ability to send banknotes. However, military needs are naturally urgent and cannot be delayed for a moment. Therefore, the military authorities ordered the local Central Bank to work overtime day and night to issue promissory notes to replace banknotes. Outsiders naturally cannot know how much circulation vouchers and promissory notes are circulating in the Northeast market, but if calculated according to the exchange rate of 300,000 circulation vouchers for one gold yuan, it must account for a large part of the gold yuan issuance limit, which is beyond doubt.

In the past, when circulation vouchers could not be used in the mainland, the frenzy of inflation in the Northeast could be blocked by restricting exchange and restricting remittances. In the future, the use of gold yuan coupons uniformly inside and outside the customs, coupled with the convenience of carrying gold yuan and the inducement of price differences inside the customs, will make it impossible to stop the inward flow of Northeastern idle capital. If this problem is not resolved quickly, the torrent of Northeastern idle capital may collapse the new currency system in two or three months, and the national prices will return to their original state of rising.

To save this crisis, the government must resolutely take decisive measures. Based on the previous discussion, the principles for solving this problem are very clear:

(1) The conversion rate between the circulation voucher and the gold yuan coupon in the Northeast should be quickly changed to 3 million circulation vouchers to one gold yuan, that is, equivalent to the legal tender, so as to eliminate the price difference inside and outside the customs. Before the announcement of this new exchange rate, the circulation voucher in the Northeast and the promissory notes issued by the national banks in the Northeast should be immediately suspended from redemption in gold yuan coupons.

(2) The gold yuan coupons issued in the Northeast in the future should be stamped with the words "Limited to use in the Northeast" and only allowed to circulate in the Northeast. Remittances from the Northeast to the mainland should be strictly restricted and a high remittance fee should be added.

(3) The materials required by the military authorities in the Northeast should be purchased and transported from places where prices are lower in the mainland by a nationwide supply agency (such as the Joint Logistics Headquarters of the military) as much as possible for use, so that the budget based on the abnormal prices in the Northeast can be reduced to the minimum limit. Military and political expenses that must be paid locally should also be avoided as much as possible by issuing new banknotes and promissory notes, etc. The government should quickly transport materials that are lacking and particularly expensive in the Northeast to the local market in the Northeast for sale and allocate the proceeds from the sale to the local military and political authorities to cover their expenses.

(4) The military and political expenses in the Northeast should be slightly reviewed in the future to check whether they are actually reported and whether there are any vacancies. All expenditures should be allocated according to the budget, and the treasury system should be strictly implemented.

If the first item can be achieved, half of the problem will be solved, and the second item may not be adopted, so as not to be used by politicians and bandits to divide the hearts of the people in the Northeast. However, if the first item is not adopted, the second item will become absolutely necessary.

In short, if the current currency problem in the Northeast is not resolved quickly, all measures to maintain prices in the mainland will inevitably fail. Whether it can be resolved depends on the government's decisiveness and courage. (Peking University)

### First Batch of U.S. Aid Cotton: Allocation Work Completed. Decision Not to Cancel Food Rationing

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Executive Yuan's U.S. Aid Utilization Committee and the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch held their seventh joint symposium at 4 PM on the 28th, with Premier Weng presiding. The following matters were decided: (1) Cotton: (A) The allocation work of the first batch of U.S. aid cotton, 69,528 bales, has been completed. The allocation work was carried out by the Joint Operating Office of Cotton Yarn and Fabrics. Based on the actual needs of various regions across the country, a reasonable allocation was made after multiple careful discussions. The quantity and proportion are as follows: A. China Textile Corporation: 28,318 bales, accounting for 40.732% of the total. B. Zone 6 (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui): 29,894 bales for factories with more than 3,000 spindles, accounting for 42.994% of the total; 1,350 bales for factories with less than 3,000 spindles, accounting for 1.939% of the total. C. Zone 7 (North China, Tianjin and Beijing): 1,557 bales, accounting for 2.259% of the total. D. British Merchants: 659 bales, accounting for 0.955% of the total. E. Zone 9 (Qingdao): 552 bales, accounting for 0.789% of the total. F. Other zones: 7,198 bales, accounting for 10.351% of the total. (B) The yarn exchange ratio for the second batch of aid cotton has been discussed and finalized at the fourth meeting of the Cotton Group. It is 583.5 pounds of 7/8-inch medium-grade U.S. cotton to exchange for a 400-pound bale of 20-count yarn. Compared with 599 pounds in the first phase, it is reduced by 15.5 pounds, of which the processing fee is still 146 pounds, plus a loss of 2.5 pounds. What has been changed is the original cotton part. The original cotton figure for yarn exchange in the first phase was based on the average amount of 453 pounds of raw cotton required for a bale of yarn spun by Chinese yarn mills determined by the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Management Committee. The raw cotton figure for yarn exchange in the second phase is based on the figure of 435 pounds of raw cotton required for spinning a bale of yarn by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This figure was decided by the Cotton Group meeting, which included representatives from all parties, and then implemented after being approved by the Sino-U.S. Joint Symposium. (2) Industrial construction and supplementary equipment: Regarding the White Engineering Company's technical team hired under the special project for industrial construction and supplementary equipment, an office will be established at 1320 West Beijing Road, Shanghai in early October of this year.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Regarding the issue of food rationing, the Management Committee has previously advocated that it should be reconsidered to avoid wealthy households enjoying the preferential treatment of rationing. It is learned that the authorities, after careful consideration, have decided that food rationing will not be canceled. At the joint meeting of the U.S. Aid Committee and the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's office in China on the 28th, the issue of preparing for the food source for rationing in October was raised for discussion.

### Yan Jiagan Will Return to China from the United States

### Limiting the Japanese Textile Industry: We Will Not Modify the Plan

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Cotton Textile Industry Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai appealed to limit the number of Japanese spindles to no more than 3 million as necessary, and that the excess should be dismantled and transferred to our country as compensation in order to oppose the restoration of the Japanese textile industry. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's opinion is as follows: Regarding the production level of the Japanese textile industry, the Far Eastern Commission originally listed it as a restricted industry. However, our country has formulated restrictions on production levels for three items that are indeed related to our country, such as cotton textiles and mulberry fields, as follows: (1) 4 million cotton spindles, (2) 150,000 cotton looms, (3) 200,000 cho of mulberry fields. These figures have been separately listed in the "Revised Table of Restricted Industrial Production Levels in Japan" and were approved at the 43rd meeting of the Executive Yuan on February 17 this year as the basis for negotiation. Because the limited figures were determined by our country it does not seem appropriate to modify them.

### The Chinese Communist Party's Worldwide Propaganda Organization; Zhou Enlai is in Charge; 60,000 Japanese Troops in the Northeast Communist Bandits

[United Press Nanjing, 28th] According to Chinese intelligence, the Chinese Communist Party has established a highly efficient worldwide intelligence and propaganda organization. They are using this organization to propagate Soviet ideology and expansion among the various ethnic groups of Asia. The person in charge of this organization is Zhou Enlai, the CCP's second-in-command. In his position as the Overseas Activities Minister of the CCP Intelligence Bureau, he formulates and directs all plans.

The tasks of this organization are threefold: (1) to collect foreign intelligence; (2) to spread communism among the indigenous peoples of southern Asia and incite local rebellions; (3) to alienate overseas Chinese from the National Government.

Zhou Enlai has appointed eight representatives to guide ideological expansion work abroad. These eight people are Hu Ji stationed in New York, Zhao Mi stationed in Hong Kong, Li Lian stationed in Europe, Chen Chengnan stationed in Southeast Asia, Zhou Bing stationed in Japan, Chen Min stationed in Burma, Wu Jingliang stationed in Indochina, and Yang Qi stationed in Siam. The main branches are likely to be in New York and Hong Kong. It is claimed that the New York branch was established in May of this year through the cooperation of CCP leader Hu Ji and another Chinese leftist, Ji Fang. Ji Fang is the liaison representative in the United States for the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Party (i.e., the Third Party), and has now also been hired as an advisor to the Hong Kong branch of the CCP's Xinhua News Agency and a special correspondent for the agency in the United States. The main tasks of the New York branch are sixfold: (1) to agitate against American aid to China; (2) to support Wallace's Third Party activities; (3) to collect national production statistics; (4) to investigate the attitude of the people of the United States towards the Chinese civil war; (5) to collect intelligence on Canadian aid to China; (6) to collect all other intelligence in the political, economic, military, and diplomatic fields.

The center for guiding the CCP's overseas organizations in Southeast Asia is in Hong Kong, and Zhao Mi, the person in charge of the Hong Kong branch, maintains direct contact with Zhou Enlai.

However, the most threatening aspect of the CCP's overseas activities to the Chinese government is the Indochina branch headed by Wu Jingliang. Intelligence indicates that Wu Jingliang is organizing armed forces with his Indochinese counterparts, attempting to invade Yunnan and Guangxi.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Matsudaira, Director of the Research Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, reported on the 27th to the Security and Local Government Committee of the House of Councillors on the situation of the Japanese army in the Northeast, stating that the total number of former Japanese soldiers in the CCP army in Manchuria is approximately 60,000, mainly serving as auxiliary forces for the CCP army's operations, with a small number operating mechanized weapons or heavy weapons.

### Zhang Qun Broadcasts His Impressions of Japan (Continued from Page 1)

Shinto Politics Have Been Overthrown

Speaking of politics, Japan originally proclaimed itself a divine nation, with the Emperor endowed with divinity. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has accepted Western science and parliamentary politics, but this Shinto ideology has not changed. Therefore, Japan's constitutionalism can only be described as Japanese-style constitutionalism, and a similar model cannot be found in other countries. Since the Emperor is endowed with divinity, and Shintoism is integrated with politics, under this arrogant belief and spirit, the Japanese people were intoxicated by militarism, warlike and unafraid of death. Japanese warlords colluded with financial cliques and politicians, concentrating the economic power of the Japanese state as much as possible on national defense and armaments. The special status of Japanese military personnel in the constitution allowed the military to completely control the life of the Japanese cabinet and the direction of national policy. In addition, the strictness of the Japanese police system completely deprived the Japanese people of their freedom, allowing them to be content with the lowest wages and the most arduous work, and they dared not even think or say anything about the driving of the warlords, the exploitation of the financial cliques, and the fooling of the politicians. Japan's strength, ferocity, and tyranny over the past fifty years has been built on this psychological and material foundation. After the Allied forces occupied Japan, the spirit of the Japanese nation has been reformed. In the new Japanese constitution, the Japanese Emperor only has the power to handle ten state affairs, all of which are ceremonial and legal procedures, and all political affairs are outside his jurisdiction. The Japanese Emperor has become a symbol of the state, no longer endowed with divinity. Now, the Japanese people can freely discuss the emperor system and the abdication of Hirohito, which was never the case before the war. Although the Allied Headquarters still allows people to worship Japanese gods, it no longer allows the government to use them, and politics and religion are completely separated. Government subsidies to shrines have also been completely stopped, and the number of Shinto priests, parishioners, and believers is gradually decreasing. In terms of political line, General MacArthur's approach is to prevent the rise of extreme forces and allow a "middle-of-the-road politics" to develop smoothly. In terms of political organization, the Allied Headquarters has supported a decentralized system, reversing the past centralized model, and giving the Japanese people a high degree of freedom, allowing them to enjoy democracy and understand the spirit of democracy. These measures can be said to be very correct. The Allied Headquarters has strictly purged the personnel of Japanese aggression. From the beginning of the occupation to the present, more than 10,000 cadres of militarist groups have been purged, more than 6,200 wartime police chiefs and special police officers have been purged, more than 5,600 educational administrators and teachers have been purged, and more than 200,000 public officials have been purged. All professional military officers have been exiled. However, it is undeniable that some historical poisons still exist in Japan. These poisons are hidden in the thoughts and beliefs, social customs and habits, and arts and dramas of the Japanese people. These residual historical poisons hinder the establishment of peace and democracy in Japan, needless to say. From this, it can also be seen that establishing a democratic system is relatively easy, while developing a democratic psychology and a democratic life is still difficult. I have called this to the attention of the Allied Headquarters, warned the Japanese leaders, and repeatedly reminded the Japanese people to carry out ideological revolution and psychological construction, in order to establish a spiritual foundation for Japan's peace and democracy. But in any case, Japan's Shinto politics have been overthrown, and the Emperor has denied his divinity, so it will not be easy to restore them. The Japanese people have tasted the taste of freedom, and it will not be easy to make them give it up lightly. Japanese-style theocratic fascism is not easy to raise its head again.

Cannot Be Self-Sufficient in Three or Four Years

Secondly, let's talk about Japan's economic problems. This can be divided into two aspects to explain: First, the current economic situation in Japan: It was quite chaotic in the early days of surrender, with production stalled, a lack of necessities, soaring prices, rampant black markets, people's deposits frozen, and the quantity of rationed goods very small. The lives of ordinary Japanese people were indeed difficult. In the past three years, thanks to the control of the Allied Headquarters, American aid, and the efforts of the Japanese themselves, it has gradually improved. The Japanese Economic Stabilization Board will also increase the ration of staple foods and daily necessities for the general public from October of this year. However, Japan's economic situation is still far from self-sufficiency, let alone economic recovery. Although the Far Eastern Commission stipulates that the Japanese people can restore their living standards from 1930 to 1934, the Allied Headquarters has used all its strength for Japanese industry in recent years, and currently can only reach 55 percent of the base number of that period. There is a large gap between Japan's production and consumption. Now, American aid to Japan is filling this gap, taking out 300 to 400 million US dollars each year, about one million US dollars a day, almost all in the form of food and daily necessities. The construction work of Japan's economic recovery cannot be talked about yet. In order to reduce the burden on American taxpayers, the United States is trying its best to encourage Japan to increase production, but according to general judgment, Japan will absolutely not be able to achieve self-sufficiency for at least three or four years due to high wages, large losses of merchant ships, high freight rates, and the fact that stored raw materials have been used up and it is difficult to replenish raw materials from abroad.

Second, let's talk about Japan's economic reforms: On this point, the Allied Headquarters is steadily proceeding with the dissolution of financial cliques and land reform. Regarding the dissolution of financial cliques, the Allied Headquarters ordered the Japanese government to abolish laws restricting free competition, formulate regulations to prevent monopolies, and order the dissolution of financial clique companies that had helped Japan's external aggression in the past, and to purge privileged figures in the economic community. Regarding land reform, the current Japanese Land Adjustment Law plans to have the state purchase four-fifths of the landowners' land and distribute it to tenant farmers. In the past year, the land that has been purchased accounted for 70 percent of the total planned amount. We know that a country can only be peaceful externally if it is democratic internally, and only with economic democracy can political democracy have a solid foundation. To transform an aggressive Japan into a peaceful Japan, its politics must be democratized, and to democratize Japanese politics, its economy must be democratized. We Chinese should pay special attention to the measures taken by the Allied Headquarters in this regard, and expect them to actively proceed and achieve the goal of economic democracy and peace in Japan.

The Key to Recovery Lies in China

Speaking of this, I would like to raise a point that I would like everyone to pay special attention to. After the Japanese people suffered a disastrous defeat in the war and were in economic poverty, they all longed for economic recovery. In order to achieve economic recovery, Japan formulated a five-year plan, which was originally scheduled to be implemented from 1948 to 1952. Now, because the plan is still being revised and the progress has been delayed, it must be implemented from next year and completed in 1953. The original plan was based on an estimated population of 89 million in 1953, and the numbers for various supplies and needs were formulated. According to Japanese estimates, the implementation of this plan requires foreign aid due to Japan's foreign exchange shortage. The Japanese side calculates that the amount of foreign aid needed totals more than 1.6 billion US dollars, and also requires 200 to 300 million US dollars in working capital each year to import food, cotton, wool, coal, iron, wood, and other raw materials. According to the estimates of our country's economic experts, 40 percent of the materials imported in Japan's five-year plan come from Asia, and 50 percent come from the dollar area. According to investigations, before the war, our country, including the Northeast and Taiwan, accounted for more than 25 percent of Japan's total foreign trade. In terms of imports, Japan's planned economic recovery plan requires coal, mirrors, salt, sugar, soybeans, cotton, feed, etc. from our country. In terms of exports, Japan's raw materials are mostly taken from the dollar area, but the export of Japanese-made goods, such as cotton yarn, machinery, chemical industrial products, and woolen products, cannot hope to have much sales in the dollar area, and must rely on Asia as its main market, especially the Chinese market. Analyzing the situation mentioned above, we do not need to be blindly fearful and suspicious about whether Japanese militarism can be revived. Whether Japanese militarism can be revived mainly depends on whether its national defense power can be rebuilt. Whether Japan's national defense power can be rebuilt mainly depends on whether its economic conditions can be met. Let's take a look at Japan's economic recovery plan. The main raw materials must be taken from China, and his industrial products must be purchased by China. The key to Japan's economic recovery lies in China's hands. If China does not cooperate with Japan, Japan's economic recovery plan will not be successfully implemented. Regardless of whether Japanese Shintoism has declined, the divinity of the Japanese Emperor has disappeared, the majority of the Japanese people have realized the ineffectiveness of the warlike spirit in the war experience, the Japanese people have tasted the taste of freedom during the occupation period, the central power has been decentralized and weakened, and omnipotent politics cannot rise again, even if we move away from these psychological and institutional factors, Japan cannot re-establish a militaristic state sufficient to threaten peace in terms of economic conditions, and the key lies in our China's hands. We should abandon negative, useless suspicion, fear, criticism, and accusations. We should adopt a positive attitude towards Japan and establish a positive policy towards Japan.

### Three Powers File Lawsuit on Berlin Incident; Security Council Meets Yesterday; Soviet Union Expresses No Intention to Withdraw from the United Nations; Rumor that Molotov May Go to Paris in Person to Participate in Debate

[United Press, Paris, 28th] The United Nations Security Council will convene at 3 p.m. on the 28th (midnight Shanghai time) to hear the Western three powers' accusation against the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The United Kingdom, the United States, and France have jointly drafted a document requesting the Security Council to review the Berlin issue. The document will be submitted to UN Secretary-General Lie today afternoon. The document is based on Article 7 of the UN Charter, "Handling of Emergency Issues."

[Agence France-Presse, 27th] The Security Council is expected to meet on Thursday or Friday to discuss the Berlin incident. Observers expect a fierce debate over the principles of the discussion. The Soviet Union will rely on Article 107 of the Charter, arguing that the United Nations has no right to interfere in issues concerning Germany. The Western powers believe that the issue submitted to the Security Council is not the entire German issue, but a specific issue of the Berlin blockade. Some observers expect the Soviet Union to engage in a kind of boycott of the Security Council, as it did two years ago when discussing the Iranian issue. At the same time, diplomatic sources point out that it can now be predicted that the Soviet Union will still use its veto power in the Security Council's discussion of the Berlin incident. If so, the next legal step is to submit the issue to the General Assembly, which does not require the unanimous consent of the five major powers.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] It is rumored that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will arrive in Paris in a few days to attend the Security Council meeting and participate in the debate on the Berlin incident, but this news has not been officially confirmed. It is widely believed that US Secretary of State Marshall, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman will represent their countries in person. It is also rumored that when the Security Council begins to study the Berlin incident, the United Kingdom may transfer the chairmanship of the council (currently held by Jebb) to a country not directly related to the issue. According to the rotation, the US representative will take over the chairmanship in October.

[United Press, Paris, 28th] Representatives from the Soviet Union and Belarus have stated that the Soviet Union will not withdraw from the United Nations, but intends to stay and fight the West to the end. At today's General Assembly meeting, Bevin and Vyshinsky were both absent. Soviet representative Malik temporarily replaced Vyshinsky.

### Soviet Union Increases the Berlin Crisis; French Foreign Minister Condemns Harshly; Emphasizes that Europe Should Unite Closely to Seek Survival; General Debate of the General Assembly Concludes Last Night

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] It is expected that the General Assembly plenary meeting will conclude its business tonight, and all subsequent meetings will focus on the work of the committees. The Security Council is scheduled to meet this afternoon to record the Hyderabad withdrawal of the lawsuit against India, review Bulgaria's application for membership, and review Switzerland's application for membership in the International Court of Justice.

[United Press, Paris, 28th] French Foreign Minister Schuman and retired Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King continued Bevin's attacks on the Soviet Union in the General Assembly today.

King spoke first, condemning the Soviet Union for deliberately obstructing the "political and economic construction of the post-war world" and undermining the United Nations. He also praised countries that seek security "without being bogged down in the world." Finally, he suggested that the United States' atomic energy control plan, since only the Soviet Union opposes it, could be implemented and developed by the world without Soviet participation.

Schuman followed, accusing the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin as an "act of force." He denounced the Soviet Union for lacking the "minimum of goodwill" to solve issues such as the four-power co-management of Berlin and Germany. Schuman echoed King, saying that the United Nations has failed and is now standing at a crossroads. He pointed out that the factors of failure lie in the world being divided into two ideological groups and the Soviet Union "overusing its veto power." Schuman responded to the US Secretary of State's assurance that he was determined "not to allow us to lose our rights and abandon the people we are responsible for protecting." Schuman said: "We are now living in an era of broad economic units and political agreements, so Europe should unite to survive." Schuman also proposed France's heartfelt plan - a European Federation. He said: Europe should "unite to survive" and called on governments to act quickly. Therefore, the focus is once again placed on the development of regional organizations to assist the United Nations, which has been undermined by the Soviet Union and is on the verge of failure.

### Belgian Foreign Minister Speaks; Warns the Soviet Union

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 28th Radio Broadcast: Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak spoke at the General Assembly on the 28th, warning the Soviet Union that the Western countries will never succumb to communism, just as they resisted Hitler's totalitarianism.

### General Assembly Decides to Include South Africa's Racial Discrimination Case on the Agenda

[United Press, Paris, 28th] The United Nations General Assembly decided on the 28th, despite the strong protests of South African representative Louw, to debate again the racial discrimination case in South Africa proposed by India. Louw first argued and protested, claiming that the case was entirely within the jurisdiction of South Africa, and that if the United Nations intervened because India had demands on South Africa, it would exceed the jurisdiction stipulated in the Charter, and the United Nations had no power to make a judgment on such matters of member states. General Assembly President Evatt of Australia mildly rebuked Louw, saying that the issue of the limits of the General Assembly's jurisdiction belonged to the Assembly's subsidiary committee, and that the committee would vote on it. Evatt finally ruled that the General Assembly's jurisdiction should be transferred to the General Committee, and India's racial discrimination complaint should remain on the agenda for debate.

### Soviet Union Proposes New Flight Control Regulations, Attempting to Disrupt the Berlin Airlift; Western Authorities Reject Outright

[United Press Berlin, 27th] US senior officials stated on the 27th: The Soviet Union has recently proposed a set of "regulations" to the Berlin Four-Power Air Safety Control Authority, which would disrupt the Western countries' airlift to Berlin. The rules proposed by the Soviet Union would prohibit instrument flying and would give the Soviet Union the right to drive away any aircraft attempting to land at Tempelhof Airport in the American sector of Berlin. The Soviet authorities intend to force Western countries to accept these regulations, insisting that these new regulations will now control flights. However, the American, British, and French military governments have rejected them outright.

An American official stated, "These regulations can be summed up in one sentence: to make the airlift impossible." The Soviet regulations are: (1) "Prohibition of night flights along the air corridors," which would eliminate 50 to 60 percent of current airlift operations. (2) "Prohibition of flights in dense cloud cover," which would eliminate 30 to 50 percent of daytime airlift operations. (3) "Flights over the occupation zones of Greater Berlin must be approved by the respective occupying power." (4) "Flights are prohibited along the air corridors or near landing and takeoff airports when there is wind, rain, fog, icing, or other similar conditions."

### US to Send More Aircraft to Strengthen Airlift Operations

[Agence France-Presse Wiesbaden, 27th] US Air Force General Curtis LeMay, currently stationed in Europe, told reporters that the United States will soon send an additional 100 C-54 aircraft to participate in the Berlin airlift. Each of these aircraft can carry ten tons. During the winter months, Berlin needs at least 4,000 tons of supplies per day, but 4,700 tons is considered a safer margin. When asked what the US attitude would be if the Soviet Union continued its obstruction tactics, LeMay replied that the US Air Force would continue its requisitioning plan. LeMay has now been appointed as the head of the US Strategic Air Command. His position in Berlin will soon be replaced by General Kunkel.

### Soviet Disarmament Proposal Added to UN General Assembly Agenda

The conclusion of the note states that the Security Council has an unshirkable duty to study the situation in Hyderabad and bring an end to this fait accompli.

### Romanian Ambassador Dies and is Resurrected

### International Monetary Fund Issues Report, Expresses Pessimism About World Economy, Urges Countries to Balance Budgets and Prevent Inflation

[United Press Washington, 28th] In its third annual report released on the 28th, the International Monetary Fund stated that if we hope for economic recovery to be completed before the end of US aid in 1952, countries receiving aid from the Economic Cooperation Administration must expand exports to the Western Hemisphere. The report expressed general pessimism about the world's economic and financial situation.

The report stated that the IMF still does not see an easy solution to the balance of payments problem between European countries and the United States. It also pointed out that in the past year, despite grant and loan assistance, the trend of depletion of reserves and deterioration of national financial conditions has worsened in almost all countries.

The report also called on countries threatened by inflation in Europe, the Western Hemisphere, and the Far East to reduce consumption and increase taxes in order to achieve a cash budget surplus.

### India May Declare Itself a Republic Before the End of This Year, Will Still Maintain Some Relationship with Britain

[United Press New Delhi, 27th] Reliable sources stated on the 27th that India may secede from Britain and declare itself a republic before the end of this year. It is reported that Prime Minister Nehru has been authorized to suggest at the British Commonwealth conference in London that India be formally declared a republic, while maintaining some relationship with Britain. This agreement must be approved by the Constituent Assembly, which will be convened after Nehru returns to India from the London conference. Most members of the ruling Congress Party advocate maintaining a genuine connection with Britain, while the Socialist Party and the Communist Party advocate complete separation from Britain. Therefore, the Cabinet and the Congress Party authorized Nehru to study a compromise. It is rumored that the Congress Party believes that complete separation would provide the British Conservative Party with campaign material, which would be tantamount to undermining the Labor Party, which granted India dominion status. It is rumored that Nehru will propose that India, as a republic "associated" with the United Kingdom, remain a member of the Sterling Area and will ask Britain to assist in training its British-equipped army. The final decision on the plan rests with the Constituent Assembly, which will soon vote on the draft constitution drafted last year.

### Zhang Qun Broadcasts Impressions of Japan, Continued from Page Two

The Asian Century Has Already Begun

We must recognize that the construction of the world from now on will be centered on Asia. We can say that with the end of World War II, the Asian century has begun. The world's richest and undeveloped resources are in Asia. Asia has one billion people, and the lowest living standards are also in Asia. The main problem for Asia in the future is how to develop its own resources, manufacture its own goods, and improve the living standards of the Asian people. This work must be carried out by all Asian countries and nations, uniting and cooperating according to the spirit of the United Nations Charter regarding economic cooperation and in coordination with the work of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, forming a mutually complementary, mutually beneficial Asian regional economic group. In this Asian economic group, China has an unshirkable responsibility to take the initiative. If we do not underestimate ourselves, this regional economic plan should be formulated by China in consultation with the relevant countries, and this joint construction work should be led by China. And a peaceful and democratic Japan certainly cannot be excluded from this circle. Only by thinking about the future of the entire Asia can a peaceful and democratic Japan be given its due status. Before Japan's defeat, Japanese militarists once put forward the slogan of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." That co-prosperity sphere was an economic zone with Japan as the master and other Asian nations as slaves. It was an economic zone with extreme aggression and exclusiveness. Precisely because of the existence of Japanese militarism, Asia's economy could not develop in a balanced way. Now that Japanese militarism has been destroyed, the possibility of establishing a truly mutually beneficial and mutually supportive Asian regional economic group has only just begun. Therefore, we should, on the one hand, prevent the revival of Japanese militarism so that it no longer poses a threat to peace, and on the other hand, guide the progress of Japanese economic democratization so that Japan's strengths, that is, the scientific knowledge that Japan has accumulated in the past fifty years and the industrious and hardworking nature of the Japanese people, can make a full contribution to Asian economic construction. Therefore, we should, under the grand principle of preventing Japan from rearming and coordinating with the overall economic construction of Asia, conditionally support Japan's recovery.

Overall Interests, Far-Reaching Measures

Recalling that at the beginning of the end of the war against Japan, our President was the first to declare that China would not adopt a policy of national retribution against Japan. The Japanese people were deeply moved by this statement. The so-called "no retribution," in a negative sense, expresses the magnanimity of our nation. In a positive sense, it must be expressed in the country's policies. That is to say, when we deal with the Japanese issue, we must not only passively refrain from retribution, but also actively do something. We must adopt far-reaching measures based on the overall interests of the various Asian countries and nations and the permanent relationship between China and Japan. We should promote the convening of a peace conference with Japan. We should, under an overall Asian plan, determine the economic relations between China and Japan and between China and other countries. Asia's economy must be developed and prospered, but economic development must be balanced, prosperity must be comprehensive, and the survival and security of Asian nations must be guaranteed, but national survival must be autonomous, and security must be collective. The two issues of economic development and prosperity and national survival and security are inseparable. We must first and foremost secure the freedom of Asian nations from common want, and then we can truly secure the freedom of Asian nations from common fear. The Japanese issue is ultimately an Asian issue. By considering and handling the Japanese issue within the context of the entire Asian issue, all historical grievances and post-war doubts will naturally be correctly resolved.

These are my personal views on the current Japanese issue. I would like to present them here for correction to my compatriots throughout the country. I respectfully ask those who are concerned about the Japanese issue to provide guidance and discuss them together. I am deeply gratified.

### First Batch of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate to be Sold Today; Notices to be Distributed to Residents in Three Days; Shao Daoshi's Military Residence Most Expensive, Estimated Value Exceeds 600,000 Gold Yuan; Current Residents are Mostly Government Agencies and Leaders from All Walks of Life

[This Newspaper] The first batch of 80 units of enemy and puppet real estate in this city has been officially announced for sale by the China Trust Bureau today. This batch of real estate consists mostly of garden villas or detached houses, which are the finest enemy and puppet real estate in this city. The total value accounts for 20% of the total value of enemy and puppet real estate in this city. According to the China Trust Bureau's announcement, the current residents of each unit of real estate should, within ten days of receiving the notice from the Bureau's Real Estate Department, exercise their right of first refusal to purchase the property at the price listed in the notice, and pay half of the price as a deposit. The remaining balance must be paid in full within one month from the date of the notice. Failure to pay within the deadline will result in forfeiture of the deposit. If the current residents do not purchase the property within ten days, it will be considered a waiver and will be publicly auctioned without further notice. However, current residents may still participate in the bidding. If the current residents do not win the bid, they must vacate the property within one month from the date of expiration of the notice for the right of first refusal. Failure to do so will be enforced by the competent authority.

If there are more than one current residents in each unit of the above-mentioned real estate, if each resident intends to purchase the property, they may first negotiate among themselves to elect or recommend one resident to purchase the property. If the dispute cannot be resolved, each resident may go to the China Trust Bureau Real Estate Department to draw lots to determine one resident to purchase the property within ten days after receiving the notice. The China Trust Bureau is not responsible for clearing out the other residents in the same unit of real estate purchased by the original resident. The Bureau is responsible for requiring all original residents to vacate the properties purchased at auction within the prescribed period. According to the reporter's investigation, the current occupants of this batch of real estate are mostly acting in their individual names, but some are acting in the name of government agencies. The latter will be more difficult to handle. The China Trust Bureau is currently busy assessing the value of the properties, which is based on the prevailing market price in accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan. Notices will be distributed to the residents in three days.

The Lowest Price is Tens of Thousands of Gold Yuan per House

It is understood that the two houses at 80 Yuqing Road and 262 Hunan Road have the highest estimated value, both exceeding 600,000 Gold Yuan. The house at 80 Yuqing Road was originally the residence of Shao Daoshi's army and is currently occupied by the Municipal Party Committee. The lowest estimated value is also tens of thousands of Gold Yuan per house. Among the current residents are prominent figures of the Nationalist Government, such as Vice President Li, Bai Chongxi, Chen Yi, Wu Tiecheng, and Zou Lu. Among them, Vice President Li's residence was originally occupied by Feng Yuxiang and was only recently allocated for Li's residence in Shanghai. It is currently being cleaned and renovated. However, Li has never visited the residence during his recent trip to Shanghai. According to Huang Xuecun, secretary of the Presidential Palace who accompanied Li to Shanghai, Li has never discussed the matter of allocating the residence for his use, so there is no preparation for purchasing it. In addition, some of the current residents of this batch of real estate are acting in the names of their family members, such as Ren Xianqun, the former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal People's Survey Committee and the current chairman of the Zhejiang Commodity Distribution Committee, whose residence at 115 East Sports Association Road is registered in the name of his wife, Zhang Yunqian. Other well-known figures include Zhao Zhiyao, He Yaozu, Fang Dong, Tang Zong, Cha Liangjian, Chen Zhiping, Li Gufan, Deng Baoguang, Gong Tianwu, Zhu Qingzeng, and Han Deqin.

### Luxury Goods Ban Not Yet in Effect; Jewelry and Diamond Industry Appeals to City Council

[This Newspaper] The Central Government, in accordance with Article 12, Paragraph 2 of the August 19th Financial and Economic Emergency Ordinance and the Regulations for Strengthening Economic Control, has formulated measures to ban the sale of imported luxury goods. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for implementing the ban in this city, which is scheduled to take effect on October 1st. Violators will have their goods confiscated. It is reported that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has not yet received the implementation order. The jewelry and diamond industry in this city recently submitted a petition to the Municipal Council regarding the ban on the sale of imported luxury goods, stating the importance of the industry. It is claimed that 400,000 people nationwide rely on the industry for their livelihood. They believe that banning foreign imports is acceptable, but banning domestic sales is inappropriate. The Municipal Council intends to forward this request to the Executive Yuan for review.

### Automobile and Gasoline Conservation Meeting: Regulations Stipulating Implementation Methods for Reduction, Following the Principle of Four-Out-of-One or Two-Out-of-One, Reducing 600 Vehicles, Licenses Temporarily Not Revoked

[Report from Our Newspaper] The municipal government convened an automobile and gasoline conservation meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, chaired by Mayor Wu. After discussion, it was resolved to submit three plans for reducing automobile gasoline consumption, based on the "Private Use Automobile Restriction Regulations" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, to the Executive Yuan for approval. Starting next month, the city will temporarily implement the third plan. The details are as follows:

Plan One: (A) Official vehicles of government agencies, and private legal entities that meet the identity requirements stipulated in the Executive Yuan's automobile restriction regulations (i.e., banks, factories, mines, and large-scale private enterprises related to people's daily necessities): shall be reduced according to the principle of "four-out-of-one" (combining large and small vehicles). (B) Doctors shall be reduced according to the principle of "two-out-of-one." (C) Automobiles of private individuals or private legal entities that do not meet the identity requirements stipulated by the Executive Yuan shall be completely reduced.

Plan Two: (A) Official vehicles of government agencies and vehicles of qualified private legal entities shall be handled in accordance with item (A) of Plan One. (B) Vehicles of private legal entities that do not meet the identity requirements (such as shops, small factories, various church organizations, etc.) and vehicles owned by qualified private individuals shall be reduced according to the principle of "two-out-of-one" (combining large and small vehicles). (C) For automobiles of private individuals who do not meet the identity requirements, each household may retain one vehicle, and all others shall be completely reduced.

Plan Three: (A) Official vehicles of government agencies (regardless of central or local government agencies) and vehicles of qualified private legal entities (i.e., banks, factories, mines, and large-scale private enterprises related to people's daily necessities, details in the attached document) that meet the identity requirements stipulated in the Executive Yuan's "Private Use Automobile Restriction Regulations" shall be reduced according to the principle of "four-out-of-one" based on their original registered household (combining large and small vehicles). (B) In addition to official vehicles of government agencies, this plan refers to the principle of reducing vehicles by "four-out-of-one" or "two-out-of-one" to conserve gasoline. The gasoline allocation is divided into the following two types: (1) Vehicles that should be retained, accounting for three-quarters or one-half, will be allocated gasoline according to the future stipulated amount. (2) Vehicles that should be reduced, accounting for one-quarter or one-half, will be temporarily allocated gasoline. Large vehicles (i.e., trucks) will be temporarily given a basic gasoline amount of 20 gallons per month, and small vehicles will be temporarily given a basic gasoline amount of 10 gallons per month. The licenses will not be revoked temporarily. The number of vehicles exceeding four or two, but not fully reaching four or two, will also be handled in this manner. (C) The methods for conserving gasoline in this plan are as follows: (1) Private legal entities that meet the identity requirements will be handled according to the principle of "four-out-of-one."

### Prosecuting Bao Guochang and Six Others for Raising Prices of Shinyi Western Medicines

### Chinese and Western Restaurant Industries Declare War on Vegetable Vendors: Refuse to Buy Black Market Vegetables, Willing to Accept Business Losses

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's Restaurant and Vegetable Association will jointly launch a "No Buying Black Market Vegetables Movement" with the Western Restaurant Industry Association starting on October 1st. According to the two associations, this move is entirely to inspire the conscience of those engaged in the vegetable business, to make them realize the difficult times, abide by government laws and regulations, and consider the welfare of the public, and not to greedily seek excessive profits. The two industries stated that since the authorities announced the price limits on vegetables, they have been most affected. Each restaurant sells mostly chicken, duck, fish, and meat, but the large amount of chicken, duck, fish, and meat is almost entirely obtained from the black market because the supply in each vegetable market is limited. However, on the other hand, the dishes they sell cannot but be based on the price limit, so the losses in the past month have been huge. In order to seek compensation, they resolutely launched this movement. Starting next month, the sales in the restaurant will still be normal, but will be limited to vegetables that can be purchased within the price limit. Therefore, large-scale banquets will not only temporarily disappear, but even ordinary diners will feel that the dishes are not abundant. According to the two industries, this movement will continue until the vegetable industry can understand and cooperate. During this period, they are willing to accept business losses.

[Another Report] Vegetable vendors are difficult to manage. Before going to Beijing, Chiang Ching-kuo had instructions to establish a special team to be responsible for solving the problem, but in fact it has not been established yet, and everything still needs to be dealt with after Chiang Ching-kuo returns to Shanghai.

### Single-Load Carriers Carrying Cloth: Confiscated and Punished According to Law

North Station Decides on Handling Principles

Since the authorities implemented price controls, two-way single-load carriers have become particularly active. Because of this, the Economic Supervisor's Office prohibited the outward transport of rice, cloth, etc. from Shanghai starting on the 26th, and strengthened inspection work. The North Station took the following three measures for passengers who privately carry cloth: (1) Those who were indeed unaware of this prohibition and did not conceal the cloth they were carrying were ordered to return their tickets and return the cloth to its original location, and no penalty was imposed on them. (2) If a legitimate passenger knew that they could not carry cloth but attempted to pass through by chance, the inspectors would also advise them to return their tickets. If they refused to return their tickets and intended to bribe or use other improper methods, they would be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. (3) Single-load carriers who are engaged in the business of transporting cloth know that they cannot export it, but hide the cloth on their bodies or in suitcases and clothing. If they are caught after inspection, in addition to not being allowed to return their tickets, they will be punished according to law.

### Traffic on Jing'an Temple Road is Blocked: Tram Derails and Runs onto Sidewalk

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 8:10 PM yesterday, a tram number 610 from the American Company Second Road had just departed from Jing'an Temple Station and was slowly traveling east. When it passed the door of the Santai Hardware Store at 642 Jing'an Temple Road (where it is a single track), several sedans were also traveling east. Suddenly, a No. 10 public bus (registration number 03-0499) sped up and attempted to pass between the sedans and the tram. With a slight carelessness, it hit the left side of the first section of the tram. With a loud noise, the tram was pushed off the track, and all four wheels came off (see photo taken by our newspaper Okamoto). Fortunately, it did not overturn, so there were no deaths or injuries. However, because all four wheels of the tram were derailed at the same time and the brakes lost control, the front of the car moved sideways to the left and stopped when it hit a large tree on the sidewalk. For a time, traffic was blocked, and pedestrians gathered to watch, all feeling that it was a rare event to see a tram running onto the sidewalk. The tram driver No. 128 also said: "I have never encountered this situation in more than ten years of driving trams." Afterwards, the tram company immediately sent a machine to put the tram that was blocking the road back on track, and everything returned to normal at 9:05 PM.

### Violation of the Exchange Law Case: District Court Pronounces Sentence Yesterday, Lin Legeng and Others Sentenced to Seven to Ten Months

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of stockbroker Lin Le(geng) and Du Weiping, Tao Liguolan, Xu Yangshuyao, etc., selling stocks in violation of the Exchange Law was pronounced by the District Court yesterday. The main text is: "Tao Liguolan engaged in empty trading outside the exchange based on the market price of the exchange, exclusively calculating profits and losses, sentenced to ten months of imprisonment.

Du Weiping jointly and continuously bought and sold outside the exchange to the entrustor using the same calculation method, sentenced to eight months of imprisonment.

Lin Legeng jointly bought and sold outside the exchange to the entrustor using the same calculation method, sentenced to eight months of imprisonment.

Xu Yangshuyao engaged in empty trading outside the exchange based on the market price of the exchange, exclusively calculating profits and losses, sentenced to seven months of imprisonment."

Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, the defendants were brought from the First Detention Center on Massenet Road. More than a hundred family members, with heavy hearts, came to court to listen. At 10:00 AM, Presiding Judge Shen Tianbao and Judges Mei Erhe and Fang Xianghai, and Prosecutor Ding Tongjun, took their seats and announced the sentence in the Eighth Criminal Court. They first announced the reasons to the defendants, and then recited the main text of the judgment, and stated that the judgment would be delivered within two days. If they did not agree with the judgment, they could file an appeal within ten days. The defendants listened to the sentence and showed no expression. Tao Liguolan then showed a bitter smile, while Xu Yangshuyao immediately burst into tears, weeping uncontrollably, and was immediately taken out of court and returned to custody. The reasons for the judgment listed in the judgment are recorded as follows:

"The law stipulates that brokers may not use the same or similar calculation methods for entrustors for the buying and selling entrusted to them if they are not buying, selling, or delivering within the exchange to which they belong. Brokers who violate this regulation shall be punished according to Article 53. Furthermore, those who engage in empty trading outside the exchange based on the market price of the exchange, exclusively calculating profits and losses, shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year or a fine of not more than 3,000 yuan, as stipulated in Articles 38 and 53 of the Exchange Law. In this case, the defendants,

Regarding the facts, Du Weiping admitted in the police station that he sold 16 million shares of Yongs yarn to Lin Legeng on August 16 and 12 million shares of Yongs yarn to Dong A'er and others on August 19, all of which were off-exchange transactions without accounting for checking. Lin Legeng admitted that he purchased 16 million shares of Yongs yarn from Du Weiping, which was an off-exchange transaction. Tao Liguolan and Xu Yangshuyao admitted that they each sold 2 million shares of Yongs yarn on August 19. During the trial in this court, in addition to the testimonies of Tao Liguolan and Xu Yangshuyao being the same as in the police station, Du Jiping stated that the affairs of Hongxing Securities Company were the responsibility of Qiu Yunfeng, who is on the run, and the affairs of Huamei Industrial and Trading Company were the responsibility of Sun Shuren. After August 11, he was ill and could not go to take care of the affairs of the company. All off-exchange transactions were done by Qiu Yunfeng, and he himself had no responsibility. Huamei Industrial and Trading Company only called Hongyu Securities Company on behalf of Tao Liguolan and others to notify the purchase and sale of stocks, and did not do stocks on their behalf. Lin Legeng changed his statement, saying that the 16 million shares of Yongs yarn were purchased privately from Hongxing Securities Company, but the previous agreement was canceled due to price discrepancies, and the transaction was not completed. This court investigated that Du Weiping had Hongxing Securities Company and Huamei Industrial and Trading Company set up in the Securities Building and Puyi Building, both of which were engaged in securities. Huamei Industrial and Trading Company,

Equipped with a blackboard (with newspapers sealed on August 21 of this year), amplifiers, intercom telephones, and stock delivery words recorded on the wall, as stated by police officer Wang Sizu. Tao Liguolan and others not only opened accounts, bought and sold stocks, and collected legal tender on the same day, but also saw seven or eight people buying and selling stocks at the same time. If they were not engaged in the stock business on a regular basis, how could so many customers come to Hongxing Company to sell stocks, with the amount of Yongs yarn alone reaching a huge 28 million shares. The scale was not small. If it was not with the permission of the company owner, how could the store friends have so much financial resources to engage in a large number of off-exchange transactions. At the same time, how could the shop owner have never noticed it on a regular basis? Based on reason and emotion, it is even more unbelievable. When he was interrogated jointly with Qiu Yunfeng in the police station, the defendant also admitted that he had instructed Qiu Yunfeng to sell short in advance, and the amount could not be large. 12 million shares were off-exchange transactions without accounting (in the police records of Du and Qiu, those that do not indicate Lin's answer to Qiu's answer are answered by one person with the consent of others, which was explained by police officer Qi Chengshu). Lin Legeng also stated that 16 million shares were not obtained with a transaction order. The 28 million shares of Yongs yarn were purely off-exchange transactions. Hongxing Dengquan Company and Huamei Industrial and Trading Company were both operated under the instructions of the defendant,

Undeniable facts are reversed afterwards in the hope of avoiding responsibility, which is not credible. As for Lin Legeng's purchase of 16 million shares of Yongs yarn, he admitted in the police station that both parties conducted delivery and cleared each other. According to Lin Legeng, who is an important staff member of broker No. 190, the purchase and sale between them is the purchase and sale between brokers. Since it did not go through the exchange, it was an off-exchange transaction. It is not credible that he described it as his own purchase and sale during the trial, and that the transaction was canceled without being completed. Those without broker status who jointly implement the crime with those with broker status should still be regarded as accomplices. They each constitute the crime of buying and selling outside the exchange to which they belong and using the same calculation method for the entrustor in the Exchange Law. Du Weiping, based on a general intention to commit a crime, repeatedly committed the same act, which should be regarded as a continuous offense and treated as one crime. As for Tao Liguolan and Xu Yangshuyao selling Yongs yarn stocks at 9:00 AM on August 19, 2 million shares each, and then buying 2 million shares each at 11:00 AM, in addition to offsetting, each earned 2.4 billion Legal Tender.

Indisputably admitted to their error. It was found that the defendants did not have the stocks beforehand, but sold them short outside the exchange and then purchased them later, purely using the rise and fall of the market price as a kind of gambling-style empty trading, which constitutes the crime of empty trading outside the exchange based on the market price of the exchange, exclusively calculating profits and losses, and is also beyond doubt.

The original purpose of the state's establishment of a stock exchange was to control the stock market, balance stock prices, so as not to rise and fall rapidly, disrupt finance, enable those with floating capital to have a legitimate outlet, and make those who seek exorbitant profits have no way to use their skills. Industry and commerce would be revived, and the market would be stabilized.

With good intentions. However, the defendants, Du Weiping and Lin Legeng, still conducted securities transactions outside the exchange. Tao Liguolan and Xu Yangshuyao implemented empty trading, which is contrary to the purpose of the state's establishment of a stock exchange and promotion of securities trading. They only cared about profits and ignored national policies. If they were not punished by law, it would not be enough to deter them. Therefore, considering the circumstances, within the scope of the statutory principal punishment, Tao Liguolan was sentenced to ten months of imprisonment, Du Weiping and Lin Legeng were sentenced to eight months of imprisonment, and Xu Yangshuyao was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment, to show punishment and achieve the effect of clearing up speculation.

In conclusion, in accordance with the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 38, paragraph 1, paragraph 3, Article 53 of the Exchange Law, Article 11, Article 31, paragraph 1, Article 28, and the preceding paragraph of Article 56 of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.

### Economic Reform's First Month in Guiyang

— Our Correspondent, Liu Mengchi

[Our Correspondent, Guiyang, 24th by Airmail] Guiyang is a city with a population of only 300,000, but it is, after all, one of the provincial capitals in the Southwest. During the eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of suppression of the rebellion, it has gradually become prosperous in this relatively stable rear area, and has gradually grown to a considerable scale. The current economic reform plan is national and comprehensive. If we only look at Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, and not at these remote towns, we will not be able to get a full picture of the effectiveness of the economic reform plan. The reporter hereby reports in detail on the various manifestations of "Economic Reform's First Month" in Guiyang, as follows:

The Guiyang branch of the Central Bank issued gold yuan bills one day later than major cities across the country. According to the bank, on August 23rd, the car transporting the gold yuan bills failed to arrive in Guiyang from Duyun as scheduled, breaking down halfway in Machangping, and only arriving in Guiyang late at night. Therefore, the issuance only began the next day (24th), handling the exchange of gold, silver, foreign currency, and legal tender. Initially, it was only designated that the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would be responsible for the exchange. However, the bank, considering that all banks had been closed for four days and that those waiting to exchange would inevitably be crowded, temporarily added the Farmers Bank, Postal Savings, Cooperative Treasury, and Guiyang Provincial Bank to jointly handle the exchange. The crowding of the first two or three days of the exchange was, of course, inevitable, especially for silver dollars, followed by gold, and then foreign currency, because on August 19th, the price of silver dollars in Guiyang was only 3 million legal tender for head silver and no more than 2.6 or 2.7 million for mixed silver, and gold was 320 or 330 million legal tender per tael. Unless they were fools, no one would be willing to go to the national banks to exchange.

The seventeen or eighteen commercial banks in Guiyang felt the most headache at this time, because the checks or deposit slips issued on August 19th had to be paid in gold yuan cash in accordance with the law, and exchanged at the Central Bank, purely based on the head positions stored in each bank, without any flexibility. And at this time, depositors were

withdrawing cash one after another, facing both internal and external pressure. Therefore, general commercial banks invariably opened their doors late and closed them early in the first two or three days, and managers and cashiers kowtowed and bowed in all directions, trying to maintain stability. Among them, "Ju Kang Bank" even took out a check "only for transfer, not for cash payment" in the confusion, and issued it in gold yuan, falling into the hands of someone who knew the law very well, and later spent a lot of effort to make it right.

The Central Bank's statistics for the four days of August 24, 25, 26, and 28 (i.e., the first week of exchange) showed that 2,268.732 taels of gold, 46,161 silver dollars, 2,429 US dollars, and 600 Hong Kong dollars were exchanged. Most of this amount was made up of silver dollar small plates, public school teachers, or the families of high-ranking officials who still knew how to obey the law. Naturally, the bosses of large silver shops engaged in gold and silver trading also used a very small part of it to smooth things over with the national banks, but the amount was really negligible, and the Central Bank, on the other hand, was not ideal in terms of personnel and technology for identifying the fineness of receipts and ornaments, which was enough of an excuse for those holding large amounts of gold and silver to hesitate. Especially in the first two weeks, the Central Bank did not begin to receive silver ingots, which they had a legitimate reason for (because they lacked specialized technical personnel and tools to identify silver ingots), but it greatly hindered the execution of the law on the exchange of gold for national ownership and the deadline for exchange, and Guizhou Province has always been one of the provinces that practiced the use of silver. This problem was not resolved until September 13, when the Central Bank began to receive silver.

Gold merchants in Guiyang, in the Jiangxi gang, Shaanxi gang, and Sichuan gang, more than 30 silver shops, have considerable funds. They not only trade gold and silver, but also trade Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, department stores, and cloth. They don't hesitate to set up more brands and do everything that can make money. On August 19, the price of gold in Guiyang was 320 to 330 million per tael. After the currency change order, it became 600 million per tael. They still thought it was not enough, so they spread rumors out of thin air in secret, sometimes saying that the black market in Shanghai had reached 800 million, and sometimes saying that the black market in Chongqing had reached 900 million. Their stores only took in, but never sold. Rumors spread quickly, and not only did people with a little gold jewelry not go to the Central Bank to exchange it, but even people without gold jewelry were willing to go through the black market for 700 to 800 million and buy a few coins of gold jewelry to preserve it. Gold was like this, and so were silver dollars. In Guiyang, except for Hong Kong dollars, which had market news, US dollars were rarely mentioned. Therefore, the Central Bank's second week of exchange statistics showed that the gold exchange was less than a quarter of the amount exchanged in the first week (actually only four days), only 504.370 taels. The third week barely exceeded a third of the second week, only 152.696 taels, which was even more disparate than the first week's four-day exchange amount. Fortunately, the Provincial Capital Police Bureau and the Guiyang Municipal Government requested instructions from the Provincial Government, and decided to take action to promote the silver industry to quickly bring all the gold and silver to the national banks to exchange for gold yuan, in order to implement the law. On the morning of September 12, they divided into eight working groups and simultaneously inspected the larger silver shops in a lightning-style manner. As a result, 217 taels of gold jewelry, six gold bars, 922 catties of silver bars, and 152 silver dollars were found in the Li Wenxing, Lao Baoqing, and Lao Baocheng gold shops and their old cabinets. In addition, there were 30 various gems, and Lao Baoqing also hid 11 bundles of white cloth and 4 packages of Indigo, said to be 93 pieces of cloth for storage, and obtained suspicious documents for selling gold jewelry at high prices. This has always been the manipulation of Guiyang's gold market

The gold tigers Yuan Dequan, Li Mantang, Li Haisheng, Gan Huanlin, and Lü Xuehai were captured and transferred to the Provincial Security Command for interrogation. As expected, after the economic reform plan was supported by this political force, the Central Bank's fourth week of gold exchange immediately rose in a straight line, from 152.696 taels in the third week to 444.406 taels. Silver dollars, silver, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars were all ten times and six times more than the third week. After the Guiyang gold tigers were captured, the financial market gradually became calm.

However, Xiao Chunqiu Evening News was careless in cutting and pasting, and on September 14, it reprinted the Chongqing September 8 Dagong Evening News "Five-Cent Silver Dollars Temporarily Not in Circulation" news. Citizens mistakenly thought that "Five-Cent Nickel Coins Temporarily Not in Circulation." In less than half a day, people were panicked, and the market refused to use them, almost causing a major storm. Fortunately, the authorities took appropriate measures, immediately summoned the person in charge of the newspaper, and punished the newspaper by suspending publication for one month. On one side, the Central Bank issued an official message, earnestly correcting it, and the market returned to normal. Recently, because the copper coins of half a cent and two cents have not been formally announced by the Central Bank headquarters to be in general circulation, but a large number of them are circulating among the people, disputes still arise from time to time. Although this problem is not of great importance, it is still a problem that has not been resolved.

The gold yuan notes currently in circulation in Guiyang are mostly ten yuan and five yuan notes. One yuan notes are rare. Fortunately, a large number of nickel coins were left here during the War of Resistance, and there is no problem with market change. However, various counties in Guizhou Province feel very painful, and civil transactions are particularly inconvenient. Recently, the Central Bank decided that the one yuan gold yuan notes and one or two cent subsidiary notes should be as much as possible

Transported to various counties for circulation, which may be a slight solution. Unfortunately, the postal remittance bureaus set up in various counties, regardless of the domestic remittance rate within the province or outside the province, are still higher than the exchange rate set by other national banks, which has not been able to fully cooperate with the county and township financial circulation, which is a fly in the ointment.

After the currency reform, the first problem that arose was prices. Prices in Guiyang, except for imported goods, have always been lower than in Shanghai. The reasons are that this is almost a purely agricultural economy, and people's lives are unusually frugal. Secondly, the exchange rate between Guiyang and Shanghai was abnormal at that time. If you exchanged 7.5 million legal tender in Guiyang, you could get 10 million in Shanghai, which means that merchants could earn 2.5 million for every 10 million just by doing exchange, so prices in Guiyang were lower. What's more, the price of gold and silver between Guiyang and Shanghai was very different, and the market price was always based on gold and silver and rice. After the currency reform, the law stipulated that prices throughout the country must be frozen at the local figures on "August 19." However, the price of gold and silver in Guiyang on "August 19" was almost more than double that of Shanghai. Now, using the law to make it consistent with Shanghai, no wonder those engaged in commerce, industrial production, or purely consumption, all unanimously expect prices to rise. Therefore, after the currency change order was issued, before the municipal government's price limit was determined, the entire city of Guiyang almost became a market without transactions, shouting prices randomly, and trying to purchase as much as possible, reflecting that the people's psychology had reached extreme anxiety.

At this time, the provincial and municipal authorities obtained very reliable information that "anonymous people" had remitted more than one million gold yuan from Guangzhou to Guiyang

To purchase materials. The Farmers Bank alone had 600,000 to 700,000 gold yuan. Merchants watched prices across the country and stubbornly refused to release them for more than two weeks. The authorities felt that the law on freezing "August 19" prices could not be implemented, and feared that after the materials were smuggled to Guangzhou, the Guiyang market would not be able to be maintained, so they conducted extensive discussions. As a result, it was decided that "all goods imported from outside the province would be priced according to the price at the place of origin, plus transportation costs to Guiyang, plus legal profits," and "all goods produced in the province would be priced according to the wholesale price at the place of origin, plus transportation costs to Guiyang, plus legal profits," as the basis for price limits. Based on this principle, the average daily necessities were increased by 40% to 50% compared with the "August 19" price, and the goods produced in the province were increased by an average of 70% to 80%, and some even exceeded more than double. For example, the price of rice on "August 19" was 13 million legal tender per dou, which was increased to 27 million yuan, equivalent to 90 cents in gold yuan. This is really the chairman of Gu Zhenglun's helpless effort to protect the province's agricultural products and improve the lives of farmers. Even so, merchants still do not release materials. Until today, either materials are smuggled, or substandard goods are used to get by, and even meat shortages and rice shortages are becoming more and more serious. A phenomenon occurred the other day in which poor people jumped into the river and committed suicide because they could not buy rice.

The reason for this phenomenon in Guiyang is that merchants do not understand the essence of the economic reform plan. For example, the Municipal Council, which is meeting these days, openly only knows the interests of merchants. With the serious rice shortage these days as the topic, it uses its "compassionate" tone, seemingly attempting to first abolish the rice price limit as a foundation for overturning all price limits. They decided at the first meeting on September 20 that "rice will not be subject to price limits for the time being," and immediately wanted Mayor Zhang Zhixiang to accompany them to the Provincial Government to

achieve the purpose of temporarily not limiting prices. Although it was through the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government (Gu Zhenglun traveled to Qianxi Dading) Pan Xiyuan, to come up with a one keep the price limit, let the high-grade rice be natural" mysterious conclusion. The meeting also resolved at the third meeting yesterday (22nd): "I hope the municipal government will change the past rigid control of food prices and give prices a little flexibility," and "do not let the police interfere again." In this era of "democracy" singing loudly, the municipal government had no choice but to accept and implement it. Therefore, since the 22nd, rice merchants have been smiling and rice has been appearing one after another. The price is one yuan and five jiao for high-grade rice, and the difference is one yuan for medium-grade rice. The so-called low-grade rice or brown rice is simply not available, and the government's limited nine jiao and one dou has become a thing of the past. It is fortunate that the rice shortage problem has been solved.

After the rice problem is solved, the citizens' attention is now shifting to the meat and vegetable shortage phenomenon, hoping to be relieved accordingly, and some municipal councilors believe that the supply of rice and pork has some connection, and both come from the countryside, so they should be removed eliminate the price limit. The municipal government said that it should still be strictly limited and will no longer "lean on them". What is deeply worried by people of insight is that Guizhou is an agricultural economy, and the prices of all goods and services have always been based on the price of rice. Now that the rice price limit is cancelled and free transactions are allowed, all prices and labor prices may be cancelled, which will increase the difficulty of implementing the economic reform plan. I hope that the relevant parties will quickly find a remedy.

### Gunfire Causes Misunderstanding, Three Ningbo Police Officers Killed

Tragedy Occurs in Guan Haiwei, Cibei

[Our Correspondent, Ningbo, 28th] At about 4:00 AM on the 26th, the Guan Haiwei Police Station in Cibei dispatched several police officers to patrol the Jiang area in front of the garrison. Coincidentally, the search brigade of the Suppression of Rebellion Task Force was also patrolling the area. The two sides had not agreed on a signal beforehand. It was late at night, and it was impossible to distinguish between soldiers and bandits. Suddenly, gunfire was heard, causing a misunderstanding between the two sides, and they fired at each other. After both sides realized what was happening, they stopped firing. Three police officers had been shot and killed, and one resident was injured.

### On Jintang Island, Dinghai, Deserters Kill Platoon Leader, Carry Guns and Fall into the Sea, Escape Far Away, Whereabouts Unknown

[Our Correspondent, Ningbo, 28th] At 9:00 PM on the 24th of this month, the Sixth Company of the National Army's Xiong Battalion stationed on Jintang Island in the Western District of Dinghai suddenly suffered a mutiny.

### Will Henan University Return to Kaifeng? Henan People Prevent Southward Move, A Disturbance Occurs at the Station

[Our Correspondent, Kaifeng, 26th by Airmail] Although National Henan University is not a famous university in the country, it is the highest institution of learning in the culturally backward Henan. Before the War of Resistance, it was known for its school buildings, books, and instruments. After the restoration, it was known for its food and fighting. It cannot attend classes for a few days a year. In June of this year, it caught up with the fleeing. After Kaifeng fell, the Ministry ordered the school to resume classes in Suzhou. Therefore, faculty and students successively ran from the flames of war in Kaifeng to the scenic Suzhou. From then on, students of Henan University can be seen everywhere on Tiger Hill, in the Lion Grove, by the Canglang Pavilion, and in the West Garden Temple. Because there is no place to live and attend classes, the students are puzzled. Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wuxi are also full of students from Henan University. The Ministry of Education repeatedly ordered the school to resume classes as soon as possible. Although the person in charge of the school said that school would start on September 15, then said that school would start on October 15, and finally said that school would start in November, but Vice Minister Tian of the Ministry of Education said discouragedly: "At this rate, I'm afraid classes won't start in December"! The people of Henan, watching their children lose their schooling, and the books and instruments bought with the hard-earned money of the people of Henan being moved to the south of the Yangtze River, really feel sorry. A month ago, they called for Henan University to move back to Kaifeng, saying that Kaifeng was gradually stabilizing. The Provincial Council advocated the most strongly. They shouted loudly: "If the Central Government feels that it is necessary to add a university in Suzhou, the Ministry of Education can allocate funds to set up a National Suzhou University. The books and instruments of Henan cannot be moved to the south of the Yangtze River"! What makes people feel most sorry is the magnificent school building of Henan University that remains empty in Kaifeng. Recently, the Henan University authorities sent personnel to Kaifeng to escort books and instruments south. (Note: This batch of items was originally intended to be transported south, but was detained at the station by the people of Henan.) The Kaifeng Station had to allocate the train because it was ordered by the Ministry of Education. So, while hanging the car, it also informed the Provincial Council. After receiving the letter, the Provincial Council immediately sent a letter to the Provincial Government to prevent it. The Provincial Government then sent the Provincial Police Bureau to detain it. A superintendent of the Provincial Police Bureau led 20 police officers to the station to negotiate. When they arrived, the train had already been fired up and was about to depart. The 20 police officers immediately lined up in front of the train to prevent it from leaving, and at the same time asked the station to immediately unload the items of Henan University. The Henan University escorts came out to argue. After a long time, the passengers on the train were eager to leave. After finding out the reason, 500 or 600 people voluntarily got off the train and unloaded the six carriages of the Henan University train, and shouted: "Why should the things of Henan be transported to the south of the Yangtze River? Whoever doesn't let us unload the car, we'll hit their heads"! After the car was unloaded, it was inspected and found that in addition to books, instruments, and medicines, there was also a large package of cotton. It was heard that the last time it was and, when the car was unloaded, it was also found to be transporting sunflower seeds and peanuts. People are even more dissatisfied with this. At present, this issue is still deadlocked, and it is difficult to predict how it will be resolved in the future.

### Unprecedented Natural Disaster in Qinghai

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Sima Bing

[Dispatch from Xining, Qinghai, dated 24th of this month] Since the beginning of summer, Qinghai province has been successively afflicted by severe drought, hail, black frost, and sandstorms. The rural economy is already on the brink of collapse. Unexpectedly, in the last ten days of last month, various regions were subsequently hit by fierce winds and torrential rains, resulting in mountain floods. The affected areas were widespread, causing the most severe natural disaster seen in recent years.

Eve of the Flood

A low-pressure system fiercely struck Qinghai around the 21st of last month. The first to suffer were Huangyuan and Guide counties, followed by Huangzhong and other counties. By the 25th and 26th, the disaster had spread throughout the province. On the eve of the flood in Xining city, around 9 p.m., dark clouds densely covered the sky, followed by a sudden downpour. At the same time, violent winds raged, accompanied by thunder and lightning. Crops were instantly destroyed. Large trees with diameters of one to two feet were uprooted by the wind, standing upside down like dragonflies. Smaller trees were snapped at the waist and blown over a distance of one or two li. In an instant, houses collapsed and walls crumbled, and heart-wrenching cries filled the air! The next day, the heavy rain subsided slightly, and mountain floods erupted in various places. Infrastructure related to national defense construction and people's welfare, such as highway bridges, culverts, canals, and power plants, suffered enormous damage, especially national highways, provincial highways, and major roads, ninety percent of which were destroyed. The large-scale water conservancy projects "Chang Sheng," "Qing Kai," "Ping An," and "Ge Gong," which had just begun construction this year, were all destroyed.

Farmers Weeping in the Fields

The Qinghai artificial forests, renowned throughout the country, lost over two million trees of all sizes washed away in this torrential rain. Farmland was flooded, covered in sand, and silted up. Homes, stacks of soybeans and wheat, and livestock were washed away or drowned, a truly heartbreaking sight. Prior to this, black frost fell repeatedly in various places, causing all crops awaiting harvest to freeze and wither completely. According to reports, more than 30 townships in seven counties, including Huangyuan and Tongren, were affected. In Huangyuan County alone, the affected area was 4,460.2 mu, resulting in no hope for the autumn harvest. Elsewhere, prolonged drought occurred without rain, and crops were affected by diseases and pests. Reports to the provincial government included Huangzhong, Datong, and Guide, covering fourteen townships. In Huangzhong County alone, the affected area reached 41,736.68 mu, with damage exceeding 80 percent. Farmers, young and old, wept in the fields.

A Summary of Losses

According to preliminary statistics from the provincial government, the direct damage caused by this heavy rain includes the following with regards to roads, bridges, and culverts washed away by mountain floods: 114 bridges, 13 culverts, 95 sections of road surface and foundation, 6 ferry boats, and 10 ferry skins. Farmland flooded by mountain floods covers more than 20 townships in five counties, including Xining and Ledu, with over 5,200 mu of farmland flooded, almost entirely silted up with mud and sand. Approximately 200 public and private buildings collapsed. Telecommunications equipment damaged by lightning strikes includes two switchboards of 30 and 20 lines respectively, 5 desk phones, 2 wall phones, 670 utility poles, and approximately 320 jin of electrical wire. The Xining Hydroelectric Power Plant suffered losses of 3,950 gold yuan in this heavy rain. Had it not been for timely repairs, the entire city would have been plunged into terrifying darkness. The losses of over 20 large and small canals, including "Fang Hui," are difficult to estimate. The four canals currently under construction, including "Chang Sheng" and "Qing Kai," alone have already consumed more than 800,000 yuan in currency.

The Start of Repair Work

In order to urgently seek the recovery from the disaster, the relief of the victims, and the revitalization of the province's economy, the provincial government convened an emergency meeting for three days, attended by the heads of various agencies and organizations in the city, the mayors of various counties, representatives of public opinion, members of the provincial legislature, local gentry, and principals of primary and secondary schools. All agreed that the top priority was to repair the roads and restore transportation, and decided on the principle of "no new roads, keep the old roads open." A detailed plan and steps were formulated, requisitioning labor, materials, tools, and transportation from the entire province (i.e., laborers had to provide their own food, fuel, cooking utensils, tents, etc.) to actively carry out repairs. This repair work began on the 21st of this month, and the government appointed the mayors of each county as supervisors. Chairman Ma Bufang stated: "As long as the people of the province, with our spirit of doing things poorly, practically, quickly, and firmly, actively engage in the progress of various projects, we will surely achieve satisfactory results!" In our imagination, the people of Qinghai, under the outstanding leadership of the authorities in the past, were able to complete the Qinghai-Tibet, Qinghai-Xinjiang, and other highways, which are important national defense routes, in a short period of time, creating a miracle in Chinese highway construction. Now, these repair projects should be as easy as turning one's hand.

Important Recovery Measures

However, although the blood vessels of the body are open, the local symptoms should not be allowed to spread and worsen. The reconstruction of other projects in the province, the repair of canals, the replanting of artificial forests, the relief of disaster victims, the reduction and exemption of land taxes, and the replenishment of livestock are all important measures related to national defense and the rural economy, and must be urgently restored. However, Qinghai has a sparse population and financial difficulties. Although the provincial government has telegraphed the central government to allocate 5 million gold yuan in emergency relief funds, it may be enough to relieve the immediate crisis, but it is not enough to plan for recovery. Autumn in the Northwest is short, and a cold and long winter is coming. We face hundreds of thousands of victims shivering in the autumn wind, and we understand the situation in Qinghai, sandwiched between Xinjiang and Tibet. For the sake of people's livelihood and national defense, we need the authorities and the people of the whole country to extend a hand of sympathy and assistance!

### Prices Are High, Goods Are Scarce: Premium Japonica Rice Has Buyers but No Sellers, Flour Market Remains Stagnant, Edible Oil Remains Firm

The rice market is firm, with little change in prices across the board, but the arrival of goods is increasingly reduced, mainly due to high prices in the production areas, resulting in insufficient stocks in Shanghai. Yesterday, the total arrival of goods in the North and South markets was only 967 shi, and the market supply has also become even scarcer. Premium japonica rice has buyers but no sellers, with slight activity in medium and lower-grade rice. The supply of indica rice has also decreased, with only milled indica rice having some transactions, while other varieties are only subject to inquiry.

Flour

Remains inactive, with factories only able to ration sales to retailers due to the scarcity of raw wheat, and no longer able to supply the market. Retailers only receive 20 packages per day, which is not enough to meet retail demand.

Grains

Transactions are scarce, and supply is declining daily. Soybeans are in short supply, and the market is bullish. Corn is sold by few, with limited transactions according to restrictions. Buckwheat is selling well, red sorghum is still offered at 10 yuan, peas are actively sold to the north, broad beans have limited transactions, sesame is stable, and raw peanuts are slightly higher in price.

Edible Oil

Remains firm, with soybean oil supply still good, so price restrictions have not been imposed. Factories are also offering it at a slight increase of 0.20 yuan, to 49.20 yuan. Rapeseed oil is 46.20 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil has risen 1.5 yuan due to lower arrivals. Pure raw oil remains at the original price, and small cart sesame oil is offered at a restricted price. Soybean cake remains at the restricted price of 4.60 yuan across the board.

### Sugar Market Soft

The sugar market was firm yesterday, then weakened again. Because the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has already distributed its allocation, the industry has reached a saturation point. Retail sales on the street have also been slow, and selling pressure has increased in the market. The market sentiment is very weak, and the market lacks the strength to rise.

The 20th-period Taiwan Raw Sugar warehouse receipt opened at 24.80 yuan. As sales became sluggish and inventory registration was processed, holders rushed to sell, and the price gradually declined, reaching a low of 24.20 yuan at the close. Coarse sand and medium sand were down 0.50 or 0.60 yuan each. Numbers 4 and 5 refined white sugar lingered in a weak range for a long time and closed with a soft tone. Xinghua white sugar and Xinghua red sugar had no activity. Cotton white sugar from this factory and other brands also showed weakness.

### Promising Outlook for the Tea Market

Yesterday, domestic sales of red and green tea were more active than before. In addition to the continued steady demand from Suzhou and Wuxi, Yutai Tea Company and others on this street also added to their holdings in small quantities, so transactions gradually improved. As for the tea market for foreign companies, Qimen black tea, which is highly valued by England, has been officially traded in part after Concord and Jardine Matheson have been actively negotiating with the owners. However, most of them are mid-range goods, priced from 175 gold yuan to 205 gold yuan per dan. It is reported that Wing On Company is also interested in this variety. As for Tunlv Dabang and other varieties, sellers are reluctant to sell easily due to the scarcity of goods, and although exporters intend to purchase smoothly, it is difficult to fulfill their wishes.

### Record-Breaking Amount of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Exchanged

[Report from this newspaper] As the deadline for exchanging gold, silver, and foreign currency approaches, citizens have been crowding to exchange them in recent days. The total value exchanged on the 27th reached over 24.9 million gold yuan, setting a new record for gold and silver exchange.

(1) Gold: 71,536.407 taels
(2) Silver: 51,795.94 taels
(3) Silver dollars: 229,047 yuan
(4) Silver coins (20 cent pieces): 287,376 dimes
(5) US dollars: 2,353,667.74 dollars
(6) Hong Kong dollars: 718,457.66 dollars
(7) Philippine pesos: 2,339 pesos

The total amount of gold yuan exchanged: 24,926,734.475 yuan.

### Export Goods Market Overseas Remains Generally Firm

According to the Export Control Commission, the market for our export goods overseas this week (September 20th to 25th) remains generally firm, and major items are showing good performance. Unfortunately, domestic production area prices are higher, and transportation from production areas to ports is difficult, which contributes to the difficulty of procurement. The individual situations of the main export items are recorded as follows:

Tung Oil: Production area quotations are stable, but arrivals are still low. The overseas market has slightly increased in price due to the implementation of export price limits. According to a telegram from the Bank of China in New York on September 23, tung oil in that area has reached US$0.21 per pound.

Bristles: Market conditions fluctuate. Domestic prices are greatly affected by purchases from non-industry people. The overseas market is performing well. According to a telegram from the Bank of China in New York on September 23, the US dollar prices per pound for various bristles are: Tianjin long bristles, asking price US$11, bid US$10; short bristles (2 inches), asking price US$6.55, bid US$6.45; 26-count bristles, asking price US$5.30, bid US$5.00; Dianqing bristles, asking price US$2.77, bid US$2.70; spotted bristles, asking price US$2.30, bid US$2.25. Exporters with inventory can complete transactions.

Tea: The market is selling steadily, prices in the production area are high, and arrivals are decreasing. Although exporters are eager to buy, their asking prices are too high, and foreign companies are holding back, making trading difficult. The overseas market is calm. Premium Qihong tea is US$0.25 per pound FOB Shanghai, and Tunlv tea is still US$0.30. Based on the current overseas market prices, exports will incur losses, but there is still overseas demand.

Raw Silk: Domestic and overseas market prices are roughly balanced. Grade D is still US$2.80 per pound FOB Shanghai. The production of fresh casings is increasing, and export volumes are still good. Based on current market prices, exports can still be transacted. The biggest difficulty for cement exports is the lack of packaging materials. The Council has already obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to import 1.5 million paper bags from overseas to meet the needs of major cement plants in the country. Cement exports are expected to expand in the future.

### Export Control Commission Expresses Opinions on Promoting the Export of Goods

The Importers and Exporters Association recently submitted a request to the government to promote the export of goods, including: (1) Maintaining a reasonable price relationship between the production area and the distribution center for export prices; (2) Prohibiting non-industry people from manipulating export goods; (3) Improving the current state of export transportation; (4) Waiving confiscation of inventory that has not been purchased for over three months under contracts already signed with foreign companies. This reporter asked Chen Junren, director of the Export Promotion Office, about this matter. According to him, the Export Control Commission has already signed its opinions and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for improvement. (1) Maintaining a reasonable price relationship between the production area and the distribution center for export goods is related to national price control laws. However, for export goods that are not needed domestically, such as bristles, tung oil, and casings, the allowable limit for price increases will still be permitted if exports can still be profitable. In this way, merchants in the production area can sell, and exporters have export goods to purchase. Regarding this point, consultations are being made with the Economic Supervisory Office. (2) The Export Control Commission does not intend to suggest any rigid regulations to the authorities to prohibit non-industry people from manipulating export goods, but hopes that export associations will unite and organize closely, and the Export Control Commission will assist from the side. (3) The authorities have long been paying attention to improving export transportation. (4) Secretary Gao of the Supervisory Office stated that if exporters can present contracts signed with foreign companies that can prove the case, the goods can be exempted from confiscation.

### State-Run Enterprises to Increase Dividends to Promote Stock Sales

[Report from this newspaper] The Central Bank has decided to increase dividends in stages and to publish the asset and liability contents of various business units in order to gain public trust in order to strengthen the promotion of state-run enterprise stocks. It is now learned that the method of increasing dividends has been formulated by the Central Bank and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Once approved, it can be announced. The exchange problem for the sale of state-run enterprise stocks in Taiwan Province has also been resolved, and the Taiwan Bank will be able to sell them next month (February).

### National Cotton Joint Purchase Committee Approves Cotton Prices in Various Regions

[Report from this newspaper] The National Cotton Joint Purchase Committee held its third meeting at the National Bank yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Chairman Li Lixia presided over the meeting, and the following important matters were discussed and approved: (1) The final approval of cotton price lists for various regions will be sent to the Economic Control Committee of the Executive Yuan for approval, and then a unified order will be issued to all regions to comply. The price-limited locations include Shanghai, Hankou, Shashi, Xi'an, Ningbo, and the suburbs of Shanghai such as Zhoupu, Minhang, and Taicang. (2) The cotton prices discussed this time take into account the cost of the production area and the interests of farmers, so as not to affect the purchase volume. (3) There are two prerequisites for the success or failure of the Joint Purchase Office: (A) In addition to those participating in the joint purchase, those who want to go to various places to purchase their own goods must also abide by the price limit, and there must be no behavior such as raising prices or tampering with scales. Violators should be punished. (B) Local governments must strictly implement the price limit work.

### Cotton Yarn Trends Stable, Cloth Transactions Brisk, Prices Equal to the Previous Day

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was weak first and then stable. The price of 60-count double-strand Jincheng fine yarn was 1,280 yuan, up 10 yuan from the previous day. 32-count Jincheng was 850 yuan, also up 10 yuan. 40-count fine yarn was stable, and 21-count Double Horse yarn sold more actively, reaching a high of 783 yuan, an increase of 23 yuan. Three or four types of coarse yarn fell into the limit range, and most of the rest were still transacted according to the limit. 16-count had little change, and 10-count and 6-count coarse yarn were up 1 or 2 yuan to 3 or 4 yuan.

Also, the Fangjian Company continued to offer 20-count Red Bee, still selling for 700 yuan. Also, the Tongyi Yarn Factory offered 200 large packages of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn, priced at 700 yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market: in the morning, retail investors rushed to sell, and because the authorities have once again prohibited individual merchants from carrying cloth out of the country, the Fangjian Company's sales had an abundant supply. The initial price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell by 0.50 yuan, and then gradually fell to 25.70 yuan. By the time it was about to close, transactions turned brisk, and the market rebounded suddenly, rising to 26.60 yuan, which was 0.20 yuan higher than the day before. Finally, it closed at 26.40 yuan, the same as the previous day.

Longtou B-character fine cloth was favored by buyers, rising 0.60 yuan. Low-end fine cloth also showed good performance. Yuan biji, patterned biji, Zhigong and other varieties also had a bullish market. However, dyed cloth and Shilin cloth remained at the original price. Transactions throughout the day were particularly smooth, with a total of 3,740 pieces traded.

Also, the Fangjian Company offered Wufu B fine cloth, priced at 23.60 yuan, Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong ne at 29.50 yuan, and Sijunzi white printed Yuan biji at 26.60 yuan, prices which were 0.10 to 0.30 yuan lower than the market. Other items included Tiaoli Yuchou umbrella cloth, Yuan fine cloth, and miscellaneous colored fabric, with a total of 14 varieties.

### Rayon Transactions Lackluster

Since the price limit was imposed on rayon, transactions have become lackluster. The silk weaving industry's needs are rationed by the China Trust Bureau, and the industry's sales are rationed by the association. There are no official transactions in the market. Familiar brands are still rare. Miscellaneous brands such as Snea and Xuetalong No. 120 have a small supply and are transacted according to the limit. The quantity is extremely small. Various brands have prices but no goods, and the market is very sluggish.

### Ministry of Education Convened University Presidents' Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Improving the Allocation of University Funds, Hu Shi Suggested 60% for Salaries and Meals, 40% for Research and Construction, Simplification of Professor Qualification Review Also Discussed

[Report from this newspaper in Nanjing, dated 28th] The Ministry of Education convened a symposium of university presidents from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 27th. Information on the issues discussed and studied at the meeting has been obtained from relevant parties: (1) Hu Shi's proposed plan to improve the allocation of school funds. The content explains that currently, 80% of all school funds are used for the salaries and meals of faculty and students, and only 20% are used for academic research and construction. It is hoped that the allocation ratio can be improved, with 60% used for salaries and meals and 40% used for research and construction. Before the war, faculty and student expenses accounted for 50%, and research and other expenses accounted for 50%. Mr. Yu, the writer, believes that this plan is reasonable and feasible, but in reality, the proportion of funds occupied by faculty and students is indispensable and necessary, so new sources of income must be opened up in order to achieve the goal of 40% for research and other expenses. (2) Regarding the review of professor qualifications, it is planned to formulate measures in the future to strive for simplification. (3) The review of students' school registration upon admission and the qualifications of graduates will also strive to simplify procedures. (4) Teaching and management planning issues were discussed, and opinions were exchanged to strengthen implementation.

### National Secondary and Higher Education Institutions Part-Time Teaching Fee Payment Method: Professor Maximum of Eight Yuan Per Hour

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Education's subordinate secondary and higher education institutions' teachers and staff part-time hourly fees are paid according to the local cost of living index standards. The method was previously revised and implemented on February 9, 1948, with Order No. 8094. Now, due to currency reform, starting from August 1948, all public education personnel salaries have been changed to be paid in Gold Yuan notes. All previous hourly fee payment standards are no longer applicable. The Ministry of Education has revised them according to the current public education personnel salary method, and it will be implemented starting from August 1948. The payment method for part-time hourly fees for teachers and staff of national secondary and higher education institutions is as follows: (1) If a school does not have enough teachers and must have its own teachers and staff take on part-time teaching duties, their part-time hourly fees will be paid according to the standards stipulated in this method. If the school has already hired enough teachers according to the approved quota, no one else may take on part-time teaching duties or receive part-time hourly fees. (2) Part-time hourly fee standards are as follows: (1) For colleges and universities, the maximum Gold Yuan notes per hour for a professor is eight yuan, for an associate professor is seven yuan, and for a lecturer is six yuan. (2) For secondary schools: the maximum Gold Yuan notes per hour for a senior high school teacher is five yuan, and for a junior high school teacher is four yuan. (3) For normal schools, vocational schools, and other training classes, the payment standard will be based on their nature and will be compared to the payment standards of schools at various levels. (3) Calculation method for hourly fee payment based on hours: Each semester is calculated as five months, each month is calculated as four weeks, and every four hours is calculated as one hour. (For example, in the "Fourth District" of the Beijing-Shanghai area, if a professor teaches part-time for four hours per week, the monthly part-time hourly fee will be 32 Gold Yuan. For professors teaching part-time in schools outside the "Fourth District" of the Beijing-Shanghai area, the part-time hourly fees will still be paid according to the approved zoning salary standards for August 1948, with the addition or reduction percentage for each zone. For example, if it is in the third zone, 45% should be added, which is 46 yuan and 40 cents. If it is in the fifth zone, 10% should be subtracted, which is 28 yuan and 80 cents.) (4) Part-time teaching is limited to four hours per week according to regulations. If a teacher or staff member of this school teaches part-time within four hours per week in addition to their required hours or duties, the part-time hourly fee will be paid according to the standard. Those who teach part-time at other schools for four hours or more may not teach part-time at this school again or receive this hourly fee. (5) These part-time teachers will be referred to as part-time professor, part-time associate professor, part-time lecturer, and part-time teacher, respectively. (6) Teachers' and staff's part-time fees should be paid and reimbursed within the school's salary budget and no special funds will be allocated. (7) This method will be implemented starting from August 1948.

### Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy

— Jingwen

Based on sayings like "vast in territory and abundant in resources" and "long-standing culture," we do indeed have many things to boast about in terms of science and technology, such as the invention of the compass, papermaking, and gunpowder. Moreover, our ancestors were indeed very attentive to craftsmanship and technology. Sayings like "If a craftsman wishes to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools" have already comprehensively explained that our ancestors deeply understood the philosophy of craftsmanship and technology. Furthermore, specialized books that recorded craftsmanship and technology, such as "The Artificers' Record" and "Exploitation of the Works of Nature," further prove the ancient people's emphasis on craftsmanship and technology.

However, looking around at our generation, in the field of craftsmanship and technology, we have clearly fallen behind terribly. People living in a large industrial city like Shanghai may not fully realize this phenomenon, because all the advanced products of world industry, such as airplanes, ships, automobiles, trains, various machines and their products, are all available in the city. For people who go out to take airplanes and sit in cars to go to the office, they rarely can comprehend the terrible backward position we are in in world craftsmanship and technology. And this generation happens to be our "national pillars and social cornerstones," wouldn't you say that's terrifying?

This is not to say that our country has absolutely no scientific and technological talents in recent years, we have plenty of talents. For example, Dr. Qian Sanqiang, who has recently given academic lectures in various parts of the country, has gained world renown for his academic contributions to atomic theory. There are also many talents in other specialized advanced technologies. However, the problem lies in the general and balanced development of craftsmanship and technology. Whether or not a country's national economy is strong is the key to a country's strength or weakness, which has long been an indisputable argument. Whether or not a national economy is strong must depend on a country's economic production capacity, which has also long been a settled argument. However, what determines a country's production capacity cannot rely on a few geniuses or a few experts. Geniuses are indeed exceptions, and experts are also national treasures, but the technical knowledge and production capacity of the majority of people is the determining point of a country's truly strong economy.

However, our shortcoming now lies precisely in this aspect. Even in the industrial city of Shanghai, which has a population of five million, the number of true industrial workers is probably not large, and the number of those who can automatically and carefully devote themselves to improving craftsmanship is even smaller. If we say that we are still an agricultural country, but now we have to rely partially on "relief rice" from industrial countries for survival, isn't that terribly sad? Although it's a long story, the fact that agricultural technology has not improved for thousands of years cannot be denied.

This problem is too big and involves too much. However, I personally have a feeling that the decline of national character has a great relationship with the inability to advance in craftsmanship and technology. For example, although we have not made much progress in scientific inventions and discoveries in recent centuries, we are quite good at using means such as stealing, trickery, and deception, such as counterfeiting, stealing labor and reducing materials, modeling, and alluding. For example, someone counterfeited a certain injectable medicine from a certain Swiss pharmaceutical factory. Although it was a counterfeit, it could not be detected in Shanghai, and it had to be sent to the Swiss factory to determine that it was a counterfeit. This shows that even though it is a counterfeit, it is quite clever. If they were willing to devote the energy spent on counterfeiting to research on inventions and discoveries, they would surely be able to achieve real gains. Now, abandoning this right path and not following it, it cannot be said that it is the result of the decline of national character.

In addition, the fact that our cultural route in recent centuries has been too focused on the abstract aspect of the spirit is also a major obstacle to the development of craftsmanship and technology. Although the empty-headed culture of the imperial examination era has become a thing of the past, the promotion of sound, light, electricity, and strong armor and sharp weapons at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China is still just empty talk. In the past, people ridiculed us as a "country of words," are we not still like this? Taking the issue of "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science," the most lively thing in newspapers and magazines is still the issue of "Mr. Democracy." Perhaps some people believe that only after the issue of "Mr. Democracy" is resolved can we talk about "Mr. Science," but I always feel that this view is questionable. If there is no help from the strength of "Mr. Science," I am afraid that "Mr. Democracy" can only be lively on paper forever.

Since the War of Resistance against Japan, the call for increased production has been heard for a long time. However, without first increasing the production skills of the people, without awakening the people's ambition for craftsmanship and technology, these calls will become more and more empty. However, in today's society where a few people can become rich overnight by turning their hands over, is it still possible to encourage people's progress? This is indeed a big question. In this way, the issue of "Mr. Democracy" is indeed more important than "Mr. Science." However, I believe that only when these two gentlemen join hands and advance together can the issue be truly resolved. Now, at least everyone has a concept about the issue of "Mr. Democracy," which is indeed a gratifying phenomenon; what is hoped is that the public will not be too indifferent to "Mr. Science," because the final master in the future must be this gentleman.

### Like a Dream

— Gu Fei

West wind returns with a snap of the fingers,

Insect sounds around the steps are drunk,

Glad to feel the coolness on the pillow,

Trivial matters keep me awake.

Rise, rise,

The moon is like water!

### Butterfly Loves Flowers

Changing all the fragrant grass paths in the world,

Sleeping deeply every morning, forgetting the twilight autumn scenery.

Don't be jealous of the slanting setting sun,

Dusk gradually approaches the trees in front of the courtyard.

Not seeing the fleeting time pass,

Red face in the mirror, nowhere to be found in the blink of an eye!

Easy for fallen flowers to drift independently,

What's more, enduring the startling wind and rain.

### Drive-In Theaters

Every summer night, about 825,000 Americans sit in their cars watching movies. These open-air cinemas where audiences sit in their own cars, Americans call them Drivin (tentatively translated as "drive-in theaters"). These theaters were initially just crude lots that could squeeze in a hundred or so cars, with loudspeakers blaring noise. Now, they have been improved to accommodate 700 to 1,000 cars, with specially built inclined ramps for cars, directly facing the silver screen, and two separately controlled in-car talking machines.

New-style "drive-in theaters" have amusement parks, pinball arcades, and picnic tables. One "drive-in theater" near Covington, Kentucky, in addition to showing movies, also provides the following free entertainment for the audience: watching fireworks, horseback riding, and boating.

Children under twelve are admitted free, so in many "drive-in theaters" you can see that except for one adult driving, the entire car is filled with children. However, the theater owners don't care. They want people to know the benefits of patronizing "drive-in theaters." Here, the audience can smoke, chat, or eat popcorn without disturbing those around them. There is no parking problem, and no need to dress up neatly in the hot weather. Obese and disabled people who find it inconvenient to go to indoor theaters flock to "drive-in theaters."

"Drive-in theaters" have been around for fifteen years, but their development has been most vigorous in the past year. The founder was a young chemical manufacturer named Richard M. Hollingshead Jr. from Camden, New Jersey. In May 1933, he organized a company, with the financial support of his cousin, and built the world's first "drive-in theater" near his hometown, which could accommodate 500 cars. Although the equipment seems simple today, at the time it was a very comfortable way to watch movies.

Other engineers followed suit, and by the time the United States entered the war, there were 52 "drive-in theaters," with another 62 under construction or planned. Although film companies only supplied them with some old movies at the time, the operators still earned a total of three million yuan each year.

Wartime gasoline rationing almost strangled "drive-in theaters," but by mid-1946, they were active again. Now there are 546 "drive-in theaters" across the United States, accommodating approximately 275,000 cars. Their annual net profit is estimated to be about 28 million yuan. At the current rate of construction, by 1950, the United States will have more than 1,000 "drive-in theaters."

"Drive-in theaters" are becoming more and more considerate of their audience's needs. One offers free warming of baby bottles. Several have dog kennels, providing free services for audiences who bring dogs. And one is the most thoughtful: housewives who go to the theater to watch a movie can leave their laundry in a special shed. When they come out after watching the movie, the theater has already washed and dried the items and returns them – but this service requires an additional charge.

### Peeking into the Bridal Chamber

— Yi Yun

I have already recorded the story of students from a certain school catching thieves in the Ben Tan section of the newspaper on the 26th. Now I will record another interesting incident involving those same students. One day, a student got married, and there was the custom of "peeking into the bridal chamber" (that is, at night, secretly going to the bridal chamber to eavesdrop, learning all the words and deeds of the newly married couple, and then announcing it to the public the next morning for laughter and to demand candy). The students, being young and fond of mischief, naturally enjoyed it. That evening, they groped in the dark, took off their shoes, and sneaked over, so as not to be heard by the newlyweds. However, as they approached the window of the bridal chamber, they felt that every step had fine sand, touching the soles of their socks and making a squeaking sound. They brushed it away with their hands, but it was there again when they stepped down. After eavesdropping for a long time, they only saw the groom circling the room. Later he went behind the bed, and only came out after a long while. However, he was hidden by the bed curtains, so they didn't know what he was doing. Soon after, the groom took off his clothes and got into bed, while the bride had already leaned lazily on the sofa, and each fell into a sound sleep. They waited until almost dawn, gaining nothing. Moreover, hungry mosquitoes were biting their skin, and they could no longer wait, so they went back together. Unexpectedly, when descending the stairs to the landing, one foot suddenly stepped into water, deep enough to submerge the shin. Only then did they realize that they had been tricked. Someone had placed a basin of water there early on. The first to step into the icy water did not make a sound, fearing that those behind would become aware and turn around to laugh at them. The next person also stepped into the water and still did not speak. The last person jumped down with both feet, fully entering the water. They rushed back to the dormitory, but unexpectedly the door was already locked from the inside, and they could not get in. So they sat together in the courtyard. The night was cool and piercing to the skin, and their socks and pants were wet, making them extremely cold and shivering. The mosquitoes were also biting them, and they could not bear the fatigue. At dawn, they looked at each other and suddenly realized that they were all black, mottled like ghosts, and looked extremely ridiculous. Only then did they realize that the fine sand in front of the window was coal dust secretly spread by the groom, and that they had brushed their socks with their hands and slapped mosquitoes on their faces, and then scratched them, resulting in this. And the water basin at the bottom of the stairs was also placed by the groom, who had secretly slipped out through the door behind the bed to do it. The students were hidden by the curtains and could not see his trick. This groom was extremely cunning.

### Simplicity

— Qian Dacheng

Ever since Zhuge Wuhou (also known as Zhuge Liang), Marquis Wu, proposed the two sentences in his "Admonition to His Son" - "Without simplicity, there is no way to clarify one's ambitions," and "Without tranquility, there is no way to achieve far-reaching goals," many people have regarded "simplicity" as the highest realm of human cultivation. Yan Jidao (Yan Fu) even said that the meaning of these two sentences of Marquis Wu was derived from Laozi. This further showed that simplicity is invaluable. The "pure-hearted person" mentioned by Tao Yuanming is actually a person who is simple and does nothing.

"Simplicity" is indeed rare. Being able to view wealth and status as floating clouds and pursue what one loves in life is truly the so-called pure happiness. But at the same time, some people are loudly calling out: "Can one not be wealthy and noble in life?" Knowing that "wealth and status are like dew on the grass," but life is like grass and trees. Without a little moisture from sweet dew, it will wither and languish to death. In years of war and chaos, it is more difficult to obtain the minimum enjoyment than it is to obtain high office and generous salary in times of peace and prosperity. Therefore, Gong Ding'an (Gong Zizhen) had to say: "Talented men in middle age indulge in silk and bamboo, and hermits in lean years despise fine silk gauze. Both feelings are understandable, and autumn pens should not overly criticize them."

To talk about "simplicity" in times of chaos is actually a high-sounding tune shouted out in desperation to relieve ridicule from the pressure of life. If "simplicity" cannot lead to "tranquility," how can it "clarify one's ambitions" or "achieve far-reaching goals"? People who are truly capable of simplicity will never shout out the words "simplicity" from their mouths. - I feel that Fan Bozi (Fan Zhongyan) was more straightforward when he said: "Knowing early on that simplicity breeds烦恼 (fánnǎo, worries), why did I not simply indulge in madness at the time." Even if you can endure hardship willingly, how can you bear the pain of "family members all reproaching me"? Therefore, some people are saying: "Being a clean official is doable but not doable, while being a corrupt official is undoable but doable."

I am not looking down on "simplicity," but instead of just shouting "simplicity" in vain, it is better to grit your teeth and endure it with relish.

### Gold and National Fortune

— Zhu Zhenjiang

According to reports, the gold reserve for the issuance of the gold yuan currency in China today is 2,767,103,587 ounces (Editor's note: This number is based on the Central News Agency report after the issuance of the gold yuan currency, and all newspapers recorded the same number. However, in fact, there must be an error. Even considering that the issuance amount of the gold yuan currency is only 2 billion, in fact, such a gold reserve is not needed). The silver reserve is 41.37 million ounces. This is the amount of gold and silver owned by the national treasury, while the amount of gold and silver hidden among the people is like the weight of a tripod, which cannot be asked about. However, we see that the amount of gold recorded in history books in China is more in ancient times and less now, cheaper in ancient times and more expensive now. This can be observed from the jin and liang (traditional Chinese units of weight). In the past, when Su Qin persuaded the King of Zhao, the King of Zhao bestowed 10,000 yi of gold. The annotation in the Book of Han says: In the Qin dynasty, one yi was one jin, and in the Han dynasty, one jin was one jin of gold. When Chen Ping persuaded the King of Han, the King of Han gave him 40,000 jin of gold and allowed Ping to do whatever he wanted, without asking about income and expenditure. Some say 100,000 jin, as seen in Zhu Xuan's Collected Records. When the King of Liang Xiao died, the treasury had a surplus of more than 400,000 jin of gold. When Wang Mang died, 60 cabinets, each containing 10,000 jin of gold, were found in the province. When Dong Zhuo died, there were 30,000 jin of gold in the Wubao. In addition, the cases of rewarding with gold were also numerous. Emperor Wu bestowed 100 jin of gold to Dongfang Shuo. He also rewarded the soldiers who followed Wei Qing in expeditions to the frontier with as much as 200,000 jin. Emperor Xuan bestowed a total of 7,000 jin of gold to Huo Guang. Emperor Xiaowen of Wei bestowed 8,000 jin of gold to Bao Dudu for his funeral.

As for the Six Dynasties, silver was still measured in jin, while gold was measured in liang. Emperor Wen of Sui bestowed 150 liang of gold and 150 jin of silver to Zhou Fashang. This is the only known case where jin and liang were mentioned together. Zhao Yi Kao said that the practice of measuring in liang started in the Liang dynasty. When Emperor Jing of Han surrounded the city, Yang Kan led troops to defend it, and the emperor ordered the delivery of 5,000 liang of gold and 10,000 liang of silver to reward the generals and soldiers. After that, it was generally referred to as liang. Chen Zhouluo was rewarded with 3,000 liang of gold and silver each for his merit in breaking the siege of Pengcheng. Sui Liangyan was rewarded with 3,000 liang of gold for his merit in pacifying Jiannan. Lai Huer was rewarded with 1,000 liang of gold for defeating Yang Yuanyuan. From this, it can be seen that the practice of measuring gold and silver in liang had already started in the Northern and Southern Dynasties.

During the Song dynasty, the country was weak and the people were poor, and the amount of gold decreased significantly. In the Biography of Du Hao in the History of the Song Dynasty, Emperor Taizong asked why the bestowals in the Western Han dynasty were all in gold, but gold had become a rare commodity in modern times. Hao replied: At that time, Buddhism was not yet flourishing, so gold was cheap. In fact, Emperors Huizong and Qinzong still offered 200,000 liang of gold and 2,000,000 liang of silver to the Jin dynasty to beg for peace. But comparing liang with jin, it is not known how many times less it was. Now it is used to beg for peace, so it cannot be compared with bestowals. Because one comes from natural bestowal, with surplus resources at hand, while the other is done out of necessity, and one cannot but seek it forcefully.

During the Ming dynasty, the central government was昏庸 (hūnyōng, muddled and incompetent), and eunuchs seized power, privately seizing gold and silver, and their collections were extremely rich. The Small Record of Knowledge records that in the Zhengde reign, when Liu Ying's family was confiscated, there were 12,507,800 liang of gold and 25,958,360 liang of silver. The Seven Cultivation Categories also says that during the Zhengde reign of the Ming dynasty, there was the eunuch Liu Jin before and the commander Zhou Ning after, both of whom had sole control of power. When their family properties were confiscated, Liu Jin had 240,000 ingots and 57,800 liang of gold, and 5 million ingots of silver, etc. And the amount of gold stored in the national treasury at that time was also not small.

During the Qing dynasty, the amount of gold and silver confiscated from He Shen's family was negligible compared to that of Liu Ying. It was only over 26,800 liang of gold hidden in the walls. This is about the same as the amount secretly hidden by the great traitor Yan Song in the Song dynasty. The Record of Ice Mountain in the Sky satirized Yan Song's downfall, when his family was confiscated, there were only 30,000 liang of gold and over 3 million liang of silver. Perhaps he deposited a larger amount in the inner and outer treasuries, which was even more than Liu Jin and Zhu Chong (the Small Record of Knowledge records that Zhu Chong's family had 50 million liang of silver). After all, the power and cunning of traitors far surpassed that of eunuchs.

In summary, from the dynamics and numbers of gold, we can see the strength or weakness of the national power. And from the bestowal, acceptance, and storage, we can also get a glimpse of the rise and fall of the national fortune.
