### Valiant Nationalist Troops Advancing Rapidly to Suppress Bandits: The West Liao Corridor Imminent to Be Cleared; Siping Facing the Eve of a Major Offensive and Defensive Battle

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 3rd] The local populace is eagerly awaiting reinforcements. Although the Ping-Shen (Beiping-Shenyang) Railway is open to civilian traffic near Xinmin in Shenyang, bandit activity between Xinmin and the Daling River remains rampant. Military authorities announced: The Air Force has been conducting continuous sorties bombing the urban area and coast of Yingkou for days, possibly as a prelude to the landing of reinforcements. The Siping offensive and defensive battle is about to commence. The bandits' front line is at Shuangmiaozhi and Mangniushao Railway Station to the south of Siping, and at Yehe Station to the southeast. Bandit concentrations are also numerous to the southwest of Siping. Siping is on the eve of a major battle. Furthermore, thousands of bandits are moving from Yingkou and Anshan in southern Liaoning towards Benxi. On the evening of the 2nd, bandits infiltrated areas southwest of Benxi. The situation in Benxi is currently at a stalemate. (Excerpt from the "Weekly War Situation Overview" released by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, published on the left corner of the second page.)

[Our Correspondent in Gui Sui, 3rd] It is rumored that in order to salvage the critical situation in the Northeast, Fu Zuoyi has dispatched the Daqingshan Cavalry of the Chahar-Suiyuan Field Army to the Northeast. Furthermore, to counter the Nationalist cavalry, the Hebei Communist bandits have transferred the Kang Jianmin Brigade to Hebei. The traces of the Kang bandits have not been seen in the Jin-Sui border area for two months.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd] A strong force of Nationalist troops entering from Shanhaiguan is advancing rapidly along the Beining Line towards the Northeast, clearing out bandits along the way. With overwhelming force, they have successively recovered strongholds such as Dahushan, Goubangzi, and Juliuhe. The West Liao Corridor will soon be cleared.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] Since the news of Nationalist reinforcements entering Shanhaiguan, the bandits entrenched north and south of the Liao River have shown signs of wavering in the past two days. Moreover, with the increasing pressure from our westward-advancing forces, the bandits are now fleeing back to northern Liaoning in disarray. Their attempts to threaten the outskirts of Xinmin and Shenyang have been thwarted.

[United Press, Beiping, 3rd] Nationalist forces reported today: The left wing of Fan Hanjie's army corps has advanced from Dahushan and recovered Heishan today. However, the situation in Tieling is serious, and trains from Shenyang cannot reach the area.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] Wang Huayi, Zhang Baochi, Tian Yushi, Li Zhonghua, Mi Chunlin, Wang Shuchang, representatives of the Northeastern People's Petition Delegation, along with Zhang Yuanfu, representative of the people of Beiping and Tianjin in the Northeast, Ma Liang, representative of the people of the Northeast in Nanjing, Zhang Xuansan, Zhou Huowen, Liu Zanzhou, Qi Mingfan, and Wan Fulin, began petitioning the Executive Yuan and the Central Standing Committee on the morning of the 3rd and reported on the situation. Vice President Wang and Secretary-General Gan received them at the Executive Yuan, and Wang Huayi attended the Central Standing Committee to report. They submitted petitions and proposals to both institutions, explaining the actual situation. Wang Yunwu replied on behalf of the Executive Yuan that the documents would be transferred to relevant departments for study and a definite response would be given in the short term. After hearing Wang's report, the members of the Central Standing Committee believed that the principles could be fully agreed upon, but the implementation methods would depend on the Executive Yuan's handling by relevant departments. Wang Huayi and others visited Defense Minister Bai Chongxi at 4 PM to reiterate their views on saving the critical situation in the Northeast and returned at 5 PM. It is reported that Bai Chongxi responded to Wang and others at the time, stating: The government's established policy towards the Northeast is unwavering. Please rest assured and trust that the government has the determination and the means. Furthermore, Ambassador Stuart will host a luncheon for Wang Huayi and other representatives of the Northeastern Petition Delegation at 12:30 PM on the morning of the 4th.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] The Northeastern Petition Delegation's submitted proposals to various parties focus on six key areas: military provisions, currency system, local armed forces, refugee relief, and the selection and appointment of civil and military officials. The oral reports and proposal submissions to relevant authorities are progressing well, as seen in the activities of the 3rd. Furthermore, the petition delegation has received telegrams from various quarters, some encouraging them, and others asking them to convey their respects to the central government. It is learned that the Songjiang Provincial Association in Shenyang sent a telegram mentioning the issue of building local armed forces, indicating that Songjiang Province is prepared to do so and has nominated Xiao Zhaolin and Guan Ruiji to lead the effort. At the same time, they reported that they have united the people of six provinces and two cities north of Songjiang, who unanimously support the construction of local armed forces. In addition, the Songjiang North and Liaonan Pacification Zones' Six Provinces and Two Cities Association in Shenyang sent a telegram stating: The situation in the Northeast is critical, and the central government is urged to take immediate action to save the situation and implement the four proposals. (The delegation's suggestions regarding the improvement of Northeast's financial issues are published in the first column of the second page.)

### Remnants of Chen Yi's Forces in Western Shandong Encircled; The Nationalist Army Will Soon Launch an Annihilation Campaign

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 3rd] The remnants of Chen Yi's 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns, which have been encircled in western Shandong, are still trapped in the area east of Juye, including Longguji, Jidoushan, and Hongchuankou.

### The Chinese Society for Social Research Holds a Meeting to Discuss China's Political and Economic Path; Advocates for Institutionalization of Politics and Democratization of Institutions

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 3rd] The Chinese Society for Social Research, initiated by Qian Changzhao and others, was officially established on the 1st. Yesterday, the society held its first general membership meeting, attended by over forty people. The meeting discussed key points regarding the society's overall position on China's politics, diplomacy, economy, and society, roughly as follows: A. Political Aspects: (1) The basic principles are to institutionalize politics, democratize institutions, and socialize democracy. (2) Rule of law replaces rule of man, selecting people based on institutions, not creating institutions based on people. Equal emphasis is placed on law enforcement and law-making, with constitutional governance being more important than the constitution itself. (3) Government agencies should have independent status within their statutory authority and be legally responsible to the people. (4) Establish a civil service system. Except for political appointees, personnel in government agencies should not engage in political activities. (5) The army belongs to the nation, and soldiers should not interfere in politics. Soldiers who enter politics must first renounce their military status. (Continued on the first column of the second page)

### MacArthur Advocates Military Aid to China; Has Responded to Invitation to Testify

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Colonel Benk, an aide to MacArthur, announced: Regarding Representative Eaton's invitation for MacArthur to express his views on aid to China, MacArthur submitted his response on the evening of the 3rd. He stated that his response may accept the invitation but did not reveal whether his response mentioned MacArthur's views on aid to China. He said that it must wait until Eaton announces this in the United States before it can be announced in Tokyo. [Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The Allied Headquarters in Tokyo has remained silent on MacArthur's attitude towards the invitation from Washington to provide his views on U.S. aid to China to Congress until noon on the 3rd. However, it is generally expected that MacArthur will submit a memorandum expressing his views on the U.S. position in Asia.

Some observers believe that MacArthur might welcome the opportunity to provide a comprehensive statement of his views. They also believe that this statement will be telegraphed to Washington within 24 hours to provide the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is currently considering the issue of aid to China. There is unanimous agreement here that MacArthur will, to the best of his ability, oppose the suggestion that he should personally travel to Washington, as the new Japanese government is about to be formed, elections are about to be held in Korea as decided by the United Nations, and explosive events may occur in China (anti-American sentiment stirred up by the Communist Party could erupt in China at any time). Therefore, MacArthur cannot leave the Far East, even for a few days. The content of MacArthur's memorandum on the China issue will remain strictly confidential until it is delivered to Washington. However, it is generally expected here that MacArthur will point out the following:

(1) The China problem is primarily a military problem and should be dealt with from this perspective. The United States should emphasize military aid to the Chinese government until the "pro-Soviet Communist movement is suppressed." A certain amount of economic and financial aid is a necessary part of the military plan, but the solution to the military problem needs to be kept in mind at all times. Once the military problem is solved, the Chinese government can restore sovereignty to the areas currently controlled by the Chinese Soviets, and then China can lay the foundation for economic and social development.

(2) The China problem should be observed in relation to the overall situation in Asia. From a geographical and military point of view, China is to Asia as Germany is to Europe.

(3) If the Soviet Union can control all of China, it is clear that Western democracies will find it difficult to prevent Japan, the Philippines, Siam, India, and other countries from suffering the same fate.

(4) The interests of the United States in the Western Pacific and eastern Asia are equal to the interests of the United States in Europe. Japan's conquest of the Northeast provinces and subsequent advance deep into the Chinese mainland was the main cause of the last world war. If the Soviet Union follows the same path

(5) Any consideration of the situation in China is best proven by the fact that the Chinese Communist regime receives its most important inspiration from Moscow and has become a "satellite state of Soviet totalitarianism."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee has received the following three proposals for aid to China: (1) The U.S. government's proposed 15-month emergency goods program of $510 million and a long-term program of $60 million. (2) A three-year industrial revitalization plan proposed by the U.S. with $939 million, stipulating a first-year allocation of $573 million, and an unspecified amount of military aid.

### General Wedemeyer to Testify as Well

Lawyer Alman Urges Aid to China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] General Wedemeyer will appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the morning of the 3rd to testify on the issue of aid to China. The committee has not yet received replies from General MacArthur and Chennault, stating whether they will personally return to the United States to present their views on aid to China. 1

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Alman, a former American lawyer in Shanghai, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 2nd, saying: China does not need another aid plan that is merely for relief, but needs a constructive and practical industrial recovery plan, stipulating five items: stabilizing the currency system, revitalizing agriculture and industry, restoring transportation, military aid, and immediate economic assistance. Chinese bankers hope to restore the coin standard. In order to achieve this goal, they need to borrow approximately 600 million ounces of silver from the United States, and banknotes must stop being printed.

### The Committee for Handling Relief Materials Decides to Fund Public Hospitals

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Materials held a routine meeting on the 3rd, during which it reviewed various plans proposed by the committee's health, medical, and pharmaceutical committee, which will soon be implemented. The most important plan is to use medical equipment and temporary medical subsidies from American relief materials to subsidize central and municipal hospitals in the seven major cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, as well as government hospitals in the ten provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Chahar, and Rehe, so that these hospitals can provide emergency medical relief to the poor, sick, and refugees. There are also plans to implement prevention and control measures for tuberculosis, cholera, and plague.

[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 3rd] The Tianjin American Relief Materials Distribution Committee was formally established on the 3rd to prepare for widespread distribution in coordination with the Civil Food Distribution Committee. 5,600 tons of flour from American relief materials have been shipped north in three batches, two of which have already arrived in Tianjin.

### Kuomintang to Convene the Fifth Plenary Session

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] Sources say that the Kuomintang will take the opportunity of the Central Committee members coming to Nanjing to attend the National Assembly to convene the Fifth Plenary Session. Regarding the nomination of candidates for President and Vice President, the Kuomintang will also hold a meeting to discuss and decide before the National Assembly convenes.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held a routine meeting on the morning of the 3rd, chaired by Zhu Jiahua, and passed the following resolutions: A. The deadline for re-registration of party members, originally the end of February this year, has now been decided to strengthen publicity and extend the deadline to the end of May this year. B. Regarding the downsizing of the Central Party Headquarters, it was resolved to reduce it to one-half of the current number of staff.

### Bullitt Testifies Before the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Strongly Argues for the United States to Face the Crisis in the Far East; Requests Another Special Envoy with Understanding of Political, Economic, and Military Affairs to Come to Our Country

[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Bullitt testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 2nd regarding the aid to China bill (the main points of Mr. Bullitt's speech were published in yesterday's newspaper), criticizing the State Department's "blindness and indifference" towards China and strongly advocating the passage of the proposed economic aid to China bill. He said: "The amount of this economic aid, if effectively managed, should be sufficient in purely economic terms. The rules for management should be flexible enough to allow funds originally intended to purchase certain materials to be transferred to purchase other materials when necessary."

He disputed Secretary of State Marshall's testimony regarding the quantity and quality of munitions that the United States has supplied to the Chinese armed forces. He said that Marshall's figures were inaccurate.

Bullitt requested that a "special envoy who understands political and economic affairs and also understands military affairs" be sent to Nanjing. He suggested General MacArthur, the current Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan, or General Clark, the former commander of the Allied occupation forces in Austria, as possible candidates.

Bullitt said: "Our nation is in danger. The Soviet Union's strategy for conquering the world is based on the premise that the Soviet Union's strength is not yet sufficient to risk war with the United States, but it must build its domestic war potential and place the resources and people of new strategic areas under its control before attacking us. Therefore, the Soviet Union has strengthened its control over 130 million European people since 1939. Using the actions of the fifth column, it attempts to acquire France and Italy, using the Communist Party as a tool to conquer China by war."

He warned: "If the Soviet Union controls China, it will be able to cast a shadow between the Asian continent and Japan. Not only does Japan depend on the Asian continent for food and raw materials, but also for the majority of its manufactured goods' markets. This will make it impossible for Japan to maintain its economic life unless it prostrates itself under the Iron Curtain and becomes a Soviet satellite state. Communist control of China will lead to Communist control of Japan. China is the throat of the entire Far East."

Bullitt pointed out that the China issue arose from ten years of war, first against Japan and then against the Communist Party. He said: Approximately 80% of the Chinese government's expenditures are used for military purposes. Therefore, the military situation is bound to control the economic and financial situation, because military defeats will lead to total loss. The error in American foreign policy is that it mistakenly recognizes the Soviet Union as a peace-loving country and implies that there is no connection between the Communists and Moscow, believing that most of them are land reformers.

After inquiry, he said that the solution to the China issue will require a long time, but he warned that a situation may arise in the future that will cause the United States to "face a solid Communist front from the Bering Strait to Singapore." He said that the money needed to assist China to prevent this situation is relatively small compared to what is needed in Europe.

The Foreign Affairs Committee also heard from Alman, who previously worked in China as a diplomat. He said that what China needs is a "positive and realistic recovery plan, not any plan that is merely for relief." He said that this plan should include currency reform, the construction of agriculture and industry, and the restoration of transportation. Like Bullitt, he also advocated providing the Chinese government with military aid and immediate economic assistance.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] According to Bullitt's estimates, China can be revived in three years if it is given $450 million in aid each year in addition to military aid.

Representative Jackson suggested that economic stability in China is impossible while the state of war continues. Bullitt agreed with this point. He said that if sufficient military aid is provided, he believes that the entire Chinese Communist Party can be eliminated within three years. He said, "If small arms and munitions could be obtained in early April, Shenyang could be held."

Bullitt said: "I have great respect and admiration for President Chiang. President Chiang should be one of the top ten leaders in the world."

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] When Bullitt testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he was asked about the military importance of China avoiding Communist control. Bullitt replied: "I know that there is a vast new industrial area in Siberia, concentrated near Lake Baikal. Bombers can only reach that area if they take off from northwestern China, but if China falls into Stalin's hands, that large industrial area will be free from attack."

### The Four Banks Joint Council Postpones Discussion of This Year's Loan Methods

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] According to related sources: After the Four Banks Joint Council passed the general loan principles for the 37th year (including industrial loans, public transportation business loans, export loans, salt loans, and grain loans), the Four Banks Office submitted them to President Chiang for approval. The implementation methods will have to wait until the Four Banks Joint Council passes them before being submitted to the President again. Furthermore, the Four Banks Joint Council, which was originally scheduled to be held on the 4th, has also been decided to be postponed because the agricultural and industrial loan plans to be discussed have not been completed.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] The special task force of the Four Banks Office held a review meeting at 3 PM on the 3rd to discuss the issue of grain loans. Xu Baiyuan presided over the meeting. Liu Xingji, Director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food, Wang Junliang, Director of the Finance Department, Diao Peiran, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, Zhou Mengxin, Director of the Business Office of the Central Agricultural Bank, Ma Keqiang, Manager of the Bank of China, Zhu Tongjiu of the Bank of Communications, and representatives of the Ministry of Finance, totaling more than ten people, conducted a broad review of the issue of grain loans. The general opinion was that the goal of grain loans should be to stabilize grain prices, ease grain supply, and increase sales volume. The target of grain loans will focus on grain loans to local governments. Loans to grain merchants will be reduced as much as possible. In the past, grain loan methods included mortgages and escrow methods. Because escrow easily leads to hoarding, the meeting generally advocated the use of mortgage methods. Regarding how grain loans should be allocated to various locations, the general opinion was that grain loans to the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, which are implementing rationing, should be less than in other regions. In addition, the entire grain loan policy was reviewed, and opinions were exchanged on the issue of coordination between grain loans and agricultural loans. In principle, it was generally agreed that they should be closely coordinated, and it was advocated that grain loans should be linked to agricultural production increase plans. The review meeting lasted for three and a half hours and ended at 6:30 PM. All opinions will be organized by Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan and submitted to the next Four Banks Joint Council meeting for discussion. It is reported that the Standing Committee, in view of the current fluctuations in grain prices in various locations and the large number of local governments applying for loans to store grain, has specifically proposed this review in advance. After the Four Banks Joint Council passes the loan policy, grain loans can be opened.

### Northern Jiangsu's Yang-Huai Road Fully Open; Zhang Xuezhong Arrives in Baoying, Residents Along the Line Excited; Refugees Fleeing from the Battle of Fushui Urgently Need Relief

[Our Baoying Office, 3rd] Today, this reporter followed Commander Zhang Xuezhong of the 7th Pacification District to Baoying. Ten thousand people welcomed him with county flags and firecrackers along the road. Although the highway between Yangzhou and Huai'an was damaged by bandits, it was quickly repaired through cooperation between the military and civilians, and it will be completed on the 3rd. Commander Zhang has instructed the Yang-Huai Company to begin full operation of the entire Yang-Huai line. Zhang's arrival in Baoying has greatly excited millions of people along the Yang-Huai line. Zhang has decided to set up a pacification headquarters in the Caodian Cheqiao area east of the canal embankment and has appointed a certain regimental commander Liu to be responsible for the security of the Yang-Huai highway. All the military forces of Huai'an, Baoying, and Gaoyou counties are under the command of Regimental Commander Liu to ensure the safety of travel.

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 3rd] It is reported that on the 22nd of last month, bandit troops in northern Jiangsu disturbed Fushui. Local self-defense forces and civilians resisted with their lives, suffering extremely heavy losses.

In this battle, no fewer than 20,000 civilians escaped beforehand after receiving information and took the opportunity to flee during the fierce fighting, extending for 30 miles along the winding canal, scattering to Gaoyou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places. The refugees fled in haste, mostly without clothes or food, suffering from hunger and cold, a truly unbearable sight. Local people have telegraphed fellow villagers in Zhenjiang, asking them to appeal to relevant authorities for relief.

Commentary

### Democratization of Educational Administration

This year is the year of constitutional governance. To align with the need for constitutionalism, the Ministry of Education's Educational Research Committee sent letters to education scholars across the country, soliciting their opinions on establishing public opinion organs for education at all levels. The Chinese Education Society also resolved at its annual meeting to request the government to universally establish education councils at all levels. If this proposal is adopted by the government, it will undoubtedly become an epoch-making innovation in our country's educational administration.

What is an education council? It is an educational institution suitable for democratic ideals that has been gradually improved in advanced European and American countries over the past century. In the educational administration systems of European and American democratic countries, there are two parallel systems: one is the administrative system, which exercises administrative and examination powers in education, and its main functions are to implement education policies, investigate students, establish schools, certify teachers, provide teaching guidance, prepare budgets, and work reports; the other is the legislative system, which exercises legislative, judicial, and supervisory powers in education, and its main functions are to determine education policies, review education budgets, stipulate education tax rates, manage education funds, approve curriculum standards, select textbooks, appoint education officials at all levels, accept lawsuits from dismissed teachers, and supervise or impeach education officials and principals at all levels. In the administrative system, there are the Ministry of Education at the central level and education departments, bureaus, and sections at the local level; in the legislative system, there are the National Education Council at the central level and provincial, county, township, and village education councils at the local level, whose councilors are all elected by the public from people who can represent the interests of all levels and are enthusiastic about education. In totalitarian countries, there is only an education administrative system without an education legislative system; there are only the Ministry, departments, bureaus, and sections of education, without education councils at all levels. In democratic countries, the education administrative system must be controlled by the education legislative system; the Ministry, departments, and bureaus of education must obey the education councils at all levels. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, our country has never established a legislative body for education, so education administration has always remained at the stage of constructing a system. Education scholars with democratic ideas have long wanted to introduce the education council system of advanced European and American countries to China. More than twenty years ago, the author also suggested in the book "Research on China's New Education Administration System" to universally establish public opinion organs for education at all levels and to stipulate their organization and powers in detail, but at that time, it happened to be the beginning of political tutelage, and this suggestion failed to attract general attention because it was not in line with the times. Now, at the beginning of constitutional governance, the Chinese Education Society has resolved to request the government to universally establish education councils at all levels. Although its future is unpredictable, the author dares to assert that this is the beginning of the democratization of Chinese education administration.

What are the benefits of establishing education councils? The main goal of establishing such an institution is to democratize the education administration system. The so-called democratized education administration system is a system owned, governed, and enjoyed by the public. It is a system that is public-centered, uses public money, is participated in by the public, and is operated to seek the happiness of the public through education. In simple terms, it is a system that allows the public to participate in education administration. The benefits of this system are extremely obvious. First, the establishment of education councils can increase education tax revenue and prevent the misappropriation and waste of education funds. In democratic societies, the tax rate and method of taxation must be agreed upon by the taxpayers. To have the public spend money on education, it is necessary to make the public willing to pay. To make the public willing to pay, it is necessary to increase their interest in education. To increase their interest in education, it is necessary to give them the opportunity to actively participate in education administration. The establishment of education councils is to enable the public to participate in education administration, increase their interest in education, and be willing to spend more money on education. Furthermore, since education funds are managed by the education councils, ordinary administrative officials do not dare to misappropriate them, education administration leaders do not dare to engage in corruption, and the efficiency of education administration can also be improved as a result. Second, the establishment of education councils can prevent factional struggles and protect the careers and freedom of teachers. In authoritarian societies, education officials are responsible to their superiors. As long as they gain the trust of their superiors, their positions are as stable as Mount Tai, and they can form cliques, engage in private interests, and monopolize education. At the same time, the careers of education workers without factional backgrounds are not guaranteed at all. In democratic societies, education officials must be responsible to the public and must have the support of the education councils. Once they lose their credibility, they will be impeached and dismissed, so they cannot monopolize education unless they can monopolize the education councils, which is extremely difficult. At the same time, education workers who are forced to leave their jobs due to discrimination can appeal to the education councils. If they win the lawsuit, they can still return to their original positions, and their career and freedom of speech can be adequately protected. Fourth, the establishment of education councils can ensure that the education provided is for the welfare of the public. In the old society, national education only represented the special interests of a few aristocrats, landlords, warlords, and bureaucrats, because the public had no say in the determination of education policies, the compilation of curriculum standards, and the content of moral cultivation. In democratic societies, the authority of the public in education administration is higher than everything else. Education councils can decide education policies, review textbooks, and determine the content and methods of cultivation, so the interests of farmers, workers, and other classes are guaranteed in education policies and content. Public welfare becomes the touchstone of education values. Anything that can withstand the test of this touchstone can exist, otherwise it will be eliminated. Education participated in by the public can truly seek the welfare of the public and truly eliminate the feudal vestiges in education.

Can the establishment of education councils suit our country's historical traditions? Although education councils are an institution of advanced European and American democratic countries, there is no difficulty in transplanting them to China, because local education in our country has a long democratic tradition. Without mentioning the distant past, even the community schools and academies of the Ming and Qing dynasties had so-called executive committees, whose executives were publicly recommended by local gentry, and whose powers were similar to those of European and American education councils, such as raising school land and grain, repairing school buildings, managing school property, and hiring teachers or rectors. In villages where clans lived together, each ancestral hall had an executive organization composed of executives publicly recommended by clan members, and part of its powers was to manage ancestral land, establish private schools, hire teachers, and encourage young people in the clan to take exams. This is also a prototype of democratic education organizations participated in by the people. These excellent democratic traditions may have a history of more than a thousand years in our country's villages. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the education funds of Henan Province and Anhui Province were once independent, and education fund management committees were established, and their achievements were very remarkable, and their powers were very similar to those of the state education committees in the United States. As for the democratic education organizations in the countryside, the system implemented in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, can be cited as an example. Each village in the county has an "Education Society," whose cadres are publicly recommended by clan members, and whose powers are to raise school land and grain, repair school buildings, manage school property, hire teachers, and issue scholarships. Not only is admission to school free for children in the village, but each person can also receive two to five piculs of grain per year. Students in the village who are admitted to middle school can receive six to ten piculs of grain per year, and those who are admitted to university can receive twenty to thirty piculs of grain per year. Students who repeat a grade will not receive grain that year, and they will not receive grain after graduation. The organization of the Education Society is very common in the county, so the number of acres of school land accounts for one-tenth of the cultivated land in the county, and compulsory education has generally been popularized. It is heard that similar Education Societies are also organized in various counties in Hunan, so vocational schools are also very developed. Based on the above facts, we can imagine that the establishment of education councils is not to force the Western education system into China's social organization, but to inherit the excellent traditions of community schools and academies for more than a thousand years, synthesize the results of experiments in various places since the establishment of the Republic of China, and refer to the experience of advanced European and American countries to establish a more enriched and expanded education system. It has continuity with our country's historical traditions.

In summary, the establishment of education councils not only utilizes the valuable experience of advanced European and American countries, but also inherits our country's excellent traditions. If this system is properly implemented, it will definitely increase education tax revenue, improve administrative efficiency, prevent factional monopoly, protect education freedom, develop public welfare, and realize the education ideal of being owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people.

### Suggestions for Improving the Finances of the Northeast

[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The full text of the Northeast Petition Delegation's suggestions to the Executive Yuan and relevant agencies regarding financial and monetary improvement is as follows:

(1) The Current State of Finance and Currency in the Northeast. After the recovered areas of the Northeast successively fell, transportation was obstructed, materials were scarce, remittance was blocked, the currency was stifled, and as a result, prices rose, capital was insufficient, and turnover was ineffective. Currently, the Shenyang branch of the Central Bank has about 300 billion in outstanding payments. The Shenyang area needs to urgently purchase 210,000 bags of military grain for February, March, and April of this year, requiring about 160 billion yuan. The monthly expenditure of various military and institutional agencies is 300 billion yuan. When this representative came to Nanjing (February 25), there was an urgent need for 660 billion yuan in banknotes, but the branch only had 20 billion yuan in banknotes, a huge disparity between supply and demand. As a result, the following adverse consequences have occurred, greatly affecting the suppression of bandits: 1. Grain payments cannot be made, affecting the purchase of military grain; 2. Military grain cannot be distributed, affecting the morale of soldiers; 3. Salaries of public officials and all employees cannot be paid, affecting administrative and production efficiency. In addition to finding ways to allocate funds immediately to alleviate the urgent need, the government should at this time give serious reconsideration to the issuance of circulating notes. According to the information available to this delegation when it came to Nanjing, the national army can only control 48 townships (possibly even fewer now). It is unbearable for the people of 48 townships to bear all the military and administrative expenses. Even if the military is not defeated, the economy will inevitably collapse. Therefore, solving the problem of this circulating note is a matter of utmost urgency.

(2) Specific Remedial Measures: 1. Open remittance to absorb currency and allow it to flow back, so that each area can share the burden equally. Since the expansion of the rebellion by the treacherous bandits, the recovered areas only have over 40 townships, with a population of less than several million, making it unreasonable and impossible for them to bear all the expenses of suppressing the bandits. The suppression of bandits should be borne by all the people, and the Northeast should not be an exception. Furthermore, considering the current prices in Shenyang, which are three times higher than those in Beiping and Tianjin, and five times higher than those in Nanjing and Shanghai, it is actually due to the imbalance between the supply of materials and currency. If remittance is opened, prices in various places will not differ so greatly. Currently, prices in the Northeast are much higher than those in various places within the customs, actually due to the different monetary systems and remittance controls. Therefore, in order to save the economic collapse of the Northeast and affect the military suppression of bandits, the central government should immediately fully open remittance between various places inside and outside the customs, so that funds can flow into various places and balance the burden. 2. Stop issuing circulating notes so that existing circulating notes can be used interchangeably with legal tender and customs gold at a fixed value. When the Northeast was recovered, considering the special financial and economic situation in the Northeast, in order to adapt to the local situation, seek the stability of the people's lives, and stabilize prices, the Central Bank was specially allowed to issue circulating notes for the nine provinces of the Northeast. This was originally a temporary expedient measure. At the beginning of the recovery, it had a stabilizing effect on local finance. Now that times have changed, the Northeast has successively fallen, the people are impoverished, prices have risen, military demand is huge, currency is rampant, and the economy is out of balance. The central government should immediately stipulate a fixed ratio between legal tender and circulating notes, stop issuing them, allow free remittance, so that legal tender and circulating notes can be used in circulation inside and outside the customs, and stabilize finance, which will greatly benefit the suppression of bandits.

### China Social Research Association Discusses Our Political and Economic Path

(Continued from Page 1) (6) A democratic system must be based on the application of party organization. There should be parallel political parties in the country, criticizing and supervising each other, and each striving to win the support of public opinion. Political parties must not use any pretext to use violence to suppress dissidents. The final expression of public opinion is the transfer of elected power, which should be determined by the results of the election; (7) Elections should be based on districts, and the representatives elected by the people are responsible for exercising power; (8) The basic principles of local autonomy should be guaranteed by the Constitution. For matters of local autonomy, the central government can only exercise supervisory power within the scope prescribed by law; (9) Democratic politics should not only focus on form, but also pay attention to the practical benefits that the administration brings to the public. The democratic politics we want should guarantee the basic freedoms and rights of the people, ensuring freedom from fear, deprivation, oppression, and exploitation.

B. Diplomatic Aspects: (10) Use domestic coordination to seek diplomatic coordination; (11) Promote good-neighborly policies and establish an independent national policy; (12) Oppose racial discrimination, support small and weak nations, and respect their independent consciousness; (13) Oppose using war as an instrument of national policy. International disputes should be resolved peacefully based on justice and international law. Support disarmament and the establishment of an international control system. Support a sound international organization so that it can truly resolve disputes; (14) Support international economic and cultural cooperation; (15) Oppose any government or group manipulating speech, thereby creating international propaganda offensives and hindering international peace.

C. Economic Aspects: (16) Develop national resources, achieve full employment for all, promote fair distribution, and improve living standards; (17) Actively promote modernization and industrialization; (18) The ultimate goal is for all land in the country to be nationalized. We should first stipulate the maximum limit for private farmland, and land exceeding this limit should be nationalized, with the original landowners compensated with long-term bonds. The nationalized farmland should be rented to tenant farmers or collectively operated; (19), (20) Omitted; (21) Nationalize financial institutions, immediately recover private equity in national banks, and simplify and unify institutions; (22) Omitted; (23) Tax policies should be aimed at averaging private wealth, national capital, promoting resource development, economic prosperity, and achieving social security; (24) Omitted; (25) Welcome foreign investment that does not carry political implications and aligns with our economic policies, and participate in our economic construction on mutually beneficial terms.

D. Social and Other Aspects: A total of seven items, omitted.

### Song Ziwen Answers Questions from Reporters

(Continued from Page 1) Song replied to reporters' inquiries, saying: (1) Rice smuggling exports used to be 4,000 dan per day, but now it is only 1,000 dan. Strict prohibition has already been implemented. If anyone is arrested, no matter who they are or what power they have, they will be sent to the Northeast. (2) The suppression of bandits has now adopted an offensive strategy. The security in the Dongjiang and Hanjiang rivers is relatively poor, and large troops have been dispatched to suppress them. The strength of the large bandit forces can be completely eliminated in a few months. (3) Construction of Huangpu Port will begin this year. Zhang Jia'ao is very interested in this and has decided to complete it in phases. (4) The strict management system is causing a large amount of overseas remittances to escape to Hong Kong. Methods are being devised to prevent this, and it will not be difficult to restore overseas remittances. (5) The grain shortage in Shantou is serious, and efforts are being made to find solutions. In addition to the 30 tons allocated by the Social Affairs Department to Shantou, logical rice transported there can also be used for relief. Currently, Fujian Province has agreed to allow Guangdong to purchase 7,000 dan, and discussions are also underway with Taiwan for 3,000 dan. (6) The Hainan Island steel plant is also being actively pursued. He hopes to complete this matter during his tenure. (7) Although the Northeast problem is serious, he believes that the government can cope with it. With the spirit of resistance, all difficulties can be solved. (8) Investment in local industries in the province, as long as it is beneficial to the people's livelihood and economy, is welcome regardless of Chinese or foreign investors, but speculative and investment businesses are absolutely not welcome. Finally, regarding rumors that he will go to the Executive Yuan and the United States, he said that he is very willing to serve his hometown and that the above news is unfounded.

[Our Guangzhou Office, 3rd] Song Ziwen told reporters that after the realization of the 60 million US dollar US aid for improving the Yuehan Railway, in addition to improving the railway tracks and carriages, the Yuegan Railway from Shaoguan to Ji'an will also be built. In the future, material assistance between Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces will be greatly helpful, and materials from Jiangxi Province can also be transferred to the Yuehan Railway and directly reach Wuchang. He also believes that this matter will definitely succeed.

### Medical Association Representatives Meet in Nanjing

Now you are meeting again in the capital, just at the time of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. The atmosphere of the rampant bandits needs to be swept away, and the trauma of the people is deepening. It is even more necessary for your association to work together, mobilize unanimously, and enthusiastically devote yourselves to the traditional medical ethics of saving people and helping the world, to heal the wounds of soldiers and reduce the suffering of compatriots. At the same time, how to cooperate in promoting local health to seek practical results, and how to catch up with the new inventions of medical and pharmaceutical sciences in the world to seek progress, I hope that you all will have concrete plans and practical performance to live up to expectations and invigorate people's hearts and awaken the national soul.

### Vice Chairman Points Out Soviet Breach of Contract; Zeng Qi Expresses Deep Agreement; Sharpening the People's Hearts and Awakening the National Spirit

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Zeng Qi, a leader of the Youth Party, recently expressed his praise for the speech made by Vice Chairman Sun Ke in Taiwan on the 1st. Zeng stated: In his speech in Taipei on the 1st, Vice Chairman Sun Ke discussed Sino-Soviet relations, pointing out three ways in which the Soviet Union had wronged China: (1) failing to withdraw troops as agreed and removing industrial equipment; (2) failing to return Lushun and Dalian; (3) supplying the Chinese Communists with Japanese weaponry. His words were stern and righteous, and his attitude was clear. Zeng also said: The recent speeches by Mr. Sun Zhesheng (Sun Ke) and Mr. Hu Shi on the Soviet Union were extremely clear and forthright, truly sufficient to clarify "right and wrong" and set the "trend," sharpen "people's hearts" and awaken the "national spirit," which is deeply admirable. The year before last, in the autumn, I ventured out of customs despite illness to inspect the "Northeast after the Restoration." I personally visited Changchun, the scholarly community, and Shenyang, witnessing firsthand the reality of the Soviet Union removing industrial equipment and the remnants of destruction by the Communist bandits. I could not help but feel distressed and heartbroken, filled with grief and indignation. Taking the Shenyang Arsenal as an example, what I saw was: (1) The Fengtian Factory (operated by Zhang Zuolin and Yang Yuting), with a site of six square li, suffered losses of about 70% due to Soviet removal and Communist bandit destruction. (2) The Manchurian Powder Factory (established by the Japanese), with a site of over 5,000 mu, suffered losses of about 40% due to Soviet removal and Communist bandit destruction. (3) The Japanese 383 Unit Arsenal, with a site of over 16,000 mu, suffered losses of about 50% due to Soviet removal and Communist bandit destruction. (4) The Japanese 918 Unit Arsenal, with a site of over 3,000 mu, suffered losses of about 48% due to Soviet removal and Communist bandit destruction. Furthermore, the relocation and destruction of light and heavy industry were countless. I advocate that our government should publicize the facts to the world to seek a fair judgment from world public opinion. Unexpectedly, it has been delayed until now without implementation. Although the authorities' caution reflects painstaking efforts, the significant losses of the nation must ultimately be compensated. Vice Chairman Sun clearly pointed out the three points of Soviet breach of contract, with which I deeply agree.

[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] The U.S. Embassy announced today: The embassy "still has no comment" on the remarks made by Vice Chairman Sun Ke of the Chinese government regarding the Taiwan issue, but may issue a formal statement in the future.

### Shao Lizi's Statement

Regarding His Life During His Time as Envoy to the Soviet Union: An Editorial in a Certain Newspaper in the Capital Is Completely Groundless

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Mr. Shao Lizi read a certain newspaper in the capital yesterday, where the editorial stated, "Before the war, when Shao Lizi was the ambassador to Moscow, his entire salary was only enough to support his life, and it was not even satisfactory. Other staff members of the embassy suffered even more." He made the following statement: "First, I have never been concerned about my personal life, so I have never complained about my life not being satisfactory, not only during my time in Moscow. Second, my observations during my time in Moscow were compiled into the book 'Returning from the Soviet Union' after returning to the country, which can be reviewed. Third, during my tenure as ambassador to the Soviet Union, I returned over US$20,000 of surplus public funds from the embassy to the national treasury in three installments, which can also prove my living conditions during my time as ambassador. In short, the claims made by the newspaper, I do not know where they heard it from, but I have absolutely never made similar remarks."

### Price Drops Sweeping Tianjin, Wuhu, and Other Places

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 2nd] The Tianjin price surge after the Spring Festival, which was like wild horses running, suddenly subsided across the board on the 2nd due to stabilizing public sentiment, with food being the most significant. Each bag dropped by as much as 100,000, and the stock market was booming, with Kailuan, Qixin, and other stocks all reaching limit-up.

[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 3rd] With the easing of rice prices in Nanjing and Shanghai, Wuhu rice prices have retreated to 2.4 million yuan, and unpolished rice to 2.1 million yuan.

### The Speaker of the Nanchang City Council and Others Petition Yu Feipeng, Requesting Stabilized Rice Prices and Cessation of Grain Purchases

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 3rd] Hu Nesheng, Speaker of the Nanchang City Council, and others petitioned Grain Minister Yu Feipeng at 4 p.m. on the 3rd, requesting that the Ministry of Grain order the Jiangxi Grain Department to allocate 300,000 shi to stabilize rice prices and order the China Grain Corporation to stop purchasing grain in Jiangxi. Yu replied that he would discuss the Nanchang food supply with Wang Lingji and Nanchang Mayor Tang Xin and would not allow a food shortage to occur in Nanchang. However, last year, the provincial government allocated grain to stabilize prices during the lean season, which helped to overcome the famine season. Now, due to the urgent need for military grain, the provincial government has no surplus grain to stabilize prices. The China Grain Corporation originally planned to purchase 30,000 large packages of grain in Jiangxi and has already purchased 7,000 shi. The City Council has decided to ask the provincial government to stop the China Grain Corporation from purchasing rice for export. Yu has now agreed not to purchase any more in Jiangxi, but hopes that the 7,000 shi already purchased by the China Grain Corporation can be transported to Shanghai to regulate the food supply. Yu and others are scheduled to go to Xunyang and Wuhan on the 4th.

[Another Dispatch] Yu Feipeng discussed the strengthening of military grain purchases and transportation issues with the provincial government and the Grain Department in Jiangxi on the 3rd. The central government is purchasing 1 million large packages of military grain in Jiangxi, equivalent to 2,667,000 shi of rice. Since December of last year, 630,000 shi have been purchased. The remainder will be purchased at market prices from provincial and county-level public grain, and Fengcheng and 33 other counties will be designated as purchasing counties. The 17 counties and cities with the most grain production will be designated as mobile purchasing locations. However, Yu, due to the urgent need for military grain, requested the province to transport it all within three months, but the issues of concentration and transportation still need to be further discussed to improve methods. No results were achieved by late evening. Zhang Daomin, director of the Land Tax Department who came to Jiangxi with Yu, was still in discussions with the Ministry of Grain's personnel stationed in Jiangxi and the provincial government late into the evening.

### Hankou Command Headquarters Ordered to Establish a Grain Purchasing Association to Combat the Bandit Army's Attempts to Loot Grain

### The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense Releases A Summary of the War Situation for the Week; The National Army Fully Controls the Shenyang-Xinmin Front

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released a summary of the war situation for the week from February 25th to March 2nd on the 3rd. The full text is as follows:

Northeast: The focus of the war situation this week is still in the Northeast. In order to isolate Pan Yang, the bandits tried their best to cut off the Beining Road and control southern Liaoning. Because of the successful raid on Yingkou, the bandits in western Liaoning, in order to echo southern Liaoning, also concentrated the forces of four columns to attack Xinmin. On the one hand, they also transferred three columns to attack Kaiyuan, still wanting to threaten Siping. The purpose was nothing more than to take advantage of the fact that the Northeast had not yet thawed to consolidate the defense of the port in southern Liaoning and open up a land supply line from northern Manchuria to the south in order to prevent the National Army from launching a full-scale offensive after the spring thaw. Therefore, they did not hesitate to make significant sacrifices, concentrating artillery fire for fierce bombardment, and using human wave tactics and close combat.

After this all-out offensive, except for southern Liaoning and Kaiyuan, which the bandits were able to opportunistically invade and occupy due to the weak forces of the National Army and the difficulty in sending reinforcements, the bandits suffered heavy losses on the Xinmin and Juliuhe line. The various nearby columns are retreating to northern Liaoning. The front lines of Xinmin and Pan Yang are still completely controlled by the heroic soldiers of the National Army.

North China: In North China, the National Army launched sweeping operations this week. On the 28th, it recovered Yongqing County in the Pingjinbao triangular area and defeated more than 1,000 bandits from the Bohai Military District east of Duliu, recovering important strongholds such as Laojuntang and Chuanjiawo. At the same time, the National Army in Nankou also completely eliminated the bandit work group in the Re-Cha-Ji border area in the Thirteen Tombs area, and captured more than 30 bandits, including the bandit commander Gao Zhe. They are still continuing to pursue the main bandit force for suppression.

Central China: Chen Yi's bandit troops in Central China, after being chased by the National Army from eastern Henan, had to adopt a method of fleeing in separate groups. The exhausted bandit army is always trying to avoid engaging our side. In the past few days, its First Column fled south across the road from the old Kao City and suffered heavy blows, with more than 3,000 casualties. The main force of the Third Column and the Eighth Column fled from the area east of Yancheng on the Pinghan Line to the area between Yuxian and Xiangcheng west of the road. The Eighth, Tenth, and Eleventh Columns are fleeing in the triangular area between Zhecheng, Taikang, and Huaiyang. As for the Fourth Column, which is isolated in western Shandong, in addition to the Liangguang Column avoiding battle to reorganize, it is still trying to maintain Chen Yi's rear supply line. In order to strike at the main force of the bandit army, the National Army is currently searching and suppressing them in separate routes.

Liu Bocheng's bandit troops in the Dabie Mountain area are now approaching their final days and have become a battlefield remnant. His Third and Sixth Columns, after repeated attacks by the National Army, are still fleeing in the mountainous areas near Luoshan, Jingfu, Macheng, and Yingshan. The Second Column also appears to be fleeing north again from Xixian via Wunengji. The First Column is still in the area south of Renqiu. In order to clean up this remnant, the National Army is stepping up its suppression separately. The bandits in the mountainous area are weakening day by day.

Shanxi-Shaanxi: In Shanxi-Shaanxi, Peng Dehuai led the main force of his First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Columns and began to invade Yichuan on the 24th of last month. The National Army stationed there gave them a head-on blow. In one night, the bandits suffered more than 6,400 casualties. On the 29th, the bandit leader He Long led another five brigades to cross the river from western Shanxi to reinforce them. The National Army fought bravely, with one against ten, and although there were also casualties, they are still in stalemate. Peng's purpose is nothing more than to contain the National Army's eastward encirclement and suppression of Chen Geng's bandit troops, and to isolate Yan'an or flee back to Yan'an's old base, but this dream will not be easily realized.

### Impeding the Westward Expansion of Communist Forces: The U.S. Urgently Needs to Provide Aid to Turkey and Greece; Marshall Appeals to the House Foreign Affairs Committee; U.S. Lawmakers Advocate Establishing a New International Organization to Safeguard Collective Security

[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 3rd (Broadcast): Washington dispatch, Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, stating that the pressure from the Communist Party on Turkey and Greece is intensifying. If these countries are to maintain their freedom, they must receive aid from the United States. Both strongly urged Congress to approve an additional $275 million in military aid to Turkey and Greece. Marshall believes this aid can strengthen the Greek government's fight against guerrillas. Forrestal believes that aiding Turkey and Greece is a test of America's determination to resist communist aggression and said that only the U.S. can help Turkey and Greece maintain their freedom and remain among democratic nations. If we hesitate, America's leadership in rebuilding the world and the prospects for peace will suffer greatly.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Several Republican senators today submitted an amendment to the Marshall Plan to the Senate, advocating that the United States lead other nations in establishing a supreme international commission outside the United Nations to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence. The proposal was decided upon at a meeting of 14 Republicans last night to discuss amending the Marshall Plan. Although the full text does not directly mention the Soviet Union, the intention is clear. According to the proposal, the right of veto cannot be used in the future new world organization, and its main task is to prevent "aggression or sabotage in any form." According to Senator Brewster, who participated in last night's meeting, the new organization is a "defensive alliance" that will provide "effective collective security" without being undermined by the veto power.

[United Press International, Washington, 3rd] Republican senators criticized the government's export policy, accusing the government of shipping rare materials needed for the European Recovery Program to the Soviet Union. Senators Knowland and Vandenberg demanded that the government explain why it was sending industrial materials to the Soviet Union while simultaneously requesting billions of dollars from Congress to prevent communism in Europe. Acting Secretary of Commerce Foster denied in a letter to Knowland that rare materials were being shipped to the Soviet Union. He stated that the total value of goods shipped to the Soviet Union in 1947 reached $149,129,000, including only trains, vehicles, electrical machinery, electric machine tools, mining machines, etc., and there were absolutely no items that directly assisted the war effort.

### Discussing the Western European Union Plan: Five Countries Meet in Brussels; British Parliamentary Delegation Visits Paris

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] The Anglo-French Friendship Group, representing British and French parliamentarians, issued a communique today expressing the hope that the Western European Union could be established as soon as possible. Eden, the leader of the British parliamentary delegation and former Conservative Foreign Secretary, said in a speech at the group's meeting this morning that if Britain and France cannot understand each other, it would be truly disheartening for world peace. The British delegation and French parliamentarians attended a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Bidault this afternoon.

### Arrested Turkish Communists Undergo Secret Trial

[United Press, Istanbul, 2nd] Fifty-six communists accused of organizing groups and engaging in class struggle are undergoing secret trial today. This is the last group arrested in the anti-communist campaign in December 1946. At that time, hundreds of people were arrested, political parties and trade unions were dissolved, and four publishing houses were shut down. The defendants' protest against the secret trial was ineffective. According to the prosecutor, the public has become indignant towards the Communist Party, and for safety reasons, a secret trial is absolutely necessary.

### Soviet and Hungarian Legations Upgraded

### Soviet Atomic Weapons Achievable in Seven Years

### Anglo-Italian Friendship Treaty:

British Government Making Final Touches

### According to Trade Agreement, Britain Can Supply Weapons to the Soviet Union

[United Press International, London, 3rd] Robertson told the House of Commons that Britain might ship war weapons to the Soviet Union under the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement.

### The Soviet Union Agrees to Direct Consultation Among the Five Powers to Resolve the Holy Land Partition Plan; Britain Declares Refusal to Participate in Cooperation

[United Press, Lake Success, 2nd] Soviet representative Gromyko stated at the United Nations Security Council today that he conditionally accepted the American suggestion that the five major powers jointly find a way to resolve the Palestine problem. Gromyko declared that the Soviet Union opposes the formal establishment of a five-power committee to consult with the Arab, Jewish, and British parties. This matter must be consulted by the five major powers themselves. Setting up another committee would only delay the solution, and no major power should hide behind the committee. The American proposal to establish a five-power committee to consult with the parties involved is far-fetched and cannot be considered proper. There is already a Palestine committee consulting with the Jewish and Arab parties, and there is no need to add redundant institutions. After holding informal meetings, the five major powers should report to the Security Council within ten or fifteen days. The situation is urgent and cannot be delayed any longer. In addition, Gromyko has not yet expressed his attitude regarding the Palestine Committee's request to send international troops to assist in the implementation of the Holy Land partition, and representatives of other countries have also delayed speaking on this point. Earlier, American representative Austin spoke, urging the adoption of his proposal made a week ago and saying that the United States supports the Palestine partition plan passed by the United Nations General Assembly, but it must be implemented peacefully. As Austin was about to finish his speech and asked the Security Council to take action, a woman in the public gallery suddenly shouted, "What kind of action?" Guards immediately stopped the woman from shouting, but the woman continued to mutter. The guards then dragged her out of the venue. While resisting, the woman shouted, "Don't Americans have the right to speak?" Other guards gathered and finally carried her out.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 3rd] British Colonial Secretary Jones told the Security Council yesterday that Britain would refuse to participate in the five-power committee proposed by the United States to find a way to resolve the deadlock in the United Nations' implementation of the partition plan. He also stated that the British military presence in Palestine will not be extended beyond August 1.

### United Nations Personnel Arrive in Jerusalem

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 3rd] Six staff members of the Secretariat of the United Nations Palestine Committee arrived in Jerusalem today.

### Carelessness at a Chinese School in the Philippines

[United Press, Manila, 11th] Two fires occurred in the Philippines today. One was in Baguio Town, leaving 1,000 residents homeless. One was at a Chinese school in Manila, leaving 1,000 students out of school.

### Boehner Elected Prime Minister of British-American Zone in Germany

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 2nd] The Economic Council of the British-American zone today elected Boehner as chairman with 40 votes against 8, and 48 abstentions. Communist members protested that Boehner had not obtained a majority of the attending members and proposed a "vote of no confidence." However, since a vote of no confidence can only be proposed after the Land Council of the merged zone and the British-American control authorities approve the chairman's appointment, the Communist members' attempt to oppose was temporarily unsuccessful. The chairman of the Economic Council is equivalent to the "Prime Minister" of the merged zone. In addition, Erhard of the Christian Social Union party in Bavaria was elected as the Minister of Economic Affairs of the Economic Council, and others elected were Minister of Food, Agriculture, and Forestry Huhnigen, Minister of Finance Hartmann, Minister of Transportation Fromme, and Minister of Post and Telecommunications Huber. Observers expect the new "Prime Minister" to gain the support of the Liberal Party and the Christian Democratic Party, but will face opposition from the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

### Finland at a Crossroads: President Inquires of Stalin with Seven Questions; All Political Parties Agree to Tentative Negotiations with the Soviet Union

[United Press, Helsinki, 3rd] It is now confirmed that President Paasikivi is becoming impatient with the Parliament's delay in expressing its opinion on the issue of the Soviet Union's request for a treaty. Although the leaders of all parties agree to conduct treaty negotiations, they emphasize that they do not have to accept Stalin's proposal as a result. Based on his many years of experience in dealing with the Soviet Union, Paasikivi fears that the parliament's delay will anger the Soviet Union and undermine the basis for favorable negotiations. The chairman of the party group declared that [they] have no intention of using delaying tactics, but the issue is very serious and must be carefully considered.

[Reuters, Helsinki, 2nd] It was announced here today that Finnish President Paasikivi has raised seven questions to Stalin regarding the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a military mutual assistance treaty with Finland. These include: (1) What obligations will the treaty stipulate for the Finnish army, which has already been greatly reduced due to the peace treaty? (2) What impact will the treaty have on public opinion? (3) Will the treaty improve or harm relations between the two countries? (4) What impact will the treaty have on the peace treaty? (5) What is the meaning of certain provisions in the Romanian and Bulgarian treaties? Stalin had specifically mentioned the Romanian and Bulgarian treaties as models for a mutual assistance treaty with Finland. These questions have been included in a letter that the Finnish president entrusted to Soviet envoy Savonenkov last Saturday to be forwarded to Stalin. Government experts have already prepared a report after studying the issue, but the parties, except for the far-left party that supports the Soviet-Finnish treaty, are still studying it. All party leaders except the leader of the People's Democratic League say that Finland does not welcome the conclusion of a military mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union, but cannot refuse to discuss it. While these leaders advocate maintaining good relations with the Soviet Union, they also believe that Finland should ideally take a neutral stance. They also advocate that whether or not to conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union should be decided by the Parliament. It is said that President Paasikivi also agrees that the decision should be made by the Parliament rather than the United Cabinet. The People's Democratic League occupies a very important position in the cabinet.

[United Press, Helsinki, 2nd] The parliamentarians of the Social Democratic Party, one of Finland's three major parties, met tonight to discuss the Soviet Union's request for Finland to conclude a mutual assistance and friendship treaty and issued a statement requesting that this issue be handled in accordance with constitutional and democratic methods, and denouncing the Communist Party's attempt to provoke and create domestic conflict and discord among the classes by using the past situation. Earlier, the Communist Party had begun to propagate support for the Soviet Union's request. The People's Democratic League controlled by the Communist Party occupies 51 of the 200 seats in the parliament and is the largest party in the country. Other government groups such as the Social Democratic Party and the Farmers' Party each occupy 48 seats.

However, the "People's Front" and the extreme left wing of the Social Democratic Party also issued a statement late at night, urging acceptance of the military treaty and praising the Soviet Union as "the most powerful country on our continent." The leaders of the six major parties each held meetings, warning party members that Finland had little choice but to begin negotiations on a military treaty. However, the party leaders reiterated that accepting negotiations does not mean accepting the treaty.

### Italian Deputy Foreign Minister's Important Documents Stolen Due to Momentary Negligence

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 3rd] A briefcase containing important official documents belonging to Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Brusca was stolen on the 3rd. The briefcase was lost on his car due to a momentary negligence, and then stolen when the driver left the car unattended.

To Study Ways to Mediate International Disputes

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 2nd] The United Nations Small General Assembly today unanimously passed the joint Sino-American proposal to establish a fifteen-nation ad hoc committee to study ways to enhance international cooperation to maintain peace in accordance with the United Nations Charter. This joint proposal has a far-reaching impact on the future of the United Nations. The ad hoc committee will study various proposals, the main purpose of which is to seek solutions to international disputes by conciliation and mediation mechanisms before they are submitted to the Security Council and the General Assembly. If this goal is successful, the United Nations can avoid certain political disputes. The ad hoc committee is composed of fifteen countries, including Britain, the United States, China, France, Belgium, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Greece, Iran, Lebanon, Sweden, and Venezuela. Its research results will be submitted to the Small General Assembly in a preliminary report within three weeks.

### British Government to Use Remaining $100 Million of U.S. Loan Soon

[United Press, London, 2nd] A responsible person said today that the last remaining $100 million of the U.S. loan to Britain may be used within two or three days. The Ministry of Finance neither confirmed nor denied this. Of the $3.75 billion in U.S. loans, $400 million remained unused by August 20 last year, which was once frozen and then unfrozen, with $100 million being withdrawn monthly.

### Czechoslovakia Implements Strict Purge: Hundreds of Thousands Unemployed or Demoted; Beneš's Heartbreak and Suicide Rumors Unconfirmed

[Reuters, Prague, 2nd] Unofficial estimates put the number of people unemployed or demoted in the Czech purge at hundreds of thousands. In one iron factory in Moravia, 1,100 workers were dismissed simply because they refused to sign a declaration of loyalty to the new government.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Hamburg Radio reported that according to a spokesman for the Czech Ministry of Information, President Beneš suddenly fell ill at a villa outside Prague and is being treated by his personal physician. It is uncertain when he will return to office.

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] Rumors are rampant here that Czech President Beneš has committed suicide. French officials refused to comment on this. The Czech Embassy in Paris has officially denied the rumor. However, authoritative French sources assert that Beneš attempted suicide unsuccessfully but has become seriously ill as a result. It is said that Beneš committed suicide by taking poison at a villa outside Prague. The report did not disclose other details, but only hinted that the Action Committee's guards discovered it and prevented the poison from taking full effect. Earlier, it was rumored in London and Paris that Beneš had resigned, but the Czech Embassy in London quickly denied the rumor.

[United Press International, Prague, 2nd] Czech President Beneš, who had dedicated 34 years of his life to fighting for the independence of his country, having been exiled twice, is reportedly considering one of three strategies to protest the Communist seizure of power. A senior official in close contact with Beneš said, "The President is currently considering the following three strategies: (1) Resigning and leaving the country. This move is quite risky, as he is old and may not be able to withstand it, and a third exile is not something he would willingly do. He knows that there are successors coveting his position, and they could launch a propaganda war at any time, tarnishing his reputation. (2) Resigning but remaining in the country. (3) Continuing to serve until the end of his term in 1953 and continuing to perform his duties. He only accepted the new regime under pressure and in violation of his ideas of constitutional representative procedures, so Beneš will not openly support it." The official said that Beneš is seriously considering the third strategy, "Continuing to serve may be a spiritual boost for the Czech people."

### Czech Ambassador to the U.S. and Canadian Minister Have Resigned Voluntarily

[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 3rd (Broadcast): Washington dispatch, Czech Ambassador to the United States Slavík has recently resigned to protest the recent coup d'état launched by the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia.

Hidden Pains Before the Birth of a World Organization

On August 28, 1944, during the second week of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, the Soviet representative, Gromyko, suddenly introduced a new and surprising proposal in the discussions.

The discussions in the Steering Committee of the conference were focused on which countries should be the original members of the United Nations organization. Both the Soviet Union and we believed that member states should be the United Nations and associated nations. However, a fundamental difference arose in the interpretation of this matter.

Our intention was that the member states should be all countries that had signed the United Nations Declaration, plus eight countries that, although not at war with the Axis powers, had materially helped the Allied nations during the war. In fact, their contributions were even greater than some of the Allied countries themselves. These eight countries were six Latin American nations, plus Iceland and Egypt. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, stated that the member states should be the original twenty-six countries that had signed the United Nations Declaration, and their interpretation of "associated nations" referred only to countries that signed the Declaration later. They were unwilling to include the eight countries we had mentioned. Regarding the latter point, our discussions were fruitless. In fact, it remained unresolved by the end of the conference. At the same time, Ambassador Gromyko, without any prior notice, suddenly proposed to the Steering Committee that all sixteen republics that made up the Soviet Union should be original members of the United Nations organization. Thus, the Soviet Union would have sixteen votes. This proposal stunned Stettinius and Cadogan (head of the British delegation) and they did not know how to respond. But they immediately told him that his proposal would cause great difficulties. When Stettinius reported the matter to the President, the President firmly stated that the United States could not accept this proposal under any circumstances. He told Stettinius to explain to Gromyko that this matter would cause endless trouble, and if it were agreed to allow the sixteen states comprising the Soviet Union to join, then we could just as logically demand that the forty-eight states of the American Union join individually.

When Stettinius reported this matter to me, I said that I was extremely surprised by this proposal. I also said that none of us Americans involved in postwar planning had ever considered this issue. I concluded that I would oppose it with all my strength.

On August 29, Stettinius informed Gromyko of the results of his conversations with the President and me, saying that we considered this proposal to be outside the agenda, and if it was insisted upon at this time, it would hinder the success of the conference. Stettinius asked Gromyko to withdraw the proposal, and said that if the Soviet government had such an intention, it would be more appropriate to raise it in the Security Council after the United Nations organization was established.

Gromyko was very cooperative. He said that his raising this point was merely to inform us and the British that his government had such an idea in mind. He agreed not to mention the matter again during the conference. However, he hinted that the Soviet government might raise this issue again at other times.

The fact that the Soviet government had such an idea about multiple member states was quite troubling. I then asked Ambassador Gromyko to see me on August 31. During the meeting, I frankly told him the reasons for my opposition to the issue raised by him on behalf of his government. I told him that his proposal would "blow everything up." I said that since the major powers would occupy a leading position in the organization and contribute military force, they would have no difficulty in making their views known to other countries, whether they had one vote or many votes. The United States did not want more than one vote, but we felt that, due to our strength, we would be able to express our opinions clearly at any time.

On the same day, we prepared a telegram at the State Department for the President to send to Stalin on this matter. The President approved it, but added a sentence saying that our position did not affect future discussions on this issue after the establishment of the United Nations organization, at which time the organization would have full authority to deal with the matter. This issue of the Soviet Union wanting multiple votes was mentioned once more by Gromyko near the end of the conference. Afterwards, until my resignation in November 1944, I never heard it mentioned again. The Soviet representatives also never mentioned to me their later request to allow Belarus and Ukraine to join, which President Roosevelt agreed to at the Yalta Conference. If they had raised it with me earlier, I would definitely have opposed it.

Throughout all discussions at the conference, we strove to keep this proposal strictly secret. Even in our own memoranda, we only referred to it as "something." I felt that this matter was so explosive that if it were leaked, it would definitely be exploited by opposing forces everywhere to undermine the position of the Soviet Union and the entire conference.

On September 6, Stettinius and I met with the President at the White House to discuss the major issues under discussion at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. President Roosevelt first mentioned the location of the new organization's headquarters. He believed that the various institutions of the organization should hold meetings around the world.

He felt that the secretariat of the new organization could be located in Geneva, but that the meetings of the General Assembly and the Security Council should not be held there. He believed that the General Assembly should hold meetings in a different location each year, and that the Security Council would need two fixed meeting locations, one in the Azores in the mid-Atlantic and one on an island in the Hawaiian Islands in the mid-Pacific. He felt that the International Court of Justice should return to The Hague.

The President was very serious when expressing these views, and he also said that he was prepared to discuss the matter with Prime Minister Churchill when he went to Quebec for the Second Quebec Conference later that month. The State Department prepared maps and memoranda regarding the Azores and the island of Niihau in Hawaii, and the President planned to take them to Quebec.

President Roosevelt had put a lot of thought into the issue of the United Nations headquarters, and this was not the first time he had told me about his views on this matter. He felt that putting the Security Council in the Azores or the Hawaiian Islands would have the benefit of keeping it at a distance from the world. The President was by nature a naval person, and he liked to look at the world from isolated islands in the sea. In the late 1930s, he had tried hard to hold a meeting of the heads of state on warships or on islands, such as the Azores. He felt that if the Security Council was far out at sea, it would not be subject to pressure from any country. He recalled the Paris Peace Conference, and the pressure that resulted from holding the conference in the capital of a major power. He felt that the League of Nations had been subject to pressure when it was located in London before moving to Geneva.

He said that in nature, he hoped to establish something like an international District of Columbia. (I often found that when the President described his views on international issues, he liked to use the situation in the United States itself as a comparison. The most obvious example was in his speeches in 1940 and 1941, when he compared the ease with which Axis planes could fly from Dakar to Brazil to the ease with which they could fly from one city to another in the United States.)

However, scattering an international organization in different locations around the world was not a very logical thing to do, so we never seriously insisted on these ideas at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. In any case, this was not a matter that the four powers could decide, but rather one that should be decided by all the member states of the future organization.

We also discussed with the President the Soviet proposal to establish an international air force under the United Nations organization, to be commanded by the Security Council. Stettinius and I explained the position of the American delegation, saying that we should oppose the establishment of an international air force, and instead propose that each country form its own air force squadron, which could be deployed to mixed airfields upon notification to carry out missions. This proposal was consistent with the President's statement on June 15 that he did not intend to establish an international police force. The President agreed that we should insist on this position. Stettinius told the President that Prime Minister Churchill might mention this issue to him in Quebec, because we had heard that Prime Minister Churchill seemed to be quite impressed with the Soviet proposal.

We also discussed another Soviet proposal, namely that small countries that could not contribute air force to the security organization should contribute land as bases. The President and I both strongly opposed this provision, as it infringed on the sovereignty of small countries. We felt that such actions should be entirely voluntary, and small countries should not be forced to contribute bases. However, the Soviet view was given considerable recognition in the Dumbarton Oaks Conference proposals, which advocated special agreements providing "facilities," armed forces, and other assistance to be at the disposal of the Security Council.

At that time, when we mentioned this new international organization, we often referred to it as the "United Nations." We had been using this name in some of our drafts for some time. The President believed that this should be the name of the new organization, and we also felt that it was a lucky name that more than forty countries had fought together under and won victory, and that they could continue to cooperate under it after their victory. But when Stettinius raised this proposal at the conference, we encountered unexpected opposition from the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. Gromyko tentatively suggested the name "World Alliance." Cadogan said that he did not believe that the British government would particularly like the name "United Nations," and had thought of suggesting a name that included the word "alliance." (Note: A few days later, both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom accepted the name "United Nations.")

### U.S. Representative to South Korea Criticizes North Korea's Communization

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 3rd] The U.S. State Department representative to South Korea issued a statement to Korean patriots yesterday, stating first, "The United States made the greatest sacrifices in the war against Japan, while the Soviet Union only joined the war against Japan before Japan's surrender." The meaning implied is that it is unfair to divide Korea along the 38th parallel for occupation. It continued, "The blockade of the 38th parallel hinders the free development of Korea. The United Nations has resolved to work towards abolishing the blockade of the 38th parallel." The statement also loudly appealed to awaken Korean patriots and not be poisoned by communist propaganda. It stated, "Due to the orders of the communist supreme command, North Korea has been communized and is proceeding to communize South Korea. The recent riots and malicious propaganda in South Korea were caused by this order." Finally, the U.S. representative urged the people of North Korea to listen to South Korean broadcasts from the U.S. side in order to convey opinions at any time.

### Real Power of Katayama Cabinet Still Controlled by Socialist Party

Allocation of Cabinet Posts among Three Parties Largely Decided

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The work of forming a cabinet by the Japan Democratic Party has now progressed to the stage of negotiations for cabinet members. It is generally believed that the final decision will not be made until the 5th. Today, Democratic Party President Ashida visited Katayama and Miki separately, formally requesting the Socialist and Cooperative parties to submit their lists of cabinet nominees. It is understood that the allocation of cabinet seats has been largely decided, with the ratio being 7 for the Democrats (including the Prime Minister), 8 for the Socialists, and 2 for the Cooperatives. The Democratic Party will receive the portfolios of Finance, Transportation, Communications, and three Ministers without Portfolio. The Socialist Party will receive the portfolios of Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, Commerce and Industry, Labor, Education, and three Ministers without Portfolio. The Cooperative Party will receive the portfolios of Health and Welfare and one Minister without Portfolio. For other important positions held concurrently by Ministers without Portfolio, the Democratic Party will receive the positions of Chief Cabinet Secretary and President of the Construction Agency, and the Socialist Party will receive the positions of Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board and President of the Legal Affairs Agency. Given this allocation and ratio, the real power of the Ashida Cabinet remains in the hands of the Socialist Party.

### Allied Council for Japan: U.S. and Soviet Union Trade Accusations

U.S. Representative: Soviet Union Discusses Internal Affairs

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The United States on the 3rd accused the Soviet Union of interfering in the organization of the Japanese government. At the same time, the Soviet Union demanded that Ashida, the new Prime Minister who was elected with U.S. consent, be purged and barred from political activity. The mutual accusations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union occurred during a meeting of the Allied Council for Japan, with the representatives of China and the United States supporting the U.S. accusation against the Soviet Union. Soviet representative Major General Kislenko read an eight-page document at the meeting, stating that Japan's economic crisis was deepening, and that the occupying forces immediately refused to organize a government representing the majority of the people. He claimed that the Shidehara, Yoshida, and Katayama cabinets were all incapable of rescuing the economic crisis. Kislenko also claimed that many people in the previous cabinets should have been purged, but they remained in office. He then read a series of names, including Ashida. At this point, the chairman of the meeting, U.S. representative Sebald, stopped Kislenko from continuing to read and retorted, asking what right the Soviet representative had to interfere in the organization of the Japanese cabinet. Sebald stated that the Allied Council had no authority to discuss Japanese political figures. Sebald stated that occupation policy stipulated that the new democratic government of Japan should be produced by the free will of the people. He further stated that discussing Japanese political figures at this time would affect the free choice in organizing the cabinet. Kislenko accused Sebald of depriving him of his right to express opinions on occupation matters. Sebald replied that if the Soviet Union wished to raise the matter, there was a special Preparatory Committee for that, but Kislenko declared that he refused to contact any organization other than the Allied Council. Sebald also stated that MacArthur approved Ashida's appointment as Prime Minister based on democratic procedures.

### Public Buses Briefly Suspended; Cook Causes Injury to Ticket Inspector; Garrison Command Handles Impartially; Three People Detained That Night, Resolved Satisfactorily

[Reported by this newspaper] The No. 4 public bus running between the Bund and Changyang Road was suspended yesterday at around 5 p.m. because of a conflict on Dalian Road between ticket inspector No. 45 and a cook from the Garrison Command Headquarters. The ticket inspector was beaten and injured, causing all buses on the route to be suspended. At the same time, the No. 7 and No. 11 buses also responded, and the situation became quite serious for a time. Later, the Garrison Commander organized a military trial that night, which was resolved satisfactorily only at 1:30 a.m. this morning.

The cause of the incident was that a cook named Xie Daisheng from the Garrison Command Headquarters boarded the No. 358 bus of the No. 4 route on Xuchang Road at 5:10 p.m. yesterday without a ticket. When he got off at the intersection of Dalian Road and Huade Road, he encountered ticket inspector No. 45, Zou Liren. Zou found that he had no ticket and, because he was only wearing a gray military uniform, asked him if he had any identification. Xie showed him an old identification from 1947. Zou said it had expired and was no longer valid, and a dispute ensued. Zou then borrowed a telephone from the nearby Dalian Motor Company and attempted to call the company to request instructions on how to handle the situation. At this time, Xie had invited five or six people to reason with him. At that time, a disagreement arose and the argument escalated into a fight. Although police officer No. 1386 attempted to mediate, his efforts were ineffective. Zou Liren was ultimately outnumbered and beaten to the ground, and then taken to the Garrison Command Headquarters. At this time, Garrison Command Deputy Commander, Army Major General Mei Zhanyi, had already heard the news and was furious. In addition to detaining Xie, he expressed his apologies to the injured ticket inspector on the spot and stated that he was willing to bear all medical expenses and other compensation. At this time, all the employees of the No. 4, No. 7, and No. 11 public bus routes had gone on strike and made three demands: (1) that the Garrison Command punish the offending soldiers, (2) that they be responsible for all medical expenses of the injured person, and (3) that they apologize and guarantee that the same incident would not happen again in the future.

The Garrison Command Headquarters immediately organized a temporary military court at the China Restaurant on Daying Road, the location of the incident. The trial was conducted by Deputy Commander Mei Zhanyi, Chief of Staff Gao Baoshu, and Military Judges Lu Zhengqiang and Mao Yanli. First, Zou Liren was summoned for questioning, but because he was injured and his voice was low, Vice Director of the Transportation Group Ding Weitang relayed the course of events on his behalf. After questioning police officer No. 1386, the perpetrator Xie Daisheng was brought in for questioning. Xie was tied up and interrogated in turn by the officers. Xie confessed that Zhong Shiyang and Wang Chaode had also participated in the beating. The interrogation ended at 1:00 a.m. this morning. Xie, Zhong Shiyang, and Wang Chaode were immediately taken into custody. The injured person was sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment, and it was reported that his injuries were not serious.

All three demands made by the public bus company were fully accepted by Garrison Command Deputy Commander Mei, and the dispute was thus resolved satisfactorily.

### Ren Xianqun Discusses Rice Rationing Prices: Cannot Be Too Low to Prevent Backflow; Ration Certificates Must Be Issued by the 5th

[Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of comprehensive rice rationing in this city in March, the rice rationing certificates have been issued in two periods, the upper and lower halves of the month, due to the rice source problem. The rice rationing certificates for the first half of the month were originally limited to being issued before the 3rd. However, due to the slow procedures of the Bao-Tian offices in various districts, some people have not yet received them, which has greatly affected the rice rationing work. Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee, is scheduled to host a banquet for the district heads of the 30 districts of the city at 6 p.m. today at the China Merchants Bureau on the sixth floor, requesting them to urge the Bao-Jia personnel in the districts to speed up their work and ensure that the rice rationing certificates are issued to the citizens by the 5th. The rice rationing certificates for the second half of the month are also being processed and printed and are scheduled to be issued to the citizens from the 6th to the 8th. In order to strengthen the supervision work, the Allocation Committee will set up one on-site supervisor in each district to supervise on the spot. In addition, there will be several roving supervisors rotating to various districts to monitor, in order to prevent malpractices and strengthen work efficiency. The organization of the Distribution Office of the Committee has been decided as follows: Director, Zhou Yi'e; Deputy Directors, Ji Mingzhai and Gao Junliang. It is divided into five sections: retail store management, certificate issuance, design, warehouse management, and supervision.

Policy Has Been Effective

Recently, there has been much criticism from the outside world regarding the price of rationed rice at 2.4 million yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), as it is not much different from the market price. Our reporter made a special visit to Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee. According to the discussion, the initial significance of rice rationing is to stabilize the economic foundation, extend the cycle of fluctuations, and recover legal tender to reduce the amount of issuance. Therefore, the price of rationed rice must meet the market price, with a maximum limit of no less than 5% of the market price. The American relief supplies are national in scope and not limited to the five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin (Tianjin), and Guangzhou. The income from rice rationing in the five cities is now used as a national relief fund to promote the initial stabilization of China's economy and then to start reforming the currency system. According to statistics, in 1947, the average monthly rice supply to each citizen in the Shanghai rice market was only six sheng (unit of dry measure) and one he (tenth of a sheng) and two ge (tenth of a he), but the average monthly consumption of each citizen was one dou (ten sheng) and five sheng. Two-thirds of the consumption did not pass through the market and went directly to the consumers.

Worries About Low Grain Prices Harming Farmers

The current government supplies 500,000 dan (unit of dry measure) of rationed rice to Shanghai every month. In addition to foreigners eating bread and northerners eating flour, this accounts for about two-thirds of the monthly rice needs of Shanghai, which already has a decisive force. In this way, even if the price of the other one-third of the rice source fluctuates, there is no fear of it rising to any degree. Looking at the small return of rice prices in the past three days, the rice rationing policy has been effective. Shanghai is a rice consumption area and cannot allow the rice price to be lower than that of the production area; otherwise, it will create a backflow phenomenon with serious consequences. Currently, there are two points that we should study: (1) To prevent the rice price from leading to the rise of other commodity prices, and to reasonably adjust the rice price under this principle. (2) The rice price cannot be too low to encourage merchants to purchase and transport it. It is also necessary to take into account the harm to farmers from low grain prices. If farmers give up production because the harvest from rice cultivation does not cover the cost, the consequences would be worrying. At present, rice prices in various places in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are mostly higher than in this city. If the fixed rationing price of 2.4 million yuan is reduced, the power to control the market will be reduced, the policy will be detached, and a backflow phenomenon will be formed. Therefore, it is impossible to reduce the price of rationed rice. According to Chairman Ren, the rice rationing in this city in March can generate a total income of 1.2 trillion yuan.

### The 9th Gendarmerie Regiment Arrives in Shanghai; The City's Defenses are Further Consolidated

The 9th Gendarmerie Regiment was ordered to be stationed in Shanghai and arrived in Shanghai by train from Wuxi on the 3rd. It is reported that the defense of the area north of the Suzhou River in this city will be the responsibility of the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Regiment, and the defense south of the Suzhou River will remain the responsibility of the Independent 3rd Battalion. The Independent 3rd Battalion is under the unified command of the 9th Regiment. The defense of this city is therefore further consolidated. The 9th Regiment is also responsible for the security of the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway lines. The defense of various places along the Beijing-Shanghai line has been changed to be the responsibility of the 1st Gendarmerie Regiment, but the escort service on the Beijing-Shanghai line will still be undertaken by the 9th Regiment.

The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Committee for All Circles to Receive and Comfort Soldiers Going on Expeditions, the Shanghai Garrison District, the Shanghai Regiment Garrison District, the Air Force Supply Headquarters, the Wusong Fortress Headquarters, the Military School Graduates Investigation Office, the Military Service Association, the Friends of the Military Society, and other agencies and groups, in order to welcome the new Port Commander Zhou Lixing, Navy Base Commander Dong Muchen, and Commander Luo of the 9th Gendarmerie Regiment, yesterday held a preparatory meeting. Xie Renzhao presided over the meeting and decided to hold a tea party to welcome them at the Friends of the Military Society at 2 p.m. on the 5th. Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Xuan Tiewu, Chuan Zhengmo, Shao Baichang, Xie Renzhao, and Wang Weimin were elected as the presidium.

### The City Council Approves the Appropriation of Electricity Fines for the Establishment of the City Garrison Brigade; The Council Fails to Adjourn as Scheduled Today

[Our Newspaper] The City Council held its seventh meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss proposals related to military service, police affairs, education, etc. According to the agenda, the fifth general assembly of the council will be the last day (the tenth day) today, but because there are still many proposals waiting to be resolved, it has failed to adjourn as scheduled today. The date of the extension will be decided by the general assembly today.

There are three proposals concerning military service issues and the establishment of local armed forces, which were all hotly debated by the general assembly separately: (1) The mayor submitted a proposal "to transfer 100 billion yuan of the city's electricity over-limit fines for the establishment of the city garrison brigade, please submit it to the general assembly for discussion", which was approved. (2) The speaker submitted a proposal "to approve the government's letter to the Ministry of National Defense regarding whether the conscription in this city in 1948 should adopt the lottery method or the voluntary method, and to forward the letter to solicit opinions", and it was resolved that the conscription method in this city in 1948 should be supplemented by regular conscription and the voluntary system. (3) "In order to strengthen the local armed forces in this city, establish a self-defense force as soon as possible in accordance with the law, and incorporate all the volunteer inspectors and volunteer police in this city, and allow the personnel joining the team to be granted deferred service, and the conscripted personnel in this city shall be compiled into the standing members of the self-defense force to consolidate public security and stabilize the local area", and it was resolved that the local armed forces should be the self-defense force and volunteer police as the first level, and the garrison brigade as the second level.

Police Affairs

There are a total of seven proposals: (1) It is proposed that the police bureau issue a notice to its subordinates to take into account the difficulties of merchants and not lightly give business shops the punishment of suspension of business. Resolution: 1. Those who have applied for registration but have not received a license should be allowed to rely on the application receipt as proof, except in special circumstances, and should be given a grace period from being banned. 2. Those who have not applied for registration and obtained a license but have already opened for business may be given a limited time to complete the application procedures and should not be suspended from business. (2) Please request military vehicles to hang license plates in accordance with regulations when moving in the streets and to drive slowly in busy streets. Resolution: Send a letter to the municipal government to forward to the garrison headquarters and the Ministry of National Defense to strictly order their subordinates to comply. (3) It is proposed that the municipal government forward a letter to the naval authorities to order the eight old warships anchored in the center of the river at Longhua Mouth on the South Huangpu River to be required to light marker lights at night to avoid the recurrence of the tragedy of capsizing and drowning. Resolution: Handle it in accordance with the original method and send a letter to the municipal government to forward a letter to the garrison headquarters to order compliance. (4) Residents Guo Xiliang and others, because their relatives Guo Fumin were innocently killed in the conflict between the Gindu police and the police, requested that the municipal government be given preferential treatment. Resolution: Please forward a letter from this council to the municipal government to promptly allocate compensation to the citizens who were innocently injured and killed in the Gindu case. (5) Whether the Shanghai Volunteer Inspection Brigade or the Action Brigade should be abolished, it is proposed that the municipal government forward a letter to the garrison headquarters for consideration. Resolution: Passed in accordance with the original proposal. (6) Ban the arbitrary high-speed navigation of ships and boats in the Huangpu River to ensure the safety of general ships navigating upstream and downstream. Resolution: Passed in accordance with the original proposal. (7) Improve traffic control. Method: Divide the road sections, unify the command within the same road section, all north-south directions when north-south, all east-west directions when east-west, so that the waiting time is reduced, and the traffic volume of vehicles is naturally increased. Resolution: This case is sent to the police and public works bureaus for reference.

Education

There are eight proposals from the bureau: among them, (1) It is requested that the Education Bureau increase the number of classes in each national school in the urban area by at least 200 classes to accommodate out-of-school children, which was discussed more enthusiastically. The resolution passed one by one: (1) Please increase the number of classes in national schools by at least 200 classes from this semester. If there are difficulties due to school buildings, please ask the Education Bureau to add schools. (2) The regular and temporary expenses of the 200 classes should be included in the budget of this year by the municipal government. Finally, Senator Li Wenjie made a temporary motion requesting the Director of the Education Bureau to list the current number of classes, the number of people, and the financial situation of the national education classes in detail for the council's reference. (2) Restrict tuition fees in various schools, take into account the general affordability, and aim to popularize education. Resolution: The municipal government has set standards for the tuition fee issue for this semester, and a letter is sent to the municipal government to strictly implement it in accordance with the prescribed standards. (3) It is proposed that the municipal government forward an order to the Education Bureau to investigate the management of private primary and secondary schools in this city in detail, to determine the level of good or bad, and to stipulate the base number of fees for each level of school, so as to avoid the difficulty of adjusting tuition fees every semester, and to enable both schools and parents to have a criterion to follow, so that they can mutually cease disputes and receive benefits. There are a total of eight points in this proposal, and the senators discussed it for a long time, but as a result, the general assembly voted on two opinions, and the number of votes did not exceed the legal number, so it was resolved to retain it. (4) Please ask the municipal government to formulate a five-year plan for national schools, to build the schools in the suburbs in stages, so that the school buildings of each school can be gradually built completely, whether it is appropriate, please public decision. Resolution: Please ask the Education Bureau to handle it earnestly. (5) Relief for out-of-school and unemployed youth, so as to avoid going astray and harming the country and society. Regarding those who are out of school, the methods are: (1) Increase the number of free places in various public and private schools.

### Ye Qiuyuan's Funeral Today; Memorial Service to be Held on Selected Date; Funeral Committee Decides to Hold Funeral and Burial a Week Later

[Our Newspaper] The funeral of the late legislator and chief writer of this newspaper, Mr. Ye Qiuyuan, will be held at the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 1 p.m. today, and a public memorial service will be held at 1:30 p.m., presided over by Speaker Pan Gongzhan. Friends of Mr. Ye during his lifetime decided to establish a funeral committee, which held its first preparatory meeting yesterday to discuss everything, and invited friends of Mr. Ye during his lifetime to be members of the funeral committee.

No Obituary Will Be Issued; A Public Announcement Will Be Used Instead

It was also decided at the meeting that the funeral will be held later, the tomb has been set at Hongqiao Cemetery, and a memorial service will be held on a selected date. At that time, no obituary will be issued, and a public announcement will be used instead, which will be sent to relatives and friends in the name of the funeral committee. Regarding the funeral, in accordance with Mr. Ye's lifelong frugal wishes, everything will be simplified. Therefore, the funeral committee will ask all parties not to send flower wreaths and elegiac scrolls, but to send cash to help the family members. Donations can be collected on behalf of the Shenbao newspaper. In addition, the late chief writer Ye devoted his life to writing and serving the country, and did not engage in production, so he was in poor financial condition after his death.

### Military Service Association Receives Reporters to Report and Explain Conscription Doubts

[Our Newspaper] Fang Zhi, Director of the Propaganda Committee of the Military Service Association of this city, and Feng Youzhen, Deputy Director, received the press at Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road at 3 p.m. yesterday to explain the significance of conscription. Commander Chuan Zhengmo of the Shanghai Garrison District, Commander Chen Tianqiao of the Regiment Garrison District, Secretary Lei Kenan of the Military Service Association, Section Chief Yao Wenyin of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and others were present to report on their respective duties. Before Chairman Fang delivered his speech, he asked Commander Fu to first report on the progress of military service. Mr. Chuan said: The principles and methods of conscription in this city this year have been decided at the military service meeting a few days ago. The task of the division and regiment garrison districts is to execute the orders of the Ministry of National Defense and strive to complete the conscription task as scheduled. Although there were some shortcomings in the conscription work last year, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the assistance of all parties. Since it has been decided to use lottery conscription this year, in order to avoid desertion, there must be a definite guarantor for volunteers, and those who are conscripted by lottery must have a certain amount of wealth. I hope that all sectors of society will strictly supervise the military service personnel at all levels. If there is any malpractice, it will be severely punished after verification. Chairman Fang gave a detailed analysis of the domestic and foreign regulations, and then said: The central government has decided to conscript 6,000 people in this city this year, which is not a large number. All young men who have a sense of nation and ethnicity will consciously and enthusiastically join the army. Those who commit malpractice in conscription and sabotage military service will also be sanctioned by national law. As for the settling-in allowance for new recruits, an improved method has been established this year. The living conditions and treatment of new recruits after they enter the camp will also be improved to make them feel at home when they enter the camp. Mr. Fang specifically introduced the article "The Last Stand of Americans in China" by the American journalist Uttley, and called on those who have money to donate generously and those who have the strength to join the army enthusiastically, pointing out that the current Communist banditry is no longer a simple domestic rebellion but has the support of an international background. Then, Feng Youzhen, Chen Tianqiao, Tan Yimin, Yao Wenying, and others spoke in succession.

### Yao Wenying Puts Forward Three Difficulties

Yao Wenying raised three difficulties: (1) The current military service order is suitable for rural areas and small towns, but it is difficult to conduct surveys in large cities, especially in today's Shanghai, where the population moves frequently. For example, most of the young men surveyed in June last year have already changed their addresses this year. (2) The central government stipulates that the quota of service should be allocated according to the population, but it is quite difficult to do so in practice. For example, Yangshupu District is mostly composed of workers, and many workers apply for deferred conscription and are approved, so the quota cannot be allocated according to the population. The Civil Affairs Bureau has now decided to separate the factory area and the residential area and allocate them separately. (3) When surveying young men of age last year, there were originally 1,088 Bao (unit of household administration) in this city, and 105 Bao have been added this year, so the number of people to be allocated to each Bao must be re-examined.

### Election Disputes Settled with Apologies

In the past, election disputes occurred in the North Railway Station District. The victims, Zhang Jun, Mao Pingshao, and others, sued Pan Jemei, Lu Huimin, Yang Guangming, Zhu Chunyan, Zhao Xudong, and others for obstructing the election, obstructing freedom, injury, and public danger. Subsequently, Director Fang and Jiang Yiping and Wang Liwu jointly came forward to mediate. The defendants expressed their apologies to the plaintiffs, and the grievances between the two sides were released. It is heard that the District Attorney's Office has decided not to prosecute the case.

### The Aftercare Committee of Discharged Workers from Shenxin Asks for Reinstatement

[Our Newspaper] During the labor unrest at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory, 400 workers were dismissed by the factory for allegedly inciting the labor unrest and causing trouble. After the labor unrest, the Huxi Cotton Mill Workers established an aftercare committee to be responsible for handling aftercare matters. At 3 p.m. yesterday, Zhang Guozhen, Zhu Kangyu, representatives of the dismissed workers, and Tang Guifen, Bai Jiaquan, Zhang Wenlong, representatives of the aftercare committee, visited Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and made two requests: (1) Those arrested workers who are guilty should be sentenced, and those who are innocent should be released immediately. (2) All dismissed workers should be allowed to be reinstated. Deputy Director Zhao said: (1) The arrested workers will be released after the circumstances are clarified and if they are indeed innocent. (2) If the dismissed workers are indeed wronged, they can be reinstated.

### The Social Affairs Bureau Continues to Mediate the Dismissal of the New Asia Hotel

[Our Newspaper] More than 150 dismissed workers from the New Asia Hotel are currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau due to their request for continued employment. It turned out that after the New Asia Hotel was leased to the US military advisory group last month, all the workers' personnel were obtained by Huang Zhenshan with contracting rights, and new workers were hired separately. Later, after several consultations with the old workers, the other party only agreed to hire 41 people, but it has not been fulfilled to this day, so they still ask the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate.

### The Manager of Fuxin Bookstore Was Charged and Released on Bail After Interrogation

Detective novelist Cheng Xiaoging found out that the Fuxin Bookstore in this port copied Li's old work "The Mysterious Thief" before the war and reprinted the two books "The Atomic Thief" and "The Masked Girl" under Cheng's name. He filed a criminal lawsuit through lawyer Lu Shaozong for violating the copyright law and because the content of the two books was bad, which damaged his reputation. The Criminal Court No. 2 of the District Court opened the trial yesterday. The defendant, Zhou Zhifang, the manager of Fuxin, said that he was deceived by Wang Danian. Wu Tingchang ordered the defendant to publish an apology in the newspaper for reconciliation in the civil lawsuit part. The defendant also paid a shop guarantee of 20 million yuan, and the retrial was scheduled for March 15.

### How Many Civil Servants Shed Tears of Sympathy; The Monthly Salary of Senior Appointed Personnel is Only Enough to Eat Flatbread to Make a Living; Lu Hao's Wife Passed Away After Her Husband

[Our Newspaper] After Lu Hao, an employee of the Finance Bureau, committed suicide by jumping into the river because his wife was critically ill and he could not afford medical treatment, his wife, Gu Ping, also died of illness on the morning of the 2nd. His friends and colleagues are now raising funds for him to take care of the funeral arrangements. All the employees of the Social Affairs Bureau donated a total of 21.695 million yuan, which was sent to his family yesterday. When they launched the fundraising campaign after Lu Hao's suicide, it was originally intended to save the living, but his wife eventually died, so the money was used for the funeral of Lu Hao and his wife. Faced with this tragic fact, all the employees of the Social Affairs Bureau expressed their deep grief. They believed that Lu Hao's death was enough to reflect the predicament of the more than 50,000 public employees in Shanghai, which had reached its peak. Today, a senior appointed personnel with a monthly salary of 200 yuan can get 3.995 million yuan per month, which can buy 399 and a half flatbread fritters. On average, you can get 13 sets per day. If you distribute it to a family of three, husband, wife, and children, there is no money to buy boiled water, let alone anything else. With this, how could Lu Hao survive? How could his wife not die! They all belong to civil servants and have a sense of sadness for the death of a rabbit. The fundraising campaign was particularly enthusiastic, and all the workers also helped with 5,000 to 10,000 yuan to buy fritters. They all believed that no matter how much money, even if it was just one yuan, its significance was very profound.

### The Murderer in the Female Corpse Case on Xueyuan Road in Nanshi Confessed to Murder for Money

[Our Newspaper] The case of the unidentified female corpse found on Xueyuan Road in Nanshi has now been fully revealed. Han Heshang, the suspect arrested on the 28th of last month, is the murderer Wei Fuming, also known as Wei Heshang, nicknamed Pitou Heshang. On the eve of the murder, someone witnessed the deceased leaving the Great World by rickshaw with a man and heading south. According to the murderer's confession after being arrested, it was only known that when they took the rickshaw south, they first went to the rolled noodle stall at Sanpailou to eat meat and drink alcohol together, and then went to the wooden house in Guilin Village on Guangqi Road. Taking advantage of her being drunk and asleep, he killed her with a kitchen knife. However, because the corpse was heavy and could not be moved, it was discarded on the roadside. According to the murderer's confession, the motive for the murder was mainly because the woman had a gold bracelet on her arm, so he had the evil intention of murdering for money.

### National Bank Employee Who Stole Gold Bricks Appeals for Retrial

[Report from our newspaper] Chen Yuansheng, an employee of the Custody Section of the Central Bank, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the District Court for embezzling and selling gold bricks from the vault. The case caused a great sensation at the time. Chen, dissatisfied with the verdict, has applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial, arguing that he was a temporary employee of the Central Bank's Custody Section and not a public official, making the conviction for corruption inappropriate. The Supreme Court has recently ordered the local District Court to investigate with the Central Bank whether Chen Yuansheng was indeed a temporary employee and whether the application of corruption regulations was appropriate.

### Shanghai's Public Utilities in Economic Turmoil: An Analysis of the Burden on Citizens and Possible Solutions

— Zhao Zengjue

Foreword

The intensity of China's post-war economic turmoil surpasses that of wartime. The prices of various daily necessities are soaring endlessly, causing most people to feel severely threatened. Even enjoying public utilities such as water, electricity, transportation, gas, and telephones has become an unbearable burden. Because price control cannot be solved locally by the government. We, who bear municipal responsibilities, find it very difficult to find stable strategies in this overall environment of economic turmoil and feel extremely anxious! The following suggestions are based on facts and needs and offered for the consideration of enlightened individuals within the country.

(1) The Inflation Rate of General Prices in Shanghai

Shanghai is the largest market in the country, and naturally, its economic sensitivity is more acute. Since the recovery two and a half years ago, by examining the retail price index of domestic goods in the city (the following table is based on the statistics compiled by the Municipal Government Statistics Office, using the prices from January to June of the 26th year as the base), we can clearly understand the extent of price inflation:

The above table indicates that the general price level in January of the 37th year was between 110,000 and 250,000 times higher than before the war. It is noteworthy that the later the period, the higher the rate of increase; that is, the rate of increase of various factors related to public utilities (the multiple increase compared to the 26th year) also has the same trend. Consider the following table:

(2) The Inflation Rate of Public Utility Prices in Shanghai

In such a severe situation of price fluctuations, there are two ways to maintain public utilities and seek improvement in their services: one is to calculate the cost and adjust prices, and the other is to maintain the original price and have the government provide subsidies. The city's public utilities were once subsidized from March to May of the 36th year, but because this failed to prevent price increases and the amount of subsidies grew larger and larger, the Executive Yuan announced the cancellation in June and gradually adjusted prices. The inflation rate (the multiple increase compared to the 26th year) is shown in the following table:

From the above statistics, it is noteworthy that the average inflation rate of public utilities in January of the 37th year was 59,000 times, while the average inflation rate of the factors that directly affect the price of public utilities in the same month reached 104,000 times, and the inflation rate of the general price index reached more than 150,000 times. Whether public utilities are leading price increases is self-evident.

(3) Calculation Formulas and the Responsibilities of the Public Utilities Bureau

Public utilities are a link in the entire economy. Since the entire economy is undergoing drastic changes, public utility prices cannot help but change accordingly; but the change is passive, not active. This is because the prices of the main factors related to the cost of public utilities are determined separately by the competent authorities. For example, the cost of living index is reviewed and determined monthly by the Shanghai Cost of Living Index Review Committee. The price index for metals is compiled by the Municipal Government Statistics Office based on market prices of metals; the price of coal is determined by the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; the price of oil is determined by the Export-Import Management Committee; and the exchange rate is published by the Central Bank. These price increases affect the increase in the cost of public utilities, so in order to maintain their operations, it is necessary to adjust their prices. Calculating the prices of public utilities requires a set of fair formulas. This formula was formulated by the National Economic Commission based on the statistics of various public utilities. After the draft was sent to Shanghai, it was revised by the Municipal Government together with representatives of the City Council, Mr. Li Wenjie and Mr. Wang Zhuyi, and representatives of the company. The Economic Commission then compiled the final formula and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for promulgation and uniform implementation throughout the country. The main parts of this formula can be divided into "base numbers" and "factors." "Base numbers" are obtained based on statistics, such as how many pounds of coal are required per kilowatt-hour of electricity, which is relatively fixed. "Factors" are variable, such as the current price of each pound of coal. If the product of the base number multiplied by the factor is multiplied by a percentage, the sum is the cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity. The efforts and responsibility of the Public Utilities Bureau lie in doing its best to urge various public utilities to improve efficiency and reduce the "base number." Other "factors," such as the cost of living index, coal prices, oil prices, and foreign exchange, are not within the control of the Public Utilities Bureau and can only hope that other relevant agencies will do their best to control them. In the midst of economic turmoil, the consistent policy of the Public Utilities Bureau is to try its best to stabilize public utilities. We achieved this in the second half of the 35th year, so the Ta Kung Pao's opinion poll at the beginning of the 36th year expressed satisfaction with this. After June of the 36th year, price increases were like wild horses, and the policy of the Public Utilities Bureau was to enable public utilities to maintain operations, allowing price increases but with rules, at most once a month, while taking into account the burden on citizens and maintaining the right to review and reduce prices. Therefore, when we review the prices calculated by public utilities according to the formula each month, three representatives from the City Council also participate and try their best to suppress them, in order to force various public utilities to automatically improve efficiency and reduce the "base number," and even assess the "base number" of labor costs, ordering certain public utility companies not to add any more employees in order to save on labor costs. Why? It is to take into account the burden on citizens, as can be seen from the table below. The highest principle of the Public Utilities Bureau is "do not forget the citizens, do not protect the companies." I believe that the City Council and the Municipal Government have a common desire to act in a way that is responsible to the citizens, while maintaining a fair position and convincing various public utility companies so that they have no complaints.

The Increase Rate of Each Main Factor in February Compared to January

According to this ratio, the percentage that each public utility should increase in February should be higher than the current actual price. See the table below:

(4) Differences in Citizens' Sensitivity

In recent years, the income of ordinary people has naturally continued to increase in numbers due to the depreciation of currency. If everyone's income were calculated according to the cost of living index every month based on the base amount before the war, there would be no problem. However, in fact, there are great differences, and each is different. Therefore, the degree to which each person feels the pressure of prices, and even the degree to which they feel the pressure of public utility prices, also varies greatly. For example, the minimum wage for laborers before the war was 16 yuan per month, but now the base salary has increased to 37 yuan. If calculated according to the January cost of living index of over 92,000 times, the actual monthly wage is more than 3.4 million yuan, more than 200,000 times higher than before the war. As for public school teachers, with a monthly salary of 110 yuan, their monthly income is only 3.145 million yuan according to the latest salary standards, only 34,500 times higher than before the war. Other industries and businesses cannot estimate the multiple of their income in this chaotic and abnormal economic situation, but it can be asserted that it is many times higher than that of public school teachers.

The different multiples of income for the four classes of people (scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants) after the war have created different perceptions of public utility prices. Some citizens, whose income increases according to the cost of living index, feel less pressure from prices, especially from public utility prices; however, those whose income does not increase according to the cost of living index or cannot increase according to the index feel a heavy pressure from prices and public utility fees. We may as well do another analysis.

Before the war, a middle-class family living in Shanghai, enjoying material comforts, spent approximately the following proportions of its income on various expenses:

Rent 20% Public Utility Fees, etc. 20%

Food 20% Entertainment and Savings 20%

Clothing 20% Total 100%

For greater clarity, a brief analysis of the public utility expenses borne by a middle-class family with a monthly income of 200 yuan before the war is as follows:

Electricity (40 kWh) 7.20 yuan

Tap Water (20 cubic meters) 2.20 yuan

Telephone (65 calls) 6.50 yuan

Gas (40 cubic meters) 2.40 yuan

Tram (4 times daily) 6.00 yuan

Total 33.30 yuan

Proportion of Income 16.65%

After the war, if this middle-class family with a base salary of 200 yuan is a public school teacher, their actual income in February of this year would be 5.5 million yuan according to the method promulgated by the central government. If calculated according to the January cost of living index (95,200 times) (A) for the business community, their income would be 19.04 million yuan. (B) If half is calculated according to the cost of living index, their income would be 9.5 million yuan. According to the public utility prices in January, their expenses can be analyzed as follows:

Electricity (40 kWh) 350,000 yuan

Tap Water (20 cubic meters) 173,000 yuan

Telephone (60 calls) 144,000 yuan

Gas (40 cubic meters) 900,000 yuan

Tram (Monthly Pass) 560,000 yuan

(For Public School Teachers 240,000)

Total

(For Public School Teachers) 2,127,000 yuan 1,807,000 yuan

Proportion of Public School Teachers' Income 32%

Proportion of Business Community (A) Income 2.8%

Proportion of Business Community (B) Income 23.6%

According to the above analysis, the public's sensitivity to current public utility prices can be divided into at least three categories: (1) Public school teachers feel a double burden, accounting for about one-third of all expenses, and those who enjoy public utilities beyond this standard bear more than one-third of all expenses. Their various living expenses can be analyzed approximately as follows:

Rent 6% Public Utility Fees, etc. 33%

Food 57% Entertainment 2%

Clothing 2% Total 100%

At the same time, higher-level public school teachers feel even more difficult, because their income cannot increase in a linear proportion to their base salary. (2) For the (A) type of business community, such as industrial workers, public utility expenses are slightly smaller in percentage terms than before the war, because the average inflation rate of public utilities is only 59,000 times, while the cost of living index has reached 95,000 times (January of the 37th year). (3) For the (B) type of business community, the increase in the burden of public utility fees compared to before the war is 7%, which is not too serious. From this analysis, unless the government controls prices effectively, the treatment of public school teachers should be improved to achieve rationality. Furthermore, it can be seen that the prices of public utilities increase according to rules and are not unreasonable. The reason for feeling threatened is the uneven distribution of income among the four classes of people in society. At the same time, the number of people in the entire society whose income can be calculated according to the cost of living index is still small, and undoubtedly, the general public still feels pain. This is a serious social and economic problem that cannot be solved by simply planning from public utilities alone.

(5) Possible Solutions

According to the above explanation, it is clear that the instability of public utility prices is entirely a consequence of economic turmoil. With an unhealthy overall economic system and the continuous rise of the general price track, public utility prices cannot be independently stabilized. Because the economic system is like a set of gears in a clock, with the large gears moving forward, the small gears are forced to move. But even when there is no solution, we should still seek solutions. We have to add a reduction gear to the small public utility gear, that is, to make a mandatory reduction when using the calculation formula, and sell it as an increase in efficiency, which has been explained in Section (3). In addition, the remedial measure is subsidy, which is the most immediate solution among temporary solutions. This point can be discussed in two points as follows:

(A) The direct subsidy system was tried out from March to May of last year, but the results were not good. Because the inherent shortcomings of this system make public utilities rely on the government and not seek improvement. At the same time, it is unfair for the people of the whole country to subsidize the public utilities enjoyed by Shanghai alone. The total direct subsidy figure is huge and needs to be adjusted monthly.

(B) Indirect subsidies, that is, allowing the government to give stable exchange rates for two or three months for the fuels used by public utilities, such as coal, oil, and materials such as alum for water production, so that the cost of public utilities is not directly and completely affected by high exchange rates or price fluctuations, and the inflation rate can be reduced. This method is more likely to be tried out, but in times of currency inflation and devaluation, this measure will inevitably be difficult. For example, when public school teachers were allocated in kind last year, the difference from the market price was not far off at the beginning of the implementation, and the government subsidized a small amount, but in less than a few months, the difference from the market price became huge, turning into a major expenditure for the government. The subsidy policy for transportation, postal, and telecommunications businesses is also the same. Once the government cancels subsidies due to its inability to support them, the intensity of the increase can be predicted. Therefore, if this measure must be implemented, it must continue indefinitely. At the same time, it must also be fully supported by the Central Bank, and technical details may need to be carefully discussed.

### Hongsha Cargo Ship Capsizes in Wind at Huangtiangang Port, Jiangyin

[Report from our Jiangyin Bureau, 2nd] Cai Zhengxi, a native of Tangyin County, Henan Province, loaded 65 tons of red sand (for foundry work) on behalf of Lu Yongxiang at No. 2, Lane 49, Datagu Road, Tongfu Road, Shanghai, and was transporting it from the Jingda River estuary to Shanghai.

### Livestock Epidemic Prevention in Ten Counties in Guizhou Province

[Report from our Guilin Bureau, February 29th] Bovine plague is extremely rampant in Guizhou Province. According to statistics, more than 10,000 cattle died of plague in the past year. The Provincial Government has organized mobile epidemic prevention teams before the spread of bovine plague this spring, which will go to Lingui, Yangshuo, Lipu, Xiuren, Liujiang, Rongxian, Liujiang, Xincheng, Yishan, Hechi, Nandan and other ten counties next month to establish an epidemic prevention line of 600 miles along the highway. All cattle on the ground ten miles to the left and right of the highway will be gathered by the local government to wait for injection. At the same time, because the vaccine is made from cattle, and cattle are expensive, the cost of the vaccine is extremely high, resulting in the failure to implement epidemic prevention work universally in the past. The Guangmen Livestock Conservation Institute has researched and changed to using domestic rabbits to mass-produce low-cost injection solutions, and has successfully manufactured them. After experiments, the results are good. It is expected that the epidemic prevention work of cattle in this province this year can be ensured without worry.

### Garbage Overwhelms Changsha: Monthly Increase of 150 Tons, Pedestrians Can Barely Find Footing on Back Streets

[Report from our Changsha Bureau, 1st] Garbage is piling up in Changsha City. In some remote streets and alleys, pedestrians can barely find a place to put their feet, and all the houses are surrounded by garbage. According to informal estimates, there are at least more than 3 million tons. According to the investigation of the Provincial Police Bureau, because Hunan produces coal, every family in the city uses smokeless coal for cooking. This mixture of coal slag, fruit peels, paper scraps and miscellaneous items produces at least 10 tons of new garbage every day. The police bureau currently has 146 cleaners, and their maximum daily work performance is to clear 5 tons of garbage. The two trucks responsible for transporting the garbage may be dispatched for three days a month. Therefore, in addition to the original garbage that cannot be cleaned up, Changsha City adds at least 150 tons per month, which is 2,000 tons per year.

### A Tour of Xianghui College, the Successor to Fudan After its Relocation; A Vast Paradise at the Head of the Jialing River

In the morning, the air is fresh. We take a tourist bus from Chongqing to Beibei, and the scenery along the way is beautiful, making us feel very happy. In a moment, we arrive at Beibei Station. Passing through the clean streets of Beibei, we take a ferry from the pier to the other side of the river, and slowly climb up hundreds of stone steps. Then, we are in Xiaba - "Paradise".

Xiaba, like Huaxi Dam and Shaping Dam, is a well-known birthplace of academic culture. The National Fudan University laid its foundation here, and during the War of Resistance against Japan, everyone knew about it, both domestically and abroad. Now that Fudan has relocated back to Shanghai, the newly established private Xianghui College is thriving on this fertile land. Moreover, the French parasol trees along the road are arranged neatly like two rows of geese in formation. Two bicycles chase each other swiftly, as if searching for the spring light. The warm sunlight shines on the roof of Deng Hui Hall, and the glass windows reflect shimmering gold, making the majestic building appear even more magnificent.

We walk out of the reception room with President Xu Fengxi, talking as we go, leaving a portrait of the beautiful Paradise.

Full of Energy

President Xu was formerly the Dean of Students at Fudan University, a well-known psychologist. He is very stout, with a large belly, and speaks and walks with authority, full of energy. Hanging high in the auditorium are inscriptions by party and state elders: one by the late Chairman Lin, "Virtue Reigns Supreme"; one by Chairman Chiang, "High Esteem"; and one by Inspector-General Yu, "Study to Serve the Country." Rows of long benches are marked with student numbers, and there is no disorder when students take their assigned seats during meetings. The exam hall is set up in this sacred and inviolable place, and the surrounding arrangements are filled with a solemn atmosphere, dignified and majestic!

The classrooms are scattered on both sides of the auditorium, with a total of about twenty, large and small. The intensity of light and the position of the windows are carefully considered. Outside the doors of two large classrooms, the corridors are crowded with students, listening attentively to the lectures inside, some hurriedly taking notes, and some with a knowing smile on their lips. The desire for knowledge drives them, and they don't seem to feel the fatigue in their waists and legs at all.

The Xianghui Library's collection of books in the stacks is not large, but the number of newspapers and magazines displayed in the reading room is not small. However, from the constant stream of people going in and out in front of the door, and from the busy people working at their desks in the quiet room, it is particularly evident that "there are too many monks and too little gruel." President Xu has the same feeling. He says very frankly, "What we lack most is books." My friend Wei Shoufu, a reporter, will launch an "Xianghui Alumni Association" and prepare for a book donation campaign. May it be successful soon. Mental food is in the academy, and how serious is that panic!

In the male dormitories, most of the doors of each building and each room are open, and red paper couplets are pasted on the doors of every household, creating a new atmosphere. The female dormitories are mostly closed, and security is very strict everywhere in the courtyard. The ban "Men are Not Allowed" is posted high on the wall. However, next to the bamboo fence, there are quite a few young men and women talking intimately.

The Youth Welfare Society has departments for postal and telecommunications, social events, food, laundry, barbering... Although the place is small, it has everything, and it is economical and convenient. The Gongyan Club broadcasts current affairs and music every night. More than a thousand teachers and students from the entire school gather here, "worrying about the world's troubles before anyone else, and enjoying the world's pleasures after everyone else."

On the sports field, two teams of girls are competing in basketball. At this time, the score is seven to seven, and the game is very close and hard-fought.

Passing around the farm, deep in the green woods, is the professors' residence - Fudan New Village.

Sharing Joy and Hardship

The professors are busy with research and teaching, and the professors' wives are just as busy in the kitchen. The education sector has always been a noble but impoverished profession, and it is rare that they are willing to share joy and hardship together.

Mr. Zhang Mosheng, the director of the Department of Chinese Literature and History, has a silver beard and talks endlessly about his stories during the War of Resistance, very energetically. Professor Xu Dean is an expert in philology and loves to talk about alliteration and reduplication. Director Fang Jing of the Department of Foreign Languages' words are full of rich poetic meaning. Professor Zhou Tongdan is the great disciple of Master Xiong Shili, with a dignified appearance. Liu Juemin, the director of the Department of Economics, is currently the president of the Central Daily News in the wartime capital, and speaks with diplomatic language. Professor Sun Liangong's hair is almost bald. Professor Bai Jimei's voice is still very loud.

The student dining hall is divided into male and female sections, and the meals are simple and plain, with rarely any special dishes. The female students' meal fees are the lowest, only over 100,000 yuan last month. The atmosphere of diligence, hard work, and frugality is most prevalent here, and suits and Western clothes are not valued. Currently, there are a total of four types of scholarships and grants: Xiangbo Scholarship, Denghui Grant, Tang Fenglai Scholarship, and Lan Wenbin Grant. Although the amount is not large, it is not easy to obtain, so once you are nominated, your worth increases tenfold, no wonder the examination system can be so strict.

There are dozens of various new and old newspaper and magazine societies and organizations. However, they are all mainly "academic", and there is no room for party activities. Even hometown associations are prohibited. Academic independence and freedom of thought are the greatest characteristics of Xianghui College, and this spirit is especially worthy of

The buildings in the Hanbing Hall and the Journalism Hall areas, it is said that they will be used to add Xianghui Middle School this spring. The affiliated Lixue Primary School will also increase the number of classes. If famous professors can be hired, the long-planned journalism department, horticulture department, etc. can be established immediately. "Xianghui University" will definitely be realized within three years.

Dean of Instruction Dr. Shao Xiufeng told the reporter about the founding process in great detail. Before leaving, he said, "Now, Mr. Ma Xiangbo and Mr. Li Denghui have both passed away, and the significance of our school commemorating the two educators is even more special and important!"

The Jialing River is constantly rolling with green waves, with the back waves pushing the front waves. The splashes of water lightly hit the small boat, like bright pearls... As the reporter went up the river and stepped onto the North Wenquan Highway to North Hot Springs, looking down from the top of the mountain at that vast paradise, a kind impression was vaguely reflected in my eyes. I wish the youth in Basha, like the flowers of spring and the fruits of autumn, forever flourish and grow strong! (Reported by Yin Wei in Chongqing in February of the 37th year of the Republic.)

### Xiangdao Football Report - Special Silver Shield, Chinese Teams Dominate - Xingdao and Dongfang Gain Final Rights - Xingdao Triumphantly Defeats Buses · Dongfang Bravely Conquers Jiezhi

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] The football schedule for Saturday (the 27th) was, as listed, the Special Silver Shield semi-finals, with two matches played at the Causeway Bay Ground and the Police Ground respectively. As a result of the battles, Xingdao won against Buses, and Dongfang overwhelmed Jiezhi, with both scores being two to one, thus leading to a situation where Xingdao and Dongfang compete for supremacy. In the Group B matches, the Naval B team eliminated with a score of four to one. The Buses B team, Nanhua rallied with determination, defeating Zhonghua three to one, and will compete with the Naval B team for the Group B championship. Let's first look at the battle on the Causeway Bay side, where Xingdao and Buses fought fiercely. Comparing their lineups, Buses was not as good as Xingdao, but the Tiger team was affected by Song Lingsheng's knee injury, which prevented him from playing, and the defense suffered. Furthermore, the forwards encountered Buses' tight defense. He Yingfen and Zhu Yongqiang were injured one after another, Tan Jiangbai committed eight fouls, and Qian Chihui even used his fists to hit Xu Jingcheng. As both were Chinese teams, they really shouldn't have played like that!

Speaking of the performances of both sides, Xingdao was better than Buses in both technique and experience, and Buses was even inferior to Xingdao in the application of tactics. After the start of the battle, we clearly saw that Buses attempted to subdue Xingdao with brute force. Jiangbai first injured Yingfen, and after scoring a penalty kick, the entire team retreated to defend, adopting a "man-to-man" marking style to deal with Xingdao,抢ball whenever possible, hoping to maintain the lead. Unfortunately, Buses' strategist overlooked one point: a match lasts for ninety minutes. If you want to retreat and defend after scoring a goal in the first half, without any offense, how can you withstand the beating? As expected, in the last ten minutes, Buses' defenders were exhausted, and although they injured Zhu Yongqiang again, the Tiger team finally equalized the score.

Looking at the battle situation: it was only tense, not exciting. At the beginning of the match, the Tiger team rushed to the front, and Jinhe shot wide, while Zhaorong lost a series of opportunities in front of the goal. At the fourteenth minute, Jiangbai injured Yingfen. In the chaos, Buses took the opportunity to counterattack, and Shuoyou got the ball and shot, hitting the post and bouncing out. Wenzhi rushed forward and was blocked by Songsheng. Xingdao was penalized with a penalty kick, which Shuoyou scored. At this time, Yingfen returned to the field and switched positions with Yongqiang, but his movements were not as agile as before. In the first half, Xingdao lost first. In the second half, Buses intended to retreat and defend, but Xingdao attacked fiercely. However, Buses set up a human wall, and the Tiger team forced six corner kicks one after another, but achieved nothing. After thirty-two minutes, Yongqiang was kicked injured and left the field. Seeing that it was about to end, Jinhai was forced to rush forward to assist in the attack. Once, Yingfen took a corner kick. In the melee in Buses' territory, Songsheng scored in the chaos, after the tie, the Tiger team continued to advance bravely, forcing another corner kick. Jinhe kicked well, and Zhaorong hooked the ball in with his foot, two to one, Xingdao won the final victory.

On the Police Ground side, there was also a semi-final battle, with Jiezhi and Dongfang competing for supremacy. Jiezhi's condition has not been very active recently, while Dongfang has made progress. You Huaxing of Jiezhi took the field after recovering from illness, and Huang Jingcong's leg injury has not yet healed, which is even more worrying.

Looking at the entire match, Jiezhi had tried its best to fight. It maintained an undefeated record in the first half and even scored first in the second half, but it conceded two goals in just two minutes. Jiezhi's defense should be responsible for this. Originally, in a close match, in addition to skill, luck and audience support are also needed. This battle was like this. Jiezhi shot the ball three times, all hitting the goal post, and the audience enthusiastically cheered for Dongfang, who was finally able to reverse the situation.

After the first half ended in a draw, the two teams engaged in a fierce battle in the second half. In the twelfth minute, Dongfang launched an attack, and Guo Yingqi broke through and scored a single-handedly, one to zero. After thirty minutes, Li Deqi scored two goals in two minutes, securing Dongfang's final qualification and sending Jiezhi away in frustration.

In practice, it is even lower than the 25% rent reduction system implemented in the mainland. In order to reduce the burden on tenant farmers, improve the living conditions of tenant farmers, and improve production conditions. Since the provincial government implemented the system of leasing out public land, it has recently promoted the implementation of the 25% rent reduction system to private landlords, so that the rent of Taiwan Province can be generally reduced.

### Second Collection of Poems by Youren

— Lu Danlin

By Yu Youren, published by Datong Bookstore

The old-style poems of revolutionaries can be roughly divided into two styles. One is to imitate the ancients as much as possible, with profound meanings and lingering emotions; the other is to use modern terminology, emanating from nature, and possessing a sense of the times. The former is exemplified by the poems of Zhang Binglin, Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, and others. The latter is exemplified by the poems of Huang Xing, Ma Junwu, Xu Zhu, and others. This is what scholars of revolutionary figures know.

Recently, I read Mr. Yu Youren's "Second Collection of Poems by Youren." His poems use modern terminology seamlessly and fully express a sense of the times and a sense of justice. In literary terms, it is purely revolutionary literature by revolutionaries, poetry born in the great era of the twentieth century. It is distinctly different from the works of some poets that could be placed in poetry collections from a hundred years ago or eight or nine hundred years ago, without easily distinguishing their era or author. In my memory, this seems to be the fourth time Mr. Yu's poetry collection has been printed, and the most comprehensive one was the "Annotations on the Poems of Youren" annotated by Wang Luyi. However, the majority of the works collected in this "Second Collection of Poems by Youren" belong to the period of the War of Resistance. He wrote them from the 22nd year to the 35th year of the Republic of China. Strictly speaking, our country had already begun the War of Resistance after September 18th. Therefore, this poetry collection can be said to be Mr. Yu's poetic history of the War of Resistance. Moreover, the majority of the poems in it are related to the War of Resistance. Therefore, the conclusion that it is a poetic history of the War of Resistance is most appropriate.

On his birthday in the 34th year, he wrote two seven-character quatrains, which say: "The wish to cultivate and herd the rivers and mountains remains unfulfilled; crossing the river to escape death becomes a chronicle. This year I happen to encounter Labor Day, and the artillery orphan has already turned white." "Born on a day filled with a hundred worries, the Zhongshan lineage cuts Ryukyu; the alliance rises to fight for all mankind, not just singing for Asia." This is none other than Mr. Yu's autobiography. Because when he was born, it was precisely when the Qing court was昏庸 and 朝政 was corrupt, and foreign troubles were pressing. Therefore, in his youth, he held great aspirations to cultivate and herd the rivers and mountains. Being an artillery orphan refers to the fact that his mother passed away not long after he was born, and he was raised by his aunt and lived with his maternal grandparents. He made paper artillery as a child, hence this poem.

The poem "Seeing Wounded Soldiers on the Huangpi Road at Dusk During Mid-Autumn Festival" contains not only compassion but also the spirit of rising up to kill the enemy. The poem says: "The wounded soldiers sigh and sigh again, the sun sets and the moon rises again. The crickets in the world love to admire the moon, but they do not know that enemy planes use the moon to wound our bones. The bright moon wanes, our bones ache; the bright moon fades, our bones are cold. The nation's life is fighting on a single thread, and we are fortunate to participate in the sacred war. Singing and dancing before the army celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival, but it is a pity that we cannot see it in shifts. Tonight the bright moon is round and round again, surely our army will break the barbarian sky. Break the barbarian sky, break the barbarian sky, our bodies are willing to be sacrificed for the country." In this, one can almost hear their voices.

The poems are also accompanied by lyrics and tunes. These works also possess the same sense of the times as the poems, with different tunes but the same skill. There are no narrow-minded or dry phrases. He created new styles of poetry, lyrics, and tunes to meet the needs of the times and provide a model for the literary world in an era of rising voices and contending schools. His broadness of mind and artistic conception, like the sincerity of skill manifested outwardly, can all be comprehended from his works. Now, let's take the lyrics he wrote in the tune of "Jin Lou Qu" in the 27th year of the Republic of China when his fellow villagers visited him and described the magnificence of his hometown and family mountains, and urged him to return north. The lyrics say: "Everything starts from scratch, with a few gray hairs, Master, a lifetime of lakes and seas, how many old friends remain? Bao E and Ying Liu, friends of Han Zhi, how many have become martyrs! To this day, who do we rely on in the wind and clouds? People say the homeland is truly magnificent, a good homeland, but it takes effort to manage. South and north, the situation is fraught with troubles. The great war of heaven and earth is unprecedented. Ashamed I was born at the foot of Mount 嵯峨, in the same village as Wei Gong. Not pursuing fame as a Confucian scholar or a general, I have something to ponder even in old age. I expect that in this world, you know what it is like! Hearing that three million have died in battle, I am even more willing for blood to stain the history of creation. Seeking a homeland, for freedom only." Public-spirited and selfless, his words are filled with a heroic spirit that soars to the heavens.

As for the tunes, let's take the one dedicated to the posthumous portrait of Zhang Taiyan as a representative. When Mr. Yu ran the Shanghai Shenzhou Daily, he was known as the "old master of Shenzhou." After the Min Yu Daily was closed by the Qing government, he went to Tokyo, and Zhang Taiyan said to him: "I am also an old master of Shenzhou, how can I not help you!" The tune is [Shuang Diao Bo Bu Duan] Ling, which says: "From Min Hu to Min Yu, we were both masters of Shenzhou in those years. Feigning old age and imprisonment was like acting a primary role, grieving for the times, throwing down the pen and weeping like a fisherman. At this time, does the teacher know?" According to the text, 本初 refers to Yuan Shikai, and a fisherman refers to Song Jiaoren.

After reading Mr. Yu's poems, lyrics, and tunes, even though we have only tasted a small portion, we can infer the rest. It is the voice of the times, the writing of blood and spirit, fully expressing the author's personality.

There is one point in the book that seems debatable, which is that some of the works have annotations attached, using the third person, but it is not indicated who the annotations are from, which is a bit inappropriate. Because the book only states "Author: Yu Youren," it is hoped that the name of the annotator will be added in the reprint, so that the readers know.

### "New Treatise on Consciousness-Only"

— Su Zhongxiang

By Xiong Shili, published by Commercial Press

"New Treatise on Consciousness-Only" (新唯識論), written by Mr. Xiong Shili of Huanggang, existed in a classical Chinese version long before the war. I once read a thread-bound edition of the classical Chinese version printed on Lian Shi paper. During the war, Mr. Xiong himself and his disciples translated it into a vernacular version, which was published by the Commercial Press. In the classical Chinese version, Mr. Xiong said that he intended to divide his work into two parts: one was "Treatise on the Realm" (境論), discussing ontology, and the other was "Treatise on Measurement" (量論), discussing epistemology. The classical Chinese version of the New Treatise (abbreviated as 新論) was the "Treatise on the Realm" part, while the "Treatise on Measurement" had not yet been written. By the time the vernacular version was published, Mr. Xiong further stated that if the "Treatise on Measurement" was completed, it would be published as a separate book. Therefore, the New Treatise would no longer be called the "Treatise on the Realm."

This is a philosophical book with weight and value. It is intense, heavy, and serious. As the Western proverb says, "Style is the man." If this is true, then this painstaking work can give us a glimpse into Mr. Xiong's rigorous style of scholarship and personality. Mr. Xiong poured his lifelong learning into this book. After that, he mostly communicated with people through short, recorded sayings and rarely wrote formal treatises. This is a major gain for the Chinese intellectual world in recent decades. If we use Mr. Cao Juren's praise for Mr. Feng Youlan, this is also a great harvest for the Chinese intellectual world in nearly five hundred years. Therefore, its importance to Chinese scholars is self-evident. In recent years, the emergence of "New Neo-Confucianism" and this book are considered the two most noteworthy events in the Chinese philosophical world. What this book proclaims is far deeper and more intricate than Mr. Feng Youlan's New Neo-Confucianism in terms of its inner meaning and implications. However, the attention and discussion it has generated among Chinese scholars is only slightly less than that of New Neo-Confucianism. The great influence of this book can be seen from this.

The whole book is divided into three volumes and nine chapters. The meaning is profound, comprehensive, and far-reaching, which cannot be elaborated in a short article. Generally speaking, it develops, corrects, and integrates the Great Yijing and the old Consciousness-Only school, taking the teacher's arguments and forging an entire theoretical system by making the ontological hypothesis of "constant transformation" (恒轉). Constant transformation has two functions: "contraction" (翕) and "expansion" (闢). Expansion gathers the mind, and contraction gathers objects. The myriad things in the universe are formed by this constant flow of momentary arising and ceasing caused by contraction and expansion: using the manifest substance and unifying substance with function, it is vigorous, strong, and renews itself daily, without end.

We do not make an evaluation of Mr. Xiong's book, but this does not mean that we acknowledge that this book is an impeccable truth. Frankly speaking, this book is the crystallization of Mr. Xiong's lifelong learning and painstaking effort. Its choice of words and creation of meaning all have specific purposes. We ask ourselves, we know too little about the Great Yijing and Consciousness-Only to make any comments. What we particularly express our joy in is that Mr. Xiong's efforts and style serve as a conscious symbol of a new stage in the Chinese intellectual world.

This meaning may not be fully expressed in a few words. I only intend to elaborate on this idea.

If I were to rashly divide it, I believe that Chinese thought in the last hundred years has gone through three stages. The first stage was from the late Qing Dynasty to the May Fourth Movement. The scholars of that time were mostly either attached to the internal while neglecting the external, or fundamentally ignored Western culture. Or they shouted "Chinese learning as the essence, Western learning for practical use." They still regarded Chinese culture as the mainstay. The second stage should be from the May Fourth Movement to around the September 18th Incident. At this time, the trend among scholars often concerned the internal while being attached to the external. They always advocated overthrowing all native culture and completely Westernizing. Mr. Feng Youlan gave a detailed explanation of these two situations when discussing the people of the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China.

Generally speaking, the scholars in these two periods had several shortcomings in their understanding of Chinese and Western cultures. That is, emotional, fragmented, and superficial. Because they valued emotion, they could not objectively examine the good and bad with reason and often mixed personal likes and dislikes. The slogan of throwing all thread-bound books into the outhouse is one example. Because it was fragmented, they always generalized from the particular and did not have a comprehensive view, let alone establish their own complete theory. People in the May Fourth era were accustomed to making comparative lists, such as saying: "Chinese culture is static, Western culture is dynamic; Chinese culture is moral, Western culture is scientific; Chinese culture is spiritual, Western culture is material... etc." (This kind of statement is still popular today). Regardless of whether these adjectives are appropriate or not, simply using a list of adjectives to clearly distinguish between Chinese and Western cultures is clearly messy and unproductive. Also, because it is superficial, they could not discern what the fundamental differences between Chinese and Western cultures were and why there were such differences. To sum it up in one sentence, they still did not have a fundamental, profound, and comprehensive view. These regrets gradually changed until the era of national crisis. Liang Shuming, Ma Yifu, Zhang Dongsun, Feng Youlan, and Mr. Xiong can be regarded as representatives of this third stage. These scholars generally have a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of Chinese and Western cultures, and they can come up with a set of theories of their own. Although there are gains and losses, this trend is valuable. And the "New Treatise" is one of the most brilliant examples. In this, one can see Mr. Xiong's understanding of logic, his personal, complete, and unique understanding of Western philosophy, one can see the crystallization of Mr. Xiong's calm thinking, and one can see Mr. Xiong's adoption of ancient Indian orthodox thought and Chinese orthodox thought, creating a complete and profound system. Regardless of the success or failure of the system, this book represents a symbol of the awakening of Chinese scholars, represents the characteristics of the third stage of modern Chinese thought, and is one of the most outstanding and successful representatives.

For such a serious Mr. Xiong, for such a scholar and his crystallization who is not moved by wealth, honor, and minor achievements, we would like to express our respect.

### Reading "Modern Chinese Grammar"

— Pingxi

By Wang Li, published by Commercial Press

This is a rare and good book. Apart from two or three other similar books that can be used as references, it is almost the only book worth recommending that discusses modern Chinese grammar at present. The nature of this book can be seen from its title. Generally speaking:

(1) Chinese: In the past, we have had many specialized books on the study of grammar, but although those books used the language of our own country as the object, the methods they adopted were purely Western. Some books since "Ma's Grammar" (馬氏文通), such as those by Zhang Shizhao and others, and those used in general schools, almost all copied some ready-made Western grammatical principles, classifications, and tabular solutions. This book is Chinese in nature. It never tries to imitate Western grammar in a far-fetched way, and more of it is completely creative. Therefore, it is very consistent with real Chinese.

(2) Modern: Some Chinese grammarians in the past often ignored the factor of the times and failed to grasp the linguistic characteristics of each era from the history of linguistics. Therefore, they often lumped together some ancient materials, from the Four Books and Five Classics to unofficial histories and novels, as research materials. As a result, there were many contradictions and, at the same time, they were out of touch with the living modern language. That is certainly not a reasonable study. In this book, the author tries his best to take the existing language as the object. Therefore, it is most practical, and readers will not misunderstand the era or confuse the ancient with the present.

(3) Grammar: The divergence between language and writing is more acute in China than in the West. Even today, after the success of the New Literature Movement, the distance between language and writing is still far. Generally speaking, grammar refers to the grammar of vernacular Chinese other than classical Chinese, but in this book, it has a narrower meaning. The author's basic requirement is that it is limited to spoken language. Spoken language has some things that can only be said and cannot be written, so it is not exactly vernacular Chinese. Why study the rules of spoken language? Presumably, it is because the text is moving towards this direction day by day, demanding to be alive.

Speaking of Chinese grammar, it has always been a blank page. There are some specialized books like elementary schools in ancient times, but at most they only study function words, such as works like "Interpretations of Words in Classics and Commentaries" (經傳釋詞). Later, Ma Jianzhong's "Grammar" (文通) was epoch-making, but in fact, it only picked up Western grammatical dogmas and could not truly explain the movement laws of Chinese literary (linguistic) grammar. In addition, some people think that Chinese writing or Chinese language cannot be explained by rules because it seems too chaotic, too illusory, or too different from Western grammar. Then, due to the efforts of many down-to-earth workers, Chinese grammar has a dawn of foundation. Among the new researchers of literary grammar, Mr. Wang Li is a scholar with the same authority as Mr. Lu Shuxiang. This book will undoubtedly lay down undeniable principles in some aspects. However, compared with other grammar books, it also has its own characteristics. These characteristics can be roughly divided into:

(1) It takes a single sentence as a research entity as a whole, and does not first divide it into characters, words, and then discuss sentences. This is one of the peculiarities of Chinese characters. On the one hand, each Chinese character has only a fixed shape and does not have any changes. On the other hand, it is because Chinese characters have too many functional changes, and they must be observed embedded in a fixed sentence.

(2) It automatically creates new terms to apply, and only uses Western grammar terms in some less important or general places. This can avoid a lot of unnecessary trouble. For example, regarding nouns, other grammar books still cannot forget the constraints of "gender," "number," "case," etc., which are omitted in this book. In addition, it does not use diagrams to illustrate much.

(3) It starts lively from the standpoint of utility. Researchers of Chinese grammar can be roughly divided into two schools. One school takes form as the route, which is the oldest school. The other school examines the character of a character or word from the meaning of the text or language. The author of this book seems to investigate from another point of view, taking the utility of text and language as the warp and weft everywhere. Therefore, it is also the most practical.

This book is divided into two volumes, with more than 600 pages and nearly 300,000 words. It is more troublesome to introduce the content, and at the same time, the space does not allow it. Some of the original ideas and essence of this book have been mentioned in Mr. Zhu Muqing's long preface before the book, so I will not elaborate on it. Roughly speaking, this book is divided into six chapters in addition to the introduction of ten pages, which talks about what is a language, what is Chinese grammar, and what is modern Chinese grammar. Chapter 1, "Sentence Construction (Part 1)," lists the units of text, such as characters, words, word classes, word types, idioms, and sentences, and then talks about the form of sentences. The author divides them into narrative sentences, descriptive sentences, and judgmental sentences, which are very consistent with the nature of Chinese language. The next chapter is the continuation of the previous chapter, listing various sentence patterns and giving detailed reviews. It also expresses many things that people have not yet expressed. Chapter 3 is "Grammatical Components," which is aimed at "Understanding Components." All those that are removed are some nouns, numerals, adjectives, verbs, etc. that make people understand the content. All adverbs, pronouns, copulas, conjunctions, interjections, and "marks" that only make the tone of the sentence exist are discussed. Chapter 4, "Substitution Method and Numbering Method," is the most brilliant, discussing every pronoun and numeral used daily, and pointing out how to apply them. "Special Forms" are some exceptions in Chinese grammar, especially unrelated to Western grammar, so a separate Chapter 5 is set up. Chapter 6, which is also the last chapter, discusses "Europeanized Grammar," pointing out how Chinese characters are changing their nature under the promotion of intellectuals, how language is changing, and how it is merging with world languages. Generally speaking, each chapter and each section is very complete, and each is attached with definitions, exercises, error corrections, notes, and comparative grammar for the practical use of schools or personal self-study.

However, this book also has its shortcomings. The most important thing is the improper use of cited materials, because although "Dream of the Red Chamber" and other books are written in standard language, they are always records of the linguistic forms of a hundred years ago, which are not realistic enough. In the discussion of Europeanization, it is also a mistake not to quote sentences from translated books. Secondly, it does not thoroughly study dialects and does not take into account the colloquialisms of ordinary non-intellectuals and workers and peasants. It seems that the atmosphere of "writing" exceeds that of "speech." Furthermore, some classifications are too cumbersome and cannot be combined more essentially. Finally, the author ignores some special languages that people say, such as the rules of dialects and proverbs, which makes the book unable to feel more complete.

In addition to this book, the same author has another book, "Chinese Grammar Theory," which is biased towards theory, not as this book is biased towards rules. It is more profound and more fundamental. Unfortunately, it has not been published to this day, otherwise, it can somewhat supplement the lack of elaboration on the principles of this book.

### Criticism of "Tao Yuanming's Critique"

— Zhang Mingchun

By Xiao Wangqing, published by Kaiming Bookstore

Like many lovers of classical poetry, I enjoy Tao poetry and criticism of Tao poetry. Any work related to Tao poetry, I make sure to visit the library within my travel capabilities; any books and periodicals I can afford, I make sure to purchase.

Recently, after reading Mr. Xiao Wangqing's "Tao Yuanming's Critique," I wanted to say a few words.

From Liang Xiaotong to the present, there have been hundreds of critics of Tao poetry. Not to mention the distant past, since returning to China, the following works in this area may as well be counted from Mr. Liang Qichao: (1) "Liang Qichao's Tao Yuanming" (First edition by Commercial Press in 1923). (2) "Tao Yuanming Special Issue," eight to twelve issues, a total of five issues (1926, Guoxue Yuebao [National Studies Monthly]). (3) "Ding Fubao's Annotations on Tao Yuanming's Poetry" (First edition by Medical Bookstore in 1927), including Zhou Yunqing and Xiao Tong's "Annotations on Tao Yuanming's Biography." (4) "Chuan Donghua's Selected Annotations of Tao Yuanming's Poetry" (First edition by Commercial Press in 1927), including "Chuan's Revised Chronology of Tao Yuanming." (5) "Zai Zhaoming's Jottings on Reading Tao" (1943, Gujin Zazhi [Ancient and Modern Magazine]. During the enemy-occupied period, someone was asked to copy and send it, but the issue number was not specified. (6) "Zhou Zuoren's Small Notes on Tao Collection" (See "Bitter Mouth, Sweet Mouth," first edition by Taiping Bookstore in 1944). (7) "Chen Yinque's On the Relationship between Tao Yuanming's Thought and Pure Conversation" (Full text not seen). (8) "Zhang Mingchun's On the Origin of Tao Yuanming's Thought in Zhuang Zhou" (June 25, 1946, Wen Shi Zhoukan [Literature and History Weekly], Central Daily News). "Examination of Misprinted Characters in Tao Collection" (June 1, 1946, Yangyang, Central Daily News). "Supplementary Annotations to Tao Collection" (June 18, 1946, Yangyang, Central Daily News). (9) "Guo Yintian's Tao Ji's Economic Life" (September 10, 1946, Su Yangyang, Central Daily News). "Tao Qian's Social Life" (1946, Yangyang, Central Daily News). "Tao Qian's Soul" (October 16, 1946, Yangyang, Central Daily News). "Tao Qian's Achievements in Poetry Art" (October 17, 1946, Yangyang, Central Daily News). "Tao Qian's Outlook on Life and Society" (Cultural Vanguard, Volume 6, Issue 19). (10) "Zhu Guangqian's Tao Yuanming" (October 13, 1946, Literary and Art Weekly, Dagong Bao, Issues 1 and 2). (11) "Kong Yang's Tao Yuanming and Wine" (January 8, 1947, Yangyang, Central Daily News). (12) "Jiang Shuliang's My View of Tao Yuanming" (March 16, 1947, Literary and Art Weekly, Dagong Bao, Issue 23). (13) "Xu Chengyu's Talking About Idle Feelings Fu" (May 12, 1947, Literature and History Weekly, Central Daily News, Issue 40). (14) "Chu Wanfeng's Preface to Supplementary Annotations on Tao Yuanming's Shujiu Shi [Poem Describing Wine]" (May 12, 1947, Literature and History Weekly, Central Daily News, Issue 41). (15) "Bao Guangbao's Examination of Tao Yuanming's Stringless Qin" (July 14, 1947, Literature and History Weekly, Central Daily News, Issue 50). (16) "Guo Moruo's Notes on Painting" (Searching for Past and Present Pu Jian, first edition by Haiyan Bookstore in July 1947. (This is a special discussion on Qu Yuan and Tao Yuanming.) (17) "Xiao Wangqing's Tao Yuanming's Critique" (Kaiming edition, July 1947).

Among these, the more systematic and insightful works, in my opinion, should also be considered Mr. Xiao Wangqing's work. Perhaps works of criticism and textual research are similar in nature to dictionaries and encyclopedias, the later the more perfect? We might as well say that the work of studying Tao Yuanming, up to Mr. Xiao, seems to have reached a stage where it can be concluded.

Mr. Xiao's strength lies in not blindly following others and unconditionally praising all of Tao's poems, especially the four-character poems. Before reading his chapter "On Tao Yuanming's Four-Character Poems," I was very worried, fearing that he would criticize "Ting Yun" [Stopping Clouds] and "Gui Niao" [Returning Birds], which I have always considered to have reached the pinnacle of art, as being worthless. There are nine four-character poems in Tao's poetry, and he pointed out the flaws in seven of them. It seems that he uniquely reserved "Ting Yun" and "Gui Niao" for me, which he also considered to be the most subtle and perfect poems. My appreciation has been tested once in disguise.

"Ting Yun" and "Gui Niao" will be like two eternally fresh apples, forever secreting fragrance!

Mr. Xiao's interpretation of "Gui Niao" truly grasps the poet's soul and seeks out the poet's mental activity when creating. This is arguably the most brilliant part of the book.

Mr. Xiao has hardly any criticism of Tao Yuanming's articles. From the perspective of his book title "Tao Yuanming Criticism," this is not comprehensive. Because Tao Yuanming's articles occupy a non-negligible position in the Tao collection. Looking at any selection of classical Chinese prose, Tao's articles have the most chances of being selected. This is a universally recognized fact that does not need statistical figures to prove. His articles, though few, have many styles, including travelogues, rhapsodies, biographies, letters, elegies, and self-eulogies. It seems that he intentionally left us one or two model works for each genre. With Mr. Xiao's cultivation, he should have a good discussion on this aspect.

Mr. Xiao said, "The research on Tao Yuanming had an outline in the Song Dynasty." This is correct. "During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there was no new development." This is only partially correct. In fact, since Zhong Rong, almost every literati with a collection of poems and articles passed down to posterity has always loved to mention Tao Yuanming. Gui Youguang of the Ming Dynasty called "Yuanming a person of ancient times who was good at dealing with poverty." Wei Bozi of the Qing Dynasty once lamented, "Later generations learn Tao, not learning his person but learning his poetry. How can Tao Gong's poetry be learned by learning his poetry?" These discussions are all good materials for supplementing anecdotes about Tao Yuanming's poetry.

Mr. Xiao also said, "At this time, no materials about this aspect can be found in the Yuan Dynasty." It should be known that we can find a lot in Yuan Yishan's collection. And there is a special quatrain on Tao Yuanming: "Everything is naturally fresh and eternally new, luxury is exhausted to see true purity, the northern window is brighter than the emperor Yi, it does not harm Yuanming as a Jin person." What I have proposed is not important, but it proves that the Ming and Qing Dynasties did have information about Tao that we do not know. Also, as far as I know, in Chen Tingzhuo's Bai Yuzhai Ci Hua [White Rain Cottage Ci Talks], Wang Guowei's Renjian Ci Hua [Human Words on Ci], Lu Xun's Complete Works, and Wu Mi's Kong Xuan Shi Hua [Empty Pavilion Poetry Talks], there are very insightful fragments on Tao.

Mr. Xiao's discussion of Tao Yuanming's thoughts is very pertinent. I admire this passage of his very much: "...He accepted the Confucian spirit of being strict with oneself and taking responsibility for hard work, admired the Lao-Zhuang realm of purity, tranquility, and nature (but did not fall into decadent mysticism), and also touched upon the Buddhist concepts of emptiness, compassion, and sympathy. Strangely, he also incorporated the spirit of knight-errantry." (Page 22 of the original book) The only regret is that Mr. Xiao elaborated less on the greatness of Yuanming's spirit. ""This is also a son of man, and should be treated well." ("Tao Yuanming's Biography"). "Landing as brothers, why must it be flesh and blood relatives." ("Miscellaneous Poems") If we can steal the remaining strands of this kind of universal love to be human, it must be more meaningful and valuable than merely "imitating Tao" in poetry.

Mr. Xiao said that "Yuanming has poems of wandering immortals" (page 29 of the original book), and added a title mark next to the three characters of wandering immortals poems. It is acceptable to say that some of Yuanming's poems have the atmosphere of wandering immortals, but the Tao collection categorically has no special chapter of wandering immortals poems.

In short, this book of three chapters (Chapter 1: The Historical Image of Tao Yuanming. Chapter 2: On Tao Yuanming's Four-Character Poems. Chapter 3: The Art of Tao Yuanming's Five-Character Poems), forty pages, is worth reading. Not only are his insights valuable, but the articles are also full of poetic flavor.

### A Concise Table of National Administrative Divisions

— Song Shi

(Edited by the Ministry of Interior, published by Commercial Press)

It is said that in a certain school's entrance examination, some candidates wrote that Shenyang is located in Shandong Province. High school graduates are still like this, let alone students below the secondary level? Even the general public is often confused about the national territory and administrative system. On the one hand, the country's own regional divisions are also changing: the increase in municipalities directly under the central government; the independence of Mongolia; the transformation of the Northeast from one province to nine provinces, and the territory of the nine provinces has also undergone changes; in addition to the capital, there is also a secondary capital. All of these make the general public's understanding of administrative divisions even more blurred.

The reason for this is nothing more than the lack of a correct and clear book on administrative divisions. The maps and books on the market are almost all pieced together by searching east and west. As a result, there are several different versions of the size of Nanjing City. What is the exact area of ​​the country? There are also no accurate statistics. The publication of the newly compiled "National Administrative Divisions" by the Ministry of Interior after returning to the capital can be said to be very timely. Although the content such as the area and population figures may not be very accurate, at least it is very necessary and important to correct the names of administrative divisions. At the same time, with such an outline as a foundation, future repairs and patching will at least be less laborious than the initial arduous work. Moreover, the original book also stated that "this book will be published once a year," so it can be revised and corrected at any time in the future.

This book divides the national administrative regions into three categories. The first category is municipalities directly under the central government, with a total of twelve cities (Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin). The second category is provinces, divided into thirty-five provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Taiwan, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaoning, Andong, Liaobei, Jilin, Songjiang, Hejiang, Heilongjiang, Nen'an, Nenjiang). It has jurisdiction over 2016 counties; 57 cities under provincial jurisdiction; 40 governance bureaus; 1 management bureau; and 209 administrative inspectorates. The third category is local, which refers to Tibet.

Among the three categories, the second category is of course the most important. Under the province item, there are seven columns: 1. County and city numbers. 2. County and city names. 3. Old names of counties and cities, including a brief evolution. 4. Area. 5. The ratio of the national area to the province's area. 6. Population. 7. Remarks. The evolution section also briefly describes the original names and their jurisdiction, tracing back to the end of the Qing Dynasty. This is quite convenient for research. For example, on page 11, Wu County, Jiangsu Province, has: "The former capital of Suzhou Prefecture, in the first year of the Republic of China, the prefecture was abolished and the county was retained, and the two counties of Changzhou and Yuanhe were merged. In April of the first year, the two Ting of Taihu and Jinghu were also merged..." In addition, several newly established counties also have very simple and useful explanations. For example, Lihuang County in Anhui Province on page 24 (commemorating General Wei Lihuang's military exploits), and Jingfu County in Henan Province on page 130 (commemorating General Liu Zhi's military exploits), etc.

Regarding the numerical aspects, although they are not absolutely accurate, they are still a yardstick when there are no accurate statistics at present.

At the end of the book, there is also an index. As long as you remember the first character of the province, county, and city names, you can check the page number listed in the book according to the stroke count of the radical in the index. The printing and paper are satisfactory. However, in order to make this book more valuable and practical, the author has a few suggestions to ask the Ministry of Interior to adopt, namely (1) In terms of text, strive for popularization, so that ordinary people can understand it and become a common sense book that Chinese people should have. (2) It is best to attach a set of detailed maps to the book, to complement this book and increase the Chinese people's concept of the national territory. (3) The arrangement should be simplified a little to reduce the burden on readers.

### A New Interpretation of Forgiveness

— Feng Rixin

Confucius' lifelong philosophical foundation, according to Zengzi, is the two characters "loyalty and forgiveness," but the character "loyalty" has no specific explanation. The sentence in the Analects "The Master's way is loyalty and forgiveness, and nothing more" is followed by "What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others," which actually only explains the character "forgiveness," and the character "loyalty" is left empty. So, the most reliable annotation of Confucius' way is only the two sentences "What you do not wish."

However, recently I feel that these two sentences have problems. For example, today someone invites me to dinner. I am addicted to cigarettes, but the host is a comrade who quit smoking, or does not smoke at all and hates smoking. So, I have not been able to smoke (if I happen to forget to bring cigarettes). Isn't this suffering the loss of the host doing to me what he does not wish to be done to him? When it comes to eating, wine is inevitable. Even if the guests do not drink, the host will force them to drink, as if not getting the guests completely drunk is not a sign of respect. If it were possible to be so generous and polite about power, position, and wealth, that would be great, but unfortunately this can only be seen between the cups and tables, which really makes people suspect that the three hundred rituals and three thousand etiquettes of China are all about eating, drinking, dressing, and wearing, and have nothing to do with important matters.

Let's say that the wine is offered to you, and you encounter a stubborn host (I have seen people offering wine swear to guests: "If you don't drink this cup, I am a bastard," which shows how serious the problem is). Can you not sacrifice your own stomach to answer the host's kindness? According to this estimation, is the host being forgiving to the guest, or not? Someone in an article once complained about guessing games. When other people's spittle stars are flying around and fists are flying at your nose, if you are not one of them, where would you have time to appreciate the cries of "eight horses" and "nine connected lamps"? I am afraid that you would be more worried about the fish in the pond being affected by the fight. Then there is a difference in the view of wine. If it is good, then the loser should not be punished to drink, but the winner should drink freely; if it is not good, why give harmful things to guests? And force people to drink?

Here, forgiveness can be divided into two aspects: passive and active. "What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others" is passive, and "What you wish for yourself, do to others" is active. Passive forgiveness is certainly acceptable, but active forgiveness is very questionable. Zengzi only said "do not wish" and "do not do," but did not say "if you want to establish yourself, establish others, if you want to succeed, help others succeed." Or have the ancient sages already seen this? Passive forgiveness is inward-condensing, like an intransitive verb in grammar, whose action does not affect others—even its ultimate goal is not to interfere with others. The so-called not hindering the freedom of others is true freedom, which is an old tune, but it has a great truth. As for the active transitive style, we really dare not compliment it. Even the best and most reasonable things are not necessarily welcomed. For example, persuading prodigal sons not to smoke opium and not to indulge in prostitution and gambling often provokes rebuttals. And this time, the Shanghai Municipal Government banned dancing, which caused the glass and equipment of the Social Bureau to suffer greatly. All of these are examples.

However, the more advanced the culture, the more work belongs to active forgiveness, just as we cannot escape between heaven and earth once we are born into this world. The most deadly thing in this is of course the so-called advertising and propaganda. Not only do they deceive and confuse you in words and language, or increase your troubles, but they are also nagging and tireless in their methods. For example, the radio in the streets and neighbors has long been considered the most deadly thing. No matter which corner of the city you are in, you will encounter these troublesome opponents, and they will break in without opening the door or window, and preach to you, the stubborn stone that does not nod!

I often think that if human beings in the world completely eliminated the boundaries and organizations of race and country, there would be some major changes in moral concepts. Patriotic people in the past might become sinners of Datong [Great Harmony]. The reason is that their further interference is obviously 100% unreasonable from the perspective of pure freedom. Of course, this anarchist ideal is still too far from the real world, but if we are truly rational, we must admit that this realm will one day be realized. By that day, true forgiveness may come.

Recently, the major disease in politics is too much corruption. From my point of view, although most people are trapped in injustice due to the current difficult environment, it is also true that many people are misled by this kind of active forgiveness. For example, giving gifts during the New Year or openly bribing is completely based on the bribers' view of "who doesn't love money" to measure people's hearts. Lower-level officials are also like this to higher-level officials. On the one hand, they attack psychological weaknesses, and on the other hand, everyone gets into muddy water, so you don't have to be "untainted in the mud." Therefore, if forgiveness is universally implemented, it will definitely lead to a mess. The words of the saints must also be "viewed separately."

### Claiming Credit

—

A newly appointed police officer was eager to make some contributions and actually encountered an opportunity. It turned out that when he was on patrol, he encountered a robbery. He immediately reported to the police station by phone: "A man was robbed by another group of people, and I have caught one of them."

"Who is the person you arrested?" the police station asked him.

The answer on the phone was: "It's the man who was robbed."

### Father and Black Cat

— Bin Ru

I miss my father very much, because he passed away when I was eight years old. The biggest impression he gave me was only once: he was sleeping on a rattan couch, with a pale and thin face, and a five or six-inch-long beard under his chin. He stroked the black cat lying on his stomach with one hand, and played with his beard with the other, saying:

"Xiao Ying! Bounce the ball."

Xiao Ying was my nickname, so I bounced the ball. But after only three or four bounces, the ball lost control and jumped under the rattan couch. I bumped my head and fell beside the couch. My father laughed heartily and helped me up, holding my head and saying:

"Bouncing three times is already very good. Does it hurt?"

I was seven years old that year, and the next year, my father died.

After my father died, I especially liked that black cat, because I only remembered that it often slept on my father's body.

When I was ten years old, I was taken to Beijing by relatives to study for ten months. When I was eleven years old, I returned to my hometown. Even the black cat at home had died.

### Childlike Innocence

— Tong Tuo

Three-year-old Frolara has a bad temper. She doesn't want to eat during the day, but her appetite is very good after her parents go to bed at night. As a result, the child wakes up her parents with sharp cries, forcing them to feed her in bed, making their lives extremely abnormal and distressed. They tried to ignore her, beat her, and explain to her, but to no avail.

Frolara seems to like her little sister very much. Although her father is not a psychologist, he specially prepared a toy room for her. This toy room has no roof, and it contains small furniture and a complete set of dolls representing a family—one representing the father, one the mother, one the girl, and one the little sister.

At first, she put all four toy dolls on the bed, then picked up her little sister and patted the dolls to sleep. Then, she put the girl between the father doll and the mother doll, showing a satisfied smile.

The result is still a kind of jealousy. The girl represents herself, being able to sleep with her parents, while putting her little sister to sleep in another place. Frolara vents her anger in another form, and the result is making a lot of noise at night and wanting to eat.

If parents can study how children play, they can know most of their personalities—secrets of fear, hatred, love, doubt, jealousy, etc. According to psychologists, games are a mirror of young children's lives. They express the stories of their own world, revealing what they think and feel about their family, other children, and especially themselves.

For example, there is a child named Joan, who is seven years old this year. She was given psychological treatment because she was unhappy and troubled. She is easily angered and has no appetite. The psychologist sent her into a game room, and she immediately painted many rough pictures. One of them shows a house with the door closed and a little girl standing outside the door. There is also a tree and a locomotive. The psychologist knew her distress and began to ask:

"I don't know who the girl in the picture is?"

No answer.

"The child is too lonely, isn't she?"

Joan nodded in agreement.

"I think her name is Joan!"

"Yes—and that is her mother's house," the child said. At the same time, the psychologist knew that his question had touched the right line, so he knew her whole story: Joan's father was transferred to work in another place, and because there was no accommodation, he could not bring his family with him. One day, the child heard her mother chatting with a neighbor: "If it weren't for the child, I would have gone with my husband a long time ago."

Therefore, Joan felt that she had been abandoned and lost her parents' love. She had no room to vent her resentment, so she became unhappy and sick. When her mother knew what was troubling Joan, Joan's difficulties gradually eased and her life became normal.

Therefore, psychologists believe that games are not only of diagnostic value, but also an effective therapy for treating children's psychological disorders.

### Old Wine Stains

— Qian Lu

Recently, a cold wave came, and I felt very cold. For more than ten years, whenever it was cold, I would muddle-headedly put an old silk cotton robe on my body, but now it is so broken that I can no longer wear it. So, I searched the bottom of the box and found an old leather robe that had been forgotten for a long time. Although the Chen silk is like rotten grass, after some adjustments, it can barely cope with the situation. The wine stains on the front are still there, which are the symbols of the "Wuling Boy" era. More than ten years of life have been spent dealing with it, and there is no time to worry about clothes!

In the ten years of war, my family lost four people in a row due to the impact of prices. Medical expenses and funerals were fatal blows to my finances and spirit. In the past, I didn't have to worry about the seven things to start the day, but now it has become a problem, especially the tuition fees for two people, which are like a farmer looking up at the roof with a sigh, and there is no way to remedy it.

Since I was hit, I only felt cold, decadent, and not interested in life. My family advised me to continue to develop outwards, firstly to supplement the economy, and secondly to relieve my boredom. But I always felt that among relatives and friends, those who could maintain their old feelings had all been baptized by the "rise," and their situations were similar to mine. As for those who can be successful, I always feel that when they see me, they can't help but have a sense of the different past and present, and avoid me as if they are too slow. Therefore, I made up a crooked word, which is:

"People in troubled times add experience."

"The old business has been exhausted with the conquest!" Alas!

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 11: Full of Doubt (87)

Zhongjie strode into the bathroom and, glancing at the closet, slammed the door shut, rattling the glass bricks in the wall. Qifan found his behavior irritating and forced a smile, "Are you looking for a thief?" Zhongjie said, "Heh! Thief! I'm looking for the one who stole the flower." As he spoke, he nodded at Qifan, plopped down on the sofa, stretched out his legs, and stared intently at Qifan's face. Qifan paused, "Looking for the one who stole the flower? I don't understand what you mean." Zhongjie asked, "Are you truly ignorant, or feigning ignorance?" Qifan shook her head again. Zhongjie said, "Qifan! Since we've known each other, I haven't mistreated you, have I? I've agreed to everything you've asked. Now, because of you, I've received a major demerit, almost losing my position. You should know that." Qifan said, "Yes, you haven't mistreated me, and you've complied with my wishes in everything. I'm very grateful. But you said you were going to lose your position. That's not my fault, because I was passive." These words were already extremely polite and patient for Qifan, but Zhongjie's expression immediately changed, and he slammed the tea table with his hand, "What! You were passive? Then, I'm the one who harmed you!" Qifan pursed her lips and smiled slightly. Zhongjie nodded, "Good! I love you, but you don't love me, is that right?" Qifan found this question difficult to answer and continued to smile slightly. Zhongjie said, "That's not a problem. I love you. Whether you love me or not, I don't care. You're mine now. I don't mind taking the blame for you. Now, come with me!" Qifan asked in surprise, "Where are you telling me to go?" Zhongjie said, "You don't need to worry about that. Wherever I tell you to go, you go." Qifan said, "That's impossible. I have no need to go with you." Zhongjie slammed the tea table, "Now I've got you! You're admitting it yourself. You don't care for me. You're deceiving me! You're secretly favoring a young pretty boy. Others told me, but I didn't believe it. Now you've said it yourself!" Qifan was furious at Zhongjie's accusation of favoring a young pretty boy, and she trembled, "Director Miao, what do you mean by that? Please explain yourself clearly."

### Talking About Contradictions

— Yungong

Despite the existence of logic as a field of study in the world, and despite people emphasizing "rational" thinking, contradictory phenomena are still frequently seen.

Some people suffer from not being able to wake up early. They specifically bought an alarm clock, hoping it would wake them up on time. But one wasn't enough, so they bought a second one. The reason was that after the first alarm woke them up, they could still linger in bed, taking a nap until the second alarm rang. Their intention seemed to be to wake up early, but they also wanted to sleep a little longer, a little better. This is an example that we can easily understand.

Or, suppose you are a social worker and you go out in the morning without rain gear and it starts to rain. You want to hire a rickshaw from the racecourse to the Bund on Nanjing Road, a short distance, but the rickshaw driver charges you 50,000 yuan. From a compassionate standpoint, you can forgive him as a special case, but based on human nature, you tend to become disgusted with all rickshaw drivers. That's how contradictory the human heart is.

Indeed, examples of contradictions are everywhere. A friend told me that a legitimate businessman going abroad inevitably has incomplete documents and goes through a lot of trouble, while a spy's certificate of origin, nationality certificate, and passport may all be complete! Furthermore, one day I passed the 16th Pier by tram and saw a sign hanging outside a warehouse door that said, "No unauthorized personnel allowed," but the door was wide open, and there was a person who looked like an "unauthorized person" in tattered clothes, loitering there.

Probably as long as the world exists, contradictions will exist, and they will never be eliminated. Young people often yearn for lovers who are "impossible to be together." Airplanes and artillery are originally used for war, but the best strategy is to achieve a "victory without bloodshed" by "winning without fighting." A husband would rather abandon his virtuous wife and be fooled by a "pretty face" of a bad woman... This string of examples is endless, but this article must stop here.

### Vicissitudes of Changdian

— Qingxue Academy

Within the Culture City, there is a Culture Street, and within the Culture Street, there is a Culture Market. For half a month before the Lunar New Year every year, there is the so-called "Changdian Fair." The rise and fall, prosperity and decline of this fair reflect the changes of the times.

"Culture City" is Beijing, the ancient old capital, a political center for hundreds of years, where people seeking fame and fortune gather like "mountains rushing to Jingmen." The imperial examinations confined scholars from more than twenty provinces, and all related literature and art flowed here, becoming a cultural center. From the end of the Qing Dynasty when the imperial examinations were abolished, to the establishment of the Republic of China, the political form has changed many times, but in terms of culture, the old traditions are deep-rooted, and there are also many new developments. Even after the capital moved south to Nanjing in the seventeenth year of the Republic, and Beijing lost its political leadership position and the market gradually declined, the prestigious Peking University, the birthplace of the New Culture Movement, still existed. Moreover, the density of national, private, and major and minor schools far exceeded that of other cities in the north and south. Therefore, Nanjing was the political center, Shanghai was the economic center, and Beijing was the cultural center, forming a three-legged balance, which is generally accurate.

"Culture Street" is Liulichang, located south of the big city, west of Zhengyangmen, and east of Xuanwumen, and just at the Hepingmen opened in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China. Xinhua Street outside Hepingmen runs from north to south, and Liulichang is more than a mile long from east to west, forming a cross intersection with Xinhua Street. This place also has a quaint name called "Haiwang Village," with historical traces from two or three dynasties, which does not need to be described in detail in this article. Since the Republic of China, the streets have been widened, the city appearance has been improved, and a "Haiwang Village Park" has been built on the east side of the cross street, which is much larger than before in form. The shops on this street are lined up, mostly bookstores, calligraphy and painting shops, antique shops, brush shops, ink shops, and stationery stores. Most of the shopkeepers and clerks can talk about literature, textual research, epigraphy, and editions, and they talk about it with great interest. In the past, elegant officials, gentry, celebrities, and scholars lingered here, which was a good thing. There are many shops selling cultural goods, books, and paintings in various streets of the nine cities, with Liulichang as the representative. The prices of goods are also more expensive than those in the inner city shops. In addition to the old-fashioned bookstores, major Shanghai bookstores such as "Commercial Press," "China Bookstore," and "Yu Zheng" (the Yu Zheng branch closed seven years ago) are all located on the west side of the cross street, facing each other. Therefore, it is also a meeting and concentration place for the north and south book industries. In the past imperial examination era, it occupied an absolute advantage. Later, schools flourished, and it also maintained contact with the education sector. It is not an exaggeration to call it "Culture Street."

"Culture Market" is the Vulcan Temple north of Laitou Road on Culture Street. Although the temple base is not large, the architecture is quite clean and tidy, with three courtyards inside and outside. The front and back courtyards each have a main hall and side rooms with corridors, and the last layer is all north rooms. Each courtyard also has alleys that can be connected. The temple is opened on the evening of the fourth day of the first lunar month every year, and the fifth to seventh days are the official days for the Vulcan incense offering. At the same time, jade shops, ivory shops, red goods shops, and various antique shops of gold, stone, porcelain, and copper from all cities come there to rent rooms or set up stalls and display their goods, all using exquisite "treasure shelves," full of jewels and strange lights. The merchants and shop assistants who greet the guests are all neatly dressed and calm, and they can also speak a few foreign words. The customers are prominent officials, wealthy gentry, wives, concubines, young ladies, young mistresses, "foreign masters," and "foreign ladies." They are unwilling to stroll around the street fair but prefer to go to the temple with carriages and servants because they have money, so the business is particularly generous. There is a public notice of "Culture Market" outside the door, but it can actually be called "Aristocratic Market."

The business of this temple was in its "golden age" from the second or third year of the Republic of China to the eighth or ninth year. Because after the revolution, the former Qing nobles and prominent officials either lost their jobs or moved to Tianjin and Qingdao, and a large number of treasures from their residences were sold off and collected by antique dealers. In the early Republic of China, wealthy warlords and wealthy capitalists imitated elegance and collected antiques for display. Foreign masters and Madams from foreign firms in Dongjiaominxiang also loved Chinese curios, buying them themselves and sending them back to their countries in large quantities. As a result, every January, the cars at the east gate of Changdian were like clouds, crowding the street so tightly that even wind and rain could not pass through. Merchants' wealth flowed in, not only was the decline of the old capital in the past twenty years unbearable to look back on, but even in the former Qing Dynasty there was no such special prosperity.

As the old saying goes, "The roaring one will be cut off, and the blazing one will be extinguished." Prosperity leads to decline, which is also a common principle. Since the tenth year of the Republic, large loans have long been exhausted, valuable and good things have been bought up, and wealthy customers have become fewer. In the seventeenth year, the capital moved to Jinling, and Chinese and foreign dignitaries and elegant people flocked south. The old capital's industries declined year by year, especially "Culture Street," and even more so since the Japanese invasion.

The Vulcan Temple is also called the "East Temple" because it is east of the cross street, while the Land Temple facing Haiyu Village on the west side of the street is the "West Temple." The East Temple mainly deals in precious jewels and jade, with calligraphy and painting as secondary; the West Temple mainly deals in books and inscriptions, with other antiques as auxiliary. The East Temple's biggest business is with "foreign firms," followed by wealthy and rich people. During the occupation, Westerners left in large numbers, and many short Japanese came, but the Japanese were known for being "stingy." Moreover, during the war, they focused on practical materials, and antiques were really "out of stock." Therefore, in these eight years, the number of stalls in the East Temple decreased day by day, and only two or three out of ten made money. On the Chinese side, the pseudo-"finance ministers" (surnamed Wang) had money and were really willing to spend it, playing with and collecting everything, especially chicken blood stones, Tian Huang stones, and famous seals. They bought with no regard for price, and selected only the best. Merchants regarded them as gods of wealth. In addition, "Wang Huzi," "Wang Xiazi," and "Wang Haizi" (all leaders of the pseudo-committees) also had their own preferences, but compared to the thousands of wealthy families of the old aristocracy, they were at the end of their rope. Only three or five merchants made "pseudo" fortunes, while the rest mostly closed down or changed careers. Since the victory, in terms of foreign firms, all merchants have been eagerly looking forward to "Big Old America," but the "Old Americans" who came to Beijing after the war were mostly soldiers with limited money. In the past year, they have been transferred away from Beijing, so how many foreign customers are left? In the entire Changdian, they are truly as rare as morning stars. Many important Chinese figures are busy with military affairs, and North China is now "surrounded by enemies on all sides." Food and daily necessities have risen in price, and most floating capital is focused on real needs, so precious goods have naturally been affected. The Vulcan Temple is even more filled with endless desolation!

The "West Temple" (Land Temple) was full of book stalls like a forest more than a decade ago, piled up like mountains, but now not a single stall can be seen, it is empty. Only a few are scattered outside the temple, leaning against the street wall. Eight or nine out of ten old bookstores in Liulichang are closed. Thread-bound rare books are mostly sold by the pound as waste paper for papermaking materials, so what else is there to say! Although the government has made a good deed of allocating huge sums of money to buy old books and preserve culture, this is not a "relief" issue that can be solved in a short time, so the old book industry is always pessimistic.

Social Services, Reader Consultations, Legal Clarifications

### Holding Ten Thousand Shares, Similar to Waste Paper, Business Downturn, Declared Liquidation, Small Shareholders Suffer from Company Liquidation

Fan Yun asked: I previously acquired 10,000 shares of a certain company from a friend. The directors of the company are all financial tycoons in Shanghai. Recently, when I went to transfer the shares, I was refused. They claimed the company was about to dissolve and there was no need to transfer the shares. They would return the share money or exchange them for shares of the Kunshan Electric Factory owned by the company. I asked to exchange for the electric factory shares. One month later, when I went again, they returned the original shares, saying that the electric factory shares had already been exchanged by a major shareholder. They asked me to wait until the liquidation was completed and the share money would be returned. Half a month later, when I went again, the place had been transferred to someone else and I don't know where they moved. Now I have several questions and would be grateful if you could answer them: (1) Is it legal for the company to dissolve and liquidate without the approval of a shareholders' meeting? (2) Does the company have the right to dispose of company assets (such as all stocks, offices, etc.)? (3) Do major shareholders have any priority rights? (4) Can shareholders sue for embezzlement in court based on the company's deliberate delays? (5) If other shareholders file a lawsuit together, who should be the target? (6) Can I entrust a friend to represent me since I am currently out of town?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan's Answer] (1) If the company has legally obtained the status of a company under the Company Law, its dissolution and liquidation should be approved by a shareholders' meeting. (2) The person in charge of the company has the right to dispose of all company assets during liquidation. (3) Major shareholders do not have priority rights. (4) You should first take the shares to demand payment. Otherwise, you can pursue compensation in court. If embezzlement is discovered, you can also file a criminal lawsuit. (5) The person in charge of the company is the target. (6) You can entrust a friend to handle it.

### Job Openings

(1) A certain plumbing and electrical shop is hiring a male accountant who can also draw blueprints. (2) A certain public middle school in the suburbs of Shanghai is hiring a male (around 40 years old) high school physics teacher. (3) A certain factory in the suburbs is hiring a diesel boat driver and repairman. (4) A certain gentleman in Nanshi is hiring a male high school tutor for Chinese, English, math, physics, and chemistry.

### Telecommunications Q&A, Answered by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

(Wang Jinlong of Maigen Road asks) What is a special telegram? What are its types and characteristics?

(Answer) Special telegrams are special uses of telegram services, divided into various types of telegrams such as verification, distribution, special delivery, forwarding, delivery in person, retransmission, prepaid reply fee, and notification of delivery. "Verification telegram": If the sender wants to ensure the accuracy of the telegram sent, they can ask the telecommunications bureau to retransmit the telegram for verification. "Distribution telegram": This is applicable if the sender wants to request the telecommunications bureau to distribute the telegram to more than two residences at the same destination. "Special delivery telegram": If the recipient lives outside the delivery area of the receiving telegraph office and the sender wants the telegram to reach its destination quickly, they can ask the receiving office to send a special messenger to deliver it. "Forwarding telegram": If the sender is afraid that the recipient may have left or has no fixed address when the telegram arrives at its destination, they can request to send a forwarding telegram. "Held for arrival telegram": If the sender is afraid that the recipient has not yet arrived at the receiving telegraph office or has left when the telegram arrives at its destination, the sender can have the telegram temporarily held at the receiving telegraph office or post office, waiting for the recipient to pick it up.
