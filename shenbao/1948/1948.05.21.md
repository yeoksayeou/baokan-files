### Full Text of President Chiang’s Address: Seizing the Opportunity to Urge Reform of All Government Affairs, Shortening the Calamity of War and Realizing Unified Peace

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The full text of President Chiang's inaugural address on the 20th is as follows:

I, Zhongzheng, was elected President of the Republic of China by the National Assembly in accordance with the Constitution, to undertake the public duty to the nation and the people. At this beginning of my term, recalling the hardships faced by our Founding Father and revolutionary martyrs in establishing the Republic, reflecting on the environment in which our nation and people find themselves, and considering the expectations of all our compatriots, I deeply feel that the responsibility is great and the burden is heavy. Since dedicating myself to national affairs, I have always known that loyalty and service are my inherent duties. Today, accepting this position is not what I originally intended. Over the past twenty years, internal troubles and external threats have followed one after another. Due to the long-term War of Resistance and the suppression of the rebellion, the goal of national construction has not been achieved, for which I feel deeply ashamed. From now on, our entire nation must not only build democracy during the suppression of the rebellion but also seek construction and progress through the suppression of the rebellion. This great cause of saving the country cannot be accomplished by one person alone, nor can it be achieved in a short period of time. Having been entrusted with this responsibility by the people, I hope that the people will give me their assistance. With utmost sincerity, I would like to inform all my compatriots of the needs of the country and the direction of joint efforts between the government and the people. Implementing constitutional governance is an unprecedented event in the Republic of China. We have endured countless sacrifices, difficulties, and setbacks to complete the process of implementing constitutional governance today. This is the result of a long-term struggle, the glorious achievement of our revolutionary war of resistance over fifty years, and the crystallization of the blood and sweat of all our military and civilians. We must cherish this hard-won achievement. Every individual has a sacred responsibility. Constitutional governance is for the future of the country and for the welfare of the people. If the country cannot achieve unity, independence, and prosperity through constitutional governance, and if the people cannot obtain happiness and progress through constitutional governance, then constitutional governance will lose its meaning. After the implementation of constitutional governance, the first priority is to ensure that the Constitution is not merely words but is put into practice. Therefore, strict adherence to this Constitution is the responsibility of the constitutional government and the duty of every compatriot in the country. The sovereignty of the state rests with all the people, and the responsibility for saving and building the nation also rests with all the people. At the beginning of constitutional governance, all citizens must fulfill their responsibilities, abide by the law, have a spirit of public service, and cultivate the habit of putting public interests before private interests to achieve the purpose of this constitutional governance. We must respect the Constitution, implement the Constitution, and establish the foundation of the rule of law. At the same time, all citizens must understand the true meaning of democracy and learn towards genuine democracy. It must be understood that a democratic system is a way of life, manifested not only in politics but also in economic, social, and various professional activities. Citizens of a democratic country will never give up their rights or shirk their duties. Democracy requires the minority to submit to the majority, but it is never the case that the majority oppresses the minority, and it is even less permissible for the minority to hold the majority hostage. Every citizen must have self-respect, the opportunity to express fair opinions, and the spirit to accept criticism and sacrifice their own interests. I will lead by example, wholeheartedly uphold the Constitution, abide by the Constitution, cultivate our democratic habits, and guide our country towards the true path of democracy. At the beginning of this constitutional governance, my colleagues in the government and I will strictly abide by the scope stipulated by the Constitution, perform the duties conferred by the Constitution, and lay a permanent and unshakable foundation for China's democracy.

The only effective way to eliminate the communists is to reform politics, economy, and society.

The main purpose of the Constitution of the Republic of China is to "consolidate national sovereignty and protect civil rights." The greatest needs of the country at present are unity, freedom, and progress. The communists, who resort to arms and betray the country and disrupt social order, are obstacles to national unity and enemies of freedom and progress. We must gather the strength of the entire nation to thoroughly eliminate these anti-democratic and destructive evil forces. After the establishment of the constitutional government, we must further consolidate the military and strengthen military affairs, quell the rebellion in the short term, so that compatriots in the communist-occupied areas can be relieved of their suffering, and the survival of the nation and its historical culture will not be threatened. At the same time, we must ensure that all measures in the political, economic, educational, and social aspects of the country are coordinated with the military suppression of the rebellion. Today's military suppression of the rebellion is by no means a matter of party factionalism, nor is it a matter of gains and losses, but a war of national salvation and self-preservation between democracy and totalitarianism, unity and division, patriotism and harming the country, humanity and brutality, survival and destruction. Today is truly a critical juncture for the survival and continuation of the nation and its people. I, Zhongzheng, have been entrusted with this responsibility at a time of crisis. Personal success or failure, joy or sorrow, have long been put aside. I will devote myself wholeheartedly to achieving my lifelong ambition of serving and saving the country. I firmly believe that the conscious and spontaneous power of the people of the whole country is the strongest force for eliminating the communists, and only comprehensive reform in politics, economy, and society is the most effective way to eliminate the communists. In order to safeguard the foundation of the Republic of China and protect the happiness of the people, I earnestly call on all patriotic compatriots who love freedom to rise up in a timely manner, unite under the Three Principles of the People and the Constitution, concentrate their will, contribute their strength, complete the task of suppressing the rebellion, shorten the disasters of war, restore normal order, and realize national unity and peace.

To rectify officialdom and establish discipline, protect the legitimate rights of the people

The nation is bearing the aftermath of the eight-year War of Resistance, and the poison left by the enemy and puppet regimes has not yet been eliminated. The communist conspiracy suddenly expanded, causing the original plans for restoration, reconstruction, and post-war rehabilitation to be hindered, which affected society and then the economy, the economy affected politics, and politics affected the people's livelihood. The severity of the national situation today cannot be denied, and the various shortcomings in politics and society are also undeniable. These serious shortcomings must be reformed quickly, which is beyond doubt. However, the most effective reforms must be carried out through systems and laws, must meet the requirements of the majority of the people, and must be implemented in a step-by-step and planned manner, distinguishing between the fundamentals and the details, and the important and the less important. After our implementation of constitutional governance, the system has been reformed, and the relationship between the government and the people is closer. Since I personally bear the solemn trust of the people, I must seize this opportunity for renewal with the greatest sincerity and determination, and urge our government to begin reforming all government affairs. I believe that the main tasks of the new government must be to rectify officialdom, establish discipline, eradicate all acts of seeking private gain in office, appoint virtuous and capable people to renew personnel, improve the efficiency of administration at all levels, strictly implement assessments, clarify rewards and punishments, diligently seek out the people's concerns, eliminate hypocrisy and procrastination in the government style, reduce the extra-legal levies imposed on the local people, simplify laws and regulations, clarify powers and responsibilities, unify the implementing agencies, and eliminate complex and impractical laws. In short, it is necessary to enhance the dignity of the law, protect legitimate rights, ensure that everyone is equal before the law, and that the people have equal opportunities to fulfill their civic obligations and develop their personal abilities.

The main direction of economic measures is to stabilize prices and enrich the people's livelihood

In terms of economic measures, we must implement the Three Principles of the People. The provisions of our new Constitution on basic national policies related to the national economy and social security are based on the teachings of the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father. Today, we do not need to seek other paths. After the establishment of the new government, my colleagues in the government and I must do our best to follow this goal. In terms of symptomatic treatment, we must use effective methods to stabilize the currency value, balance income and expenditure, manage finance, and improve transportation so that prices tend to stabilize and the people can avoid poverty. In terms of fundamental treatment, we must be practical and realistic in promoting land reform, protecting the interests of tenant farmers, promoting agricultural land loans to equalize land ownership, using progressive tax rates to levy excessive profits, and cracking down on speculation and profiteering to control capital. At the same time, we must promote cooperative enterprises, promote agricultural and industrial production, protect legal trade, and welcome international investment to increase the quantity of materials and enrich the people's lives. We have always regarded political freedom and economic equality as the inherent goals of the Three Principles of the People. The first thing the new government must do after its establishment is to use appropriate and practical plans and concrete steps to achieve this goal. In short, we believe that the interests of the country lie in the interests of the people themselves, and the interests of the people must be based on the interests of the majority of the people. This is the main direction of the new government's domestic measures.

### President Chiang Practices Thrift: Old Clothes Recycled into Formal Attire; Capital City Displays a New Look with Thunderous Cheers

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] This morning, when the President and Vice President held the oath-taking ceremony, they did not wear the formal attire that was completed the night before the inauguration, which contradicted the expectations of some attendees in recent days. The President wore a blue robe with a black jacket, with a large red sash, on which was pinned a Kuomintang (Blue Sky, White Sun) medal. The Vice President wore a military uniform with six medals on his chest, standing to the left rear, one civilian and one military, one in front and one behind. During the ceremony, when bowing to the national flag and the Founding Father, the President turned around, and the Vice President, like an attendant accompanying the groom, closely followed the President to his left side, observing etiquette very carefully. The oath administrator was the white-haired and white-bearded Wu Zhiren, standing to the left rear of the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father, wearing a lake-gray silk jacket with large floral patterns. Wu Siyu, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies, wore a military uniform with medals on his chest, standing on the left side of the stage alongside Wu Dingchang, Secretary-General of the State Council in a Western-style tailcoat. Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, also wore a Western-style formal suit, representing the National Assembly standing on the right front side. After the President raised his right hand and recited the oath facing the national flag and the Founding Father, he handed the oath book in a red envelope to the oath administrator, then to Wu Zhiren, and then transferred it to Hong Lanyou, for the National Assembly to preserve this valuable historical document. In today's ceremony, the Vice President only took his place and did not take an oath, standing to the rear side when the President took the oath and delivered his address. After the ceremony was completed, the attendees stood up together, and the applause lasted for a long time before subsiding. The President shook hands with the Vice President and the oath administrator amidst the cheers, then turned back and nodded with a smile, his joy overflowing. Then he slowly withdrew from the stage. It is reported that the formal attire of the President and Vice President has been made. The President's formal attire was specially remade by a clothing company in the capital from an existing Marshal's uniform, costing about 80 to 90 million yuan. In order to practice thrift, the President did not remake new formal attire but only modified the original Chairman's formal attire in two places: first, the four gold stars on the original shoulder boards of the Generalissimo of the Navy, Army, and Air Force were changed to five stars; second, the three gold rings on the sleeves were changed to five gold plum blossoms. The Vice President's formal attire was also made by the same clothing company, with the same material and style as the President's. The only differences were the four gold stars on the shoulder boards of the Army and the four gold plum blossoms on the sleeves. It is said that the cost of the Vice President's formal attire was over 400 million yuan.

Foreign Envoys Dress Differently; Papal Nuncio Wears All Red

Egyptian Minister Wears a Red Hat

The formal attire of diplomatic envoys varied. In the Americas, except for a few Spanish-speaking countries, they all wore evening dress and medals. This simple dress is a new trend in modern diplomatic society. However, in Europe, especially Western and Northern Europe, the style of the Middle Ages was still strong. Each wore a black formal dress with gold embroidery and large flowers, with brilliant epaulets, sashes, and swords. A hat with a black velvet trim was tucked under their arms. The formal attire of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe still had some of the old etiquette on their shoulders and chests. Envoys from Islamic countries and Spanish-speaking Central and South American countries wore a lot of scarlet. The Egyptian Minister and the Turkish Charge d'Affaires both wore a red hat that they never took off. The Dominican Minister wore a bright red coat. But the most eye-catching was the Papal Nuncio, who was red from head to toe, with a large gold cross on his chest and a red cassock on the outside.

Madame Chiang Passes Through Foreign Dignitaries' Section; Envoys Stand to Pay Respects

Two Sons of President Chiang Attend the Ceremony

At about 10 o'clock, Madame Chiang and Madame Vice President appeared at the side door of the main platform and walked down the main platform under the guidance of attendants, and sat in the seats of the fearful officials. Madame Chiang wore a long cheongsam dress of dark treasure color embroidered with the words "blessing and longevity," with a narrow border of white embroidered flowers. Madame Li wore a long cheongsam dress of black satin with a wide border of plum blossoms and the word "longevity." They both wore a black woolen overcoat. When passing in front of the seats of the envoys and foreign dignitaries, they all stood up to pay their respects, and the ladies returned the greeting with a smile.

The two sons of President Chiang, Chiang Ching-kuo and Chiang Wei-kuo, also attended the ceremony. Ching-kuo wore the navy blue Zhongshan suit he wears every day, and Wei-kuo wore a crisp vermilion gabardine military uniform.

### Nominee for Premier: Presidential Decree May Be Issued; Zhang Qun and He Yingqin Are Both Highly Touted

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] After the President's inauguration on the 20th, his first task is to nominate a candidate for Premier, seek the approval of the Legislative Yuan, and form the new Cabinet. However, as of midnight on the 20th, the candidate had not yet been nominated. It is reported that the President had previously consulted with Zhang Qun to form a new cabinet, but Zhang's intention to decline was very firm, so the President reconsidered other candidates. It is said that the President's intention to invite Zhang Qun to form a cabinet has not been dismissed, and at the same time, he is considering inviting He Yingqin to serve as the new Premier. Sources believe that the new Premier may be selected from either Zhang or He, and formally nominated on the afternoon of the 21st.

[Another Dispatch] After the Legislative Yuan passed the rules of procedure on the afternoon of the 20th, the initial stage of the meeting has come to an end. The President's inauguration has made the approval of the Premier the most important task of the Yuan at present. The Yuan will decide to hold a plenary committee meeting immediately after receiving the President's letter requesting approval of the Premier candidate. The time will be the afternoon of the 22nd or the morning of the 22nd. The plenary review meeting will also decide whether it is necessary to request the President to notify the nominated person to present their policy views. (Opinions of 20 legislators on the Premier are published on page two)

### Foreign Policy of the New Government

Regarding the foreign policy of the new government, I would like to explain it in three parts:

First, regarding the organization of the United Nations, the first responsibility of the new government in terms of foreign policy is to maintain and strengthen the power of the United Nations. Article 141 of the Constitution of the Republic of China has clear provisions regarding our country's responsibilities to the United Nations. The ideal of our sacrifice in resisting the Axis countries for eight years of the War of Resistance is that the United Nations has not yet become a powerful organization for maintaining world peace, which is undeniable. Many people, in view of the many difficulties and setbacks encountered by this organization in the past two years, have come to doubt its future destiny and its existence. We will never allow the existence of this widespread skepticism to shake our beliefs. On the contrary, precisely because there is such doubt, we should increase our efforts to maintain and strengthen the organization of the United Nations. As far as China is concerned, we can say that we did not bear the main responsibility for the failure of the former League of Nations, but for the success or failure of the United Nations, we have a common responsibility to humanity and to history that cannot be avoided, because China is one of the founding members of this organization and a permanent member of the Security Council.

Second, regarding general international cooperation, after the surrender of Germany and Japan, the relations between the Allied countries gradually shifted from a kind of cooperation to widespread suspicion, which is what we Chinese people are most worried about. But China's policy has always been one of peace and cooperation. We will never lightly regard the needs of world peace, prosperity, and progress from the perspective of the interests of one country alone. In terms of economy, we are an industrially and commercially backward country, but we do not therefore refuse to participate in international trade and tariff agreements. In terms of politics, we are a country with unrestrained internal strife and backward education, but we do not therefore delay our participation in social and cultural international cooperation work such as freedom of the press conferences. We believe that the highest ideal of international relations after the war is peace and cooperation. The interaction between our people and overseas Chinese and the people of friendly countries must be based on the spirit of equality and mutual benefit, and strive to increase mutual friendship and respect mutual status. As for the economic revival of China, it certainly needs international assistance, but we deeply realize that only by vigorously promoting self-reliance can international assistance generate real effectiveness. After the establishment of the new government, we must continue our established international cooperation policy, and at the same time, we must earnestly implement self-reliance.

Third, regarding the attitude towards peace treaties, when Japan surrendered, I once said that China would never adopt a policy of revenge against Japan. I believe that whether it is against Germany or Japan, the United Nations should adopt this broad policy with a firm and unified attitude. Generosity is by no means a sign of weakness. On the contrary, reasonable generosity is an effective way to achieve our lofty ideals. Regarding the policy towards Japan, we believe that two points must be noted: (1) The Allied countries must make the greatest efforts to assist the growth of genuine democratic forces in Japan, so that Japan's political system, social system, and people's thinking can be genuinely transformed to eradicate the revival of militarism. Whether our broad policy can succeed depends entirely on whether our efforts are earnest and successful. (2) China does not have any excessive demands on Japan, but China is a country that has been severely invaded by Japan and has resisted for more than eight years. When deciding on the peace terms with Japan, it cannot but require other Allied countries to recognize that our country should have a special status in the peace conference. The above three major points are our main foreign policy directions. In short, we must be self-reliant domestically and cooperate equally externally. Our government must strive to contribute to world justice and peace.

I, Zhongzheng, am taking office today at a time when domestic rebellion has not been quelled and the economy is turbulent, and also at a time when world peace has not yet been firmly established. Reflecting on my responsibilities and observing the environment, I do not deny that our China is full of troubles, and I do not deny that our future of national construction is very difficult. The basic conditions for democracy are still weak. But the force of the times has made us take a big step forward on the path of democratic constitutional politics. Despite the turbulent waves that lie ahead, our determination to move forward cannot be hindered by any difficulties. I have worked hard for national affairs for forty years, and I am convinced that the Founding Father’s words "Everything that conforms to Heaven's principles, accords with the people's hearts, is in line with the world's trends and the needs of the people, and is determined to be done by the wise and enlightened, will be accomplished" is indeed an accurate and unswerving truth. Therefore, I am willing to accept this sacred mission of saving and building the country and realizing democracy with sincere and firm confidence together with my compatriots and colleagues in the government. I hope that all the talented people and military and civilian compatriots of the country will work together with one heart and one mind, each doing their best and each fulfilling their duties. I especially hope that they will point out my mistakes and give me good advice, help and support each other, and lay a good foundation for the unification, independence, freedom, and equality of the Republic of China. I, Zhongzheng, must take the will of the people as my will and the interests of the country as my interests, broadly solicit opinions, and faithfully perform my duties, so that our mission of constitutional governance and national construction will achieve complete success. (The End)

### Passage of the Rules of Procedure by the Legislative Yuan

[Our Nanjing Office, 20th] The Legislative Yuan convened its second meeting of the first session at 3:30 PM on the 20th. President Sun chaired the meeting, and after approving the minutes of the previous meeting, continued to discuss the draft rules of procedure. The first seven chapters had already been amended and approved during the first meeting. Beginning with the eighth chapter, Liu Bolan, Wu Hexuan, and others believed there were many objections to the eighth chapter and advocated for temporarily shelving it and starting with the ninth chapter. Chen Jiesheng and others expressed their opposition. Peng Erkang and Zhang Daofan pointed out that the discussions were excessive and lacked new ideas, advocating for the four motions proposed by the drafting committee to be put to a vote in order. Such trivial arguments led to shouts for a halt to speeches. President Sun then requested that the four motions, A, B, C, and D of the eighth chapter, be put to a vote in order. At that time, there were 505 members present. After motion A was rejected with a small minority of 94 votes, motion B surprisingly received 306 votes in favor and was passed. Motions C and D were no longer put to a vote. At 4:50 PM, amidst applause, the articles were re-read. Only Jiang Yiping proposed a textual revision to Article 55, while the rest were passed in their original form. At this point, the method of exercising the power of consent was determined to be that the Legislative Yuan's plenary committee would review it first, and then submit it to the plenary session for a secret ballot. The plenary committee would have a chairman elected by the members, and if the plenary committee deemed it necessary, it could request the President to notify the nominee to present their policy views up to three times. The original text of Article 57, paragraph 1 of the ninth chapter stated: "The Premier of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various ministries of the Executive Yuan shall submit a statement of administrative policies and an administrative report to the meeting of this Yuan at the beginning of each session or at the beginning of their term of office." In addition to adding the phrase "in accordance with the provisions of Article 57, paragraph 1 of the Constitution," the time limit for the report was removed. This was because, in the spirit of the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan should be able to hear reports from the Executive Yuan and raise questions at any time. This amendment was mentioned by Jian Guansan at the meeting on the 18th, and now President Sun put forward a concrete proposal, which avoided the original article's self-imposed limitations and won applause from the entire audience. The original text of Article 62 stated: "Questions shall not be refused except for preserving national defense secrets or matters related to international covenants." However, after Sun Guiji and others stated that the phrase "international covenants" was ambiguous and easily misunderstood, the entire article was revised to: "Questions shall not be refused except for preserving national defense and foreign affairs secrets." Chapter 10, "Reconsideration," and Chapter 11, "Minutes," were passed smoothly. In Chapter 12, "Order," Article 71, "Members who leave the meeting early shall not affect the calculation of the legal quorum for the meeting," was amended to "Members who leave the meeting early shall not affect the proceedings of the meeting." Another article, "Members who have been impeached shall have the right to defend themselves before a decision is made by the meeting of this Yuan," was deleted as unnecessary. Chapter 13, "Meetings of Various Committees," and Chapter 14, "Supplementary Provisions," were also passed smoothly. The draft rules of procedure (the full text, after deletions and revisions, remained at 79 articles) was thus concluded, and it was already past 6:00 PM. The second item for discussion was the proposal by Tian Yushi and others to amend Article 19 of the Organic Law of the Yuan, arguing that the appointment of the Secretary-General of the Yuan should still be proposed by the President of the Yuan and decided by the meeting of the Yuan. Due to lack of time, it was not discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM.

Editorial

### An Interlude in the U.S.-Soviet Detente Attempt

At a time when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were engaged in a heated Cold War in many parts of the world, Moscow suddenly released documents exchanged between Smith and Molotov, in which both sides stated their desire to improve U.S.-Soviet relations and resolve all disputes between the two countries through direct negotiations. As soon as this news was released, it caused a sensation around the world. People believed that the troubled world was unfolding a vision of "light at the end of the tunnel." However, Moscow's release of these documents without prior agreement from the United States suggested that the Soviet Union had ulterior motives. Furthermore, a close reading of the documents exchanged between Smith and Molotov revealed that the U.S. and the Soviet Union still had diametrically opposed viewpoints on the issues in dispute, and the distance between them remained. Subsequently, President Truman issued a corrective statement, Smith sent another letter to Molotov, and Secretary of State Marshall also solemnly declared that the United States had no intention of negotiating with the Soviet Union alone. Thus, the series of illusions sparked by the exchange of documents between the U.S. and the Soviet Union reverted to bubbles.

However, in this attempt at peace, a subtle interlude occurred, namely the letter from Wallace, the leader of the U.S. opposition party, the Third Party, to Stalin. This "open letter" was published on the 13th. He called for immediate action by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to stop the "Cold War" and advocated for convening a public conference to establish a peace plan for the next century. Finally, he put forward a concrete plan for a peaceful resolution of U.S.-Soviet differences, suggesting that the U.S. and the Soviet Union take the following steps to end the "Cold War" in various parts of the world: (1) General disarmament and banning of atomic weapons; (2) Conclusion of peace treaties with Japan and Germany, and withdrawal of troops from both countries; (3) Withdrawal of troops from China and Korea; (4) Respect for the sovereignty of all countries and non-interference in their internal affairs; (5) Prohibition of the establishment of military bases within the territory of United Nations member states; (6) Development of international trade by all possible means and elimination of all discriminatory measures; (7) Assistance to war-torn countries in economic recovery within the framework of the United Nations; (8) Maintenance of democracy and protection of civil rights in all countries of the world; (9) Citizens, students, and journalists of the U.S. and the Soviet Union should be able to move freely within each other's countries, and the free exchange of scientific information between the two countries should be restored. …

These many proposals are the personal opinions of Wallace, the leader of the U.S. opposition party, and are not worth overemphasizing. However, Stalin suddenly broke his usual habit and published a reply on the 17th, responding directly to Wallace's suggestions. He said that Ambassador Smith's letter only expressed the U.S.'s desire to resolve U.S.-Soviet differences, but did not provide any further plans. However, Wallace's open letter provided a concrete plan for a peaceful resolution of U.S.-Soviet differences, which could serve as a basis for U.S.-Soviet cooperation. Finally, Stalin struck a pose of Soviet pursuit of peace, saying: "As far as the Soviet government is concerned, it believes that Wallace's plan can serve as a good and effective basis for achieving U.S.-Soviet coordination and promoting the development of international cooperation. Because the government believes, despite the differences in economic systems and ideologies, that the coexistence of these systems and the peaceful resolution of U.S.-Soviet differences are not only possible; but also absolutely necessary for the sake of universal peace."

Regardless of Wallace's suggestions, Stalin's praise of Wallace is unprecedented in normal diplomacy. But why did Stalin praise Wallace? Anyone with discerning eyes can see that there are two main purposes: First, the Soviet Union's peace offensive. Stalin's reply to Wallace directly stated that the Soviet Union wants peace and is willing to negotiate peacefully with the United States to resolve the problem; indirectly shifting the responsibility for the failure of this peace negotiation entirely to the United States. Second, it is a powerful boost to Wallace's campaign for president as the leader of the Third Party in the United States, so that the American people who hope to follow a peaceful path and eliminate all disputes between the U.S. and the Soviet Union through negotiations to avoid a bloody war will support Wallace's presidential campaign.

But can Stalin's two major goals be fully realized? We must seek answers from Wallace's proposals. The main points of Wallace's concrete plan are as described above. In theory, they are indeed very moving. If this can be the basis for U.S.-Soviet negotiations, and can lead to U.S.-Soviet coordination, not to mention that the American people will fully support it, even the U.S. government will be optimistic about it. The motivation for Ambassador Smith's letter to Molotov was to test whether the Soviet Union was sincere about peace talks. Unexpectedly, although Molotov was also willing to negotiate directly with the United States, the Soviet Union's views were still diametrically opposed to those of the United States, and there was absolutely no room for compromise. Therefore, the United States had to abandon its plan for direct negotiations and change its position to demand that the Soviet Union resolve all international outstanding issues through the United Nations framework. In order to launch a peace offensive from the side, the Soviet Union abandoned the diplomatic route and sought another way, with Stalin replying to Wallace. However, the eyes of the world are discerning. In the two or three years after the war, who truly loves peace? Who is obstructing peace? It is clear at a glance. The past facts are truly too numerous to mention, and we are unwilling to repeat the old stories. Even with regard to the points raised by Wallace, they actually do not touch the core of U.S.-Soviet relations; and these issues are what the U.S. diplomatic authorities have been seeking to resolve, but because of the differences in Soviet views, they have been deadlocked and have not been opened up to this day. As Secretary of State Marshall said to the press on the 19th: "The Western countries have made long-term efforts to negotiate with the Soviet Union to resolve various important international issues, but they have failed to achieve results." These important international issues are also the various proposals put forward by Wallace. The Soviet Union's lack of sincerity in negotiating with the United States is obvious. Stalin's pose of striving for peace was seen through long ago, even before Secretary of State Marshall exposed it. In particular, Stalin is still singing the high-profile tune of the coexistence of communism and democracy, but after the coup in Czechoslovakia, who still deeply believes in it?

Every time we discuss the offensive adopted by the Soviet Union in the Cold War, we always say that the Soviet Union's methods are brilliant and surpass others everywhere. Especially this time, Stalin's reply to Wallace, on the one hand, indicated that only the Soviet Union truly loves peace; on the other hand, he fully supported Wallace, which could enhance his position in the United States, which can be described as "killing two birds with one stone." However, this ostrich-like method can only deceive ignorant people; but in today's United States, people have a considerable understanding of the post-war international situation and will never be deceived and indulge in a dream of peace. The American people have always admired freedom, and especially value the opinions of the opposition; but they will never blindly follow and agree with the opposition's willingness to be used by foreigners as a weapon against the United States. Therefore, Stalin's method may "backfire." Supporting Wallace may cause Wallace himself to be appeased and even flatter, and even advocate for "unconditional surrender" to the Soviet Union; but the result will inevitably cause Wallace to lose the sympathy and support of the American people, which will only be harmful and not beneficial to his presidential campaign.

### The Government Troops in Western Henan Launched a Two-pronged Attack on the Bandits and Recovered Ye County and Advanced into Wuyang. Powerful Reinforcements Arrived in the Outskirts of Laohekou.

[Our Nanjing Office, 20th] The Western Henan Bandit Suppression Corps recovered Deng County on the evening of the 19th and is advancing victoriously to the west, attacking the rear of the bandit troops in Guanghua and Laohekou; another government force recovered Ye County at 4:00 PM on the 19th.

[Our Xinyang Office, 20th] The government army's eastward advance corps launched a two-pronged attack on the bandits from Bao'anzhai. The northern route had already entered Ye County at noon, and the eastern route was pursuing and suppressing in the direction of Wuyang. The main force of Liu (Bocheng)'s Second Column and Chen (Yi)'s Tenth Column are showing signs of fleeing back to Liguanqiao. The government army's Zhang Zhen Corps continued to advance west from Deng County today and has now reached the area west of Houpo (60 li east of Liguanqiao), launching a fierce attack on the bandits near Liguanqiao.

[Another Dispatch] A portion of the 10th Column of bandits in Laohekou is reportedly causing disturbances along the left bank of the Xiang River towards Xiangyang. An elite government force is rushing to intercept them. Reliable sources say that Liu Bocheng has arrived in Laohekou.

[Our Hankou Office, 20th] Xinyang telephone report: The main force of Liu’s Second Column and Chen’s Tenth Column encountered Zhang Zhen’s Corps near Houpo and engaged in a fierce battle. The bandit army was completely defeated and is fleeing northwest.

[Our Hankou Office, 20th] A senior commander here solemnly stated today that only the area near Xuchang on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway has bandits roaming back and forth (belonging to the bandit's Third and Eighth Columns). The rumor that there are fierce battles in various strongholds south of Zhengzhou and north of Xinyang is absolutely not true.

[Another Dispatch] Military sources: Our powerful reinforcements have arrived in the outskirts of Laohekou. The bandit army is now in a dilemma, and the situation in Xiangfan is becoming more stable. The air force here dispatched aircraft today to support the war in western Henan and Laohekou, destroying dozens of bandit vehicles. Approximately 1,000 bandits who infiltrated Shayang and Hougang in central Hubei are being monitored and suppressed by government forces, and the navy has been dispatched to guard Shashi. The situation there has not changed much today. In addition, bandit forces infiltrated Anlu on the 18th, and there are also bandits roaming northwest of Yingcheng. Furthermore, the 16th Pacification Zone will hold a pacification conference in Xianning starting on the 21st.

### A Large-Scale Annihilation War in the Central Plains is Still Actively Being Planned. Remarks by a Senior General of the Army Headquarters

[Our Xuzhou Office, 20th] A senior general of the Army Headquarters met with our reporter alone this morning to discuss the war situation in the Central Plains. According to him: The war in the Central Plains has only just begun, and the real large-scale annihilation war is still being actively planned. The bandits who invaded the southwestern periphery of Wancheng and Nanyang, because large groups of government troops are about to encircle and suppress the area, are still sticking to the communist tactic of escaping, concentrating, annihilating, and sneaking away. One route is the Chen Yi's Tenth Column and Liu Bocheng's Second and Tenth Columns, which are fleeing south to invade Laohekou. Another route is the Chen Yi's Third and Eighth Columns and Liu's Third and Sixth Columns, which are invading the Pinghan Railway towns of Xiping, Yancheng, Xuchang, and Linying. Furthermore, if the bandits who invaded the Pinghan Railway continue to flee eastward in the future, the bandits on the northern bank of the Yellow River in western Shandong may move south to echo them and seize wheat on a large scale. As for why the Chen and Liu bandits are reorganizing and replenishing on the northern bank of the Yellow River, it is because the new recruits previously replenished on the southern bank of the Yellow River in western Shandong deserted and returned home as soon as the fighting started, resulting in heavy losses. Therefore, they must drive the troops from the northern bank of the Yellow River to the southern bank to fight. As for the battlefield in northern Jiangsu, because the terrain is favorable to us, a major battle may break out. In short, the government troops in the Central Plains and northern Jiangsu have perfect deployments and will seize the opportunity to capture and annihilate the main force of the bandit army.

### The National Army in Datong Converged on Three Routes. The Military and Civilians in Chengde Were Fully Mobilized. Railway Traffic on the Jin-Yu Section Resumed Yesterday.

[Our Beiping Office, 20th] The National Army in Datong launched an attack on three routes on the morning of the 18th.

### Use New People to Implement New Policies. Twenty Legislative Yuan Members Issue a Joint Statement, Providing Opinions on the Candidates for the New Premier.

[Our Nanjing Office, 20th] Legislative Yuan members Chen Yuntian, Chen Haicheng, Yang Youjiong, Yang Yuqing, Yang Dezhao, Du Guangqi, Zhang Jinjian, Song Shuqiao, Li Yuyao, Wang Menglin, Wu Wangji, Fu Tongxian, Li Peitian, Liu Jieping, He Zuozhi, Luo Qiyun, Wu Jianping, Wu Daoan, Shi Honggui, Xu Shaoqin, and others, considering that the choice of the first Premier is of great importance to future political reforms, have jointly issued a statement providing their opinions, stating: "For ten years, administrative leaders have mostly had no definite policies, only knowing how to perfunctorily handle matters and never paying attention to the demands of the vast majority of the people. The legislative branch has had no way to hold them accountable, and the impeachment of the supervisory branch has often been ignored. Now that the constitutional government has begun, we demand renewal for the leading figures in charge of administrative planning and oppose the method of putting old wine in new bottles. Today, the people of the whole country are eagerly expecting a thorough reform of politics. The people's lives are already suffocating under high prices. We hope that the Legislative Yuan, which represents the people, can bring about a new transformation in future politics. The power of consent granted to us by the Constitution should be exercised appropriately. Although we cannot make any harsh demands on personnel matters, we should review whether there have been errors in the political implementation of past officials from the standpoint of the people in order to refresh the people's eyes and ears. We oppose any former administrative leaders without political achievements from re-appointing as the future Premier. The current situation is very difficult, and the future Premier must have a policy plan that addresses the needs of the environment, seeks to improve the people's lives, and thoroughly innovates politics, and submit it to the Legislative Yuan. This policy plan must start from solving urgent practical problems, specifically listing the implementation procedures for economic measures, political reforms, and even education and culture, so that the Legislative Yuan can, in accordance with the provisions of Article 57, paragraph 1 of the Constitution, ask the Premier to submit periodic policy reports and assess their political performance. In the past, the magnificent articles of the administrative policy of the Premiers upon taking office were of no practical benefit, and there was no performance during their term of office, and even misled the country and harmed the people, and no one held them accountable. This is the main reason why politics has not been clear for many years. Now, in order to rectify the source, we must specifically review the concrete plan for its implementation at the beginning of agreeing to the appointment of the Premier and oppose empty administrative policies.

The above is what is of utmost importance to the political reform in the future. I would like to inform the people of the country and hope that they will advocate it unanimously."

### Chennault's Statement Denies Reorganizing the Flying Tigers

[Our News] Chennault, the general manager of the Civil Air Transport, in response to a report in a certain newspaper in this city on the 19th that Chen plans to reorganize an American Volunteer Group Flying Tigers to help China fight the communist bandits, issued a statement yesterday, solemnly stating that this news is not true, and said that the article is the author's speculation.

Chennault denied, saying: "I have never made any indication of intending to organize or preside over another American Volunteer Group to fight the communist army in China. I can repeat my remarks at the press conference on May 7 after returning to Shanghai from the United States this time: "I do not believe that China is currently willing to accept any foreigners to participate in the war against the communist army." At the same time, it must be stated again that I have never advocated that the U.S. military actually participate in the Chinese civil war. I only indicated that China would welcome U.S. technical training or consultants, but I have not been invited to be any consultant."

Chen continued: "The United States and China are obviously better prepared today than they were in 1941. Whether the United States will participate in the Chinese civil war is not my business. This matter should be decided by the highest authorities in China and the United States. I am unwilling to engage in armchair strategy." He also stated that he has now officially retired from the military and is currently in charge of the Civil Air Transport, transporting relief and reconstruction materials within China, transporting grain to war-torn areas, transporting raw materials to place B to restore industry, and transporting Chinese products to various ports for export to earn foreign exchange. I believe this work is extremely valuable, so I will continue to carry it out.

Finally, Chen also said: The reporter from the newspaper also asked right-wing military questions that I could not answer. Regarding the Chinese Air Force and its equipment, I have my own opinions. These opinions have been secretly submitted to the relevant authorities in Washington, but I will keep the numbers I submitted confidential until the appropriate time or before they are released by the person in charge.

### The Beijing-Shanghai Reporters Group Flew to Xi'an on a Special Plane to Visit the Northwestern War Zone.

### Continuing Rise of Xiang and Gan Rivers; Xiangyin and Yiyang Become Swamps

Lakeside Dikes and Embankments in Imminent Danger

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 20th] On the 20th, the Xiang River continued to rise fiercely, and Xiangyin and Yiyang were entirely submerged. The dikes and embankments of the counties along the lake were in imminent danger. Telegrams were sent to the provincial government to report the emergency.

### Sino-Australian Customs Agreement Officially Signed Yesterday Afternoon

According to reports, the main purpose of this agreement is to curb the serious smuggling problem in South China. Its nature is similar to the Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement. The main content is that the Macau government prohibits all ships from sailing to China or from China to Macau at night. For goods that China prohibits from importing, the Macau government will not issue export permits. This agreement will take effect five days after the completion of the legislative process. It is also learned that after completing his official duties in Macau, Li may go to Hong Kong again to discuss the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement.

### Presidential Directives to the Five Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Regarding the President's directives to the Five Yuan and the method of announcing the appointment of officials after nomination and approval, the Office of the President's Civil Affairs has drafted four measures, which were reported to the last (19th) State Council meeting yesterday. The measures are recorded as follows:

(1) For documents from the President to the Legislative Yuan, the term "memorandum" is to be used. The Legislative Yuan is organized by legislative members elected by the people, and its President and Vice President are elected by the members, without presidential appointment. Furthermore, Articles 39 and 72 of the Constitution state that cases passed by the Legislative Yuan for the President to implement use the terms "request for transfer" or "transfer." Articles 43, 55, and 69 of the Constitution stipulate that cases submitted by the President to the Legislative Yuan use the terms "submit" and "request for instructions." Based on the above articles, the exchange of documents between the Legislative Yuan and the President will be done by memorandum.

(2) For documents from the President to the Control Yuan, the term "memorandum" is also to be used. The Control Yuan is organized by control members elected by provincial and municipal assemblies, and by Mongolian, Tibetan, and overseas Chinese organizations. Although the election of members is indirect, its nature is similar to the election of legislative members. The election of its President and Vice President is similar to that of the Legislative Yuan, and differs from the President's nomination of the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Yuan, who are appointed after approval by the Control Yuan, and from the Premier of the Executive Yuan, who must be nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan before being appointed. Therefore, the exchange of documents between the Control Yuan and the President will follow the example of the Legislative Yuan and use the term "memorandum."

(3) For documents from the President to the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuan, the term "order" is to be used. The Presidents of the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuan, and the Vice Presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuan, are all nominated and appointed by the President, which differs from the election of the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the Legislative and Control Yuan by the members. Therefore, the term "order" is to be used for documents from the President to these three Yuan.

The Five Yuan are originally equal in status. Now, the President uses the term "memorandum" for the Legislative and Control Yuan, and the term "order" for the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuan, which is unbalanced. However, the Constitution stipulates this way, so it seems impossible to follow the old system completely.

(4) Except for the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the Presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuan and the Grand Justices, who are appointed after approval by the Legislative Yuan or Control Yuan according to the Constitution, the previously used method of "election and appointment" is no longer appropriate. From now on, the term "nomination and appointment" will be used to distinguish it from special appointments.

### Inauguration of the First President and Vice President; Deeply Celebrated at Home and Abroad; Jinan Releases Captured Communist Bandits to Return to Their Hometowns

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The first President and Vice President under the Constitution were inaugurated in the capital today. Celebratory rallies were held throughout the country and by overseas Chinese, and congratulatory telegrams were sent. As of 10 p.m. tonight, this agency has received dozens of telegrams reporting the grand celebrations in Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Kaifeng, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chongqing, Changsha, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Guilin, Guiyang, Hefei, Taipei, Hangzhou, Kunming, Gui Sui, Zhangjiakou, Xuzhou, Jinan, Chengdu, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Xianning, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Sydney, Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, Manila, Seoul, and other places. Furthermore, many cities that had banned dancing made an exception today to lift the ban, celebrating with universal joy.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 20th] Amidst the nationwide celebrations of the President's inauguration, the military here, in reverence for the President's virtue and to show the government's magnanimous policy, released a group of captured bandits, including Zhu Litian, after providing them with ideological education and exhortation, and issued them travel expenses based on the distance of their journey, and ordered the local government to ensure their safety and not discriminate against them.

### National Army in Northern Jiangsu Recaptures Muyang; Nearby Strongholds Also Recovered One After Another; First Pacification Zone Formulates Measures to Assist in Harvesting Wheat

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The National Army in northern Jiangsu recaptured Muyang last night after fierce fighting.

[Our Xinpu Dispatch, 20th] Muyang, Yinping, Gaoliu, Sanglu, and other places have been successively recovered by the army advancing northward from Huaiyin on the 20th.

[Our Taixing Dispatch, 20th] Last night at 8 p.m., a group of bandits who sneaked into Diaojiapu on the Kou (An) Taixing highway burned down the Zitong Temple, robbed the property of the town head Zhu Huruo and others, and abducted many refugees. They then fled towards the border of Taixing, Taizhou, and Jingjiang counties. The National Army is tracking and suppressing them.

[Our Nantong Dispatch, 20th] As the wheat harvest is approaching, the First Pacification Zone, in addition to launching suppression campaigns, has specifically formulated measures to assist in harvesting wheat, ordering subordinate units and county governments to comply, setting a deadline for negotiating specific measures, implementing them effectively, and mobilizing refugees to return to their hometowns to rush the harvest, in order to ensure the grain supply and thwart the Communist army's attempt to seize grain. The Jinsha area of the county's seventh district has formed a team to begin harvesting north of the Fan Gong Dike.

### Senate Foreign Relations Committee Endorses U.S. Participation in Collective Security System, All Based on the UN Charter

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 19th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today unanimously passed a resolution in principle endorsing U.S. participation in regional and collective security measures within the appropriate provisions of the United Nations Charter. The resolution is based on the working report issued last week by Committee Chairman Vandenberg. The resolution also authorizes the United States to take action, seeking voluntary agreements with other nations, so that the veto power in the Security Council does not apply to issues involving peaceful resolution of disputes and the admission of new members to the United Nations. The proposal to amend the great power veto has been submitted by the United States to the Interim Committee of the General Assembly. The resolution is supported by the State Department and is consistent with the views expressed by Secretary of State Marshall and U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations Austin. Marshall and Austin recently testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly opposing changing the UN Charter at this time. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is also studying the organization of the United Nations. Vandenberg said that the resolution is unlikely to be submitted to the full Senate for consideration for at least two weeks. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is extensively gathering views on proposals to strengthen the United Nations, and will hold a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to draft a statement on the Committee's views.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee today unanimously passed a resolution that could test whether the Soviet Union is willing to take action within the United Nations to support peace conferences. The resolution, proposed by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, will urge President Truman to use his full power to ensure that the United Nations has more tools and fewer vetoes. The resolution advocates limiting the veto power of the five major powers in Security Council resolutions that do not involve the use of armed forces, supports U.S. aid to collective security alliances based on self-help within the scope of the United Nations Charter, and calls on the President to work towards the organization of a world peace force and arms limitation regulations with prevention of violations. Vandenberg emphasized that the purpose of this resolution is not directed at the Soviet Union or any other major power, but the Soviet Union has been the most determined opponent of amending the UN Charter, and the U.S. action to promote this amendment will show the truth of the Soviet Union's recent "peace offensive." The bill does not bind the President, nor does it necessarily need to be submitted to the House, but if both the Senate and the House approve this proposal with an overwhelming majority, it will be difficult for Truman to oppose it.

[United Press, New York, 19th] U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations Austin said today at the annual meeting of the National Academy of Social Sciences, "The Soviet Union has a direct and continuous opportunity to demonstrate its willingness to cooperate with the United States on peace." He continued, "The world only needs the cooperation of the Soviet Union to protect the world from the threat of atomic destruction. This is the main point that needs to be resolved. It cannot be resolved through negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union alone, but must be resolved within the United Nations in cooperation with other member states."

### Communist Party Disrupting European Balance; Britain Determined Not to Stand Idly By; Foreign Secretary Bevin Warns Soviet Union in Speech

[Reuters, Scarborough, Yorkshire, 20th] Foreign Secretary Bevin warned the Soviet Union today in a speech at the Labor Party annual conference here that Britain cannot stand idly by when Europe cannot independently lean towards the totalitarian side. Bevin delivered the government's foreign policy direction during the general debate on the government's foreign policy. During the debate, Labor left-wing member Zilliacus vehemently attacked the government's foreign policy. Bevin declared that he had no intention of changing the Russians' belief in communism. If the Russians want communism, it is none of Britain's business, and there is no need for Britain to urge them to change their beliefs. However, Europe's attitude towards communism is a completely different matter, and Britain will not allow a communist minority to disrupt the European balance against the will of the people.

Communism is welcome to stay within the borders of the Soviet Union, but it must not disrupt the situation in Europe again. He hopes that the Soviet Union is now able to recognize that the Western world has the determination not to allow the tragedy of Czechoslovakia to be repeated. Earlier, Zilliacus vehemently criticized the government's failure in all aspects of international relations, and he had to point out that most of the current unrest in the world is due to the lack of a fixed policy by the British Labor Party. He specifically requested the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Greece, saying that unless Britain is willing to make people think that Britain is interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, the government has no reason to continue stationing troops in Greece.

### U.S. House Passes Anti-Communist Bill

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Mundt-Nixon bill with an overwhelming majority vote on the 19th, allowing the U.S. Communist Party to choose between severing ties with Moscow or going to jail. After eliminating all attempts to weaken this measure or return the case to the Un-American Activities Committee, the House passed the bill by a voice vote of 319 to 58. This bill will now be submitted to the Senate for discussion, and will impose the most severe resolution ever applied to a political group in American history on the U.S. Communist Party and its "front" organizations. During four days of heated debate in the House, the bill was denounced as unconstitutional, creating "thought control," and endangering the personal freedom of all Americans. However, the bill will face a difficult struggle in the Senate, and President Truman has indicated that he will veto the bill if it is presented to him for signature.

### Britain Urges European Unity to Become a Bridge of Peace

[Reuters, Scarborough, Yorkshire, 19th] The Labor Party Executive Committee has accepted a resolution proposed by Labor Party member Brockway at the Labor Party annual conference, which calls on the government to promote closer unity between European countries and the liberated nations of Asia and Africa. The resolution states, "The Labor Party conference is deeply dismayed by the trend towards establishing blocs of strong Eastern and Western powers, and believes that the Conservative Party's idea of organizing a Western European alliance based on capitalism and military alliances with the United States will not only fail to solve Europe's economic problems, but will also lead to a third world war." Brockway pointed out that Churchill hopes that Europe will establish imperialist relations with the nations of Asia and Africa, while the Labor Party is willing to see unity between Europe and the liberated nations of Asia and Africa. Churchill wants Europe to become the front line in the war between the United States and the Soviet Union, while the Labor Party wants Europe to become a bridge of peace between East and West.

### Finland Brewing Political Upheaval; Interior Minister Impeached by Parliament

[United Press, Helsinki, 20th] The Finnish Parliament impeached Interior Minister Leino, one of the leaders of the Finnish Communist Party, by a vote of 81 to 60 on the 20th. According to the Finnish Constitution, Leino must resign immediately. It is believed that the impeachment by Parliament will lead to a political upheaval, and Communist Prime Minister Pekkala will also resign to take responsibility. The impeachment motion was proposed by Conservative Party leader Salminen on the 19th and was passed after heated debate late into the night. Leino is accused of unilaterally extraditing ten foreigners from the Soviet Union into Finland in 1945 without the authorization of the Cabinet. Leino argued that he was forced to do so by the Soviet control group. Leino, in his capacity as Interior Minister, controlled the security police, and some have accused him of placing Communists in the police force to assist the Finnish Communist Party.

### Fierce Battles on the Northeastern Line of the Holy Land; Jewish Forces Launch Counteroffensive in Southern Galilee; Jewish and Arab Forces in Jerusalem Engaged in Close Combat

[Our Report] New York Radio, 20th: Washington Report: The Egyptian Army issued a communique stating that the Egyptian Army has occupied the two cities of Suneit and Beersheba and is rapidly advancing towards Tel Aviv. In addition, the Jewish forces defending Jerusalem, after suffering a fierce attack by the Arab Legion, have lost some positions. The Holy City is under bombardment, and many historical sites have been destroyed by artillery fire.

[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 20th] Arab national forces and Israeli forces have engaged in large-scale combat in the northeastern part of Palestine, at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee. Israeli forces have advanced northward in a fan-shaped formation from the transportation hub of Beit She'an, 15 miles southeast of the Sea of Galilee, launching a counteroffensive against the Iraqi and Syrian troops moving towards the Jewish agricultural area there.

The Jewish area there was bombarded overnight by Arab aircraft. Six Arab aircraft in formation bombed and strafed the oldest Jewish settlement in Palestine in the Jordan River valley, Degania. Jewish farmers who have never experienced war, under the guidance of the Haganah, have also dug trenches and set up defenses behind the front line. Near the city of Samakh, at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee slightly to the north, there was also close-range combat between Arab and Jewish forces.

[Reuters, Cairo, 20th] The Egyptian Ministry of Defense announced that Egyptian forces have occupied Deir Sneid, ten kilometers north of Gaza, and confirmed that Egyptian forces on the eastern route have occupied Beersheba, thirty miles southeast of Gaza on the road to Jerusalem.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 20th] Arab and Jewish forces are engaged in close combat, fighting for Jerusalem. It is reported that many fires broke out in the Old City on the 20th. The British said that due to artillery and mortar fire, the Christian center, a sacred place longed for by Western countries, has become a battlefield. The war in Jerusalem is being reported unclearly due to strict censorship of news by both the Arab and Jewish sides, but no matter which side wins, this ancient city will have to undergo its 19th reconstruction in history. Jewish sources admit that the fighting in the area is intense, and both the Jewish and Arab sides are sending reinforcements for a decisive battle. House-to-house combat is taking place in each building. The Arab side claims that all Jewish forces in both the new and old cities have been completely surrounded.

[Reuters, London, 19th] Syrian forces announced that they have occupied the city of Samakh and the railway station on the border of Palestine, as well as nearby fortresses. The Haganah has also acknowledged this.

### British Reporter Killed in Action

### Applying Pressure on Britain to Force Arab Withdrawal from the Holy Land

U.S. Congressman Makes Proposal to the House

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] New York State Democratic Congressman Celler said yesterday in the House of Representatives that unless Secretary of State Marshall can force Britain to withdraw the Arab Legion of Transjordan from Palestine, he will introduce a bill to stop providing aid to Britain under the Marshall Plan. He said that Foreign Secretary Bevin could stop the Arab Legion's invasion of Jerusalem with a single word. If the United States is willing, Bevin can order these Arab "dogs of war" to withdraw. He believes that Britain will certainly not dare to continue to engage in things that the United States does not agree with.

### South Korean Interim Assembly Dissolved; Rhee Syngman Urges U.S. Troops to Remain Stationed

[United Press, Seoul, 20th] The South Korean Interim Assembly was dissolved today after the election of 200 representatives to the National Assembly in the South Korean general election on May 10. The Interim Assembly was established on December 12, 1946, and has passed 93 bills to date. The original number of members was 70, but one was assassinated, several died of illness, and many resigned collectively, so only 49 attended today's closing ceremony.

[Associated Press, Seoul, 20th] Rhee Syngman, leader of the Korean Democratic Party, said today that U.S. troops must remain stationed in South Korea until the new Korean government has established an army of 200,000 men, or North Korea may take drastic action.

### Chinese Muslims Support Arab War Against Jews

[Associated Press, Peiping, 20th] The Peiping branch of the Chinese Muslim Youth Association today telegraphed King Farouk of Egypt through the Egyptian Embassy in Nanjing, stating that a committee to aid Arabs has been formed to support the Arabs in fighting their mortal enemy, the Jewish invaders. The sacred war of the Arabs to fight for their national and religious survival and freedom is of great concern to the 50 million Muslims in China. They firmly believe that God will grant them glorious results.

### U.S. Considering Revising Middle East Arms Embargo

Marshall Announces to Reporters

[United Press, Washington, 19th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall said at a press conference on the 19th that the United States is still considering whether to take action to revise the current arms embargo to the Middle East. However, the United States will not make any decision on this matter until the United States knows what attitude the Security Council will take on the recent U.S. proposal to the Security Council to declare that the situation in Palestine is a threat to world peace.

### Soviet Union Expresses Surprise at Recognizing Contradictory U.S. Statement

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 19th] TASS issued a communique tonight summarizing the views of Soviet leaders on the statement made to the press last night by the U.S. Department of State, stating that although Stalin did not make a formal proposal to the U.S. government, the document he issued on May 17 was only a response to an open letter from U.S. Third Party presidential candidate Wallace. However, the U.S. Department of State believes that it is necessary to make a special statement to the press regarding Stalin's reply. The State Department, on the one hand, recognizes the importance of Stalin's document and the need for a peaceful solution to various issues related to world peace, but on the other hand, it said that the specific issues included in Stalin's reply cannot become the subject of direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. If these issues, such as the control of atomic energy and certain issues in the Council of Foreign Ministers, are discussed jointly with other countries, they will achieve nothing due to the Soviet Union's opposing attitude. People here are very surprised to learn of this statement from the State Department.

### US FORCED HOLY LAND TRUCE PROPOSAL: CHINA AND BRITAIN BOTH EXPRESS OPPOSITION; US INSISTS ON STRONG ACTION BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL

[This newspaper's dispatch] New York, 20th (Broadcast): Success Lake News, the Security Council today listened to the report from the Palestine Truce Committee, which strongly urged the Security Council to take firm action to force the Jewish and Arab sides to comply. Any action of a recommendatory nature would be difficult to achieve results, and the Arab side's attitude is particularly forceful.

[United Press, Success Lake, 19th] Today, both China and Britain opposed the US-Soviet proposal for a mandatory truce in Palestine at the United Nations Security Council. Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu said that the Chinese government finds it difficult to agree with the US proposal.

The United States advocates achieving peace through partition, but China has always believed that a solution acceptable to both Jews and Arabs must be found. It is better for the United Nations to be weak and just than to be strong and unjust. China insists on a just resolution to this issue. At the same time, British representative Cadogan suggested that the Security Council once again appeal to both the Jewish and Arab sides for a truce and order the Palestine Truce Committee to continue mediation. Cadogan said that if the United Nations adopts sanctions or sends troops to suppress the situation, the British government cannot agree, because the United Nations has no military force. US representative Austin immediately stood up to object, insisting on the original proposal and invoking Article 7 of the United Nations Charter to implement the most urgent punishments for aggressor nations. Austin said that the Security Council's appeal for a truce has had no effect, and more forceful action should now be taken. The rift between Britain and the United States on the Palestinian issue has gradually become clear, and it is expected that the US proposal will inevitably fail.

### THE SUGGESTIONS MADE BY THE KULLAP DELEGATION VIOLATE THE FAR EASTERN COMMISSION'S POLICY; REMARKS BY WU BAN-NONG, HEAD OF THE CHINESE REPARATIONS DELEGATION

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Wu Ban-nong, head of the Chinese Reparations and Restitution Delegation, said today: The suggestion made by the Kullap delegation that "only the main war industrial equipment in the arsenals owned by the Japanese government should be allocated for reparations" will completely overturn the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy toward Japan. Wu pointed out that this report is "arbitrary and lacks factual and numerical basis." Wu said: If this recommendation is adopted, Japan will obtain the foundation of heavy industry and easily be converted into war industry. He also pointed out that the Far Eastern Commission stipulates that major war industries should include not only the army and navy arsenals owned by the Japanese government, but also aircraft manufacturing and private munitions factories. Wu said: Johnston is even more advanced than Strauss, as he even suggested removing aircraft manufacturing plants and private munitions factories from the reparations list. Johnston is, in effect, not only suggesting preserving Japan's war potential, but also suggesting retaining Japan's war industry. This is clearly contrary to the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy toward Japan, which clearly declares that "the existing economic basis of Japan's military power must be destroyed, and it must not be allowed to have any chance of rising again." Wu continued: There is no reason to preserve Japan's aircraft manufacturing plants and private munitions factories.

### TRUMAN REQUESTS CONGRESS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS TO ASSIST THE RECONSTRUCTION OF JAPAN AND KOREA

A total of 150 million US dollars

[French News Agency, Washington, 19th] President Truman today sent a letter to Speaker of the House Martin, requesting Congress to vote to appropriate 150 million US dollars to fund the reconstruction plans of Japan, Korea, and the Ryukyu Islands. This appropriation supplements the 1.25 billion US dollars in "relief for occupied areas" funds requested by the government in January.

### ITALY SENDS A DIPLOMATIC NOTE TO THE FOUR POWERS, REQUESTING CLARIFICATION OF THE BORDER BETWEEN ITALY AND YUGOSLAVIA; SIX FOREIGN AIRCRAFT DETAINED IN ITALY

[French News Agency, Rome, 20th] The Italian Foreign Ministry revealed today that the Italian government has sent notes to the British, American, and Soviet embassies in Rome and the Yugoslav legation, requesting the four powers to clearly define the border between Italy and Yugoslavia. The note accused the Yugoslav government of repeatedly undermining and causing disputes on the current provisional border line, creating a difficult situation.

[United Press, Rome, 20th] The Italian government detained six foreign aircraft on the 20th because they landed in Rome and Sicily and were suspected of flying to Palestine. Staff at Rome's Urbe airport said that three planes arrived here from Nice, France, on the evening of the 18th, intending to fly to Brindisi, which is the starting point for Italy's connection to Greece and the Holy Land. The other three planes landed in Catania, Sicily, on the evening of the 18th.

### MARSHALL'S STATEMENT: LISTS ELEVEN IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL ISSUES, PROVING THAT THE SOVIETS HAVE NO SINCERE INTENTION TO SEEK RESOLUTIONS

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The State Department today responded to Stalin's acceptance of the points listed by Wallace as the basis for US-Soviet differences. Marshall emphasized that what the world urgently needs today is concrete and remedial actions taken by the Soviet government. Only based on these actions can it be shown that Marshal Stalin has the sincerity to resolve the differences between the two countries.

The State Department also listed eleven important international issues, all of which have failed to reach an agreement due to Soviet obstruction:

(1) "Disarmament": Since 1946, this matter has still been under study by the United Nations Security Council's Disarmament Committee.

(2) "Atomic Energy": Officials of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission have accused the Soviet Union, Poland, and Ukraine of obstructing the establishment of an effective international agreement on the control of atomic energy. The United Nations is still facing the problem of international control of atomic energy, and the US government is still prepared to participate in any truly effective control.

(3) "German Peace Treaty Issue": Almost every suggestion made by Britain, the United States, and France has been opposed by the Soviet Union, which is the reason for preventing all progress.

(4) "Japanese Peace Treaty Issue": The United States has suggested convening an eleven-nation conference to draft a peace treaty with Japan, adopting a two-thirds majority vote in the meeting. However, the Soviet Union insisted that the matter be handled by the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Although China agreed to convene an eleven-nation conference, it advocated that the four powers retain the right to veto all resolutions. So far, these widely divergent opinions have not been resolved.

(5) "Withdrawal of Troops from China": Currently, there are only 1,496 US Army personnel and 4,115 US Navy and Marine Corps personnel in China.

(6) "Korean Issue": The United Nations General Assembly passed a plan for Korea last year, but the Soviet Union did not allow the United Nations Korean Commission to enter North Korea. The Soviet Union not only refused to cooperate in implementing the United Nations plan, but also attempted to unilaterally implement its own plan, which could lead to civil war in Korea.

(7) "Respect for the Sovereignty of Other Countries and Non-Interference in Internal Affairs": This matter is very broad, but the actions of the US and Soviet Union can be judged by public opinion.

(8) "Military Base Issue": The United Nations General Assembly had previously resolved that member states must obtain the free and openly expressed consent of the host country to station troops in other member states. The agreements established between the United States and the countries where troops are stationed have been reported to the United Nations. In addition, the United States has also suggested to the Security Council that all armed forces under the command of the Security Council have unrestricted transit rights and the right to use bases everywhere, but the Soviet Union has rejected this proposal.

(9) "International Trade Issues": The Soviet Union refused to participate in both the Geneva and Havana conferences.

(10) "Assisting War-Torn Countries": The assistance provided by the United States to other countries around the world through the United Nations or other channels is a suitable answer to this point.

(11) "Human Rights Issues": The United Nations Human Rights Commission is drafting a declaration and convention on the protection of human rights. Since the US and Soviet Union are both members of the commission, it is unclear what other methods can be used to handle human rights issues.

### PLANNING TO THOROUGHLY STABILIZE PUBLIC UTILITY PRICES; SENATE DECIDES TO PETITION IN NANJING; REQUESTING THREE MONTHS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR COAL; PUBLIC UTILITY BUREAU IS STUDYING REVISIONS TO THE AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT FORMULA

[This newspaper's dispatch] The Municipal Senate's Public Utility Investigation Committee held its third meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, with 25 people including Speaker Xu and others present. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utility Bureau, also attended to report. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to petition the central government in Nanjing to thoroughly stabilize public utility prices. Participating units include: the Municipal Senate, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Cotton Spinning Association of the Six Districts, the Flour Association of the Four Districts, and the Industrial Association, a total of five groups. The petition is directed to seven locations: (1) the Presidential Office, (2) the Central Bank, (3) the Executive Yuan, (4) the Legislative Yuan, (5) the National Economic Commission, (6) the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and (7) the Ministry of Finance.

The petition requests the central government to subsidize or at least achieve the following points: (1) Pre-settlement of foreign exchange for public utilities for three months. (2) Advance supply of coal for public utilities for three months, and preferential treatment for coal prices for public utilities. (3) All tariffs on fuel accessories, machinery, etc., used by public utilities should be waived, or at least the tax rate should not exceed 18% as in the case of industrial oil, and settlement should be made at the official foreign exchange rate. Regarding the progress steps and departure date, it was decided to first convene representatives of various legal entities to exchange opinions and then depart around this month. For the selection of petitioners, the Municipal Senate side nominated Senators Shao Yongsheng, Jiang Hao, Huang Bingquan, Fei Shusheng, Li Wenjie, Ma Junshuo, etc., and requested one of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to participate. Each other group will nominate one representative per unit.

The meeting also decided that the materials supplied by the Public Utility Bureau will be studied by the senators first, and meetings will be convened in three groups on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of this month to review and then begin the investigation.

In the automatic adjustment formula for public utilities promulgated and implemented by the central government, some public utility formulas were previously pointed out by the Public Utility Group of the Senate as being unrealistic. The Public Utility Bureau is now actively studying revisions. According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utility Bureau, the research and revision work of the formulas found to be incorrect will take a considerable period of time to complete. The implementation of this calculation formula was initially a trial run. If there are inaccuracies, they can be revised and submitted to the central government for approval. It is feared that the revised new calculation formula will not be applicable in June.

### CENTRAL GOVERNMENT REDUCES AUTOMOBILE FUEL ALLOCATION; CITY SUBSIDIZES RESERVE FUEL; NO IMPACT THIS MONTH

[This newspaper's dispatch] The central government allocates a fixed amount of gasoline to the city for automobiles and factories every month, totaling 1.81 million gallons in April. Starting in May, the central government reduced the city's allocation to 1,496,350 gallons. The city's automobile fuel allocation for May was originally going to be reduced proportionally, but now the city government has a portion of reserve fuel to make up for the difference. Therefore, the automobile fuel allocation for May will still be allocated according to the original allocation. Starting in June, it will be reduced proportionally.

### SMALL FACTORY CIVILIAN COAL; DECISION MADE TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND DISTRIBUTION

[This newspaper's dispatch] For the first proposed allocation of civilian coal to small factories, after the Fuel Management Committee submitted the cost price, the Social Affairs Bureau added insurance, transportation, warehouse rent, and legal profit, etc. The price is now close to the black market coal price, so it was decided to temporarily suspend the distribution.

The Zhejiang Security Command has telegraphed to search and suppress them.

### LONGNING THEATER; DISTURBANCES HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN

[This newspaper's dispatch] Longning Grand Theater, No. 431, Lane 952, Longning Road, was performing Yue Opera. At about 9:45 PM last night, two traffic police officers entered the theater to watch the play. Because the staff member Zhu Changshun was a little late in receiving them, they used their belts to hit him in the buttocks. At the same time, there were 30-40 traffic police and road police officers present who smashed two emergency exit doors, 24 long benches, and 74 glasses. The theater called the Jing'an Temple Military Police Team and the Longning Police Station, and a large number of military police arrived, but the troublemakers had dispersed. It is reported that at about 4:00 PM yesterday, a plainclothes traffic police officer named Luo Changshun wanted to bring two women to the theater to watch a play.

### PRISONER WRITES LETTER TO BUREAU CHIEF; CONFESSES NO INTENTION OF INTIMIDATION

[This newspaper's dispatch] Lin Peishi, who wrote a letter to the chief of the police bureau, Yu Shuping, while in prison, was brought out of Shanghai Prison yesterday, and Prosecutor Yu Xinxin of the District Prosecutor's Office opened a court to investigate. Lin was a patrol officer of the Xincheng Police Station and had colluded with police officer Qi Wenming to extort bribes from vendors. In September 1946, he extorted 300,000 yuan per month and also demanded a pair of American swimming watches. At the end of the year, he issued a menu of chicken, duck, fish, meat, and vegetables to the vegetable vendors for purchase, but did not pay. After the vendors reported to the police bureau, he was transferred to the District Court and sentenced to five years of imprisonment for corruption. Lin was fined 30 days of detention for making a scene in court and was imprisoned in Shanghai Prison. Recently, Lin wrote a letter to Chief Yu in prison, with many intimidating words. The police bureau sent the letter to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. When Lin was brought to court yesterday, he confessed to writing the letter but said he had no intention of intimidation. After the interrogation, he was still sent back to Shanghai Prison.

### MUNICIPAL FINANCE FEELS MORE DIFFICULT AFTER INCREASE IN PUBLIC EDUCATION INDEX; SALARIES ALONE NEARLY 500 BILLION

[This newspaper's dispatch] The living index for public education personnel in this city in May has been decided by the Executive Yuan meeting to be 310,000 times, and the municipal financial revenue and expenditure will feel even more strained. Director of Finance Tian Yongqian told reporters yesterday: The expenditure in April totaled more than 510 billion yuan, and the revenue and expenditure shortfall was about 30 billion yuan. The expenditure in May, that is, the salaries of all public education personnel in the city, requires 470 billion yuan alone, plus other expenses such as office expenses and construction fees, totaling about 630 billion yuan. The Finance Bureau is currently using the "quick collection" method to speed up the collection of various taxes and donations to meet current expenditures, so it can still be handled in May no matter what. What he is most worried about is the financial difficulties in June, and he does not know how to get through it. At that time, the taxes that should be collected have already been collected, and the price fluctuations in May were severe, and the increase in the living index is already imaginable. A clever woman cannot cook without rice. So far, he has not been able to think of a solution. Increasing taxes and donations requires the consent of the Municipal Senate, so this problem will be submitted to the meeting for discussion when the Municipal Senate meets in June.

### FRENCH TRAM COMPANY; LABOR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTE RESOLVED

[This newspaper's dispatch] The labor-management dispute of the French Tram Company has been resolved through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau: (1) Punishment rules: In the future, for workers who are punished with work suspension due to negligence, a decision should be made as soon as possible to avoid the indefinite handling method used in the past.

### Foreign Exchange Rate Too Far from Black Market: Bristle Industry Appeals for Relief, Export Traders Will Collapse if Foreign Exchange Policy Remains Unchanged

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai pig bristle export industry hosted reporters yesterday, detailing the current pain of the industry and the general export industry, pointing out that due to the foreign exchange rate being too far from the black market, the national currency obtained by exporters for settlement cannot buy the original quantity of goods. This has led to the dwindling inventory of the seven or eight hundred export firms in the city, creating a difficult situation. If this foreign exchange policy is not changed, the entire export industry will be able to maintain itself for at most two or three months, and will eventually collapse. Under this low foreign exchange policy, the number of smugglers is increasing. Taking pig bristles as an example, smugglers to Hong Kong amount to hundreds of tons. The government's export foreign exchange income for the last month was only over 1 million US dollars, and the export foreign exchange income for this month is feared to be at most 5 million US dollars. If the export industry collapses, the consequences will be serious. Only with exports can there be imports. If there is no income from export foreign exchange to pay for the price of imported necessities, then the import of necessities will be drastically reduced, which will inevitably lead to soaring prices and social unrest. The industry has decided to take advantage of the government's restructuring and the refreshing of everything to propose two specific suggestions to the government: (1) The government can stipulate in the future whether a certain commodity is allowed to be imported, regardless of the foreign exchange rate of imports and exports. (2) If this point is difficult to implement, please ask the government to re-determine a reasonable exchange rate based on the actual purchasing power of legal tender and US dollars. The above two points are the fundamental methods to save the export industry. As for emergency relief, it is hoped that (1) the time limit for promissory loans will be extended to at least two months. (2) For goods exported at the end of May, it is hoped that the settlement of foreign exchange will be postponed for one month at the time of export, and the loan will be given in full according to the listed price of the foreign currency sold first. (3) The pig bristle manufacturing process takes more than three months, and it is hoped that the government will provide production loans to thoroughly increase the amount of debauchery in order to earn foreign exchange. The loan is guaranteed to be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of foreign exchange three months later.

### Production Prices Rise Frequently, Goods Arrive Rarely: Rice Prices Continue to Rise Yesterday, Cooking Oil Price Increase Slightly Slower, Miscellaneous Grains Rise Sharply

The rice market saw another rise yesterday. Because the price increase in Xishi was frequently reported, and because of the rain, few goods arrived. In addition, the method of selling rice by the Civil Survey Commission changed, and the selling price in the North City was increased by 100,000 yuan. Early rice was called 5.5 million, and Wuxian rice was 5.3 million, with each firm limited to buying 20 shi, half japonica and half indica. 2,640 shi were sold. Although the selling price in the South City Market did not change, each firm was limited to buying 10 shi, also half japonica and half indica. The quantity was too small to meet the needs of the market. A total of 1,120 shi were sold in the South City, so people became more bullish and merchants pushed up prices more fiercely, vaguely claiming to reach the 6 million mark. Ordinary white japonica was 5.9 million, and special high-quality japonica was priced at 6.2 million. White Yuan reached 7.2 million, each increasing by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Yesterday, 2,003 shi arrived in the North City, and the South City sold a total of 3,024 shi.

Flour also tended to rise again. Because the prices in inland areas such as Wuxi rose, factories rarely opened. The China Trust Bureau still jointly sold it, but only miscellaneous brand flour, the price was still 1.8 million yuan delivered, and the number of applications reached 50,000 bags. However, whether it will be fully approved has not yet been decided. Lao Che and Bingsheng and other first openings were once 1.95 million, and later slightly retreated to 1.93 million yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng were both 1.9 million, each rising 80,000 yuan. Bran also rose by 25,000, and the wheat factory's disk increased by 50,000, to 2.8 million yuan.

Miscellaneous grains continued to rise. Due to the rise in rice prices, people were bullish. Merchants had the strength to hold on, and soybeans finally rose by 10,000. Hankou Zhadou closed at 3.3 million yuan, but the market has already shown a soft appearance. Corn was taken by the Yantai gang, rising by 250,000 yuan. Qidong corn was 4.05 million yuan. Red sorghum's inland turnover was still active, adding another 200,000 yuan. The guest gang did not take up the pump beans, and the local sales moved slightly, adding 50,000 yuan. Picked green rose by 150,000 because of scarce inventory. Xieqiao picked a green opened at 2.9 million yuan, sesame Tianjin gang's willingness to pay was very good, rising another 400,000 to 500,000. Raw peanuts continued to rise by 1 million yuan under the reabsorption of the Guangdong gang.

The increase in cooking oil prices has been relatively peaceful. Because the arrival of goods has increased slightly, there is no shortage of households. Qingdao Jisheng oil increased by 50,000, the factory's opening of soybean oil seemed not low, but the retail appetite was not strong. There was a lot of excess soybean oil at 14.2 million, a slight increase of 200,000. Rapeseed oil increased by 200,000, hot rapeseed oil increased by 600,000 to 700,000, flat car sesame oil increased by 500,000, bean cake increased by 40,000 to 50,000, but there were no actual sales, the market retreated later, and finally slightly increased by about 10,000 yuan.

### Commercial Situation in Various Places

### Comprehensive Sale of Cotton Yarn and Cloth from the China Textile Construction Corporation; Sluggish Cotton Yarn and Cloth Market

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw a significant rise in prices initially, which made the "foreign firms" (客帮) hesitate and caused the bulls (多頭) to sell off, leading to a generally stable market sentiment. The initial asking price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was quite high, but due to tight credit among businesses, individual investors cut their losses, driving the price down to 288 million yuan. Near closing, short covering activities caused the price to rise slightly, eventually closing at 290 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million yuan from the previous day. The initial price for 21-count Double Horse yarn jumped by 3 million yuan, but speculators and "foreign firms" sold off, leading to sluggish sales on the local market. As a result, the price was slashed by 5 million yuan. Besides, only 10-count Boy Scout and Golden Treasure Star yarns saw a slight increase of 1 to 2 million yuan due to actual sales. The prices of other yarn counts, both coarse and fine, decreased by 1 to 2 million yuan to approximately 4 to 5 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw news of foreign banks releasing a large quantity of US dollars, and the Central Bank continued to tighten credit. The "Tian Yi" firms could not transfer funds in time and thus sold off a large amount of stock. "Shanmen" firms and dyeing factories rarely engaged in transactions, while cloth merchants took the opportunity to sell high. The market's selling pressure increased, and 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially jumped by 200,000 yuan but then plummeted to 6.52 million yuan due to aggressive selling by financial firms and cloth merchants. By closing, short covering improved the market, closing at 6.6 million yuan, a slight decrease of 50,000 yuan from the previous day. Off the market, the price was slashed by over 200,000 yuan, but selling continued even after closing, with bids gradually decreasing to 6.55 million yuan, where some were willing to sell. Other fine cloths and serges also declined. Only coarse cloth, fine twill, and Shilin cloth saw an increase of 200,000 to 400,000 yuan.

### Manufacturers Preparing to Apply for Low-Price Allocation of Raw Silk

Concerns Remain Regarding High Processing Costs

Following the announcement by the Rations and Transportation Committee (輪管會) that the government would allocate raw silk at a low price of US$3.50 per pound to silk weavers to supply finished products for export in exchange for more foreign exchange, weaving manufacturers are mostly preparing to apply. However, they still have hesitations because domestic processing costs are too high, accounting for approximately 63% of the total cost. Based on international market prices, exporting finished products would inevitably result in losses. Given the initial allocation of 200 dan of raw silk, assuming it is all woven into 140,000 yards of double crepe, the loss would be as high as US$42,000. According to industry analysis, raw silk is sold to manufacturers at US$3.50 per pound, equivalent to US$465.50 per dan. Converted at the current official exchange rate, this equals 218.8 million legal tender (法幣). If used to weave 40-inch double crepe, each piece requiring 7 catties (9.5 pounds) of silk would cost 15,314,000 legal tender. Including processing fees and all preparatory expenses, each yard costs 350,000 legal tender. With each piece being 50 yards, the cost becomes 17.5 million legal tender, totaling 32,814,000 legal tender, which equals US$70 per piece or US$1.40 per yard. However, the current overseas market price is only US$1.10 per yard, with a CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) price of US$55 per piece in New York, a difference of US$15. According to preliminary accurate calculations, 200 dan of raw silk woven into 140,000 yards of double crepe would result in a loss of approximately US$42,000. If double crepe is estimated this way, other finished products can be easily inferred. The government's fixed silk price of US$3.50 is undoubtedly too high, and there is no subsidy for labor costs. Given the current high cost of living, matching American silk prices remains difficult. However, exporters, considering the government's good intentions to promote exports, are striving to reduce costs. Even if there is no profit, they are stepping up planning to try exporting in order to earn foreign exchange.

### Samples of Precious Eyebrow Tea at Local Tea Firms

Yesterday, the tea market saw a continuous stream of visitors at local tea firms offering Wenzhou precious eyebrow tea samples for the current year. However, prices were repeatedly raised, reaching as high as 14 million yuan per load. Exporters ultimately found the price exorbitantly high and remained hesitant, resulting in a quiet market. Transactions for other tea varieties were also sluggish, with ordinary trading volume. As for domestic sales of black and green tea, Tianjin and other regions continued to lack vitality, while local shops continued to make small purchases. Merchants also frequently increased prices, but the final result, except for the thirty-year-old Keemun black tea about to be unpacked, saw consistent fluctuations for new Longjing tea and other varieties.

### Interbank Clearing Breaks Record Again, Totaling 1,500.9 Billion Yuan

Yesterday, the interbank lending market in the city became increasingly tight. The four national banks, two bureaus, and one treasury reported a unanimous net clearing outflow in the exchange of bills among silver and money merchants, totaling 1,500.9 billion yuan, setting a new record for the amount of net clearing outflow.

### Overseas Remittance Income Decreases Monthly

According to sources at the Bank of China, overseas remittance income has been decreasing since the beginning of this year. The total amount of overseas remittance income in January was over 60.844 billion yuan, which decreased to over 30.09 billion yuan in February, a decrease of over 30.7 billion yuan compared to January. March saw over 29.378 billion yuan, a further decrease of over 7.12 million yuan compared to February. The total amount of overseas remittance income for April is still being calculated, but it is expected to be lower than March. Calculated at the current official exchange rate for US dollars, monthly overseas remittances can only generate over 60,000 US dollars, the lowest figure in recent years. An official in charge of the International Department of the bank stated that the current market price of foreign exchange is completely disconnected from the black market price. Without adjusting the exchange rate, the decline in overseas remittance income cannot be reversed. Overseas remittances are one of the largest sources of national foreign exchange income. When the government's foreign exchange income and expenditure cannot be balanced and overseas remittance income cannot supplement it, it is necessary to improve the foreign exchange policy.

[United Press Singapore, 19th] Government authorities announced today that the total amount of remittances to this country from overseas Chinese in Malaya in April was 1,114,973 Malayan dollars.

### Counselor Liu of the Ministry of Education Issues Statement Explaining Standards for Registration of Private Schools, Stipulating that Opening and Operating Expenses are Only 100,000 Times Pre-War Levels

[Our Report, Nanjing, 20th] In response to a report in the Jingbao newspaper that a few unregistered private middle school principals were planning to petition the Legislative Yuan in the coming days, requesting a reduction and amendment of the regulations due to the high amount of opening and operating expenses stipulated in the recently promulgated standards for registration of private schools by the Ministry of Education, Counselor Liu Yingshi specifically told reporters that the current price index is approximately 600,000 times higher than pre-war levels, and the cost of living index for public school teachers in the Beijing and Shanghai areas has been adjusted to 310,000 times, but the opening and operating expenses for private schools are still at 100,000 times the pre-war standard. Therefore, the funds needed to establish a private school now, calculated by the price index, are only one-sixth of the pre-war amount. Compared to the tuition standards charged by various private schools, the difference is still significant. The fact that a few unregistered private school principals are still planning to request a reduction shows their lack of attention to school equipment and the welfare of staff and students. The relevant authorities will not consider such requests. Also, regulations are either promulgated by the Ministry or approved by the Executive Yuan and do not typically go through legislative procedures.

(1) Whether the sports associations of each unit should be organized on a regular basis. The resolution stipulates that the representatives of each unit should establish an organization within two months after returning to their original place of residence.

(2) Whether to propose changes to the Overseas Chinese electoral district of the All-China Sports Association. The resolution states that due to different customs and laws in each region, a letter will be sent to the Association requesting that the six units form a separate district, with each district electing two representatives as directors. If this proposal hinders the constitution of the Association, it will be requested to temporarily appoint six representatives from the units as honorary directors.

### Draft Charter of the Overseas Chinese Sports Committee

(1) Name - Officially named the Overseas Chinese Sports Committee.

(2) Purpose - To connect the overseas Chinese sports associations in various regions, jointly promote sports, and enhance the position of overseas Chinese sports internationally.

### Mayor Wu Extends Condolences to Athletes Staying in Shanghai for the All-China Games; Northeastern Athletes to Return North Today

[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu is very concerned about the fact that athletes from various regions have been delayed in their departure due to waiting for ship schedules after the successful conclusion of the 7th All-China Games. Yesterday morning, he specially sent Zhang, the chief of the municipal government's protocol section, to the athletes' dormitory of the Central Training Corps on Shuidao Road to express his condolences. He met with Liu Huakun, the leader of the Northeast team, and Tian Zhiceng and Zhao Borong, the representatives of Tianjin. Representatives from Hebei, Beiping, and other regions were out and not present. Athletes from various regions expressed their gratitude for Mayor Wu's condolences. It is reported that the group of approximately 100 athletes from the nine northeastern provinces will take the China Merchants Bureau's Xuanhuai ship north today. The Tianjin and Qingdao teams, totaling hundreds of people, will take advantage of the convenience of the maritime transport of grain and supplies and embark on an initial voyage on a mid-range ship. Due to continuous rainy days, cargo loading has been delayed, and they will not be able to set sail until the 24th.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### A Casual Discussion on Human Body Fever

— Liang Junqing

We typically regard fever in the human body as a pathological condition. However, "is fever truly a disease?" "What is the meaning of fever?" We may not all fully understand. Therefore, I have specifically chosen this topic to discuss, in order to provide people with a new concept of human body fever.

We must understand that our human body temperature is absolutely mobile. Normally, in a healthy state, it measures between 36 and 37 degrees Celsius in the armpit. Its daily variation is only about six-tenths of a degree Celsius. However, if we measure it in the anus or mouth, then even in a normal physiological state (and while resting), it will be three to five tenths of a degree Celsius higher. According to the "Holler's Internal Medicine Clinical Pathology Diagnosis," published last year, the body temperature of a physiologically normal person, measured in the anus after strenuous exercise, can rise to 39 degrees Celsius, while a measurement in the armpit will show only a slight increase. Moreover, if the test subject is allowed to rest for an hour and then retested, their body temperature will return to normal. This type of fever that occurs after exercise is called "work fever" (Arbeitshyperthermie). However, the aforementioned work fever requires a normal body temperature regulation mechanism to occur. There are two functions in this body temperature regulation mechanism: one is the generation of heat, and the other is the dissipation of heat. Heat generation is produced through the oxidation process within the blood and tissues, involving chemical changes. Heat dissipation, on the other hand, is mostly a physical process. These two functions are absolutely controlled by the heat regulation mechanism in the nervous center, which responds to heat and cold and regulates them at any time. Based on numerous biological experiments and clinical studies (for example, puncturing a certain area in the brain with a needle immediately causes a heat response, etc.), we now know that the nerve center for regulating heat is located near the midbrain, especially between the gray matter nodule (Tuber cinereum) and the linear eminence (Corpus striatum). The nerve center that regulates heat in this area receives cold and heat stimuli from all parts of the body through the transmission of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves and exerts its regulatory instinct. In addition, the endocrine system also plays a significant role in regulating heat. Among them, the thyroid gland, pituitary gland in the midbrain, and adrenal glands are even more important in regulating heat. For example, when thyroid secretion increases, not only does metabolism increase, but also body temperature increases. Therefore, those suffering from goiter often have a slight fever. Conversely, if the thyroid gland is removed or thyroid secretion is reduced, the body temperature immediately decreases, and the hands and feet are often cold. When measured with a thermometer, the body temperature is often around 36 degrees Celsius. We also have similar clinical experience with patients with adrenal gland problems. People with adrenal gland dysfunction often have very low body temperatures, and their hands and feet are often cold. Their metabolism is also reduced at the same time. Conversely, if a patient suddenly suffers from adrenal gland hemorrhage, they will have a high fever, as if suffering from a very acute infectious disease. We have surgically removed the adrenal glands of certain animals, and as a result, the animal never developed a fever and died within a few days as its body temperature gradually decreased. Even if its midbrain was punctured with a needle (please refer to the previous text), it would no longer have a fever response. It can be seen that both the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands have a significant impact on the regulation of heat. In addition, we can also use adrenaline to stimulate a person or an animal to develop a fever. In short, a part of our body's heat regulation mechanism is in the midbrain within the brain, and the other part is within the endocrine glands. If the aforementioned two parts develop pathology, then the body temperature will deviate from its normal state and cause various diseases.

In the fever conditions of various diseases, it is of course caused by a disturbance in the heat regulation mechanism. However, how this disturbance occurs remains to be studied by us. According to clinical experiments, the chemical composition of the patient's blood must change in fever conditions, thereby stimulating the heat regulation mechanism and causing it to work abnormally, resulting in pathological fever. In many cases of pathological fever, the brain area is of course most likely to be stimulated and cause functional disturbances. For example, cancer sleep near the midbrain, as well as encephalitis and brain syphilis, can all cause very high body temperatures. However, most pathological fevers are caused by the stimulation of pathological chemical substances in the blood (such as toxins secreted by bacteria and foreign proteins, etc.). In addition, if chemical substances are absorbed into the body or are developed in the body, high fever often occurs. For example, Atropin, Cocaine, and Adrenaline can cause people to develop a fever. We doctors may encounter a heart disease patient who suddenly develops a fever after being given the cardiotonic drug digitalis and not know the reason. In fact, digitalis is the culprit.

However, I must also add that many people simply have no symptoms. If their body heat cannot be released (for example, the windows are closed too tightly or they are wearing too many clothes), they may also have a high fever, which is not a cause for concern. Also, I must add a few more words, that is: people suffering from neurosis or hysteria often have quite high fevers during the onset of neuropathological conditions, which is also not a cause for concern.

As for true disease-related fevers, they are mostly infectious fevers. This is of great importance to our protection and treatment. Regarding the forms and types of these fevers, we can describe them in great detail. However, due to space limitations and detailed discussions in other specialized works, I will not go into further detail.

### Common Knowledge About Vaccination

— Wu Yiqun

Recently, smallpox has been prevalent in Shanghai. I think all parents are anxious about their children, fearing that they will contract this terrible disease that can lead to death in severe cases and "pockmarks" in mild cases. At the same time, they will naturally think about taking them to get vaccinated against smallpox. However, most people have a very vague understanding of the basic knowledge of smallpox vaccination, and many questions often arise. The most common ones are:

(1) From what age after birth can and must a child start vaccination?

(2) Does vaccination need to be done once a year?

(3) If vaccination does not produce a blister, does it need to be repeated?

(4) If a child has had smallpox, do they need to be vaccinated?

(5) If one child in the family has smallpox, should the other children be vaccinated for prevention?

(6) Can a child be vaccinated if they are sick?

(7) Can a child be vaccinated if they have scabies or dampness (a common term for eczema or similar skin diseases)?

(8) Do adults who had smallpox or were vaccinated in childhood need to be vaccinated again?

To answer these questions, it is necessary to have a considerable understanding of the principles of vaccination and immunity. Smallpox is an infectious disease. After people have had the disease once, their bodies will produce a substance that resists the smallpox virus, enabling the body to resist and eliminate it when it comes into contact with it again, so that it does not harm the body and cause disease. This substance is called an antibody. According to general experience, people who have had smallpox once can, with the help of antibodies, avoid being infected again for life, that is to say, they can acquire lifelong immunity.

However, there is a valuable discovery in medicine that people do not necessarily have to contract severe smallpox to acquire this antibody. It is sufficient to artificially inoculate the smallpox virus locally on the skin, and the body can similarly produce enough antibodies and acquire immunity. However, this immunity can only be maintained for a certain period of time. After a few years (at most five to ten years), the antibodies will gradually decrease until they disappear completely. At that time, the susceptibility to smallpox infection will be the same as that of people who have not been vaccinated.

Vaccine is the smallpox virus, but it has been inoculated on cows once and extracted from the smallpox sores on the cows, so that its toxicity is greatly reduced. (After being inoculated on cows, the toxicity of the smallpox virus is greatly reduced, which is also a valuable discovery in medicine.) In this way, when we inoculate the slightly toxic smallpox virus "vaccine" on humans, we get two effects: (1) Because of the slight toxicity, no blisters occur elsewhere except locally. Although the body has a systemic reaction when vaccinated for the first time, it is far milder than natural smallpox and does not contain any danger to life. (2) The body can acquire enough antibodies to resist smallpox infection. This is truly a beneficial and harmless thing, and nothing could be more ideal. Therefore, vaccination has become the gospel of mankind all over the world.

With this basic knowledge, we can answer the above questions one by one.

(1) After a child is born, their body still retains some of the smallpox antibodies received from the mother (in fact, mothers have all had smallpox or been vaccinated and have antibodies). These antibodies disappear after three to several months. Therefore, within three months after a child is born, they have considerable but not complete immunity to smallpox. That is to say, they are not easily infected with smallpox, but it is not absolutely impossible to be infected. Therefore, our answer to the first question is: If there is no risk of infection from the outside world, it is best for a child to be vaccinated between the fourth and sixth months after birth. If smallpox is prevalent and the child cannot be completely isolated from the outside world, then they should be vaccinated regardless of how many days they have been born.

(2) As mentioned above, smallpox vaccination can maintain immunity for at least five years, so vaccinating every year is not necessary. - This of course refers to those who have previously been vaccinated and have developed blisters - but if smallpox is prevalent, due to the convenience, harmlessness, and low cost of vaccination, getting vaccinated again is naturally also a beneficial and harmless thing.

(3) The answer to the question of whether re-vaccination is needed if the vaccination does not take depends on whether it is the first vaccination or has been vaccinated multiple times. If it is the first time and it does not take, then it must be waited one or two weeks before vaccinating again, until the inoculation site develops blisters. If it is the second or third year and it does not take, this is precisely an indication that the body already has the ability to resist the smallpox virus, at least it is not necessary to continue vaccination in that year.

(4) A child who has had smallpox does not need to be vaccinated again.

(5) If one child in the family has smallpox, the other children must be vaccinated immediately for prevention. To understand this question, attention must be paid to the following three points: 1. The production of smallpox immunity occurs approximately on the eighth or ninth day after vaccination. 2. The incubation period for smallpox is fourteen days. 3. A child with smallpox acquires infectiousness to healthy children approximately during the prodromal period, that is, one or two days before the rash appears. Therefore, if a family has one child who develops smallpox blisters, then the other children, assuming they have already been infected, were infected at the earliest one or two days before that, that is to say, they should be in the second or third day of the incubation period at this time. If we vaccinate them immediately, antibodies can be produced on the eleventh or twelfth day after they are infected. At this time, smallpox has not yet broken out, and we can often use the help of these antibodies to eliminate the disease invisibly.

### Farewell to Dr. Liu Yongchun's Departure Abroad

— Song Guobin

After graduating from the Zhen Dan University Medical School in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Dr. Liu Yongchun was sent abroad by the school authorities for further study. Because Mr. Liu had not studied neurology in China, he first studied this subject after arriving abroad. Three years later, based on his clinical research, he wrote a thesis and took the examination at the University of Strasbourg in France, earning his doctorate. Subsequently, he served as the clinical director of the Strasbourg Medical School for two years. No Chinese person had ever held such a position in France before, and no one has succeeded him to this day. Mr. Liu returned to China in the seventeenth year of the Republic. A year before his return, he went to the Pasteur Institute in Paris to study microbiology. Mr. Liu knew that Chinese medicine could not advance as rapidly as specialized fields in Europe and America, and that Chinese society had not yet developed a need for it. Indeed, after Mr. Liu returned to China, he could not develop his knowledge of neurology, nor could he use his expertise in microbiology. Reluctantly, like talent from Chu being used in Jin, he accepted a position at the Pasteur Institute in Saigon, Annam, in the eighteenth year of the Republic, where he was in charge of vaccine affairs. He made special efforts to improve the manufacturing technology of various vaccines. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic, the Shanghai Pasteur Institute was established, and Mr. Liu was appointed by the President of the Pasteur Institute in Paris as the director of the vaccine department of the Shanghai branch. From the thirty-third year of the Republic, he was promoted to vice president of the institute, while still overseeing the vaccine department. In the old Shanghai concession era, millions of cubic centimeters of cholera and typhoid vaccines used annually in the foreign concessions were personally supervised and manufactured by Mr. Liu day and night. Mr. Liu has devoted himself to the vaccine business for twenty years. His research on rabies vaccine and BCG has never ceased, and he has gained much experience. BCG anti-tuberculosis vaccination in Shanghai began in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, and has a history of eleven years. A total of more than seven thousand people have been vaccinated with the vaccine made by Mr. Liu. Although BCG vaccine has been adopted by European countries for a long time, the Chinese medical community has been skeptical of its effectiveness for the past few years. In addition to manufacturing this vaccine, Mr. Liu wrote articles or gave lectures to discuss its use in detail. At the same time, he personally vaccinated children and tested its effectiveness to make accurate statistics, day after day for more than ten years. Recently, Chinese people have gradually become aware of this vaccine, which is due to Mr. Liu's promotion.

Mr. Liu is cautious, disciplined, and humble. He never dared to be satisfied with his work achievements. He always wanted to serve the country with what he had learned. He was unwilling to entrust himself to foreign-run businesses. Now, the first International BCG Conference is being held in Paris and Lille, France. Its purpose is to discuss various BCG issues, and also to commemorate Professor Calmette, the inventor of BCG. Thinking of the source of water when drinking it, the intention is very profound. Mr. Liu was invited by the Paris General Hospital to attend the conference, and I was moved by this. No one in China has been as dedicated to BCG work for so long as Mr. Liu, so it is appropriate that he was hired by France. This time, Mr. Liu can discuss with world BCG experts, which is an honor for Mr. Liu and a blessing for the future of BCG in our country. Recently, Denmark has been promoting its scholars' unique secrets in BCG. At the public conference, or in individual talks with Danish experts, or even in a trip to Denmark to see the situation, this mystery will not be difficult to solve. I think that the Pasteur Institute in Paris not only still leads the world in BCG research, but also its other departments are no less advanced than those of other countries. Mr. Liu's academic advancement on this trip is foreseeable. Paris is the location of the United Nations Tuberculosis Prevention Organization, and it is also the center of world culture. Mr. Liu is enthusiastic about tuberculosis prevention and loves literature and art. In addition to his research on BCG bacteriology, he will also pay attention to social hygiene and cultural undertakings!

### Adding Fuel to the Fire

— Wu Yong

"The May Price Hikes" made people's moods tense. The authorities only came out to talk about "fundamental solutions," "stopgap measures," and "treating both the root and the branch," but prices had already reached the point where "a team of four horses couldn't catch up." After that, the situation only stabilized for three days. On the 17th of this month, the exchange rate suddenly adjusted again. The US dollar suddenly rose from 320,000 yuan to 470,000 yuan, an increase of nearly 50%. This style of fearing that prices won't rise and fearing that the world won't be in chaos is truly heartbreaking to relatives and secretly pleasing to enemies!

Just a few days ago, I was talking to a friend about the black market exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars. According to the 14th's newspaper, in order to prevent the daily publication of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate from stimulating prices, the Joint News Agency has stopped sending such telegrams. The mayor of our city, Mr. Wu, expressed his gratitude for this. I think that the daily publication of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate in the newspaper does have a negative impact on prices. However, both the Taiwan dollar and the French currency are currencies under the rule of the Chinese government. Why, according to reports, does the ratio change almost daily, and why is it changed every day?

Now, the price of the US dollar and other currencies suddenly rose by nearly 50% on the 17th of this month, only three days after the price hikes had calmed down. Some say that the exchange rate has been adjusted for a month and ten days since the last adjustment on the 6th of last month, so it is not an exaggeration to raise it this time. I think that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee and the Central Bank are both financial institutions affiliated with the government. Since the beginning of this month, hasn't the Central Bank already issued a short-term treasury bill? According to the recent discount on this treasury bill, the interest rate is about 2.34% per month. The Central Bank issued such a high interest rate, on the one hand, to compensate the purchasers of the bonds for the devaluation of the French currency they held, and on the other hand, to absorb floating capital and stabilize the currency. However, the exchange rate has risen so much this time, which means that the currency has depreciated by nearly 50% in a month and ten days. Readers, think about it, haven't the people who bought treasury bills suffered a loss? Doesn't this situation fully indicate that the Equalization Fund and the Central Bank are not in step with each other and are not cooperating in their actions?

Some say that the purpose of the Equalization Fund's adjustment of the exchange rate is to promote the export of domestic products and the acquisition of foreign exchange. In fact, once the exchange rate is adjusted, the prices of domestic export goods immediately increase in proportion, and often increase more than the exchange rate increase. This is not my nonsense; the past facts are there for you to review. The reason why the exchange rate has repeatedly increased over the past year, while export goods have not been promoted and foreign exchange has not been acquired, lies here.

The solution, in my humble opinion, lies not in acquiring foreign exchange from abroad, but in stabilizing the value of the domestic currency. Raising the exchange rate means devaluing the currency. This measure is a poor one. When the currency value is stable, export goods will naturally be easier to promote, and overseas remittances will not be difficult to come in steadily. If we don't do this, even if the exchange rate rises to today's black market level, it will only stimulate the black market to rise again wildly. In this way, we still won't be able to acquire foreign exchange, but instead will only cause the currency value to fall to an irreversible level, benefiting a small number of wealthy people who hold large amounts of gold, US dollars, and materials.

Looking at the authorities' various measures, such as allowing state-owned public utilities such as railways and transportation to raise prices at every turn, the Central Trust Bureau adopting high-price bidding methods for selling purchased materials, state-owned enterprises selling valuations calculated in US dollars, and the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau's talk about the necessity of purchasing food rice at the end of last month, things like this make people feel that the authorities seem to have no intention of stabilizing the currency value. It seems that the government does not even trust the French currency it issues. The purpose of the general public valuing goods over currency is nothing more than to maintain the original currency value. But in this situation, the people's income is not enough to make a living, and the officials' income is not enough to maintain integrity. It is really difficult for us to persuade people not to hoard goods, not to speculate, and not to be corrupt.

The other day, the financial authorities issued a statement regarding rumors of changes in the foreign exchange policy, saying: The authorities must base all economic measures on the interests of the majority of the people. This statement hits the nail on the head and is the most important. I hope that you will act accordingly!

### What World Is This?

— Haiyan

A friend from Beibei talks: A Mr. So-and-so is employed by the Central Industrial Laboratory. He and his wife both graduated from the Chemistry Department of Jinling University and hold technical positions. A year after their marriage, his wife became pregnant. After a doctor's examination, he said that she must be hospitalized to prevent dystocia. This kind woman was unwilling to increase the burden on her husband, so she did not dare to try. Unexpectedly, she recently suffered from dystocia. After surgery, the baby survived, but the mother passed away. Her husband held his son and a four million yuan medical bill, wandering along the riverbank, wishing he were dead.

After being tempered by the treacherous environment of the past six or seven years, having experienced the joys and sorrows of middle age, and believing that my feelings have gradually become wooden and insensitive, I couldn't help but sob when I read this news.

Isn't our backward country urgently demanding industry? Why are technical talents treated so cruelly!

Isn't this female technician studying natural science? Why is she so indifferent to the scientific examination report and so dismissive of her own life?

Haven't we lost hundreds of thousands of nationals in the war of resistance and urgently need to encourage childbirth? Why are women giving birth persecuted so much?

What world is this!

### Su Dongpo's Love of Opium

— Nian Xin

The poppy is the predecessor of opium, and its flower shape is quite beautiful. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties in our country, books have often mentioned it. However, in the beginning, it was mostly used as medicine, such as for treating diarrhea, calming the nerves, and relieving pain, which is the anesthetic effect. (Anesthetics originated in Greece, and the Greeks knew how to use them more than a thousand years ago.) Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty already recorded it. In fact, as early as the Song Dynasty, scholars and officials used it to "regulate the lungs and nourish the stomach," but they only decocted the poppy in soup, not like the modern way of smoking it with a lamp. For example, the Su brothers were quite fond of eating it. The poem by Dongpo, "The Taoist advises me to drink chicken soup, the boy can offer poppy soup," is evidence of this. His disciple You Che's poem on planting medicinal seedlings also says: "The farmer told me that poppies can be stored. Small as a bottle, seeds fine as millet. Planted together with wheat, ripened together with millet... The old man has asthma, eats little, meat is indigestible, vegetables have little taste, willow mallet and stone mortar, mixed with honey water, smooth and pleasant to the throat, regulates the lungs and nourishes the stomach. Closed the door for three years, no one knows who comes and goes, hermits receive monks, forget words when facing each other. Drink a cup of it, laugh happily. I came to Yingchuan, as if I were touring Mount Lu." This also praises its efficacy. Even earlier in the Tang Dynasty, Guo Tuo's Book of Planting Trees said: "Plant poppies on the ninth day of the ninth month and the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the flowers will be big and the seeds will be full." They were also used to cook porridge or put in dishes. I remember that an emperor of the late Ming Dynasty (name forgotten) took what was called "island pills" (?), which was also opium.

### Difficulty of Reading

— Jing Wen

In these days, it should be said to be rare for an ordinary person to still have the interest in reading in his spare time, and it should be said to be even rarer to have the economic means to buy one or two favorite works in addition to daily life. Education is a privilege for us, and reading in one's spare time is even more of a luxury.

Now a thin booklet or a very ordinary magazine costs hundreds of thousands of yuan at every turn. The number of hundreds of thousands of yuan is naturally not a big deal for people who are eager to see "New Mermaid". However, this is a matter of interest; the audience who likes to see "pretty legs" probably only limit their interest in reading to movie manuals and movie star magazines, so these people are not affected by the high price of books.

According to a bookseller, the current situation in the publishing industry is that the more expensive the price, the more likely it is to sell. For example, the art books published by a certain publishing house last year, and the art yearbooks advertised on a large scale in newspapers recently, although their circulation is not huge, the number of buyers is not weak. This is because booksellers know the current market situation well. They know that although the appeal of this type of book is not widespread, the "gimmicks" of "cloth-bound gilt" and "grand and magnificent" are indeed somewhat attractive to the psychology of wealthy merchants and gentlemen who want to climb the social ladder.

The most lacking in sales security are some general single-volume books with prices that are neither too high nor too low. This is because the normal sales of these books depend on ordinary readers, and these ordinary readers are students above the high school level and amateur readers, who are the most economically disadvantaged people in society today. The "Complete Works of Lu Xun," which costs tens of millions of yuan on the black market, is of course beyond the reach of these people, and even new books that cost four or five hundred thousand yuan are only available to them with reluctance.

The situation for Western books is even worse. There are originally fewer readers of Western books. Very few people can afford new books with an average price of about three US dollars, and probably not many people can afford to buy one Western book a month, except for reference books. At present, the main sales of general Western books are probably limited to foreigners.

For a period of time after the war, the sales of Western magazines could be said to be quite good, but now, apart from "Reader's Digest" and "Life" magazines, they must be much worse. As far as I am concerned, I used to buy four or five magazines to read every month, but now I only have enough money to buy one or two, but the cost is already close to a million.

Currently, the "Reader's Digest" is the most affordable Western magazine in terms of size and price. Although I have no prejudice against this publication, I always feel that things like "digests" lack the fresh atmosphere that one should have when reading a new book. The book is naturally new, and the printing is extremely eye-catching, but perhaps because the content of this publication has been selected and digested by others, although I know that the content still contains the essence, I can't help but feel that something is missing. Especially because this book strives for universality too much, and the content is so broad that it is not easy to detect its excellence.

I believe that if the purpose of reading in one's spare time is really to seek self-improvement, the most important thing is to maintain the interest in reading. Reading in one's spare time is different from reading in the classroom. What is read in the classroom can be said to be a broad sense of "digests"; things like university books, although they can be used as extracurricular self-improvement tools, are definitely not suitable for reading in one's spare time. The requirements of reading in one's spare time, in addition to satisfying knowledge, also contain a kind of interest requirement of reading for the sake of reading.

For example, when buying a publication, the main goal is naturally its content, but sometimes the content is not desirable, but because there are a few illustrations and a few fillers in it. Sometimes, it is even because its layout is novel and pleasing to the eye. After buying it, I don't want to read it seriously, but just flip through it casually and then put it aside. This may seem like a waste to some people, but the interest in reading often lies in it. Such reading, although not seeking thorough understanding, is nourishing and refreshing, and has unconsciously exerted the power of self-improvement.

The above statement is just a personal prejudice, which is naturally different from the utilitarian view of reading. Now everything emphasizes efficiency, scientization, and certificates. There is also a so-called scientific method. Like the educational philosophy of the United States, it focuses on knowledge as life. Some people in China have also experimented with it. I naturally never object to this. But this only applies to tangible education. However, the above-mentioned reading in one's spare time puts knowledge in the second place and wisdom in the first place. If you regard knowledge as the rudder of a ship, wisdom is actually the water on which the ship sails. Not seeking thorough understanding of reading may have limited gains in increasing knowledge, but developing the habit of reading will probably be beneficial in inspiring wisdom.

However, in today's situation where the majority of book lovers can only sigh at the sight of books, all of this is mostly said in vain.

### Trumpet Creeper

— Liu Yun

The trumpet creeper is a outstanding one among the vines. Looking at it is like a celestial immortal in the sky, with the thought of being free and detached from the world. But to get this flower, you must first accumulate strange rocks and ancient trees to wait, otherwise there is nothing to attach to and live, and even if you live, it is not worth seeing.

This flower is also named purple wisteria. It can be several feet high, with tendrils between the vines like geckos. Its feet are attached to the tree most firmly. After a long time, the trunk is as big as a cup. Branches are born in early spring, one branch has several leaves, pointed and long with teeth, dark green. Each branch blooms more than ten times, as big as morning glory, the flower head has five petals, with several yellow spots on it. It is full in mid-summer, and even more red in late autumn, which is very beautiful, but the fragrance is inferior, and it hurts the brain if it blooms for a long time.

The ancients praised trumpet creepers, saying: "There is a tree named trumpet creeper, which is absolutely beautiful and not a solitary standard. It occasionally relies on a tree, and then draws hundreds of feet of branches, rooting on the tree trunk, and blooming flowers on the tree tip. It thinks it has the advantage, and there is no reason to shake it. Once the tree is blown down, it will be broken and will not end its life. Tell those who establish themselves, do not learn from weak seedlings." Poets express their feelings through objects, and the implication is profound. It is not just an excuse to express opinions, but a perfect proverb for self-establishment. At this time and place, it is especially thought-provoking.

### West Lake

— Jiao Xichen

The surrounding mountains are majestic and beautiful, no different from the solemn appearance of Buddha, making my mind wander beyond the world, suddenly opening a line of blue sky. (Lingyin)

Climbing up the steps halfway up the mountain, sipping tea and resting in Taoguang, cutting off a corner of the lake and mountains, leisurely entering my poetic bag. (Taoguang)

According to legend, Chunyang cultivated Taoism and practiced alchemy here. A pool of clear water outside the cave, please let me see your face. (Alchemy Terrace)

The jade spring is clear to the bottom, quietly watching the fish happily. I am not envious of the fish by the abyss, but I pity the troubles of the world. (Jade Spring)

### Two Poems on Ancient Temples

— Shi Shufan

The monks of Jing'an Temple set up an Ibo fast to raise money for medicine for the poor, and held a meeting with literary friends. During the banquet, they happily received new friends, and then became drunk. That night, there was a heavy rain, listening to the clear sound of carrying tiles, there was the fun of wearing a bamboo vest, and they dispersed after the bell was ringing.

I seek to turn the drunken ink into coolness, not busy like Mu Mei with Buddhist incense. The ancient temple is lit with lamps, and the poetic muscles are red. The spring buds boil with rain, and the wine flowers are yellow. We promise that the sky can see it. This night, we forget the world. On the way home, the bell rings, and our clothes and hats are messed up, and the passengers cheer and the shadows follow.

The lamp marks hang on the temples, and the wine marks are dry. Looking around, the fragrant orchids are still dreaming! Why must we meet to make friends? It is most difficult to bare our hearts because of a sentence. One kindness can save the thick green mountains, and half a wall of lonely chanting can make the white hat cold. From the moment I received the Qingfei, it flowed full of my grip, and I repeatedly looked at it hundreds of times deep into the night.

Literary men and artists often name their studio after their inkstone, considering it a close friend in the study, with a solid and lasting quality, worthy of cherishing memories. On a fine name card presented by Yu Chuqing, seen after Li Meigang's (Qing Daoren) postscript, there is a seal that reads "Huanglong Inkstone Studio". Also, Weng Tanxi himself wrote the inscription on the Huadu Temple stele, signing it below with "Si Yan Qi South Window Notes". Both studio names are very beautiful and elegant. Connoisseurs praise that the middle of the Duan stone has a streak of yellow, which is the Yellow Dragon. Whether the one collected by Li is like this, I dare not say for sure because I have not seen it with my own eyes. Although the name "Yellow Dragon" is magnificent, it is not as elegant and refined as "Green Inkstone". Moreover, green is the most life-giving among all colors. Westerners interpret this color as Colour of Growing Grass, and also say Full of life and vigor. The famous lines of Chinese poets, "The east wind has turned the Yingzhou grass green", "Moss traces are green on the steps", "The garden grass is green at will without people", "Green willow city is Yangzhou", "Silk arrives at Yangzhou, which bridge?", "After the rain, someone plows the green field", all have a kind of "expression of life", implicitly in the words and questions, so they can intoxicate people's hearts and spread through the mouths of the masses. Modern people who pay attention to urban construction often say "greening", which means beautiful trees, shade, and fragrant grass like a blanket. The "green-clothed people" who are postal messengers also coincide with "holding green islands" without prior consultation, all with some gentle affection and artistic intention. Therefore, although Scholar Weng has many studio names, "Green Inkstone" is the most beautiful. At first, I thought it was something like "green Duan", but now I have obtained it unintentionally. It is not "stone" but "tile", which is even more interesting. In the past, there were certainly not a few tile inkstones, but such an inkstone's "aesthetic sense" is probably not much, so it is appropriate for the old man Tanxi to name his studio and to wish this inkstone's everlasting existence with "a tile from the Shu Palace, may it last for ten thousand years". I dare not refuse the responsibility of guarding it, so I call myself "the keeper of the green inkstone".

Among the collectors of inkstones, Ji Yun (Xiaolan) of Hejian was the most specialized, rich, and famous. Ji's study was called "Ninety-Nine Inkstone Studio", and each inkstone had its own inscription and record. Since it was praised by the literati, it is untrustworthy to borrow names in the market, whether it is purple or green, new or old, pretending to be "Guanwei Cottage", or "Xiaolan", or "Ji Yun". The only one I have seen is the inkstone in the collection of Zhuo Xingcha, the brother of Huayang. It is definitely an old object of Ji, Zhuo's ancestor, Wengong (Bingtian, zi Haifan, a scholar of the Qing Daoxian period, and the governor of Shuntian Prefecture). Zhuo entered the Jinshi in the Wangxu year of Jiaqing, and Ji was the chief examiner of the hui examination. Later, they were both seniors and juniors in the Hanlin Academy. They personally inherited his mantle and were given the inkstone, which has been passed down to this day. The shape of the inkstone is long, with slightly convex sides like a drum. There is an inscription on the back that reads, "Hold and compare it to the old pit, far behind it. But compare it to the new pit, you are slightly older. Although the borders are narrow, its thickness is valuable. Rest in the ink forest and quietly nourish your longevity. After another hundred years, you will also be a rare sight." This is a pun, one to write about the inkstone, and one to express people. The wonder lies in its natural and fitting, casual writing that is thought-provoking. At a glance, one knows that it cannot be done by ordinary hands.
