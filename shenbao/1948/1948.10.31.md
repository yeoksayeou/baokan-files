Many people spoke at the time, offering opinions on both principle and technical aspects. Finally, it was decided that the spirit of the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Measures promulgated on August 19 would not be changed, but in order to adapt to the current actual situation, the following two points would be discussed and implemented as soon as possible: (1) The remuneration of public servants and teachers, according to the provisions of Articles 18 to 21 of the Measures for Consolidating Finance and Strengthening Control of the Economy, has become extremely difficult after the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates and will be improved. (2) The prices of state-owned, private, and public utility and transportation enterprises will be determined separately, taking into account the actual situation and with reference to the provisions of Article 14 of the Measures for Consolidating Finance and Strengthening Control of the Economy.

### Legislative Yuan Budget and Financial Committees Discuss the Public Servant and Teacher Remuneration Plan

[Our Nanjing Office, 30th] The Legislative Yuan's Budget and Financial Committees held a joint meeting on the 30th to discuss various proposals related to improving the remuneration of public servants and teachers. Some members believed that since the Executive Yuan would announce a solution to the current economic problems within one or two days, which would certainly include improving the remuneration of public servants and teachers, it was unnecessary for the Legislative Yuan to offer any opinions at this time. However, most members believed that the living conditions of public servants and teachers were difficult and that this matter could not be delayed any longer, and that the Legislative Yuan should immediately make a statement. Finally, it was decided to submit the two proposals put forward by Bao Huaguo and others and Jin Shaoxian and others to the Yuan meeting for a decision. The proposal put forward by Bao Huaguo and others focuses on principles, the main points of which are that in addition to strengthening the provision of goods in kind, the remuneration of public servants and teachers should be increased according to the actual price situation in various regions, and the minimum should be able to maintain the minimum living standard of a family of 15. The salary exceeding the minimum living expenses should be issued at a reduced rate. The proposal put forward by Jin Shaoxian and others is quite specific, the main points of which are that starting from October, the remuneration of public servants and teachers across the country should be issued in full in gold yuan, and daily necessities for consumption by each person and his or her family should be distributed on a monthly basis.

### Bullitt Dispatched to China to Investigate the Situation in China and the Situation of Aid to China; Scheduled to Depart on the 9th of Next Month and Return to the United States Around Christmas

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Former US Ambassador to France and the Soviet Union, William C. Bullitt, is scheduled to leave Washington for China on November 9th. Bullitt is going to China as a special consultant to the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation of Congress to investigate the urgent situation in China. The Congressional Oversight Committee on Foreign Aid announced today that the committee chairman, Bridges, had notified the committee that he had appointed Bullitt as a consultant. It was also stated that Bullitt is scheduled to go to China on the 9th of next month to investigate the situation there. Bullitt himself told a Central News Agency reporter that the committee had ordered him to go to China to "investigate the truth and examine the progress of the aid to China program." Bullitt refused to comment on his mission, saying only that it was not the time for him to express his views publicly, and that if he had any views, "he would provide them to the committee after the investigation is completed for report to Congress." He told reporters that he hopes to return to Washington around Christmas, but he refused to comment on the current military situation in China. Although committee officials and Bullitt himself refused to explain his mission to China, according to Congressional sources, in view of the fact that the situation in China has entered an emergency stage, the committee believes that it is necessary to send someone familiar with Chinese affairs to China for an on-the-spot investigation. This is a prerequisite measure for Congress to take further action on China. It is not surprising that Bullitt is entrusted with this important task, because he is one of the famous critics of the current China policy of the Democratic government. It is known to the world that Bullitt has constantly called for strengthening support for President Chiang in his speeches in Congress and in his articles published in various magazines so that he can resist the CCP. Just four days ago, Bullitt announced his break with the Democratic Party and his support for Dewey's presidential campaign. Bullitt criticized the Democratic Party's foreign policy for allowing the Communist Party to control China and Europe.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th, United Press] Bullitt, who is about to go to China to investigate, was originally a heavyweight in the Democratic Party, but he announced on the 24th of this month that he would support Dewey's presidential campaign. It is said that the main reason for Bullitt's change of heart is that he believes that the Truman administration is inept and incompetent, and is unable to protect American interests in Europe and China in the Cold War. Some observers speculate that Bullitt's mission to China may lay the foundation for a revision of China policy after the Republican Party comes to power. Bullitt told a United Press reporter that he would investigate every aspect of American aid to China. He also said that after returning to the country, he would submit a report directly to the committee. Bullitt had previously said that previous proposals to increase aid to China had been shelved by the State Department, and he said that he could not agree with the claim that the CCP had no relationship with the Soviet Communist Party. Bullitt has also strongly advocated sending MacArthur to China to plan a joint strategy with President Chiang, and advocated immediately strengthening military aid to China.

### The Total Value of Surplus Materials Obtained by Us Exceeds 400 Million US Dollars

The more than 3,000 bandits of the 8th Column who attacked Xiaoyaotou launched a fierce attack, taking our No. 2 pillbox after the National Army had just completed the change of guard at dusk, and then repeatedly surged towards the No. 1 and No. 3 pillboxes.

[Our Shenyang Office, 30th] Shenyang on the night of the 29th was full of stars, the sound of airplanes was rolling, the sound of tanks was thundering, the guns were loaded, and the cannons were loaded.

A naval official declined to comment on the possible withdrawal of the US Navy from Qingdao. They also remained silent about the number of US sailors and marines stationed in Qingdao.

### Xu Shiying States at the Legislative Yuan's Border Affairs Committee: Striving for Stability in Mongolia and Tibet, Planning to Resolve the Kham-Tibetan Boundary Issues

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Legislative Yuan's Border Affairs Committee secretly held a plenary committee meeting on the morning of the 30th. Over 30 committee members attended, chaired by Huo Zhanyi. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, was invited and, despite his illness, attended with senior officials of the commission to report and answer questions. Mr. Xu first explained the commission's policy guidelines, stating, "In this time of national crisis, we must strive for stability. Regarding Mongolia, we aim for stability by aligning with popular sentiment. Regarding Tibet, we aim for stability by maintaining the status quo." Subsequently, Yao Guangnai, the commission's chief secretary, reported on the commission's work, stating that the commission's central task regarding Mongolia was to assist various leagues and banners in their rehabilitation, providing subsidies and dispatching special commissioners to assist, which has achieved considerable success. Furthermore, many league and banner security forces have voluntarily assisted the National Army in suppressing the rebellion. As for Tibet, a rational and legal principle has been established regarding the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama. The Kham-Tibetan boundary issue is also being planned for negotiation and resolution. In addition, efforts are being made to recruit children from Tibetan aristocratic families to study in Nanjing, to send children from the border regions to study in Nanjing, and to request the Ministry of Education to establish special remedial classes to accommodate border region youths who cannot be admitted to schools. Mr. Yao's report lasted over 40 minutes. Mr. Xu then reported on the British relationship with Tibet over the past several decades and the process of requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to abolish the unequal treaties between India and Tibet, providing a very detailed account. He also stated, "After the implementation of the constitution, Tibetan representatives were elected to attend the National Assembly, and members elected from Tibet also participated in the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, all of which sufficiently proves Tibet's support for the central government." Subsequently, committee members Zhao Pei and Rong Zhao and others raised questions regarding various matters concerning Mongolia and Tibet, which were answered by Mr. Yao and the director of the Tibetan Affairs Office, respectively. Committee member Tan Qizang inquired about the Tibetan business delegation's trip abroad. Chairman Xu explained in detail the circumstances surrounding the Tibetan business delegation's trip abroad, stating, "When the delegation leader, Xia Kuba, left Nanjing, he stated that if foreign exchange settlement could not be arranged, they would go to India to negotiate the purchase of US dollars. If that failed, they would cancel their trips to the United States and the United Kingdom and return to Tibet from India. Therefore, our foreign affairs authorities only issued visas on their passports for going to India and did not issue separate passports for going to the United States. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Hong Kong, the delegation managed to go to the United States and made inappropriate remarks to American reporters while passing through San Francisco. After inquiries by our ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, and the consul-general in New York, Zhang, it was determined that the delegation members were unfamiliar with American customs and did not pay attention when speaking. The delegation leader, Xia Kuba, has asked Consul-General Zhang to telegraph me (Xu referring to himself) that the delegation will absolutely not discuss politics in the future." Mr. Xu then read aloud the original telegram from Consul-General Zhang. Finally, he stated that in handling Mongolian and Tibetan affairs, he has always adhered to the principle of "seeking trust with sincerity." If there is any legal responsibility to be borne for the Tibetan business delegation's trip abroad, he would absolutely be responsible. Although Mr. Xu is old and has not fully recovered from his illness, he gave his report and answered questions for more than an hour with great energy and sincerity. The committee members expressed their admiration and applauded warmly several times. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

### The Aftermath of the Gold Yuan

— Zhao Bo

The issuance of the Gold Yuan has caused great fluctuations for two months, putting pressure on people's lives and causing extreme anxiety. From late August to mid-September, people flocked to the Central Bank to exchange gold, silver, and US dollars for Gold Yuan, which was inspiring to see such patriotism. However, since late September, the mood has suddenly changed, with everyone scrambling to buy goods, starting in Shanghai and gradually spreading throughout the country. The difference is that the South has strong financial resources, and people are rushing to buy luxury and pleasure items, while the North is barren, and people are rushing to buy food, a necessity for survival. This is a significant and worrying sign for the future. Examining the Gold Yuan's issuance, at least four mistakes were made in concept:

(1) The Misconception of Reserve Funds: The financial authorities have repeatedly declared that the Gold Yuan has full reserves, as if this could strengthen people's faith. In reality, since the Gold Yuan cannot be redeemed or converted into foreign exchange, people are not too concerned with the adequacy of the reserves. The government, however, wanted to use this to show its credibility, actually storing gold and US dollars without using them, which was very unwise. Because the stability of the Gold Yuan, which is not redeemable, depends on the management of its issuance. The adequacy of the reserve funds is actually secondary.

(2) The Misconception of Maximum Issuance: Based on the amount of legal tender circulating before the war, the financial authorities set the maximum issuance of the Gold Yuan at 2 billion. This estimate made two mistakes: first, the circulation rate of legal tender before the war is not the same as the current circulation rate of the Gold Yuan; second, the people's confidence in legal tender before the war is not the same as the current confidence in the Gold Yuan. Not only are they not equal, but the circulation rate has actually accelerated, and the people's confidence in the currency system has weakened. This is a fact that we should not conceal. As a result, the Gold Yuan's issuance increased fivefold, and prices rose tenfold. This mentality of expecting prices to rise is definitely the Gold Yuan's fatal flaw.

(3) The Misconception of Collecting Gold, Silver, and US Dollars: The financial authorities very much wanted the people to hand in gold, silver, and US dollars to the Central Bank as foreign exchange deposits, but the result was not very ideal. More people requested to exchange gold, silver, and US dollars for Gold Yuan, and fewer people used them as foreign exchange deposits. This kind of fragmented gold and silver was originally a frozen savings in the hands of ordinary people, but now it has become floating capital, attacking the material side, and triggering a high tide of price increases. The higher the efficiency of the police, the more rampant the floating capital becomes, and Shanghai is a prominent example.

(4) The Misconception of Price Ceilings Without Purchase Limits: Price ceilings without purchase limits will inevitably lead to the phenomenon of goods escaping the system. Black markets are everywhere, and everything is hidden. It must be understood that limiting the price of individual items is useless. We must plan as a whole for the entire price mechanism to be effective. The connection of prices can be divided into three types: first, the front-to-back connection, that is, the price of raw materials and the price of finished products have a close connection. Second, the left-to-right connection, that is, the price of item A and the price of item B, whether they are competing items or complementary items, have a close connection. Third, the near-to-far connection, that is, the prices of goods in various regions often have a relationship of mutual generation and mutual restraint. If we do not understand the price mechanism of front, back, left, right, near, and far, and rashly impose price limits on individual commodities, we will rarely avoid failure. Therefore, whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, price limits without quantitative distribution cannot succeed. Therefore, I believe that the result of implementing price limits is that the rich can still enjoy themselves, while the poor cannot live, further increasing social inequality.

The course of this currency reform involved confidential matters, and it was difficult to consider everything comprehensively, so we can ask for the people's understanding. However, after two months of experimentation, many shortcomings have been discovered. The government should have the grace to admit its mistakes and correct them, adopting opinions from all sides. I personally believe that the seriousness of the current economic problems lies in the two "capital" characters of "floating capital" and "material." The way to save the situation should start from both sides.

1.  The Problem of Floating Capital: To dredge and reduce floating capital depends on sound financial policies. For the short term, the following things should be done: (1) The capital increase of banks should be implemented as soon as possible, which is an effective method of tightening funds and reducing floating capital. (2) Do not use the Gold Yuan to absorb fragmented gold and silver from the people again. (Of course, the government will accept large amounts of gold and US dollars deposited in the Central Bank as foreign exchange deposits or used to purchase public bonds by wealthy families), prohibit buying and selling only, and do not prohibit possession. Rather than exchanging gold and silver for the Gold Yuan and turning it into floating capital, it is better to hide wealth among the people and turn it into frozen savings, which is also a measure to reduce floating capital. (3) Banker's drafts issued by banks and deposits created by banks using lending methods should be strictly prohibited. Close attention should be paid to the business of the clearing house, which is also a necessary measure to reduce floating capital. (4) Arbitrary deposits of public funds for military and political expenses are extremely harmful. The use of public funds by military offices in major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin should be closely investigated. This is a major source of floating capital and must be strictly prohibited. (5) The most basic thing is of course the number of Gold Yuan issued and its circulation rate. The government can control the former itself, while the latter depends on the cultivation of people's confidence. If the issuance is limited, the circulation rate will naturally be normal, and floating capital will not flood the market.

The above points are all about reducing floating capital. Now, let's further examine the dredging of floating capital: (1) Selling surplus enemy and puppet materials, disposing of enemy and puppet real estate, selling shares of state-owned enterprises, and raising foreign currency public bonds are all good ways to absorb floating capital, and they should be vigorously promoted. However, because the currency value is unstable, the effectiveness is not great. (2) Scholarly institutions should be established to compile price indexes and issue index savings bonds, or use index methods to absorb index deposits.

2. The Problem of Materials: The problem of materials should follow the eight-character formula, that is, "utilize the land to its fullest potential, and facilitate the flow of goods." This year, Jiangnan has a good harvest, and there is no shortage of agricultural products, but traffic is congested and transportation is difficult, so there is no way to help each other. The situation in North China is even more serious. As winter approaches, the Hai River will freeze, so preparations should be made early for the transport of grain from the South to the North as a precautionary measure. For the short term, the following things should also be done regarding the issue of goods: (1) The price ceiling policy should be adjusted. For food, which is a necessity of life, it is advisable to retain price ceilings, but quantitative allocation must be achieved. As for other luxury and pleasure items, free markets should be restored, and there is no need to interfere. Currently, the prices of public utilities adopt a subsidy policy, which is not appropriate, because can the hard-working masses sit on airplanes, send telegrams, or make phone calls? Even tap water and postal services are not enjoyed by the masses. Therefore, the policy of public utilities must adopt a parity policy, based on cost. (2) To encourage and support production, "order loans" should be promoted, and the price should be set at a level that can maintain legitimate profits. (3) Efforts should be made to reduce the transportation costs of food and raw materials for life necessities. (4) Use part of the foreign exchange to purchase food and industrial raw materials from abroad to meet urgent needs.

If we can have ways to dredge floating capital and materials, then prices may be temporarily stabilized. However, to solve the problems of materials and floating capital, three basic conditions must be met: the victory of the war, the integrity of politics, and the deficit of the fiscal budget must never rely on issuance to make up for the gap.

### Korean Commission Recommends to the UN General Assembly that North and South Korea Reopen Negotiations, to Begin Before the Withdrawal of Occupying Forces, or Else Both Sides' Armies Risk Engaging in Civil War

[US Information Service, Paris Dispatch, 29th] The United Nations Korean Commission today issued a report arguing that the United Nations General Assembly should continue to express concern for the independence and unity of that country, and expressed regret over the current state of confrontation between North and South Korea. The report emphasized the need to establish procedures for peaceful negotiations between North and South Korea, stating that such negotiations should begin before the withdrawal of occupying forces, or else the opposing armies risk being forced to engage in civil war. Today's report is divided into two parts, the first part being signed in Seoul in July of this year, and the second part concerning the period since the May elections in South Korea, being signed at Songdo Lake two weeks ago. Some members of the eight-nation commission are currently here to assist the General Assembly in drafting a solution to the Korean issue, while its main committee remains in Seoul, believing that its work is not yet complete. The commission insists that it has always been concerned with the entire Korean peninsula, but pointed out that it has not been able to enter North Korea, which is occupied by the Soviet military administration, in contrast to the cooperative attitude shown by the American authorities in South Korea.

[Central News Agency, Songdo Lake Dispatch, 29th, United Press] The United Nations delegation to Korea today requested that the military occupation of Korea should continue until some procedure for 'peaceful negotiations' between North and South Korea can be established. The temporary delegation to Korea, composed of eight countries, stated that such a procedure is necessary before the military withdrawal of occupying forces abandons Korea to the despotic rule of opposing regimes, lest the armies of the opposing regimes fall into a mutually destructive war. The aforementioned report of the delegation submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in Paris has now been released at the same time. The report describes the various steps taken to establish a unified and independent government in Korea, and "attaches importance to the cruel reality of the division of Korea," therefore "recommends that the General Assembly continue to pay attention to the Korean issue, seek the full cooperation of all member states of the United Nations, and take other steps it deems appropriate to achieve the independence and unification of Korea."

He said: The United States seems to have abandoned the terms of Japan's surrender in Japan. Marshal MacArthur once called Japan "a bastion of democracy." If anyone truly believes that Japan, after three and a half years of occupation, has now become a strong democratic fortress, in my imagination, this person's thinking is really inappropriate. Some people call Japan "a democratic execution platform," and this name may be better, because it contains a double meaning. Davies said, why is there "a blanket of silence" surrounding the Japanese peace treaty? Will Japan be made the factory of Asia? He does not want to conclude a harsh and severe peace treaty with Japan, but advocates leveling the economies of the countries in the Pacific region. He said, if we industrialize Japan too quickly under American orders, we will create problems for the next twenty years. He also learned why Britain has no policy on China's Northeast. He said that China's Northeast is "the Ruhr of the Far East," and any industrial production by Japan that exceeds a certain standard of compensation must be allocated to China and Southeast Asia to improve the latter's economic level. He called on the House of Commons to study the matter and submit a report.

[Agence France-Presse, London Dispatch, 29th] When the British House of Commons debated the Japanese issue, Deputy Foreign Secretary Mayhew spoke on behalf of the government, saying: "We have been waiting for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan for a long time, but there is still no sign of an early treaty." Regarding Japan's recovery, Mayhew said: "Japan has been completely disarmed. As for the economy, Japan should have a sufficient industrial level to maintain a reasonable standard of living for the Japanese people and fulfill its compensation obligations."

### British Foreign Office Issues Statement Pointing Out Errors in Premier Stalin's Remarks: No Agreement on Berlin Issue Reached in Paris

[This Newspaper's Report] London Broadcast, 30th: Regarding Stalin's claim that a draft agreement on the Berlin issue was reached in Paris but was rejected by the Western powers, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office denied this at a press conference on the 30th. The spokesman said that the acting president of the Security Council, Bramuglia, had obtained Vishinsky's agreement to the draft, but it had not been agreed to by the United States, Britain, and France. He said that Stalin's remarks were aimed specifically at "newspaper readers who are unaware of the facts."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris Dispatch, 29th] Security Council President and Argentinian Foreign Minister Bramuglia told this agency's reporter that he believes the Berlin incident can still be resolved within the United Nations framework. Only minor differences separate the two sides, and the Berlin incident technically remains on the Security Council's agenda. The Security Council will reconsider the entire case after a considerable period of time. Bramuglia also said that the root of the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word "simultaneously" in the phrase "simultaneous lifting of the blockade and unification of the Berlin currency," so there are no insurmountable difficulties to prevent both sides from making concessions to each other. Bramuglia neither confirmed nor denied Stalin's claim that a preliminary agreement had been reached, but was later deemed invalid by the three Western powers, so the Soviet Union cast a veto.

### UN Orders Ceasefire in Northern Palestine; US Undecided on Policy Towards the Holy Land

[This Newspaper's Report] Paris Broadcast, 30th: The United Nations ordered Israeli and Arab forces, which ignited a war in the northern Holy Land on the 29th, to cease hostilities on the 30th. UN Holy Land Truce Observation Team Leader Brigadier General Lee Lai set noon on the 30th (Universal Standard Time) as the ceasefire deadline, but UN officials here said that both the Arab and Jewish sides have requested guarantees that the other side will comply with the ceasefire order. The order was simultaneously sent to Tel Aviv and Beirut, and it is not yet known whether it will be accepted. In the order, Lee Lai announced that both Lebanon and Israel must first cease hostilities before the issue of guarantees can be considered.

[United Press, Haifa Dispatch, 30th] Israeli forces launched a powerful offensive on the entire line in northern Palestine at midnight last night, attacking the positions of the Arab Liberation Army with aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles. The UN Truce Headquarters here announced that it is withdrawing from dangerous areas, and observers urgently telegraphed Paris to report that the scale of the war is exceptionally large. Press Officer Fisch said that the fighting is most intense in the ancient battlefields of the Crusaders, south of the Lebanese border along the Mediterranean coast. According to the latest reports, Kaukji's Arab army is under severe threat. Fisch said that Israel's goal seems to be to eliminate the salient positions of the Arab army, from which the Arab army has launched several incursions and made some gains. The war is becoming increasingly fierce, but there have been no reports of Jewish forces occupying land to date.

[United Press, Paris Dispatch, 30th] The United States is undecided on the Palestinian issue, causing deep suspicion and concern among UN diplomats. Currently, all countries are holding back, waiting for the results of the US presidential election. Some delegates even believe that even if the US election ends, the general chaos will not disappear. The situation has arisen due to a sudden shift in the US position. China and Britain have already proposed a motion that, if passed, would impose economic sanctions on Israel for violating the ceasefire order. The United States originally supported the Sino-British proposal, but at the last stage, it is reported that President Truman suddenly intervened, causing the US delegation to announce its withdrawal of support.

### Kong Lingpei's Passport Revoked Long Ago, Foreign Affairs Ministry Investigates Flight to US: True or False?

[This Newspaper's Report, 30th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches great importance to this newspaper's report on the 30th about Kong Lingkan's flight to the United States. After investigating the case in the Passport Section, it was discovered that the diplomatic passport that Kong applied for in 1930 under the name of Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was revoked last year. If he did not find a way to obtain another passport from our country's embassy or consulate during his stay abroad, then the person who left the country may be his younger brother, Lingjie. However, according to regulations, foreign embassies and consulates should notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before issuing a visa for a diplomatic passport, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still unaware of this matter. Therefore, it has telegraphed the Shanghai Office on the 30th to inquire with Northwest Airlines and the US Consulate General. As for the Huang who traveled with Kong, it is said that he is Huang Renquan, the younger brother of Huang Renlin, who once served as an attaché at our US Embassy. His diplomatic passport was revoked long ago, and he was recently appointed as a consultant to the New York Office of the Information Bureau, and obtained an official passport.

Furthermore, Liang Shiying, the manager of this city's Shishi Xinbao newspaper, wrote to say that yesterday's news about Kong Lingkan's flight to the United States published on page 4 of this newspaper is not true, according to what Mr. Liang knows.

### Indictment of Yin Shikun for Hoarding Grain, Claiming Open Auction Purchase

Rescheduled Trial, Defendant Released on Bail

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yin Baokun, indicted for hoarding 294 bags of flour (44 catties per bag) and five piculs of white rice at Guanglichang Warehouse, No. 69 Zhoujiazui Road, was tried by the District Court yesterday afternoon. In addition to Yin Binkun, who was in custody, Yin's father, Yin Shanshan, Yao Xiong-guan, representative of Ruihe Foreign Firm, Wang Kemin, chairman of the Auctioneers' Association, Gao Pin-san, the Jia head, and Yu Fudi, an auction merchant, were summoned to testify. The defendant argued that Guanglichang Warehouse was opened by his father, Shanshan, and specialized in auctioning various goods, including grain. He worked at the warehouse. In mid-August, it was reported that more than ten auction houses, including Dazhong, were commissioned by the Jianghai Customs to jointly auction a large quantity of rice and flour. On the 17th of the same month, he went to the designated Ruihe Foreign Firm and successfully bid for 339 bags of flour and 123 bags of white rice. Together with the 185 bags of flour and three bags of white rice transferred to the warehouse by Yu Fudi, a fellow merchant, after he successfully bid on the same day, after successive sales, there were still 194 bags of flour and five bags of white rice unsold when the police investigated, which was a misunderstanding. He further stated two points: (1) Guanglichang Warehouse and he personally were legally operating grain merchants; (2) The flour and white rice that he was accused of hoarding were purchased at open auction and had been stored in the warehouse for less than a month. After the witnesses testified one after another, the court decided to reschedule the trial. The defendant was allowed to provide a reliable guarantor.

### Underground Business Discovers Large Quantity of Alcohol Owner Flees in Fear, Trusts Someone to Bribe, Detained for Investigation

The 49th Squadron of the 10th Brigade of the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps discovered an "underground warehouse" in a newly built shed in Nanshi's Nanzhangjia Alley at 10:00 p.m. the night before last. It contained 500 gallons of alcohol. A certain Yi Youyang and his wife, sent by the Lizhong Winery at No. 924 Fuxing East Road, were guarding it without reporting their household registration. They then went to Lizhong Winery to investigate the clues. The responsible partner of the winery claimed that it belonged to Yang Rugao, the head of the Zhouyi Alcohol Shop at No. 67 Qingdao Road. The squadron leader Zhu Rixin and the section chief Ye Wangchao of the brigade headquarters, led cadres Wu, Mao, and Zhuge to investigate No. 67 Qingdao Road. Yang had already fled upon hearing the news. It was discovered that the shop was an "underground business" (not registered with the relevant authorities or joined the association) established within the Far East Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory. After examining the "underground account books," it was found that the shop disregarded government laws and regulations, and the sales prices exceeded the price limit by three times, engaging in black market activities.

Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., he had the audacity to ask his household guarantor, Yang Xiaoting, to take 5,000 Gold Yuan in bribes to the brigade headquarters to bribe the inspectors in an attempt to quash the case. Zhu Rixin, the squadron leader in charge of the case, Ye Wangchao, the section chief, and cadres Wu, Mao, Zhuge, and others, were not tempted by the money and immediately reported it to the brigade commander, who ordered their detention, along with the 5,000 Gold Yuan and the underground account books, and sent them to the police station for legal action, while also arresting Yang Rugao to bring him to justice. The team also discovered over three taels and five mace of gold bars hidden in the home of Feng Youcai at No. 66 Lane 5, Xiaonanmen Street yesterday. The team sent personnel to accompany the owner and the Baotzhang to the Central Bank to exchange them for Gold Yuan.

### Scalpers Rush to Buy Rubber Products Retailers Unable to Cope

Since the implementation of price controls in the rubber industry in this city on August 19th, the factory prices of various factories have generally been lower than before the war, so they have become the target of panic buying by the general public, creating a situation of supply falling short of demand. Although major factories such as Da Zhonghua, Zheng Tai, and Jiao Sheng are feeling panic about raw materials and high costs, they still maintain regular shipments. However, under the competition of customers from this city and other places, retailers are still unable to cope, and the stock is almost empty. The scalpers are even more rampant, finding out in advance which factories are shipping to which stores, lining up to wait, and rushing in to grab the goods as soon as they arrive. Store clerks cannot take care of everyone and cannot collect money, so they can only let them take the goods away. They even break the large glass windows and beat the store employees, which is not uncommon. The store owners are all complaining endlessly.

### Employees Facing Financial Difficulties May Be Granted Salary Advance Municipal Ferry Employees to Receive One Month's Salary Advance

[Our Newspaper's Report] The labor unrest at the Municipal Ferry Company has been mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. The employees originally requested a salary advance of 100 Yuan per person. Yesterday, it was preliminarily decided to grant a salary advance of one month's pay to all employees. Employees whose salaries are less than 50 Yuan will also receive an advance of 50 Yuan.

### The Method for Accumulating Points to Purchase Goods Needs to Be Improved Some People are Buying Purchase Certificates

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Material Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan distributes materials to public employees and teachers using a point accumulation purchase method. Based on purchase certificates, they can purchase goods at the Bureau's retail stores or designated sales stores. However, since its implementation, public employees and teachers have the name of priority but not the reality. Moreover, it is fundamentally difficult to buy goods, so there are not a few who complain. Yesterday, the reporter observed the actual situation and found that: (1) There are many people buying, it is crowded, and often people have to wait half a day and cannot buy one thing. The waste of time and energy is a pity. (2) There is a suspicion that the sales stores are colluding with the scalpers. Because someone in the city is openly offering 90 yuan to buy a three-month purchase certificate. This is enough to prove that although the purchase method stipulates that you must have your own ID card, after the scalpers buy the purchase certificate, they may collude with the sales stores and obtain materials without the original owner's ID card, and then sell them on the black market. (When the reporter went to a sales store to buy things yesterday, they did not ask to see the ID card.) For example, black markets such as ice cream powder and cocoa powder are sold for more than 20 yuan. (3) When public employees and teachers buy things, the sales stores either say that the goods are sold out or only offer a few inferior goods, which is also suspicious. For example, the Material Supply Bureau only distributed materials to sales stores the day before yesterday, but when the reporter went to a certain place to buy them yesterday morning, they saw only a small amount of inferior goods such as toilet paper on display. It is said that the situation in other places is also similar. (4) Most of the stores only have a few employees to deal with, and their actions are slow. They seem to be indifferent to the anxious waiting crowd outside the counter. The above points are believed to be felt by most public employees and teachers. The general hope is that the Material Supply Bureau can immediately improve them. The types and detailed quantities of each distribution of materials should be announced in the newspapers in advance to show credibility. Strict methods should be used to avoid corruption. The best way is to allow public employee and teacher institutions to purchase collectively from the bureau and then distribute them. In this way, the scalpers will have no way to operate, and the buyers can avoid the pain of queuing and not being able to buy.

### A Record of the Real Estate Industry Returning to Slump Lack of Construction Materials Many Requesting Revocation of Licenses

The real estate industry, which was thriving after the currency reform, is now returning to a slump. Two months ago, due to the stability of the currency, speculation subsided, and a large amount of floating capital targeted real estate. The amount of capital flowing in within two months reached 100 million Gold Yuan. Since this month, floating capital has flocked to South China and Hong Kong, with a few remaining in this city to grab materials. The popular real estate transactions have suddenly slumped. Recently, even those who sell have lowered prices, but there are few who inquire. There are several reasons for this phenomenon, but the difficulties in the industry itself, such as the extreme shortage of construction materials, are also important factors. It is heard that several people who have already obtained building licenses are applying for revocation because of this, and those who have started construction are stuck in suspension.

### Regulations for Applying to Build Low-Rise Buildings Standard Size Approved for Licensing

It is heard that the standard regulations have been reviewed and implemented by the Municipal Government.

### Alas, Over a Thousand Bags of White Rice Sink to the Bottom of the River with the Wooden Barge

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Bureau's Feixing ship towed two Sen barges loaded with over a thousand bags of rice from the China Merchants Bureau's Seventh Wharf at around 8:00 a.m. yesterday. The two wooden barges crashed into the wharf and were damaged, sinking completely to the bottom of the river. Fortunately, the boatmen escaped to the wharf, and no one fell into the water. Efforts are being made to salvage the sunken rice.

### China Merchants Bureau Dining Incident

[Our Newspaper's Report] Hundreds of boatmen and sailors of the China Merchants Bureau's small lighters were unable to buy rice and had no food to eat. They had requested the Bureau to find a way, but the Bureau had no solution for the major ships and employees within the Bureau. For example, the Hongzhang ship was delayed for one day because there was no rice. Therefore, it was difficult to cope with the rice for the small lighters. Yesterday afternoon, the boatmen and sailors went to the restaurant on the sixth floor to buy food. Since the rice panic, the restaurant had refused to sell to outsiders. Yesterday afternoon, the hall was occupied by the small lighter boatmen and sailors, causing problems for the Bureau's employees' lunch. Someone reported the situation to the authorities. As a result, the boatmen and sailors were supplied with lunch, and police fees were charged. The Bureau also promised to find a way to purchase rice, and prohibited them from going to the restaurant again next time. The incident was then resolved.

### Producing Areas Detain Grain Shipments, Resulting in Increasingly Scarce Rice Arrivals

Rice arrivals in the rice market yesterday were increasingly scarce, with no transactions taking place. This is because rice merchants' group purchases of about 20,000 piculs of rice in producing areas such as Qingpu, Kunshan, and Wuhu are still being detained by local governments. The Rice Trade Association has dispatched representatives to the Supervisory Office to report the difficulties in procurement, hoping that the authorities will send personnel to the producing areas with the rice merchants to negotiate with local governments to facilitate the flow of supplies.

Another report: Rice arrivals were low yesterday due to procurement difficulties, as some producing areas continue to block shipments, making it difficult to obtain supplies. Yesterday's arrivals reported in the city market were 279 piculs, and in the North City market 740 piculs, totaling 1019 piculs in both markets. The market price for white japonica rice was 20.78 yuan, and for milled indica rice 19.23 yuan. A few rice shops are supplying retail, with crowds of people vying to buy rice, creating a rather serious situation. No coarse grains were available yesterday, and soybeans were not allocated either.

[Our Dispatch] Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau said yesterday: Rice merchants in this city recently purchased over 27,000 bundles of rice from the surrounding areas, but less than 3,000 bundles were allowed to be transported out. The rest were detained by local governments. He has requested that Supervisor Chiang find a way to supervise the transportation to increase the rice supply in this city.

### Credit Extremely Tight, Daily Interest Reaches Fifteen Yuan

Credit is extremely tight. The daily interest rate yesterday (the 30th) hit a high of fifteen yuan, and it was still difficult to obtain funds. There is still a shortage of cash in the market. On the 29th, four banks did not balance their accounts until yesterday morning. The tightness of credit in the market is evident from this.

According to financial industry insiders: The reasons for the extremely tight credit are: (1) Price fluctuations are causing floating capital to shift towards goods, resulting in a sharp decrease in bank deposits. (2) Capital is flowing out, some escaping to Hong Kong, and some flowing to areas with relaxed economic controls to purchase goods. (3) Bank and business house capital increases require large amounts of funds, and loans cannot be recovered, resulting in no increase in deposits and loans, thus credit is extremely tight. In recent days, all banks and business houses have been cautious and have stopped lending, feeling extreme difficulty in their operations.

### Twenty-One Applications for Imports of Goods Ordered Overseas with Payments Already Made

According to the Import Control Commission: Among the currently open foreign exchange sources, applications for investment in production enterprises by overseas Chinese have become quiet. In addition, (1) in accordance with the Central Bank's Foreign Currency and Foreign Exchange Payment Regulations, those who transferred their foreign currency and foreign exchange to the Central Bank a month ago, and are applying for imports, there are already more than ten factories, including glass, cigarette, and leather industries. Only one application is from an individual. However, because all the forms are still being revised and printed, and the implementing rules of the Central Bank's Foreign Currency and Foreign Exchange Payment Regulations have not yet been approved, the commission needs to formulate review criteria to handle the import applications. Before these procedures are completed, applicants have been notified to postpone their applications. (2) According to the regulations for clearing imports of goods ordered overseas with payments already made, there have been twenty-one applications for imports. Among them, the procedures for three applications are complete, and there are no objections, so visa procedures can be completed immediately. For the remaining applications, the documents are incomplete and need to be supplemented before they can be approved.

### Two Banks and Business Houses Complete Capital Increase Procedures

The capital increase of various banks and business houses is being expedited. As of now, few have completed the capital increase procedures, reported to the Ministry of Finance, and deposited half of the funds in cash with the Central Bank. There are only one bank and one business house. The bank is the Four Banks Savings Association, and the business house is the Zhengxiang Business House. The Central Bank is waiting for notification from the Ministry of Finance to carry out inspection procedures. In addition, the Central Bank has approved the use of half of the cash deposited for capital increases by various banks and business houses since the 30th, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. If various banks and business houses have essential uses, they can be used at any time.

### The Sugar Market is Quiet

The sugar market was still sparse yesterday, with no transactions among dealers. Everyone is watching and waiting. The retail sales in this street have been supplied by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation since the previous day, which has slightly increased the supply, but due to restrictions, there are still many crowds.

### Tea Market Supply is Scarce

Since the main operators of black and green tea heard that the prices in Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other producing areas were soaring, and at the same time, because their stocks are about to be exhausted, the supply is scarce. Although buyers still favor it, it is even more difficult to get what they want. Transactions are declining, and the situation is uncertain.

It is reported that a large trading company in this city, which used to be far from being able to export tea, has now established a department to actively explore export opportunities. The person in charge of the department is already searching everywhere to prepare for future foreign sales.

### Although Tobacco Leaf Production Increased This Year, Manufacturers Still Find Procurement Difficult

Cigarettes are a major consumption item for citizens. Recently, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, manufacturers have found it difficult to continue production. Although tobacco leaf production has increased by about 30% this year due to favorable rainfall compared to last year, procurement is still difficult due to price limits and transportation issues. Currently, various cigarette factories mainly focus on the areas of Mingguang and Hankou as their main sources of raw materials. Among them, Mingguang and Fengyang have relatively abundant production and convenient transportation. The American tobacco leaves produced in Xuchang were originally gathered in Xuzhou, but recently the transportation from Xuzhou is not smooth, so they are mostly transported to Hankou via the Pinghan Railway. The price for medium-grade tobacco leaves in the producing area is 1.3 yuan, and the road to Guizhou is even longer, making the source even more scarce. The price is 1.6 yuan per pound. The tobacco industry in Kunming has long been famous, and the tobacco prices are also the most expensive. It is said that the price is about 2 yuan per pound. The cost of water transportation along the way is huge, so ordinary cigarette factories do not dare to take the risk.

### Silk Still Has No Transactions

Shengwei Foreign Firm wants to buy due to very good export prices, but the suppliers in the market are unwilling to sell, so no transactions have been made and the market is still cold.

Most of the silk wholesale merchants are holding onto their goods and not selling. Retail merchants still have a lot of goods from the first batch of distribution, and retail sales are limited, so the sales are still zero. However, the stock is still abundant. However, the rush to buy has not cooled down, and the general public is afraid that the price limits will be adjusted, so the entrances of various shops are still crowded.

### Finished Replicated Products for Export Can Be Exchanged with Cotton Mills for Cotton Yarn

The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Joint Operating Office used to have regulations for exchanging cotton yarn for finished replicated products such as undershirts, mattresses, blankets, towels, underwear, and handkerchiefs to promote export business. Now, because the conditions for cotton mills and replicated industries to allocate yarn have not been agreed upon and the quota has been temporarily suspended, and some replicated industries have been shut down due to the lack of raw materials, the office, in order to meet urgent needs, will accept applications for exchanging cotton yarn for replicated finished products that can be exported, and the terms of exchange can be negotiated individually.

Replicated Industries Raise Two Points

[Our Dispatch] According to a person in charge of a cotton yarn replicated industry, although the yarn and cloth exchange ratio has been discussed by the authorities for many days, no agreement has been reached yet. Currently, only the dyeing and weaving industries are in contact with cotton mills. The other ten replicated industries have not yet started negotiations.

He said: The replicated industries have provided two suggestions to cotton mills: (1) Cotton mills have stopped allocating yarn five times, and the shortage of yarn has reached 5,000 pieces. Now they want to borrow 3,000 pieces first to meet urgent needs. When the exchange ratio is determined in the future, they guarantee to return the finished products in full. (2) Yarn and cloth will be exchanged according to cost. One piece of 20-count yarn can be exchanged for 12 pounds of fine cloth or 28 and a half bolts. After exchanging according to this ratio, if there is still excess cloth in the winter, the government will purchase it at the limited price. However, these suggestions were not accepted by the cotton mills. In the past week, one-third of the replicated industries have stopped production due to a shortage of yarn. If the current situation continues, it is expected that the number of factories that will stop production will increase to more than one-half within this week.

Textile Construction Opens Cloth

The cotton cloth market continued to be closed yesterday. The Textile Lotus Company still opened as usual, but there were fewer types and colors. Only Leifeng Pagoda yarn was distributed, priced at 27 yuan per bolt, limited to (retail) purchase. In addition, second-class 40-yard 60-count gray cloth was priced at 25.66 yuan per bolt, limited to (dyeing factories and bed sheet industries) purchase. In addition, second-class bleached poplin was priced at 26.8 yuan per bolt, limited to (underwear) industry. Hongguang 8-pound raw-colored satin was priced at 28.3 yuan per bolt, limited to (umbrella) industry. No fine cloth in each grade was distributed today. In addition, there was US cloth 002-B3 printed cloth available, priced at 1 yuan per meter, limited to (retail) industry purchase.

Another report: The Joint Cloth Distribution organized by the Shanghai Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association has been held for four periods, with a total of 108,531 bolts and 2,409 yards distributed. As for the cloth sold by each factory itself, from August 20 to the 24th of this month, according to the reports of 167 members, it has reached 1.66 million bolts and 370,000 yards, 21,000 pounds. The sales figures of the remaining 300 members are being urged to be reported. Now, in order to enrich the supply of cotton cloth in this city, the association plans to continue to hold the fifth joint distribution. The detailed methods are being discussed. It is also learned that the association has been ordered to re-telegraph each factory to register their finished products, and the deadline is today (the 31st).

### Ministry of Education Distributes Books and Equipment, Over 150,000 Books and Equipment Valued at 110,000 Gold Yuan, to be Distributed by Provincial and Municipal Bureaus to Various Middle Schools for Use

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 30th] The Ministry of Education states that there are currently over 6,300 secondary schools nationwide, which is double the number from ten years ago. In order to improve the quality and supplement the loss of books and equipment during the war, the Ministry has allocated 200,000 Gold Yuan in the second half of this year to strengthen the book and equipment facilities of secondary schools nationwide.

### Prelude to the American Election (7): Thomas Criticizes Wallace

— Special Correspondent in the US, Mao Shuqing

[Report from New York, 21st of the month] Henry Wallace is the most eye-catching figure in this election. American youth are deeply interested in Wallace. Two weeks before the election, Wallace's student supporters at Columbia University were on the streets of New York in groups of twos and threes, giving campaign speeches for Wallace. Once, I was passing by the corner of 116th Street at Columbia University, and a student pinned a corsage on my lapel with the slogan "Elect Wallace" on it. I was immediately displeased and quickly pulled it off. The student glared at me with sharp eyes, and I quickly explained, "I am not an American citizen; I have no right to vote; and I don't even know who 'Ye-lai-shi' is!" After saying that, I ran away.

A 28-Year History on the Campaign Stage

In the American election arena, no one criticizes Wallace more profoundly than Norman Thomas. Thomas is the leader of the American Socialist Party. The United States also has a so-called "Socialist Party," which is probably rarely heard of domestically. In fact, this Mr. Thomas has participated in six previous American presidential elections, and this year is his seventh. Calculated at once every four years, Thomas has been on the American campaign stage for twenty-eight years. Though defeated, he is honored, and he does not dwell on success or failure. In August of this year, Thomas wrote a lengthy article in the American magazine "The New Leader," saying that although the Socialist Party's election campaigns have always ended in defeat for the past twenty-eight years, the Socialist Party's struggle has been successful because the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States have pilfered many of the Socialist Party's basic proposals in their platforms and policies, such as labor welfare, social insurance, and so on. He also said that a political party should not be proud of whether it is in power or not, but should focus on the implementation of its platform and policies. Therefore, he believes that the struggle of the past twenty-eight years has not been in vain.

An Intelligent Idealist Too Unaware of Reality

Thomas predicts that Dewey will win this year's election. He says that Wallace's "forward" thinking is not without reason, and he believes that Wallace is a very intelligent idealist but too unaware of the reality of the Soviet Union and Stalin. Thomas says that Wallace is most confident in his relationship with the Soviet Union. If he were to take office, the most difficult thing for him would be his relationship with the Soviet Union. Thomas's conclusion is ingenious: "Capable politicians, such as Beneš and Masaryk, are helpless against the Communist Party, let alone you, Wallace!"

From Thomas's perspective, Wallace is like Zuo Shunsheng looking at Zhang Junmai; they are "colleagues," so they see things more profoundly.

New and Small Parties Do Not Easily Achieve Victory

In the previous dispatch, the reporter gave a brief introduction to the complex election system in the United States. Because the election laws of each state are different, it is not easy for new and small parties to gain a foothold, let alone win the election. For example, in New York State, the election law stipulates that if a political party wants to participate in the presidential and vice-presidential elections, it must first have 12,000 people sign an application. After review and approval, the names of the candidates can be included in the printed ballot. So far, there are six parties competing for the presidency on the New York State ballot: the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, Wallace's Progressive Party, Thomas's Socialist Party, and two others: the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party, which is participating in the election for the first time this year and has obtained 21,900 signatures; their presidential candidate is Dobbs. There is also the National Industrial Government Party, with 18,500 signatures; their presidential candidate is Teichert. The Southern Jeffersonian Democratic Party has not registered in New York, and small parties and factions registered in New York State may not necessarily be able to register in several southern states. Only major parties with a history are truly national in scope and have a chance of winning.

Even If They Get Popular Votes, It's Difficult to Get Electoral Votes

The American two-party system maintains the federal system, and the federal system also protects the strong two-party system. Recently, Wallace returned from a campaign trip in the Midwest and gave a speech saying that he was determined to establish the foundation of the Progressive Party and make it a strong and permanent political party. That is his "wishful thinking." The American presidential election is a "federal electoral system." Authoritative observers believe that Wallace may get many popular votes in the primaries, but he will not get the electoral votes of the states. This view is generally correct. In the 1944 election, in the popular vote, Roosevelt got 55 percent and Dewey got 45 percent. But calculating the electoral votes of each state, Roosevelt got 84 percent and Dewey got only 16 percent. The former ratio only represents the common public opinion of the United States, while the latter ratio is the legally determined outcome. Wallace's new party may show some achievements in terms of public opinion, but in terms of legally determined victory or defeat, he will inevitably face a disastrous outcome! (From Upper New York)

### Prison Destroyed by Gale, Fifty Prisoners Die in Liujiang

[Report from Guilin, 30th of the month] Liuzhou Dispatch: At 3:00 PM on the 29th, the Liujiang County Prison was destroyed by a gale, killing 50 prisoners and injuring more than 90.

### Panic About Grain in Jiaxing, Public and Educational Personnel Request Payment in Kind

[Report from Jiaxing, 29th of the month] Rice stores in the urban area have no goods to supply for retail sales. Every day, people grind rice at the joint distribution center, with each person limited to buying one sheng. Cries and pleas for help are often heard. Furthermore: Public and educational personnel are panicking due to the grain shortage. Queueing to buy rice is also difficult. They have petitioned the county government to have their salaries paid in kind on a monthly basis. County Magistrate Pan has agreed to try to allocate rice from the sealed grain stocks for November. Starting in December, a portion will be distributed in advance. Also: Elementary school teachers in the urban area have sent more than ten representatives to petition the county government, requesting that their salaries continue to be paid in kind starting in November, as was the previous practice. Because the county magistrate went to Hangzhou, they did not get their request granted.

### Fang Jiling's Sentence Overturned, Jiangsu High Court Ordered to Investigate Files

[Report from Suzhou, 30th of the month] Fang Jiling, the former magistrate of Jiangyin County, colluded with Xu Jiechang, the former secretary of the Field Grain Office, and others during his tenure to commit fraud and profit from it, amounting to more than 800 million yuan. He was previously sentenced to ten years in prison by the Wudi Court. Fang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court, which has now overturned the sentence. Recently, someone secretly reported to the Presidential Office that Fang bribed a Wu clerk of the High Court who had already left his position with 20 large gold bars to buy his way out of the crime. The Presidential Office has now issued an order to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to forward it to the Jiangsu High Court to submit all the files of the case for review and investigation.

### Taihing Tax Collection Office Director Lü Jianming Accused of Fraud, Embezzling 60,000 Gold Yuan in Taxes

[Report from Taihing, 30th of the month] It is reported that Lü Jianming, the director of the Taihing Tax Collection Office of the Jiangyin National Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, took advantage of the opportunity during the recent adjustment of liquor taxes to secretly purchase tax certificates and tax stamps. He filled out the receipts for Bilu City Tianxing Bridge and other places where the rural stations are located, pre-dating them in an attempt to conceal the amount of fraud, which totaled more than 3,000 dan of local wine, embezzling about 60,000 gold yuan in taxes. He loaded the goods onto more than 20 large and small private boats and rushed to transport them out of the territory. After this news was revealed, it caused a great uproar in the city. Now, Chang Mujun, Ding Bingkun, and others in the county have separately submitted reports to the government authorities, requesting an investigation.

### The Home of Silk

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Report from Hangzhou, 28th of the month] When one mentions Chinese silk, one thinks of the silk-producing areas of Hangjiahu. However, among the three producing areas of Hangjiahu, Hu Province should be the first to be called the home of silk. In Hu Province, mulberry and acacia trees are everywhere. There are wooden looms for weaving silk in both rural villages and towns. In its heyday, there were eight or nine thousand silk looms, and the sound of looms could be heard far and wide. Silk was sold both domestically and abroad. However, since the invention of rayon internationally, the silk industry in China has been affected. The silk industry in Hu Province has gradually declined, especially since foreign countries require standard silkworm silk and standard silk fabrics, which has severely impacted the silk fabrics woven with native silk in most parts of Huzhou.

Currently, the state of the silk weaving industry in Wuxing is as follows: The autumn silkworm cocoon harvest is about 150,000 zu. Most of this entire harvest is reeled into native silk. In Wuxing, a silk weaving industry trade association has been established, including 13 formal silk factories. These 13 silk factories have about 500 looms. In addition, there is a type of machine weaving, which is scattered weaving households, with one or two looms per household, up to six or seven looms. Currently, there are more than 100 of these weaving households, with about 1,000 looms. Most of these weaving households weave silk fabrics with native silk, while silk factories weave silk fabrics with factory silk.

Huzhou crepe, which was once famous domestically, has not been woven for a long time. It is said that the non-weaving of Huzhou crepe is a natural elimination. There is also the famous Huzhou spun silk, but there is no such name now. Most of them have switched to weaving Xiangyun gauze and the like because Huzhou spun silk is laborious to weave and not very popular.

Currently, about 10,000 people in Wuxing rely on the silk weaving industry for a living, compared to about 50,000 before the war. Thus, it is about one-fifth of what it was before the war. The reporter visited the Dachang Silk Factory, which is relatively large in scale. Dachang has 89 machines, with a 50-horsepower power engine. Most of them are electric machines for weaving silk fabrics. The types woven there include pure silk and rayon blended fabrics, pure silk fabrics, and native silk and pure silk blended fabrics. Among them, pure silk and rayon blended fabrics and pure silk fabrics are sold to the United States, while native silk and pure silk blended fabrics are sold domestically. This type of shuttle weaving of two types of silk is called "interwoven." There are a total of three factories that do this type of interwoven weaving. Most of Dachang's machines were made in 1923, so they are not particularly new, but a factory with a scale like Dachang is one of the best in Wuxing. This is because it not only weaves silk fabrics but also has silk reeling equipment. It can be said that the entire process from silk cocoon to finished silk fabric is complete. Originally, it also had a dyeing section, but after dyeing in Wuxing, the colors would change immediately after exposure to sunlight or rain. Now, the raw materials for the colored silk used to weave the two-color silk fabrics are all from Shanghai. The reporter asked why they don't find ways to improve their own dyeing. They said, "The dyes still have to come from Shanghai. It is quite troublesome to transport them back and forth, so it is much easier to transport the colored silk."

In the past, silk used to account for a large part of China's annual export figures. Now it appears desolate and deserted. We hope that the silk industry in Wuxing will rejuvenate and take the lead in restoring its former glory.
