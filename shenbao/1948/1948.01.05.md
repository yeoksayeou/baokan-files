### The Soviet Union's Attitude Towards the Japanese Peace Treaty Remains to Advocate a Special Foreign Ministers' Conference; Molotov Replies to China's Suggestion; CCP Representatives Go to Khabarovsk to Attend Soviet Military Conference

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 4th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated in a note to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang on the 30th of last month: "Only the Foreign Ministers' Conference has the authority to prepare the Japanese Peace Treaty." Mr. Molotov suggested that other member states of the Far Eastern Commission could participate in the Foreign Ministers' Conference, following the precedent of the work on the German Peace Treaty, and the work of possible committees and subcommittees, as well as meetings regarding information consultation. The aforementioned note was in response to Minister Wang's note of the 5th of last month. According to China's note, it was pointed out that the Far Eastern Commission should undertake the main work of the Japanese Peace Treaty.

[United Press, London, 4th] Moscow Radio broadcast widely today stating: The Soviet Union has separately notified the United States, Britain, and China, reiterating its suggestion to convene a special four-nation Foreign Ministers' Conference this month to draft the Japanese Peace Treaty. The 1945 Potsdam Conference clearly stipulated that the four-nation Foreign Ministers' Conference of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union has the authority to draft the Japanese Peace Treaty. The Soviet government, in view of China's opinion on the Potsdam Agreement, believes that a supplementary statement is necessary. According to the Potsdam Agreement, the Foreign Ministers' Conference for drafting the peace treaty should be organized by representatives dispatched by the member states that signed the instrument of surrender with the relevant enemy country. Accordingly, although China did not participate in drafting peace treaties with former enemy countries in Europe, it should be on the list of invitees this time. However, the Chinese government's claim that the Far Eastern Commission's authority has a direct relationship with the Japanese Peace Conference cannot be considered sufficiently justified in light of the Moscow Agreement of December 1945. According to the Moscow Agreement, the preparation work for the Japanese Peace Treaty should be handled by the four-nation Foreign Ministers' Conference of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. Therefore, the four countries signed the instrument of surrender in Japan, and these countries' special concern for post-war Japan issues was recognized by the Moscow Agreement of December 1945. As for other countries of the Far Eastern Commission, they can participate in special committees and subcommittees. This method is sufficient to ensure that the interests of these countries will not be ignored.

[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] Shenyang cabled today stating: Northeast CCP leaders Lin Biao and Li Lisan have flown to Khabarovsk to attend a conference initiated by the Soviet Far East Command to discuss the exchange of daily necessities and Soviet weapons and ammunition seized by the Communists in the winter offensive. According to this, a military spokesperson declared: Although the authorities have not received this report, the Communists will not hesitate to take any steps to achieve their goals, even selling the Northeast to foreign countries. It is heard that Li Lisan's mission has three points: Exchanging daily necessities seized by the Communists in the winter offensive for Soviet weapons and ammunition, and requesting the Soviet Union to provide the Communist side with unlimited supplies of various military needs in the future. Obtaining Soviet equipment to organize a mechanized army. Proposing a spring offensive plan, with the ultimate goal of occupying the entire Northeast.

### Mao Zedong Criticizes the United States; Reports on the CCP's Ten Operational Plans

[United Press, San Francisco, 1st] CCP leader Mao Zedong submitted a report of 10,000 words to the Central Executive Committee of the party on December 25th. The CCP radio station broadcast the first part today, and the remaining parts will be broadcast continuously within three days. He stated: The United States is guiding the counter-revolutionary war "to deal with the independence of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people." The CCP army is adopting a full-scale offensive, which "will surely make the hundreds of millions of people oppressed by imperialism in the Eastern Hemisphere rejoice and be encouraged, and will also be a kind of support for the oppressed nations in some countries in Europe and the Americas." Mao also reported on the CCP army's ten operational plans, the content of which focuses on concentrating forces, breaking through key points, avoiding occupying any large cities, and waiting for the future. The CCP radio station broadcast the second part of the report submitted by Mao Zedong on the 2nd, stating: The CCP is carrying out party purification, eliminating unstable elements in key positions. These unstable elements mixed in when the number of Communist Party members expanded to 2.7 million between 1937 and 1947, including landlords and hired peasants, who controlled rural areas, party and government organs, and public bodies, oppressed the people, distorted party policies, causing these organs and public bodies to become detached from the people, and making it impossible to implement rural reform plans. Red Army soldiers also need to be reorganized and purified.

[United Press, San Francisco, 3rd] According to Mao Zedong's New Year's address intercepted here on the evening of the 3rd (broadcast on the Shanbei radio station), he criticized the United States for preparing for war and planning to launch a third world war in the near future to defeat democratic forces.

To Overcome Current Financial Difficulties, Strict Price Controls Are Necessary; Minister of Finance Yu Reports to the Senate Standing Committee

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The national budget for the 36th year has a huge gap between income and expenditure. The total amount of expenditure is more than 930 billion yuan, which is four and a half times the original budget. The total amount of revenue is about 130 billion yuan (the original budget was more than 70.3 billion). Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun attended the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee today and reported on recent financial measures. He emphasized that to overcome current financial difficulties, it is necessary to strictly control prices, increase sources of income, and increase national treasury revenue. He also pointed out that the reason why the budget cannot be balanced is because the Communists destroyed transportation, blocked freight, and hindered production, which caused price fluctuations and currency inflation, which cannot be stopped immediately. Moreover, the military needs during the chaos are huge, and the salaries of civil servants have been adjusted repeatedly, which has increased expenditures. Therefore, the increase in various taxes is far less than the rapid rise in prices. He also stated that in the total revenue of the 36th year, tax revenue was more than 90 billion yuan, accounting for 68% of the total revenue. In addition to tax revenue, the revenue was more than 28 billion, and the public debt revenue was more than 13 billion. (Continued on page 2, left corner)

### Congratulating the Birth of the Republic of Burma, Hoping for a New Beginning in Sino-Burmese Relations

Burma officially declared its independence on the fourth of this month. The free Republic of Burma was born on this auspicious occasion. China and Burma are closely connected geographically and have always been brotherly nations. As Burma achieves independence, our country, in addition to sending Vice Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao as a special envoy to offer congratulations, leaders of the government, including Chairman Chiang, have sent telegrams to the President, Prime Minister, and Foreign Minister of Burma to express their congratulations. This newspaper has always sympathized with and valued the Burmese people's struggle for independence and freedom, and is particularly concerned about the future Sino-Burmese relations. Today, Burma has achieved independence and reaped abundant fruits. We extend our most sincere congratulations and express our boundless joy for the rebuilding of Sino-Burmese relations. 1948 is a happy year for Southeast Asia. We firmly believe that in the future, China and Burma will live in good neighborliness and continue to unite strongly, dedicating themselves to the reconstruction of Asia and working together to seek the happiness of mankind.

Burma is located in the western part of the Indochinese Peninsula, bordering the Bay of Bengal to the southwest. The entire territory is divided into Upper Burma and Lower Burma: Upper Burma connects to Yunnan and Xikang in China, facing the northeast of the country; Lower Burma borders Siam to the east and India to the west. The mountains are purely the remaining veins of China's Hengduan Mountains; the Irrawaddy River originates purely from the highlands of Kangzang. Burma's mountains are the remaining veins of China, and Burma's waters are tributaries of China. The friendly relations between Burma and China in history, if not predetermined by fate, how could the soil be so connected, the terrain so similar, and the bloodlines so flowing, with such intimacy! The songs of China, when heard by the Burmese, are pleasing and touching. Burmese customs are close to those of the Chinese, like the clothing of brothers. Every time we browse Burmese and Chinese books, we feel a longing and lingering emotions for the ancient stupa of Shwemawdaw Pagoda, the great Shwedagon Pagoda of Yangon, the reclining Buddha of Thanlyin, the wide port of Pathein, as well as the old site of Bago and the hot springs of Dawei. The geographical features, culture, customs, and so on of China and Burma are so closely related and similar, which is by no means an accidental formation, but a demonstration of the intertwined fates and shared concerns of thousands of years.

Sino-Burmese relations have a glorious history of three thousand years, which is evident in historical records. General Sino-Burmese historical books and illustrated records not only contain glorious records, but also magnificent songs, leaping onto the paper. According to historical texts and evaluations, Sino-Burmese relations began in the ninth year of Yongyuan in the Later Han Dynasty (97 AD) and were interrupted in the twelfth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1886 AD), a total of 1,789 years. What preceded this is unverifiable, and what followed belonged to the relations between China and Britain. The most unfortunate thing is that the Sino-British negotiations on the dispute over the Yunnan-Burma border still have an undetermined section, which has become a pending issue. Although Sino-Burmese relations were interrupted for sixty years, the joint fight against Japan by China and Burma during these sixty years can be regarded as the prelude to the revival of direct Sino-Burmese relations. During the war, the wartime capital of our country, Chongqing, was visited by a Burmese delegation, which brought profound friendship. Subsequently, with the establishment of the Sino-Burmese Cultural Association, the national diplomatic activities of the two countries have never been interrupted and have increased daily. These facts show that Sino-Burmese relations have become deeper due to the long history of the past and the joint fight against Japan. This time, after the Anglo-Burmese agreement was signed, the two governments simultaneously exchanged ambassadors, symbolizing the rebuilding of Sino-Burmese relations, which has a history of friendly love and far-reaching origins. We are very pleased that the direct Sino-Burmese relations, which had been interrupted for sixty-one years, have been re-established. Today, Burma has completed its great cause of independence, and our joy is the same as that of the Burmese people. We are even more convinced of the consolidation of Sino-Burmese relations in the future.

The unresolved Yunnan-Burma border issue in the history of Sino-British negotiations is the misfortune of Sino-British historical relations. We do not want this unfortunate border dispute to continue to constitute unhappiness between China and Burma. Therefore, we hope that when Sino-British relations are harmonious, Britain should voluntarily retreat from the occupied areas on the Yunnan border to eliminate the old evils in history. We especially hope that on the day the Sino-Burmese border line is demarcated, the Hukawng Valley, where Chinese troops shed blood, and the Jiangxinpo, which was invaded in the past, will no longer be included in the Burmese territory. We believe that the enlightened British government and the wise leaders of Burma will surely remember the glorious achievements of our Expeditionary Force in Burma during this war, which will be recorded in history. The Battle of Saokji, the Battle of Toungoo, and the Battle of Yenangyaung were fought to cover the retreat of the British army, and our Expeditionary Force was besieged, and Division Commander Dai Anlan died as a result. Two years later, our army launched an attack from India again, re-entering Burma, and defeated the stubborn Japanese invaders in the Hukawng Valley and the Mogaung Valley, opening up the China-India Highway and restoring half of Burma's territory. The mountains and rivers stained with the blood of Chinese men contributed to the noble friendship between China and Britain and between China and Burma. The reason why we recall this is not to demand any rewards, but only to hope that the Chinese border areas invaded by the British army in the past should be returned to China in accordance with the law and facts, so as to determine the natural boundaries of our southwestern frontier. British politicians, especially the enlightened leaders of the Labour government, have foresight and achievements, and are expected to break with tradition and create new ways for the new Sino-British relations after the war. The new Burmese nation is not short of far-sighted people. When Burma is established and reborn, we are even more convinced that rational and ambitious Burmese politicians will surely repay their good neighbors with joy.

We celebrate the independence of Burma and the birth of the Republic of Burma, and hope that the Sino-Burmese relations, which have been interrupted for sixty-one years, will have a new beginning and a new creation from the auspicious day of yesterday (the 4th), paving the way for peace and happiness in Southeast Asia.

Hu Shih's Thoughts

In addition, Hu Shih, President of Peking University, after recovering from a minor illness, expressed his feelings about the implementation of the Constitution. He emphasized that this Constitution is more sound than past charters, constitutions, and interim laws, but he believes that there are various difficulties in the implementation of certain articles in this law. Government personnel at all levels must study the Constitution in detail and immediately make all preparations for its implementation in order to overcome the difficulties. He went on to say: Some of the absolute provisions in the Constitution are a progressive fundamental law. Hu Shih also praised the progress of the provisions on the rights and obligations of the people in the second chapter of the Constitution. He believes that the provisions of Article 8, "1. The court shall not refuse the people's request for habeas corpus; 2. It is not allowed to request the arresting agency to explain and answer first; 3. The arresting agency shall not refuse or delay the habeas corpus; 4. Violation of the above three points is a crime" and Article 172 stipulates that "Orders that conflict with the Constitution or laws are invalid" are important features. He said: The government and the people should study and understand the various provisions in detail. The government should ask the National Assembly to make a limited-term reservation for the points that are difficult to implement, and the people must know the contents of the Constitution in order to obtain their due rights and fulfill their obligations. Hu Shih repeatedly emphasized: The government must have 100% patience in the implementation of the Constitution. Hu Shih also talked about other issues, such as the president's rights, the powers of the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, the ideals of the chapter on basic national policies, compulsory education for school-age children, and 15% of the total budget for education expenditures. His conclusion said: Although some provisions cannot be implemented immediately due to the limitations of material time and the government's preparations, they can all be achieved. At the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, at the time of the New Year's renewal, it is hoped that the whole country will thoroughly implement it.

### Mao Zedong's Report

(Continued from the first page) Mao Zedong said: American imperialism is now establishing a plan to enslave the world, and it is jumping into various parts of Europe and Asia like a beast, organizing the reactionary forces of various countries into an imperialist anti-democratic front to attack all democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union.

He also said: The democratic forces of the whole world must defeat this plan, and they will surely be able to defeat this plan. The strength of the world anti-imperialist camp has now exceeded the strength of the imperialist camp. The advantage is on our side, not on the enemy's side. The anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has been formed. The socialist Soviet Union is rising, and there is no economic panic. It is also supported by the vast masses of the world, so its strength has exceeded that of the imperialist United States, because the United States is declining, and it is seriously threatened by economic panic, and it is opposed by the vast masses of the world. The new democratic countries in Europe have strengthened their unity at home and established contact with each other abroad. The anti-imperialist forces of the people in the capitalist countries in Europe, led by France and Italy, are now growing. The people of Latin America are no longer entirely obedient slaves of the United States. The entire Asia has risen with national liberation movements. The communist parties of nine European countries have issued a declaration calling on the people of the world to join the battle and rise up to resist imperialism. This call to battle has inspired the oppressed people of the world, pointed out the direction of struggle for them, and strengthened their confidence in victory.

Mao Zedong's broadcast clearly told the world that once the party's basic program is realized, the CCP intends to establish a "firm leadership" of the united front to govern China. The CCP is now following its political line of "developing progressive forces, overcoming intermediate forces, and isolating diehards." He asked in an eloquent tone: "Can the United States really continuously provide a large amount of assistance to the reactionary parties in various countries? No. Although the economic strength of American imperialism has increased during World War II, it is now facing instability and reduction in domestic and foreign markets. If it is reduced again, it will cause an economic panic to break out. The wartime prosperity of the United States is only a temporary phenomenon. The strength of the United States is only artificial. Once an economic panic breaks out, it will be like a volcano threatening the American imperialism that is now sitting on a volcano."

His conclusion was to denounce pessimism, saying: "We must eliminate all weak and incompetent ideas in our camp. All views that overestimate the enemy's strength and underestimate the people's strength are wrong. We should firmly believe that there are many difficulties and obstacles ahead. If we can grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism, we will surely be able to overcome the difficulties and defeat the enemy."

He said: Capitalism is heading for extinction, and socialism and democracy are heading for victory.

He simulated the sentence of British wartime Prime Minister Churchill to end his lengthy 10,000-word report: "The light of dawn is already in front of us, and we should strive forward."

### Li Jishen Leads Reactionary Organization in Hong Kong

[United Press, Hong Kong, 3rd] Nationalist Party traitors led by Li Jishen announced on the 3rd the establishment of the "Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party." They have been meeting in Hong Kong for two weeks, and now they have published a lengthy declaration, signed by Feng Yuxiang (now in the United States), Cai Tingkai, He Xiangning, Tan Pingshan, Liu Yazi, etc. (all of the above are in Hong Kong).

This harshly worded declaration recounts the history of the party since Sun Yat-sen founded it in 1924, and then criticizes it, saying: Twenty years have passed, and Sun Yat-sen's will has not yet been realized. The declaration calls for the implementation of Sun's Three Principles of the People, but in view of the changes in the past twenty years, it is also necessary to make some revisions:

"We must unite with nations that treat us equally" should add "Unite with the Soviet Union."

"The Chinese democratic parties unite" includes: the Communist Party and the Democratic League.

"Tillers have their mountains, and workers have work to do."

The declaration also calls for "anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism." It is said that this is inseparable from the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, because "American reactionaries intend to destroy China."

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 2nd] Save the Country Association leader Shen Junru and Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Party leader Zhang Bojun today jointly issued a notice calling for the Chinese Democratic League to hold its third plenary meeting in Hong Kong on the 5th of this month. By then, except for Chairman Zhang Lan and Luo Longji, the remaining representatives are said to be prepared to attend. The meeting will be secret, but a declaration will be issued at the closing ceremony.

### Minister of Finance Yu's Report at the Conference

(Continued from Page 1) Mr. Yu continued his report on the actual situation of the four major pillars of national tax revenue: customs duties, salt tax, direct tax, and commodity tax, stating:

Last year's customs revenue was over 2.2 trillion; exceeding the original budget by more than 300 billion. However, under the current import trade management, due to strict restrictions on certain imported goods, while encouraging exports and striving for foreign exchange, and granting tax-free exports for certain goods, the tax base is not easily prosperous. Furthermore, the smuggling problem is extremely serious, with over 18,000 smuggling cases and confiscated smuggled goods amounting to over 155 billion yuan. We are currently negotiating with the Hong Kong government to draft an assistance agreement for combating smuggling, which should be signed soon.

The total budgeted salt tax revenue was over 530 billion, but as of mid-December, over 1 trillion has already been collected. 200,000 tons of salt were shipped to Japan in exchange for domestically produced equipment. Although the salt tax rate was adjusted twice last year, the current tax rate is only 50% of the pre-war level.

Direct tax revenue, originally budgeted at over 940 billion, will exceed this figure by the end of the year. Mr. Yu also reported that the Ministry of Finance has already drafted a plan regarding the levy of property tax, which will be implemented upon approval by the State Council.

Commodity tax revenue, originally budgeted at over 1.8 trillion, has actually reached over 3.7 trillion. However, the commodity tax is levied ad valorem, and its implementation is not thorough. If the tax amount is too high, it will hinder production, and if it is too low, it will affect tax revenue. In the future, we should strive to balance both. Mr. Yu continued to emphasize the extreme importance of reorganizing the tax system. In recent years, we have strived to improve the tax system and reduce the size of the organization. In the 36th year, over 7,000 tax personnel were dismissed, and a strict examination system was implemented to raise the standard of talent. He also stated: I cannot guarantee that tax personnel will not be corrupt, and those found will be punished. Last year, 257 people were dismissed for corruption, 68 were dismissed, 59 were suspended, and 7 were wanted. He continued to point out that many tax personnel are also able to work diligently and selflessly. Mr. Yu then described the revenue other than taxes, such as the situation of public debt revenue and material revenue, stating: The sales of US dollar short-term treasury bills and US dollar bonds were not satisfactory last year, due to high prices and the fact that bond interest was not as good as market profits. Regarding local finances, the total expenditure of provinces and cities throughout the year was over 2.6 trillion, with over 2.1 trillion subsidized by the central government. Temporary expenditures in various regions have increased sharply due to the war with the communist bandits. Mr. Yu continued to report on the financial facilities situation, briefly stating: In order to strengthen financial management and the control of banks and money shops, a Financial Administration Bureau has been established to be responsible for inspection and supervision, strictly crack down on financial transactions, restrict bank loans to tighten credit, and revise foreign exchange management measures to improve remittances from overseas Chinese. Last year's import and export trade had a deficit of over 427 billion, with a difference of 50% between imports and exports, but compared with 70% in the 35th year, the deficit has slightly decreased. After reviewing the major financial measures of the past year, Mr. Yu then elaborated on the work plan for the 37th year, which will focus on central and local sources of revenue and the reorganization of tax revenue, in order to increase national treasury revenue. Finally, he emphasized that in order to achieve budget balance, it is necessary to comprehensively control special prices to stabilize the currency value. The price issue is an overall economic issue and cannot be addressed piecemeal. Politics, military affairs, and economics are an integrated whole, and must be uniformly coordinated in order to jointly promote progress.

Improving the Treatment of Civil Servants Awaiting Implementation After Approval by the State Council

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The measures for adjusting the treatment of civil and military personnel will be implemented after being approved at the State Council meeting to be held this Friday. A certain government official told reporters on the evening of the 4th that the adjustment plan has been finalized after several discussions by the government's special review committee. The principle is to start at thirty yuan, calculated based on the cost of living index, and for those above thirty yuan, to calculate at ten percent.

### End of 61 Years of British Rule Birth of the Republic of Burma Solemn Ceremony to Transfer Sovereignty, Officials Including the President Sworn In

[United Press International, Rangoon, 4th] Burma declared independence at 4:20 this morning (9:50 PM standard time), which was determined by astrologers to be an auspicious time, held a flag-raising ceremony, lowered the British flag, and replaced it with the three-colored star-studded flag of the Republic of Burma, thus ending 61 years of British rule in Burma. In addition to officials from the Burmese provincial government and naval and military officers from China, the United States, Britain, and Burma, representatives from India, Pakistan, the Netherlands, Siam, Indonesia, and Australia also attended the grand event.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 4th] British sovereignty in Burma ended two hours before dawn on the 4th, and the sovereignty of the Republic of Burma was born at the same time. The ceremony to transfer sovereignty was held on the lawn in front of the Parliament Building, with about 2,000 people watching. When the British and Burmese flags were raised and lowered alternately amidst the sound of bugles, the whole audience cheered, and the bells, firecrackers, and factory and ship whistles throughout the city also sounded in unison. About ten minutes later, the leaders and diplomats from various countries walked into the Parliament Building, where Burmese President Sao Shwe Thaik officially took office as President and announced the implementation of the new constitution of free Burma. All parliamentary officials stood up and sang the national anthem, and observed two minutes of silence for the martyred leaders such as Aung San. Subsequently, the President officially appointed Thakin Nu as Prime Minister, and Mr. Thakin Nu led the cabinet members in taking the oath of office. After the ceremony, Mr. Thakin Nu addressed the Parliament. When the Burmese leaders and diplomats from various countries walked out of the parliament building, it was dawn. Everyone faced the dawn, silently, but everyone felt that this dawn of January 4, 1948, symbolized freedom and light for Burma.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 4th] After taking office, Burmese President Sao Shwe Thaik issued the following statement to this agency, instructing it to convey it to people all over the world: "Burma, entering a new era of freedom, extends its greetings to the world. We rejoice in the birth of our country, and we feel gratified that the world shares our feelings. On the occasion of entering a period of freedom, we express our gratitude to all free countries, freedom fighters, British politicians, and all those who have helped us to successfully achieve our goals. On the day we join the international ranks, we are determined to maintain the most friendly relations with all countries and do our best to maintain world peace."

[United Press International, Rangoon, 4th] Burma formally became independent today, and the Constituent Assembly is now exercising the power of the Federal Parliament. The new cabinet of 18 people has been appointed, with Thakin Nu remaining as Prime Minister, Bo Let Ya remaining as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Tin Tut remaining as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Ko Nyein remaining as Minister of Internal Affairs. The whole country celebrates for three days, and British, Chinese, and Indian expatriates also join the celebration. After Burma's independence, there are many difficulties ahead, as there is still post-war chaos in various regions.

### Special Telegrams of Congratulations from American and British Leaders Mr. Bowker Appointed as the First British Ambassador to Burma

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd, United Press International] President Truman recently sent a telegram to the President of Burma, congratulating the country on its independence, stating, "On the occasion of the founding of the Republic of Burma, I extend my congratulations on behalf of the American people to Your Excellency, the Prime Minister, and the people of your country. We welcome your country to join the ranks of free and democratic countries, and we guarantee that we sincerely hope that your country will achieve a legitimate position in the international community, and hope that the welfare of all mankind will be further enhanced by your country's participation. We have deep confidence in the people and leaders of your country."

[Reuters, London, 3rd] Prime Minister Attlee's message of congratulations on Burma's independence, on behalf of the British people and government, has been delivered to Burma and will be read out at the celebration ceremony in Rangoon on the 4th. At the celebration ceremony in London on the same day, Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps will deliver a speech on behalf of the British government, and Lord Listowel, who will be relieved of his post as Minister of State for Burmese Affairs from that day, will also participate in the ceremony.

[United Press International, London, 3rd] The British Foreign Office announced tonight that Mr. Bowker has been appointed as the first British Ambassador to Burma. Mr. Bowker is 46 years old and a career diplomat who has been stationed in Egypt, Burma, Norway, Turkey, and Spain, and is currently the British High Commissioner to France.

### Ambassador Luo's Congratulatory Telegram

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd] Luo Jialun, our ambassador to India, sent a telegram to Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu, stating, "In my capacity as the president of the Sino-Burmese Cultural Association, I warmly congratulate your country's independence day on behalf of the association and myself, and hope that the dawn of independence will guide the people of your country into an era of prosperity, and increase cultural, economic, and political cooperation between China and Burma."

### Burmese Parliament Approves the Anglo-Burmese Treaty

[Reuters, Rangoon, 4th] The Federal Parliament of the Republic of Burma approved the Anglo-Burmese Treaty signed by British Prime Minister Attlee and Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu on October 17 in London, at 10:00 AM on the 4th. Communist Party members opposed the treaty and voted against it.

### The Throne is Returned to Burma Sister Countries Hang Flags to Celebrate

[United Press International, New Delhi, 4th] Kyaw Khine, First Secretary of the Burmese Special Envoy, announced today that New Delhi will beat drums and hang flags today to celebrate Burma's independence. Then, the Indian Governor-General Mountbatten will personally return a small table to the Burmese Special Envoy U Win at the Government House as a symbol of the return of the throne to Burma. The table and the actual throne were captured by the British army when they conquered Burma. The throne was moved to the Calcutta Museum after 1886 and will soon be returned to Burma.

### Rumors of Stalin's Illness Swedish Cancer Expert Urgently Summoned to Fly to the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Stockholm, 3rd] Professor Einar Biörklund, a famous Swedish cancer expert, was urgently summoned by the Soviet authorities and flew to Moscow on the 3rd to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of a most serious disease. Before his departure, the professor said that although he was urgently summoned, he still did not know who the patient was. However, according to his colleagues, the unnamed patient is Marshal Stalin. Professor Biörklund flew to Helsinki, Finland on the morning of the 3rd, where a Soviet government special plane was waiting to take Mr. Biörklund directly to Moscow.

According to Professor Biörklund's colleagues, Biörklund is a non-partisan figure and the director of the Radiumhemmet hospital in Stockholm, with extensive experience in cancer treatment. He has many patients in his hospital and is very busy with his diagnosis and treatment duties. If it were not for an important Soviet figure, he would not have abandoned his duties to go to Moscow. Among the important Soviet figures, only Stalin is rumored to be ill. It is expected that after Biörklund arrives in Moscow, the Soviet authorities will request him to keep the patient's identity a secret from everyone else. Another reason to prove that Biörklund's patient is Stalin himself is that the Soviet authorities did not summon Biörklund through the Soviet embassy in Sweden, but directly called Mr. Biörklund. This shows that the patient is an extremely important figure, and the Soviet Union will never want to reveal the state of his health. Even if the patient's condition has deteriorated significantly, they still need to urgently summon a Swedish expert for treatment.

### A Batch of US Marines Head to the Mediterranean for Service Generally Considered Another Indication of US Support for Italy and Greece

[United Press International, Washington, 1st] The Navy Department announced today that a batch of Marines is scheduled to depart from Morehead City, North Carolina on the 6th and head to the Mediterranean to serve on the aircraft carrier "Midway" and three light cruisers. The "Midway" is currently docked in Naples, the cruiser "Portsmouth" is docked in Genoa, the "Providence" is currently docked in Livorno, Italy, and the "Little Rock" is docked in Piraeus, Greece. The US Mediterranean Fleet also has ten destroyers.

[United Press International, Washington, 3rd] Regarding the US sending Marines to the troubled Mediterranean region, diplomatic circles here believe that this is an indication of the US's intention to support the governments of Greece and Italy, which are being oppressed by the Communist Party. The Navy believes that the number of Marines going abroad should be kept a great secret, but another official statement believes that the number is sufficient to give each ship combat capability.

### British Prime Minister Criticizes the Soviet Union Communism Has Already Formed Imperialism Advocates that Europe Should be Led by the Labor Party

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd, United Press International] Prime Minister Attlee today supported the United States' "Cold War" against the Soviet Union. He warned that the communism that is eroding Europe has now formed imperialism. As the Prime Minister of the Labor government, he made the first frank and fierce attack on Soviet communism since the end of the war. He said that what the Communist Party is doing in Eastern Europe today has deprived Western Europe of the traditional spirit of individual freedom and democratic politics.

Mr. Attlee made a clear and general attack on Soviet communism, using the term "communism," during a political broadcast to the nation on the occasion of the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Labor Party. He said: "The history of the Soviet Union provides us with a warning, that is, political freedom and collectivism can quickly disappear and be replaced by new forms of oppression. Soviet communism follows new imperialism, and in terms of theory, economy, and strategy, it is enough to threaten the prosperity and way of life of other European countries."

[Reuters, London, 4th] British Labor Party members believe that Prime Minister Attlee's political speech to the British people, although nominally a political broadcast within the party, its international significance far outweighs its internal significance. Attlee's open advocacy that European countries should be led by the Labor Party, entering a democratic socialism between communism and capitalism, is still unprecedented. Attlee's determination to make this kind of ideological propaganda on the day that Britain has achieved considerable economic success is intended to give his remarks more strength. French Socialist Party leader Blum also made similar remarks last November, but the result was unable to gain the support of the French Parliament. Attlee's background is significantly different from Blum's. Attlee has the support of a parliamentary majority in the country, and Britain occupies a leading position in Western European economic cooperation, which can give his remarks more strength.

### Italian Constitution Takes Effect US-Italian Agreement Signed

[Reuters, London, 1st] On New Year's Day, Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi broadcast to the nation on Rome Radio, calling for national unity and explaining the significance of the Republican Constitution taking effect from that day. He said, "The new constitution has been completed. We should now all have a spirit of brotherhood, so that the principle of unity declared in the constitution does not become a mere formality. The people can be sure that the democratic republic is a regime that moves towards every social reform." According to Rome Radio, the Quirinal Palace, where the former King of Italy lived, will be the palace of the President of the Republic.

[United Press International, Rome, 3rd] The US-Italian Interim Aid Agreement was signed at the Italian Foreign Ministry on the 3rd. It is expected that Italy will receive 160 million US dollars from the five billion dollars approved by the American people.

### New Soviet Ambassador to the US Presents Credentials Truman Emphasizes Mutual Trust

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The new Soviet Ambassador to the US, Panyushkin, said yesterday when he presented his credentials to President Truman that he believes his most important task is to strengthen political, economic, and cultural relations between the US and the Soviet Union in order to promote universal peace. In his reply, Truman assured Mr. Panyushkin that the United States shares the same sentiment, saying that the American people want to live peacefully in a stable and prosperous world. Mr. Truman stressed that in order to successfully solve the complex post-war problems of today's world, both sides need a spirit of mutual understanding and trust.

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] It is reported that President Truman, concerned that the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe may encounter delays in Congress, will emphasize the need for Congress to take swift action on the plan in his state of the union address to both houses of Congress on the 3rd.

Truman had originally set April 1 as the deadline for final approval of the Marshall Plan, but White House officials revealed that Truman was concerned that countries such as Britain, France, and Italy were likely to fall into the most serious economic difficulties before that date. Therefore, he again moved up this deadline. The President believes that if the European recovery plan is not finally completed before June 1, it will cause tragic consequences, and it will ultimately be necessary to propose another emergency aid plan for Europe. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin hearing opinions on the European Recovery Plan in the middle of this week, at which time Secretary of State Marshall will also emphasize the urgency of Europe's need for aid.

[United Press International, Washington, 3rd] Secretary of State Marshall will reply to some criticisms of the European aid plan on the 5th after completing his short trip out of town. Marshall himself will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee two days later.

### New Cabinet Crisis in France Schumann Uses His Resignation to Fight for the New Economic Plan Asks Congress for a Vote of Confidence for the Second Time

[United Press International, Paris, 100th] French Prime Minister Schumann today presented a compromise bill to Congress to prevent inflation and used his resignation to fight for the full passage of the bill.

[Reuters, Paris, 100th] Some people even predict that if the Schumann government cannot quickly restore the stability of the national economy and food supply, General de Gaulle may have hope of seizing power in April.

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] The French government's new plan to save the franc has encountered various criticisms in Congress. Prime Minister Schumann has asked the National Assembly for a vote of confidence for the second time. The Communist Party and right-wing members have again proposed six amendments to Article 3 of the bill regarding the obligation of farmers to pay special income tax. Prime Minister Schumann then requested a vote of confidence for the second time. According to the French constitution, a vote of confidence must be voted on a full day after the government requests it. Prime Minister Schumann therefore suggested that if the government requests a vote of confidence on several points, it should be voted on the same day to save time. According to the first plan proposed by the government, the total amount of special income tax to be levied was approximately 155 billion francs. The new plan has reduced it by one-third to 125 billion francs. Observers pointed out that Prime Minister Schumann's expression of determination to stake the survival of the government on the bill shows that the Schumann government, which has been established for just five weeks, is facing another crisis, at a time when the so-called "Third Force" center-left political parties are trying to consolidate their position to resist the left and right attacks of the Communist Party and de Gaulle faction. However, the government's intention to reduce the amount of special income tax by one-third has shown the weakness of the "Third Force". This new Schumann cabinet may once again be in danger.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 3rd] The Security Council is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 6th to review India's call for immediate action by the Security Council on the Kashmir issue.

He hoped that Nehru and his government would not take such action, but Pakistan is ready to cope with any eventuality.

### Tojo Hideki Equivocates Does Not Admit that Japan Adopted Totalitarian Politics

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Former "Iron-Fisted" Prime Minister Tojo Hideki told the military tribunal this afternoon that he never attempted to establish a totalitarian government in Japan, and that he was not even aware of the meaning of totalitarianism.

He replied in a sharp tone that Japan has its own characteristics in political ideology and methods, and never intended to imitate Nazi Germany. He admitted that the war in China, in which Japan was bogged down, was the biggest burden Japan suffered, and that Japan had to make major changes in its national policy in 1948.

### Police Bureau Recommends Measures to Suppress Rice Prices Surprise Raids on Granaries and Expansion of Emergency Rice Distribution

The Economic Division of the Municipal Police Bureau has drafted several specific measures to effectively suppress rice prices and has recommended them to the authorities for implementation. The main points of the measures are: Implement a proportional price limit system. The price limits in the past were too rigid and difficult to be effective. The proportional price limit system will allow for flexible adjustments depending on the actual situation, so that economic police have a basis for enforcement. Several locations in the suburbs have now formed small-scale markets. If there are no plans to establish suburban rice markets, they should be strictly banned. However, the return of rice to the city should be facilitated. According to investigations, there is still plenty of rice in the city. Drastic fluctuations in rice prices and hoarding are also important reasons. It is planned that economic police will conduct surprise inspections of various granaries and reward informants. Expand the emergency distribution of rice to civilians.

### Customs Employees End "Hunger Strike"; General Assembly Reports on Petition Results and Urges Patience Pending Resolution

[Our Reporter] The issue of customs employees demanding the issuance of year-end bonuses equivalent to two months' salary and a winter clothing allowance of 4 million yuan per person has not yet been resolved. On the 2nd of this month, the Chief Inspector of Customs, Li Du, led five employee representatives, including Fan Hao, to Nanjing to petition Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance.

### Difficulties Encountered in Planning Sino-Japanese Air Route; Allied Headquarters Insists on Self-Financing of All Ground Equipment and Facilities

[Our Reporter] The preparations of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) for opening a Sino-Japanese air route have reportedly encountered difficulties, and whether they will succeed is still uncertain. This is because General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo insists that CNAC must self-finance all ground equipment and daily necessities in Tokyo. Furthermore, although CNAC aircraft can land in Tokyo, Tokyo cannot be the final destination. In this case, CNAC's plan to transport passengers and cargo between Shanghai and Tokyo cannot be realized. Moreover, the cost of self-financing ground equipment and daily necessities without the assistance of General MacArthur's headquarters would be difficult to bear.

### Garrison Command Smashes Air-Transported Drug Trafficking Operation; Shanghai-Beiping Network Captured in One Fell Swoop

### Coldly Observing People of All Walks of Life in the Registration Room of the District Prosecutor's Office; Regardless of Your Identity, Everyone Is Equal Here: Inexhaustible Strange Shapes and Each Has Their Own Expressions

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Sitting in the registration room of the District Prosecutor's Office for half an hour and seeing a microcosm of people from all walks of life in Shanghai is a very interesting thing.

All criminal cases, except for a small number of special criminal cases and self-prosecutions, must go through the investigation stage to determine whether to prosecute or not. In a large and densely populated city like Shanghai, the frequency of conflicts and disputes between people every day means that once a legal issue is involved, the first hurdle is the District Prosecutor's Office, and the first hurdle during the investigation is the registration room. Therefore, the registration room is constantly busy and its threshold is worn through.

When a complainant or defendant receives a summons from the prosecutor, the summons specifies the date and time. They arrive at the District Prosecutor's Office on time and show the summons to the duty bailiff in the registration room. The bailiff registers the summons and fills out a roll call list. When the prosecutor handling the case opens the court, the bailiff holding the roll call sheet calls out the summoned person, who is led by the bailiff into the designated investigation court to be questioned by the prosecutor. The investigation period is absolutely secret, and no one is allowed to eavesdrop. After the prosecutor has finished questioning, he indicates on the roll call sheet whether the person is to be detained, released on bail, or dismissed, depending on the severity of the case.

Two Exceptions. Different Expressions.

Don't look down on these two unremarkable bungalows. Many dignitaries, prominent officials, wealthy merchants, magnates, monks, Taoists, women, and even mistresses have to sit on cold benches here. People from all walks of life, such as Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan; Deng Zhonghe, General Manager of Anle Textile Factory; Xu Letian, former Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee; Lin Fengbao, former Director of the National Bank's Business Bureau; Yang Anren, Deputy Director; Jin Laohu Zhan Yunsheng; Yang Laohu Mesi Bo; Zhu Huang Fangbai, who falsely claimed to be a female judge; Yong Ci, Xin Ci, Zhen, Xingkong, monks from Longhua Temple; Fa Wu, Fa Jing, Rong Zhou, Lin Qing, nuns from Jingxiu Nunnery; all kinds of people are here. No matter how luxurious and stylish they are usually, at this time, they all restrain themselves and sit quietly in a corner waiting to be summoned. In the past year, there have only been two exceptions who were questioned directly by the prosecutor without going through the registration room: one was former National Bank President Bei Zuyi, and the other was former Director of the Direct Taxation Bureau, Lou Guowei.

Coldly Watching the Different Expressions of People Waiting in the Registration Room

Each person has a different expression, which is the best place to observe and analyze each person's psychology. All are restless, pacing back and forth; some are silent and close their eyes to rest; some are muttering words, as if rehearsing the answers to questions in court; some have been waiting too long and fall asleep; some who have been beaten are groaning; some drug addicts are lying on the ground and yelling. All kinds of strange shapes are endless.

### Prosecutors Hate Scalpers

Because the investigation period is secret, defendants are generally most afraid of being detained. Some cunning people take advantage of this weakness and create a group of court scalpers. These people use the nearby teahouses as their base camp and claim to be familiar with the prosecutors and can find a way to get people released on bail. The parties inevitably have to spend a little money. If the case is not serious, the prosecutor may know that bail will be granted or the person will be dismissed. The parties do not know the details and sincerely appreciate the scalpers' help. Unfortunately, if they are detained, the scalpers claim that the number of people they lobbied was not enough. In reality, the prosecutors are wrongly accused. Therefore, the District Prosecutor's Office often hates these scalpers. The last time the owners of several teahouses were summoned was for this matter. Since that summons, the scalpers have been afraid of legal sanctions and have slightly restrained themselves, daring not to be too blatant.

### Steamship Companies Considering Price Increase; Meeting to Discuss Tomorrow; Expected to Increase by 70 Percent

[Our Reporter] Steamship companies in the city are considering raising prices again due to recent price increases. It is also learned that the price of allocated coal will increase by 50 percent. The cost of wharves is nearly 3 million yuan per ton. Although freight and passenger fares increased by 45 percent starting on November 21st of last year, this is no longer sufficient to cover costs. The Rates Committee of the Steamship Commercial Association convened an emergency meeting on the 2nd to discuss how to make up for the high costs. As a result, the committee recommended to the board of directors and supervisors that freight and ticket prices be adjusted to make up for the costs. It is learned that the board of directors and supervisors of the Steamship Association will hold a regular meeting tomorrow to discuss the Rates Committee's recommendation to adjust freight and ticket prices. The expected adjustment is approximately 70 percent.

### Qingyuan Art Society's Exhibition Items Selected Clean; Today Is the Last Day

They arrested bandit Chen Changlin. At 4:30 PM on the same afternoon, they arrested his accomplice Xu Pinzhang at No. 7 in the same lane. In his residence, they seized one Mauser pistol, five bullets, one C96 pistol, four bullets, one women's dark blue chevron overcoat, and one pearl ring. Based on Xu's confession, officers were sent to No. 11, Lane 860, Tian'anli Road at around 5:00 or 6:00 PM and continued to apprehend accomplice Zhu Baosheng. At 9:00 PM, Wang Muxiang was apprehended at Chen Changlin's home at No. 1384, Fanhuanji Road. Police then proceeded to Wang's house at No. 1, Garden Lane, Liyuan Road, Nanshi, and seized two Mauser pistols and five bullets. They also found stolen goods such as jade earrings, small rings, silver ingots, silver rings, velvet shirts, and 2.09 million yuan in cash. On the afternoon of the 29th, at 8:00 PM, it was learned that the bandit leader Chen Zhirong lived at No. 17, Lane 476, Changning Road. Officers were dispatched, but Chen was out. Only his mother-in-law, Xia Zhang Xiucui, and his wife, Chen Xia Xiuli, were apprehended. An eight-inch revolver and forty-two bullets were found in the shed. A herringbone wool Western-style overcoat was also discovered. According to Chen Changlin's confession, Zhu Baosheng still had a pistol and ten bullets with him. Subsequently, after Zhu was arrested, a loaded firearm was indeed seized.

The bandits confessed that:

*   On July 7th last fall, at 11:00 AM, they robbed Chen Mingzhi's home at No. 122 Julu Road, stealing cash and jewelry estimated to be worth more than 90 million yuan.
*   On October 8th, they robbed the Qianjian family at No. 12, Lane 269, Huai'an Road, stealing clothing and jewelry worth 18.5 million yuan.
*   On November 3rd, they robbed a group of people of 5 million yuan in cash at No. 1394, Zhongzheng East Road intersection.
*   On November 13th, they robbed the Xinyi Needle and Thread Shop Longfa Branch, opened by Ding Zhu at No. 12, Lane 57, Zijin Road, of 38 million yuan in fiat currency.
*   On December 16th, at 12:00 PM, they robbed four households at No. 45 Jinjia Lane, Xinzha Road, including the Lu family, stealing jade rings and other items. They robbed Yang Chen Biqiu of 500,000 yuan in cash. Also, they robbed the Chen Jia Geng, an apprentice at the Jinlan Company on Linsen Middle Road, of a dark blue chevron women's overcoat that was just delivered to Fan Mingren's house.

The police branch plans to transfer the case to the court for prosecution after the investigation is completed.

### The Executive Yuan's Air Transport Team Approved to Continue for Another Year; Future Name Undecided

[Our Report] The Executive Yuan's Air Transport Team, led by Flying Tiger General Chennault, was scheduled to conclude its operations at the end of last year along with the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA).

### New Year's New Policy in Hong Kong: Civil Servants' Salary Increase Announced on New Year's Day

(Our Report from Hong Kong, 1st) This is the third New Year since the British re-entered Hong Kong. If the first New Year was the "Year of Military Administration" and the second was the "Year of Merchants," then this New Year is the "Year of Civil Servants." The long-awaited salary increase for Hong Kong government civil servants was finally officially announced on New Year's Day. Those with a monthly salary of HK$1,000 will receive a 30% increase, those with HK$1,500 will receive a 20% increase, and laborers with the lowest salaries will receive a 200% increase (but they will benefit the least compared to those with high salaries). In addition, those with a monthly salary of HK$150 or more will also receive a "cost of living allowance" of at least HK$100 and at most HK$480. Therefore, a mid-level civil servant who previously earned around HK$200 per month will see their income increase to over HK$400 after the raise. Not only that, but the salary increase will be calculated from January 1, 1947. In other words, in addition to an increase of more than half in their income from New Year's Day, civil servants can also receive back pay for the past 12 months, ranging from HK$400 or HK$500 to HK$2,000 or HK$3,000. The Hong Kong government has stated that it will be issued in full before the Lunar New Year, so they can truly enjoy a "prosperous year"! While the general public is congratulating civil servants, some civil servants are expressing mixed joy and fear, suggesting that the Hong Kong government may offset part of the back pay with the repayment of the Recovery and Reconstruction Bonds. Merchants in general have paid close attention to this matter because, with an average of HK$500 in back pay for each of the 20,000 Hong Kong government civil servants, the market before the Lunar New Year will see an immediate increase of HK$1 million in purchasing power, which is truly a tonic for the currently sluggish market. The general salaried class, who are not civil servants, both envy and worry about this good news for civil servants, because they not only have no opportunity for a salary increase but also face the threat of rising prices due to the HK$1 million stimulus. As for economists, they suspect the Hong Kong dollar's inflation and are further elaborating on "profound theories," which need not be discussed here. These past two days, the weather in Hong Kong has been particularly sunny, harmonious, and warm, with a feeling of gentle breezes and a bright sun. This is a rare respite given by nature to those "living in peace and quiet," and it is indeed precious. (Special Correspondent Zi Jian)

### Jiangsu Province Orders Completion of County Telephone Networks by the End of the Month

(Our Report from Zhenjiang, 3rd) While bandit suppression is underway in both southern and northern Jiangsu, the provincial government, in order to coordinate with military operations, has ordered all counties to complete their rural and town telephone networks to strengthen communications. The "Measures for Establishing Rural and Town Telephone Networks" were passed at the 147th Provincial Government Meeting. The main points are summarized as follows: Each county and city will use its seat of government as the hub of the telephone network and establish a telephone exchange. Counties and cities with telecommunications bureaus should connect with nearby counties and cities and connect to long-distance lines. The main telephone lines will be guarded by self-defense team members dispatched by the district and township offices under the jurisdiction of the county and city governments, who will be responsible for patrolling day and night to prevent bandits from sabotage and thieves from stealing. Each county and city should purchase and store materials for emergency repairs. The telephone networks of each county and city must be completed by the end of January. Counties and cities that have not been fully recovered should set up the networks as soon as they are recovered and complete them within one month. The expenses required for setting up the telephone network and purchasing equipment will be covered by the original expenses and the second reserve fund of the counties and cities. If these are insufficient, additional funds should be raised in consultation with the county and city councils to ensure rapid completion within the deadline. No delays or failures will be permitted under the pretext of financial difficulties, and the progress of the work must be reported to the province for inspection.

### Liang Officer Liu Xinru Colludes with Rice Merchants for Profit; Four People Indicted for Corruption

(Our Report from Suzhou, 4th) Liu Xinru, a warehouse administrator at the Jiangyin County Food and Grain Office, has been using his position to convert over 2,800 shi of stored grain tax rice into cash since the winter before last.

### Pioneering Spirit: Two or Three Things About the Hunan-Guangxi Railway

(Our Report from Hengyang, 3rd) Looking at a railway map of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway area, there are four lines in this area, just like an X shape, or like a slender-waisted woman lying there, raising both arms and spreading her legs. Her left arm extends to Hengyang, Hunan, shaking hands with her sister—the Guangdong-Hankou Railway; her right arm stretches to Guiyang on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau; one leg crosses the Ten Thousand Mountains and extends to Zhennanguan; the other leg stretches into Guangzhou Bay. Now, her left arm has been activated, and her right arm is gradually recovering. Only her two legs are still in a state of paralysis. When will she be able to stand up? Judging from the current situation, it is unknown when that will be!

### Relentless Shelling: Destroyed Her Arms

The heart of this slender-waisted woman is located in Liuzhou. The left arm from Liuzhou to Hengyang is the Hunan-Guangxi Line of the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway, which is 560 kilometers long and passes through Luorong, Yongfu, Guilin, Xing'an, Quanxian, Lengshuitan, and reaches Hengyang City. It is the major artery of the southwest, built during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and has made great contributions to military and economic transportation. Unfortunately, in the autumn of 1944, the military situation in Hunan and Guangxi deteriorated, and the enemy invaded westward. This wartime major artery of the southwest fell into enemy hands. Subsequently, the enemy, with overwhelming force, advanced directly to eastern Guizhou, and her right arm—the Guizhou-Guangxi Line—was also destroyed. At that time, our policy against the enemy was "scorched earth resistance" and "clearing the fields and strengthening the walls," so the railway naturally needed to be destroyed under this policy. On the eve of the railway bureau's evacuation, all important projects and equipment such as bridges, tunnels, culverts, locomotives, and vehicles were ruthlessly destroyed, especially the bridges and culverts, which were destroyed most thoroughly. There were more than 100 large and small bridges on the Hunan-Guangxi Line, and about 50 culverts, all of which were completely destroyed in a short period of time.

### Giving Priority to Others: Delayed Traffic for Two Years

After the war ended, the rehabilitation of the railways was the most important part of the national rehabilitation effort. However, limited by financial resources, the government could not rehabilitate all the railways at the same time and could only weigh the importance of each at the time, giving priority to repairing the roads that needed to be repaired more urgently. The Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Hankou, and Guangdong-Hankou Railways were the ones that needed to be given priority at that time. It was not that the Hunan-Guangxi Railway area was not important, but compared to the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou Railways, it was less important at the beginning of the national rehabilitation. Therefore, the Hunan-Guangxi section was only opened to traffic two years after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Those who do not understand the inside story may not think that this opening to traffic after a delay of two years is anything to praise. In fact, the opening to traffic of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway this time is certainly worthy of special mention in the history of transportation in the southwest, and the spirit of hard work and struggle has not been seen in the rehabilitation of any other railway in the country today. Last month, foreign personnel from UNRRA visited the rehabilitation project and marveled at the spirit of struggle of the Hunan-Guangxi Line this time, calling it a miracle in the history of engineering. It is certainly not an exaggeration.

### Dismantling and Supplementing: A Clever Woman Cannot Cook Without Rice

The Hunan-Guangxi Line first opened the Liuzhou-Guilin section in January of this year, and then began the track restoration work from Guilin to Hengyang. The Ministry of Communications ordered the completion of the entire line by the end of December of this year, but there was an extreme shortage of materials, especially the steel rails and accessories for the 230-kilometer section from Quanxian to Hengyang, which had been dismantled and moved to repair the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. It was really impossible for a clever woman to cook without rice because it was impossible to supplement such a long section of steel rails and sleepers. Seeing this situation, the Ministry of Communications promised to allocate 260 kilometers of steel rails and 350,000 sleepers, but for various reasons, nothing was ever delivered. In this situation, the railway comrades had no choice but to weigh the priorities, move the slow to help the urgent, and adapt to the environment. They dismantled and supplemented the section of track from Nandan to Jinchengjiang and all other branch lines, which added a lot of difficulty to the work. (Special Correspondent Huang Chaoru)

### After the Hong Kong Governor's Visit to Nanjing, a Financial Agreement Will Be Implemented Today; Goods Shipped to Hong Kong for Transit Must Submit a Certificate; The Limit for Carrying National Currency Is 5 Million Yuan

[Our Report] All parties are greatly concerned about the Sino-Hong Kong agreement. According to the spokesman of the Central Bank, the agreement was signed on August 15 last year. Since then, changes have taken place in the environment on both sides, so the Hong Kong side still needs to make considerable adjustments. After the Hong Kong Governor visited Nanjing to discuss the matter, it was decided to implement the following provisions of the agreement first. Preparations have now been completed and implementation is beginning.

Starting from January 5, major export goods from our country, such as antimony, tin, tung oil, rapeseed oil, pig bristles, and cotton yarn, must submit a "CBC8a Revised" certificate when shipped to Hong Kong for transit, proving that the foreign exchange earned from shipping these goods from China to Hong Kong has been sold to or stipulated to be credited to a designated Chinese bank. Otherwise, the Hong Kong government will not allow transit exports.

The spokesman of the National Bank said that this measure will be of great value in the management of China's export foreign exchange. It is expected that the foreign exchange income of our government can be increased. As a result, the import foreign exchange quota in the South China region has recently been appropriately relaxed.

From the same day, the Hong Kong government will prohibit carrying more than 5 million yuan in cash in and out of the country. This measure is the same as China's current method of restricting the shipment of cash. The Hong Kong government is now formulating rules to manage general banks. This is a stricter method for the Hong Kong government to manage the so-called money industry organizations that have been established in Hong Kong in recent years. At the same time, it will enable our country to more effectively curb the current situation of evading existing management methods and illegally profiting.

One item in the financial agreement is that the manifest of any ship sailing from Hong Kong to China must be stamped by the Hong Kong government. This method has already been implemented.

All the terms of this financial agreement are concrete measures that are interconnected. In the spirit of cooperation and goodwill, the two governments have conducted careful and precise consultations to ensure that the interests of both parties are taken into account before this achievement can be achieved. This agreement is an important milestone in the relationship between our country and Hong Kong.

As for the implementation of other steps in the agreement, they are also actively under negotiation.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 4th Special Telegram] The Hong Kong government announced that in the future, certain designated Chinese products, such as tungsten, antimony, wool, oils, rapeseed oil, tin tea, pig bristles, cotton yarn, etc., must be accompanied by a certificate of origin issued by the Chinese authorities when exported from Hong Kong. It also said that the government's measure is to help China protect its foreign exchange income from major export goods, but such certificates are not required for export goods that are not Chinese native products. Currently, account holders storing Chinese-produced goods here must register the stored goods with the Hong Kong Import and Export Trade Department before the 8th of this month. The registered goods will not be subject to this new measure.

### Price Increases Reported in Production Areas, Arrivals Scarce; Shanghai White Japonica Rice Fluctuates Violently; Municipal Government Cables Jiangsu Provincial Government to Quickly Stabilize Prices in Production Areas

During the New Year holidays, the price of rice in the city rose sharply. Although the North and South markets were not officially open, there were many buyers, and those holding goods refused to sell, forming a situation where there was a price but no market. On the 3rd, the market price, after the authorities' best efforts to persuade, the opening price of white japonica rice was 1.2 million yuan per unit, while the retail price was very chaotic.

According to the investigation of the Economic Section of the Police Bureau, the reasons for the rise in rice prices are: Price increases reported in production areas, Arrivals scarce, The market is abnormal, There are off-market transactions in the suburbs, The year-end bonuses of employees in various industries in the city have been successively distributed. This huge amount of hot money is competing to buy food rice as the target, and after the stocks of retailers are snapped up by citizens, they are eager to replenish them, driving up the price again and again.

In addition to having telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to quickly stabilize rice prices in the production areas and facilitate transportation, the municipal authorities have also ordered economic police to be dispatched in full force on the 5th to supervise the rice markets and other markets in order to stabilize general prices.

No Plans to Sell Food Rice Yet

Also, the North and South Rice Markets rose in a straight line after the 2nd. The price of white japonica rice from Wuxi production area was quoted at 1.25 million yuan per dan (picul) the day before yesterday (the 3rd). The North Market immediately rose, and the closing price was above 1.3 million yuan, and the retail price exceeded 1.4 million yuan. Therefore, Mayor Wu telegraphed the Executive Yuan President Zhang, requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be ordered to quickly stop the soaring price of rice in Wuxi, and telegraphed the Grain Department and the China Farmers Bank to stop purchasing in the production areas. Regarding whether the Social Affairs Bureau will restore the selling policy when necessary, Director Wu said yesterday that the authorities have not considered this yet, and that selling would only create opportunities for merchants and people to hoard if it could not be dealt with skillfully, and consumers would not have any rights to gain.

### This Year's Increase in Domestic Paper Production Will Focus on Newspapers

The paper that is currently most lacking domestically are three types: newspaper, cigarette paper, and banknote paper. Cigarette paper requires 100,000 tons per month, and the Shanghai Minfeng Factory has already produced 60,000 tons, and it is expected to be self-sufficient this year. Newspapers are very scarce and urgently need to increase production. At the paper production increase meeting convened by the National Economic Council in Nanjing last year, it was decided that this year's increase in newspaper production will be the main focus, accounting for half of the estimated planned figures. The proportion of imported pulp for paper production has been relaxed to 42%, because ordinary one ton of pulp can be mixed with two tons of waste cotton etc., which can produce three tons of newspaper, saving two-thirds of the foreign exchange for paper. The various paper companies under the Resources Committee are tasked with producing 10,000 tons of paper this year. However, judging from the current situation of various factories, it is particularly difficult. Only the Shenyang factory in the five Northeast paper factories is still able to produce. Production at the two Andong factories, the Dangkou factory, and the Jinzhou factory has been suspended due to damage. Although the factories in Taiwan are more developed, there is still a shortage of raw materials. If Taiwan Sugar can increase production to 600,000 tons this year, sugarcane stalks can be used as raw materials for papermaking, which can supply other factories. As for the manufacturing plants in the suburbs of Tianjin, if there is no shortage of raw materials and electricity in the future, the No. 3 machine will be dedicated to producing newspapers, then the paper needs of the two cities of Peiping and Tianjin can be satisfied. The monthly output must be maintained at at least 200 tons this year. In terms of raw materials, sulfur procurement is the most difficult. Bitter soil (i.e., magnesium oxide), which is necessary for reed pulp papermaking, has been unable to supply since the fall of Dashiqiao. If the Tianjin Paper Factory wants to increase production to the planned quantity, it now needs to purchase a large amount of reeds. At least 15,000 tons must be purchased, and the current market price is 2 million yuan per ton, totaling 30 billion yuan. The paper factory itself feels unable to raise this huge amount of money.

### Sugar Prices Rising Sharply

During the New Year holidays, the Taiwan Corporation's first phase of distribution continued as usual on the 2nd. The prices of Taiwan Red and Cotton White Sugar did not change, but informal transactions were very active among peers due to the winter sales promotion, so prices rose in unison. The degree of the rise was like white sugar rising by about 15-16% and red sugar rising by about 15-16%, while green sugar rose by about 19-16% due to the lack of arrivals. It is predicted that the market may be slightly stable today, but it depends on whether the actual sales are positive or not.

High Price for Green Bamboo Shoots

Green bamboo shoots are in season for winter sales, and the opening price has been raised again and again. During the New Year holidays, high-quality embroidery tip embroidery lakes, combined with sub-brands, opened to 8 million yuan, and the momentum was very good.

### China Agricultural and Industrial Bank Moves to New Address for Business

### During the New Year Holidays, the Stock Market Called for High Prices

Although the days before yesterday were New Year's holidays, there were some scattered off-market transactions. Yongsha, which will be delivered today, was once called as high as 600 yuan, and there was a supply at the final price of 585 yuan. The Hong Kong Shen Electric price at the end of the year has been reported to have shrunk to within 3 yuan.

### Hong Kong Gold Prices Rise

[United Press, Hong Kong, 3rd] The market price of gold jumped 10 yuan today, opening at 304 Hong Kong dollars per tael and closing at 314 yuan, still with high buying interest.

Also, the Central Trust Bureau has resumed operations in Hong Kong.

All of the aforementioned overdue tax payment certificates should be submitted to the General Affairs Section of this exchange for cancellation.

### Application Procedures for Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Materials Arriving at Port

[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the issue of purchasing self-provided foreign exchange materials arriving at port, importers and the Central Trust Bureau have reached a consensus in principle on various detailed measures. Furthermore, the markup percentages for paper and steel have been agreed upon and announced. Research and discussion on other materials such as hardware, copper, tin, wood, raw materials, and pigments have also commenced, and it is expected that solutions will be reached successively in the near future. Regarding the detailed procedures for applying for purchase and applying for acquisition, importers generally lack clarity. Therefore, our reporter specifically visited Hua Hongxiao, the general representative who represented sixteen industry trade associations in negotiations with the bureau, to inquire about the detailed procedures for applying for the purchase and acquisition of self-provided foreign exchange materials arriving at port. According to him:

After the markup percentage for the materials of the industry concerned is announced, if the importing merchant is willing to sell the materials arriving at port to the government, they should immediately send a letter with the returned registration copy issued by the Secretariat of the Import Management Committee, stating their willingness to sell, or adding words such as hoping that the applicant will still have priority in acquiring the materials after the purchase. Along with this, they should submit the original bill of lading (without endorsement), the original invoice, and six copies of the completed application permit to the designated bank for transfer to the responsible department of the Import Management Committee (goods in Schedules 1 and 3 are under the jurisdiction of the Non-Quota Department, while goods in Schedule 2 are under the jurisdiction of the Allocation Department).

After receiving the above application, the responsible department of the Import Management Committee will review it and send it to the Visa Department for visa processing. After the visa is issued, the permit and bill of lading will be directly sent to the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau.

After receiving the documents transferred by the Import Management Committee, the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau will fill out and issue a purchase notification letter, which will be sent directly to the original applicant importing merchant. At the same time, a blank "Application for Purchase by the Central Trust Bureau" form will be attached for use.

Upon receiving the purchase notification from the Central Trust Bureau, the importing merchant should complete the purchase application form and all required documents within two weeks and submit them to the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau. At the same time, they should request a priority purchase application form from the Central Trust Bureau, as well as documents such as the "List of Contracts Sold to Direct Users" for completion. After receiving the purchase application form and attachments, the Central Trust Bureau will issue a "Purchase Certificate" to the original importing merchant for safekeeping. This purchase certificate serves as a receipt for the purchased goods and will be used to exchange for special foreign currency deposit certificates in the future.

Within three weeks after the Central Trust Bureau issues the purchase certificate, the importing merchant must complete the "Priority Purchase Application Form" and submit it along with two copies of the direct user order and ten copies of the direct user contract list. The contract list should bear the certification stamp of the trade association and be submitted to the Central Trust Bureau for priority purchase.

After receiving the purchase application, the Central Trust Bureau will review it to ensure it complies with the regulations and then notify the original importing merchant to complete the purchase procedures. After receiving this notice, the original importing merchant will go to the Central Trust Bureau to sign the contract and find two reputable shop guarantors to sign the guarantee on the contract. For the payment of the goods, 25% will be paid in cash, 25% will be paid with a 30-day commercial acceptance bill, and 50% will be paid with a 45-day commercial acceptance bill. Once the above procedures are completed, the original bill of lading will be borrowed from the Central Trust Bureau, along with the signed import permit, and the original importing merchant will handle customs clearance (the original importing merchant will take delivery of the goods first, and the other one-half will be returned to the Central Trust Bureau as collateral, and at the same time, the previous "Bill of Lading Guarantee Letter" will be withdrawn.)

After the 45-day period expires and the Central Trust Bureau receives the final acceptance bill without error, the original importing merchant who purchased the goods can retrieve the remaining one-half of the bill of lading from the Central Trust Bureau, as well as the special foreign currency deposit certificates that were deposited but not claimed. At this point, the entire procedure for applying for purchase and allocation of purchase is completed.

### Management of Scientific Research in the United States

— Zheng Zuoqing

Fifty-two public scientific research institutes in the United States, with 30,000 scientists engaged, have spent $200 million on equipment, researching various issues, including preventing pests and diseases in tomatoes, as well as atomic energy and cancer. Last year, the cost of public scientific research exceeded $600 million, of which $400 million was for research at universities, factories, mines, and financial institutions. As for the cost of private research, it is estimated to be worth $60 million. The above is a report from the National Science Foundation in Washington.

Last October, John R. Steelman, Director of the Scientific Research Board of the United States, published a reorganization plan for the entire U.S. government's scientific research agencies in his treatise, "Management of Scientific Research." This treatise first stated the need for reorganizing scientific research agencies.

"Today, the nation is spending unprecedented financial resources on scientific research and development, but we must have an accurate policy. Our goal is to promote human health, increase our happiness, and improve living standards, while also considering the needs of national defense security. Therefore, we require the government to take steps to achieve the most effective utilization."

Steelman proposed the following steps:

Establish a joint committee of various scientific research departments to unify planning, comprehensively plan the work of each department, and achieve the greatest possible gains.

Establish a expenditure agency to review the relationship of state research plans to the government's overall scientific plan.

In the President's council, there must be one person specifically responsible for transmitting news of scientific secrets and inventions among scientists to Congress and departments related to scientific administration.

Congress should authorize the establishment of a National Science Foundation, with half of its members being directors of government scientific research administrative departments and half being reputable scientists and educators from the private sector. The foundation has the power to handle the allocation of funds to universities and state research institutions.

In this 324-page treatise, Director Steelman discussed various trivial issues in detail, without any omissions. For example, the government must pay scientific researchers an annual salary of $15,000, etc.

Finally, the treatise emphasized that the general plan's provisions do not imply centralized management and new legal controls. "To fully achieve the goal of maximizing the happiness of all people, the government must shoulder this huge responsibility to ensure that a large amount of financial resources are not wasted. Only under the same goal determined by the government can we work together to achieve success."

### Element Plutonium 94 of the Atomic Age

— Gang Ren

Since John Dalton created the atomic theory, chemists have arranged the periodic table of their painstaking efforts. From Madam Curie's discovery of radium and the research of various radioactive substances to Dr. O.E. Lawrence's smashing of atoms, there have been a series of amazing changes and achievements in the scientific world.

The great scientific progress has enabled mankind to not only understand and use all materials but also to start creating everything it needs. The transmutation of radioactive materials and the research of splitting atoms have led mankind to discover new elements for human use. Plutonium is the latest product.

To this day, this new element has not only been successfully manufactured, but it is hoped that it can be mass-produced soon.

The completion of this work will be the completion of a revolution in the scientific and power worlds. It leads mankind to truly embark on the road of the atomic age and completely changes everything today. Therefore, this human-created element is not only the most powerful vanguard but will also be a pillar in the atomic age.

Hundreds of years of careful research and thousands of experiments have analyzed and summarized the raw materials that create all substances on Earth into many material cornerstones that were considered indivisible at the time—atoms—and arranged them into a fairly perfect table, a periodic table of ninety-two elements.

This is indeed a very valuable table because as long as we know the ordinal number of an atom, we can know its properties fairly accurately in this table. However, there are also two unsatisfactory aspects, namely, the many blanks in the table and why the number of atoms stops at ninety-two.

Scientists examined the elements at the end of the table and found them to be radioactive, so they speculated that the undiscovered elements also had radioactivity and instability. But at that time, the work of groping in the dark was extremely difficult. This work only revealed a glimmer of light after Lawrence smashed the atom in 1939.

The amazing exploration began in the hands of an Italian scientist, Eurco Ferme. Unfortunately, this research was led astray because the result of his using neutrons to disturb uranium 235 was that the elements split were far in the middle of the periodic table, and no new element was obtained.

It was not until 1940 that the correct path was obtained.

Among these pioneers, two have indelible merits: Professor Ewdin M. McMillan and Dr. Philip A. Abelson. They obtained a very small amount of "artificial element" when they controlled deuterons with an atom smasher (Cyclotron) in California, USA, to attack uranium oxide. That is the intermediate product of uranium transforming into plutonium—Neptunium. However, due to the small amount, the existence of plutonium could not be pointed out.

At this time, Glern Segreorg, Arthnr C. Wah, Joseph W. Keunedy, and Emilio Segre were also working in the same direction. By the winter of that year, the work of creating plutonium with an atom smasher was officially completed, and they obtained a very small amount of plutonium. Although the amount was pitifully small, scientists were already able to learn about its chemical properties from this and study its changes from radioactivity. An important report was published by Lawrence in May 1941.

This not only opened a new era in the research of new elements but also influenced the research of atomic bombs. Because scientists pointed out that it is very difficult to extract medium uranium (U235), which is the raw material for atomic bombs, from heavy uranium (U238) with only one percent. We do not necessarily need to separate him, but let him automatically split under neutron bombardment and bomb into a new element, which is plutonium. Even though plutonium is relatively stable, it can also obtain huge atomic energy when split. Because when it is hit, it can also automatically disturb, split, and generate new neutrons, which serve as bombardment particles to complete the so-called chain reaction. (To be continued)

Scientific Discussion

### On the Issue of "Digit Grouping"

— Kong Fanqing

After reading Mr. Zhou Shimin's "Sinicization of Digit Grouping" (see Issue 21 of this publication), I couldn't help but be alarmed. Because Mr. Zhou wants to advocate that we use a four-digit grouping system. I think this needs to be reconsidered!

I remember that before 1946, we walked on the left side of the road. After 1946, we changed to walking on the right side. Originally, walking on the left or walking on the right was nothing more than walking in the same direction to avoid facing each other. So? Why change? For no other reason than to have a consistent standard with foreign countries. In today's world of close international exchanges, similar improvements are necessary; they should be actively promoted, and this is the right way. But now Mr. Zhou wants to create this kind of pattern, which is really hard for me to understand. We can think about it. Suppose we use a four-digit grouping system; foreigners will not be able to use the numbers with the grouping points they added. Conversely, foreigners will only be able to recognize the numbers we have grouped with difficulty. At that time, we will suffer the same fate as walking on the left side of the road. Why bother?

Indeed, according to the current trend, our method of recognizing numbers is moving towards a four-digit grouping system. However, we do not have a commonly used four-digit grouping atmosphere. Taking "wan wan wei yi" (ten thousand ten thousands is one hundred million) as "yi" (one hundred million), it was only officially stipulated in 1944. In the past, we also used "shi wan wei yi" (ten ten thousands is one hundred thousand) as "yi."

If we unfold our ancient calculation books, we can also know that the ancient Chinese numbering method, in addition to ge (ones), shi (tens), bai (hundreds), qian (thousands), wan (ten thousands), had three different digits above: The Five Classics Arithmetic, Ji Gu Suan Jing, etc., all talk about digits, saying: "The Yellow Emperor used the law, and the number has ten levels, and its use is three; the ten levels are yi (hundred million), zhao (trillion), jing, gai, zi, rang, gou, jian, zheng, zai. The three levels are shang (upper), zhong (middle), and xia (lower). The lower number is multiplied by ten, as if saying, ten ten thousands is yi, ten yi is zhao, ... The middle number is multiplied by ten thousand, as if saying: ten thousand ten thousands is yi, ten thousand yi is zhao, ... The upper number changes when the number is exhausted, as if saying: ten thousand ten thousands is yi, yi yi is zhao, ..."

From this, we can see that the so-called lower number is only a simple form of the decimal system and does not involve grouping. The upper number is a small cycle of four digits, and the large grouping increases according to a geometric progression, which is not a purely four-digit grouping system. Only the middle number uses four-digit grouping. Because of these three regulations of shang, zhong, and xia, our numbers for thousands of years have been disturbed and have no grouping habits. After the "wan wan wei yi" was stipulated, numbers below nine digits can be said to have formed the meaning of four-digit grouping. What about numbers above nine digits? No one knows whether ten yi is , ten thousand yi is zhao, or yi yi is zhao is the correct one; not to mention the grouping method. And numbers below nine digits only need to be divided into two sections, so of course, it cannot be regarded as a complete four-digit grouping habit.

Since we have no grouping habit, we are now just taking advantage of this trend and creating a confrontation with the existing three-digit grouping system, which is really unnecessary. The three-digit grouping system itself is not worse than the four-digit one; its flow into our country is not like an enemy that has broken our balanced market; why should we treat it as an enemy?

In fact, in 1928, someone had already advocated that we use a three-digit grouping system. Mr. Gao Mengdan's appendix to the "Thirteenth Month Calendar" states: On May 7, 1928, Mr. Duan Fuqun and Mr. Luo Shaoxian talked about the three-digit grouping method, the general idea being:

Although this method has long been forgotten by us, it is indeed a wonderful method to guide us to use a three-digit grouping system.

Therefore, in my humble opinion, we should still use Mr. Duan's three-digit grouping system for our grouping method; its advantages are also three: Easy to remember the rules. Conforms to our country's habits and does not lose the original intention of the sages. Consistent with foreign usage. We can directly recognize the numbers that foreigners have grouped well; foreigners can also directly recognize the numbers that we have grouped well. Everyone spends less brainpower on recognizing numbers.

Now we should advocate academic standardization. It is best to have all mankind adopt one standard and work together to study academic knowledge in the world. It is best to have less closed-door car manufacturing!

Scientific Common Sense

### Beware of Coal Poisoning

— Jia Ling

Most of the residential houses of ordinary people in Shanghai are small and crowded, and there are no heating facilities such as electric furnaces or water heaters. Under the attack of the cold wave, close the windows and doors, light a charcoal fire in the pavilion or厢房 (side room), and sit around to warm up to relieve the severe cold. Or take a bath in the pavilion with a charcoal stove lit. Little do you know that this is suicide! The author has witnessed tragedies, so no matter whether you like to hear it or not, I must ask you to pay attention.

Every winter, there are bound to be several deaths from coal gas poisoning. Even intellectuals and people who are familiar with physics and chemistry may be negligent. Didn't geologist Ding Wenjiang die of coal gas?

Carbon Monoxide Kills Without Blood

Coal cannot burn fully in places where air does not circulate, and carbon monoxide often occurs. In a small room with tightly closed windows, the charcoal stove of course cannot burn fully, and odorless carbon monoxide is produced, which can immediately lead to misfortune. According to E.P, Underhill's report, living in air containing 0.5% carbon monoxide is enough to cause death.

Initially, there is headache and dizziness, the blood vessels in the forehead are dilated and throbbing, and there are symptoms of palpitation and vomiting. The heartbeat is violent, the blood pressure rises, and the face is flushed. Soon after, the pulse is rapid and small, and the breathing is deep and long. As the poisoning deepens, breathing becomes difficult, and the person loses consciousness and falls into a coma. Often, when the poisoning is severe but not yet fatal, the intellect is extremely weak, the thoughts are vague, and the mind is confused, so even if you realize that the poisoning is deep, you want to save yourself, but the mind and body do not allow it. Children are weak and more likely to die.

Carbon monoxide is easily absorbed by the blood when inhaled into the body and produces "Carbon Monoxide Henoglobin," which hinders the transport of oxygen. When various human tissues lack oxygen, they become abnormal. The nervous system is particularly affected, which may cause irreparable damage to the nerves.

Treatment Method

The faster the treatment, the better. The poisoned person should first be moved to fresh air. If breathing stops or is very weak, artificial respiration can be performed, and ammonia gas can be used to stimulate breathing.

The best method is to have the poisoned person inhale a mixture of 5% carbon dioxide and oxygen. Body temperature should be maintained at a normal level, and cardiac stimulants should be given.

Points to Note

1.  Pay attention to air circulation when heating in winter.

2.  If there is sunshine, outdoor games should be played, and do not gather in a small room.

3.  Pay attention to explaining to civilians, especially ignorant housewives, and the merit will be immeasurable.

Scientific Anecdotes

### Nutrition

— Jing Yi

Now that we know the general properties of food, we can examine the relationship between food and life. Some people believe that the characteristics of individuals and races are often determined by the specific foods they consume. Some people even believe that the British ruled India in the past because the British ate more meat, while the Indians ate more vegetarian food. Meat-eating humans walked into the forests, and after fierce battles, they captured those huge vegetarian animals such as cattle and elephants. Some hunters would rather go to the forest to capture lions than go to the pasture to seize the cattle raised by farmers. This may have something to do with the influence of food!

Doctors often say that eating more rice bran can cure beriberi, which is indeed possible because beriberi is entirely caused by a lack of vitamin B. Rice bran contains a lot of this precious ingredient, but unfortunately, most people are unwilling to eat brown rice and cannot get this precious nutrition.

There is also a discussion about digestibility. I will first explain a term: "Digestibility Coefficient." It refers to the amount of food ingested by animals that is finally absorbed and utilized. Usually, carbohydrates are the most completely digested food component because their chemical composition is simpler than that of other compounds. Among proteins, animal proteins are the easiest to digest. Vegetable proteins are second, and the degree of digestion of mixed foods is obviously higher than that of single foods (at present, there is still proof that carbohydrates and proteins are incompatible). Other foods such as starchy foods of shells seem to be more suitable for human digestive tracts and easier to absorb after cooking; however, this cooking does not have any fundamental effect on absorption, it just shortens the digestion time. Because the natural grains are often surrounded by a layer of fibrous sheath, cooking actually softens this layer of lignin and at the same time splits the starch in preparation for the gastric juice to carry out its digestion.

The time it takes for food to pass through the entire digestive tract of a normal person is about 12 to 14 hours. If a considerable amount of food exceeds or falls short of this limit, it is an abnormal phenomenon. After carbohydrates or proteins are mixed with fat, the fat surrounds each particle and must first be emulsified before the digestive juice can enter the process. This digestion time will of course be longer. According to this principle, we can explain why some people do not feel hungry easily after eating oily things such as fried potatoes? This is because these foods are mixtures containing fat, which take a longer time to digest in the stomach, so they can use this to get through the entire morning of hunger.

Of course, after an animal is over-fatigued, a large amount of lactic acid is produced in its body tissues, and its muscles are also relatively weak. In addition, animals that have been severely frightened also have the same phenomenon, so we should also pay attention to this point when selecting meat.

Cook food with an appropriate amount of water (this is the simplest and most important method in cooking because this small matter is closely related to health. The minerals and water-soluble vitamins in food often rely on water to exert their osmotic effect and can enter the marinade. However, vegetables cooked in an excessive amount of water often lose more than 50% of their minerals (such as iron, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, magnesium, iodine and other compounds, liquid), and vitamins not only lose part of them in the solution due to boiling, but also heat has a destructive effect on them. Vitamins are the easiest to be damaged. In addition to being soluble in water, they also vaporize at high temperatures and lose their important effects on human physiology. Therefore, when we eat noodles, the initial noodle soup should not be discarded.

We should consider these food-related common sense and cooking essentials to be most closely related to human health. (To be continued)

### Congratulations and Get Rich

— Ping Zhai

Happily, the fifth day of the Lunar New Year arrives, a fine day for "welcoming the God of Wealth," so everyone should be smiling and saying, "Congratulations and get rich!"

Some might say that "Congratulations and get rich" is too vulgar. Do you not know that refined people of old referred to copper coins as "that thing"? Furthermore, as proof from the legacy of the most holy teacher, there is the saying, "The Master rarely spoke of profit." It's even easier with Mencius – the very first chapter, "Mencius Meets King Hui of Liang," states after only a few sentences, "Only benevolence and righteousness should be spoken of; why must profit be mentioned!" Why is it that in this New Year's article, you have thoroughly and authentically fulfilled those four words, "Once said, it becomes vulgar?"

And so, I must defend myself. It is also a matter of "helplessness."

Let's start with the sages. Confucius is truly respectable and lovable. Just look at those four words, "rarely spoke of profit": "Rarely spoke" does not mean "did not speak," it merely means he didn't have "Congratulations and get rich" on his lips all day long. If one only chooses to say "Congratulations and get rich" to friends during the New Year, wouldn't that be extremely in line with the meaning of "rarely speaking," and perfectly in accordance with the sage's intent? Mencius, when making fun of the people of Qi, already showed a bit of snobbery, and his rank belonged to the "sub" level, his position equivalent to Truman when Roosevelt was alive. There's no need for detailed refutation – you must know that King Hui of Liang was, after all, the ruler of a country, and it was indeed unbecoming for him to immediately seek benefits upon meeting this "old man." However, Mencius's exceptional eagerness upon hearing this precisely reflects the "old man's" sensitivity to the word "profit."

Let's return to discussing Confucius.

Those four words, "rarely spoke of profit," are truly wonderful—the more one thinks about it, the more wonderful they become, their meaning endless. "Rarely speaking" means "not often saying it out loud." What about in the heart? If we think about it from the opposite perspective, we will suddenly realize something. You must know that the opposite of "rarely" is "often," and the opposite of "speaking" is "thinking"!

The reason Confucius is not only respectable but also lovable is precisely because he showed in every way that he was not a "god" with unexpected and unimaginable powers, but a "person"—a "person" who could face reality squarely, possessed a very approachable personality, and had keen wisdom and wit. Why do American businessmen bring up "Confucius said..." when making advertisements? Why does no one pay attention to those solemn-faced Zhou Dunyi, Zhu Xi, or the Cheng brothers? The answer is: the common people under heaven (Man in the street) think similarly. We may have to pay lip service to those solemn-faced great men and gentlemen, but in our hearts, we truly dislike them. We want to get close to those who are willing to get close to us – Confucius is one of them.

The talent of the ancient Chinese in advertising is not inferior to that of Hollywood filmmakers. To persuade people to read, they would say: in books, there are "golden houses," "thousands of bushels of grain," and even "jade-like beauties"! Not only did they deeply understand the sages' intentions regarding the two key points of "food" and "sex," but they even seemed to have a premonition of the housing problem. No wonder some people are willing to risk becoming severely nearsighted and study by reflecting the snow, while others are not afraid of suspicion of theft and steal light by peering at the wall, and still others force open their sleepy eyes and stab their own thighs!

How much would a "golden house" cost to build? How much are "thousands of bushels of grain" worth? And the grey overcoat of a "jade-like beauty" cannot be spared either – otherwise, this "beauty" will be less like "jade" and more like "iron"...

Therefore, reading is a tool, while getting rich is the goal, the principle is extremely clear—"speaking" only once a year can be called "rarely speaking," and so I cannot help but express my thoughts as above.

### Toscanini

— Cheng Juntão

The now immensely popular Italian musician Arturo Toscanini has recently been appointed as a senator by the Italian President Nicola. According to the new Italian constitution, the president can appoint five Italian celebrities from the fields of science, sociology, art, and literature as lifetime senators. Toscanini's new appointment is truly a grand event in the art world.

Toscanini was born on March 25, 1867, in the music-rich city of Parma, Italy. His father was a tailor, and his mother was not a musician, but Toscanini possessed musical genius. From the age of nine, he studied cello at the local music academy, and when he graduated at eighteen, he received an honorary diploma. Afterwards, he participated in performances with various small orchestras.

Toscanini had an exceptionally strong memory for songs. This, combined with his diligence, was the main factor contributing to his later achievements. Once, just hours before the opera "Aida" was to be performed, the orchestra conductor suddenly had a disagreement with the manager and refused to conduct. At that time, the manager accepted a suggestion from an orchestra member and asked Toscanini to serve as the temporary conductor. Toscanini's performance was greatly praised by the audience. At that time, he was only nineteen years old. Afterwards, Toscanini rose rapidly, becoming a world-class conductor. Today, he is hailed as the king of conductors.

In fact, Toscanini is not only an artist with extremely high musical attainments, but also a warrior with a great personality, a love of freedom, and a sense of justice. He hated the Fascists and was unmoved by their coercion and inducements. They had repeatedly forced him to conduct and perform Fascist songs, but he resolutely refused and was even beaten for it. However, this only strengthened his determination to oppose Fascism.

In 1938, all of Italy was in the clutches of Fascism. Toscanini could no longer stay in his homeland. For the sake of the country's future and for the sake of art, Toscanini tearfully went to work in the United States again. Toscanini not only brought sublime European music to America, but also brought the determination of millions of Italian compatriots to fight for justice and freedom to that land of freedom, arousing resonance among the entire American people. Wherever he went, he was warmly welcomed. When this silver-haired artist stood on the conductor's podium of a concert hall or opera house, conducting the performance of music, the audience below, the orchestra he conducted, and the choir all felt it was an supreme honor.

After the establishment of the United Nations organization, the U.S. State Department, in order to conduct grand publicity, asked Toscanini for assistance to shoot a music short film—"The United Nations Anthem." Toscanini adapted the United Nations Anthem into a moving song, conducted and performed by Toscanini, with the elite of choirs from all over the United States serving as the chorus, and the orchestra also assembled outstanding members from various orchestras. The magnificent music and moving songs left a lasting and profound impression on tens of millions of people.

This elderly artist, already eighty years old, is truly vigorous in his old age. Last May, Toscanini was specially invited to return to his country to perform pro bono, raising donations to aid refugees; afterwards, he took the orchestra to London to perform, shaking all of England. Toscanini is currently still the principal conductor of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) Symphony Orchestra, and he is still continuing to work hard to study music.

### On the "Hero" Tojo

— Jing Wen

Some foreign reporters and Japanese people have expressed great surprise and even admiration for Tojo's eloquent defense of the Japanese Emperor and Japanese militarists at the Tokyo International Military Tribunal for the Far East, and his "candid" admission that he "personally" was willing to bear the responsibility for Japan's defeat, while denying that Japan was the instigator of the war. According to reports from Tokyo, the Japanese people's aversion to Tojo in the past two years has now changed, and they believe that although Tojo is a loser, he is still a "hero," or at least a "good man."

Unexpectedly, more than two years after Japan's surrender and before a formal peace treaty has even been established, Tojo has once again become a hero or a good man in the eyes of some Japanese people. And ironically enough, the location of the international tribunal that is being used by Tojo to create his "heroic" background is precisely the location of the "Imperial General Headquarters" where Tojo was in charge and directing the "Greater East Asia Holy War" three years ago!

Hitler's fate remains a mystery to this day, and Mussolini, after his body was once seized by his loyal followers, has long been secretly buried by the Italian authorities. Tojo's position in Japan in the past may not have been as high as that of Hitler and Mussolini, but compared to Goering and Ribbentrop, who were executed by the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, he is much luckier, because he is not only still alive today, but is also using the international tribunal that holds his ultimate fate in its hands to relive his "heroic" dream.

But can Tojo really be considered a "hero"? Judging heroes by success or failure is perhaps not the way of the wise; for example, a figure like Napoleon is a typical failed hero in an individualistic society, because although his ambition was defeated, the evaluations of him by historians and biographers can still evoke some feelings of regret.

But Tojo is definitely not this kind of character. Not to mention that Tojo attempted suicide with a pistol out of fear of punishment at the beginning of Japan's surrender, just seeing him still wearing a copper ring on his middle finger today in the Tokyo court is enough to show what kind of "hero" he is. According to Tojo himself, the reason he wears that string ring (actually just a string looped around his finger) is because he is easily angered, but as long as he sees that string ring, he can restrain himself. Examining his psychology, it is similar to the psychology of the shop assistants or nannies we often see wearing a rubber band on their fingers to indicate that they are abstaining from gambling or playing flower games!

However, these are minor matters. In fact, judging from the character of the Japanese people and their historical background, Japan is by no means a country that can easily produce true heroes. This is not to say that Japan lacks brave and scheming (some of the necessary conditions for a hero) figures; there are plenty of such figures in Japanese history, but it is because the Japanese usually lack romantic feelings and grand aspirations. The Japanese can become one of the most adaptable people in the world, but they are definitely not an ideal breeding ground for heroes. And it is even more out of the question to talk about people like Tojo!

After the Meiji Restoration, Japan once wanted to learn from Europe and the United States, but the Japanese nation and society had their own limitations, so they finally hit a wall; then there was the so-called "Showa Restoration," and at that time, the "model" was German and Italian fascism; in fact, the content of the "Showa Restoration" was more suitable for the character of the Japanese nation than the "Meiji Restoration," but it was also destroyed under the wheels of the atomic age.

Today's Japan is naturally in the custody of the United States, and to say imitation is not so much as flattery; because it is imitation, everything seems unnatural, because it is flattery, everything contains an intention. And this two-in-one characteristic is precisely the essence of modern Japanese culture and its politics. A nation that is good at imitating and flattering in order to adapt to the environment is incapable of producing heroes with imaginative and creative personalities; on the contrary, it is a breeding ground for Machiavellians and opportunists.

Tojo's "eloquence" at the Tokyo International Tribunal, and the Japanese people who regard such an artful Tojo as a "hero," all express the opportunism of the Japanese nation! The Japanese nation also has its strengths and advantages, but unfortunately it is still immersed in the dream of opportunism. The Japanese people with two-sided personalities, tacitly acknowledged by Sato Haruo, still form the mainstream of today's Japanese culture and society.

### Unrestrained Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Six Such a Wonderful Night (32)

After Qi Wan and Zhu Zhai finished drinking a cup of wine, she sighed slightly and said, "I am full of emotion, but since birth, I have never expressed my feelings to anyone. After seeing you, my feelings are different from anyone else. That night I was forced at Shichahai and decided to commit suicide. Unexpectedly, I was rescued by you, and you did not despise me and could understand my hardships. I feel that you are my only confidant in my life. I talked to you in the park last time, leaves fall to the roots, and everyone should have a home. Like me, drifting around is like fallen leaves dancing in the air. I may fall into the mud or into a soft bed. With my current situation, many people are chasing me and want to get close to me, but I know their psychology very well. They don't really love me. They are holding on to the idea of ​​recreation and amusement, so I am only superficially perfunctory to them. Although I am only twenty-two years old this year, I have been running around outside for the past few years and have contacted many people. I have carefully studied everyone's psychology, and only you can understand my painstaking efforts." Zhu Zhai was very moved when he heard this and said, "I admire your art the most. You have been through all kinds of tribulations and can always strive for art. This is most admirable." Qi Wan said, "Don't say anything about admiration. I always feel that you are my only confidant. A confidant is the most difficult to find, so I don't treat you as an outsider and talk about everything. Because I am straightforward and outspoken, I suddenly talked about your marriage problem just now, but it has already become a fact, so there is no need to regret it. Don't let my words cause you any unhappiness." Seeing that Qi Wan had gently said a lot of words, she wanted to explain the marriage problem she had talked about. Maybe she saw all kinds of difficulties, so the meaning in her words changed from enthusiasm to plainness. This was because she was thinking too much. He hurriedly said, "It is because you think highly of me that you talked about the problem, which is also the most difficult problem for me. I am extremely painful about this matter!" Seeing Zhu Zhai frowned when he said this, knowing that he was sad, Qi Wan said, "Let's not talk about this matter now, let's have two more drinks!" She first drank the glass of wine in front of her. Zhu Zhai also accompanied her with a glass, shaking his head and saying, "I have not had a happy day since I got married, let alone now. Just say that today is my birthday. Others must go back and have a gathering with their family. I am not because you are leaving. I would rather spend my birthday outside alone than come back." Qi Wan was slightly startled and said, "Today is your birthday! In that case, I hurriedly prepared a few bowls of simple dishes. I originally wanted to make it a farewell banquet for you and me, but I didn't want to celebrate your birthday for you. Okay, I should respect you with three cups!" She stood up and brought the wine glass to let Zhu Zhai drink. Zhu Zhai stretched out his hand and gently pressed her shoulder and said, "Please sit down! It is no problem for me to drink a few cups, but you have already drunk a lot. I advise you not to drink anymore. Your voice is important!" Qi Wan still held up the glass and stood saying, "It doesn't matter, I still have something to say to you after you drink." Zhu Zhai had no choice but to stand up and take the wine from her hand and drink it. Qi Wan also accompanied him with three cups, pulled him to sit down, and took off a pearl-studded pin from her close-fitting collar and pinned it on Zhu Zhai's tie, smiling slightly, "Today is your birthday. I will give you this as a souvenir!"

### Ode to the New Year

### Sun Yuehan

Happy New Year, Happy New Year,
First kneel before the Bodhisattva's seat.
Prices of everything soar from eighth-grade wood,
New Year's people are older than last year!
Do not be heartbroken by unpacified war flames,
Who cares about the world's affairs like that.
All that is seen before one's eyes is selfish gorging,
The year of Mao has emptied the year of Yin's grain.
Most especially, the neighbor Wang Xiaoer,
A lone carrier seeking trifling profits.
The New Year is worse than the last, year after year,
Husband and wife face each other, shedding tears in cattle clothes!
Peach Blossom Spring starts building a high debt platform,
The cold wind at the end of the year is like scissors.
How can one allow wealthy families to violate thrift?
Willing to follow the powerful to learn fashion?
Firewood, rice, oil, and salt are especially thorny,
The appearance is as weary as a homeless dog.
Life is like a radish striking a golden gong,
The job title is a hunchback flipping somersaults!
Alas, alas, times are difficult, the years are barren, and I am also barren,
Selling articles and paintings is doubly embarrassing.
In a dream, I hug the quilt and shout wildly:
I have picked up a way to ward off evil in the world!

### Plagiarism

— Lei Ke

A plagiarism case has been resolved silently and inconspicuously (that is, compared to the Xiao Danggui case). What I am recording below, however, is an even more inconsequential trivial matter. I happened to talk about plagiarism with a person sitting on the sidelines, and he told me an interesting story about a classroom copycat, which would be a pity not to record.

Once, my friend saw a very good article in a student's composition book and was very proud. He circulated it to his colleagues in the teachers' lounge. When it was the turn of a Chinese teacher from another grade, he! Then he also flipped through the textbook left and right, and sure enough, he found the "original manuscript". Having eyes but not recognizing Mount Tai, it turned out to be an article by a vernacular warrior of the May Fourth era. My friend was very happy, as if someone had helped him catch a pickpocket. Immediately, he called the student over. But the student's face turned red, but said with equal surprise: "Why is it the same as what I wrote?" How could it be the same? He insisted on believing (or rather, insisted) that there was such a coincidence in the world, and when it came to this issue of faith, it was impossible to explain it any further.

My friend told me that there was a reason for this. Once, this student made a scene at the training office, saying that the physical education teacher slapped him. But the physical education teacher did not admit it. However, the student's face was so red that you could almost see "the palm of a giant spirit." The physical education teacher explained: "My hand just swung out like this, and his face just turned over like this. Naturally, the two sides could not avoid touching like this." There is such a coincidence in the world, the training director naturally held the same firm belief as the teacher, and the student had no choice but to retreat silently. This lesson was not without benefit to him, and the above was the first time it came into play.

### Final Accounting of the Eastern Legation Quarter

—

The land and real estate of the Dongjiaomin Lane were officially handed over by the Chinese and foreign responsible authorities before the new year. On the Chinese side were the Mayor of Peiping and the Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, and on the foreign side were five advisors, namely the consuls of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The location was the West Flower Hall of the Municipal Government, at 3:00 PM on December 26th of the 36th year of the Republic of China. The historical significance is quite significant and deserves special attention.

In fact, the so-called "Legation Quarter" of Dongjiaomin Lane ceased to exist four years ago. Although China has taken it back after the restoration, the completion of the formalities and the settlement of everything before that date began on this day and at this time.

The area east of Zhengyang Gate, west to Chongwen Gate, north to Chang'an Street, and south to the city wall was originally inhabited by both Chinese and foreign officials and civilians before the Gengzi Incident. Although there were many foreign legations and overseas merchants, there were also many Chinese official residences and the residences of influential figures. The residence of Xu Tong, a grand scholar and veteran of four dynasties (at that time known as Yin Xuan Xiangguo, the tutor of the Qing Tongzhi Emperor), was in the area. He was a scholar of Neo-Confucianism and deeply resented foreigners. Because his residence was close to the legations, he wrote eight characters on the door: "Sighing over Foreign Favor," "Living Next to Ghosts." Outside the gate, there was a pile of earth like a small mountain, formed by years of windblown sand and garbage. Superstitious people said it was good for the feng shui of the house, a sign of good fortune. The foreigners, however, thought it obstructed traffic and was unhygienic, so they started work to level it. Xu Tong could do nothing about it and hated the foreigners even more. The miscellaneous poems of the Gengzi Incident, "An old Taoist living in a foreign place, cherishing a pile of earth in front of his door," refer to this matter. Xu, a follower of Cheng and Zhu, had a solemn appearance and was known in scholarly circles as "Old Taoist Xu." Because he strongly supported the Boxers, he committed suicide by hanging himself after the Eight-Nation Alliance broke into Beijing, at the age of over eighty.

After the Gengzi Rebellion, the Qing government agreed to move all the government offices and civilian residences outside the area. This piece of land was then managed by the legations themselves. There was a rotating officer on duty at the top and self-managed police and post offices below. At first, they even forbade Chinese people from passing through, citing the reason of protecting the roads. Later, after negotiations with the Qing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they were given a subsidy of five thousand taels of silver each year for road repairs, and they obtained the "right of passage," but large carriages were still restricted. In the event of an incident, traffic would be cut off first. After the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, the city of Beijing was in a panic, and the Dongjiaomin Lane was placed under martial law, with the east, west, and north sides sealed off for several months. After that, during events such as the Restoration War, the Zhili-Anhui War, the two Zhili-Anhui Wars, and other disturbances, the Dongjiaomin Lane would immediately close its iron gates and protect itself. Its surrounding walls had gun emplacements, resembling battlements, with a solemn atmosphere. The city residents called it the "Foreign Forbidden City," even more imposing than the "Chinese Forbidden City" (the Forbidden City).

Because of several civil wars among the warlords, the flames of war reached the city, and the citizens were like startled birds. At the first sign of alarm, they rushed to the Dongjiaomin Lane to rent temporary houses to avoid disaster. But the foreigners said that this was different from the Legation Quarter and the Tianjin Concession, and the restrictions were extremely strict. Because there were many foreign firms and residences, except for the Six Nations Hotel and a few other hotels and hospitals, which had already been taken over, people could only resort to using the Western clerks to find ways. Even a single permanent house or a woodshed could fetch a high price. At that time, foreign firms also used safe deposit boxes, rented out by number, where valuable property could be deposited. Therefore, in times of chaos, the Dongjiaomin Lane was a gold mine. The city residents knew that they were spending money and being treated badly, but they had no choice. Moreover, this was only something merchants could do; ordinary people could only look on in envy.

The area east of Chongwen Gate, north to Dongdan Archway on the east city wall, was commonly called the "Protected Area," and formally known as "Second Dongjiaomin Lane." It was neither a concession nor a legation quarter. Although it was under Chinese police jurisdiction, there were foreign residences, foreign firms, hospitals, newspapers, hotels, and brothels. People of various countries lived scattered in the alleys, so it was full of foreign atmosphere. Moreover, because this area was in the east of the Legation Quarter and was located in a corner, even if there were military affairs in the suburbs, there was the "Foreign Forbidden City" to act as a screen, so the residents could "sleep soundly without worry." The price of houses and land in this area was four or five times more expensive than in other areas. Advertisements for sale or rent specifically marked the words "Within the Protected Area" as a reason for demanding high prices. In times of chaos, the house owners' hoarding and extortion were no different from those in the concessions. It was a strange phenomenon and a sad history, but now it has all become a thing of the past.

Economically, since the large railway nationalization loan in the former Qing Dynasty, the large post-war loan in the Republic of China, and various other large and small loans, the "banking group" in the Legation Quarter was the center of it all. The British HSBC, the French Credit Lyonnais, and the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank all occupied a dominant position in the Chinese financial world. Those large buildings were also towering in Dongjiaomin Lane.

Politically, there was also the term "Diplomatic Corps," which was called the "Supreme Government" during the Beiyang government era. The losers of each coup, such as Zhang Xun who restored the Qing dynasty, hid in the Dutch legation, and the ten arch-criminals of the Anfu Clique, Liang Hongzhi, Xu Shuzheng, Zhu Shen, etc., all hid in the cellars of the Japanese barracks for years. Therefore, this area also became a place for fugitives.

In the two or three years after the July 7th Incident, the Japanese still had some scruples about the Legation Quarter. Until a year before the start of the Pacific War, they gradually provoked Britain and the United States. Until the outbreak of war, they occupied the British and American legations with their troops, and the officials of other countries were terrified under the evil flames for more than a year. Then, in the form of returning it, they handed it over to the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, but in reality it was still controlled by the Japanese.

Now it is stipulated as a part of the municipal property under the jurisdiction of the Land Administration Bureau (the land within the quarter that various countries are allowed to continue to use for official purposes is subject to a new agreement). Thus, this special zone that symbolized "inequality" for fifty years has once again become the "clean land" of China. Its significance is even greater than the recovery of the concessions, which is something that anyone with a little historical knowledge can understand.
