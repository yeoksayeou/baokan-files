[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 24th] The battle for Xinlitun, a transportation hub and military stronghold in western Liaoning, has entered a critical stage. Although the outer strongholds have almost all been lost, the National Army is making every effort to defend it.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] Xinlitun Still Held. After a part of the communist bandits broke through strongholds such as Xiaohuangjintai and Fanjiawopeng on the afternoon of the 23rd, the battle gradually unfolded around the station. The morale of the defending troops is high, and they are steadfastly defending their positions, fiercely attacking the stubborn bandits.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 24th] The communist bandits on the periphery of Jilin have been scattered and routed one after another after being encircled and suppressed by the National Army in various places in recent days. The area around Jilin has now become peaceful.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Sources close to the government reported from the Northeast on the 24th: The battle for Xinlitun has reached a new peak.

It is claimed that the communist bandits have occupied many high grounds overlooking the city from the north and south. Suicide squads from the bandit side braved the National Army's artillery fire, charging towards the urban area every hour. Hand-to-hand combat has also begun. However, the National Army still occupies the mountainous area of Xinlitun, and the communist bandits' attempt to attack Shuangshanzi failed. The number of communist bandits attacking the city has increased to 30,000, and Xinlitun is isolated.

American Newspaper Reporter Reports After Visiting Suiyuan and Returning to Beiping: Outer Mongolian Army Invades Inner Mongolia, Forcibly Occupying Two Important Locations in Northwest Suiyuan

[United Press, Beiping, 24th] Tracy, a correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, who had traveled to Suiyuan, just returned to Beiping and told a United Press reporter today that Outer Mongolia, a vassal state of the Soviet Union, has not only invaded Inner Mongolia, but has even surrounded it. He has obtained much evidence. Since the end of the Sino-Japanese War, no Chinese troops have dared to advance within fifty miles of the Outer Mongolian border. According to Mongolians, there are Outer Mongolian border guards every few miles. Outer Mongolia has occupied at least two important military locations in northwestern Suiyuan and established defenses, one being the Daolisu district and the other being the Soron Mountains near Ningxia. Tracy arrived at a Chinese military outpost in Inner Mongolia eighty miles south of Outer Mongolia. When the Soviet and Outer Mongolian armies withdrew from Bailingmiao and other places in 1945, they took away 300 Inner Mongolian youths, who are still being indoctrinated with communism in Kulun. Outer Mongolian raiding teams often patrol the grasslands of Suiyuan and Chahar, attempting to lure Inner Mongolian youths out of the country. The snow and ice in northern Suiyuan prevent cattle, horses, and sheep from obtaining dry grass, further increasing the poverty of the Mongolians within China. According to the Mongolians, they have not received medical and food relief from China and the United Nations, but it is heard that Mr. Shateji has taken food and medicine there (Note: Mr. Sha is the chairman of the Inner Mongolia Relief Examination Committee). An observation from the south bank of the Yellow River (Hetao) reveals that hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese and Mongolians are suffering from famine. It is reported that Fu Zuoyi is now protecting the rear with militia, but there is a lack of ammunition and training. Although there are no bandits in Suiyuan in practice, the entire territory is very poor due to the war and the stagnation of commerce between Inner and Outer Mongolia. However, everyone speaks well of Fu Zuoyi.

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 23rd] The bandits who harassed Lanshan and Linwu from the border area of Hunan and Guangdong have fled towards Guangdong after being intercepted by the police force.

### American Newspaper Author Reveals Insider Information on Communist Activities: Holding Meetings in the United States to Oppose Our Government

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] Wolman, an author for the World Telegram known for exposing Communist activities, recently revealed the insider information on the Communist Party's plan for the "American National Conference on China's Far Eastern Policy" to be held here this weekend. Wolman won the Pulitzer Prize last year for his article in the World Telegram exposing Communist infiltration into American labor and political organizations. He said today that although the name of the above-mentioned conference is very peaceful and without inflammatory elements, it is actually entirely created by the Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee of the Communist Front. The committee has always strived to realize the Soviet Union's desires in Asia. The National Policy Conference claims that its purpose is to promote national "citizen activity" in order to correct policies towards China, Japan, and Korea, but according to Wolman, the purpose of the conference is specifically to oppose the Chinese National Government. According to information obtained by Wolman in advance, the conference will accuse the United States of creating the false independence of the Philippines, causing "economic chaos and political fascism" in Korea, equipping the Japanese army, and planning to subject the Chinese people to autocratic politics. In short, the United States will be accused of causing all the disasters in the Far East, while the Soviet Union will appear in East Asia with a clean slate. Wolman said, "The most ambitious national communist front" launched this conference here a few days ago. The conference is scheduled to be held on the evening of the 23rd, starting with a mass gathering aimed at criticizing "America's secret diplomacy in China." The main speakers at the conference include Ms. Strong and Dr. Wen Youzhang. According to Wolman, Ms. Strong is the founder of the English-language Moscow Daily News and has been active between the United States and the Soviet Union for many years as a Soviet propagandist. Wen Youzhang, on the other hand, "participated in the communist forces in China" and recently resigned from his position as a missionary in Chengdu. Wolman pointed out that the American Communist Party has publicly congratulated this conference. It is said that the list of conference planners, in addition to some new figures, includes 70 well-known figures from the Communist Front. Other speakers are very familiar in China. They include Pearson, who recently served as a special advisor to MacArthur, Field, the so-called "Communist Party Treasurer," and Kahn, a writer on Far Eastern issues. Among the non-Communist planners of the conference is Professor Tugwell, one of the late President Roosevelt's brain trusters. He once served as Governor of Puerto Rico. According to the Communist Daily Worker, Feng Yuxiang will attend the conference as an "observer" on behalf of Li Jishen's so-called "Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee" in Hong Kong. The newspaper also stated that Feng Yuxiang was "instructed" by Li Jishen to attend.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 24th] The Democratic League issued a statement today stating: "The purpose of the Democratic League will never change, but the method of achieving its purpose must be different from what was decided at the previous meeting.

### The Election of Supervisors in Beiping, Ningxia, and Henan Is Invalid

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The pre-election of supervisors in Beiping City and the two provinces of Ningxia and Henan, and those already elected, have been discussed at the State Council meeting on the 23rd. The resolution deemed it invalid, because the election voting date for the supervisors produced by each province and city was originally November 22nd. Later, because that day coincided with the voting day of the National Assembly elections, it was decided to postpone it for one month. Subsequently, the Youth Party Zeng Qi and the Democratic Socialist Party Zhang Junmai both believed that they had not been formally nominated, and had not been consulted or coordinated by the three parties. The usual practice was to postpone it for another month. Now that Beiping, Ningxia, and Henan have all been elected, they should be consulted by the three parties and declared invalid.

### We Have Made Great Progress on the Road to Democracy, Wu Shangying Talks in America

[Agence France-Presse, San Francisco, 23rd] Wu Shangying, Secretary-General of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, who led a delegation from the Chinese Legislative Yuan to visit Europe and the United States for six months, said here on the 23rd, before leaving for China, that he had met with U.S. President Truman and British Prime Minister Attlee. He said, "China has made great progress on the road to democracy, but there is still much work to be done. Communism is a common problem for the world, and China is only one front in the fight against communism. We are planning to stop communism in China, but we must use both economic and military means to achieve success. Simply suppressing communism with military force will not succeed. The Chinese government does not intend to consider appeasing the Communist Party, but hopes for American assistance to solve this problem." Wu also said: China's first Legislative Yuan election is similar to the American Congress, although we have the strongest political party, other parties also have the opportunity to compete. The Chinese are tending towards democracy, but the road has to be slower. The big problem of illiteracy, the plight of the masses living in hardship, and the centuries-old old-fashioned agriculture must all be solved one by one before China can have a truly democratic government. However, I have great confidence in the example of the government and the United States.

### Chairman Concerned About the People's Suffering in North China, to Receive Petitioners Tomorrow to Hear Report

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Chairman Chiang will receive five representatives from the North China Petition Delegation at 11:30 AM on the 26th to hear direct reports on the overall political and military situation in North China, as well as public opinion and the people's suffering. The Petition Delegation had no major activities on the 24th, other than visiting senior figures from the North in Nanjing. In the afternoon, they consulted with the Nanjing Municipal Assembly, and in the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by Chief Secretary Wu Wendingchang. They are scheduled to hold further talks with the Executive Yuan the day after tomorrow regarding the return of the Mentougou coal mine.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Spokesperson of the Ministry of Food stated: The speakers of the Hebei, Peiping, and Tianjin Provincial Assemblies, along with representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, came to Nanjing to petition for a solution to the North China economic crisis. During discussions with Minister of Food Yu, it was reported that a permit fee of 150,000 yuan was required for each bag of flour transported from Shanghai to Peiping and Tianjin. This increased the cost for grain merchants, leading to higher prices that citizens found difficult to bear. Minister Yu explained that, according to Article 5 of the "Regulations for the Management of Food Circulation" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the Ministry determines the total amount of flour that can be transferred monthly from flour mills in various provinces and cities along the Yangtze River. This amount is allocated to the Flour Association in each region, based on the actual production of each member factory in that region. The allocation and the quantity to be transported to each sales location are then reported to the Ministry, which in turn informs the customs to release the goods. Legal grain merchants must negotiate and purchase flour within the allocated quota from each factory, and the factory is not allowed to raise prices or engage in speculation. The Ministry has no regulation requiring any permit fee for the transfer of flour. If flour mills deliberately raise prices, collect extra permit fees, or collect fees under false pretenses when negotiating quota transfers, such actions are illegal. He asked that if anyone had evidence, they should provide it so that the Ministry could send personnel to investigate thoroughly and take legal action. The Ministry has already dispatched three officials to investigate this matter in various regions. (News of Food Minister Yu Feipeng's arrival in Shanghai is published on page 4).

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Xu Gongrang and others, supervisors dispatched by the Ministry of Food to Shanghai to investigate the collection of permit fees for flour transported from Shanghai to Peiping and Tianjin, left Nanjing by train at approximately 4:00 PM on the 24th. They are determined to begin their work within a short period and return to Nanjing to report promptly.

### Siam Prohibits Overseas Chinese Schools from Displaying National Flag, Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Considers Countermeasures, Decision on Whether to Recognize Current Siamese Government is Temporarily Deferred

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Regarding the Siamese government's violation of treaty obligations (Ambassador Li Tiehzeng had signed an agreement with the previous Siamese government regarding the selection of overseas Chinese education matters), and the renewed prohibition of overseas Chinese schools in Siam from displaying the national flag, an official from the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters on the 24th that the Ministry has received the report and is carefully studying the attitude to be adopted. The claim in the evening newspapers in Nanjing that the government will protest to Siam is completely wrong. Although China still has an embassy in Bangkok, it has not yet recognized the current Siamese government, making it impossible to conduct negotiations. In response to a reporter's question about whether the government is considering recognizing the current Siamese government and conducting negotiations with it, the official replied, "There is nothing I can tell you about this matter at the moment." This "moment" is quite suggestive.

### President Chang Discusses with Foreign Reporters, Time Not Ripe for Currency System Reform, Our Foreign Exchange Measures Can Already Curb the Black Market

[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] President Chang Chun met exclusively with reporters from this agency on the afternoon of the 24th, stating that the time for China to implement currency system reform is not yet ripe. The Executive Yuan has been considering financial reform for quite some time, and various government ministries are drafting measures to cope with China's current financial and economic crisis. President Chang further stated that the government's foreign exchange control policy will not change, and current measures are already able to curb black market activities. Once the recently signed anti-smuggling agreement between China and Hong Kong is fully effective, foreign exchange black market transactions can be completely eliminated. Foreign exchange controls can be applied for a long period of time; Britain has successfully implemented such controls during its current financial crisis. Regarding American aid, President Chang expressed that loans of any size are most welcome by China. Chang also said that the Chinese technical advisory group led by Bei Zuyi has not yet submitted a report from Washington, but the group has been in contact with the State Department, and he anticipates that the United States will provide China with some financial assistance. President Chang then discussed the new economic plan under consideration by the government, pointing out that certain restrictions are absolutely necessary to maintain the balance of the budget for the current fiscal year. Imports of essential goods should be handled as much as possible through barter trade to save foreign exchange. The government will also strive to expand exports, and if necessary, the government will purchase goods domestically and export them overseas, as the New Zealand government has done. China will strive to balance imports and exports, and the newly revised import and export plan will greatly help to balance this year's budget. When asked about the amount needed to stabilize the national currency, President Chang declined to disclose anything, saying that the estimated figures published in the newspapers were purely speculative and did not represent the government's opinion. He stated that the plan to stabilize the national currency is still under close review, and no figures can be provided at this time. When discussing possible currency system reforms, President Chang stated that the government is considering more than two reform systems, but he was unwilling to say whether China would adopt the gold standard system recommended by Kung Hsiang-hsi. Chang denied that the Chinese government is in talks with the Mexican government to purchase silver. He said, "I did not know about this plan until I learned about it from the newspapers. The government has not formally contacted the Mexican government; this is another speculative claim." Chang further confirmed that China's legal tender issuance has exceeded 28 trillion yuan. Finally, President Chang expressed his confidence, stating that "China's future is bright. Britain was able to overcome its difficulties during and after the war, and China will also become stronger after overcoming its current crisis. However, the Chinese people still need to work harder and show the spirit of struggle that the British people showed during difficult times."

### Reforming the Monetary System and Stabilizing Prices

Inflation has reached such a stage that only currency reform can save the situation. Recently, the talk of currency reform has been rampant, and many people have advocated for immediate reform. The greatest purpose of currency reform is to stabilize the value of the currency, and whether the new currency value can be stabilized and whether the reform technique is appropriate are certainly important, but the basic conditions for reform are even more important. Currency reform can certainly help stabilize prices and restore balance to the general economic situation, but it does not mean that once the currency system is reformed, all economic problems can be automatically and fundamentally solved. It still depends on positive measures in all aspects of the economy. In other words, only with the existence of good basic conditions can currency reform have complete success. Otherwise, if the basic conditions are unfavorable, the reform may be in vain, and even if it is effective, it will only be temporary. Currency reform is of great importance to the economic future, so the basic conditions should be carefully considered, and the authorities should be determined to correct the current economic situation so that it can be promoted in conjunction with currency reform measures in order to achieve the practical effect of stabilizing prices and revitalizing the economy.

In the past, the authorities have repeatedly changed their countermeasures for price measures, but all have been ineffective. Not only have they failed to suppress prices, but they have not even been able to slow down the rise in prices. In the past year alone, there were three periodic price surges and several minor price surges. Prices continued to rise, the magnitude of the increase expanded, and the rest period shortened, causing economic turmoil and making people's lives unbearable. Even the current credit tightening policy, although more reasonable, can only have a temporary effect. The current credit tightening policies are: ① Stopping loans from national banks, but because loans account for a very small proportion of the circulating funds in the industrial and commercial sectors, the amount of money that can be tightened by stopping loans is very limited. ② Restricting domestic remittances, as the large-scale collection of funds from various regions in Shanghai promotes the flooding of money, which is a major driving force for price fluctuations. Restricting domestic remittances can certainly have a tightening effect on money, but this effect is offset after the phenomenon of transporting cash occurs. ③ Selling materials, because the quantity is relatively large, the amount of money that can be tightened is also larger, but ultimately the quantity is limited and cannot fully absorb the increased currency issuance. If the sale of old materials could fully absorb the increased currency issuance, then the fiscal deficit would not have to be covered by issuance, but could be offset by the proceeds from the sale of old materials. ④ Banning the black market for gold and banknotes, in the hope of reducing the stimulus of gold and banknote fluctuations on materials, but the black market for gold and banknotes can never be completely eliminated by administrative pressure. It depends on a reasonable change in foreign exchange policy. If the ban is ineffective, the disturbing factors for prices will still exist, and if the ban is effective, floating capital will inevitably turn to the commodity market. ⑤ Inspecting the business of banks and firms, even if it is effective, can only control a small portion of social funds, and its effect is self-evident.

The price problem is so serious that no minor measures can be effective. Even the current credit tightening policy can only have a temporary effect and cannot be sustained. Therefore, we can say that under the legal tender system, prices are no longer stable. However, the economic crisis cannot be allowed to continue, and a solution must be found urgently. Therefore, currency reform is indeed imminent. Although currency reform can give hope for an improvement in the economic situation, it does not mean that once the reform is implemented, the price problem can be fundamentally solved and reach a stable state. Because the factors contributing to the price problem are extremely complex: ① the excessive fiscal deficit, ② the decline in production, ③ the imbalance in foreign exchange supply and demand, and ④ the acceleration of currency circulation. These problems are indeed difficult to solve, so how can they be automatically eliminated after currency reform? Because currency reform itself cannot fundamentally improve finance or increase foreign exchange income, it only alleviates the crisis to facilitate the advancement of rescue work. Under the legal tender system, there is not even this opportunity for improvement.

If, after currency reform, the fundamental correction of the economic situation is not carried out, then this reform will only be a change of units, what is the meaning of that? If inflation continues after the reform, then prices will still not be stable, because the end of inflation can only be realized after the fundamental problems are resolved. Currency reform is a major economic undertaking, and we must not allow the adverse economic situation to undermine it after the reform. We must thoroughly correct the economic status quo and help the success of currency reform. We strongly support currency reform and also hope that it will be successful soon so that the economy can get on the road to recovery and the threat to people's lives can be eliminated. However, in stabilizing prices after currency reform, we should give more consideration and would like to offer a few suggestions for reference.

First, price stability cannot be achieved after currency reform. The most important thing is whether the balance of financial revenue and expenditure can be achieved. Therefore, the first prerequisite for currency reform is to actively reorganize finances in order to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure. After currency reform, the tax law can be made more practical, and the tax revenue can be substantially increased due to the elimination of the lag in tax revenue purchasing power. On the expenditure side, it is no longer necessary to infinitely expand due to price fluctuations, and the budget figures are closer to actual needs, which should be beneficial to improving the financial revenue and expenditure situation. However, looking at the current budget, even if prices are completely stable and the budget is strictly implemented, there will still be a huge gap in financial revenue and expenditure. How to make up for this deficit is a very important issue. If it is not made up for properly and is covered by issuance again, then the reformed new currency system will soon be on the road to expansion again. Therefore, currency reform only gives financial revenue and expenditure an opportunity to improve, but it cannot improve finance itself. We must actively use all possible methods and take advantage of this opportunity to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure, and then use the balance of financial revenue and expenditure to consolidate the foundation of the new currency system. Balancing financial revenue and expenditure is indeed not easy. We must be determined to implement the following necessary measures: ① strictly implement the budget so that the expenditure situation can be controlled. ② Open up new taxes to increase tax revenue, but the burden of the new taxes should be limited to the wealthy class. The current practice of avoiding the important and focusing on increasing indirect tax rates is of no use. ③ Cut and merge redundant institutions to reduce unnecessary expenditures in order to be closer to the revenue. ④ The fiscal deficit should no longer be covered by issuance, and the policy of raising debts should be adopted instead. Issuing public bonds may not be easy after currency reform, but it can be done if a higher interest rate is offered. ⑤ The overdraft of the national treasury to the Central Bank can only be limited to temporary shortfalls, and the amount of the overdraft must also be limited so as not to affect currency inflation.

Second, at the same time as currency reform, the exchange rate must be reasonably adjusted. Improper adjustment will inevitably cause economic turmoil, and the new currency system will ultimately fail. If the exchange rate is set too low, not only will the trade deficit increase and foreign exchange be lost, making it difficult to maintain, but the large-scale import of foreign goods can certainly help lower domestic prices, but industry will also fall into decline. In order to adapt to the future environment, it is better to underestimate the new exchange rate than to overestimate it. Underestimation can save foreign exchange and make currency reform easier to succeed. The adjustment of the exchange rate is still a technical issue, and whether it can achieve lasting stability depends on the reasonable adjustment of the international balance of payments. In the future, strict import controls must still be adopted to reduce foreign exchange expenditures, and active exports and absorption of overseas Chinese funds must be used to increase foreign exchange funds. In particular, capital flight must be thoroughly stopped to prevent the balance of international payments from being disrupted. If the international balance of payments cannot be balanced, even if the exchange rate is reasonable, it will not be stable for long. How can prices be stable if the exchange rate is not stable? Although the exchange rate and prices are mutually causal and cyclical, if the exchange rate can be stabilized, prices can also have a more stable factor.

Third, the current imbalance in the supply and demand of materials is indeed a major factor in price volatility. Even if currency issuance is stopped and the exchange rate is stabilized, the imbalance in the supply and demand of materials will still disrupt price stability. To restore the balance of material supply and demand, the only way is to increase production and save consumption. To increase production, the most important thing is to ensure the supply of raw materials, and everything else is just an auxiliary method. We ask the authorities to restrict the import of finished products and temporarily suspend the import of non-essential goods, and use all foreign exchange positions to import raw materials as much as possible to alleviate the current serious panic over the lack of raw materials. Saving consumption cannot be achieved by orders alone. It must be done practically in order to be beneficial to reality. Furthermore, artificial needs such as speculative hoarding must be effectively curbed. As for curbing, it must not be like in the past. Heavy penalties must be used in troubled times, otherwise it will not be effective. With a sufficient supply of materials, even if there is still a slight increase in issuance at the beginning of currency reform, the inflationary trend can be resisted by it, so it can play a major role in currency reform.

Fourth, the acceleration of currency circulation is the result of people's loss of confidence in the monetary system. This is why the current rate of price increase far exceeds the rate of currency issuance. If the speed of circulation can be reduced, the rate of price increase can be greatly slowed down. This is the case now, and it is even more important during currency reform. Some people believe that currency reform will drastically reduce the speed of currency circulation, but judging from the current lack of interest in the monetary system, it will probably be difficult to achieve the ideal in the future. In order to reduce the speed of currency circulation during currency reform, active measures must be taken. Freeze part of the floating capital to weaken the activity of the floating capital; raise interest rates to tighten credit; encourage the increase of capital in industry and commerce to absorb part of the floating capital into production.

In short, relying solely on currency reform without making efforts in other aspects will still be difficult to be effective. Therefore, these four points are specifically put forward as a reference for policy implementation during currency reform.

### Statements from the Burmese Ambassador to China

(Continued from page one) Yesterday, Mr. U met with reporters at the International Hotel and stated: The Chinese in Burma are very friendly with the Burmese people, and their relationship is extremely close. Over the years, no disputes have ever occurred. My visit here is to seek to bring the people of the two countries even closer and more friendly. He also said: Currently, there are approximately one million Chinese in Burma, including those of mixed Chinese-Burmese descent. Most of them take pride in opening shops, and some are technicians and carpenters. The educational level of the Chinese in Burma is also quite high, and they are free to enter any school. At the same time, there are also Mandarin language schools. In Burma, 95 percent of the population is literate.

Regarding Sino-Burmese trade, Mr. U stated that due to transportation difficulties after the war, the trade volume between the two countries has decreased by about half compared to before the war. However, he believes that it will definitely increase in the future, and he will also do his best to promote progress during his visit to China. The Burma Road is still passable, but there is a lack of transportation. In the past, Burma mainly purchased cotton yarn from China, while China imported mostly raw cotton from Burma, as well as a small amount of grain.

Mr. U also stated that the biggest difficulty Burma has encountered after the war is the lack of transportation. Railways were destroyed during the war, resulting in heavy losses. In addition, the labor problem is also extremely serious, with wages being four times higher than before the war, making it difficult for production to compete with other countries. As for clothing and food, they can still cope. According to his estimation, the reconstruction of Burma will take five years if "luck is good," but it will not exceed ten years at the latest.

Mr. U studied law at Cambridge University in London in his early years. Before becoming ambassador, he served as the president of the Rangoon Court. During the war, he served in the Burmese Army.

### Australia Celebrates National Day Tomorrow: Copeland's Declaration Pays Tribute to China

[British News Agency, this city] The 26th is Australia's National Day. Professor Copeland, the Australian Minister to China, issued a National Day declaration, in which he highly praised China's heroic achievements in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The declaration stated: "On behalf of the Australian government and people, I would like to extend my congratulations to the leaders and people of the Republic of China, and hope that China will complete its unification and construction before the next Australian National Day. Without China's unification, there can be no peace and progress in the hemisphere we live in. The Australian people deeply admire the Chinese people for being the first to independently resist Japan. Australia is honored to have participated in the Pacific War and ultimately defeated the enemy. Without China's eight-year War of Resistance, Australia would not have been able to defend against the enemy and would undoubtedly have been conquered. Australia's ability to avoid the humiliation of invasion is due to the Chinese people's heroic resistance, which restrained a large amount of the enemy's material and human resources. Otherwise, Australia's independence and security would have been severely threatened. On this National Day, Australia cannot help but express its gratitude and admiration to the Chinese government and people for their eight years of arduous resistance."

### Yangtze River Shipping is Calm, Shallow Water Slows Journey

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 24th] Although there have been rumors of Communist activities along the Yangtze River for several weeks, the reporter did not encounter any danger along the way today while traveling by steamer from Hankou to Nanjing. The biggest danger to Yangtze River shipping is shallow water, not the Communists, which means that a journey that normally takes three days from Hankou to Nanjing now takes more than five days. There are no signs of Communist activity along the river, and there were no guards stationed on the ship the reporter was on.

### Freight Cars Collide at Qu County Station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway

One Driver and One Brakeman Injured

[This newspaper, Qu County, 24th] At around 6:00 AM on the 23rd, freight car number 2112, carrying salt and traveling west, arrived at Qu County Station. While shunting cars, freight car number 2112, which departed from Shangrao, had already left Houxi Street Station. After being notified, Qu County Station telegraphed Houxi Street Station to order car number 2112 to delay entering the station to avoid an accident. At 7:02 AM, as car number 2112 was being towed by locomotive number 113 and approaching the tracks, car number 2112 also approached at the same time. Due to the cloudy weather and heavy fog, the visibility of both drivers was obstructed. The driver of car number 2112 assumed that there were no obstacles ahead and continued forward. In an instant, the two cars collided. Locomotive number 113 of car number 2112 was subjected to a strong impact, and due to its smaller size, it jumped into the air and landed on top of the first salt car, number 470979. Locomotive number 113 was severely damaged and difficult to repair. One driver in the car was thrown out of the car and suffered a left shoulder injury. A brakeman in the guard car suffered a chest injury and was seriously injured. They were immediately transported to Jinhua for treatment. Dozens of meters of track were destroyed near the tracks. After the accident, all employees were mobilized to rush repairs, and traffic was not restored until 5:35 PM. Director Hou Jiayuan of the railway bureau happened to be taking the express train to Nanchang on business that day. After arriving at the station and hearing the news, he was furious at the severity of the accident, which was unprecedented on the railway. He immediately got out of the car to investigate the truth and sent Chen Youzhu, the stationmaster on duty, to Hangzhou for investigation. Mr. Hou boarded the original train and entered Jiangxi at 6:40 PM that afternoon.

### Additional Special Trains to Hometowns on the Jinpu Railway's Pukou-Bengbu Section

Timetable Adjusted for Yuehan Railway

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] To facilitate travelers returning to their hometowns for the Lunar New Year, the Jinpu Railway will add two third-class special local trains between Pukou and Bengbu every day from the 25th to February 9th.

### Continued Trial of U.S. Military Officer Graham's Smuggling Case

Tianjin Customs Commissioner Testifies in Court

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] The trial of U.S. Marine Corps officer Graham's smuggling case continued in Tianjin on the 24th. Shou Wen, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, was specially invited to testify in court. Mr. Shou explained in detail the Chinese government's customs import regulations and stated that the defendant Graham had imported two cars in January 1947 in his capacity as a U.S. military officer. One car was imported duty-free in accordance with government regulations, while the other was taxed by the customs. His intention may have been to sell the car immediately after import, because according to Chinese government regulations, every U.S. military officer, as certified by his superior officer and his consul, is allowed to import one car duty-free. The customs inspectors signed and released the cars because they did not realize that the two owners were the same person. However, although the military officer had imported the cars, he still violated Chinese customs regulations. Later, Zhang Runsheng, the acting deputy director of the Tianjin District Office of the Import and Export Control Committee, was invited to inquire about the import regulations. The plaintiff's witnesses have finished testifying, and the defendant still needs to summon other witnesses. The case will be heard again on the 26th.

### Measures for Prioritized Purchase or Lease of Enemy and Puppet Factories Not Sold in Two Auctions

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The measures for prioritized purchase or lease of enemy and puppet factories not sold in two auctions in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas by relocated factories from the rear areas, after being revised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office of the Central Trust Bureau, have been presented to the Executive Yuan for amendment and approval. The measures are as follows:

① Enemy and puppet factories and factory equipment that have not been sold after being auctioned more than twice may be prioritized for purchase or lease by relocated factories from the rear areas.

② Purchasers or lessees are limited to private factories that have made a real contribution to wartime production during the War of Resistance and must be registered with the Ministry.

③ The qualifications of the purchaser or lessee shall be certified by the National Industrial Association or the United Association of Factories Relocated to Sichuan and Guangxi and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. If two or more parties apply to purchase or lease the same enemy and puppet factory, the above two associations shall determine the order of priority, which shall be reviewed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to determine the purchaser or lessee. The first priority shall be given to specialized factories over non-specialized factories, and the second priority shall be given to two or more parties jointly applying over one factory applying alone.

④ In accordance with the Executive Yuan's decree, the measures for relocated factories from the rear areas to purchase or lease enemy and puppet factories are divided into four items: ① Pay in full within one month according to the valuation of the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office. ② Pay 80% in full within one month according to the valuation of the Clearing Office. ③ Pay one-third first according to the valuation of the Clearing Office, pay another one-third within three months, and pay the remaining amount within another three months. ④ Leasing measures are specified separately.

⑤ Applicants may choose one of the four methods stipulated in Article 4 to apply, but the approved priority order is as follows: those who pay in full at once have the highest priority, followed by those who pay 80% at once, followed by those who pay in installments, and then those who lease.

⑥ The leasing measures are as follows: (A) The leased objects are limited to factory buildings, land, and machinery and equipment. The remaining finished products, raw materials, and tools shall be sold to the lessee at market prices on a priority basis. (B) The rent shall be calculated by combining the interest on the price and the depreciation of use. The interest shall be calculated at a monthly rate of one cent per thousand based on the estimated price of the leased object, and the depreciation shall be calculated according to the depreciation rate stipulated in the Income Tax Law. (C) The lease term is limited to two years. (D) No extension is allowed upon expiration. The lessee shall have priority to purchase it in full at once according to the estimated price at that time, multiplied by the depreciation rate. If they are unwilling to purchase, it shall be auctioned.

⑦ The application procedures for purchase or lease shall be handled by the National Industrial Association entrusted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in conjunction with the United Association of Factories Relocated to Sichuan and Guangxi. Matters such as accepting applications, certifying qualifications, and suggesting priority order shall be handled separately.

⑧ After the purchaser or lessee is approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and submitted to the Clearing Office for approval, they shall fill out a letter of intent, pay the money, sign a contract, and go through the handover procedures in accordance with the old factory measures at the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office.

⑨ After purchasing or leasing, the purchaser or lessee shall actively resume work. The purchaser and the lessee shall not sublet, resell, or sublease.

⑩ The list of factories that have not been sold after being auctioned more than twice shall be based on the results up to the sixth auction for the first batch, and the remaining factory names shall be notified in batches successively after being auctioned twice.

### British Prime Minister Concludes Foreign Policy Debate, Sternly Condemns Communism, Vows to Exert Utmost Effort to Eliminate War

The Western European Union Does Not Exclude Participation from Other Parts of the World

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Prime Minister Attlee, in his address during the House of Commons foreign policy debate today, stated that he did not believe war was imminent, but it was still necessary to exert the utmost effort to eliminate the causes of war. Attlee also reiterated the assurance made by Foreign Secretary Bevin in the House of Commons yesterday, that the proposal to establish a European Union does not exclude the possibility of participation from the rest of the world. Amid cheers, Attlee emphasized: [We do not intend to force our free system upon Europe and other parts of the world, and we equally demand that others not force their system upon us.] Attlee then directly addressed Stalin and communism, saying: [Stalin, as a pragmatist, must acknowledge that his proposed communist plan for Britain has completely failed. Britain is willing to establish the friendliest relations with the Soviet Union, and there is no conflict between the two great nations, but the British people are not prepared to accept communism and firmly oppose the communist way of life. Stalin should abandon the notion that Britain will become communist. Britain resolutely opposes the communist concept of unity. Today, in terms of human rights, the Soviet Union is at the very end of the line. The essence of democracy is to allow free discussion of different opinions and to tolerate the opinions of others. Our ideal world is a world with somewhat different opinions, while the communist world wants to make other countries, such as Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, into little Russias. To maintain its position against the communist offensive, Western Europe must achieve unity. However, unity is different from uniformity. If we hold the notion of uniformity, it will hinder our entire goal. Although we hope that other countries can implement democratic socialism, Britain must not interfere. However, I believe that although their doctrines are different, they share a common belief that there must be a balanced economy in the modern world, and therefore it does not hinder their joint cooperation. The [unregulated system of free enterprise capitalism] of the nineteenth century is now dead.] Attlee outlined the Marshall Plan, saying: [Except for those who are prepared to achieve their doctrine through the starvation and death of millions of people, I cannot understand the opposition of others to the Marshall Plan. Britain must have the opportunity to provide great leadership to the Marshall Plan. The meeting of the sixteen European countries may soon be reconvened to adapt its ideas to the recent situation.] Attlee then addressed the proposal for a Western European Union, saying [The establishment of a union of Western European countries and their overseas territories is an unprecedented courageous attempt by mankind. The European Union is completed within the larger framework of the United Nations. Although it is called the European Union, it does not exclude the possibility of participation from other parts of the world.] Attlee also revealed the possibility of establishing a European customs union, which has been reviewed and is now going through its inevitable technical phase in Brussels.

### Establishment of a Western European Anti-Soviet Bloc, US Agrees to Bevin Plan, Believes It Sufficient to Lay the Foundation for Peace

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The State Department issued a formal statement today, agreeing with British Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal to unite Western Europe, stating, [The measures proposed by Bevin can enable the free countries of Western Europe to engage in more urgent unity for common security and welfare. The United States deeply welcomes this proposal. Any proposal that promotes the material and spiritual ties of Western Europe is sufficient to strengthen the joint efforts of the United States and Britain to lay the foundation for peace. It is recognized here that the Bevin Plan is for the establishment of a Western European anti-Soviet bloc. This proposition, as well as Churchill's warning that the international situation is deteriorating, can give greater strength to those who support the Marshall Plan.]

The publication of the Bevin Plan, coming after the State Department's announcement of the Hitler-Molotov Pact, makes the opposing forces of the two worlds more obvious. Many American newspapers used maps to show the position of the "Bevin Group," whose state is no less than the opposing forces of the Allied and enemy countries during wartime. At the same time, talk of war has therefore been revived, and it is even said that Forrestal's announcement of his withdrawal from the presidential race is to prepare to preside over national defense again in an emergency. Diplomatic figures also compared Bevin's speech with British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in March 1939 after the Nazis occupied Prague. Chamberlain's policy of appeasement was abandoned after that speech. Although no one here accuses Bevin of having tried to adopt a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union in the past, Britain's past position was indeed to act as a mediator between the United States and the Soviet Union.

### Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg All Agree

[Reuters, Brussels, 23rd] Belgian Prime Minister Spaak said that Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech yesterday was a milestone in the history of Europe, especially in the history of Asia and Europe. The British and French proposal to extend the Dunkirk Treaty to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg has received sympathy here and is being considered by the responsible authorities. The Netherlands and Luxembourg also welcomed this. The three countries will soon have the opportunity to compare opinions on this matter. I very much agree with Bevin's statement that political agreements must be supplemented by economic agreements. Bevin's words have launched a powerful movement, which, together with the Marshall Plan, can quickly restore the balance of power in Europe.

### Switzerland Decides to Maintain Neutrality

[Reuters, Bern, 23rd] It is recognized here that Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech in the House of Commons yesterday indicates that Britain has finally acknowledged the division of Europe. Swiss officials therefore specifically stated that Switzerland will continue to maintain neutrality. The Swiss economic delegation has departed for Moscow to promote economic ties between the two countries, while at the same time the British and French [Marshall Plan] delegation will come to Switzerland on Tuesday. This shows Switzerland's absolute neutrality. Swiss officials also stated that Switzerland's participation in the Marshall Plan is purely for economic reasons.

### British Foreign Policy Debate Involves Peace Treaty with Japan

[British Information Service, London, 24th] When Foreign Secretary Bevin spoke in the House of Commons on British foreign policy, he specifically mentioned the future peace treaty with Japan. He said that it was very difficult to obtain Soviet agreement on this matter, because the Soviet Union wanted the issue of signing a peace treaty with Japan to be discussed by the Council of Foreign Ministers. Bevin said, [Before the Soviet Union went to war with Japan, if the Soviet Union had then deployed troops along the coastal provinces, it might have had an impact, but the Soviet Union actually only fought Japan for a few days. And what I ask you to agree to is that the countries that fought Japan to the end should occupy a superior position among the Allied countries. What we propose is that a peace treaty conference should be composed of thirteen or fourteen countries.]

[United Press, London, 23rd] When the House of Commons discussed foreign policy today involving the Far East, Labour MP Paget declared that American policy towards Japan should be supported by democratic countries around the world. Conservative MP Dairn said that the British government's cautious attitude has put Britons in Japan in a shameful position and caused Britain to lose the opportunity to participate in the country's future development.

### British, American, and French Conference to Discuss the Merger of West German Occupation Zones, Scheduled to Be Held in London in Mid-March

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Reliable sources say that the conference of the British, American, and French to discuss the West German issue may be held in London between February 17 and 19. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the central issue of the meeting would be to discuss the institutions of West Germany based on the recent resolution of the Frankfurt Conference. France has objections to the Frankfurt resolution, which will naturally be discussed at the meeting. The spokesman also said that if this meeting can produce immediate results, it can give West Germany a good opportunity to overcome the current situation.

### Marshall Abandons Hope of Concluding Austrian Peace Treaty Soon

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Marshall accepted the resignation of Dodge, a former banker at the Detroit Bank who is now an aide negotiating the Austrian peace treaty, on the 24th, so Marshall has already abandoned hope of concluding the Austrian peace treaty soon.

### Soviet Union Asks US to Modify Wartime Lend-Lease Terms and Consider Soviet Union's Wartime Achievements

[United Press, Moscow, 23rd] According to TASS, Washington: The Soviet Union has proposed that the United States "comprehensively consider" the Soviet Army's contribution to the victory in this war and modify the terms for resolving the $20 billion lend-lease bill. According to the Soviet Union, it has submitted a note to the United States on December 16, suggesting the conclusion of an agreement on this matter.

### Hungary and Romania Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty

[Our Newspaper] London, 25th broadcast: Budapest, Hungary and Romania have signed a 20-year treaty of friendship and military mutual assistance, stipulating that joint military action must be taken against any attacker.

### French Government Disregards British Opposition and Resolves to Devalue the Franc

Cripps Arrives in Paris for Talks with Mayer

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The French government decided on the 24th to devalue the franc and establish a free market for gold and certain foreign currencies. A communiqué announced that the cabinet meeting had passed a bill to be submitted to the National Assembly stipulating the rules for the gold and foreign exchange markets. It is not yet known whether France's franc system has been modified to respond to Britain's stance. A French government spokesman only said: British negotiators expressed extreme goodwill and understanding of the situation in France. British and French delegation members kept secret the content of the talks between Cripps and Mayer this morning. Cripps is scheduled to meet with Finance Minister Mayer this afternoon.

### US Business and Industry Groups Unanimously Support Aid to Europe

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] The Executive Committee of the Congress of American Industrial Organizations today reiterated its support for the Marshall Plan to aid Europe and guaranteed that 6 million members would make a frontal attack on the front lines of anti-inflation and wages.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] The National Association of Manufacturers and the Committee for Economic Development today jointly urged that the Marshall Plan to aid Europe be removed from the jurisdiction of the State Department. The two groups and AFL President Green unanimously guaranteed full support for the completion of the goals of the Marshall Plan.

### Eisenhower Firmly Refuses to Run for US President

Vandenberg and Dewey's Calls Grow Louder Again

[United Press, Almuni City, New York, 24th] Marshal Eisenhower firmly stated that he does not intend to run for president. Republican officials in New York believe on the 24th that New York Governor Dewey's election as the Republican candidate is a foregone conclusion. Although Dewey announced through his press secretary that he had "no opinion" on this, Dewey's supporters did not conceal their optimism. Senior government leaders expressed the opinion that Eisenhower's withdrawal may eliminate the threat of Marshal MacArthur being nominated, because Eisenhower's rejection statement also warned soldiers not to get involved in politics.

[United Press, New York, 23rd] Fander, publisher of the Manchester [Union Leader] of New Hampshire, pointed out on the 23rd that although Eisenhower has announced his refusal to run for president, his supporters will continue to nominate candidates on his behalf.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] After Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower issued a statement declining nomination as the Republican presidential candidate, Republican Senator Vandenberg's calls rose again. However, Vandenberg himself had stated that he could not be forced without his consent, but he also said that if the title of presidential candidate was added to him, no one could refuse.

### MacArthur Expresses No Opinion on Eisenhower's Statement

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Marshal MacArthur told the United Press on the 24th that he had "no criticism" of Marshal Eisenhower's announcement rejecting the presidential race. As such, Eisenhower's statement does not seem to have an immediate impact on MacArthur's position. General observers believe that MacArthur is taking a "wait-and-see" stance. However, among the occupation forces who admire MacArthur, they believe that since Eisenhower stated that professional soldiers should not covet the神器 of the presidency, he is actually hindering MacArthur's possible ambitions. MacArthur's name has been included in the Wisconsin presidential primary list, although MacArthur has not yet stated that he is willing to run as a candidate. He has so far insisted that he will remain in Japan until the end of the occupation duties. However, he has never declared that if the Republican Party pushes him as a presidential candidate, he will refuse.

### General Wedemeyer to Be Awarded Permanent Major General Title

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] The US Senate unanimously passed today to award Lieutenant General Wedemeyer the title of permanent major general.

### Britain Asks US to Mediate Dispute Between India and Pakistan

US Government Has Refused

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 23rd] Reliable sources say that the US government has refused Britain's invitation to lead the promotion of the United Nations to resolve the dispute between India and Pakistan. It is said that US officials believe that the United States should not come forward while the Security Council is trying to end the dispute. It is believed that the United States has no close relationship with its foreign policy interests because of the Indian-Pakistani dispute, so it has not taken active action in the Security Council. Britain believes that the Indian-Pakistani incident is more volatile than the Palestinian incident. Unless the United States comes forward to lead the drafting of a plan that can be accepted by both India and Pakistan without either party losing face and power, the Security Council may not be able to resolve the dispute.

[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 24th] The United Nations Security Council's discussion of the dispute between India and Pakistan is nearing the voting stage today. It is learned that the question of sovereignty over Kashmir will be decided by the people of the state.

### US and Britain Plan to Establish a Chain of Air Force Bases in the Mediterranean

[Reuters, London, 23rd] It is reported that British and American representatives have met in London to discuss a tentative plan to establish a chain of British and American air force bases in Cyrenaica, North Africa. The main ones will be in the Benghazi area, and several bases will also be established near Tobruk.

The El Adem airfield in the area during the war still exists today. British troops withdrawing from Palestine may be transferred to Cyprus, Benghazi, and Tripoli. These new bases may be smaller than the air transport base reopened by the United States near Hellaia in Tripoli. The future of any base will depend on the decision of the four-power foreign ministers' representatives on the establishment of a former colony. However, the establishment of a base in Cyrenaica, even if it is temporary, will be of great use for maintaining British and American control in the eastern Mediterranean and the transportation line to the Middle East oil area. Before Britain withdraws from the Holy Land and establishes permanent bases in East Africa, the bases in North Africa will occupy a very important position.

### General Strike of One Million Workers in the State of Bavaria Has Ended, Clay Returns Home to Urge Appropriation of Funds for Grain Transportation

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 24th] The 24-hour strike launched by the Bavarian trade union to protest the lack of food ended at midnight yesterday. Railway and tram night shift workers all reported at midnight. The Bavarian government has promised to take immediate steps to deal with the lack of food. Nearly one million workers throughout Bavaria participated in the general strike. After meeting with the chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions, Hagen, and the Bavarian government, it was decided that the trade union and the farmers' association would draft a food plan as the basis for the government's future actions. In addition, it was decided to ask the Economic Committee of the merged zone in Frankfurt to do its best to promote emergency measures to alleviate the famine. The stability of the Ruhr area is mainly due to the concrete indications that the German administrative authorities and the Allied authorities will soon make efforts to alleviate the famine.

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] General Clay, Commander of the US Forces in Germany, revealed here today that his return to the country was to request Congress to approve the appropriation of $700 million to increase the average food ration in the British and American merged zone in Germany to 1,800 calories per person per day. Clay also believes that although the current labor unrest in the Ruhr will tempt the communist forces to invade the merged zone, it can also stimulate German political leaders to take responsibility for forcing German farmers to sell their grain.

### South Korean Police Chief Assassinated, Assailant Confesses to Being a Communist

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 24th] South Korea has passed through months of peaceful security, but now new terrorist activities have been discovered. This morning, someone threw four grenades at Seoul Police Chief Jang Taek-sang. Jang was only slightly injured and spared, but one of his attendants was seriously injured. One of the three assassins was arrested and two escaped. According to Jang, the arrested assassin has confessed to being a communist. The three assassins were mixed in the crowd who were clearing the snow in front of Jang's residence. They threw four grenades as Jang got into his car. Jang's arm was injured in the blast, and a young assassin was arrested while throwing the fifth grenade.

### General Strike in Northern Italy

Scheduled to End at Midnight on the 24th

[United Press, Rome, 24th] Communist trade unions are apparently following the party's new strategy to strike at the government. They began testing their strength on the 24th by launching a 24-hour general strike. Florence and its surrounding 49 towns have been hit hard. Work stopped at midnight on the 23rd and is scheduled to end at midnight on the 24th. No accidents have occurred so far.

### Hirano Protests to Katayama Regarding Purge

Believes It Was Not a Fair Decision

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Former Agriculture Minister Hirano Rikizo protested to Prime Minister Katayama on the 22nd, saying that according to the certificate submitted to him by Commissioner Okawachi, the decision to purge him was not based on an independent vote, but was carried out by trickery, so the decision was naturally invalid. He also notified Speaker Matsuoka that he would not accept the notice of his purge for the same reason.

### Indonesian Republican Cabinet Resigns En Masse, Hatta Ordered to Form New Cabinet

Indonesians Accuse Former Prime Minister of Succumbing to the Dutch

[United Press, Batavia, 23rd] The Indonesian Republican Cabinet, led by Prime Minister Sjahrir, submitted its resignation en masse today.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th] Indonesian President Sukarno has instructed Vice President Hatta to form a "strong" new cabinet. President Sukarno urged all parties to set aside prejudices and put national interests first.

It is reported that Mr. Hatta is an active supporter of Sali's socialist ideas. His formation of a cabinet this time will be the most welcome figure by all parties in Yogyakarta. However, Mr. Hatta's economic views are generally known to be anti-Chinese.

[United Press, Batavia, 24th] After Indonesian President Hatta was ordered to form a cabinet, he was busy today holding meetings with leaders of various parties. Informed Indonesian sources believe that the number of seats in the new cabinet will be less than that of the previous cabinet, and the number of ministers will not exceed 20. If Hatta's cabinet formation is successful, he will give up the post of vice president, and the new cabinet may be announced on the evening of the 24th.

[United Press, Batavia, 23rd] The resignation of the Indonesian Republican government on the 23rd will apparently cause the ceasefire negotiations between the United Nations in Indonesia and the Netherlands to be shattered in less than a week. Sjahrir's resignation occurred because of fierce attacks by Indonesian nationalists in the past week, accusing the government of succumbing to the Netherlands in the ceasefire agreement.

### Malang's Exiled Overseas Chinese Begin Repatriation

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th] According to reports from the interior of Java, 478 of our exiled refugees originally living in Malang, Dutch East Indies, were evacuated yesterday by the International Red Cross in the post office area, passing through 加多湾, preparing to be repatriated to their original place. These refugees were forced to withdraw to an area 80 kilometers east of Malang when the Dutch took "appeasement actions" to send troops there in July last year.

### Introduction to [The Memoirs of Cordell Hull]

— Translated by our newspaper’s translation department

Our newspaper has decided to publish [The Memoirs of Cordell Hull] in daily installments, starting tomorrow.

This book has not yet been published or released in the United States. The [New York Times] will begin publishing it on the 26th of this month, in forty-two installments. The full text will not be published as a book before those forty-two days. The Editors Press Service, in New York, which is responsible for the publication of [The Memoirs of Cordell Hull], values our newspaper's long history and large readership in China, and has granted our newspaper the exclusive publication rights for Shanghai. The press service also repeatedly communicated back and forth via letters and telegrams regarding the precise date of publication. Initially, they decided that our newspaper should begin publication on the 26th, simultaneously with the [New York Times]. Later, they considered advancing the date to the 24th. Ultimately, they decided on the 26th. The press service was meticulously careful about the publication date, deliberating repeatedly, which demonstrates the importance they place on the manuscript. In fact, the publication date is the same, but Shanghai time is earlier than New York time, so our readers will see this magnificent work earlier than American readers. This is a small contribution of our newspaper, and also a piece of good fortune for our readers.

Cordell Hull was born in Tennessee in 1871. After leaving university in 1891, he practiced law in the state and served as a member of the Tennessee State Legislature. In 1907, he was elected to the House of Representatives, and in 1931, he moved to the Senate. His career in Congress spanned a full twenty-four years. In 1933, the late President Roosevelt invited him to serve as Secretary of State, undertaking the weighty responsibility of American foreign policy. His tenure as Secretary of State lasted for twelve years, longer than that of any other Secretary of State in American history. He retired in 1944 due to overwork and physical weakness. During his twelve years as Secretary of State, it was a period of great international tension. Mussolini was indulging in his dream of restoring the Roman Empire, Hitler was flexing his muscles and annexing neighboring countries in Central Europe, and Japanese imperialists, after seizing our Northeast, were still making constant military advances, inevitably leading to the outbreak of World War II. Fortunately, the Allied nations united to crush the invaders' ambitions and laid the initial foundation for post-war cooperation. As the US Secretary of State, Hull naturally had a thorough understanding of all these inside stories.

[The Memoirs of Cordell Hull] can be said to be the culmination of his political and diplomatic life. The full text is not rigidly divided into sections. For the most part, it narrates the important international events related to American diplomacy in chronological order, while incorporating his personal criticisms and emotions. He provides a subjective account of objective facts, making it lively in both content and style, as if imbuing dull historical facts with a vivid soul. The book contains very detailed accounts of the changes in America's attitude toward the European war, the course of Japanese-American negotiations, and the birth of the United Nations. However, it focuses on his personal activities, making it particularly vivid and showing clear likes and dislikes. As for the descriptions of his personal life, such as his relationship with President Roosevelt, his criticisms of government officials at the time, and his demeanor in dealing with diplomatic figures, they are especially frank, detailed, and engaging. The writing style is simple, but within the plainness there is passion and hidden strength, making it more interesting and more intimate than reading official history.

We feel that there are two points in this book that are most worthy of attention: First, Hull wrote it as a retired Secretary of State, which is quite different from the works written by politicians whose political careers have not yet ended. Ambitious politicians often like to embellish their past actions, sometimes even distorting the facts, but he does not need to. Young politicians, due to various considerations for their future careers or to avoid being misunderstood, cannot fully express what they want to say, but he can. With his past achievements and the age of seventy-five, he can explain the truth clearly and without any reservations. Second, although he was Roosevelt's Secretary of State, he was not merely the president's mouthpiece in the decision-making and implementation of American foreign policy. When he took office as Secretary of State, he told the President, "I do not want merely to convey messages from the President to foreign governments; I want to participate fully in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy." The President did indeed respect his opinions. In fact, his views on international affairs were so close to those of President Roosevelt that they often coincided. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that he was the actual planner and implementer of American foreign policy during the Roosevelt era. The content of the [Memoirs] provides invaluable information about the origins and evolution of American foreign policy during this era.

After reading the full text, we feel that Hull, as a diplomat, has several important characteristics: ① Hull is a diplomat who values international economic relations. During his tenure as a member of Congress, he was a well-known expert in tariffs and domestic tax laws. After taking office as Secretary of State, he regarded international tariff relations—that is, economic relations—as an important part of his foreign policy. He believed that "economic wars are the root cause of political wars, and the elimination of trade discrimination can reduce the possibility of war." In his first speech to Congress at the age of thirty-six, he advocated reducing tariff barriers and trade restrictions, but it was not until he was sixty-two that he finally succeeded in passing the Trade Agreements Act in Congress, after a arduous struggle lasting twenty-six years. However, in the following years, wars broke out in Africa, Asia, and Europe, so some may say, "Look, trade agreements did not prevent war." Hull replied, "Yes, although many trade agreements were signed, war still came. But the United States did not go to war with any country with which we were able to sign a trade agreement. This is a fact. With very few exceptions, all the countries with which we were able to sign trade agreements united to resist the Axis powers. This is also a fact. Political ties are based on economic ties." Who can deny that this insight is a great truth in international relations?

② Hull is a pragmatic diplomat. Throughout his life, he earnestly hoped that lasting peace could benefit the world and mankind, so he earned the nickname "Old Man of Peace," but he was by no means a blind "pacifist." In 1934, as the world situation became increasingly tense, he was the first to advocate strengthening America's self-defense capabilities. At that time, there were many who sang the praises of world peace or advocated that the United States implement a policy of isolation, but Hull recognized two points: First, Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese imperialists were unreasonable. World peace was not unnecessary but impossible. Paying lip service to peace would only enhance the arrogance of the aggressors and relax the self-defense efforts of the democratic countries. Second, the world is one, and peace is indivisible. Implementing a policy of isolation is tantamount to letting other countries fall into the clutches of the aggressors, and one would eventually become a victim of aggression oneself. Understanding this, he did his best to fight against hypocritical pacifists and short-sighted isolationists, advocating a realistic attitude to deal with the realistic international situation. He had a famous saying: "Our people should not be too proud to fight, but in certain conditions, they will not need to be too proud to fight." Nothing is more sincere and earnest than this saying.

③ Hull is an idealistic diplomat. During World War II, he was undoubtedly a warmonger, which was out of practical necessity. In fact, the reason why he advocated fighting the aggressors was to hope that lasting peace would eventually be realized. He, like President Roosevelt, was a great man with ideals and ambitions. He personally experienced two world wars and witnessed the tragedy of two massacres of human beings, deeply feeling that it was not enough to simply win this war; what was more important was to strive for lasting peace. He inherited President Roosevelt's will and added his own creative consciousness, planning a world organization. This is why Hull is called the "Father of the United Nations." He said: "The United Nations is not an alliance against other groups of countries, but an alliance against aggressors, not an alliance for war but an alliance for peace. But we should not expect the United Nations to create miracles. Its meaning is a product of human thought, not perfect. If this organization is to function effectively, it needs time, patience, and a spirit of international cooperation, especially the continued cooperation of the five major powers of the Soviet Union, Britain, China, France, and the United States..." Reading these words, one seems to hear the voice of an elder advising young people, full of enthusiasm and vividly on the page.

The detailed content of [The Memoirs of Cordell Hull] cannot be fully described in a short introduction. Readers must patiently read the original text daily. We will first strive for the faithfulness of the translation, and second, strive for the fluency of the translation style, and hope that readers will criticize and correct us at any time.

### Legislative Elections – Ballot Boxes Opened, Votes Counted: 130,000 Ballots Cast in District Elections; Starting Today, Time Will Be Advanced and Personnel Increased

[Reported by our newspaper] The legislative elections in this city began yesterday with the opening of ballot boxes and counting of votes at the City Council and the City Chamber of Commerce, respectively. The 126 ballot boxes for district elections had been concentrated at the City Council for safekeeping the night before. At 9:25 AM yesterday, Chairman Wu Guozhen arrived at the scene, followed by Zhang Xiaosong, Chen Baotai, and others. At 9:30 AM, the Mayor took the stage to announce the start of the vote count. The Director of the Vote Counting Center, Chen Minshu, then reported on the vote counting procedures and the criteria for invalid ballots. He stated: "To ensure impartiality, the Election Office has notified each candidate to send representatives to stay overnight at the venue to supervise the process. During the daytime vote counting, they are allowed to monitor from outside the venue, while only vote counting personnel and news reporters are allowed free access inside." The Mayor then left the scene, and the vote counting work commenced.

Yesterday's vote counting concluded at 6:30 PM. A total of 14 ballot boxes were opened, including two from the Tilanqiao District, two from the Zhenru District, one from the Wusong District, four from the Jing'an District, three from the Putuo District, one from the Luwan District, and one from the North Railway Station District. More than 130,000 ballots were counted. More than 60 staff members were divided into nine groups to carry out the work. The candidates who sent representatives to stay overnight to supervise were Xie Renzhao, Zheng Yuxiu, and Ma Junshuo. Xie Renjian had sent a representative to stay overnight the night before, while the representatives of the latter two arrived yesterday. The vote count and ranking of each candidate yesterday are as follows:

Wang Xinheng: 25,111 votes

Zheng Yuxiu: 18,875 votes

Ma Junshuo: 18,458 votes

Cao Jun: 17,717 votes

Fang Zhichao: 14,181 votes

Yan Huiqing: 14,001 votes

Ma Shuli: 6,146 votes

Wang Jian'e: 5,814 votes

Xie Renzhao: 4,789 votes

Qian Jianqiu: 3,175 votes

Xia Sungui: 457 votes

Lu Mei: 434 votes

Zhu Wende: 84 votes

Zhou Yizhi: 65 votes

Zhao Zhimei: 59 votes

Ji Qiao: 32 votes

### Over a Thousand Invalid Ballots; Some Voted for Huang Chao

Yesterday, there were a total of 1,184 invalid ballots, most of which had circles drawn between the names of two candidates, making them difficult to identify. Others had circles drawn below the names of candidates, making it impossible to distinguish the voter's intention. In addition, in the third polling station of the Wusong District, two ballots nominated "Huang Chao" and included a ditty explaining the reasons for choosing Huang Chao, stating that Huang Chao was brave and could kill all the bad guys. In the ballot boxes of the Tilanqiao District, there was also a letter full of complaints, arguing that elections were meaningless and suggesting that the election campaign funds should be donated to winter relief efforts.

### Ji Qiao Declares Abandonment, But Did Not Complete Procedures with Election Headquarters

Because the vote counting started late yesterday, the number of ballots counted was relatively small. Starting today, the vote counting will start earlier at 9:00 AM, and efforts will be made to increase manpower. Regarding the declaration of abandonment by Ji Qiao, the candidate from the Democratic Socialist Party, before the election, Director Zhang Xiaosong stated that Ji only published an advertisement in the newspaper and did not complete the procedures with the Election Headquarters. The City Election Office has not received any instructions from the headquarters. Therefore, legally, he should be treated the same as other candidates. Fortunately, after a candidate is elected, whether formally or as an alternate, the election office must formally inquire whether they are willing to be elected, at which time they can express their opinion.

### Senior Ship Officers' Elections – No Resolution Yet

After the Nanjing Vocational Women's Election Office ordered that master mariners, marine engineers, radio operators, pilots, and other technicians who are senior ship officers be handled separately, a dispute arose over the return of ship officers' certificates to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau. After repeated persuasion by the bureau, the heads of the senior ship officers' groups tentatively collected more than 1,000 certificates for safekeeping. It is learned that the Maritime Affairs Bureau telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation yesterday to report and request instructions. However, today many ship officers went to the bureau to return their certificates, and senior ship officers from various ships arriving in port today are asking their respective senior ship officers' groups to make the most effective protest to the Election Office.

### KMT Party Members and Cadres – Registration Extended by Three Days

Since the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang (KMT) began re-registering party members and cadres, approximately 70,000 people have applied for registration. The original deadline was the 25th of this month. According to the personnel in charge of registration at the party headquarters, in order to avoid excluding a few party members and cadres, it has been decided to extend the deadline by three days, until the 28th of this month, at which time there will be no further extension.

### Professional Association Ballot Boxes – Industry, Commerce, Agriculture, and Education Opened First; Ballots Marked Below Names Unanimously Determined Valid

[Reported by our newspaper] The vote counting for the legislative elections of professional associations began at 10:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce. Forty vote counting personnel, divided into five groups, were presided over by Director Chen Boliang. Fifteen supervisors appointed by the Election Office, including Wang Xianqing, were present to perform their supervisory duties. Mayor Wu arrived promptly after completing the opening ceremony at the City Council. A simple ceremony was held first, during which Chen Boliang read out the vote counting procedures and the standards for determining invalid ballots: ① Ballots not issued by the polling station; ② Ballots without any markings; ③ Ballots with markings for two or more candidates; ④ Ballots with markings not above the surname; ⑤ Ballots with other words written on them; ⑥ Ballots with markings that have been altered. Mayor Wu then raised the fourth standard, stating: The vote counting center for district elections believes that many ballots have names circled, or circled below the name. Because it does not conform to the regulation, if those are all deemed invalid, it seems that the voters' intention is being erased. They have unanimously decided that ballots such as those should also be deemed valid. The Mayor specifically raised this point to solicit the opinions of everyone. After it was approved, it will be handled the same as in the district vote. Mayor Wu then used a key to open the second ballot box of the labor union. After the ceremony was completed, the vote counting was declared to have begun. Of the 47 ballot boxes, the labor union, commerce association, farmers' association, and education association were opened first. Among them, the two ballot boxes of the education association have been fully opened and tallied, while only five of the labor union's nineteen ballot boxes have been opened, only two of the farmers' association's four ballot boxes have been opened, and only three of the commerce association's six ballot boxes have been opened. In addition to continuing to open the above incomplete ballot boxes today, the professional associations will also begin to open their ballot boxes.

### Education Association – Tradition First

The number of votes obtained by each association candidate yesterday are recorded below:

Education Association: Tradition First, 55,341 votes; Cao Chu, 11,851 votes; Ye Suchong, 4,957 votes; Ye Hua (female), 3,011 votes; Wu Zonghan, 2,750 votes. 14 invalid ballots.

Labor Union: Lu Jingshi, 135,221 votes; Ling Yingzhen, 298 votes; Wang Yisheng, 8 votes; Sun Jingui, 9 votes; Sun Xiangfeng, 2 votes. 116 invalid ballots.

Commerce Association: Luo Qinghua, 65,385 votes; Pan Shihao, 25,420 votes; Chen Dayu, 2,001 votes; Lü Cang, 1,546 votes; Zhu Huiqing, 1,504 votes. 37 invalid ballots.

Farmers’ Association: Li Qing, 10,191 votes; Zhang Jingqing, 4,390 votes; Chen Shilian, 87 votes; Sun Jixu, 8 votes; Wu Wangji, 1 vote; Ban Xiyu, 1 vote. 453 invalid ballots.

### Dance Industry Holds Symposium, Decides to Send Representatives Again to Request Postponement

[Reported by our newspaper] The Dance Hall Association held a symposium at its premises at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss their own problems after the dance ban. More than 50 people attended the symposium, including representatives from the Dance Hall Association, the Dance Industry Workers' Union, the Dancers' Association, the Musicians' Association, and the Women's Association. It was decided: ① To hold a charity sale in dance halls and nightclubs throughout the city on the 28th of this month, with the proceeds used as a welfare fund for dance hall industry colleagues. ② To convene a conference at New Sennin on the 31st of this month to discuss requesting the authorities to extend the deadline by drawing lots, and representatives from the City Council and other circles will be invited to attend. ③ To nominate Sun Hongyuan, Tang Zongjie, and five others as representatives to petition in Beijing again on a regular basis, demanding the withdrawal of the order.

### Conscription Conference Postponed Due to Director Xu's Absence

[Reported by our newspaper] The city's conscription conference, originally scheduled for today, has been postponed to the 30th of this month because Xu Siping, Director of the Conscription Department of the Ministry of National Defense, has not yet arrived in Shanghai. Yao Wenyin, Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau, said: "Director Xu is currently inspecting conscription in Hunan and Hubei. If Xu is unable to come to Shanghai by then, it will have to be postponed to the beginning of next month. The method of conscription, the date of conscription, and the method of fundraising in the city this year must all be discussed and decided after Xu arrives in Shanghai."

### End-of-Year Bonus for Clothing Industry Workers – Principles to be Decided Through Consultation

[Reported by our newspaper] The request for end-of-year bonuses from vocational workers in the Western clothing, leather shoe, and fashion industries was transferred to the Labor-Management Arbitration Council by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The small group of the Arbitration Council discussed it yesterday. Because the capital side believed there was no precedent, and the labor side insisted on the bonus payment, to avoid the expansion of disputes, it was decided that the General Labor Union and the Chamber of Commerce would separately persuade both labor and capital sides. The capital side would give the workers a sum of money under another name, and it would not be called the end-of-year bonus. The principle is still pending approval by Director Wu and needs to be further discussed in detail.

### Intention to Frame People – Two Foremen Indicted

[Reported by our newspaper] Huang Bosen and Lu Chunchi, foremen at the Xinzha Bridge West Rice Wharf, were prosecuted by the District Procuratorate yesterday for false accusation. According to the indictment, the workers Shen Baoshan, Chen Ruhong, Sun Lianchi, Cheng Xilai, Zhang Chenghong, and others contacted workers to hold a meeting, intending to audit Huang Bosen's accounts. Huang, in order to preempt them, colluded with Lu Chunchi as a witness to falsely accuse Shen and the other four of being suspected of being members of a different party and secretly reported them to a certain unit of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense stationed in Shanghai. The unit issued an order to the Shanghai Police Department to investigate. On December 24 last year, Huang and Lu, together with police officers, secretly brought a large number of reactionary slogans and leaflets that had been prepared in advance and placed them in the residences of Shen and others, using this as an excuse to arrest Shen and the other four. After investigation, the police bureau found that Huang and Lu were suspected of false accusation and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 28 and Article 169, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law.

### Flying Trade Show – Displaying Tire and Parts Samples on a Plane – Flying to the Far East for Exhibition

[Reported by our newspaper] An "Atlas Flying Trade Show" will arrive at the city's Longhua Airport on the 27th of this month. The trade show is set up on a Douglas DC4 aircraft and is a new American invention used for advertising. The plane displays samples of the latest tires, automobile parts, and aircraft parts produced by the "Atlas Company" for exhibition throughout the Far East to promote them. After arriving in Shanghai, it will host visits from all walks of life, and the person in charge of the company and the cooperative Mobil Oil Company will jointly host the reception and explanations. It is planned to stay in Shanghai for five days, fly to Beijing on March 1 and stay for one day, and then go to Peiping and stay for two days. A total of sixteen people are traveling on the same plane, including Bedford, president of the Atlas Company and director of Mobil Oil Company, Vice President Padeheimer, and seven other department heads and managers, three Mobil Oil Company representatives, and six pilots, radio operators, and mechanics.

### Corruption Case of Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) Staff - First Trial of Eight Defendants - Hou Aichang Testifies on Reasons for Stopping Fan Distribution - Claimed They Were Intended for Use by CNRRA's Health Department

[Our Newspaper] In the corruption case of senior CNRRA officials, Hou Aichang and twelve others were previously indicted by the District Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the District Court's Criminal Division held its first public trial, presided over by Judge Huang Guang in Criminal Court One. The defendants present were Hou Aichang, Director of the CNRRA Office and General Manager of the Finance Department's Materials Purchasing and Sales Office; Dong Chengdao, Director of the Finance Department; Hu Keshi, former Director of the General Affairs Department and Director of Fisheries Management; Tao Jingyuan, Chief of the Finance Department's Document Section; Jiang Renlin, former Chief of the General Affairs Department's Welfare Section; Pang Yuanlong; Deputy Chief Auditor Du Cen; and Deng Zhonghe, General Manager of Anle Textile Factory. Wu Zhiwei, Hou Aichang's brother-in-law, was present, and many family members of the defendants were in court to observe. After roll call, the court announced individual questioning.

Changing Yarn Standards Due to Storage Difficulties

Hou Aichang testified first: The electric fans allocated to CNRRA by UNRRA were unsuitable for relief purposes, so they were publicly auctioned. Zheng Yi Trading Company won the bid for some at 356,000 yuan per fan. Subsequent auctions failed to attract any bids, so they were sold publicly in the retail department. He could not remember how many were sold through the retail department. The reason for stopping sales in June was to inventory the stock. At that time, over 500 official letters requesting fan allocation were received from various agencies. Because he intended to reserve 2,000 fans for use by CNRRA's Health Department, he issued a hand-written instruction to the Document Section to ignore all requests to avoid trouble. He also couldn't remember how many fans were left when sales stopped. As for the original standard for exchanging American cotton for yarn, it was 670 pounds of American cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn. However, CNRRA exchanged 760 pounds of American cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn. Although Mr. Kahn, Director of the Cotton Yarn Department of UNRRA's China Office, initially objected at a meeting, he raised no further objections after explanation. This was because cotton storage was separate from insurance, not an excuse.

Yuyuan Road House - Not a Gift

The companies allocated cotton yarn were selected from a list of over 20 provided by the Import and Export Management Committee. Contracts were based on this list. Anle Textile Factory received a disproportionately large allocation of wool, but no kickbacks were received. The house at 396 Yuyuan Road was not a gift from Deng Zhonghe. Wu Zhiwei rented the house from Deng and sublet it to me for a fixed term of two years at a rent of US$720, paid in advance. Wu's letter to Deng proves this.

Dong Chengdao was then questioned and testified: The allocation of electric fans was not within my area of responsibility, and I am unclear about the situation. I also do not know whether Deng Zhonghe gave Hou Aichang a house.

Document Section Chief Tao Jingyuan testified: The allocation of electric fans was done under orders. The reason for not responding to requests from various agencies was due to Director-General Hou's instructions to reject all applications.

Exclusive Allocation - Reasons for Wool

Deng Zhonghe testified: The house on Yuyuan Road was rented to Wu Zhiwei, who then sublet it to Hou. Wu's letter proves this. As for why my factory received a disproportionately large allocation of wool, many factories were unwilling to purchase it at the time, and others often issued bad checks. However, my factory purchased large quantities and never bounced a check. Jiang Renlin testified: During my tenure as Chief of the Welfare Section, I used 5 million yuan from the contingency fund, but this was for the renovation of the CNRRA Ruifeng Lane dormitory and was used for public purposes, not for personal embezzlement. All expenditures were supported by invoices, but there was no public bidding, so the procedures were slightly deficient.

Du Cen testified: The Deputy Chief Auditor reviews all accounts on behalf of the Chief Auditor. The purchase of furniture from Jin Changxiang and Hua Chang Company by Specialist Chen Timin was not reviewed in advance, and the procedures were indeed incomplete. However, this was approved by a certain auditor, and I only learned about it later.

Furniture Purchase - Flawed Procedures

Hu Keshi testified: The purchase of furniture was not audited in advance, which was slightly flawed, but because the furniture was purchased in small quantities, it was finally submitted to the audit office for review in aggregate. This was a practical difficulty.

Pang Yuanlong testified: The refrigerator in the Ruifeng Lane dormitory was purchased by my father, but I cannot provide proof.

Witness Wu Zhiwei stated: I rented the house on Yuyuan Road from Deng and sublet it to Hou. I gave Deng a letter informing him of the details.

The questioning ended after 6:00 PM. The court ordered Du Cen and Jiang Renlin to each provide two shop guarantors. The remaining defendants were released on their original bail, and the trial was adjourned to a later date.

### Six Engineering Societies Hold Joint Social Gathering - Opera Performances by Amateur Singers Add to the Merriment

[Our Newspaper] Last night, the Shanghai branches of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers, the Chinese Society of Automotive Engineers, the Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society, the Chinese Municipal Engineering Society, the Chinese Society of Power Engineers, and the Chinese Institute of Engineers held a joint social gathering in the grand hall on the third floor of the Yiyuan Hotel on Fuxing West Road. The entertainment program began around 7:00 PM and included alternating social dances, piano solos, and soprano solos. There were also Peking opera performances by amateur singers, including Ms. Jiang Jiaohongying's "Phoenix Returns to Its Nest," Wang Zhunchen's "Dingjun Mountain," Ms. Wang Huiheng's "Spring Boudoir Dream," and Wei Shanghou's "Catching and Releasing Suqin." Famous amateur opera singers Ni Qiuping and Wang Ruoqi played the strings. The gathering concluded in high spirits around 11:00 PM.

### Joint Association of Factories Relocated to Sichuan and Guangxi Demands Allocation of Reparations Materials - Decides to Add Representatives to Petition the Authorities

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai office of the Joint Association of Factories Relocated to Sichuan and Guangxi and the former China Central and Southern Region Industrial Association held their third temporary joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Representatives from the Restoration Committee of Privately-Owned Yarn Factories Relocated to the Rear Areas also attended. More than 100 people were present, chaired by Hu Juewen, to discuss a unified opinion on the handling of Japanese reparations materials for factories relocated during the war, in order to continue to argue with the government based on reason.

The chairman first reported on the progress of handling the case, followed by a discussion of the reparations issue. The representatives spoke enthusiastically, and the consensus was that the government should allocate a portion of the Japanese reparations materials for privately-owned factories that suffered losses due to relocation during the war, as a form of compensation without requiring payment. However, they would not give up the right to apply for allocation at a price but would request preferential treatment. The preferential conditions included requesting exemption from pricing in US dollars and extending the installment payment period to five years. It was also decided that in addition to the original 19 representatives including Hu Juewen, 12 more representatives would be added: Li Zushen, Ding Ximeng, Zhu Xianfang, Xie Tiansha, Xia Shuyu, Wan Fa, He Fangliang, Chen Tianhe, Zeng Haoshan, Xiao Boshiu, Xiang Yitao, and Liu Zhensheng. They would be responsible for continuing to petition the government. A delegation would be formed to petition the relevant authorities in both Nanjing and Shanghai, write to the Chairman, and send telegrams to various regions to seek sympathy from all sectors of society. Regarding the government's announced "Revised Measures for Priority Leasing and Purchase of Enemy and Puppet Factories by Factories Restoring Operations in the Rear Areas," the conference decided to continue participating in leasing and purchasing, but to strive for improvements in certain unreasonable regulations. The meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM.

### "Da Zhonghua" Ship Encounters Danger - Strong Winds and Heavy Snow - Runs Aground in Qingdao

[Our Newspaper] Recently, strong northeasterly winds and heavy snowfall have made navigation difficult, causing serious impact on ships. The coastal radio station received a distress telegram from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Da Zhonghua" ship around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, stating that it had "run aground on M蹄礁 (Ma Ti Jiao) near Qingdao, the engine room is flooded, urgently awaiting rescue."

It is reported that the ship weighs 4,900 tons and had recently transported coal from Qinhuangdao to Qingdao. It was preparing to load cargo in Qingdao to transport to Shanghai when it was blown onto the reef by a storm while berthed in the port. Due to the severe wind and snow at sea, rescue ships were unable to approach.

[Another Report] China Merchants Bureau's "Jiang Ya" liner on the Shanghai-Ningbo route is delayed in Ningbo due to the storm and will return to Shanghai when the weather improves. Furthermore, a steel barge owned by Xingzhong Company, towed by the "Xingmin" tugboat, sailed from Shanghai to Hankou on the morning of the 22nd of this month. Near Baimao, the river was hit by torrential winds and waves, causing it to lose control. The "Xingmin" tugboat ran aground and the hull flooded, while the steel barge drifted with the current. After the tugboat sent out a distress signal, the China Merchants Bureau's "Hai Wan" ship, en route from Wuhu, happened to pass by and received the distress signal. It approached the smaller ship and rescued all six crew members, bringing them to Shanghai yesterday. Xingzhong Company received the report and requested that China Merchants Bureau dispatch a ship for rescue. The Bureau's Maritime Affairs Department has assigned "Min 313" to sail to the scene of the accident near Baimao this morning to attempt towing and search for the steel barge.

### Treasonous Jewelry - Invaluable

[Our Newspaper] Among the properties confiscated by the authorities from major and minor traitors after the victory, there is a category of precious jewelry, including diamonds, jadeite, jade bracelets, watches, brooches, gold ingots, gold Longevity Stars, gold Magu, etc., totaling 2,772 pieces, with a wide variety of items, a magnificent sight. Among them, the largest diamond weighs 30 carats. It is said to belong to the Qianye Family. The decorations seized from the home of the traitor Youjia are the most numerous. The value of these valuables is very high. According to the initial estimate by the Military Intelligence Bureau, which received them, they are worth over 9,600 taels of gold.

All of these jewelry items are currently stored in safe deposit boxes at the Bank of China. The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office is having a big headache dealing with their disposal. If an auction is adopted, people must be allowed to view the samples. However, the jewelry is small in size but of great value. If there is any negligence and theft or substitution occurs, no one on the staff dares to take responsibility. Therefore, the office recently plans to use the method of entrusting the Central Savings Society to issue lottery tickets. The principle is already being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, since the types and values of the jewelry vary, even if this method is implemented in the future, there may still be some twists and turns. Since the news of issuing lottery tickets spread, many outsiders have become interested in this matter. Some people from other cities have even remitted money in advance to make reservations, which is quite difficult for the person in charge of the office to handle.

Largest Diamond Weighs 30 Carats - Planned to be Auctioned by Issuing Lottery Tickets

### A Major Bloody Incident Caused by Professional Jealousy - Glass Merchant Intentionally Retaliates - Two Guns Fired, Three Injured

Coffin Purchased in Advance and Grave Prepared

[Our Newspaper] Chen Chunsheng, also known as Chen Mapi, 30 years old, from Nanjing, who runs Tai Glass Company at 47 Lane 8, Fujian Middle Road, has been making a profit in his business due to his smooth dealings. Unexpectedly, in February last year, Cheng Quanlin, 34 years old, from Changzhou, suddenly established Taichangxiang Glass Company at 2 Lane, which led to a decline in Chen's business. Chen held a grudge and once led a group to Cheng's company, attempting to destroy it, which resulted in punishment and compensation.

Chen's resentment deepened. Yesterday morning at approximately 8:15 AM, Chen, dressed in a Zhongshan suit and carrying a handgun, went to Cheng's residence and knocked on the door. Cheng's relative, Cheng Houdi, opened the door and asked for his intention. Chen falsely claimed to be repaying a debt and went straight to the second floor, barging into the parlor. At this time, Cheng Quanlin had already heard footsteps and opened the door, inviting him in and asking where he came from. Chen immediately replied that he was from Hongkou. Shortly after, two gunshots rang out in the room. One bullet hit Cheng's left waist, and he fell to the ground. Cheng's wife, Wang Heying (from Changzhou), was full-term pregnant at the time and was sitting on the edge of the bed, dressing her three-year-old daughter, Pei Di. Chen fired another shot, hitting the girl's left arm and piercing her mother's abdomen. Both mother and daughter were injured and immediately fell to the ground. Although Cheng was shot, he remained conscious and struggled to get up, intending to pursue the assailant. At the same time, his cousin, Yin Hegui, who lived in the attic, heard two gunshots and saw someone holding a gun, running onto the balcony. She shouted loudly and ran to the parlor to check, where she saw Cheng Quanlin and others lying in pools of blood. She immediately turned around and went downstairs. At this time, Chen had already jumped down, breaking his head and crouching on the ground. Fortunately, Police Chief Zhu Desheng of Precinct 1186 nearby, along with police officer No. 3273, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and arrested Chen. They also summoned ambulances to send the injured to Renji, Gongji, and Police Hospitals for treatment. Afterwards, Lao Zha Police Bureau Chief Shi ordered Section Chief Jiang to supervise officers Tang Zhihao, Chen Jun'gan, Li Junkun, and Xia Yongzhi to rush to investigate. They seized an automatic pistol and several bullets and found a receipt in Chen's company showing that he had purchased a coffin worth 20 million yuan from the Anshoucai Section of the Pingjiang Public Office in November. He had also purchased a burial plot from the Buddhist First Cemetery, drawn his own plans, made porcelain portraits, and written "The Tomb of Mr. Chen Chunsheng" on yellow paper, along with charcoal ash, lime, and porterage fees. It is clear that he had planned to kill Cheng for a long time. It is reported that the gun he used was purchased from a person named Shi from Fang. Officers were dispatched to Shi's residence, but he had already left for Changsha. Cheng's wife, Wang Heying, was sent to Renji Hospital for surgery. After removing 10 bullets, her condition remained critical until midnight.

### Committee for Review of Occupied Civilian Land Established - First Meeting Yesterday - Approved Review Guidelines and Divided Proposals for Review

[Our Newspaper] The founding meeting and first meeting of the Executive Yuan's Central Agencies Using Enemy-Occupied Civilian Land Review Committee in Shanghai was held at the City Hall conference room yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Those in attendance included Chairman Wu Guozhen, Deputy Chairman Zhu Ping, Shen Zonglian and Zhang Shi from the City Government, Zhang Shuzeng from the Ministry of National Defense, Dan Yinsun from the Ministry of Education, Ouyang Lun from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ma Lianfang from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Xia Xianjiang from the Resources Commission, Ge Jieshen from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Ma Shaoquan, Chen Shukun, Xu Xiajun, and Sun Yujun from the Shanghai Real Estate Association, Xie Haoling from Zhongju Xin, and Xiang Changquan from the Shanghai City Council, totaling 30 people. Mayor Wu, representing the Executive Yuan, delivered a speech stating that the central agencies using enemy-occupied civilian land in Shanghai has been a long-standing issue without a thorough solution, which is of great concern. Therefore, this review committee was specifically established to accelerate the clearing within a limited period of three months. If requisition is necessary, it will be requisitioned at a discounted price; otherwise, it will be returned immediately.

Deputy Chairman Zhu Ping then reported that during the period of enemy occupation, the Enemy Property Company originally planned to earmark and requisition civilian land, and enemy and puppet military agencies forcibly occupied civilian land, totaling approximately 100,400 mu. Among them, 7,200 mu had been issued land prices. After the recovery, it was handled by the Enemy and Puppet Property Office. The central government attaches great importance to this matter and has specifically established this committee, instructing the local government to clear it within a limited time. During this period, the Land Administration Bureau sent personnel to investigate and collect data. According to the investigation, the civilian land received and used by various agencies is approximately 59,000 mu. A total of 2,035 cases of people applying for the return of land have been received and urgently need to be reviewed.

Three Groups to Review Separately

The meeting then discussed and approved the amendment to the Enemy and Puppet Land Use Regulations and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for filing. The proposals were divided into three groups for review to expedite the process. The first group will review cases involving the use of civilian land for military and transportation projects. The list is as follows: Ma Shaoquan (Convener), Zhang Shuhui, Xie Haoling, Zhang Shi, Zhang Xuelian, Xu Xiajun, plus one representative from the Ministry of Communications and one representative from the Lawyers Association. The second group will review cases involving the use of civilian land for educational, academic, cultural, and charitable projects. The list is as follows: Ge Jieshen (Convener), Chen Shukun, Dan Yinsun, Ma Lianfang, Wang Weiyuan, Sun Yujun, plus one representative from the Lawyers Association. The third group will review cases involving the use of civilian land for state-owned enterprises. The list is as follows: Xiang Changquan (Convener), Ouyang Lun, Ma Lianfang, Xia Xianjiang, Shen Naizheng, Yang Shukang, plus one representative from the Lawyers Association.

Two Temporary Motions

Subsequently, two temporary motions were passed: The standard for paying for land forcibly requisitioned by the enemy and puppets should be formulated in accordance with the actual situation, and Zhu Ping (Convener), Xie Haoling, and Ma Shaoquan were nominated as members to be responsible for drafting and submitting it to the next general meeting for discussion. It was resolved that all central agencies in Shanghai using enemy-occupied civilian land should submit a clear list and use plan within one month for review. If the deadline is exceeded, it will be regarded as unnecessary to use and will be returned immediately.

### Protecting Child Labor and Apprentices - Deciding to First Investigate Treatment Conditions - To Serve as the Basis for Formulating General Rules

[Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau previously drafted general rules for apprentice service to improve the treatment of child labor and submitted them to the City Government for approval. The City Government forwarded it to the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee for review. The Adjudication Committee convened a small group meeting yesterday morning to discuss it. Those in attendance included Zhang Yongqin, Tian Heqing, Liang Yongzhang, Liu Jingji, Fan Zhenbang, and Zhou Xuexiang. It was decided that before formulating these general rules, the Social Affairs Bureau should, together with various agencies, conduct a practical investigation of the treatment and learning conditions of apprentices and child laborers in general factories and shops, to serve as a basis for reference during formulation. To curb the abuse of child labor and unreasonable treatment, the small group decided that the competent authorities should issue an order to various industry associations, instructing their member factories, companies, and shops to pay attention to several points: Apprentices must have eight hours of sleep and adequate rest time. Monthly wages shall not be less than three yuan, calculated according to the cost-of-living index. After the three-year apprenticeship period expires, the learning period shall not be extended on any pretext. The above points will be submitted to the City Government after approval by the general meeting.

### Theft of Calligraphy and Painting Dispute at Former Vice President Tan's Residence in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] At the residence of former Vice President Tan at 1 Lane 11, Tai'an Road, several valuable calligraphy and paintings and two seals used by Tan during his lifetime were recently stolen. After Tan's eldest daughter, Tan Rui, discovered this, she believed that Wei Zhongbao, the son of the male servant Wei Shurong, was highly suspected and pursued him. However, she was insulted by Wei, so she reported to the Detective Section of the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation. Section Chief Chen Xianrong sent officers to investigate and found two of Tan's seals, five scrolls of calligraphy and painting, three pieces of clothing, one blue and one white piece of silk, and one mat in Wei's residence at 219 Fuxing West Road. Tan's daughter identified them as correct, so Wei's son was brought to the bureau. However, Wei's father claimed that the above-mentioned relics were actually gifts given to him by Tan during his lifetime and have been collected for many years, so there was no theft. After hearing the statement, the police bureau released him on bail after slightly reprimanding his son for insulting the master.

### The Shen Gongwei Scandal: His Wife Unwilling to Withdraw the Lawsuit; Li Zhen Testifies About How They Met

[Our Report] Li Zhen, a red-hot dancing girl known as "Yang Nannan," is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office for her entanglement in a romantic scandal with Shen Gongwei. Previously, Prosecutor Li had her released on bail of 2,000 yuan in cash, while Shen was detained. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, District Prosecutor Fang Zheng summoned Shen's wife, Mao Xiuzhen, and Li Zhen for questioning. Mao arrived wearing a yellow floral fur coat, a blue scarf, and black high-heeled leather shoes. The prosecutor first questioned Mao Xiuzhen, who stated, "I am 24 years old, from Hubei. I married Shen in 1945 and now have two children, a son and a daughter. Shen usually doesn't have a proper job and spends his time wandering around. Our relationship was good after we married, but it gradually deteriorated after he met Li Zhen. Shen usually got money from me, but later he took many of my jewelry pieces to spend. On the night of the 19th, Shen came home and threatened me with a handgun, saying he would kill me. I left to avoid his violence. When I returned home on the 20th, the maid told me that the young master was at home, sleeping with a dancing girl in the bedroom. I reported this to the police station, and the officers knocked on the door. Shen only opened it after fifteen minutes. The handgun was on the table. I helped Li put on her underwear and had both of them arrested by the police. Now I want to sue Shen and Li for adultery and am unwilling to withdraw the lawsuit." Li Zhen testified, "I am 23 years old and work as a dancing girl. I first met Shen in 1946 at the New Xianlin Dance Hall, introduced by Miss Mao's younger brother. We became intimate five months later. Shen and I did not live together; the house is my own. Shen usually just eats at my house, and sometimes we go out together, with me paying for everything. The rumor that I am supporting Shen is not true. On the night of the 19th, Shen got me drunk and took me to his house. Shen took off my coat, but not my underwear. Shen once told me that Miss Mao was like a sister to him and that he would marry me in the future. People from Shen's family often came to my house to hang out." At this point, the court noted that because the plaintiff, Mao Xiuzhen, was unwilling to withdraw the lawsuit, the case still required further investigation and adjourned it to a later date. Both Mao and Li were dismissed. Shen Gongwei was not interrogated yesterday.

### Developing the Shengsi Islands: Director Dong Zanyao Talks to Our Reporter About the New and Old Fishing Industries

[Our Report from Zhenjiang, 23rd] The Shengsi Islands are not only the only fishing area in Jiangsu Province but also one of the four major fishing grounds in the country. Located on the front line of national defense in the East China Sea, they are also important militarily. Before the war, the amount of fish caught each year was worth more than 20 million yuan. With the application of new fishing methods, the yield would be even more considerable. The islands originally belonged to the fifth district of Chongming. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, recognizing the importance of the area, specially established a new governing bureau this morning to actively develop the islands. It also organized the Shengsi Construction Committee to actively promote development. Last week, Director Dong Zanxiao of the Construction Department, along with Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, jointly inspected the islands, spending half a month there before returning to the province yesterday. Director Dong told our reporter that the islands have a population of about 24,000 people during normal times, which increases to more than 100,000 during the fishing season. There are currently more than 3,800 fishing boats and dozens of fishing vessels, which were previously controlled by unscrupulous fishing bosses. Since the provincial government ordered their arrest, these bosses have disappeared. However, last year suffered an unprecedented typhoon, and the production of hairtail during the spring season alone dropped sharply from 300,000 catties to 50,000 catties, resulting in severe losses that greatly impacted the lives of fishermen. The following projects are currently under active development:

Salt Problem: An agreement has been reached with the Salt Bureau to establish two salt warehouses on the islands, with a regular salt storage capacity of 4,000 dan.

Fishing Loan Problem: Most fishermen on the islands have no savings and are exploited by high-interest loans, leading to extreme economic hardship. This is a major obstacle to the revival of the fishing industry. A survey of fishing capital is underway, and the China Farmers Bank is being asked to provide low-interest fishing loans.

Food Supply Problem: The islands are a fishing area and do not produce rice. There is a constant shortage of food. Efforts are being made to apply for and transport rice permits to facilitate the purchase and transport of rice.

Transportation Problem: The islands are isolated overseas, making transportation inconvenient. For example, mail must be sent via Daishan, Zhejiang, taking more than ten days to arrive. In the future, it is planned to allocate transportation vessels to facilitate transportation.

Fishing Port Problem: The construction of Shengshan Fishing Port is extremely urgent. Although the terrain is relatively good, there is often a risk of not being able to take shelter in time when there are changes in weather conditions. Moreover, during the fishing season, fishing boats from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces gather there. If a fishing port could be built there, natural disasters could be avoided. However, the project is large and cannot be completed in a short time. The first step is to detonate the three reefs in the main waterway to reduce the danger.

Drinking Water Problem: This is, of course, a major problem for the islanders. It is planned to build more reservoirs wherever possible and to find ways to dig wells to solve the residents' drinking water problem.

Afforestation Problem: There are very few trees on the islands, and the mountains are barren. A campaign to promote afforestation is underway to make the barren islands green. Other initiatives, such as promoting fishing village side industries like weaving nets and shipbuilding, are also included in the development plan. In the future, there will be more urgent problems to solve, such as the

Fishing Boat Improvement Problem: In the process of transitioning from old-style fishing boats to new-style fishing vessels, what kind of fishing boat should be built that is the most practical, popular, and productive tool for fishermen? This is a big problem that must be studied. Currently, fishermen can only fish inshore because their boats are too small. They cannot cook on the boats and must row close to the schools of fish, exhausting themselves. Although they can muster the strength to fish, they must still row the boat back, consuming much of their energy on the journey. Therefore, they can only exert minimal effort on fishing. They are rarely able to return alive if they encounter

Storms: Therefore, they cannot go fishing in the deep sea, and they have to sit and wait for fish near the shore, where there are not many fish to catch. Fishermen are idle for half the year, not because they cannot produce, but because there is an urgent need for technical improvements. During my visit to Shengsi, I personally visited various nearby islands and spoke in detail with old fishermen. Currently, the most suitable and needed tool, according to most opinions, is to increase the size of the old-style back-carrying sampans (which are large fishing boats that can carry two smaller sampans). Each boat would be about thirty tons, equipped with a fifty-horsepower engine, and carry four sampans. Two boats would form a pair, used as

Mother Ships: Each day, they could also tow many smaller boats to fish in deeper waters. In addition to the smaller boats and sampans each fishing on their own, a pair of mother ships could be used like Japanese-style hand-operated net fishing vessels. If there are schools of fish or storms, the mother ships can send signals to help them move or take shelter. They are also equipped with weapons for protection. When returning, the mother ships would tow them back. In this way, each time they could catch three or four hundred dan of fish, and the working fishermen could reach more than fifty people. One pair of boats can solve the livelihood of more than fifty families, and they can produce eight or nine hundred million yuan per day, which is more convenient than new-style

Fishing Vessels: New-style fishing vessels can go out to sea for fishing only twice a month at most. Each time, they usually catch only more than 20,000 catties, or at most more than 40,000 catties, but the cost is very high, which does not benefit the fishermen and cannot be considered relief. Director Dong is now inviting fishing and shipbuilding experts to start trial-producing two pairs, aiming to improve from old-style fishing to new-style fishing and provide genuine relief for coastal fishermen. At the same time, he has obtained the support of Director Zhao of the Fisheries Administration, who will mass-produce them in the future to reduce the difficulties faced by fishermen.

### Jiangsu Province Launches Winter Clothing Drive: One Garment per Household

[Our Report from Zhenjiang, 24th] The Security and Political Department of Jiangsu Province has launched a winter clothing donation drive and will invite township chiefs on the 28th to assist in door-to-door fundraising to achieve the goal of "one garment per household." The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of the current period of suppression, has sent a special telegram to the municipal and county governments, instructing them to no longer use refreshments when receiving guests and convening meetings in order to save money. The Second Inspection Bureau of the Provincial Police Department will conduct a general household survey starting on the 25th. Those without national identity cards will be subject to administrative punishment. The Provincial Government has received an order from the Executive Yuan stating that the sharp fluctuations in food prices and the obstruction of food sources are the main reasons. Local governments and military and police units should provide effective assistance to grain merchants transporting and selling grain, as long as they comply with the regulations of the Food Control Law, and should not block them for any reason. After receiving the order, the Provincial Government has instructed the special commissioners and county chiefs to strictly comply. The Standing Committee of the Provincial Provisional Assembly has resolved: (1) to suggest that the central government strengthen the training of new recruits and improve their living conditions in order to increase the people's interest in serving in the military; (2) to request the Provincial Government to postpone the collection of food business tax.

### Good News for Sugarcane Farmers in Taiwan Sugar Producing Areas: Mobile Bank Cars Begin Operations

[Our Report from Taipei, 22nd by Ship] On the afternoon of the 20th, our reporter visited the row of mobile bank cars, a new and unique facility established by the Industrial and Commercial Bank. According to Huang Chaoqin, chairman of the bank, the mobile bank mainly goes deep into the sugarcane farming areas in central and southern Taiwan to solve the problem of issuing sugar payments for the sugar companies' factories. At the same time, it also serves the sugarcane farmers, and expands the bank's storage business, and increases the bank's deposits.

With the rise of inflation, an ordinary sugarcane farmer can receive more than a million in cash during the sugar-making season, and more than several hundred million in some cases. According to the sugar distribution method of the sugar company, if one hundred catties of sugarcane can produce ten catties of sugar, the sugarcane farmer can get five catties, of which 20% can be taken in kind, and 80% can be taken in cash. This cash is 4,000 yuan paid in advance by the company for every thousand catties of sugarcane, which needs to be paid off from December 10th to the end of April. The Industrial and Commercial Bank undertakes the lending business for 14 sugar factories, with a total amount of more than 20 billion, possibly reaching 30 billion. If the Huye Sugar Factory has 3 billion in loans, and each time 3,000 sugarcane farmers are paid, this considerable amount would be difficult for all parties if the bank could not directly handle the deposits and withdrawals on the spot. Therefore, the bank has specially prepared mobile cars, and uses a well-developed highway network to go deep into the sugarcane farming areas. A general agency was established in Tainan, and branch agencies were established in Huwei, Chiayi, and Pingtung. The mobile cars take turns disbursing funds in the designated dates and areas.

The bank has specially trained staff and temporary cashiers in important rural areas for two months. When each car (each car has two staff members, one manager, 16 to 20 temporary staff members, and the driver also works) goes deep into the sugarcane areas, they use the vehicles to distribute funds on the spot, and also conduct publicity, lectures, and visits.

Taiwanese people have a good habit of depositing money, but based on their initial operations, the results were not good. The main reason is that the sugarcane farmers have worked hard for half a year, and they always want to keep the cash for a while to feel comforted. Therefore, the deposit rate was only 1% on the first day. However, people couldn't feel safe with so much cash, so the number of deposits increased in two or three days, and reached 11% on the fourth day.

The bank does not want large sums of money to be hidden, which would increase the printing costs of banknotes or cause hoarding and speculation, thus negating the effect of the number of goods, so it hopes to deposit. The problem is how many items are deposited, and whether the paper is used to facilitate the bank's repayment. According to Fei, the funds are earmarked for rural reconstruction and production projects. At the same time, this direct deposit is enough to test the public's faith in the bank, and the economic phenomena revealed after merchants receive deposits.

The bank temporarily transferred 400 staff members to handle the mobile banking business. A conference of branch staff will be held in the south on the 24th and 25th of this month to discuss and explain the project, because this is an emerging business after all, and it needs the public's understanding.

Adopting this method to bring the bank deep into the countryside is indeed good news for sugarcane farmers, but the bank's chairman said that if the sugar company can use the American method and not adopt the deposit method, so that sugarcane farmers can use simple transfer or direct payment methods, the bank can save more manpower and financial resources, because in fact, the most experienced staff members can only count 3 million yuan in banknotes per day!

From the 21st, these twelve mobile bank cars will be scattered to the sugarcane-producing areas in central and southern Taiwan. It is hoped that the police can help and protect the safety and success of the mobile cars!

### Barber Demonstrates Public Spirit by Donating 100 Million to Build a Bridge

[Our Report from Yangzhou, 22nd] The pedestrian bridge across the north and south banks outside Fuyunmen is four-tenths complete. The bridge is wooden, with a movable section in the middle that can be opened and closed. After completion, wheels can go directly from the city to the bus station on the opposite bank. The total cost is only over 400 million yuan, which will be raised through a surcharge of 1,000 yuan per ticket for cars and ships, with fundraising as the main source of income. Mr. Ren Darong, a local barber, donated 100 million yuan alone to show his support. The Construction Committee decided to name the bridge "Darong Bridge" to commemorate Mr. Ren's public spirit.

### Precious Celebration Jewelry Store Robbed in Nanchang's Bustling Market - Five Pairs of Gold Bracelets Vanish

[Our Report from Nanchang, 22nd by Ship] On the evening of the 19th, a robbery occurred in a gold store on Zhongshan Road, a bustling street in Nanchang City. This is a major case since the city implemented its winter defense measures. The robbed gold store, Baoqing Jewelry Store, is located at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Cuihua Street, the most lively area in Nanchang City. At the time, a customer dressed in a Zhongshan suit with a gray overcoat, posing as a gold bracelet buyer, approached the counter with a blue cloth air raid bag and claimed to want to buy gold bracelets. The shop assistants looked at his appearance, and he didn't look like a wealthy customer, but they looked at the air raid bag he was carrying, and it seemed to be full of banknotes. In order to prevent any accidents, they invited the guest to the reception room to discuss business and took out five gold bracelets. He looked at them from left to right, tightly held the five bracelets in his left hand, and took out a pistol to escape. The shop assistants grabbed his overcoat but were knocked to the ground by the sound of a "bang." The uninvited guest took the opportunity to escape, firing two shots in a row, escaping towards Cuihua Street, accidentally stumbled and fell, got up and ran again. In an instant, the gold store's five gold bracelets were robbed by the uninvited guest. All the gold stores in the city immediately closed and were on high alert. The robber who robbed in public had visited several stores before entering Baoqing Gold Store, but the other gold stores acted cautiously and did not talk to him. After the robbery, Baoqing Gold Store checked the air raid bag left by the robber. It was filled with six bundles of paper money, which led to the judgment that the robber planned the deal and, after the event, investigated that several other gold stores seemed to have four or five people outside when the robber with the air raid bag contacted them. According to the news from the investigation agency this afternoon, the robber spoke with a Nanchang accent, but there are no clues so far. Song Xiangcheng, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, advocated military law for this case. If the case is solved, he will not send it to the court but will execute the robber immediately. Another news: the day before the Baoqing robbery, the Baoqing Jewelry Store next door was also robbed of two gold rings by a disguised robber. The police officers who were maintaining street traffic and security were performing their duties less than a hundred meters in front of the two gold stores when the robberies occurred.

### Decline in Liling Porcelain Industry in Hunan

[Our Report from Jingdezhen, 20th] Liling porcelain in Hunan Province is one of the famous porcelain-producing areas in China, with output second only to the fine porcelain produced in this city. The quality and craftsmanship of Liling porcelain are not considered crude among domestic products. It has a long history of more than a hundred years. Before the war, there were a total of 70 kilns, with 140,000 porcelain workers. Its products were sold in Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Kang and other provinces, with a total value of more than 50 million yuan. During the war, it fell into enemy hands, and kiln factories and porcelain merchants suffered heavy losses. Since the restoration, more than 20 kilns have resumed work, with more than 500 workers, about one-third of the pre-war number. Due to the imperfect scale and equipment, the current sales outlets in other places are only Wuhan and southern Henan. The cost of transporting porcelain from Hunan to Wuhan is more than 100,000 yuan per load, coupled with the imperfect transportation tools, the loss along the way is huge. Therefore, the future of Liling porcelain industry today, due to the narrow sales and the shortage of funds, is indeed in a state of falling off a cliff compared with the situation before the war.

Although the porcelain value this year has increased more than ten times compared with last year due to the increase in raw materials and wages, it is still difficult to improve in terms of production and sales. Recently, porcelain merchants from the producing area have come to Jingdezhen to visit porcelain-making technology and various suitable equipment, intending to go back to use them as a reference for preliminary improvements and to jointly seek the development of the industry's future. At present, Jiangxi porcelain still ranks first in the Hunan and Hubei markets, because the scale and raw material supply of Liling porcelain factories are not as good as the superior conditions of Jingdezhen porcelain. If it can be actively improved, it may be possible to restore the original market.

### Southern Great Port: A Magnificent Vision

[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, 22nd] Since Chairman T.V. Soong took office, he seems to have brought boundless hope to the people of Guangdong. Enthusiastic voices for grand construction are rising like clouds, especially the development of Huangpu Port. Ever since Chairman Soong publicly announced that "construction will start immediately, without the need for five or ten-year plans," the work of building Huangpu Port has been underway. Huangpu Port, which has attracted attention from South China and even the whole country, and the future vision of Huangpu, are perhaps what more people are eagerly awaiting a concrete understanding of.

Huangpu is located in the southeast suburb of Guangzhou, about ten miles away. It faces the South China Sea's Lion Ocean (Shizi Yang), with the Pearl River's three tributaries (East, West, and North River) converging behind it. Leaning against Crane Crown Mountain, densely forested, it slopes down to the Yuzhu Plain, stretching endlessly. Huangpu Bay at the end of the Lion Ocean has a depth of thousands of fathoms, which is a natural condition for a port. With the grandeur of mountains and rivers and the convenience of river and sea access, it is no wonder that it is the base for the largest port in the South.

The Current Situation of Huangpu

It is unexpected that it is just a deserted suburb. Climbing up on an autumn day and looking out in all directions, on the one hand, it makes people yearn for the dream of a bustling port city, and on the other hand, it also makes people feel infinitely desolate and lonely when facing the mountains and rivers. There is a Huangpu Avenue from Guangzhou to Huangpu, which can be reached quickly by car. In addition, there is a Zhongshan Road that leads directly to the Yuzhu Market on the opposite side, making transportation very convenient (recently, the Huangpu branch line of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has also been built and opened to traffic, but it only transports construction materials for the port and does not carry passengers). Simple seawalls have been built along the coast of the port. There are dozens of warehouses left over from the enemy and puppet era on the seawalls, storing a large number of railway and wharf construction materials, ready for use at any time. The simple Huangpu Wharf has been quite lively recently, and no small amount of materials has been transported in. Near Huangpu Port, there is a Huangpu Market, where the world-famous cradle of revolution, the Huangpu Military Academy, is located. The market is small but complete, with everything one could want. The market is lively, and after the port is developed in the future, it will become the "Xiaguan" of Guangzhou—the situation between Huangpu and Guangzhou seems very similar to the relationship between Xiaguan and Nanjing—what is particularly worth mentioning in the market is the Huangpu scrambled eggs, famous throughout South China for being fragrant and smooth. Perhaps the Huangpu generals who are today renowned for their exploits across the country still have lingering memories of it.

The Plan for Developing the Port

Counting it all up, it has been twenty years. During that time, due to changes in the political situation, followed by the invasion of enemy cavalry from the south, everything was "started in words and ended in words." In 1933, Guangdong had a river management committee. In the autumn of 1936, it was reorganized into the Huangpu Port Development Supervisory Office, with Mr. Zeng Yangfu in charge. The American consultant "Coolidge" was hired to come to Guangdong specifically to inspect and draft the Huangpu Port Development Plan. Construction of the first and second sandbar projects outside Huangpu Port was immediately begun, and landfilling of the embankment along the port was started, the Huangpu Avenue was built, and the roadbed for the Huangpu branch line of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was laid. Just when everything was proceeding smoothly, less than two years later, the enemy invaded, and all the efforts were in vain again. When the enemy occupied Guangzhou, they also added some engineering projects due to military needs, but after the victory, they were all destroyed. In addition, there was no one to manage it, so Huangpu once again became a barren island. The development of Huangpu Port is perhaps an ideal goal, so a large number of engineering personnel immediately came to Guangdong (including Chinese and American port experts) and drafted a port development plan. The general steps are roughly divided into four phases:

First Phase of Construction

First, complete the river excavation project and dredge the Lingdingyang sand bottom. Complete the 2.6-mile Huangpu Avenue road surface project and the Huangpu branch line and depot of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Complete the filling work in the western Wuyong and southern Zhujiangyong. Build 1,150 feet of reinforced concrete embankment, and two inspection plants, 150 feet long and 300 feet wide. Install tap water pipes and establish underground drainage channels. Build the Huangpu Port Engineering Office building and staff dormitory. Set up two elementary schools, one middle school, two police stations, and one each of fire, cleaning, and road maintenance stations, and one modern market. In total, the completion of the first phase of the plan will develop Huangpu into a city with a preliminary scale and an area of ​​93 acres, which can accommodate a population of approximately 12,000 to 15,000 people, of which the store area will account for 240,000 square feet.

Second Phase of Construction

Continue to develop the embankment to the left and right by approximately 1,800 feet to 2,300 feet, add 400 feet of market area, and the city population can increase to more than 50,000 people. Establish public utilities, and the market revenue will absorb residents to move in. Add six elementary schools, eight elementary schools, three middle schools, four markets, and establish a police headquarters and post office. In this phase of the project, based on a 100-year flood level (10.8355 meters), the height will gradually decrease from the embankment side of 10.785 and extend the embankment by 5,000 feet to prevent flooding.

Third Phase of Construction

Expand the port city, all areas north of Zhujiang Village, south of Xihua Workshop, west of Hengsha, and east of Tangkou are included. Another base west of Konghugang and east of Xuefeng Mountain is developed as a residential and commercial area. Develop water sources in Shixia and Wenchong. Add a embankment from Wuyong South to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station, and continue to complete 16,000 feet of wharf. Establish 27 elementary schools, 11 middle schools, 17 police stations, and 10 fire stations. The expansion area in this phase has reached 1,000 acres.

Final Phase of Construction

This phase is the completion phase of the development of Huangpu Port. The area includes the entire Huangpu area, north of Zhongshan Avenue, south of the starting section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Road, and east of Changzhou Port to the wild suburbs along the Dongjiang River. The total area is a wide 11,000 acres, and the projected population is 750,000 to 1 million. The development of Huangpu Port will be declared a complete success.

However, the actual difficulties have also caused many difficulties in the port development project, such as insufficient funding, lack of talent, and divergent opinions and resistance from the local area, all of which have caused the port development project to often encounter some unexpected disturbances. Perhaps the most interesting of these is the dispute over the responsibilities for developing the port.

Originally, after the central government decided on the principle of developing Huangpu Port, the initial intention was nothing more than to make Huangpu a sub-port in addition to Guangzhou Port, to supplement Guangzhou's inadequacies. However, local opinions believed that the development of Huangpu Port was a predetermined construction plan of the founding father of the country, and it was necessary to establish a port with the same value as Guangzhou. The former central government established a Guangzhou

Port Engineering Bureau

in Guangzhou this October, and appointed Tao Shuzeng as the director. This year's engineering fee is 5 billion, and it will increase to 500 billion next year. The preliminary plan for the sub-port established by the Port Engineering Bureau includes: Building the Southwest Iron Bridge, Repairing the inner port wharfs and warehouses and the Henan Daban Wharf, Dredging the Pearl River rear waterway (with the principle that 10,000-ton ships can freely enter and exit Huangpu), and the First and Second Sandbars and the Lingdingyang sand bottom, Building 75 square feet of wharfs and warehouses in Huangpu, and repairing the original wharfs and warehouses, Adding 50 cranes and tugboats each, Building the Huangpu Shipyard, Setting up all public facilities in Huangpu. The completion of the entire project plan is also easier, but it will only make Huangpu a "large wharf" for transportation, and cannot establish a perfect port city. Therefore, shortly after Chairman Soong arrived, he convened the two bureau chiefs (the director of the Pearl River Conservancy Bureau was Yang Huari) to inquire about the detailed situation in order to determine the form of port development and allocate responsibilities. Mr. Soong seemed to approve of the latter plan and has already ordered it to be implemented. Generally speaking, establishing a port in Huangpu that can be comparable to Guangzhou will no longer be a problem.

The Only Problem

is just the length of time it will take. Currently, the land price near Huangpu has changed from a price of about 10,000 yuan per well to a number of 300 Hong Kong dollars in just two or three months, and people are still rushing to buy it. It is heard that the Provincial Government and the Four Banks have jointly formed: Huangpu Port Development Company is preparing to establish large-scale enterprises in Huangpu, acquire land, and build factories and wharfs. Everyone is thinking about what a beautiful vision it will be when 10,000-ton giant ships sail directly to the Huangpu embankment. (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)

### A Stroll Through the Pen Market

[Special Dispatch on the 24th] The higher the level of modern culture, the more complex the way of life and work. At least one or two fountain pens are found in the pockets of men and women in Europe and America. In recent years, the use of fountain pens has gradually become popular in China, and it has become one of the emerging industries in major cities. According to one of the famous Parker companies that the reporter recently visited, there are a wide variety of them. The layout of the company, the lighting, the color of the products, and the spirit of the salespersons all make people feel a bit special. According to Mr. Niu Yongji, the general manager of the company, the company adopts scientific management, and personnel undergo considerable training. The business advocates modernization and socialization.

The reporter visited the pen inspection department (which is a novel name), where several technicians are using ink testing machines, writing trace machines, probes, magnifying glasses, etc., to perform local inspections on each fountain pen. The reporter asked him if the pen factory had already inspected it, why it was necessary to reinspect it. He said that the pen factory focuses on large and rapid production volume and cannot conduct detailed inspections. It is necessary to locally inspect each pen here before it can be completely completed. In 144 pens, it is guaranteed that there will not be a single one that is unsatisfactory.

Then to the pen repair department, the location is more open, and the staff wears white uniforms. They do not use manual labor, but use electric machines to repair pens. It is said that ordinary repairs, such as leaks and cleaning, are all free services, so this department loses a lot every year. There are about 20 small lathes, saws, drilling machines, money machines, polishing machines, etc. in the room. Among them, there is a machine that is the latest British-style spot plating machine, which uses strong electric sparks to spot plate platinum on the nib. It is said that the quality of a fountain pen depends entirely on the nib, and the soul of the nib is the platinum on it. If the platinum is plated round and even, writing will be smooth.

The staff in the engraving department are operating an American electric engraving machine to work. The customer can sign their name casually on paper, and it can be reduced five times on this machine to engrave a true copy. In the past year, more than 20 government agencies and business groups went to the company to buy pens and engrave them as gifts during the holidays.

The mail order department handles the business of answering inquiries, pricing, packing, and mailing. The sound of typewriters in the room never stops, and the packages on the table are piled up like cars. The reporter discovered a package that was going to Nanyang, which was very surprising. Later, I learned that people in Nanyang could have bought pens in the Philippines, but if we provide loyal service, they would rather buy them from even further away.

Later, when asked about the history of fountain pen evolution in recent years, he said that the pen was originally used with a leather tube, but because it was easy to get dirty and corroded, the American Parker Pen Company invented the vacuum tube in 1922. In addition to cleaning, it can also see the ink volume. In 1941, the 51-type pen was created with a special water-saving button inside that could not leak water, which became the culmination of fountain pens. The reporter asked: After the invention of the ballpoint pen, will fountain pens be eliminated? He said no, because ballpoint pens cannot include the wonderful ability of fountain pens to vary the thickness of the nib, but ballpoint pens are also particularly convenient for copying, registering, and traveling.

There are many pen brands on the market, and they are so beautiful that buyers don't know where to start. Which pen should I buy? He replied that fountain pens must not leak water and must have a smooth nib before they can be purchased. The pens produced by four companies, namely Parker, Eversharp, Waterman, and Sheaffer, are equipped with special non-leakage buttons, and the nibs are also finely polished, meeting the above two conditions. He was also asked about the method of protecting the pen. He said that as long as you suck and release the pen in cold water once or twice a week, you can clean the inside and avoid all kinds of diseases.

Forward Xiao Huangmao is the leader in the center, with Sun Laojin and Xiao Jin on the left, and Xia Tixian and Xiao Fei on the right. The combination is reasonable, and the charge is bound to be extremely sharp. Looking at the whole team, the attack and defense are both excellent, and it is impeccable.

### White Team's Possibility

The White team is the "possibility" team. The goalkeeper is the newcomer Xu Fusheng, with Chen Jiawan and Xu Erz appointed as left and right backs. In the center back line, Afu sits in the center, assisted by Edward and McRee, the defense is quite strong. The forwards are Long Hai, Li Yao, Qingxiang, Carlo Rique, and Grinas, the offensive power is not weak. It is predicted that there will be a bloody battle with the Blue team.

The original nine games of Group B and C football matches today were changed due to the wet ground in Zhongzheng Park.

### Taiwan Sugar 25,000 Tons Shipped to Japan, Contract Signed with Allied Headquarters, Delivery at Taiwan Pier at US$200 Per Ton, Shipped and Loaded by Allied Forces, Expected to be Completed by the End of April

[Our Newspaper Report] Mr. Song Yixin, Assistant Manager of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, flew directly from Shanghai to Tokyo on the 12th to negotiate the shipment of Taiwan sugar to Japan, and took a flight back to Shanghai yesterday afternoon after completing his business. He told reporters: Since Japan opened up foreign trade in mid-August last year, all parties have made sufficient preparations. Therefore, when foreign trade representatives arrive in Tokyo, they can quickly conduct negotiations on trade matters. At present, Japan has established a Trade Agency to manage and negotiate Japan's foreign trade affairs. After trade representatives from various countries arrive in Japan, they can first negotiate with the Japanese Trade Agency on the procedures and conditions for trade. After approval by the Foreign Trade Group of the Economic and Scientific Department of the Allied Forces, they can start processing. However, in order to adjust the surplus and deficit of Japan's domestic and foreign trade, the Allied Forces have not completely equated the domestic and export prices of a certain export commodity.

Negotiations for the first batch of Taiwan sugar to be shipped to Japan began as early as March last year. At that time, because the Japanese Trade Agency had not yet been established, negotiations were directly conducted with the Allied authorities in charge. The total amount of the first batch of sugar to be shipped to Japan was negotiated to be 25,000 tons, and the delivery price per ton in Taiwan at that time was US$335. Later, due to various reasons, the Allied Forces did not have time to send ships to transport it. In addition, the price of sugar fell day by day, and after repeated negotiations, it was decided that the transaction price would be US$200 per ton for delivery in Taiwan. The sugar payment was allocated by the Allied Forces from the funds for relief and reconstruction in Japan, so it was a cash transaction. When signing the contract, the tonnage of national ships had not yet recovered, and it was agreed that delivery would be made at the Taiwan pier, so the Allied Forces will send ships to Taiwan to load the sugar. It is expected that all of them can be loaded by the end of April this year. After the establishment of the Japanese Trade Bureau, future shipments of sugar to Japan must be negotiated with the bureau. And the foreign trade of the bureau is based on barter in principle, and the bureau itself does not have cash to import foreign goods. Therefore, the matter of shipping the second batch of Taiwan sugar to Japan still needs to be negotiated.

In addition, during this stay in Japan, the Korean Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to Japan to negotiate the import of Taiwan sugar. The reason is that the sugar originally ordered by Korea from Cuba is in danger of being interrupted due to the strike of Cuban sugar workers. Therefore, it is planned to import 120,000 tons of Taiwan sugar to adjust the supply. However, Korea's foreign barter is also mainly based on barter. And many of the materials exported by Korea are not necessary for our country. Therefore, our country still hopes to trade in cash in principle, and negotiations are still underway.

### Rice Prices Rise Again Inland, Indica and Japonica Prices Increase

A total of 7,100+ shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets yesterday. The weather was severely cold with snow flurries, and prices rose inland, stirring up people's emotions. Japonica and Indica rice both saw sharp increases, ranging from 5, 6, 7 million, and White Yuan also followed suit, rising 3, 5 million, and Yin Yuan also rose 2, 3 million. Flour digestion was active and brisk, continuing to soar by more than 20,000 yuan. At noon, the factory sold a large amount at 580,000 yuan, slightly softening the price. Bran sales to rural areas turned brisk, and prices rose sharply by 20,000 yuan.

Soybean cakes continued to be handled by guest traders, and the factory was firm in its selling price due to high raw material costs, gradually increasing by 20,000 yuan, but the closing price was light. Guest traders scrambled to purchase yellow soybeans, demand exceeded supply, and prices soared, rising another 5, 60,000 yuan. Soybean goods were held firm by merchants, and prices soared by 7, 80,000 yuan.

Individual households absorbed red beans, and guest traders also inquired actively, with a sudden increase of 5, 60,000 yuan. Broad beans also showed vitality, rising 4, 50,000 yuan. Cowpeas rose along with other commodities, rising 3, 50,000 yuan. There were not many stocks of red sorghum, and prices gradually rose by 2, 30,000 yuan.

The going out of corn in the Northern Ocean region was still slack, and raw peanuts were increasingly handled in Guangdong, with local merchants competing to purchase them, and prices continued to rise by more than 100,000 yuan. Oil mills continued to absorb sesame, with local merchants active, and deals were also made in Tianjin, with prices rising step by step, increasing by another 100,000 yuan.

The oil market rose rapidly in the morning, and then fell back at noon. As a result, the price of each oil rose by more than 100,000 yuan.

According to the person in charge of the flour market, in order to completely flatten the price of flour, the Food Department must improve the approved transshipment procedures and cooperate with the local authorities in this city in order to achieve results. In the past, flour exports were generally applied for directly to the Food Department by merchants for a transshipment license, and then purchased at high prices from the market or production areas, which had a great impact on market prices. He suggested that the Food Department should directly stipulate the amount and price of transshipped flour for manufacturers each month when examining transshipped flour in the future, and then contact the relevant authorities in this city to avoid the drawbacks of issuing too many quantities and the activities of unscrupulous merchants stimulating flour prices.

### Problem of Opening Industrial Goods, Under Study by the Joint Administration

The Review Committee for the Handling of Foreign Exchange Goods Held its 19th Meeting Yesterday Afternoon to Discuss the Review of Western Medicines and Dyes, as well as Distribution Procedures. The resolutions were as follows: 1. The original requirement for importers to apply for the distribution of originally imported goods to be stamped by the relevant trade association has now been changed to a certificate from a reputable manufacturer in order to simplify procedures and facilitate manufacturers. 2. The markup ratio for the distribution of a certain type of dye has been decided at the last meeting, but because importers raised objections, a consensus has been reached after consulting with manufacturers, and it will be announced for implementation within the next week. As for the markup ratio for Western medicines, a part has been agreed upon, but because there are many types, discussions will continue next Tuesday.

Difficult to Resume Before the Lunar New Year

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] There is no hope for the resumption of industrial loans before the Lunar New Year. In order to solve the current difficulties in the industrial sector, the government is studying other remedial measures. In North China, it has been decided that the government will purchase industrial finished products to replace industrial loans. Whether this method is applicable to the Southeast and the Beijing-Shanghai area is currently under consideration. There are rumors that a temporary emergency loan will be held before the Lunar New Year, but people from the Joint Administration denied it on the 24th, saying that this is definitely impossible.

### Running a Securities Business, It is Appropriate to Have a Noble Style

Recently, restaurants and tea houses in the city have set up securities firms. The securities exchange authorities sent a letter to the brokers association yesterday, stating: "The securities exchange is a part of the financial business, and each broker should attach importance to his own position and set up an independent business establishment for specialized operations. If it is mixed with illegal organizations such as black market gold shops or underground banks, it will inevitably be implicated. Those attached to dance halls, hotels, restaurants, and tea rooms are noisy and unsuitable. As for using coffee and meal coupons as a gimmick to attract customers, the general impression is not good. This business style seems to need to be revamped. It concerns the noble status of all brokers, and it is hereby notified that you should check and be aware of it at any time."

### India Bans Cotton Exports, No Impact on Our Cotton Exchange

Regarding India's ban on cotton exports, the person in charge of the Textile Export Committee explained yesterday: India's ban on cotton exports from yesterday only applies to the Buddhist area, such as Mumbai, while cotton in other cities such as the Muslim area can still be exported as usual. Since China and India negotiated the exchange of yarn and cloth for cotton, up to now, it has reached 100,000 bales. Although a part of the 100,000 bales that were traded is in the Buddhist area, they can still be exported as usual without any impact. Afterwards, the association notified our country's yarn and cloth merchants to continue to negotiate with Indian merchants in other Muslim areas for the exchange of yarn and cloth for cotton. Therefore, in terms of the actual situation, India's ban on cotton exports in Mumbai and other places has no impact on our exchange of yarn and cloth for cotton. In order to enrich our country's cotton sources, the association has recently negotiated with South Asian and African countries to purchase foreign cotton, but the price has not yet been determined.

However, for factories that absolutely need funds for the New Year, a purchasing method will be adopted to purchase their finished products appropriately within the New Year. A portion of export goods can be purchased. As for the purchasing plan, it has already begun to be drafted in Shanghai. Mr. Liu reported the process of this trip to Governor Zhang at noon and discussed the purchasing methods.

Provincial and Municipal Banks and Credit Institutions: Do Not Enter into Interbank Remittance Agreements

It is reported that the Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that local provinces and cities and commercial institutions have entered into interbank remittance agreements to handle remittances on behalf of customers, it is inevitable that deposits and withdrawals will occur, which is clearly inconsistent with Article 3(b) of the recently revised and promulgated Measures for Strengthening the Control of Financial Operations: "The deposits of provincial and municipal banks with correspondent banks, except those in areas where there is no central bank, may be deposited in other national banks and treasuries, shall be deposited in the local central bank in their entirety, and shall not deposit funds in other national banks and treasuries or re-deposit them in commercial institutions in any way."

### Purchasing Export Goods: Exporters Should Pay Attention to the Purchasing Price

After the announcement of the measures for purchasing export goods, exporters in this city have paid close attention to this. According to an export magnate, after the implementation of the measures, the foreign market can be expanded, but the sales matters after the China Trust Bureau purchases should be entrusted to exporters to handle in order to maintain the exporters' business and achieve the effect of earning foreign exchange. It is also said that the government's discussion on the purchasing price should be based on the following two principles: The purchasing price at the place of origin should first estimate the total production cost, and then be based on the living expenses of its producers and the production raw materials as the purchasing price at the place of origin. The purchasing price in the concentration area should be added to the freight, re-packaging and other expenses, and the legal profits of the transportation merchants, so that it can be purchased smoothly, otherwise the holders of loans may not be willing to sell.

### Commercial Briefs

The Social Bureau has transferred the order to the Department Store Association to inform all members to register nylon stockings within a limited time. The registration date is from now until the 11th of next month. After the registration is completed, the Social Bureau will convene the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industry Association to discuss and determine the sale and the sale deadline, but will not investigate its source. After the deadline, the sale of nylon stockings will be prohibited in the market, and violators will be punished.

According to news from the Shanghai Office of the Resources Committee: The output of the Resources Committee's Taiwan Aluminum Factory has been approximately 5,000 tons per month since it resumed work in mid-December last year. Currently, the raw materials are purchased from South Asia, but if the raw materials increase, the output can be increased. The Reno Company is currently preparing to invest in the factory.

The price of the goods distributed by the China Trust Bureau is much lower than the market price, so most of the distributors resell them for profit instead of directly processing them. Cao, the section chief of the Economic Section of the Police Bureau, specially convened the responsible persons of the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Industry, Wide and Narrow Belt Industry, and Knitting Industry Association yesterday afternoon to assist in investigating the distributors and manufacturers of resold materials in various industries, and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of reselling distributed materials.

### Compensation and Relief

On January 18th, the California Wheel transported the first batch of 190,000 bags of American relief flour; on January 22nd, the Haikang Wheel transported the first batch of 453 pieces of Japanese compensation machines. The former is the "help in need" of American friends to us, a substantial assistance, and the latter is the price paid by the "chief culprit of the war," the Japanese warlords, for their acts of aggression.

The significance of relief materials, as U.S. Consul General Cabot said at the welcoming ceremony: "This food is donated by the American people to the Chinese people who are currently suffering temporarily, and can be regarded as clear evidence of the United States' willingness to continue to provide relief and restore the post-war order." This sincere friendship will make the Chinese people never forget. At the same time, we firmly believe that as long as we work hard and make unremitting efforts, what is called "God helps those who help themselves," foreign aid will continue to flow in and help us overcome today's difficult and troubled situation.

The acquisition of compensation machines is what we exchanged for after eight years of the War of Resistance, sacrificing the lives and property of countless soldiers and civilians. Therefore, we feel all the more that this batch of materials is extremely precious. How to avoid waste and seek the best use of materials: How to make good use of them and engage in reconstruction and nation-building, this is the major task of the receiving institutions in the future, and it is also the ardent hope of the people of the whole country.

Relief materials and compensation materials, like rounds of new blood cells, will continue to be transported into the heart of the Republic of China. Looking forward to the future, we cannot help but feel joyful and encouraged!

### On Popular Literature

— Zhong Yu

Many years ago, I wrote many articles that examined or studied popular literature. At that time, I thought that popular literature was literature that was well-liked by the public, so advocating popular literature was a very meaningful thing. Moreover, it was worthwhile to pick up what others had discarded, and there was much to be gained in this barren field.

However, later, I suddenly thought, besides making a contribution to literary historians, what use are mere textual research and study for popular literature itself? What impact does it have on the public to simply study the authors of Yuan and Ming dramas, or to trace the origins of Ming and Qing novels? Moreover, is so-called popular literature - here, it refers specifically to storybooks, dramas, ballads, etc. since the Song and Yuan dynasties - itself worth advocating, and is it hoped that it will continue to develop? I am afraid that these questions have not been taken into account by most popular literature researchers. In fact, it is a question that should be decided first.

I believe that the mistake of most popular literature researchers is to "devalue the present and value the past", focusing solely on research without considering creation. Because they "devalue the present and value the past," they - including myself - turn a blind eye to the most popular and well-liked popular reading materials in modern society, while regarding things like the Yuan Dynasty carved edition of "The Complete Picture of Five Kinds of Pinghua" as priceless treasures. In my opinion, those Yuan carved editions of "The Complete Picture of Five Kinds of Pinghua" are really just Yuan Dynasty comic books, and the semi-literate text and superstitious and absurd ideas are simply far inferior to some of the good comic books that are popular today. The same is true of other dramas, ballads, and the like. What is there to study? If it is worth studying, then when the current comic books, after hundreds of years, exist as rare copies, will researchers regard them as "The Complete Picture of Five Kinds of Pinghua" II, and also regard them as priceless treasures? Then why don't we cherish them now and let them wait until hundreds of years later? Once this is said, we feel that it is a little ridiculous to use all our energy to study the same things from ancient times. As for saying that creation is not what I advocate must be promoted, my meaning is that if something is considered worthy of study, then it must also be applied. If we think that old popular literature has research value, then we should create new popular literature to make it develop and be useful. Otherwise, studying without creating is a futile effort.

Therefore, I am now no longer interested in researching popular literature, but rather interested in creating popular literature. Because I have seen how the sales of translated versions of world famous works and creations by famous writers cannot catch up with the sales of those novels with sensational labels, and the former may not be consulted again once they are out of date, while the latter are sold year after year. It can be seen that in China, where education is not universal and the level of knowledge has not improved, even though there is new spiritual food that is hygienic and nutritious, it is not swallowed because it does not suit the taste. Temporarily, porridge, rice and vegetables are still suitable for the public's taste and are worth improving and promoting. For example, rewriting Pushkin's "Dubrovsky" into the style of a Chinese martial arts novel, as long as the author's original intention is not distorted, the sales may not be inferior to "The Strange Hero of the Rivers and Lakes." Ba Jin's "Home" is the best-selling book, and some people say that its style is influenced by "Dream of the Red Chamber." This means that new creations that are influenced by popular novels can increase their readership. So why don't we simply go straight to the road of creating popular novels?

But what I advocate is creating popular literature, not putting new wine in old bottles, but eating big dishes with bamboo chopsticks, which is temporary, not permanent.

### The Way to Prosperity

— Hong

A traveler who crossed the continent lost his way during his journey and arrived in a remote part of the Oshkosh Mountains. It was getting late, and he was happy to see a lonely thatched cottage ahead, so he wouldn't miss a place to stay. The traveler ran to knock on the door, and a farmer came out to answer, promising to let him stay at home for the night.

After dinner, the traveler thought he should exchange pleasantries with the host for a while. "It must be difficult to maintain a rural expenditure in this place," he said. "May I ask how you support yourself?"

The host stroked his beard and pointed to the farmhand who was silently eating at the end of the table, saying, "Do you see the person eating at the table? That's right, he works for me, but I can't pay him wages. Therefore, after two years, the land will all be in his name. So I work for him, to the point where I "do" the land back. We have been doing land exchanges like this for twenty-two years, so our business is developing, and we still want to find a companion."

### Parisian Consultants

— Copper Camel

Wireless dispatches report a simple account: an aircraft passing through Paris crashed in the suburbs. Upon hearing this news, Parisians quickly sought to inquire about the downed aircraft. However, in their panicked state, they didn't need to flip through the phone book. They simply called SVP and the operator would provide detailed information about the crashed plane.

After the death of Roosevelt, the French press frantically searched their reference archives for materials on his successor, Truman, but pitifully found very little, not enough to be useful. Someone suggested, why not try SVP? One phone call provided a wealth of reference materials.

What exactly is SVP? It is an organization that uses the telephone to serve the 25 million people of Paris. SVP is an abbreviation of a French phrase, S’il Vous Plait, meaning "If you please," which I think can be freely translated as "Convenient Information," because SVP is a telephone service agency, and our early telephones were called "De Lv Feng" (德律風, transliteration of telephone). "De Yin" (德音, virtuous sound) here carries a double meaning. SVP receives thousands of inquiries daily, and most can be answered within minutes. Its service scope is so broad that it can almost be considered a living world almanac.

A child in France was critically ill, on the brink of death. The doctor said that the only savior was penicillin. The mother asked several pharmacies, all of whom said they didn't have it. Later, she asked one that also didn't have it, but they referred her to SVP. Sure enough, she received a satisfactory answer: they found a pharmacy with penicillin in stock and sent someone to urgently buy it and deliver it to her home.

A hostess in Paris was having guests over. All the guests had arrived, but one was missing, who sent a note saying they couldn't attend due to important matters. The guests looked at each other, afraid to sit down, because including the host, there were thirteen people, an unlucky number! The host was at a loss, and temporarily inviting other relatives and friends would be impolite and they might not be able to come. What to do? Suddenly, someone thought of SVP. After explaining the situation over the phone, their hope was fulfilled: within half an hour, a well-dressed representative arrived, making the total number fourteen.

An astrologer asked SVP about the founding date of the Communist Party, wanting them to provide the exact year, month, day, and hour in order to calculate the Communist Party's destiny. He said on the phone, "A famous politician is waiting for my calculation as a reference." This inquiry was answered without delay.

Most of the inquiries to SVP are about very important matters, so their work is also very demanding. SVP's clients are on a basic subscription system, with monthly fees ranging from 125 to 1,800 francs (approximately one to fifteen US dollars), depending on the number of calls and the complexity of the services. When the war ended, Remington Typewriter Company received a batch of military typewriters, numbering in the thousands, that needed to be repaired before they could be used. If they were not repainted and internally refurbished, they could not be sold or rented. The repair shop estimated it would take at least several months to repair them. SVP found Remington a repair shop that completed the repairs in a matter of weeks.

SVP was founded in 1935 by Georges Mandel, the French Minister of Transportation, who was later shot by the Nazis. Mandel worked hard from the beginning. Telephone fees increased daily, and the postal service accommodated 249 unemployed employees. Wartime and post-war France needed SVP's assistance even more. The number of employees is now five times that of the founding period, and now more than 10,000 calls come in and out every day.

The current director of SVP is Dekheim. They have a service slogan: "Simplify the lives of Parisians." Dekheim also made a contribution worth mentioning: during the war, he saw a patient being sent to the hospital lying on a wooden board, transported in a children's cart due to the lack of motor vehicles at the time. Dekheim felt compassion and came up with a passenger tricycle similar to the Shanghai rickshaw. The patient could lie in it, sheltered from the wind, and the seat was as comfortable as possible, thus alleviating many serious ailments and saving many lives.

### Clan Scholarships

— Banana Heart

As the school term is about to end, education enthusiasts are launching fundraising campaigns for scholarships to encourage impoverished students to pursue their studies and cultivate national talent. The significance of this is profound, so we should adhere to the principle of "those with strength contribute strength, those with money contribute money," and work to the best of our ability to ensure that every impoverished student has the opportunity to attend school.

Every clan in our country has an ancestral hall, and sacrifices are invariably offered in the spring and autumn seasons each year. This is originally the meaning of "remembering ancestors and tracing origins," which I do not oppose. However, these spring and autumn sacrifices, in addition to ingot paper, also include sacrificial feasts. All those participating in the sacrifice can feast, from a few tables to ten or more tables. Each sacrifice costs hundreds of thousands or even millions of yuan. Using the property accumulated by the blood and sweat of the ancestors to provide a feast for the descendants seems too unworthy. I believe that it is right for descendants to worship their ancestors, but observing the descendants going to the ancestral hall to worship ancestors, many are not "worshiping ancestors for the sake of worshiping ancestors," but "worshiping ancestors for the sake of eating." Therefore, I suggest that this "sacrificial surplus" be abolished and used as a clan scholarship. In every clan, there are rich and poor, and there are certainly many who want to study but cannot afford to. If every clan could do this, the number of impoverished students missing out on education would definitely decrease significantly; if the wealthy donate more, this serious problem of school dropout could be more than half solved. Instead of holding grand and ethereal sacrificial rituals twice a year, why not cultivate talent for the clan?

### Credit

— Yun Gong

As the saying goes, "A person cannot stand without credit." In fact, almost every transaction involving money is inseparable from credit. Sometimes, we pay the money to others first, and then get the service or item we need. Sometimes, we get the service or item first, and then pay the other party a corresponding reward. For example, going to the theater to watch a play and buying a train ticket belong to the former, while taking a rickshaw or going to a restaurant for a meal belong to the latter. Generally, the party with a higher credit standing can get the price or free enjoyment first. I often wonder if a ragged person goes to a famous and expensive restaurant to eat, would the waiters first ask him to pay a certain amount before allowing him to order?

Of course, judging a person's creditworthiness is not an easy task. Often, people with extraordinary appearances may make embarrassing jokes. According to an accountant who works in a dance hall, once a well-dressed gentleman tried to skip paying for his tea at closing time, sneaking away. He was caught by the waiters, who forced him to take off his leather shoes and let him take a rickshaw home to get the tea money before allowing him to redeem them. This seems like an inhumane fact.

Of course, we hope that everyone, even every country, can maintain good credit, saying one is one, and saying two is two. If we can truly achieve the day when, as the ancients said, "draw a line on the ground as a prison, and dare not overstep it," and countries only value trust and righteousness, then even if there are atomic bombs, they will have no use.

"Waiter," said the irate customer, "why is it that I'm paying the same price, but today's chicken is only half the size of yesterday's?"

"Well, sir," the waiter replied, "which table did you sit at yesterday?"

"On the window side."

"That's right, sir. We always give a bigger portion of chicken to the customers sitting by the window. It's the best advertisement."

### The Way of Husband and Wife

— Ge Chunliang

Several years ago, when Hollywood was filming a martial arts movie, the male lead had to jump from the wall of a fortress over a ditch and land on a stone step. It was too dangerous, so Hollywood surveyors were called in to measure it. "It's impossible!" he told the director after detailed measurement and calculation. He thought whoever jumped would definitely get injured.

The director was a rude and irritable man. He said, "Coward, what are you afraid of? I'll jump myself!"

So, he pulled the rope, jumped over the ditch from the wall of the fortress, and let go. As a result, he fell to the ground, injuring his back and legs, and stayed in the hospital for six months.

Based on this anecdote, now, when I criticize my wife's cooking, child care... etc., she never argues with me, but just says humorously, "Do you also want to pull the rope and jump yourself?" which immediately silences me. If she wants to blame me for earning too little, not hoarding and speculating, not doing stocks and gold, then I don't argue with her either, just smile and say, "Do you want to jump yourself?" – Honestly, a short joke is much more effective than arguing.

### Camera Catches Thief

— Mao Yi

Recently, a couple in California, USA, were celebrating their wedding anniversary in a bar and invited a soldier in the bar to drink with them. When he accepted, a photographer who specialized in taking pictures for people in the bar captured this joyful scene. The soldier sat for a while, thanked the male and female hosts, and then got up to say goodbye.

Afterward, the photographer sent his photos. The hostess casually glanced at one and reached out to get money to pay for it, but her wallet was missing. After developing and enlarging the photo, it clearly showed that the thief was the visiting soldier.

This kind of thing happens often, which proves that the camera undoubtedly often becomes a first-class detective. In the hands of well-trained law enforcers, bringing criminals to justice, the lens is as effective as a pistol, because no evidence presented to the court is stronger and more powerful than this photo. Unlike human testimony, the camera clearly remembers every detail. And it often sees things that the naked eye overlooks.

When the police in a Midwestern town were looking for a mysterious bombing, they had reason to suspect a worker who lived in a town thirty miles away. But they couldn't find any evidence to blame him.

However, during the investigation, a piece of wood was eventually discovered, with a layer of blurred, newspaper-like imprints on it. The police knew that the force of an explosion often caused one object to imprint on another, so they decided to photograph the imprints on the wood with an infrared camera.

In the enlarged photo, the imprint was clearly readable. It was confirmed to be part of a story published in a newspaper published twelve hours before the explosion in the worker's residence. The police put their evidence in front of the suspect, and he had no choice but to plead guilty.

Although the camera often brings criminals to justice, it also protects the innocent. A woman was accused of murdering her husband. She pleaded that her husband's death was an accidental misfortune. She said that he came home drunk that day, she met him on the lawn, he pulled out a gun to intimidate her, and then the two struggled, and unfortunately the gun went off, shooting him to death.

The prosecutor mocked this defense, asserting that she was waiting for her husband in the hallway, and when he passed through the grass, she shot him through a screen door.

The defendant's situation seemed hopeless. At this time, her lawyer presented the jury with a small package of photos. They were all photos of fired bullets, only one of which did not have intersecting marks. This bullet was taken from the body of the defendant's husband. The other photos of the bullets were all shot through the screen door into an oak door – although the resistance of the oak door was greater than that of the human body, it still could not eliminate the marks on the bullet caused by passing through the screen door.

These photos proved the woman's innocence - because the bullet that killed her husband could not have passed through the screen door.

Filming is also a major witness in countless cases. The evidence it provides is as effective as ordinary cameras, and often more spectacular. For example, in 1942, when the Attorney General of Massachusetts wanted evidence to prosecute gambling fraudsters in Boston, he gave his investigators a batch of movie cameras and filmed them near the entrance of the gangsters' headquarters. When the case went to trial, a screen was set up in the court, and the prosecutor played the "movies" they had filmed, and the faces of the gangsters who entered and left the den every day suddenly appeared on the "screen." As a result, all thirty-three scammers were convicted.

### Collection of Jokes

— Wu Yong

A woman married her husband's brother not long after her husband died, and the neighbors criticized her a lot. But she did not forget her old feelings and hung a portrait of her ex-husband in the living room. The neighbors felt a little comforted, but one day they heard the following conversation:

A guest looked at the portrait and asked the hostess, "May I ask who that handsome person is?" The remarried woman replied, "Ah, him? He is my younger uncle, who passed away not long ago."

A nouveau riche decided to give his children the best of everything in the world. He sent his daughter to college. But his daughter's grades were poor, and she couldn't keep up with her classmates, so she was ordered to drop out. When the father asked her why, she frankly confessed that her talent was not enough, and she couldn't do the homework that other students could do. The nouveau riche waved his hand and said, "That's easy, I'll buy you some talent."

At a wedding ceremony, a friend of the groom decided to study whether the guests were really listening to the polite greetings between each other. He said to every guest who passed by him: "My grandfather died today."

The guests' reactions to this sentence were as follows: "Ah, that's great!" "Thank you!" "What you said is really interesting!" No one really knew what he was saying. The groom was even more confused. He replied with a smile, "You should take the same steps!"

Correction - In the article "Thinking of Yan Song" by Zhou Lengjun published in this magazine on the 23rd, Yan Song was mistakenly identified as a Song Dynasty person. The editor failed to notice this and did not correct it in a hurry. Fortunately, reader Ye Shouming pointed out the error in his letter. In addition to expressing deep gratitude to Hua Jun, we hereby correct it.

### Carefree Flower

Chapter 9: Leaking Secrets (52)

Qi Wan urged him several times, but Zhu Zhai had no results. Thinking that Zhu Zhai was an amateur in terms of real estate, she entrusted someone else. In a few days, she finalized a building on Fenfang Liuli Street. Without notifying Zhu Zhai, she waited until the payment, writing, and vacating the house were all done before telling Zhu Zhai. When Zhu Zhai heard that Qi Wan had already bought the house, he was stunned for a moment, speechless for a long time. Seeing him in a daze, seemingly disapproving, Qi Wan smiled and said, "Zhu, why don't you understand what I mean? I'm doing this for our own good. Isn't it more respectable if we buy a house and then get married? You propose a travel wedding, but I think it's too hasty. Since you divorced your wife, there's nothing legally wrong with you remarrying, so why should we be so compromising? Besides, marriage is a major life event, and it only happens once in a lifetime, so it has to be glamorous. As for all the expenses, I've budgeted for them, and I'm capable of bearing them all, so you don't have to worry. There's also a reason why I bought this house. The house I live in now was left by my father. It's okay for me to live in it, but I still think I have older and younger brothers, and they have to share equally. Now that I'm capable and can afford to buy a house, of course I have to buy one and give this one to my younger brother. That's the right thing to do. The house I bought is an old-fashioned building. You're an artist, full of artistic talent, and you can definitely help me. After you renovate it, it will definitely be beautiful. You don't have to worry about the cost, just strive for perfection." Seeing that Qi Wan had already settled the house, and what was done could not be undone, and seeing her so enthusiastic, Zhu Zhai had to obey her wishes and smiled, "You just told me to renovate it, but I don't even know what the house looks like." Qi Wan said, "The house is old-fashioned. It's hard to explain. I'll take you to see it now." After saying that, she put on her coat and went to Fenfang Liuli Street with Zhu Zhai. When Zhu Zhai saw the house, the facade was okay, but it was too old. After looking around, he asked, "What are your plans?" Qi Wan said, "I'm waiting for the artist to decide!" Zhu Zhai said, "I think this drooping flower gate should be removed first. It not only takes up space but also isn't aesthetically pleasing." Qi Wan nodded and said, "I also have this opinion." Zhu Zhai said, "Once the drooping flower gate is removed, the yard will look bigger, and you can plant more flowers and trees. The front building has five rooms upstairs, one as a bedroom, two as guest rooms, one as a study, and one as a bathroom. The five rooms downstairs will have three large living rooms and two dining rooms, which should be enough. The remaining six rooms in the east and west wings can be used for storing things, and the servants' quarters underneath should also be enough to distribute."

▲To Mr. Huang Menrong: It is currently quite difficult to award additional awards. Since there is already a divided list, the apportionment of military expenses already has fairness. Based on the request, the excess quota has already been decided. The company's fine is naturally borne by the locals. Now that a dispute has arisen, it is clear that Ding does not understand the situation. It seems appropriate to inform him of the pros and cons and revise the apportionment ratio.

▲To Mr. Song Fuliang: Due to limited space, incoming manuscripts cannot all be published. Furthermore, it is very difficult to find someone who a friend wants to visit, even though they once served in the press, but their name is unknown. It is better to post an advertisement, which may be effective.
