### Wu Manyou and Yang Jingqu Broadcast, Revealing the Lies of the Communist Bandits; Awakening Compatriots Nationwide to Conclude the Suppression of the Rebellion

They will continue to broadcast on the 27th and 28th at 1:25 PM and 8:20 PM each day. The long wave is 416.6 meters, with a frequency of 720 kilohertz. The short wave is 24.6 meters, with a frequency of 12200 kilohertz. The broadcasts are also being jointly relayed by the Central, Air Force, Capital, Yishi, Jinling, Jianye, and Youth radio stations in this city, as well as military branch stations in Hankou, Xi'an, Beiping, Guangzhou, and Shenyang. The original text of their broadcasts is as follows:

Full text of Wu Manyou's broadcast

Dear elders, brothers, and sisters, my name is Wu Manyou. I am 55 years old and from Wu Jia Zao Yuan in Yan'an, northern Shaanxi. In order to utilize me, the Communist bandits selected me as a labor hero of the border region. I have served as the vice chairman of the Yan'an County Council, the principal of the Farmers' University, the director of the Red Army Dependents Support Office, and the chief of the Civil Affairs Department of the Second General Team, as well as the captain of the stretcher team. Last year, the National Army overcame Yan'an, and I was forced to join the army. This April, I was captured by the National Army while fighting in 董東 with Peng Dehuai's troops. I thought I would surely die. Unexpectedly, not only did I not die, but I also enjoyed the government's love and preferential treatment everywhere. My speech, actions, and daily life are all very free. In the six months I have been with the government, my body has gained eight or nine pounds. This is worthy of consolation to those in the bandit area who care about me.

I am an illiterate farmer. Mao Zedong and his bandits used sweet words to coax me into becoming a labor hero, a vice chairman, and a university principal. In reality, they only valued my ability to engage in production. They thought I was honest and could be deceived, so they used some nice-sounding titles to elevate me, but in essence, they wanted me and farmers like me to work ourselves to death to solve the food shortage for their troops and agencies. From 1938 to 1946, my family paid more than two hundred ancestors in public grain. All I got was a hypocritical labor hero title and an empty stomach. Mao Zedong's ability to deceive people is truly enough 傎.

Since arriving in the government area, I have passed through Xi'an and Nanjing. I have walked through cities and villages. What I have seen and heard, compared to northern Shaanxi, is truly the difference between heaven and hell. The people in the government area can speak and act freely. The taxes they pay are very light, unlike the Communist bandits who extract arbitrarily and endlessly. Even conscription is carried out according to reasonable procedures, unlike the Communist bandits who use struggle and threats to grab everyone, regardless of age or gender. In short, the lives and property of the people in the government area are fully guaranteed. Therefore, I understand that Mao Zedong's criticism of the government is entirely out of malicious propaganda and slander.

Now that the government has implemented currency reform, all prices are very stable. Therefore, people who farm and do business feel that there are ways and hope. Everyone is working hard on their own farming and production with the help of the government. Everyone is living a stable life with sufficient food and clothing. So I want to advise my compatriots in the bandit area: Don't be deceived by the Communist bandits anymore. Unite quickly and implement non-cooperation with the bandits. As long as we, the people, are not used by them, the Communist bandit rebellion will not succeed. The government can then implement comprehensive construction, and we can have a life of peace and happiness. (Continued on page 2)

### Editorial: The Soviet Union's New Attitude Toward the Japanese Question

The Soviet Union's attitude toward the Japanese question has recently undergone a new shift. Regarding the conclusion of a Japanese peace treaty, the Soviet Union advocates convening a peace conference. Regarding the limits of Japan's industrial level, Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, presented a new proposal at the Far Eastern Commission on the 23rd, advocating that Japan's industry should develop into peacetime industry, but that the control of this industrial recovery should be carried out by countries most concerned with preventing new Japanese aggression. He also said that giving Japan several years of unrestricted revitalization of its industry under the control of various powers, in order to prevent Japan from building new military institutions, would not be a cause for concern in itself. After Pan Youxin's proposal was announced, U.S. officials felt deeply surprised, and Japanese political circles felt even more excited. If this proposal is sincere and does not carry any smokescreen effect, it is indeed a noteworthy matter for the improvement of U.S.-Soviet Far East relations and the clarification of the Japanese question.

More than three years have passed since Japan's defeat and surrender, and not only has a peace treaty with Japan not been concluded, but even the procedural issues of the preparatory meeting for the peace conference have yet to be resolved due to disputes among the nations. Due to the opposition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the Far Eastern Commission has lost its luster; due to the divergence of opinions among the control authorities, meetings of the Tokyo Control Council for Japan often end unhappily in a short period of time. The Soviet Union is dissatisfied with the United States' unilateral control of Japan's policies, but does not put forward active and constructive methods to improve the situation. The United States ignores the intervention of allied countries and the Far Eastern Commission, and actively and unilaterally supports Japan, repeatedly publishing reports to raise Japan's industrial level, stimulating the national sentiments of Far Eastern countries. If this unreasonable and irregular phenomenon continues to develop, the future of U.S.-Soviet relations is worrying, and the fear of Far Eastern countries about new Japanese aggression is even more worrying. Standing from China's position, we really do not want this deteriorating situation to continue to develop. We would like to see the harmony of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the opening up of the predicament of the Japanese question, and even more so, a peaceful and democratic Japan realized under the supervision and control of a peace treaty, thereby restoring friendly relations between China and Japan. Based on this viewpoint, in addition to focusing our attention on the Soviet Union's change of attitude, we also hope that wise politicians will quickly find a way to break the deadlock and not use this as a performance of the Cold War.

The biggest problems of the contradictions and opposition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the Far East are the problems of Korea and Japan. The Korean problem appears to be deadlocked on the surface, but in fact, as long as the U.S. and the Soviet Union change their minds, the Korean problem can be resolved peacefully and unified. The Japanese problem is more complicated, and the only way to solve it is to convene a Japanese peace conference and conclude a Japanese peace treaty. The dispute over the procedure of the peace conference is a dispute for advantage. If the opinions on the content of the treaty are consistent, the holding of veto power is a secondary issue. The key to the content of the peace treaty lies in the economy, and the core economic issue is the determination of Japan's industrial level, which is related to both the compensation issue and Japan's political system and people's livelihood. In recent years, the Soviet Union's attitude has been to oppose Japan's high industrial level and to criticize Japan's economic recovery. It has given ruthless refutation to the "Strike Report" and the "Johnston Plan." In fact, the United States has not yet submitted these two plans to the Far Eastern Commission as official documents, and the countries of the Far Eastern Commission still have a shortcut to compromise with the United States. Mr. Pan Youxin's proposal has several points worth noting: first, he does not oppose Japan's high industrial level, but only limits it to peacetime industry; second, he does not oppose Japan's economic recovery, but it should be implemented under the control of various countries; third, he emphasizes compensation and satisfies the demands of countries that have suffered aggression; finally, he declares that the Soviet government has no reason to limit Japan's future industry. Mr. Pan is a young and cautious Soviet diplomat who is well aware of the Far Eastern situation. His words represent the Soviet government, and we are unwilling to make a hasty judgment as to whether his new proposal is valued by the U.S. government. However, the change in the Soviet Union's attitude toward the Japanese question is a new fact. Standing from China's position, we are interested in the Soviet Union's new attitude. Therefore, we await the reaction of the Far Eastern Commission to the Soviet Union's new proposal, in order to seek a shortcut to compromise.

Regarding the question of determining Japan's industrial level, we theoretically do not approve of the "Strike Report" and the "Johnston Plan." We believe that the principle of determining Japan's industry at the current stage is the case of the "Determination of Peaceful Needs of Japan" passed by the Far Eastern Commission on January 23, 1947, in which representatives of all member countries raised their hands in favor and no one raised any objections. Mr. Pan Youxin's new proposal may be based on this case, which shows that the Soviet Union's opinion lies in promoting the completion of a peace treaty with Japan. Our country is in favor of this case, and the U.S. government has never proposed an amendment to this case, so this case exists in law. Since the member countries of the Far Eastern Commission have no major discrepancies on the principles of Japan's industrial level, in terms of the situation, it should be the time to convene a Japanese peace conference. Therefore, we re-propose the advocacy, hoping that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will further coordinate, quickly convene a peace conference, and conclude a Japanese peace treaty, so as to make a clear solution to the uncertain Japanese problem.

### Repercussions of the Liang Biguo Suicide Incident: The United States Pays Attention to the Immigration Issue; Procedures for Overseas Chinese to Go to the United States are Agreed to be Improved

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 25th] Since Ms. Liang Biguo (transliteration), aged 32, committed suicide in the immigration detention center here on the 21st of this month, this question has paid great attention to our country's immigration issues in the past three days. The first reaction is that the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California issued a statement on the 22nd, calling for the closure of the overcrowded immigration detention center on Sansome Street here, and also suggesting two concrete ways to improve the immigration entry procedures: (1) Immigration detention should not exceed one month; (2) The right of foreigners to enter the United States should be determined before they board the ship to come to the United States. In addition, the San Francisco Chronicle has published three special articles on immigration issues, respectively examining: (1) the situation of immigration detention centers, (2) the efforts of Immigration Director Wilkinson here on immigration matters, and (3) why some immigrants have been detained for several months! According to the materials provided by Director Wilkinson, the newspaper stated that no fewer than thousands of overseas Chinese who arrived in the United States and obtained entry without difficulty. However, from September 1946 to April of this year, a total of 383 Chinese immigrants were detained. Among them, 319 were granted entry after the second hearing of the Inquiry Committee, and another 574 were granted entry after the Committee's retrial. During this period, only 66 people were ordered to be deported, but only 25 of them actually returned to China as ordered, while the rest remained in the United States, attempting to go through legal entry procedures.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] News from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Regarding the fact that overseas Chinese are often detained by the San Francisco Immigration Bureau due to procedural issues when going to the United States, the Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed our embassies and consulates in the United States to negotiate improvements. The U.S. government recently sent the Director-General and Deputy Director-General of the Immigration Bureau, together with the Director of the Immigration Group of the Senate, to San Francisco to investigate and discuss improvement measures. As a result of the contact with our Consulate General in San Francisco, the following improvement measures have been drafted: (1) Increase the number of immigration examiners to clear backlog cases. (2) Accelerate the examination procedures as much as possible. (3) If the re-approval conditions cannot be determined after the preliminary examination, the person concerned may post a guarantee of 500 to 1,000 yuan to be released first. (4) The immigration detention center can only accommodate more than 300 people, and the old site of the Seamen's Union outside San Francisco should be used immediately.

### Agricultural Bank of China in Four Provinces Conducts Fertilizer-for-Rice Exchange, Expected to Collect More Than 17,000 Metric Tons

### Wu Manyou and Yang Jingqu Broadcast to Expose the Communist Bandits' Tricks

Full Text of Yang Jingqu's Broadcast Speech

Elders, brothers, and sisters across the country, my surname is Yang, and my name is Jingqu. I joined the Communist New Fourth Army Yu-E-Wan Border Region Li Xiannian's unit in August 1940. I served as the Deputy Chairman of the Border Region Government, Brigade Commander, Detachment Commander, and Commander of the Third Military Sub-district. I was in the bandit area for five years and eleven months before leaving the Communists in July 1945.

During these six years, I learned about everything about the Communists. Now let me give a brief report so that my compatriots across the country can recognize the true face of the Communists.

(Continued from the first page)

First of all, I want to explain that the Communist Party has no motherland. Their slogan is world revolution. They are commanded by the Communist International (that is, the Soviet Union). The Communist International is above everything else, that is to say, they are all for the Communist International, for the Soviet Union. If something happens that is beneficial to the Soviet Union but detrimental to the motherland, they will undoubtedly sacrifice the motherland. Judging from the CCP's attitude toward the Northeast issue and from the Soviet Union's refusal to allow China to participate in the foreign ministers' meeting on the German peace treaty, their words and actions are completely in line with the Soviet Union and betray the motherland. This proves that if the Chinese Communist Party succeeds, China will become a vassal state of the Soviet Union and will no longer be China.

The Communist Party advocates proletarian revolution, but what the Chinese Communist Party has created is a rogue dictatorship. They not only use violence to confiscate the property of the middle class and carry out cruel liquidation struggles, but also confiscate the grain that farmers have earned through labor in the name of "supporting the front line and donating grain." After strict struggles and liquidation, no one runs the factories, and the workers have no way out. They have all become prisoners of the Communists. The Communists force workers to join the army as cannon fodder or force workers to pay for the work they can afford. However, the Communists do not care about the welfare and health of the workers at all. Therefore, although the Communists shout for the peasant and worker revolution and the proletarian dictatorship, in reality, the peasants are cattle and horses, and the workers are slaves. Good peasants and workers are exploited and oppressed. The Communists only use their labor as a tool for increasing production and use their lives as rebellious capital.

And generally, hooligans and loafers do not engage in production and rely on fighting others to support themselves. They have become new parasites, replacing the old exploiters. The Communists consider them to be active elements and support and encourage them, allowing them to run rampant. Therefore, today's bandit area has become the world of hooligans.

The Communists treat peasants and workers like this, and they are even more brutal to the middle class and the rich. Not only is all their property confiscated, but they also suffer all kinds of torture and humiliation. In the end, they are made to die miserably.

Therefore, I hope that my compatriots across the country will recognize the style and methods of the Communists and rise up together to quell the rebellion in order to safeguard the motherland. The working class should not be deceived by the Communists' propaganda. If the Communists succeed, you will suffer even more. Especially the rich and powerful, if you are not willing to contribute money and effort to support the government in quelling the rebellion, once the Communists succeed, not only will your property immediately be turned into nothing, but you will also die without a burial place. To protect your lives and property, you must quickly wake up and take out money to support the government in quelling the rebellion, otherwise you will regret it too late.

Finally, I remind my compatriots across the country to quickly contribute money and effort to support the government in implementing the Three People's Principles, eliminate the Communists, and safeguard the integrity of the motherland's territory and sovereignty, maintain the existence of a democratic and free system, carry out a moderate social revolution, avoid bloody struggles, drive out the red fascists, and enable the Chinese nation to embark on the road to construction and revival again and become a free, democratic, prosperous, and happy new China. (The End)

### Four-Power Talks on Berlin Issue Break Down; Resolved to Submit to Security Council for Handling; Soviet Reply Insists on Controlling Air Corridors

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 26th (Broadcast): The three countries, the United States, Britain, and France, issued a communiqué on the 20th, stating that the dispute between the three countries and the Soviet Union regarding the Berlin issue will be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for handling. This was decided by the foreign ministers of the three countries after consultation. U.S. sources said that the three foreign ministers plan to convene another meeting on the evening of the 26th. The three nations decided to end negotiations with the Soviet Union, mainly because the Soviet side raised the demand to control the air corridors.

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 26th (Broadcast): Experts from the Western powers held a meeting in the afternoon of the 26th to continue studying the necessary steps to be taken by the Western powers in submitting the Berlin issue to the Security Council. It is expected that the three countries' note to the Soviet government will be sent to the United Nations together with a memorandum explaining the three countries' attitude. The three countries' reply to the Soviet Union will be drafted by the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, the British Undersecretary of State, Strabolgi, and the French Undersecretary of State, de Merville. The foreign ministers of the three countries may hold a meeting to approve the reply.

[United Press, Paris, 26th] The three Western powers decided on the 26th to submit the Berlin crisis to the United Nations Security Council because the Soviet Union, in its reply to the three powers' "final note," refused to lift the Berlin blockade. They also decided to stop direct negotiations with the Soviet Union and appeal to world public opinion. The three powers condemned the Soviet Union's recent note as "unsatisfactory" and accused the Soviet Union of violating the four-power understanding by "unilaterally" publishing the contents of the negotiations. The Soviet Union's recent note is regarded as the final blow to the four-power talks that began in early summer. A Western spokesperson said, "In the long period of negotiations in Berlin and Moscow, the Soviet Union never raised the demand to control air traffic between Berlin and the Western occupied zones." However, in the recent note, the Soviet Union raised this counter-demand, not only attempting to control the land and water traffic that it had blockaded since early summer, but also further attempting to control air transport.

The three powers' communiqué stated in brief: "The Soviet government has failed to guarantee the request to lift the illegal blockade of Berlin, as proposed by the three governments in their note of September 21, 1948. Moreover, it has made a demand to place all commodity transport and passenger traffic via air, waterway, railway, and highway between Berlin and the Western occupied zones under the control of the commander of the Soviet occupying forces in Germany. Furthermore, regarding the currency issue, the Soviet note is evasive and does not provide a clear answer to the attitude expressed by the three governments. Therefore, the three governments have no choice but to notify the Soviet government, fully explaining their position and informing the Soviet government that, based on the Soviet government's firm insistence on continuing the blockade and restricting air traffic, they are forced to submit this matter to the United Nations Security Council in accordance with their obligations under the United Nations Charter." The three foreign ministers held an emergency meeting lasting ninety minutes at the French Foreign Ministry before dinner. They quickly agreed on the above action and will meet again in the evening to draft their letter to the Security Council.

### Soviet Side Unilaterally Announces Negotiation Process; Makes Counter-Demands to the Three Powers; Berlin's Land, Sea, and Air Traffic Must Be Controlled by the Soviets

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] TASS issued a statement this morning regarding the Berlin situation and the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the three Western powers in August and September concerning this issue. The statement mentioned that in the Soviet government's note to the United States, Britain, and France on July 14, it pointed out that the Berlin situation was caused by the three countries' violation of the Potsdam Agreement and the agreement on controlling Germany and Berlin. TASS continued that the reason for the Western powers' violation was to unilaterally carry out currency reform in the western sectors of Berlin, and at the same time, the Western powers attempted to achieve a policy of splitting Germany.

The statement accused the Western powers of trying to extend their influence into the eastern occupied zone of Germany, causing the economic disintegration of the eastern zone. This situation forced the Soviet Union to take restrictive measures on traffic between Berlin and the western zones to protect the interests of the people in the Soviet zone of Germany and the lifeline of the economy. The statement also mentioned that in early July, the three Western powers had proposed a joint suggestion to the Soviet government, requesting a review of the Berlin situation and the consequences arising from this matter, and the Soviet government expressed its acceptance of this suggestion. According to TASS, the suggestion pointed out that after the Soviet Union and the Western three powers' military commanders in Berlin held negotiations in August, they agreed to implement the following points: (1) Restrictions on passenger and trade transport between Berlin and the three governments in the western zones, as well as the transport of goods from the western zones to the Soviet zone or from the Soviet zone to the western zones, should be lifted; (2) At the same time, the East Mark will be the only currency in circulation in Berlin, and the use of the Western Mark should be prohibited in Berlin. It also stated that the four powers had agreed that the circulation of the Western Mark in Berlin and the regulations regarding currency circulation in Berlin should be under the joint jurisdiction of the four powers. According to the Soviet statement, the reason why the negotiations did not continue was due to three major disagreements between the Soviet Union and the military commanders of the three Western powers: (1) The Soviet government insisted that the transport of passengers and goods between Berlin and the West, including river and road transport, be placed under the control of the Soviet military commander, and that air routes also be subject to control; the four powers also agreed to control the currency in Berlin and the transport between Berlin and the West. (2) The Soviet Union believes that the four-power financial committee and its assigned task of handling currency circulation in Berlin must comply with the agreements concluded by the four powers in Moscow. The Soviet government cannot accept the expansion of this committee's functions to the point where it has the right to interfere in regulations concerning currency circulation throughout the Soviet zone. (3) Regarding the trade between Berlin and the West, and the three countries, the Soviet government agrees to follow the instructions of the United States, Britain, and France, establish a four-power control agency in Berlin, and agree to issue appropriate trade permits to resolve existing differences between the four powers regarding this issue. The statement concludes that the above facts are sufficient to show that the Soviet government's position on resolving the Berlin situation is based on conditions acceptable to all parties concerned. Under these conditions, whether negotiations on this issue should be stopped or whether the four countries should reach a satisfactory agreement, the only key depends on the attitude of the United States, Britain, and France.

The Berlin stalemate reminds people of the Tsars of old Russia, who are carefully considering how to deal with the Ruhr and other regions! (Originally published in the New York Times)

### Soviets Intensify Blockade of Berlin; Form Surveillance Network to Control Land Traffic; Train 100,000 Militiamen to Suppress Resistors

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 25th] According to unconfirmed reports: 5,000 German police officers have arrived here from the Soviet Union. They will organize a "surveillance network" to control highway and railway traffic, guard train stations, and patrol the suburbs to intensify the blockade of Berlin. They are all former prisoners of war who joined the "Free Germany Committee" and received special training in the Soviet Union.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 25th, United Press] According to well-informed American sources: The army controlled by Seydwitz, chairman of the Soviet-occupied province of Saxony in Germany, will train a force of approximately 100,000 skilled armed civilian police, so that after the occupying forces withdraw, they can control all of Germany and suppress all resistance. According to the "World Report," this action is currently being carried out in conjunction with strengthening the political position of the Communist Party in the Soviet-occupied zone.

[United Press, Berlin, 25th] One hundred and fifty German communists held a meeting in the British-occupied sector of Berlin on the 25th, with a crowd of approximately 2,500 people, most of whom were onlookers and anti-communist questioners. Over a hundred German doctors from the British-occupied zone were on alert around the perimeter to prevent conflicts. However, when a group of anti-communist youths attempted to disrupt the meeting, a small conflict resulted. Approximately fifteen youths attempted to rush the stage but were driven back by the police, and two were injured. The British military government ordered the police to maintain order because the Communist Party had legally obtained permission to hold the meeting.

[United Press, Batavia, 26th] Antara, the official news agency of the Republic of Indonesia, reported on the 26th: The Communist Party, in another successful coup, has occupied the town of Purwokerto, which is only 60 kilometers from Yogyakarta, the capital of the Republic. The leader of the coup, Lieutenant Colonel Soejoto, formerly of the government army, has declared the establishment of a "National Front" government in the area, appointing himself as the chief executive.

In addition, the Communist Party launched a rebellion in Parakan, 70 miles from Yogyakarta, but it has been surrounded by government forces and is currently negotiating surrender. The Communist Party also rioted in Ponorogo, opening fire on government forces and police, but it has been surrounded by government forces. Government forces attacking the city of Madiun made no progress on the 26th.

### UN General Assembly Reopens Today

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Today marks the end of the first week after the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, and many delegates and attendants plan to visit Versailles and Paris and its suburbs. The next meeting of the General Assembly is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Monday, and the Security Council is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to consider Spitzbergen's application to join the International Court of Justice.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 25th] The United States has formally responded to the Soviet Union's proposal for a one-third reduction in armaments by the four powers. A spokesperson for the U.S. delegation to the General Assembly declared, "We are willing to carefully study any proposal that is compatible with the control plan of the Atomic Energy Commission or that conforms to the principles of general armaments passed by the majority of member states of the Ordinary Armaments Commission." However, the gist of this is directed at the Soviet Union's insistence over the past year in opposing the proposals made by the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission and the majority of member states of the Ordinary Armaments Commission. Therefore, in effect, the United States' statement implicitly states its position as, "If the Soviet Union agrees to the international safeguards and controls that it has previously consistently opposed, we will then consider the Soviet Union's proposal for a one-third reduction in armaments."

### Hurricane to Hit Hong Kong

[United Press, Hong Kong, 26th] The British Navy cancelled all shore leave on the 26th and ordered ships to prepare to avoid the hurricane approaching Hong Kong.

### U.S. Shippers Protest Reconstruction of Japanese Merchant Ships; Soviets Will Intensify Attacks on U.S. Far East Policy

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] Several U.S. shipping company owners have formally protested the Johnston Report, which recommends restoring Japanese merchant ships to the standard of 1930-1934. The American Shipowners Association, representing more than two-thirds of the American shipping industry, sent a letter to Army Secretary Lapham on the 22nd, requesting that the recommendation to restore Japanese ships to four million tons should be implemented only after all circumstances prove that this action is not contrary to sound domestic and foreign policies.

Whether Japan should be at a higher level than the United States in international shipping is questionable, especially since Japan's recovery still relies on U.S. economic support. It is unfair for the United States to economically support Japan, allowing it to surpass neighboring allied countries in economic stability and living standards. This matter requires more consideration, and the consequences of the United States supporting Japan's economic recovery with its economic power should not be ignored.

[United Press, Washington, 26th] American observers predict: The Soviet Union will further concentrate its attacks on U.S. Far East policy, especially U.S. policy towards Japan and Korea. They said: The statements made by Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin at the recent two meetings of the Far Eastern Commission show that the Soviet Union has shifted its attention to the East.

### Japanese Go Master Battles Wu Qingquan

Honinbo Likely to Suffer Crushing Defeat After Losing Three Games in a Row

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The go match between Japanese go master Honinbo and Wu Qingquan is now in its third game. (A total of ten games will be played.) Wu won the first and second games.

According to go rules, if Honinbo loses four games in a row out of the ten, he will be considered defeated. Therefore, Honinbo must do his best in the third and fourth games. If Honinbo fails, then all other ranked go players in Japan will naturally not be Wu's opponents.

### Major Theft Case at Tiger Balm Yong An Tang Solved; Over 30,000 U.S. Dollars Vanish; Acting Manager Confesses to Being the Thief; Soccer Player Cao Qiuting Almost Wrongfully Accused

[Our Dispatch] Hu Weizhi, the person in charge of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, reported to the Old Gate Police Station at approximately 11:15 p.m. on the 24th, stating that 39,000 U.S. dollars had been stolen. According to Hu's report: On the 18th, he retrieved 200 taels of gold and 50,000 U.S. dollars that he had previously deposited with a friend surnamed Zheng in Nanjing. At 7:00 a.m. on the 19th, he arrived at the Yong An Tang branch on Ningbo Road No. 595 in Shanghai, and that evening at approximately 7:00 p.m., he handed the U.S. dollars and gold he had brought to acting manager Zheng Yuangui to be locked in the safe. However, because the amount was too large, he was afraid of attracting attention. So that evening, he purchased three airplane-style Chinese leather suitcases from the Bosideng Leather Goods Company and took the U.S. dollars out of the safe, hiding them in specially made cloth bags inside the suitcases. At that time, acting manager Zheng directed the distribution of the U.S. dollars into the suitcases. As for the 200 taels of gold, it had already been sold to the Guohuo Bank on the 20th. At 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd, he opened the first light yellow suitcase, and the 11,000 U.S. dollars contained within were sold to the Guohuo Bank in full. The remaining two dark yellow suitcases, containing 39,000 U.S. dollars, remained sealed in the bedroom. Until approximately 8:00 a.m. on the 24th, Cao Qiuting (a soccer star), an employee from the Hong Kong headquarters, and Jin Lu sent his younger brother back to Hong Kong from Longhua Airport. After finishing the task and returning to the store, Cao stated that the airport security was strict, and some people were even paying attention to their actions. Therefore, he was concerned that the suitcases stored in the store might be unsafe and suggested that the two dark yellow suitcases be transferred to a friend surnamed Zhu's place for safekeeping. Hu refused directly because these U.S. dollars were about to be sold to the Guohuo Bank, and there was no need for a futile trip back and forth. Subsequently, Cao Qiuting took them away, intending to deliver them to the Guohuo Bank on his behalf. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 a.m. that morning, Hu suddenly received a phone call from Cao, saying: The two suitcases contained only 1,640 U.S. dollars, and the rest of the money had vanished. Because the incident was so bizarre, he reported it to the police to arrest the thief.

After receiving the report, Zhao Zhaosheng, chief of the Old Gate Police Station, personally led Criminal Section Chief Jiang Shangpei, section member Zhang Kuidong, and police officer Sun Juemin to rush to the scene for a detailed investigation. The result was that no clues could be found. After inspecting the cloth bags in the three empty suitcases, there were also no flaws. However, the most suspected in this case were Cao Qiuting and driver Qiu Youxiang, who were responsible for delivering and opening the money, Zheng Yuangui, who directed the packing, and packer Chu Yingqiu. All four were taken to the police station for questioning. According to Cao Qiuting's confession, he did indeed obtain three suitcases from Hu at 7:55 a.m. He hired a car from the Taishan Motor Company to take him to his home at No. 9 Xinsheng Lane, Jianguo West Road. He opened the suitcases to take out the stored U.S. dollars and transfer them to the bank. Unexpectedly, after opening the three suitcases, he discovered that only 1,640 U.S. dollars remained. He immediately carried the three suitcases back to Yong An Tang in the same car and handed them over to Hu Weizhi for inspection. He had not committed any theft. According to the driver's confession: The car stopped at the alley entrance for 25 minutes. He saw Cao carrying the original suitcase out and returning to Yong An Tang, and he did not get out of the car along the way.

Proving Honesty

According to acting manager Zheng Yuangui's confession: He is Hu's close relative. At the time, Hu was by his side and vigorously stated that Zheng was honest and had not been in office for long. He had no relatives or friends in Shanghai and did not believe he would commit theft. As for the packer Chu Yingqiu, there were many people monitoring him when he was packing, so he would not have committed theft either. At this point, Cao's suspicion seemed greater, so police officers went to the homes of Cao Qiuting and Chu Yingqiu to investigate, and everything matched their confessions. At this time, the police station learned that Zheng had secretly reported to the Economic Brigade that Hu was suspected of hoarding gold and cash, and his intention was obviously to try to get the Economic Brigade to summon Hu for interrogation. He dared not directly say the correct amount of U.S. dollars to cover up the theft.

Finally Confessing the Truth

Section Chief Jiang personally questioned Zheng strictly, and Zheng could not hide it any longer. He finally confessed the whole story, admitting that at 12:00 a.m. on the 22nd, after assisting the worker Chu Yingqiu in finishing packing the suitcases, he carried the two suitcases to Hu's bedroom. At that time, Hu was already fast asleep. He secretly carried the two suitcases to his own bedroom and, while the paste was not yet dry, pulled open the pasted seals, took out the cloth bags, and stole all the U.S. dollars inside. He used the same method to open the second suitcase, stealing the U.S. dollars, leaving only a portion, totaling 1,640 U.S. dollars, in the suitcase. After finishing, he placed the suitcases back in Hu's bedroom. At 7:00 a.m. on the 23rd, he wrapped the stolen U.S. dollars in two packages of kraft paper and stored a small number in the safe. Later, he wrote a letter to his family, enclosing 250 U.S. dollars (in fifty-dollar bills), and sent it to his mother. At 10:00 a.m. on the 24th, because Cao Qiuting discovered that the suitcases were missing U.S. dollars, in order to avoid exposure, he disguised all the stolen U.S. dollars in packets of iodine pills and placed them in the cargo room, without hiding. He also vehemently denied that any accomplices were involved.

Still Missing Over One Hundred Dollars

According to the confession, the investigating officer escorted the suspect Zheng to the address to retrieve the stolen goods, totaling 36,925 U.S. dollars, plus the remaining 1,640 U.S. dollars in the suitcase, and the 250 U.S. dollars that had been remitted, for a total of 38,815 U.S. dollars. This was still 185 U.S. dollars short of the total of 39,000 U.S. dollars that had been stolen, which has not yet been found. Zheng Yuangui was charged with theft, along with the evidence of three cloth bags, and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. As for the retrieved 36,925 U.S. dollars, although the investigation revealed no suspicion of operating on the black market or evading gold, the police station, for the sake of caution, will send them to the Central Bank to be exchanged for gold yuan coupons and returned to the victim Hu Weizhi for collection.

### Child Fare Exemption Standards to Change on Two Railway Lines Next Month

The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration will change the method of exempting children from ticket fees on the railways, starting from the first of next month. According to a spokesperson from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, the Ministry of Communications' Road Administration Department believes that the current railway passenger transport regulations, which stipulate that children under the age of four are exempt from ticket fees and those between four and twelve years of age are charged half fare, should be changed to use school age as the standard. The average school age for children in China is six years old. Therefore, the revised regulations will exempt children under the age of six from ticket fees and charge half fare for those between six and twelve years of age. If there is doubt about the age, the height will be used as the determining factor. According to a survey by the Ministry of Health, the average height of a six-year-old child is 1.1 meters, and the average height of a twelve-year-old child is 1.4 meters. This will be used as the standard for determining height. The order to change this standard has been issued by the Ministry of Communications to all relevant agencies and has been decided to be implemented starting on the first of next month.

### Fangjian's First Retail Store; Rush to Buy Woolen Fabrics; Standing in Line Overnight for Over Ten Hours; Profiteers Rampant; Company Considering Identity Card Purchase System

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since Fangjian Company's first retail store on Maoming South Road began selling woolen fabrics and serge from the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau, the low prices have led to unprecedented crowds of citizens rushing to buy them. To maintain order, the company issues numbered tickets each day before sales begin, allowing customers to purchase one piece of material (six yards) in order according to the ticket number, limiting the supply to 600 people per day, with 200 tickets for government employees and 400 for ordinary citizens. To facilitate government employees, those with identification are given tickets first. It is understood that the congestion at the store has become increasingly serious. More than a thousand citizens line up each day to receive a ticket. Fearing being left out, some even start lining up at the entrance of Fangjian Company at 6:00 PM the day before, waiting for over twelve hours. After receiving a ticket at 10:00 AM the next day, they can then enter to purchase the material. Even in light rain, many bring umbrellas and bread with them. The degree of crowding is worse than the situation when buying rice in previous days. However, because of the potential profits, "scalpers" are rampant. It is rumored that these scalpers disrupt the lines of waiting citizens in the quiet hours before dawn, often pushing their way to the front and obtaining tickets first, while the citizens who have been standing in line all night are unable to buy the material.

At Least Six Months of Sales

A reporter visited Hu Songhan, the manager of the company, yesterday. According to Hu, the company has ample inventory in its warehouse. The current inventory is sufficient for at least six months. Therefore, citizens do not need to rush. However, the company is concerned that the emergence of "scalpers" will make it difficult for ordinary citizens to enjoy their rights and that all the benefits will go to the "scalpers." To prevent this, in addition to asking the Kan Jian Brigade to maintain order regularly, the company is now considering suggesting a thorough solution to the authorities: citizens must purchase material with their identity cards. When the purchase reaches a certain standard, a stamp will be added to the identity card, and they will not be allowed to buy it again this season. Manager Hu said that the company is still drafting the purchase standards and detailed procedures. If the above method is implemented, the "scalpers" will disappear, the interests of citizens can be equalized, and the congestion can be alleviated.

Convenient for Civil Servants; Sales Every Sunday

In order to facilitate the purchase by civil servants, the company is open for sales as usual on Sundays and closed on Mondays. Starting yesterday, Sundays will be reserved for civil servants only. Ordinary citizens can only purchase from Tuesdays to Saturdays. Due to the congestion, the company's employees handle over a hundred transactions each day, and the office hours exceed ten hours.

### Stealing Undersea Cables; Four Key Criminals Arrested

### Criminals are Cunning; Other Routes to Escape to Hong Kong; Traveler Registration Should be Implemented Nationwide; Garrison Headquarters Recommends Central Adoption

In order to prevent corrupt officials, illegal merchants, and political criminals from escaping to Hong Kong, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters was ordered to implement a traveler registration system for those going to Hong Kong. The Garrison Headquarters has been very strict in reviewing applications for travel to Hong Kong. However, merchants and criminals are exceptionally cunning. Since the traveler registration system is only implemented in Shanghai, they are taking routes through Guangzhou and then to Hong Kong. This situation occurs frequently. The Garrison Headquarters has reported this to the central government and recommends that traveler registration be implemented nationwide to prevent criminals from escaping justice.

### The Bandits on the Waters of Dinghai are Eliminated; Leader Wang Rongxuan Executed; Over 500 Captured Bandits Escorted to Shanghai

On the 10th of this month, Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing personally led a fleet to supervise the suppression of bandits in the Dinghai Zhoushan Islands. After two weeks, major results were achieved. The bandits in the area have been eliminated, and the waters around Dinghai, which had been blockaded since the 10th, have been reopened, facilitating fishermen and travelers. Gui successfully completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on the 25th aboard the flagship "Yongxing" and will travel to Nanjing today. It is understood that the bandits in the waters of Dinghai, Zhejiang, were led by Wang Rongxuan and Xu Xiaoyu, who colluded with each other to harass the local population, commit murder, and extort money. Wang and Xu even colluded with the Communist bandits and were appointed as fake "Zhoushan Islands Guerrilla Commanders," becoming quite rampant. Although the army, navy, and police stationed in Dinghai have repeatedly suppressed them, they have not been able to eliminate them due to the complex island geography and special environment of Dinghai. In order to prevent the spread of the bandit forces, Commander-in-Chief Gui led the "Zhonghai," "Zhongji," and other ships, as well as the Marine Corps, the Naval Police Battalion, and a portion of the Youth Army to suppress them on the 10th. The army and navy coordinated, searching each island and annihilating many bandits. They also captured bandit leader Wang Rongxuan and over 200 others. Bandit Wang was executed locally in Dinghai after being captured. The officers and soldiers of the Second Security Police Company of Dinghai, numbering over 300, were disarmed due to suspected collusion with the bandits, and were transported to Shanghai along with the captured bandits, totaling over 500, on the 25th by the "Zhonghai" and "Zhongji" ships. They are currently being interrogated by the military law office of the First Naval District Command. The Political Warfare Office of the Military District Command has scheduled a visit for reporters from local newspapers to view the captured bandits at 2:00 PM this afternoon.

Li Yuelin, Director of the Political Warfare Office of the First Naval District Command, stated that the report in the newspaper on the 26th that "Deputy Commander of the First Naval District Zhang Huifang personally commanded the suppression in Dinghai" was a misunderstanding. The headquarters of this military district does not have a deputy commander position. It may be that an illegal person is impersonating the position. The relevant authorities have ordered an investigation. According to reporters, Zhang Huifang was originally a pirate who operated in the area of Pudong and the Dinghai and Shengsi Islands. Most of the bandits suppressed this time were his former subordinates.

### Laurel Shop Assistant Murder Case; Two Culprits Convicted; Sentenced to 12 Years Each

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Yang Wenfu, a barber, and Li Baoqing, a pancake vendor, conspiring to murder Dai Shaonong, an assistant at the Dafeng Laurel Shop, was concluded by the District Court the other day. Yang Wenfu and Li Baoqing were jointly convicted of murder and sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment each, with ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Hao Zhouquan was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for harboring a criminal, which can be commuted to a fine of one yuan per day. Li Xuezhong was found not guilty. The murder weapon, a knife, was confiscated. Yang Wenfu originally operated a barbershop in a shed built against the wall to the right of the Dafeng Laurel Shop in Liujia Lane, and Li Baoqing set up a pancake stall next to him. In April of this year, when the Dafeng Shop was repairing its buildings, the two were discovered by the Public Works Bureau to have built illegal structures and by the Electricity Company to have illegally installed electricity meters. Yang and Li suspected that Dai Shaonong, an assistant at the Dafeng Shop, was behind it, so they harbored resentment and sought revenge against the shop. On May 26 of the same year, Yang and Li conspired to murder Dai. They pre-arranged a butcher knife and ambushed Dai at the entrance of Dasheng Lane, Minguo Road, at 6:00 AM on the 29th of the same month. When Dai approached alone, Yang grabbed his collar, and Li stabbed him in the left leg. Yang then murdered Dai, and they fled to the home of Hao Zhouquanzhen in Suzhou, who knew of their crime, for shelter. They then fled to Nanjing, where the police quickly arrested them and a suspect named Li Xuezhong, and transferred them to the court for trial. The sentence was pronounced as above.

### Rising Sun Building Sewage Ditch Project Needs Over 90,000 Yuan; Benefit Fee Apportionment Determined; Collected Separately According to Four Grades

The Municipal Government's Flood Prevention Committee, in order to carry out the sewage ditch project in the Rising Sun Building area on Nanjing East Road and Zhejiang Middle Road, invited shop residents and representatives from the four major companies Yong'an, Sincere, etc., including Guo Linshuang, Cai Huimin, Wang Qijun, and Liu Xiexun, the other day. They decided to collect benefit fees for the flood prevention project through an apportionment method. The method was well supported by the representatives, and it was decided to pay the fees within two weeks. The flood prevention project has been decided to bury a 33-inch diameter sewage ditch and add a pumping station. The starting point of the sewage ditch is Tianjin Road and Zhejiang Middle Road, along Tianjin Road through Guangxi Road, turning to Guizhou Road, Ningbo Road, Yunnan Road, Liuhe Road, Fenyang Road, and linking to the 4.5-foot diameter ditch on Tibet Middle Road, a total length of 858 meters. The pumping station on the Suzhou River on Tibet Road will be expanded. The entire project requires more than 97,000 Gold Yuan, and it is expected to be completed within six months. The principles for calculating the benefit fee are determined as follows: (1) The benefited area is divided into four zones according to the distance from the water accumulation area. The zones are divided into the first zone for direct beneficiaries, the second zone for the surrounding area, and so on outward to the third and fourth zones. The widths of each zone are approximately equal. (2) The total amount of benefit fees for each zone is calculated proportionally to the length of the facade and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the water accumulation area. (3) The benefit for each household is calculated according to the ratio of the financial bureau's valuation of the house. (4) The minimum benefit fee for each zone is 20 yuan for the first zone, 10 yuan for the second zone, 8 yuan for the third zone, and 6 yuan for the fourth zone.

### Concrete Plan to Solve Western Medicine Shortage to be Announced in Days

Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau, visited Nanjing to consult with relevant health authorities regarding the supply of medicines and the problem of diverting medicine sources in the city. He returned to Shanghai the other day. According to Director Zhang, a satisfactory solution has been obtained for the serious medicine shortage in the city. Due to practical difficulties, a concrete plan has been drafted after careful consultation and discussion and will be officially announced within days. The main points are as follows: (1) Since Shanghai is the commercial center of the country, the medicine shortage in Shanghai is enough to affect all parts of the country. In view of this, the central government has specially approved emergency imports of medicine in order to solve the medicine shortage during the transition period. (2) Before the medicines are shipped in, pharmacies in the city can apply to the Health Bureau for advance loans if they urgently need to sell medicines, and then return them after the medicine import quotas are determined. (3) During this period of medicine shortage, it is hoped that medical and pharmaceutical groups in the city will abide by government laws and regulations, maintain the market price of "August 19," and wait for the government to make reasonable adjustments. The Health Bureau is also providing the central government with actual information for reference. (4) In order to meet actual needs, the Health Bureau will form a joint conference with the city's transportation management authorities and medical and pharmaceutical groups in order to find a reasonable solution to the city's medicine shortage.

### Hoping Everyone Participates in Labor to Universally Raise Living Standards: Shui Xiangyun Discusses the Diligence and Frugality Movement

Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, recently expressed his views on the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement, stating that the movement is a further action based on the New Life Movement and the National Economic Construction Movement, and its essence is to reform society. He believes that all compatriots across the country have this need. Taking Shanghai society as an example, a life of luxury, waste, and decadence fills the city, and it is urgent to make progress. Therefore, the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement is actually a new moral movement to revive the country through "labor." Mr. Shui said that diligence and frugality should focus on cities. Currently, the consumption of urban people is disconnected from production. Therefore, frugality should first be implemented in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Beiping, and Tianjin, and then popularized throughout the country. At the same time, it must be from top to bottom, and more attention should be paid to whether officials, wealthy landlords, and rich classes are practicing it, because the affairs of the poor in our country are below the standard, and they have reached a level where there is nothing more to save. He also cited the United Kingdom as an example, where frugality is very thorough. From the royal family to the poor, everyone follows it uniformly. This kind of spirit of sharing joys and sorrows from top to bottom is truly admirable. The rationing system is also very equal, and everyone is treated equally, which we should emulate. Therefore, it is hoped that officials, wealthy landlords, and the rich class will no longer just shout slogans but should lead by example to promote the movement. Mr. Shui also put forward five concrete suggestions: (1) People should first save manpower. Whether it is an organization, company, or individual, they should save as much as possible. (2) Things should be simplified. Unnecessary socializing, meetings, and the circulation of some official documents should be reduced. Especially for weddings, funerals, and celebrations, there should be frugality. (3) Things should be used to their fullest. Whether it is an organization or factory, things should be used to their fullest, and waste should be saved. Luxury decorations should be discarded. (4) Time should be saved. At the same time, it is more important to respect time and seize the moment. (5) Land should be used to its fullest, and the slogan "Leave no land unused" should be put forward. Mr. Shui believes that during this period of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, we should save on the one hand and strive to produce on the other. Finally, Mr. Shui emphasized the true meaning of economic democratization and rationalized life. The government should encourage people from all walks of life to work equally to increase production. All workers should have food to eat, and parasites and those who gain without labor should be transformed to participate in labor. Then, the phenomenon of social inequality can be eliminated, and the living standards of our people can be universally raised.

Yimiao and Penglai Districts Promote the Diligence and Frugality Movement

The people of Yimiao and Penglai Districts in this city held a propaganda meeting for the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement at the Civil Women's High School in the Confucius Temple at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than a thousand representatives from all walks of life and the public attended. Shao Xinshi, Cao Zhiyuan, Xu Hongzao, Wu Xichai, and others presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement. Subsequently, Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters delivered a speech on behalf of Yi Muge. Finally, a telegram of respect to the President was passed. The original text reads: "Respectfully reading your recent instruction on the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement, it targets current abuses and offers critical advice, so as to lead the masses and seek the utmost for the nation. We listen attentively and are all inspired. This association solemnly held a propaganda meeting today and unanimously decided to support it, supervise all walks of life, and work hard to achieve it. We humbly submit our sincere feelings, hoping for your attention. Propaganda Meeting for the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement by All Circles in Penglai and Yimiao Districts of Shanghai, respectfully."

Weekly Economy

### General Commodity Prices: A Discussion on the Current Market Situation, with Improvement Needed in the Future

From August 23rd, after the promulgation of the New Economic Program on August 19th, the market transactions, up to the end of last week, have lasted exactly one month and three days. During this month or so, because Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo was responsible for supervising the implementation of the new program in Shanghai, the measures were serious and strict. Therefore, Shanghai achieved the best results, and transactions were able to abide by the law, and price limits always stood firm. It is said that the South China region sent people to Shanghai to study Mr. Chiang's "secrets of success."

While we are pleased with the success of price controls in Shanghai, we cannot help but make further explorations into the current market situation. Because Shanghai accounts for too much importance in the national economy, the authorities' control focus was also particularly focused on Shanghai after the implementation of this new program, believing that controlling Shanghai could effectively stabilize national prices. So far, Shanghai has managed to maintain the August 19th prices. However, the control situation in other areas is not ideal, forming a situation in which Shanghai's prices are isolated and relatively low. Therefore, even under strict laws and punishments, Shanghai's goods still have a restless intention to escape to other areas, this being the first point. Because of the relatively low prices in Shanghai, in the long run, the raw materials and local products from other areas will show a phenomenon of shrinking back from Shanghai, this being the second point. After the implementation of the new program, idle funds have not been effectively absorbed. It is estimated that the current idle funds accumulated in Shanghai are about 300 million yuan, which is a huge number far beyond the previous legal currency era. At the same time, the underground interest rate in Shanghai is as low as six percent, and short-term funds are not easy to borrow. It is said that the underground interest rate in various cities in the southwest is still as high as two cents or more, this being the third point. Combining the aforementioned factors, we feel that the price control in Shanghai urgently needs to recognize the crux of the problem. On top of the existing achievements, we need to turn in another direction to ensure the 100% success of the new program.

Commodity Prices Showing a Steady but Upward Trend

Due to the abundance and active flow of idle funds, the trend of the commodity market last week had a rising trend in prices. However, due to fear of the authorities' control, they did not dare to violate the price limits. However, there were many cases of prices rising to the limits, which are too numerous to mention.

In terms of cotton cloth, 42-count Blue Phoenix was seen on Monday and Tuesday with prices of 1050 yuan and 1060 yuan. There were no prices after Wednesday, but there were still many miscellaneous brands. About hundreds of pieces of 21-count Double Horse were traded on the market every day, with prices rising from 770 yuan on Monday to 783 yuan at the end of the week. Long-staple fine cloth was absorbed by individual brokers, once seeing 128 yuan and 5 jiao in the Three Associations. After the registration of inventory, people were nervous, and it fell back to 120 yuan and 7 jiao at the end of the week.

Because the prices of other commodities rose, and the arrival of food was relatively concerned, the prices were very firm. High-end goods were rarely seen on the market, and lower-quality goods rose to the price limit. White japonica rice on the North Market stood at 20 yuan and 9 jiao at the end of the week. The oil market was stable with a slight upward trend. Qingdao virgin oil stood at 59 yuan and 9 jiao on Thursday. Old brands of flour were not traded, and miscellaneous brands were available on the market, with prices standing at the price limit.

Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cigarettes showed mixed trends compared to last week, with ups and downs. Solid brand soap stood at 25 yuan and 6 jiao at the end of the week. Beautiful matches stood at 117 yuan. High-end cigarettes were still rarely seen, and most remained at the price limit.

New Measures Repeatedly Implemented by Economic Supervision

The new measures formulated last week under the auspices of the Economic Supervision Office included: (1) In order to understand the actual quantity of raw materials and necessities in the city's factories, the Supervision Office decided to start a general registration of materials in the city from the 25th to the 30th, and ordered all registration procedures to be completed within these five days. Registration method: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau will first distribute the registration forms to more than 300 trade associations in the city, and the trade associations will distribute them to various stores, firms, factories, and warehouses, which will fill in the actual numbers themselves. The form is divided into the name of the goods, unit, quantity, and monthly sales volume. It is limited to being submitted to the various trade associations before the 27th, and the trade associations will submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau on the 28th for transfer to the Supervision Office for verification.

The registration of necessities is limited to rice, noodles, flour, yarn, cloth, paper, edible oil, and industrial raw materials. It is also stipulated that after the investigation, the merchants must still sell at retail prices and supply the market. After the registration is completed, a comprehensive general inspection will be implemented, mobilizing 5,000 people, and starting next week, a general inspection of warehouses will be carried out. If unregistered goods and raw materials are found, they will be confiscated, and the owners will be severely punished according to law.

(2) In principle, foreign exchange is allowed for self-supply, and all imports are limited to industrial raw materials, necessities, and machinery.

(3) In principle, it is decided that if Shanghai's industrial products have a surplus, the surplus items may be transported to other areas, based on the principle of not affecting the city's prices. The transportation method is to obtain contact from trade associations in the producing and marketing areas to prevent forced sales, hoarding, manipulation, and other illegal behaviors. If violations of the above regulations are found, they will be severely punished.

(4) The deadline for the exchange of gold, silver, and US dollars is set for the end of this month and will not be extended. If it is found after the deadline, it will be severely punished according to law.

Improved Sales of State-Owned Stocks

Since the issuance of state-owned enterprise stocks, sales have been sluggish, and have become even more desolate last week. It is reported that the National Bank is seeking to open up sales and has decided on three methods: (1) The assets and liabilities of each unit of state-owned enterprises should be reported and printed separately as soon as possible for investors to choose.

(2) Guarantee the interests of investors and increase dividends. (3) Revise the dividend payment method to increase the interest of investors. In the past, interest was paid once a year, but now it is planned to pay interest every three months. (4) Increase the sales area and gradually spread it to major cities. The authorities have begun to study methods to restore the special auction of state-owned enterprise stocks on the stock exchange. In addition, Taiwan has also reached an agreement, and sales will begin soon. Hankou, Chongqing, and other places are also planning.

Short-Term Treasury Bonds Return to the Market

Short-term national bonds were re-issued in Shanghai by the Central Bank starting on Thursday. The bond denominations are divided into 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 5,000 yuan in gold yuan. They are issued at a discount on the face value with one month until maturity. The discount rate is calculated on a monthly interest rate of 1.5%. The discount is posted daily. The first day's quoted price was issued at 98.5. From the date of issuance to the end of last week, more than 30 million yuan was sold. At a time when idle funds are struggling to find a way out, the re-emergence of treasury bonds is timely. With a fixed term of only one month, they are not too long and meet market needs. Therefore, sales are promising.

### Currency and Finance: Abundance of Idle Funds Urgently Needs Guidance

In the financial market of this city last week, on the one hand, the supply of short-term funds was absolutely strong, but on the other hand, the demand for funds was extremely weak. As a result, the abundance of funds has presented an unprecedentedly serious situation. Since the currency reform, the source of idle funds in this city has always been more than the outflow, and the amount has become larger and larger. The authorities originally planned to sell shares of state-owned enterprises as one of the methods to divert idle funds, but in just a few days, the people's appetite seemed to have reached saturation early. The total amount sold was less than 1% of the original planned issuance. So, starting from Thursday last week, the authorities had to issue treasury bonds as a remedy, which was much better than selling shares of state-owned enterprises.

It is estimated that the total amount of idle funds accumulated in this city has reached about 400 million yuan. Among them, such as the continuous withdrawals of national banks in the past ten days or so, it will soon reach 30 million yuan. The outlet for idle funds must be guaranteed. Without a guarantee, idle funds can only stay in the bank and wait for an opportunity to move. But it can be asserted that idle funds will inevitably seek an outlet. If it does not go on a legitimate path related to production, then it will go on an illegitimate path unrelated to production. Temporary calm is not necessarily a good phenomenon, because after a while, perhaps the effect of the disturbance will be more intense, so preventing problems before they occur is really an urgent matter!

Accumulation of Short-Term Funds and Falling Underground Interest Rates

The underground interest rate in the market last week has always been hovering at a low level, generally between six and seven and a half percent. The lower limit has fallen below the six-cent six-cent interest rate quoted by the money shops before the Fifth District, which is also rarely seen before. Furthermore, the monthly interest rate on weekly deposits in some local banks and firms in this city has not only decreased to below three percent, but the banks and firms are no longer interested in this deposit. From this, it is not difficult to see the general accumulation of short-term funds in the market. But one phenomenon is quite noteworthy, that is, there is an eager demand in the market for longer-term loans of one month or three months, and the interest rate is as high as two cents or more. If there are no special reasons, it can be interpreted as an unstable response to the psychological state of the general public in the economic market.

Last week's brokerage interest was generally fixed at 2 yuan per day, and the monthly interest was only about six percent.

Increased Outflow of National Banks and Increased Inflow of Foreign Firms

Last week's clearing results of national banks showed continued large outflows for payments such as the purchase of materials. From Monday to the weekend, there were outflows every day, totaling 11,115,879 yuan, an increase of more than 1,759,000 yuan compared to the same period last week.

The clearing results of foreign banks showed a total inflow of 4,088,787 yuan from Monday to Friday, an increase of more than 1,852,100 yuan compared to the same period last week.

Commercial banks and firms have an exceptionally abundant supply of funds, and there are many long positions everywhere. Interbank lending has not been done at all. There is no outlet for idle funds. The depression of the financial industry can be said to be increasing day by day. Last week, the clearing results of the banks and firms after the 60th showed an overall inflow. From Monday to Friday, the total inflow reached a huge 4,820,000 yuan. After deducting the 80,000 yuan inflow of the Taiwan Bank in the past five days, the indirect clearing inflow of commercial banks and firms still reached more than 4,703,000 yuan, which gives a general view of the accumulation of short-term funds in the industry.

Domestic Exchange Rates Falling and Hong Kong Market Rising

Last week, the trend of domestic exchange rates in commercial banks continued to decline. The exchange rate for Guangzhou remained unchanged, at 24 yuan from Monday to Friday. The exchange rate for Xiamen decreased from 24 yuan at the end of the previous week to 20 yuan on Monday of last week and has not changed since. The exchange rate for Chongqing saw a decrease, from 20 yuan at the end of the previous week to 16 yuan on Monday of last week, then falling to 12 yuan on Tuesday, and then falling to a low level of 10 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Hankou also continued to fall, from 16 yuan on Monday to 12 yuan on Tuesday, and then falling to 10 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Tianjin was 10 yuan at the end of the previous week, and it fell and stabilized at the level of 5 yuan last week.

For foreign exchange rates, the price of Hong Kong gold was 296 yuan and 5 jiao per tael on Monday, and then it continued to rise, reaching 298 yuan 5 jiao 1 on Thursday. The price fell 2 cents on Tuesday, and then rose back to 5 yuan 1 jiao 8 cents on Wednesday and Thursday. The Hong Kong exchange rate remained stable, and the official exchange rate was the same as the previous week.

The wholesale price index classified by use for last week is as follows: The total wholesale price index for last week increased by 1.48% compared to the third week of August. The wholesale price index classified by the degree of processing for last week is as follows: August

The wholesale price index classified by country of origin and sales for last week is as follows:

### Opening of the Yi Police Basketball Game Produces an Upset: Songshan Loses to Lujiawan. Changshu Loses to Laozha After Fierce Battle.

As a result, the four teams directly under Zhenru, Gaoqiao, and Penglai in Group B won. Except for the fact that the ratio between the Directly-Affiliated team's victory over Huangpu was still close, the rest became one-sided. In the Group A game, Laozha faced Changshu, and the battle was particularly fierce. Changshu had overtaken twice and tied three times, but in the end, they lost to Laozha with a score of 37 to 56. The score in the first half was 21 to 23, only one point behind. In the final game, Songshan fought against Lujiawan. Songshan had famous players such as Bao Songyuan and Chen Xuechong, and it was thought that they would definitely win. Who knew that there would be an upset? Songshan was quite active at the beginning of the game. Although Lujiawan resisted strongly, they were behind all the way. In the first half, Songshan took the lead with a score of 19 to 16. After changing sides, the generals of Lujiawan suddenly became smooth, and there were many loopholes in the Songshan lineup. Lujiawan was able to come from behind and overwhelm Songshan with a score of 41 to 29. The opening game produced an upset, which is also said to be strange. The results of each game yesterday are recorded below:

Directly Affiliated Won Huangpu (Group B Yi) 20-11 Zhuyi Lai Won Changning (Group B Yong) 32-5

Zhenru Won Hongkou (Group B Yong) 45-6 Lao Zha Won Changshu (Group A) 56-37

Gaoqiao Won Yimiao (Group B Yi) 33-13 Lujiawan Won Songshan (Group A) 41-29

### What Vegetables to Buy?

— Zan Ying

In recent years, the vegetable markets have always been extremely profitable. As a result, the faces of the vegetable vendors have been consistently unpleasant. A single disagreement would elicit the response, "Don't buy it, then!"

Before the currency reform, they raised prices at will and "tailored the price to the person." New housewives suffered the most. Arguing with them was exhausting, and they would give you a hard time with sarcastic remarks. So, more experienced housewives and maids learned to "grab a handful while handing over a bunch and scoop up an extra before leaving." Only with extreme effort and resourcefulness could they cope.

Now, the situation has only worsened. One has to go to the market as early as six or seven in the morning, but it is already a sea of people. One has to force one's way into the crowd, find an opening, and use a loud voice to say, "Thank you, please give me a pound of meat!" However, the butchers, the "knife-wielders," often have hearing problems and ignore your loud calls. After repeated requests, they will give you a pound of "assorted meat," full of bones, thick skin, and fatty meat, with no option to choose. Otherwise, they will glare and curse at you, or, more politely, say, "Madam, you're lucky to get any meat at all! Humph! You want to pick and choose with price-controlled goods!"

Not only that, but the weight is also not up to you. Listen: "Half a pound is not sold, at least a pound. Do you want it or not?"

Tamed like lambs, you must allow them to weigh the meat, calculate the amount precisely, and submit the money, because the "knife-wielder" has already announced loudly, "Have your money ready, no change given!"

The most people buy meat, because vegetables are not much cheaper than meat, and adding oil makes them equivalent to the price of meat. But the butcher's fierce face and harsh tone are truly unbearable. However, their faces are two-sided. If you are willing to pay a "black market price" or buy in large quantities for a restaurant, they will greet you with a smile and say, "I'll deliver it to you later!"—This is the origin of the man-made meat shortage.

As for going to the market later, most of the meat stalls are already "empty in nine out of ten places." Half a pig's head and a strip of muscle remain lonely decorations on the market shelves. The fish buckets are filled with muddy water! Only a few piles of cat food remain on the fish board! Turning to buy eggs, you find only duck eggs. They say there's no profit in selling chicken eggs at the controlled price, and you can only get chicken eggs delivered to your door (of course, not at the controlled price), but they won't deliver a small amount. So, you silently pick a few duck eggs and put them in your basket, considering it a complete menu for the day.

In the past, if pork was unavailable, beef was still available. But these days, even beef is quickly sold out if you are late. The vegetable stalls also have many empty baskets. The controlled prices of various vegetables are not actually lower than the original prices, but there are fewer and fewer vegetables, with no room to pick and choose. Bean curd is made smaller and smaller. If you complain about the size, the answer is blunt: "Don't buy it, then!"

Buying vegetables! Buying vegetables! What vegetables to buy!

### Hometown

— Yan Zhi

We all know that pigeons can fly home from far away, but we don't know that wild deer are also unwilling to leave their native land.

Not long ago, a batch of Scottish deer was transported to distant New Zealand. Not long after arriving, several of them suddenly escaped, disappearing without a trace. A few days later, they were discovered in the turbulent ocean, bravely swimming towards their homeland. They were actually 13,000 miles from home, and had to cross the vast Pacific and Atlantic Oceans!

### Advertisement

— Yuan Yi

With the development of commerce, the advertising industry must also develop. In the past, poets lamented the excessive advertising in this era, fearing that it would corrupt people's hearts. However, this "trend" actually began when Watt invented the steam engine.

Advertising, like everything else, is constantly evolving. We are amazed by the dazzling aerial advertisements in the bustling cities of America, but I believe that the advertisements in American newspapers and magazines are particularly noteworthy because the fundamental principles of their handling differ greatly from those of the past. In this respect, there may be something to learn from.

First, American advertisements are reducing broad and vague "tall tales" and paying more attention to the substance of the goods themselves. While they still focus on "hiding the bad and promoting the good," they are gradually reducing the "making something out of nothing" component. For example, advertisements for daily necessities often have a small oval stamp that reads, "Guaranteed by the 'Household Affairs' magazine. If the advertisement is inaccurate, a refund or exchange is guaranteed." This undoubtedly attracts many customers who are tired of "tall tale" advertisements. Advertisements for certain medical devices often have a shield-shaped mark that reads, "Approved by the American Medical Association Physical Therapy Association." This, of course, also enhances the confidence of patients. There are so many advertisements for Chinese patent medicines in our country. I think the latter is particularly worth emulating.

Second, the production of advertisements themselves has greatly improved. They pay attention to the specific readership of each publication, striving to suit their tastes, so that the overall style of the publication is not adversely affected by poor advertising copy.

Third, more pictures and fewer words. This is also a kind of progress. Sometimes, when there are more words than pictures, it is often to introduce a piece of common knowledge that everyone does not dislike in a relaxed and witty tone (such as insurance company advertisements talking about the signs of high blood pressure and the prevention of strokes, telephone companies explaining how to make a phone call, etc.).

The United States also uses advertisements to recruit soldiers, and their production is extremely sophisticated, showing the government's emphasis on this. Advertising merchants in our country have made considerable progress in recent years, but if they want to keep up with the times, it seems that they should continue to work hard.

### Reading Chen Xiaocui's Poetry Drafts

— Qiu Peiran

The Six Harmonies Xuan praises myriad things as false,
The poetry teachings of Central Plains are also slightly faded.
One spark of Du Ling throughout the ages,
Is entrusted to a female commoner from Jiangnan.

### Touring Sun Moon Lake's Hanbi Building

— Hu Yunyi

The lake clouds embrace tree shadows dimly,
Autumn wings chirp brightly on one side of the water.
A sense of floating life gradually increases,
Who will share the vicissitudes of life by the lake?

Sparse rain divides the twilight to the emerald hills,
The heart lake is ten miles of water and cloud encompassing.
Wanting to indulge in the lonely taste of the deserted night,
The sun and moon dwell together in the hundred-foot lake.

### "Contacting the Dead" in America

— Yan Bo

There is a "spiritualist" named Pike in Chicago, USA, who is famous for being good at "contacting the dead." His door is always crowded, and business is booming. One day, a woman with red, tear-filled eyes came, wearing a newly bought mourning dress, and asked Pike to help her, so that she could talk to her recently deceased husband.

Pike closed his eyes, moaned for a long time, and said, "I see a man. Yes, he is your husband. He says he is very happy, but he can't bear to leave you. He is leaving. He tells you not to be sad, and says that if you miss him, just come here to contact the dead. I'm sorry, the fee for contacting the dead is one dollar."

The woman began to cry. She sobbed and said, "How could he have already left? I still have things to say! What should be done with the three thousand dollars he left behind?"

The "spiritualist's" facial expression immediately became tense. "Let me try to find him again, don't worry."

He closed his eyes again, intoxicated for a while, and said, "I have found your husband again. He says that this money is for you to do business. He tells you to invest in—"

He seemed to be in great pain, and the muscles on his face twitched convulsively. He said:

"Your husband tells you to invest in a Wilcox Transportation Company at 1159 Meimu Street. He says that this company is prosperous and that if you deposit one thousand dollars this year, you can earn more than five thousand dollars within two years."

The woman's tears flowed again. She said gratefully, "Mr. Pike, I don't know how to repay you."

There was indeed a certain Wilcox at 1159 Meimu Street. He had already learned from Pike that he would receive a good business deal, so when the female customer arrived, he cheerfully did everything he could to entertain her, and the female customer followed Wilcox's words and started a transportation business.

However, Pike and Wilcox's joy turned to sorrow. Suddenly, the female customer accused them of colluding to defraud her, and the evidence was conclusive. The two men had no way to deny it and had to go to jail—

This female customer's real name is Rose McGunnegle. She was never married. Where did she get a recently deceased husband! For twenty years, Miss McGunnegle has specialized in fighting against those swindlers who live off the dead ancestors. She said that in the major cities of New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, the money sent to these swindlers each year is at least more than one million dollars, and if the whole country is considered, then the annual cost in this area is probably more than one hundred million dollars.

She has always cooperated with the courts or the police. She often disguises herself as a farmer, a maid, a wealthy lady, especially a widow, because she says that widows are the easiest to be "fooled by those" swindlers.

Once, the wife of a wealthy man invited Miss McGunnegle to visit. It turned out that the man was extremely superstitious and believed very much in the words of a "spiritualist." The "spiritualist" said that his financial fortune was very good and told him to bet on "number five" on the roulette table, and he would definitely win big. The wealthy man was overjoyed and immediately followed his instructions! As a result, he lost eight thousand dollars!

But the wealthy man still deeply believed in the "spiritualist" and went to find him again. At that time, McGunnegle brought an assistant and had already arrived, but did not come forward.

The wealthy man brought another three thousand dollars to the casino, but McGunnegle had already overheard the "spiritualist" making a phone call to the casino boss! Moreover, she recorded the conversation between these two people!

McGunnegle and the wealthy man's wife found the wealthy man in the lounge of the casino and played the recording for him to hear. But listening to the "spiritualist" said: "This guy is not suspicious at all. It is amazing that he can even do business! I think he is simply like a child, who doesn't understand anything, maybe even dumber than a child!"

The wealthy man was ashamed and angry, his face flushed red, and admitted that he had been deceived, but he absolutely refused to accuse the two swindlers. He exclaimed: "What! Am I supposed to go to court to hear them play this recording? Wouldn't that make me the laughingstock of the whole city!"

No true and honest ghost has ever said to those who "contact the dead," "Be careful, McGunnegle is here to make trouble." Therefore, McGunnegle has not yet encountered failure.

### Odds and Ends

— Xian Si

Hollywood's red female star Marlene Dietrich still has a reputation for beauty today, turning countless audiences upside down, but in fact she is already a grandmother! Her beauty is ageless, comparable to our Dr. Mei Lanfang.

There are many people in the United States who have the same last name and first name. Recently, the Veterans Administration sorted out the list of veterans after World War II and found 225,000 people with the last name Smith, including 12,000 people named John Smith and another 12,000 people named William Smith. In addition, 9,000 people are named William Brown. When Shanghai previously conducted a census, dozens of Wu Guozhen were found (recently, one was sentenced to life imprisonment). Compared with these Smiths and Browns, it is quite a small comparison to a large one.

On Mount Thunderhead in South Dakota, USA, work has recently begun on carving an unparalleled large stone statue. This is a memorial statue of the Native American Indian "Chief Crazy Horse," reaching a height of four hundred feet.

### Literature and People

— Wu Yong

Reading does not necessarily have to focus on what it says or what its subject matter is. What is important is to look at its spirit and charm, observe its style, examine its methods of learning, and emulate its spirit of diligence. Content and subject matter refer to things and objects, which are dead. Spirit, charm, method, and spirit refer to the person who wrote the article, which is alive.

A truly knowledgeable and eloquent person's writing has the force of overturning mountains and seas, with sights too numerous to behold, making people admire it and stand in awe, lamenting their own inferiority, and thus feeling a sense of "looking up to a high mountain and following a noble path." The same topic, written by another person, may not be so impressive. The reason why most people read a book is only because the author is a famous writer, and few read it because they feel that the topic or book title is interesting.

For example, Hu Shi on textual research, Chen Yinke on classics and history, Wang Guowei on Song and Yuan opera, Lin Yutang on Su Dongpo's biography. I personally do not feel any interest in these topics, but reading them turns out to be full of interest, and I am reluctant to put them down. This is because I am moved by the author, because I love his spirit and charm and admire his method and spirit.

In fact, any truly knowledgeable and eloquent person, even if writing on a topic that is incomprehensible to the general public, can still make them understand it and develop a strong interest in it. The reason why he can make people understand and develop an interest is also because of his spirit, charm, method, and spirit, not because of the content of the work or the topic.
