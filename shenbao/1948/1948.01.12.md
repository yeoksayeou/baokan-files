### Chairman Returns to Capital from Shenyang; Presides Over High-Ranking Generals Conference in Shenyang; National Army's Offensive in Western Liaoning Alters War Situation

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Chairman Chiang's special plane returned to the capital from Shenyang at 5:40 PM on the eleventh. Deputy Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, Liu Fei, and Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs of the National Government, Yu Jishi, returned together. Yesterday's report that Du Yuming followed the Chairman by plane was inaccurate.

[Our Beiping Office, 11th] According to someone arriving from Changchun today: Chairman Chiang flew to Changchun yesterday. Chen Cheng did not go to the airport to welcome him due to illness. That night, he convened a conference of high-ranking generals such as Chen and Wei. Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming did not accompany him.

[Our Beiping Office, 11th] Fu Zuoyi flew back to Beiping from Jinzhou at 3:00 PM on the eleventh. He had met with the Chairman several times in Jinzhou.

[Our Shenyang Office, 11th] Following the National Army's brilliant victory in the large-scale annihilation battles on both sides of the Liao River within the past three days, bandit remnants in the western Shenyang area are still gathering three or four columns, attempting to intrude again. Therefore, the fate of the bandits is still difficult to determine within the week. However, it is generally believed that the war in northwestern Shenyang has opened a new chapter.

[Our Shen Office, 11th] After the National Army's large-scale advance towards the west bank of the Liao River, the war situation has changed. The bandit forces in Dahushan on the northern Jinzhou Line have been cleared.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Thirty thousand bandits in southwestern Henan, led by Chen Geng himself, launched a fierce attack on Dengxian on the evening of the tenth. The defending local militia bravely fought back with vastly inferior forces, repeatedly charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat in the northern and western suburbs of the city over the past two days, inflicting heavy losses on the attacking bandits.

After a brave counterattack by the local militia, the bandits were finally repelled. Another powerful unit of the National Army has been rushing to their aid from a certain location, and it is expected that the bandits attacking Dengxian will be completely defeated by us in the short term.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, Eleventh] A large-scale annihilation battle is currently underway in western Henan, as the two thousand or so troops of Liu Bocheng stationed between Xinye and Dengxian in the Bai River valley are about to be completely annihilated by the National Army prepositioned on the highlands on both sides of the river.

A portion of them have even infiltrated into Tanbu (northeast of Mengyin), Antiqing (west of Juxian), and Meishi (south of Juxian) in the Yimeng Mountain area, never forgetting their attempt to rebuild their old base in the Yimeng Mountain area. However, since the construction in the mountain area was thoroughly destroyed by the National Army long ago, this move by the Communist bandits only reveals their futile efforts.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 11th] The independent brigade and the new 8th, 9th, and 14th Regiments of bandits attacking the suburbs of Dongping were annihilated by the National Army on the tenth, losing two battalions, and the remaining bandits fled west towards Anshan Town.

### Clearing Out Scattered Bandits in South China; Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in Five Provinces to Be Established Within the Month; Chairmen of Jiangxi and Fujian to Confer in Guangzhou

He recently held secret talks with Guo Siyuan, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression on the borders of Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan, who recently came to Guangzhou, to discuss methods for clearing out bandits on the Guangdong-Hunan border. It is reported that the Guangzhou Xingyuan has decided to establish a headquarters for bandit suppression in the border areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian within the month, with Ye Zhao designated as the Commander-in-Chief. Guo Siyuan has been consulted to be the deputy, but Guo has not yet made a decision.

[Another dispatch] It is reported that the Guangzhou Xingyuan has been ordered to expand its authority, with Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi and Guangzhou City all included in its jurisdiction, and all military powers and affairs are under the supervision and command of the Guangzhou Xingyuan. It is also reported that Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji, in order to coordinate the military deployment for bandit suppression between Jiangxi and Guangdong, has decided to come to Guangzhou in the middle of the month to meet with Director Song Ziwen to discuss the joint suppression of bandits in the border areas of the two provinces. Fujian Chairman Liu Jianxu may also come to Guangzhou in the middle of the month.

[Our Guilin Office, 11th] Border defenses along the Hunan-Guangxi border have been actively strengthened. Chen En-yuan, the Commissioner of the Eighth District, has already gone to Daoxian and Yongming on the Hunan border to inspect and deploy, and will immediately launch suppression operations.

[Our Changsha Office, 11th] The Yuehan Railway has recently been re-equipped with one armored train, and armed railway police officers dispatched by the Police Department are equipped with machine guns to patrol the Shaozhou-Guangzhou section.

### We Have the Right to Dispatch Customs Personnel to Be Permanently Stationed at Hong Kong Customs Office to Prevent Smuggling Between Hong Kong and Kowloon as Stipulated in Agreement

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that the agreement between China and Britain on the prevention of smuggling between Hong Kong and Kowloon will be established on the twelfth, but there is no signing ceremony, as the matters involved in this agreement are local and specialized, and there is no need for a formal agreement to be signed. The measures to prevent smuggling between Hong Kong and Kowloon have been agreed upon after repeated negotiations between the two parties, and the treaty will be constituted by the exchange of letters on the twelfth. According to what reporters have learned, according to this exchange of letters, it is stipulated that we have no obligations, but have the right to dispatch customs personnel to be permanently stationed at the Hong Kong Customs Office to handle the inspection of imports and exports and anti-smuggling together with Hong Kong personnel. The British side's agreement to our proposed plan and granting us this right is a purely friendly act without any exchange conditions; this is because smuggling between Hong Kong and Kowloon not only harms our country's interests but also provides no benefit to Hong Kong, and undermines the regulations and credibility of Hong Kong Customs. When Hong Kong Governor Grantham came to Beijing last year, he publicly stated that he was willing to assist in prevention. Now that the agreement is about to be established, the British side acknowledges its treaty obligations, and this cooperation will definitely be more active and achieve greater results. It is said that after the exchange of letters on the twelfth, the main points or the full text will be announced.

### Pei Tsu-yi to Fly to the U.S. the Day After Tomorrow; Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Beijing to Meet with the Financial Community

[Report from our newspaper] Pei Tsu-yi, a member of our technical advisory group to the United States, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 8:00 AM yesterday with his entourage. Lu Dingzhong, secretary of the National Bank, and others went to the station to greet him. Pei told reporters: "I have decided to fly to the United States on the fourteenth. The members of the entourage have already been announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and there have been no changes. I have just returned to China from Hong Kong and am somewhat out of touch with the domestic situation. What I know is not as much as you do. Moreover, I am responsible for a mission abroad, and I really have nothing to report at present. I will have to wait until I return to China before I can express my opinions. The information I have collected from various sources is quite rich, but it has been rumored that I am carrying a proposal to reform the currency system to the United States. I cannot confirm this. Only the government can answer that. It is difficult to predict at this time whether U.S. aid may exceed $300 million. From our country's standpoint, of course, the more the better. As for whether the technical advisory group will inquire about U.S. military aid to China, please ask Minister Yu to answer that."

After Pei arrived in Shanghai, many friends from the Bank of China visited him. During his two-day stay in Shanghai, he is scheduled to meet with Chen Guangfu, Li Ming, and other important figures in the financial community, and will also meet with other people from all walks of life as needed to gather ideas and benefit from different perspectives. Pei and his group of three or four people will fly directly to the United States on the fourteenth on a China National Aviation Corporation's "Skymaster" jumbo jet. Chen Changtong, manager of the Bank of China's foreign department, was originally scheduled to go with him, but he has now decided to postpone his departure for a few days due to business. (The picture shows Pei Tsu-yi (with a circle) arriving in Shanghai and posing for a photo at the station. Photo by our newspaper.)

[United Press, Nanjing, Eleventh] Personnel from the National Economic Council told our reporters that adopting a new currency system supplemented by a huge reserve is the only effective way to solve China's economic chaos, but said that implementing currency reform this spring is somewhat wishful thinking. China will not take any action in this regard until it receives a solid guarantee of assistance from the United States.

### Army Training Conference to Be Convened Soon in Nanjing; Sun Liren Flies to Beijing from Taiwan to Attend

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] General Sun Liren, Commander-in-Chief of Army Training, flew to Beijing from Taiwan at approximately 2:00 PM on the eleventh.

A comprehensive review and future improvements will be made regarding the training techniques and guidelines for our new recruits. Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to this, so he may personally preside over it. The attendees will be the Minister of National Defense, the Chief of Staff, the Deputy Chief of Staff, and the heads of the responsible departments. However, Bai Chongxi and Chen Cheng will not be able to attend. In addition, before Sun left Taiwan, he ordered the preparation of various relevant materials, all of which have been brought to Beijing to be presented for the conference report and study. Sun's Chief of Staff, Tang Shouzhi, is scheduled to come to Beijing from Taiwan on the twelfth. It is reported that since the Training Headquarters moved to Taiwan, it has begun training work, which is divided into three parts: new recruit training, cadre training, and special forces training, all of which are proceeding very smoothly.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] The new military academy was originally scheduled to begin enrolling students this year, but due to insufficient preparation, it was reported to the Ministry of National Defense that the enrollment period be extended by one year and changed to start next year. This has been approved. The Navy Headquarters originally decided not to recruit new naval students because the new military academy would be established this year.

### Shao Lizi's Remarks in Shanghai; Luo Longji's Movements Not Restricted

[Report from our newspaper] Shao Lizi came to Shanghai by train from Beijing yesterday morning to attend the funeral of Ye Chucang in Suzhou. Reporters greeted him at the station.

Regarding the rumor that the government will establish a semi-official and semi-private institution to accommodate National Assembly representatives affected by the method of nominating candidates by political parties, he said, "I have not heard of it." When asked about the activities of members of the Democratic League after its dissolution overseas, Shao declined, but said that Luo Longji is currently recuperating in a hospital in this city and his freedom of movement has not been restricted.

### Quota for Imports to South China Increased, Accounting for 22 Percent of the National Total

All Guangzhou newspapers sent reporters.

[Our Jiyang Office, 11th] When news of the Kowloon incident came, the public here was indignant.

### We Should Resolutely Demand Compensation for Losses from Demolished Houses; Gan Jiehou Discusses the Kowloon City Incident

[Our Beiping Office, 11th] The diplomat Gan Jiehou, former Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs in the Southwest, who handled the Kowloon City incident in 1938, recently spoke about this matter, saying that our government should resolutely demand that the Hong Kong government compensate for the losses from the demolition of houses. If the Hong Kong government's occupation of Kowloon City is for military needs, then Britain may follow the precedent of the British allowing the United States to use its territory as a military base during the Great War, and consult with us in a friendly manner. It is absolutely impermissible to take unilateral coercive action. If the Hong Kong side uses the excuse that Kowloon City residents do not pay attention to hygiene, then we can accept their intention and rectify it. Gan also recounted the history of the Kowloon dispute, and refuted the Hong Kong side's interference with the residents of Kowloon City based on the 1898 Sino-British "Convention Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory". Public opinion organizations here have also exchanged views on the Kowloon incident for days, and will express their views when necessary.

### Notice on Adjusting Prices for Eight Public Utilities; Executive Yuan Issued for Implementation in Provinces and Cities

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] The National Economic Council believes that prices fluctuate from time to time, and the costs of public utilities inevitably rise and fall accordingly.

It was also decided to implement them from January 1948 and use them as the basis for adjusting public utility prices in various places. The responsible authorities have added implementation guidelines to the standards for review, and sent them to the Executive Yuan for issuance to relevant ministries and commissions and provincial and municipal governments for implementation.

Those Legislative Yuan who have signed and had their names substituted under the provisions of a party member, even if an announcement has been made, should be revoked.

### Defeat Defeatism!

Last year, after General Wedemeyer came to China to conduct an inspection, he issued a statement before his departure, criticizing Chinese intellectuals for being full of defeatism. This was a harsh statement, but it was also a truly invaluable piece of advice.

Indeed, our intellectual circles are filled with defeatism. This doesn't refer to all intellectuals, but at least a portion of them are filled with pessimistic sentiments. Because they hold onto defeatism, they only care about themselves, only care about the present, only know how to complain, only know how to vent grievances, and are unwilling to think about the long-term future of the nation and the people. It's not just some intellectuals who are like this; many people with high expectations in society also inevitably harbor vague defeatist sentiments. Some officials, given the opportunity, immediately become corrupt, even if there are strict punishments to rein them in. Some industrialists who could be productive are unwilling to actively produce, but are secretly planning speculative profiteering. Merchants are unwilling to endure hardships to engage in trade, but are moved by short-term gains and only use opportunities to engage in hoarding and speculation. People in education and culture often flaunt "detachment" and "neutrality," escaping reality, making high-sounding pronouncements, only seeking to deceive themselves and others. Some self-proclaimed authorities in public opinion also dare not point out where the violence threatening the nation and the people is, who the real culprits endangering world peace are, but instead chant vague "anti-civil war," "anti-feudalism," "democracy," "progress," and other empty slogans. Intellectual youths are even more restless, unable to clearly recognize their great responsibilities to the future world and their own country, only knowing how to express dissatisfaction with the status quo, as if no one in the entire country is good except for them, and nothing is pleasing to the eye, so that once stimulated, they immediately provoke student movements, seemingly willing to overthrow everything for the sake of pleasure. And even more unworthy ones, as "seeds of learning" still in school, do not know to "be the first to worry about the world's troubles and the last to enjoy its pleasures," but indulge in the world of wine and women, reveling in singing and dancing. These various states of麻醉(anesthesia), complacency, decline, escape, as well as impulsiveness and decadence, all without exception prove that defeatism is at work.

Naturally, among intellectuals, there are many strong individuals who face reality, persevere in struggle, make continuous efforts, and are indomitable, working hard and diligently for the country and the people, but unfortunately they are overshadowed by the prevailing atmosphere of defeatism in society and are not easily recognized by superficial observers.

However, in this atmosphere of defeatism, our workers and our farmers are still silently struggling arduously, just like the soldiers on the front lines fighting to the death with the Communist bandits who harm the country and the people. In safe areas, workers are constantly working, and farmers are constantly cultivating to supply the military and civilians with clothing, food, and supplies. In bandit suppression areas, today the railway is destroyed, and tomorrow it is repaired and reopened; today the mines and factories are destroyed, and tomorrow they are repaired and put back into production. The vast countryside is harassed, plundered, slaughtered, and coerced by the Communist bandits, but when the bandits come, the farmers fight bravely, and after the bandits leave, they rebuild their old homes on the ruins and actively cultivate. They are truly engaged in the struggle of "construction against destruction" and "survival against death." Those in the front fall, and those in the back stand up. They have never been conquered by defeatism. This is the spirit of the Chinese nation and an example for those intellectuals full of pessimistic sentiments.

Indeed, many intellectuals are now dispirited, depressed, or indignant and resentful of the world, but we believe that their spirit will eventually rise again. In the process of the Chinese revolution over the past fifty or sixty years, in the process of building a new China, the history of intellectuals' efforts has been glorious, standing in the leading position of the revolutionary movement and nation-building work. From the Xinhai Revolution to the Northern Expedition, to the eight-year War of Resistance, and even all construction undertakings, intellectuals have always stood on the front lines. Especially the tragic history of the War of Resistance, we have personally experienced it and our memories are still fresh. On the eve of the War of Resistance, the passionate and indignant spirit of intellectuals, ready to go, and in the process of the War of Resistance, the tenacious and steadfast, calm and struggling emotions of intellectuals, were all the most sacred and great expressions of human spirit. This expression is enough to guarantee that the Chinese nation can resist foreign aggression in the past, can fight against war and chaos today, and can exist forever in the world.

Now, we are facing the era between the "September 18th Incident" and the "July 7th Incident" again. The covetous gaze of external forces is heavier and more cunning than that of Japan. The Communist bandits' activities of creating internal turmoil and selling out the motherland are unfolding universally and deeply in military, economic, and other aspects, and even creating fallacies that deny that national and national interests are above all else to confuse people's minds. In the past, the traitors' evil theory of "East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere" was not enough to deceive us, but instead aroused our indignation, but today, the Communist bandits' fallacies, like poison coated with sugar, deceive naive youths. This is where the real crisis lies! However, among the educators on whom the future destiny of our nation and people depends, some "scholars" believe that they are only responsible for peddling knowledge, turning a blind eye to these phenomena, and using the banner of catering to the trend of freedom and preserving the reputation of academic cliques as their purpose, and will not stop until they harm the youth and bury the country. It must be known that at this critical moment of national and popular destiny, we can only do our best to combat defeatism, clear up pessimistic sentiments, revive our spirit, face our reality squarely, stand up our shoulders, align our steps, fight against the harsh environment, and work hard for the construction of a new China based on the Three People's Principles, in order to save our nation and people from the fate of destruction!

We firmly believe that darkness is temporary, and light will surely come. After the severe winter, spring will surely arrive. Life is short, but the life of the nation will be passed on forever. We should not be tormented by darkness, but should move forward to a bright future with enthusiasm. Look, with President Chiang's old age, he still has to undertake more than eighteen hours of work every day, traveling back and forth, with no time to rest. Doesn't this active spirit inspire us?

The President instructed us on New Year's Day: We should use three years to quell the banditry and stabilize society. Let us revive the spirit of the eve of our War of Resistance, combat all defeatism, eliminate all corrupt and evil forces, to welcome this firm declaration, and fulfill our due responsibilities!

### Notes on Utility Pricing

(Continued from page 1) The adjustment of prices for eight public utilities, including electricity, tap water, gas, telephone, tram, small train, bus, and ferry, in various regions will be based on the calculation formulas determined by this committee from January 1948. Public utilities in various regions should submit their income and expenditure accounts and cost calculations for the past year to the local competent authorities for thorough investigation and verification, and should continue to report them on a monthly basis. Whether the price determination is appropriate depends entirely on whether the various bases and total coefficients in the formula are reasonable. The verification procedures for the bases and total coefficients are as follows: A. Each public utility calculates its various bases based on its expenses for the past year and reports them to the local competent authority. B. Each public utility calculates the total amount of various taxes, dues, and profits that should be paid, as well as the percentage of this amount to the total production cost, calculates one time the total coefficient, verifies it, and reports it to the local competent authority. C. The local competent authority carefully reviews the obtained information, and if there are any exaggerations, it should be corrected to ensure accuracy, and after proper formulation, it should be submitted to the central competent authority for verification. The fuel prices used in the formula are based on the prices set by the Fuel Management Committee (but transportation costs may be added), the exchange rate is based on the market price announced by the Balance Fund Committee, and the cost of living index and the price index of hardware materials are based on the figures announced by the local government. Regarding the repair and maintenance costs in the formula, the ratio of the part that should be included in the foreign exchange or hardware material costs and the part of the cost of living index should be related to old debts, depreciation, and loan interest, which should be added to the price amortization in several months. The amount and months must first be reviewed by the local competent authority and reported to the central competent authority for approval. When public utility prices must be adjusted, the proposed price adjustment should be repeatedly requested to be verified by the local competent authority and forwarded to the central competent authority for record, but at most once a month, and the adjustment should begin at the beginning of the month. Those who sell tickets or charge fees may adjust them from the first day of the month. The local competent authority should examine the actual local needs at the time of the price calculated according to the formula and may increase or decrease it appropriately, but the increase or decrease rate is limited to 10%. If local public utilities believe that the implementation of the calculation formula is obstructed, they may report the difficulties in detail to the local competent authority and forward them to the central competent authority and this committee for revision. The calculation formulas all have explanations for each item for easy application. Unless otherwise stipulated in the explanations, these notes shall be followed.

### Inspection of Opium and Drug Trafficking Joint Measures Planned by Ministry of Interior and Submitted for Implementation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] In order to prevent the inflow of opium and drugs from Communist bandit areas and remote areas, and to prevent the entry of foreign opium and drugs, the Ministry of Interior has consulted with the Ministry of National Defense and relevant agencies and believes that it is necessary to implement strict inspections. Therefore, it has drafted the "Contact Measures for Local Governments and Military Police to Inspect Opium and Drugs in Various Provinces, Cities, and Counties" and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for circulation to various provinces and cities for implementation. The measures are as follows: All unified inspection agencies for various land and water transportation have been ordered to be abolished. Opium and drug inspection belongs to the general scope of social inspection. The principle is not to set up special agencies. Opium and drug inspection offices or similar agencies that have been set up in various provinces and cities should be abolished. However, in remote provinces or places bordering neighboring countries that are transit distribution centers for opium and drugs, if there are indeed special circumstances and it is necessary to set up special interception agencies, the provincial and municipal governments may draft measures and report them to the Ministry of Interior in conjunction with the Ministry of National Defense for verification and forwarding to the Executive Yuan for approval to set up opium and drug inspection offices or checkpoints. Local police and garrison troops should be invited to send personnel to participate, and they should be abolished when the original special circumstances disappear. At major traffic arteries or important cities and towns, where military police perform security checks or general inspections, the local anti-opium agencies may, if they deem it necessary, designate police officers to participate in the inspections. When military vehicles, ships, aircraft, or other transportation vehicles pass through, if the local anti-opium agency has prior reliable clues about opium and drug trafficking or discovers suspicious signs, and there is no organization that regularly performs security tasks or general inspections in the area, it should jointly conduct temporary inspections with the highest security agency and the local military police to ensure strictness. At ordinary times, the local anti-opium investigation agencies should investigate and inspect suspicious items and remote paths for drug trafficking in various ways according to their responsibilities to avoid omissions.

### Shen Xirui Talks About Taiwan's Economy, Coordination Between Various Business Institutions Can Avoid Any Crisis

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] Shen Xirui, director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, believes that the economic problems facing the province are not as serious as rumored. If coordination can be achieved between the various business institutions in Taiwan Province, any crisis can be avoided. Shen, who has been in Taiwan for ten days, made a statement after a detailed investigation and research, saying, "The province is not blessed by nature." Various industries are completely based on artificial forces. Over the past two years, the government has sent specialized talents and allocated huge amounts of funds. Various industries have gradually been able to restore their original production capacity. In the future, if coordination can be achieved between the various business institutions in Taiwan Province, whether in terms of management or financial resources, if they can help each other, then the various difficult problems that are currently facing can be solved by themselves. For the remaining difficult points, the Central Government can be asked for assistance. He also said that the province has now shifted from focusing on trade to focusing on production, which is very important and very correct. Regarding the supply and demand of materials in Taiwan Province, those that were matched with Japan in the past must be matched with our country in the future. Shen was ordered by Zhang Jiaao to investigate the economic situation in the province. He has been very busy discussing matters these days. On the evening of the 10th, he met with Chairman Wei Daoming again, and on the 11th, he rushed back to Shanghai to meet with Bei Zuyi.

### Key Points of the Draft Implementation Measures for the Economic Program's Water Conservancy Sector

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The draft implementation measures for the economic reform program's water conservancy sector have also been drafted by relevant agencies. The key points are recorded as follows:

Based on the relevant provisions of the economic reform program and the implementation measures of the water conservancy construction outline, and in response to objective environmental needs, the main objectives of water conservancy construction are the following five, with plans to implement them in five-year phases, prioritizing them based on urgency and importance.

1. Concerning the fundamental treatment of major rivers:

For major rivers with existing fundamental treatment plans, funds should be allocated from the national treasury or foreign investment should be utilized to begin implementation immediately. For those without complete fundamental treatment plans, efforts should be accelerated to complete them within a set timeframe.

Implementation methods: 1. Focus on the fundamental management of major rivers nationwide to eliminate water disasters and revitalize water conservancy. 2. The fundamental treatment plans for major rivers should be based on various data, considering "control," "universalization," "dredging," "excavation," and embankment and river management methods in detail through careful surveys, planning, comparisons, and calculations. 3. The greatest objective of Yellow River management is flood prevention and irrigation, supplemented by hydropower development and navigation channel improvement; the fundamental treatment plan should be actively completed within a set timeframe. 4. The fundamental treatment plan for the Yangtze River should focus on shipping and hydropower, while also considering flood regulation and irrigation utilization; the plan should be completed as soon as possible; important tributaries should be planned and implemented accordingly. 5. The Huai River should first complete the Huai River diversion and flood prevention project, while also developing shipping and irrigation projects. 6. The fundamental treatment plan for the Yongding River should be implemented immediately. 7. The fundamental treatment plans for other major rivers should be formulated and implemented according to their respective urgency and importance.

2. Concerning irrigation development:

Approximately 250 million mu of arable land nationwide is suitable for developing or improving irrigation systems. In the past, the government was limited by funds, and agricultural loans were limited, making large-scale implementation impossible. In the future, in addition to agricultural products, water conservancy bonds should be approved for issuance or other methods should be explored based on the needs of each province to increase funding and facilitate progress. Implementation methods: (A) The state allocates funds for projects. 1. The government should find ways to improve existing large-scale irrigation projects and actively allocate funds to develop new irrigation projects, paying particular attention to the northwestern provinces. The first five-year phase will focus on irrigation projects in the Yellow River region, including the eight provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Henan, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Qinghai, with an irrigation area of 9.97 million mu; the inland sea region, including Hexi in Gansu and Xinjiang, with a total of 3.6 million mu; the Bai River region, including the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and Chahar, with a total of 3.35 million mu; the Huai River region, including the three provinces of Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu, with a total of 4.11 million mu; the Yangtze River and Lancang River regions, including the ten provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, with a total of 16.07 million mu; the Liao River region, including the two provinces of Liaoning and Jehol, with a total of 660,000 mu; the Songhua River region, Jilin, with 780,000 mu; totaling 38.54 million mu. 1.5 million mu can be completed ahead of schedule in the first year. 2. The funds needed for irrigation projects in the first year will be allocated by the government from the farmland water conservancy fund for reserve; after the completion of the project, water fees will be collected from the benefited farmland in installments to repay the principal and interest for cyclical use. 3. The audit standards for irrigation projects are based on the principles of complete plans, superior benefits, convenient construction conditions, and completion within three years. 4. Project construction is carried out in two ways: by the central competent authority and by local governments. 5. After the completion of the project, the local government is responsible for management and maintenance. 6. For projects completed with the fund, the provincial government will be responsible for collecting consumption the following year. The water fees collected, in addition to being used for management and maintenance, will be used to repay the central government's project funds first, and the remainder will be used as local farmland water conservancy funds. (B) Agricultural loans are used to carry out projects. 1. Nonghang should increase agricultural water conservancy loans in areas urgently in need of irrigation construction in the 37th year and use cooperative societies in various provinces and counties to promote well and pond loans universally. 2. Projects that have not been completed in various provinces should be accelerated and completed within a set timeframe; those that have been completed should be properly managed and maintained. The principal and interest should be repaid starting the year after the completion of the project. 3. The loan procedures should be simplified as much as possible, and the use of the loan should be supervised. 4. Reduce the current loan interest rate to enable various provinces to universally carry out irrigation projects. 5. After the loan, each province should quickly establish a sound construction organization and complete the project on schedule according to the plan. (C) Supervise local governments to carry out irrigation projects. 1. Local governments may apply for the issuance of water conservancy bonds as local farmland water conservancy funds, and the local government shall set up a fund management committee. 2. Supervise the governments of various provinces and counties to use slack farming seasons to launch voluntary labor to universally construct irrigation canals and well-digging pond projects and carry out work competitions. 3. For larger irrigation projects that people cannot build on their own, they can apply for small farmland water conservancy loans and the local government will assist in the process. 4. Set up water conservancy engineering teams in important irrigation areas to assist and guide the people in building on their own and provide appropriate loans. 5. In the arid areas of Northwest, Northeast, and North China, focus on well projects, and in the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins, focus on pond digging and pumping irrigation and drainage projects. 6. For completed projects, supervise and guide the beneficiary farmers to form water conservancy associations for management and maintenance.

3. Concerning river management and protection:

Although flood prevention focuses on the fundamental management of various rivers, the symptomatic methods should also be given special attention to protect farmland, people's lives, and production.

Implementation methods: 1. Pay attention to the management and protection of various rivers to prevent floods. 2. The competent authorities should pay attention to guarding and strictly prevent breaches, and local officials should organize the masses to prepare materials locally and be responsible for participating in the work. 3. The dikes damaged during the war and those that have not been repaired should be repaired to reach one meter above the highest flood level. 4. The culverts and sluices damaged during the war should be repaired immediately, and those that have not been built should be built as soon as possible. 5. The silted rivers and waterways blocked during the war should be dredged quickly. 6. The following projects should be completed in the first five-year phase: rebuild or repair the dikes of the lower Yellow River; complete the dike projects of the Huai River, Yangtze River, Han River, and North China rivers; complete the dike and sluice projects of the lower Pearl River and Han River; repair the dike projects of the main and tributary streams of the Liao River.

4. Concerning waterway management:

Most of China's major rivers flow from west to east and are rarely interconnected. More north-south canals should be opened to create a network of waterways; inland river ports should be used as strongholds, seaports should be used as hubs between land and sea, and transportation between the north and south rivers and seas should be convenient. Implementation methods: 1. Focus on waterway management, the opening of canals and harbors, and seek to connect water and land transportation. 2. When managing waterways, priority should be given to trunk lines with important economic value for transportation or those that can be combined with other water conservancy construction. 3. Priority should be given to opening canals that connect two adjacent river systems. 4. When opening harbors, they should be coordinated with the water and land transportation network, and priority should be given to harbor projects at the intersection of water and land. 5. Waterways and harbors damaged during the war should be completed as soon as possible, and the navigation depth should be maintained at its necessary scale as a minimum. 6. The waterways that have been managed during the war should be continued and managed and maintained separately. 7. The following projects should be carried out in the first five-year phase: manage waterways and new canals, including the Songliao, Liaohe, Jinshi, Yingkou, Jinbao, and Huangwei canals, and the Yellow River, Wei River, Grand Canal, Huai River, Wei River, Min River, Jialing River, Han River, Xiang River, Gui River, Gan River, Wen River, Qu River, and Xun River, a total of approximately 7,800 kilometers, so that ships of 300 to 1,000 tons can navigate. The inland river ports to be built include Hanyang, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Xinxiang, Baotou, Ningxia, Tongguan, Xi'an, Zhenjiang, and the Longhai Railway Canal Station, but 31 locations including Weiyin, Bengbu, Zhengyangguan, Xinpu, Chenjiagang, Yichang, Chongqing, Luxian, Yibin, Leshan, Guangyuan, Xiangyang, Laohekou, Nanzheng, Guilin, Hukou, Nanchang, Ganxian, Nanping, Wuzhou, and Nanling should be completed first. In terms of seaports, the southern major ports, Shanghai, Qinzhou, Yingkou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Xiamen, Xingao Port, Shantou, Dianbai, Dadongjing, Qinhuangdao, Longkou, Yanwei, Lyutian Port, Shipu, Funing, Mawei, and Yulin, totaling 19 locations, should be expanded.

5. Concerning water resources development:

Although China is rich in hydropower reserves, it is still in its infancy. The existing 750,000 kilowatts of hydropower are mostly in the Northeast and Taiwan. In the future, development should be coordinated with the needs of agriculture and industry, and appropriate locations should be selected.

Implementation methods: 1. Hydropower development should be coordinated with flood prevention, harbor, waterway, and irrigation projects of various rivers. 2. When selecting factory sites, priority should be given to the needs of industry. 3. In the first five-year phase, the southwestern provinces will be prioritized for development, with a focus on the Xianggui area. 4. For the Northeast hydropower industry, the initial goal is to restore the power generation capacity when it was under enemy control. 5. In addition to those that should be restored immediately, the projects in Taiwan's hydropower industry that have not been completed should also be reviewed for necessity and selected for resumption of work. 6. The Yongli undertakings in other regions should be developed separately depending on the needs of the situation, with varying degrees of urgency and importance. 7. Private hydropower enterprises should be rewarded and assisted. 8. 748,000 kilowatts of hydropower will be developed in various regions in the first five-year phase.

### U.S. Fiscal Budget for 1949: Truman Submits to Congress; Totaling $40 Billion, Including Aid to Europe and Loans to China; Taft Expresses Desire to Reduce It

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Congressional Republicans rejected President Truman's tax increase plan on the 10th in order to attack the draft budget to be presented on the 12th. According to informed sources, Truman is requesting $40 billion in appropriations for government expenses for the year beginning July 1. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber stated, "This number is too high" and should be reduced. Senate Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft stated that the Republicans will make every effort to reduce government spending. He said, "Expenditures, including the Marshall Plan, must be 'absolutely necessary.'"

[United Press, Washington, 11th] The U.S. fiscal year 1948 will end on June 30 of this year. President Truman submitted a total budget of $39,668,993,983 for the fiscal year 1949 to Congress on the 11th. Truman requested Congress to appropriate $1.27 billion for government expenses and relief expenditures in occupied areas. This exceeds this year's budget by $310 million. The main reason for the increase in expenditure is due to the cost of the U.S. in the American occupied zone of Germany. The budget submitted by the President includes $748,679,482 for the purchase of grains and agricultural products. Truman allocated $112,373,529 to purchase agricultural supplies and fertilizers, and $90,760,993 to purchase petroleum and petroleum products. Truman stated that the United States must have huge expenditures abroad to prevent the "expansion of totalitarian rule." The budget includes $9 billion for worldwide aid programs, including $6.8 billion for the first 15 months of the Marshall Four-Year Plan, and includes $1.25 billion in relief funds for the U.S. Army in occupied countries, and $750 million to aid "several countries under other international aid programs, including China," $71 million for the International Refugee Organization, and $132 million for Philippine rehabilitation and wartime losses. A year ago, Truman stated that large-scale foreign aid undertakings were "mostly over." At that time, he only requested $250,000 to aid a small number of countries. This budget proposal contrasts sharply with Truman's words and deeds at that time. Truman said on the 11th: "The new international plan is our response to the unprecedented challenge. If the international plan fails, totalitarian rule will expand further. At that time, we will re-examine our security plan. Under pressure, we will take all necessary measures. If Europe once succumbs to totalitarian rule, then the United States will increase its military strength, and its expenditure will be even greater than the international aid plan currently submitted to Congress." Truman promised to submit to Congress a "positive recommendation" for a new foreign aid plan including China in the short term. In this respect, the budget exceeds the Marshall Plan by $750,000. It is estimated that China can receive approximately $300 million. Although Truman did not mention the names of other countries, it is generally believed that Korea can receive $75 million.

### Widespread Implementation of the Marshall Plan: Tensions Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union Increase; U.S. Administrative Authorities Publicly Acknowledge

[United Press, Washington, 10th] U.S. authorities admitted on the 10th that the Marshall Plan added fuel to the already tense relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, but the authorities firmly opposed Congress's opinion that the plan was too expensive. U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas, who was also "selling" the Marshall Plan in Congress, was questioned by the bipartisan members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for three hours. He firmly supported the opinion of the administrative authorities, that is, that a European economy built with U.S. aid can achieve "lasting peace." Douglas only admitted that the United States' determination to implement this extensive recovery plan will inevitably cause the Soviet Union to launch a new propaganda offensive. The administrative authorities plan to allocate $6.8 billion in the first 15 months and a total of $17 billion in four years.

### Countries Receiving U.S. Aid: The U.S. Will Send Cooperation Officials; Douglas Announced in the Senate

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] U.S. Ambassador to London Douglas reiterated his views to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is examining the Marshall European Recovery Program, on the 10th. When answering questions from Democratic Senator George, he stated that trade between the United States and European countries under the Marshall Plan should be conducted through private, non-governmental channels as much as possible. He also stated that the United States will send one "Economic Cooperation Official" to the embassy of each of the 16 countries receiving assistance. Those sent to larger countries will be ministerial-level officials, and those sent to smaller countries will be counselor-level officials. The State Department plans to send 900 officials dedicated to implementing the Marshall Plan, of which 400 will be stationed abroad and 500 will remain in the country. Douglas also specifically pointed out that resistance to communism west of the Iron Curtain has increased due to the imminent availability of U.S. aid.

According to State Department spokesman Douglas's statement to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, the relief and recovery aspects of the aid to Europe plan are almost inseparable, but he promised to provide this report within the next week.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] The U.S. State Department ordered a ban on the export of war surplus radar on the 10th because Republican Congressman Ross protested that some radar had been imported into the Soviet Union. National Armaments Control Bureau Executive Secretary Kim Minns stated that radar will now be classified as military equipment and will not be allowed to be exported without a special permit. This move means that radar used in the war may not be exported to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries in the future. Palestine is also a country to which arms are banned.

### Britain Concludes Regional Military Alliances with Arab Countries Separately; Renegotiation of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty Has Been Completed

[Reuters, London, 10th] Britain's compliance with Middle Eastern public opinion and its engagement in treaty amendment negotiations with Iraq, Transjordan, and Egypt have attracted Moscow's attention. The TASS correspondent in Cairo recently stated that Britain's goal is to conclude a regional military alliance with the Arab countries, but the instructions received in London are that the almost simultaneous holding of these treaty amendment negotiations is only a coincidence in time and has no other function.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Britain and Iraq have agreed to conclude a new alliance treaty to replace the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. The draft treaty was signed by Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr and British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the Foreign Office in London today. Formal signing procedures will be held next week, and then its contents will be announced.

According to informed sources, Britain has made significant concessions to Iraq in the new treaty, including the abolition of the rights stipulated in the original treaty for Britain to station troops at the Habbaniyah and Shaiba airfields in Iraq during peacetime, enjoy extraterritorial jurisdiction, and other conveniences. In the future, control of these two airfields will be transferred to Iraq, but Britain will still be allowed to use these two airfields until other suitable landing sites are available. The provisions of the new treaty will be fully discussed in Parliament after the British Lower House reconvenes on the 20th of this month. The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 stipulated the end of British mandate in Iraq and recognized Iraq's independence. The renegotiation talks began on Wednesday of this week, and the discussion focused on the fifth clause of the treaty. This clause, in addition to stating that the King of Iraq acknowledges that defending the United Kingdom's lines of communication is beneficial to the United Kingdom and Iraq itself, also allows Britain to use the above-mentioned two airfields and station troops in these two locations. The negotiations also involved the military appendix to the 1930 treaty, which stipulated that British troops in Iraq would enjoy certain privileges, including tax exemption and convenience of action and training. The military appendix also stipulated that Britain would sell military supplies and equipment to the Iraqi government and provide the Iraqi army with training facilities. The basic provision of the 1930 treaty is that the signatory countries shall not conclude treaties against each other and shall provide mutual assistance and convenience in the event of war. Except for the Royal Air Force units stationed at the Habbaniyah and Shaiba airfields and the British military delegation stationed in Baghdad, there are no other British troops in Iraq. The last batch of British troops stationed in Iraq due to the war withdrew in October last year. After the Anglo-Iraqi treaty amendment negotiations, a delegation from Transjordan is also scheduled to come to Britain this month to negotiate amendments to the Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 1946. Observers also expect the British government to make a positive attempt to break the stalemate in the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations.

### Following Prime Minister Attlee, Morrison Denounces the Soviet Union: Atrocities of Violence and Destruction of Democracy Are Unforgivable

[Reuters, London, 11th] British Deputy Prime Minister Morrison delivered the first important speech on British policy toward the Soviet Union by a key member of the British cabinet since the new year at the Labor Party conference here today, severely criticizing the false and malicious attacks on Britain by the Soviet Communist Party and the willingness of communist parties around the world to become outposts of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Morrison said that the Soviet Communist Party is adopting a new form of imperialism, threatening the welfare and way of life of other European countries. He said: "Our greatest wish is to cooperate with the Soviet Union to maintain peace and promote the welfare of mankind, but we cannot forever turn a blind eye to the false and malicious attacks on us by the Soviet Communist propaganda machine and the willingness of communist parties around the world to become automatic outposts of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One after another, countries in Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe have been placed under undemocratic and unrepresentative governments, while other political parties have been severely oppressed, freedom of the press has been frequently destroyed, and non-communist political leaders have been illegally executed. We are not only deeply saddened by this destruction of people's livelihood and human freedom, but also cannot help but feel indignant. What is even more painful is that these false and violent methods are actually advertised as democracy, freedom, and socialism.

Bevin and Massigli's meeting was originally scheduled for noon on the 10th, but it was rescheduled to last night to facilitate this morning's meeting with the Iraqi delegation.

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] A French embassy spokesman said that French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, will lodge an oral protest with the State Department next Monday regarding the establishment of a new economic regime in the British and American zones of Germany. It is expected that Bonnet will inform the State Department that the French government believes that Britain and the United States should not make independent decisions on the establishment of a West German government before France, Britain, and the United States discuss the possibility of merging the three occupation zones of Germany in Berlin. Diplomatic circles here are deeply concerned that France's protest will delay the Berlin negotiations and undermine their hopes for success.

[United Press, Berlin, 11th] The Soviet official newspaper here reported on the 11th that the Soviet Union plans to force the United States and Britain to withdraw from Berlin. It is claimed that the United States and Britain's plan to establish a separate West German government violates the Allied control authority.

[Reuters, London, 10th] The committee of the International Socialist Conference began its first meeting in London on the 10th. Representatives from nineteen socialist parties attended. British Labour Party Secretary-General Philip was elected chairman.

[Reuters, London, 10th] The British Labour Party will invite socialist parties participating in the Marshall Plan for European Recovery, including representatives from Germany and Austria, to a conference.

As a result, the Socialist International Committee rejected the French and Belgian proposal by a vote of eleven to five. The Socialist parties of Britain and the Scandinavian countries joined the Eastern European countries in voting against it.

The International Socialist Conference has completed all of its work today, so it will no longer hold meetings on Sunday. Resolutions passed at the meeting included scheduling a plenary session of the Socialist International Congress in Vienna from June 4th to 6th, and establishing a subcommittee to supervise the finances and administration of the Socialist Information and Liaison Bureau, consisting of representatives from Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. Observers attach great importance to the British Labour Party's invitation to Western European socialist representatives to hold a conference, believing that the talks have significant implications for the British government's European policy and the future cooperation of the International Socialist Conference. The Labour Party must have obtained the consent of the British government before initiating this event.

### The Socialist Party is in a Difficult Situation; Katayama Cabinet Will Collapse

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Due to recent political developments, Tets Katayama's Socialist Democratic Party is facing a severe situation. Katayama's coalition cabinet appears likely to collapse by the end of this month. Katayama told a Central News Agency reporter alone that the situation within the party is extremely bad due to Rikizo Hirano's departure from the party. At the same time, the number of right-wing members of the Socialist Democratic Party has decreased since the departure of the Hirano faction, and the right-wing's control within the party has also weakened, further empowering the party's left wing. The key to the current political interregnum in Japan is the attitude of the Central Purge Committee towards the Hirano case.

### Police Department Investigation Team Leader's Embezzlement Case: Qi Zaiyu and Others Transferred to Military Law Department

Numerous offenses have been revealed, with at least two cases already exposed. Commander Xuan has telegraphed Chairman Chiang to request instructions on handling the matter.

[Central News Agency Dispatch] Qi Zaiyu, the Sixth Investigation Team Leader of the Songhu Garrison Command Investigation Department, is suspected of extortion, embezzlement, and fraud. After being reported by victims to Commander Tie Wu Xuan, Commander Xuan sent personnel to investigate and verify the facts. On the 5th, he ordered Qi Zaiyu to be brought to the Investigation Department and detained. Jin Runsheng (also known as "Gold Hunchback," Qi's powerful assistant) and seven other accomplices involved in the Qi case were arrested by Inspector Lu Peng on the 5th. After a detailed interrogation, the group of offenders was transferred to the Military Law Department for trial on the 10th.

Qi Zaiyu was known for his intelligence and competence in the Sixth Team, handling or co-handling various cases, and was highly valued by his superiors. Commander Xuan was enraged by the incident and did not show any leniency, a forceful move to rectify discipline. According to a reporter, Qi committed numerous offenses, and multiple crimes have been exposed this time. Two cases have already been revealed: On December 16th of last year, he extorted 455 million yuan from Wu Baokang, the owner of the Baokang Wireless Electric Material Shop in this city, using this money as the year-end bonus for some personnel of the Sixth Team. Qi himself received 60 million yuan. Jin Runsheng, his assistant, facilitated the extortion. Qi secretly reported to the Investigation Department that Wu Baokang had more than a hundred military telephones of unknown origin, requesting that Baokang be summoned for questioning. After the extortion was successful, he reported that the previous secret report was not true. This was reported to Commander Xuan by Wu Baokang as a victim. A Japanese man named Yokoi was a driver for the Hirai Group of the former Japanese Fourth Division (numbered "Noboru Unit") and was responsible for purchasing automobile materials. After the war, he was retained in Shanghai. Introduced by someone to Qi's driver, Qi employed Yokoi and extorted large sums of money from Japanese expatriates in Shanghai.

### Stall Vendors Along the Two Railways Petition: Bureau Agrees to Consider

[Our Newspaper] In view of the fact that stall vendors along the railway lines sell unsanitary food, which is detrimental to the health of passengers, and that the stall vendors are not properly dressed and poorly managed, which detracts from the appearance of the stations, the Railway Bureau has decided to ban them and take over the business itself. It has decided to add station restaurants at the four major stations of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang to provide food and drinks to passengers.

### Shen Bao Launches Readers' Student Aid Fund Again

Dear Readers: If you are not forgetful, I think you will definitely remember the "Readers' Student Aid Fund" held by this newspaper four months ago. Time flies, and the winter vacation is approaching again. Facing us is a more urgent and serious problem: the problem of rescuing out-of-school youth. Objective conditions clearly show us that this movement still needs to continue. Due to the continuous rise in prices, every citizen feels economic panic, and students are no exception.

Young students are the future pillars of society and the country, and they need people's assistance everywhere. However, in this difficult situation, although most people feel that making a living is difficult, on the other hand, we clearly see that there are countless wealthy people who are still living extravagant lives. The money they spend every day is enough for a college student's entire year's expenses. We have decided to start today to once again solicit donations from our readers for the "Student Aid Fund" in order to rescue countless out-of-school youth when the next semester begins.

We hope that enthusiastic readers will provide more assistance to poor students. For example, when you encounter celebratory gatherings, you may wish to think about saving money from frugality and donating it to the student aid fund. In particular, "collective donations" from various industries and businesses are the most welcome, as they are easy to achieve with the participation of the community. In short, those with strength should contribute strength, and those with money should contribute money. The effects are the same. —(Please send donations to the Social Service Section of this newspaper)

### Solicitation of Donations Begins Today

### Two Airlines Send Urgent Telegrams to the Ministry of Transportation: Requesting Effective Control of Oil Prices

It is learned that three gasoline companies raised aviation gasoline prices by 10% on the 1st of this month, and yesterday notified China and Central Companies that they would raise them again by 22% starting yesterday. Since the beginning of the year, air ticket prices have not been adjusted, but the price of aviation fuel has risen twice within ten days, causing considerable strain on the airlines. (Airlines currently have to pay 35% of their revenue for fuel) In particular, the unlimited timing and quantity of price increases leave airlines with no way to prepare. Yesterday, both companies sent urgent telegrams to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation and President Zhang of the Central Bank, requesting that effective control measures be taken as soon as possible. Otherwise, airfares will be stimulated by rising fuel prices and will have to be adjusted at any time. As a result, general prices will be affected, and the cycle will continue, affecting the national economy, with unimaginable consequences.

### Fake Refugees Are Heartless: Infiltrating Chao Hui Mountain Villa and Other Places, Embezzling Clothing for Self-Enrichment

[Our Newspaper] It has recently been discovered among the refugees in this city that local ruffians and thugs have infiltrated the group. These people rely on their special labor and take advantage of the fact that genuine refugees who have fled to Shanghai from other places are unfamiliar with the area and are easy to deceive. They claim to be representatives of the refugees and monopolize all relief matters, embezzling money and goods distributed by the government and donated by the public, causing serious impact on the benefits received by genuine refugees. These people are exploiting genuine refugees who are on the brink of death for their own enrichment, and their behavior is extremely despicable. It is now learned that the authorities have paid attention to this and have ordered a secret investigation. A few days ago, several fake refugees who had embezzled clothing were arrested in refugee settlements such as Chao Hui Mountain Villa and will be sent to judicial organs for severe punishment.

[Our Newspaper] The election of legislative committee members in this city is approaching, and the various legislative committee candidates are now beginning to conduct public speeches, publishing political views, and engaging in various competitions. The situation is gradually becoming heated and tense, and various groups are also expressing their support for their endorsed candidates. The information obtained is summarized below:

Qian Jianqiu

Qian Jianqiu, a Kuomintang-nominated legislative committee candidate (pictured), graduated from Northwestern University in Chicago, USA, and was the first Chinese woman to earn a Doctor of Laws degree in the United States. After returning to China, she practiced law in this city and also served as a professor at various universities in her spare time. When the War of Resistance broke out, she took on important positions in the city's Anti-Enemy Support Association, traveling around and inspiring the people, and her contributions were particularly great. After Shanghai fell into enemy hands, in a dangerous environment, she resolutely took on underground work and fought against the enemy puppets. She published the China Women's Monthly, advocating that women be loyal to the country, which had a significant effect. Two years ago, the National Government elected her as a representative to the National Assembly, and she is currently a member of the Central Women's Movement Committee and the Director of the Municipal Women's Movement Committee.

Wang Xinheng

Wang Xinheng, a regional candidate for the Legislative Committee in this city, the current legislator, and the government advisor, went to Zhabei District yesterday afternoon and gave a campaign speech on the topic of "The Relationship Between the Constitution and the People" to hundreds of district party headquarters cadres and security personnel at the Central National Elementary School. Wang explained the importance of the Constitution and the people, moving the audience. Wang made many contributions to Shanghai's anti-traitor work and public security after the victory, and the people of Shanghai have benefited from his efforts, so they unanimously expressed their support for Wang as a legislator.

Xie Renzhao

Xie Renzhao, the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters, will give a campaign speech at the Hubei Grand Theater in Zhabei at 9:00 AM tomorrow, entitled "Why I am Running for Legislative Committee Member."

Cao Jun

Cao Jun, the Deputy Chairman of the Kuomintang Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and a candidate for the Legislative Committee in this city, will attend the Wusong Expanded Memorial Week at Wusong Middle School today and give a campaign speech.

Fang Zhichao

Shi Yongji, Chen Zhenxi, Pan Zuyong, Xu Xuewu, Xu Rongzao, Fang Shanshu, and others, alumni of Zhijiang University in Shanghai, gathered the day before yesterday to support Fang Zhichao, who once served as a professor, in running for the Legislative Committee. They resolved to mobilize classmates to support him unanimously and scheduled a dinner party at 6:00 PM on the 15th at the Righteous Police Club at No. 11 Shaoxing Road. All Zhijiang University students or former faculty and staff are welcome to participate, and there will be no charge for the meal.

### Winter Relief Donations Received Nearly 20 Billion

According to the Winter Relief Committee Fundraising Committee, since the launch of the fundraising campaign, donations received have reached more than 19.144495 billion yuan. The above donations have been successively delivered to the Winter Relief Committee for overall planning, distribution, and utilization. The donations from the Western film charity screenings and the sugar industry are still being solicited. In addition, the donations from the issuance of charity housing lottery tickets are expected to far exceed the achievements of general fundraising, so the disaster relief funds for winter refugees in this city have all been secured.

### Adjustment of Civil Servant Salaries: City Government Employee Salaries Increase by 70 Million

The city government's budget for this year has been completely revised by the city's accounting office, with a total amount of over 1.3 trillion yuan. According to Finance Bureau Director Tian Yongqian, speaking to reporters, starting this month, after the central government approved adjustments to civil servant salaries, the expenditure for city government employee salaries, which was originally 60 billion yuan per month, is estimated to increase by 70 billion yuan based on the rumored civil servant index of over 80,000 times after the adjustment. The total monthly expenditure for salaries alone will be 130 billion yuan. Therefore, the expenditure for employee salaries alone this year will require over 1.6 trillion yuan, exceeding the city government's revised budget this time, which will inevitably require a supplementary budget.

### Melancholy Music and Solemn Rituals: Ye Chucang's Coffin Transported to Gusu; Burial Set for Tomorrow at Lingyan Mountain Cemetery

The late Kuomintang Committee Member and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Mr. Ye Chucang, passed away in Shanghai two years ago. His coffin was temporarily placed in the China Funeral Home. Now, his family has decided to transport it to Suzhou yesterday morning at 12:20 PM via the 78th local train. It is scheduled to be kept in Suzhou for two days, and the burial will take place on the 12th at the southern foot of Lingyan Mountain. The Ye Chucang Funeral Committee held a public memorial service at the China Funeral Home at 9:00 AM on the 11th, with Mr. Wu Zhihui presiding over the service, and Wu Zhongxin, Fang Zhi, Wu Guozhen, and others as co-officiants.

The procession was simple and solemn, expressing deep sorrow. In the center of the mourning hall hung a large white cloth banner inscribed by Chairman Chiang, which read "Glory to the Nation, Enduring Merit." On the sides were elegiac couplets from Mayor Wu, which read: "Verbal attacks and written condemnations, establishing courage and incorruptibility, long-standing reputation throughout the Southeast, spirit transforming rivers and mountains, surpassing all others. A great man descends, assisting the country, influence reaching the universe, glory illuminating the ages."

Reading of the Eulogy

At precisely 9:00 AM, the simple and solemn memorial ceremony began amidst the mournful music played by the police band. The officiating priest, Wu Zhihui, dressed in a blue robe and black jacket, offered flowers, incense, and sacrifices. Then, the master of ceremonies read the eulogy and the entombment inscription. The eulogy read: "On this eleventh day of January, in the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China, the Central Executive (Supervisory) Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang specially appoints Committee Member Wu Jingheng, along with Committee Member Wu Zhongxin, Committee Member Fang Zhi, Committee Member Wu Guozhen, and Committee Member Pan Gongzhan, to offer incense, flowers, millet, and wine to the spirit of the late Committee Member Ye Chucang. You were born in Suzhou, blessed with the essence of nature, answering the call of destiny, a wise and virtuous man was born. In your early years, you showed talent, in your youth, you aspired to correct wrongs and support the endangered. You served the country with your writings, entertained with poetry and wine. Your actions set an example, your knowledge was profound. Your clear voice encouraged, your words carried weight. You supported righteousness and established principles. You condemned Yuan Shikai and protected the Constitution, you wrote and attacked, you exhausted your efforts for the country. You governed in the Wu region, bringing joy to the people. Your memory is cherished, your virtue is deeply admired. You repeatedly held important Party positions, overseeing propaganda multiple times, expounding orthodox principles, revealing the true meaning. You experienced Party and government affairs, soaring throughout the world. Your extraordinary achievements, your great virtue were modest and unassuming. You presided over major plans, assisting in the revival of the nation, your achievements shine throughout the universe, your reputation is highly regarded. A virtuous man, the foundation of the nation, heaven is unfair, why did you leave us? The Party loses a pioneer, the country mourns a great man, all regions grieve, the stars dim. War is not yet over, the nation's progress is still difficult. Your spirit transforms rivers and mountains. Your noble character remains, your great spirit endures. May your spirit be aware and accept this offering." The entombment inscription read: "Mr. Chucang passed away in Shanghai two years ago. The members of the funeral committee have respectfully prepared a burial site at the southern foot of Lingyan Mountain. The construction is complete, and all have agreed. On this eleventh day of January, in the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China, we respectfully move you to your final resting place. The day is auspicious, everything is prepared. Those who are in charge of the ceremony are respectful and solemn. The road is cleared, the burial tools are in place. We dare to announce the entombment, may your spirit rest in peace. Respectfully announced."

Public Memorial Service at the North Station

The white cloth banner inscribed by Chairman Chiang was prominently displayed in front of the hearse. Upon arrival at 10:30 AM, local representatives from Shanghai held an unprecedented public memorial service on Platform 6. The coffin was placed in front of a special train, TBG948, which was specially arranged by the Railway Bureau. Various offerings of fruits and flowers were placed, with a large wreath from Mayor Wu in the center. At 11:30 AM, the memorial ceremony began, with Mayor Wu presiding over the service and Speaker Pan and Committee Member Fang as co-officiants. Over a hundred people attended, including Hong Lanyou, Wu Kaixian, and Zhu Heping. The ceremony concluded at 12:00 PM. Mr. Ye Chucang's coffin is scheduled to be buried at Lingyan Mountain in Suzhou at 2:00 PM on the 13th. The Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters issued a special notice on the 11th to central committee members and friends of the late Mr. Ye in Shanghai, stating that those who wish to attend the public memorial ceremony after the burial in Suzhou on the 13th can gather at the North Station waiting room at 8:30 AM on the 13th.

### Symposium of Fishery Groups Bitterly Complains of Imminent Crisis: Fishery Administration Should Produce Dried and Salted Fish for Sale Instead of Fresh Fish

The Shanghai Fishery Trade Association, the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Fishing Vessel Trade Association, the Shanghai Fishermen's Association, the Joint Office of the National Fishery Corporation, the Zhejiang Aquaculture Construction Association, and the Shanghai Fish Market Brokers Association, six organizations, held a joint meeting with the Fishery Department Director Liu Faxuan, Councilor Hou Chaohai, and Advisor Jiang Weizhi of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, who came to Shanghai, and the Shanghai Municipal Government. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Supervision Office investigated the dispute between the Lianying fishing vessels and private fishing operations, as well as the current national fishery crisis, the reasons for the factory closures, and provided opinions for the government to adopt. A fishery emergency symposium was held at 2:00 PM yesterday at Room 302, 210 Jiujiang Road, with over 30 representatives from various units attending. Lu Yanghao, the director of the National Fishery Federation, served as chairman, and spoke about the

difficult situation of the fishery industry, and pointed out the root cause of the dispute between the Lianying fishing vessels and private fishing operations. He stated: "Lianying is using Western propaganda to cover up its privileged status. Lianying fishing vessels are catching fish, causing an oversupply in the market. After the victory, our industry had 28 pairs of fishing vessels, each with a production of nearly 1,200 boxes, more than 500 boxes higher than before the war, which is sufficient to supply the Shanghai market

needs.

In July 1946, the Lianying vessels arrived in Shanghai. As of September 1947, Lianying had 46 fishing vessels at sea. The original intention was to use relief funds to engage in refrigerated facilities, manufacture fishery machinery, and build our fishery industry, but now they are devoting all their efforts to fishing, concentrating their catches in Shanghai for dumping, putting our fishery industry in a desperate situation. The current situation is not the original intention of the United Nations relief effort. Furthermore, the Fishery Administration uses the slogan "Everyone eats cheap fish" to cover up its fishing activities.

Here are some examples to prove it.

In November 1947, the Fishery Administration caught 350,000 catties of fish, receiving a total of 3 billion yuan. However, the Fishery Administration's monthly expenses are 15 billion yuan. With such huge expenses, the amount of fish caught is so small, so what is the average price per catty? It is truly appalling. Huang Zenshi, Zhu Wenkui, Hu Bifeng, and others also expressed their opinions. Finally, all representatives unanimously advocated that for the current fresh fish production, the private companies in this city are sufficient to supply the public's food needs. The government stipulated that the Fishery Administration should sell 500,000 catties of fish in the market every month, and this fresh fish should be processed into dried and salted fish for distribution throughout the country, which is in line with the principle of providing cheap food for the general public proposed by the Fishery Administration.

### Details of the Hong Pinliang Case

The Ningbo Commercial Bank has issued a statement regarding the report on the 10th that Hong Pinliang, the former manager of the Shanghai West Branch of the Ningbo Commercial Bank, took advantage of his position to embezzle all the funds of Japanese people in the branch, and colluded with his superiors and subordinates to commit fraud and arbitrarily alter accounts. The head office stated that this is inconsistent with the facts. It is claimed that: "During the Anti-Japanese War, all banks were forced by the enemy and puppet forces to accept deposits. After the victory, all enemy and puppet deposits in the branches of our bank in the Shanghai area were compiled into a list in accordance with government regulations on January 15, 1946, and submitted to the Central Bank in full, and recorded in the special account for the receipt of cash from the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration. The accounts handled by Hong Pinliang, the former manager of the West Branch, were also thoroughly investigated by the liquidation office and found to be accurate and in order, with no signs of fraud."

### Overseas Chinese in Java Plunge into a Tragic Fate

[Special Dispatch from Batavia, June 6th] Since the breakdown of negotiations between the Dutch and Indonesians on July 21st this year, and the subsequent outbreak of conflict, the lives of overseas Chinese in the interior of Java have become as fragile as a candle in the wind, a wandering soul at the bottom of a cauldron. The lines from Su Dongpo's poem, "My dreams circle the cloudy mountains, my heart like a deer; my soul flies through boiling broth and fire, my life like a chicken," perfectly describe the tragic situation of overseas Chinese in Java's interior today. According to rough estimates, the losses suffered by overseas Chinese directly or indirectly due to this war, and those who have been massacred, number no fewer than several thousand. The total number of refugees has reached over one hundred thousand. In just Re (the capital of Indonesia) alone, there are already six thousand, and in Solo, there are five thousand.

Chinese Refugee Center

The overseas Chinese in the interior of Java have always been generous and upright, thrifty and law-abiding. Whether engaged in labor or commerce, they have always adhered to the law. They have absolutely no political inclinations. Their contributions have greatly benefited local prosperity. On the island of Java, there are over six hundred thousand overseas Chinese, who have always lived in harmony with the Indonesians. The large number of Chinese-Indonesian marriages is a testament to this. Java's current status is inseparable from the pioneering efforts of the overseas Chinese. However, since the surrender of the Japanese invaders and the rise of narrow nationalism in Indonesia, some militarists who claim to be building and developing the country have adopted the tyrannical policies of the Japanese occupation period, "imitating regulations and following Cao," as the guiding principles for the governance of the new Indonesian state. At the same time, many Japanese ringleaders have infiltrated various Indonesian military and political organs, carrying out their behind-the-scenes work, fueling the flames, sowing discord, and launching both overt and covert attacks. As a result, the close relationship between the Chinese and Indonesians has been damaged. In the end, the honest and law-abiding overseas Chinese have been unable to secure protection for their lives and property. They are being massacred and robbed at will, which is truly heartbreaking!

Solemn Orders

Today, overseas Chinese in the interior of Java, not to mention those living in remote villages, cannot obtain protection from the Indonesian government. Even in Yogyakarta, the self-proclaimed capital of the Indonesian Republic, and Solo, the heart of the Indonesian Republic, there is no security to speak of.

Vice Consul Niu Shouchun's recent assignment to Yogyakarta was met with joy by the local overseas Chinese, like a traveler who has finally met long-lost parents after many years, overcome with mixed emotions. They welcomed Vice Consul Niu as a "lucky star" and "Bodhisattva." The Indonesian Republican government also considered it a great honor to have a diplomatic envoy from the great Republic of China stationed in their capital. The Indonesian government did not dare to slight their guest and specially designated a refined and elegant house at No. 8, Nisunika Mountain Street, as Niu's official residence. Earlier this month, Vice Consul Niu inspected the situation of the overseas Chinese and toured various ports. Many documents, clothes, and utensils were left in the official residence, and it was locked up. Who would have thought that just after he left Yogyakarta, an Indonesian major returning from the Malang front would forcibly move into Niu's residence? The Republican government's reception officer tried to negotiate with the major, but was scolded and humiliated by him, with no way to resolve the situation. Later, when the reception officer heard that Vice Consul Niu was about to return to Yogyakarta, he was so anxious that he paced back and forth, and had no choice but to report to the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, Sharifuddin. Sharifuddin personally issued an order for the major to move out. However, the major ignored it. Finally, Sharifuddin, in desperation, used the name of the Minister of Defense to order the relocation, but the major still paid no attention. It is said that Sharifuddin personally went to investigate, but the major still arrogantly occupied the official residence. The Prime Minister of the Cabinet could do nothing about it and had to turn away. He hurriedly sought the prestige of fellow Chinese Li Zecheng, but was still unable to make the lower-ranking military officer obey the minimum level of discipline. The consulate of the Republic of China was brazenly occupied by a military officer, and civilian and military officials did not dare to touch it. How can we expect the Indonesian government to have the ability to protect the lives and property of our overseas Chinese?

Despite our diplomats' accusations in the Security Council against Indonesian thugs for massacring overseas Chinese, despite President Sukarno, Prime Minister Sharifuddin, and General Sudirman issuing orders to protect overseas Chinese, despite the chairman of the Masjumi Party, which is most actively anti-Chinese (the former Minister of the Interior), Mr. Lum, telling our reporters: "We now send senior cadres to the countryside every week to promote the idea of Chinese-Indonesian friendship," despite the fact that in the Yogyakarta city area, a portrait of our national father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, this historical giant, is hung high, with the words: "The Three Principles of the People advocate helping the independence of small ethnic groups," the lives of overseas Chinese still cannot be guaranteed in the slightest. Until now, we have never heard of the Indonesian government arresting or executing a single Indonesian thug who massacred or robbed overseas Chinese.

A Picture of Refugees

As I was writing this, a friend, Mr. Lin, whom I had not seen for eight years, came to visit. He had just fled from the other side of Cisadane. According to Mr. Lin, "About 4,000 overseas Chinese in Balumbang, Cililitan, Tarum, Dengok, Maye, Ciguye, Citras, Sasarengan, Yegawahe, Jagong, and other places were driven by Indonesians to Lengkasbitung. They were only allowed to carry one item and one piece of clothing. They were concentrated in the barren mountains and wilderness of Ciyolo and Narimbang, living alongside poisonous snakes, fierce beasts, and vicious mosquitoes. Since there were no people living in the mountains, the refugees collected leaves to build thatched huts to shelter from the rain and sun, temporarily using them as places to rest. The most pitiable were the refugees in Narimbang. Their clothes were already tattered and torn, and even using sacks to cover their bodies was difficult. They were living the lives of "primitive people!"

The lack of supplies in the interior of Java has reached an extreme. The little bit of goods and supplies left by our Chinese merchants have been requisitioned by the Indonesians in the name of "concentration," "military use," and "official use." Chinese factories and exquisite residences have all been requisitioned. According to reliable sources, the Indonesian have planted explosives in the Chinese factories and homes in Solo and Blitar, preparing to implement a "scorched earth" policy when the Dutch army launches another "police action." Who can guarantee that the war will not reignite? Who can trust the Indonesian government to restrain the evil elements? Who would naively expect the Indonesian army's headquarters to have the ability to control all armed groups?

The Batavia Chinese General Association is constantly broadcasting the facts of Indonesian thugs harming overseas Chinese to the world, urging all people with a sense of justice and the Indonesian government itself to face reality and jointly impose sanctions. As people living in safe areas, we think that overseas Chinese in the interior of Java must be so grateful and inspired to hear this broadcast! However, on the contrary, the compatriots in "dangerous countries" unanimously requested that the broadcasts of the Batavia Chinese General Association should try to avoid containing inflammatory language, so as to prevent the Indonesians from getting angry and causing the compatriots in the interior to suffer greatly, becoming objects of venting anger. Recently, there have been two extremely painful sayings circulating among overseas Chinese in the interior of Java: "Overseas Chinese standing in heaven should also think of the people in hell when they speak!" (Special correspondent Huang Haizhen)

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties in Southern Jiangsu to Conduct Grain Stabilization Sales and Disaster Relief

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, June 10th] With grain prices rising universally in southern Jiangsu, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially notified the county governments to immediately persuade local grain merchants to sell off their surplus grain as much as possible and mobilize local wealthy merchants and gentry to conduct grain stabilization sales and disaster relief before the end of the old lunar year in order to help the impoverished people.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, June 10th] The collection of land taxes in Jiangsu Province for the previous year is stipulated to be fully completed by the 15th of this month. The deadline is approaching, but the amount collected by various counties is still far from complete. It is reported that He Wangshu, the director of the Provincial Land and Grain Office, has decided to personally inspect Changzhou, Suzhou, Songjiang, and other counties next week and separately convene county magistrates and deputy directors of county land and grain offices in neighboring counties to conduct performance evaluations and determine rewards and punishments. At the same time, after the deadline, overdue fines for land tax collection will be collected according to regulations. The first month will be 5%, the third month will be 15%, and so on.

### Zhenjiang County Assembly Opens Today

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, June 11th] The Zhenjiang County Assembly will open on the 12th with the following themes: 1. Deliberation; 2. Adjusting county education funding; 3. Determining autonomous funding; 4. Expanding and merging rural towns. It is also learned that the previous county magistrate, Zhou, accumulated a deficit of 7 billion, including: 1.

### After the Demolition of Wooden Houses in Kowloon: Miserable Overseas Chinese! Where to Settle?

[Special Dispatch from Hong Kong, June 7th] After two months of negotiations regarding the Kowloon incident, the Hong Kong government finally mobilized police and workers on the morning of the 5th to demolish the residences in the city. The Hong Kong Chinese newspapers expressed much indignation at the weak negotiations by our diplomatic authorities and great regret for the Hong Kong government's sudden and unpleasant actions while both sides were pursuing diplomatic channels. The Hong Kong Chinese newspapers seemed to have exerted their greatest efforts this time to express the suppressed feelings of millions of overseas Chinese in a special environment.

The Spirit of Public Opinion

To express the suppressed feelings of millions of overseas Chinese. The Guomin Daily published a commentary titled "Even if Chu Has Only Three Households, It Will Surely Destroy Qin!" on the 6th as a message to the residents of Kowloon.

"In yesterday's newspapers, we saw the glorious news that Burma had declared its independence from British rule and officially become an independent nation. At the same time, we also saw the terrible news that 'Hong Kong armed police were mobilized on a large scale to supervise the demolition of wooden houses in Kowloon City.' In contrast, it really makes people feel like crying and laughing at the same time, feeling inexplicable!" This is the first paragraph of the Industrial and Commercial Daily's editorial on the 6th. The Sing Tao Daily, under the title "Victims of Diplomacy," made a general review of the incident and concluded: "Mr. Zhu Peitang and Mr. Liu Yi stood up to the front for the interests of national sovereignty and neighboring communities, risking danger and deserving admiration. We extend our respectful condolences and hope that the Hong Kong government will not treat them as ordinary offenders.

Friendly Relations Between China and Britain

Will eventually lead to harmony, and efforts should be made to reduce factors that damage feelings as much as possible. Look at things from a broader perspective, the friendship of the Chinese is worth cherishing after all." Its sincere advice to the Hong Kong government can truly be said to be earnest and well-meaning.

The "Condolences to the Residents of Kowloon City" editorial in the New Life Evening News expressed much dissatisfaction with our diplomatic authorities. The newspaper said: "They were originally compatriots of the motherland. From today onwards, they are overseas Chinese! At the time of ashes and ruins, they will naturally feel the mood of "The Last Lesson." We deeply understand this mood. We cannot blame others, but only blame our diplomats!... We appeal to the government to cherish the inward orientation of overseas Chinese! The primary condition for the inward orientation of overseas Chinese is that the country provides them with protection. This responsibility of protection, no matter how small, is extremely grateful in the eyes of overseas Chinese!"

On the afternoon of the 6th, the residences of Kowloon City had been completely demolished. The former homes of every household were suddenly turned into a barren wasteland. Many displaced residents huddled among the rubble and broken tiles, with no shelter. The cold wind was piercing. Many women, who had just given birth, were pale and holding their infants, wandering around the hills, not knowing where to settle for the night. These are righteous people. How can the motherland ignore them? (Special correspondent Zi Jian)

### A Suspicious Case in the Old Capital: Judge Suspended for Abuse of Legal Loopholes

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, June 6th] On the second day of the implementation of the Constitution, a suspicious case of playing with the law to cause death occurred in Peiping. The perpetrators were too clever, and it seemed seamless. Unexpectedly, they were exposed by a clumsy law enforcer. The judge in charge has been suspended for investigation. The people of Peiping are paying close attention to the development of this suspicious case with great interest.

[As of today (the 6th), the case has progressed as follows: More than a month ago, the Criminal Police Team of Peiping arrested Ren Guorui, manager of Lihua Gold Shop, Wang Yunhua, Song Renhao, and two retired military policemen, Tian Tangchi and Tian Qingrong, on the accusation of "extortion and kidnapping" by Ning Wenxuan, the manager of Tongfasheng Silver Shop on Yangmeizhu Diagonal Street. The Criminal Police Team then transferred the group of suspects to the Peiping District Court. The judge in charge of the case, Lin Gan,

First Instance Final Judgment

Originally scheduled to pronounce the verdict at 12 noon on the 2nd of this month, the judge was nowhere to be seen at the appointed time. It was not until 5 p.m., when it was time to get off work, that Judge Lin, who was in charge of the case, came out. Instead, a clerk, Zhu Chenglin, hurriedly came out, acted as an agent in court, and announced Song Renhao's death sentence with a crumpled verdict. The other four were sentenced to life imprisonment. The news spread, and public opinion was in an uproar. Various newspapers pointed out that the case was highly questionable. According to the facts stated in the verdict, Song Renhao introduced his aunt, Liu Wang, to lend over 110 taels of gold to Lihua Gold Shop in the city. The general manager of the shop, Ren Guorui, the manager, Wang Yunhua, and the shop partner, Zhang Heming, then transferred the gold to Tongfachang Silver Shop and its manager, Chen Zemin. Because the shop went bankrupt in May of the 36th year of the Republic and manager Chen Zemin fled, the debt was pending shareholder liquidation. Song Renhao, Ren Guorui, Wang Yunhua, and Zhang Heming, who was at large, considering the loss of debt, conspired to kidnap the general manager of the shop, Ning Wenxuan, with the intention of extortion. On October 21st of the 36th year of the Republic, at around 9 p.m., Song Renhao and Ren Guorui first hired a car to invite Ning Wenxuan out. They also hired Tian Tangchi and Tian Qingrong to impersonate military police, holding a forged threatening letter, and ambushed Ning Wenxuan at the east entrance of Beibingmasi Hutong. They claimed that Ning Wenxuan was the manager of the Communist Party Border Region Bank and that they had come to handle the matter because someone had reported him. They threatened Ning Wenxuan, claiming that they were military police, etc. Then, Ning Renhao pretended to intercede and jointly kidnapped Ning Wenxuan to an empty room owned by Song Renhao at No. 6, Xin'an Lane, Xiang'er Hutong.

Extorting Ransom

100 million yuan. Because there was no cash, they forced him to sign a note under the name of Zhongyitang for a debt of 100 million yuan in national currency. Song Renhao then called Wang Zonghua and Zhang Heming to force them to sign a note for a debt of 280 taels of gold under the name of Song Renhao. Ren Guorui and Song Jishi took it to Ning's residence at No. 18, Beibingmasi the next day, asking for a shop guarantee to be added and promising to send Ning Wenxuan back, but refusing to tell Ning Wenxuan's location. On November 1st, Song Renhao, Ren Guorui, Wang Yunhua, and Zhang Heming transferred Ning Wenxuan to Song Renhao's residence at No. 7, Donghuangchenggen, Zhang's residence at No. 22, Huazhi Hutong, Waiyanshousi Street, and then back to Song's residence on the same afternoon. They forced him to sign a mortgage deed to guarantee the repayment of 280 taels of gold with his house at No. 18, Beibingmasi, before releasing Ning Wenxuan. The case was investigated and discovered by the Peiping Municipal Police Bureau. During the investigation, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit with the court."

However, according to the defendants' statements, the plaintiff deliberately created a trap, and they fell into it. It turned out that Ning had said, "The shareholders are unwilling to take out money easily. We should threaten me with a fake detention to give to the shareholders, and they will be willing to pay." Everything was a set-up, using legal loopholes.

Framing Someone

After Song Renhao was arrested, the police told him that Ning Wenxuan had accused him. Song said, "Fifth Master Ning, we have a teacher-student relationship. How could he accuse me?"

What society criticizes about this case is: 1. Song is a wealthy man and would not be a kidnapper, and besides, he is Ning's creditor. 2. Ning has an aunt, Ning Shuhua, who works as a clerk for Judge Lin Gan in the local court. Ning's lawyer Gao Xuemin also has a son, Bosheng, who is a candidate judge. 3. The sentence is too harsh.

Sure enough, public opinion had an effect. The Supervisory Group first sent Duan Muqie to the Higher Court on the 5th, ordering all suspects, Judge Lin Gan, and police clerks Ning Shuhua and Zhu Chenglin, to be suspended for thorough investigation.

This case is still developing and will be reported later. (Reporter Song Shaobo)

### Officials in Hunan Provincial Government to be Punished for Oil Felt Purchase Scheme

[Special Dispatch from Changsha, June 7th] The truth has been revealed in the case of Zhou Linzhi, director of the personnel office of the Hunan Provincial Government's Secretariat, purchasing over 300 rolls of oil felt from the Hunan Relief Branch. It is reported that in July of the 30th year of the Republic, the Hunan Relief Branch announced the sale of oil felt at a price of 140,000 yuan in national currency per roll. Each person was limited to purchasing 20 rolls and was required to submit a purchase application in advance. If the purchaser was an ordinary civilian, they needed proof from the local Baojia system. If they were civil servants, they needed proof from their service organization. At that time, Zhang Heling and 15 other staff members of the personnel office submitted individual applications based on their needs and sent them to the Hunan Relief Branch for purchase. After verification, they paid the money to the bank, received the receipt notification, and then went to the Relief Branch to issue a delivery notification before going to the storage and transportation station to pick up the goods. However, at that time, the Hunan Relief Branch, in order to simplify the procedures, issued a single total notification signed by Zhang Heling and others because Zhang Heling and others worked in the same organization. Therefore, only Zhang Heling stamped the receipt when picking up the goods and then distributed them to each person. Unexpectedly, the Hunan Relief Branch attached a copy of the distribution list of relief supplies to provincial, county, and municipal agencies with the Hai Dong telegram and sent it to the Provincial Government Accounting Office. It mistakenly listed the oil felt purchased privately by Zhang Heling and others as the amount distributed to the Secretariat. The remarks column included the words "Ten tents not issued." The Accounting Office compared it with the Hai Shan telegram and forwarded it to the Secretariat for investigation, causing misunderstandings among all parties that the materials distributed to the Secretariat had been obtained through a scheme by a few corrupt officials. Furthermore, because Zhang Heling was a staff member of the personnel office and Zhou Linzhi's fellow villager, it was mistakenly believed that Zhou Linzhi had stolen the purchase. At that time, Secretary-General Liu Gongwu was also unaware of the situation and was furious. The Provincial Government immediately sent personnel to the Relief Branch for thorough investigation, confirming that it was a private purchase at a price. The case was then clarified. However, Zhang Heling and others used the Secretariat's seal to certify their service organization without reporting to the Secretary-General in advance, which was highly inappropriate. Secretary-General Liu is currently investigating and will impose punishment.

### The Ministry of Education Develops National Higher Education, Establishes Principles for Adjusting Universities and Colleges, and Develops National Secondary Education by Promulgating an Overall Plan

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Education believes that most of the country's colleges, universities, and research institutions are concentrated in coastal cities, making it difficult to improve the level of education and culture in the interior. In order to promote the balanced development of higher education throughout the country, it has decided to make adjustments and has formulated principles, which have been sent to various colleges, universities, research institutions, and provincial and municipal education bureaus for information. The principles of adjustment are recorded as follows:

Principles for Adjusting Higher Education

The nation's human and material resources are extremely strained. All public and private colleges, universities, and research institutions should concentrate their efforts to enrich their content and improve their quality. Unless absolutely necessary, no new institutions should be established. Existing colleges, universities, and research institutions should be adjusted appropriately based on local population, economic conditions, transportation, and cultural conditions, paying attention to the establishment of educational and cultural centers in various parts of the country and considering balanced geographical development to achieve a rational distribution. Colleges and universities that were closed or merged during the War of Resistance should not be restored, except for those with a long history and outstanding achievements that are necessary to restore. The departments and faculties of public and private colleges and universities should be located in the same location and should not establish branch campuses. Colleges and universities that should be relocated should be relocated according to the locations stipulated by the Ministry of Education and should not change them on their own. A number of national educational and cultural centers are designated, and existing or relocated universities should be enriched as much as possible to become complete institutions of learning, and libraries, museums, and other independent schools and specialized schools should be allocated appropriately. The Ministry of Education will send personnel to conduct thorough inspections of provincial and private colleges and universities, and adjustment methods will be determined based on their teaching staff, facilities, and performance.

[Another Report] The Ministry of Education's entire plan for the development of secondary education has been distributed to provincial and municipal education bureaus for implementation. The main points are outlined below:

Secondary Education Development Plan

(A) Middle School Section: Each province and city should immediately and effectively divide middle school districts. Each district should have at least one provincial complete middle school, and each county should have at least one county middle school. Counties should focus on running junior high schools in principle, but may also run senior high schools when necessary. Those that have already met the above standards should quickly seek to expand the number of schools. Provinces and cities should make full use of existing schools to expand the number of classes, and should prioritize filling the quota of existing classes. Provinces and cities should pay attention to the even distribution of middle schools in the region and should not concentrate them in a few cities. The establishment of private middle schools should be encouraged and management should be strengthened. To coordinate with the development of middle school education, the implementation of advanced normal education should be strengthened. The training institutions for existing middle school teachers should immediately increase their enrollment, and short-term teacher training classes should be established when necessary. By the end of the year, every 100 graduates from central schools should have 25 entering junior high school, and every 100 junior high school graduates should have 50 entering senior high school. For the development of girls' education, each province and city should moderately increase the number of classes. To coordinate with teacher training and economic conditions, 100,000 middle school classes should be added within five years. With 40 students per class, a total of 4 million middle school students will be trained. The funding for provinces and cities to add schools and classes will be included in the budgets of the provinces and cities by the central government in installments, and the funding for counties and cities will be included in the budgets of the counties and cities by the provinces in installments. (B) Normal School Section: Normal school districts in provinces and cities that are too large or too small and inconvenient to implement should be adjusted. Each province and city that has not set up two normal schools in each normal school district should set them up completely. Each school should have at least nine classes, and each class should enroll 50 students. Each province and city must set up a simplified normal school in each county and city, except for particularly remote and impoverished areas. Each school should have at least six classes, and each class should enroll 50 students. The procedure for increasing classes and establishing schools in normal schools throughout the country is that, in order to coordinate with teacher training and economic conditions, it is planned to add approximately 10,000 normal school classes within five years. With 50 students per class, approximately 500,000 students will be trained in normal education. Provinces and cities should formulate plans for establishing schools and increasing classes in normal schools and submit them to the Ministry for approval. The expenses for provinces and cities to establish normal schools and increase classes will be included in the budgets of the provinces and cities by the central government in installments for provincial and municipal schools, and in the budgets of the counties and cities by the provinces in installments for county and municipal schools. (C) Vocational School Section: Vocational school districts that have not been divided in each province and city should be quickly delineated. Those that were temporarily divided in the past due to the impact of the war should be adjusted quickly if necessary. In addition to setting up vocational education subjects in each province and city in accordance with the needs indicated in "China's Destiny", various vocational classes related to life supplementary education (such as sewing, hairdressing, carpentry, etc.) should also be set up, reaching a minimum of training 10% of the number of people who have received national education. Provinces and cities without vocational school districts should establish junior and senior vocational schools with various subjects that meet the needs of the industry according to the production situation in each district. Provinces and cities should urge counties and cities to set up junior practical vocational schools and encourage larger public and private factories, farms, and commercial trade associations to establish vocational school classes. The procedure for establishing schools and increasing classes in vocational schools nationwide is that, in order to coordinate with teacher training and economic conditions, it is planned to add 10,000 vocational school classes within five years. With 50 students per class, approximately 500,000 students will be trained in vocational education.

### Wang Yaowu Cables the Ministry of Education Again, Requesting That Shandong Normal Specialized School Be Changed to a College

[Our Newspaper's Jinan, 11th Telegram] The movement to restore Shandong Provincial Normal Specialized School to a college has recently been launched again. A few days ago, Chairman Wang Yaowu stated that the school had repeatedly requested to be changed to a college, but had not been approved. However, considering that Shandong Province is currently in a period of pacification and that transportation is inconvenient, it is extremely important to cultivate teachers for inner schools. He specifically cabled Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, approving the change to Shandong Provincial Normal College starting from the next semester. At the same time, the students of the school also took advantage of the visit of Committee Member Sui of the Ministry of Education to Jinan for inspection and the convening of the Provincial Provisional Assembly. They held a meeting on the 8th and decided to petition all relevant parties again, not giving up until the goal is achieved.

### China Journalism College Commemorates Zhang Ji, Mr. Pan Gongzhan Expresses Infinite Emotion

[Our Newspaper's Report] China Journalism College held a memorial service for the late Chairman of the Board, Zhang Ji, yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Shaoxing Road in this city. Those from all walks of life who attended to pay their respects included Chairman Fang Xikong, Director Wu Kaixian, Xu Jiyu, Xi Yushu, Chen Baohua, Lin Sushan, Wang Yachen, etc. The service was presided over by Vice Chairman Pan Gongzhan of the school's board of directors. The ceremony was simple and solemn. After a three-minute moment of silence, the National Government's commendation order was read. Mr. Pan Gongzhan said in his speech: Today is the memorial service for Chairman Zhang Puquan. Looking back to the two years since the school was founded, Chairman Zhang devoted his utmost effort to the school, assisting Principal Chen in administering the school. We are here today to commemorate him, and our emotions are many. The words that Chairman Zhang spoke to the students when he came to the school a year ago are still vividly clear in our ears. The scene is like yesterday. His spirit will live forever and will be engraved in our hearts. When good people heard the news of his death, they held a memorial service before the memorial services held by various circles in Shanghai. The meaning of this is not only a private relationship between colleagues, teachers and students, but also a greater relationship, that is, his life's contribution to the party and the country and the spirit of leadership, which we will never forget and admire. Now that he has suddenly passed away, the blows and losses to the country and to us will be self-evident. His life's work can be summarized by two sentences in the National Government's commendation order: "Steadfast but not stubborn, harmonious but not compromising", worthy of being a "model teacher", worthy of our promotion and emulation. Mr. Pan continued: Today, in commemorating Mr. Puquan, we must achieve two goals: Continue the spirit of Chairman Zhang's leadership and Principal Chen's administration of the school, carry it forward, and lay the foundation for a revolutionary journalist academy. Recognize that his life was dedicated to fighting for the country, and we should follow in his footsteps, be loyal to the party and the country, and fulfill the responsibilities of journalists. Before his death, he once said to Director Lin: "China Journalism College should work hard to run well". Unfortunately, these words were his last words. In the future, we must follow this instruction, support the school, cultivate young people, and comfort his spirit in heaven. After Mr. Pan's speech, representatives of guests Fang Zhi, Principal, faculty, alumni, and students spoke in succession. Finally, Ms. Zhang Lin, daughter of Mr. Zhang, gave a reply. The ceremony ended at about 4:00 PM.

### Inter-Port Football Trial Match: White Team Wins Against Blue Team, 4-1 in the Rain

The Shanghai Inter-Port First Trial Match between the Blue and White teams was held at Yiyi Field at 2:30 PM yesterday. Despite the drizzling rain, the audience did not hold back, with over 6,000 people attending. Dai Shixin, Wu Qixiang, Zhang Lingen, Yue Renxiao, and Gao Baozheng, among others, were unable to play due to injuries. Zhuang Youren and Chen Mingzhe were invited to participate, while Chen Jiawan and Han Longhai also suffered injuries and only played in the first half. As a result of the match, the White team won 4-1.

White Team Dominates, Scores Three Consecutive Goals

Referee was Chen Jixiang, linesmen were Wu Shouheng and Zhang Le. The Blue team kicked off, but their five forwards were blocked. After back and forth play, the White team seemed to have the upper hand with frequent attacks. Tie Funing once headed the ball to save it, almost resulting in a comical own goal. After a stalemate until the 25th minute, Han Longhai of the White team committed a foul on Fei Chunhua on the right wing. Fei dribbled a few steps, then kicked the ball, which flew like an arrow into the net. The White team opened the score. The Blue team launched a full-scale counterattack to no avail. Ten minutes later, Zuo Zhuang hooked the ball in, Hua Yi picked it up, and A Sun kicked it in the air from the left, sending the ball straight to the right corner, a beautiful and clear shot. The White team took a 2-0 lead. A few minutes later, Xiao Fei penetrated again, passed the ball to the center, and Xia Tixian was waiting, scoring another goal, making it 3-0. At this time, Chen Jiawan of the Blue team's foot injury worsened, and he announced his retirement. Zhuang Youren replaced him. Soon after, the first half ended, with the White team leading by three goals.

Lineup Adjustment, Average Strength

After the break, the two teams regrouped, and the rain intensified. Both sides played in the rain. Han Longhai of the White team announced a short break due to his original foot injury. Grinas of the Blue team was transferred to replace him, and Robert Stoff arrived in time to take over the central forward position for the Blue team. With these changes, the strength of the two teams became more balanced, and the Blue team's offensive also increased. After a fierce attack, the Blue team turned the tide. Lu Qingxiang received the ball and passed it to the right, and Mingzhe's nephew Gou followed up in the center. Xiao Huangmao used his skills to break the White team's goal for the first time, making it 1-3. This was followed by a stalemate until the 37th minute, when Grinas fired a cold arrow from 30 yards away, breaking the net. When time ran out, the White team won 4-1.

### Song Yixin Departs for Japan Today to Negotiate the Export of Taiwan Sugar; Will Discuss Payment Issues with the Allied Headquarters

[Our Newspaper's Report] Song Yixin, Associate Manager of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, has scheduled to fly to Japan via Northwest Airlines at 9:00 AM this morning to negotiate the export of Taiwan sugar to Japan. He is expected to return to Shanghai in two weeks. He told reporters before his departure: The export plan for Taiwan sugar this year is tentatively set at 100,000 tons, of which 50,000 tons will be exported to Japan. The selling price of exported Taiwan sugar will be determined by referring to the world sugar market price to compete with foreign sugar. In the past few months, the world sugar price has been around US$200 per ton. Recently, the market price has weakened to about US$150 per ton. The export price of Taiwan sugar to Japan cannot exceed this standard to gain a foothold in the Japanese market. During this trip, he will negotiate with the Allied Headquarters on the procedures for paying for the sugar. Once the negotiations are finalized, the first batch of sugar for export to Japan, amounting to 25,000 tons, can be shipped from the beginning of February.

### The Ministry of Finance is Studying This Year's Public Debt Policy

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 10th to preside over the first lottery for public debt due this year. He completed the lottery on the evening of the 11th and returned to Beijing. When reporters asked Mr. Chen about the rumor that the Ministry of Finance was planning to issue US$300 million in new US dollar public debt, Mr. Chen did not give a definite answer, but only said that the Ministry of Finance was actively studying how to use public debt policy this year to coordinate with the national economic and financial policies, and that there were no concrete conclusions to announce at this time.

### South China Import Management Branch Suggests Strengthening Imports

[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou, 9th Telegram] After the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, imports from Hong Kong to South China have not been relaxed. It is learned that the South China Import Management Branch has formulated six major suggestions to strengthen imports based on the current situation and submitted them to the General Association for implementation. The main points are: (A) Restore the temporary implementation measures of last year, allowing each business to import five times a month, so that accumulated goods in Hong Kong can be easily imported. (B) Relax the import quota for self-provided foreign exchange. The environment in South China is special, and this method may be suitable for current needs. It is also reported that the branch has decided to relax the qualifications for examining importers. It has also decided to set up an appeal committee to accept special requests from merchants and people regarding import and export.

Regarding the liquidation of the Guangdong Industrial Company, the Guangdong Provincial Council had previously resolved to conduct the liquidation directly. However, the Provincial Government recently stated that the Provincial Council has no right to liquidate provincial state-owned industrial organizations, and can only send representatives to participate in the Provincial Government's liquidation organization. After hearing the news, the Provincial Council expressed great indignation and has decided to jointly conduct the liquidation of the company's accounts with the Supervisory Office, the Court, the Audit Office, and other institutions.

### Saying "Auditing New Brokers" is Inaccurate, Says Securities Exchange Authority; Rumors of New Stocks Being Listed are Also Unfounded

[Our Newspaper's Report] It has recently been rumored that the Shanghai Securities Exchange will approve a batch of new brokers, granting them licenses to operate. It is also rumored that several new stocks have also been reviewed and approved and will be listed one after another. When reporters inquired with the responsible parties of the Securities Exchange yesterday, they were informed that both rumors were completely unfounded. Since its opening, the Securities Exchange has only approved one batch of brokers when it first opened, and has never handled broker audits since then. Even if there is a need to add brokers due to business needs, it should be formally announced publicly to openly accept external applications. However, the Securities Exchange currently feels that there is no need to add brokers. As for those who have applied to list new stocks, although some manufacturers have filled out forms and provided documents to apply for listing, the Securities Review Committee has not been convened recently, and no new stocks have been approved for listing.

### Newsprint Slightly Decreases

Due to the shortage of paper on the market, those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell them easily, and buyers cannot purchase goods. As a result, prices have continued to rise in recent days. For example, the highest price of newsprint on the market on Thursday was 2.2 million yuan per ream, 1.9 million yuan for open-faced paper, and other papers also reached new records. It was not until the near weekend that prices gradually fell. Newsprint fell by 300,000 yuan to 1.9 million yuan, and open-faced paper fell to 1.7 million yuan. Compared with the end of the year, the prices of various papers have increased by 30 to 40%.

### Total Export Volume of Taiwan Tea Last Year Was Approximately 10 Million Taiwan Jin

Through the continuous efforts of the government and tea merchants over the past two years, the export of Taiwan tea has recovered to more than 46% of its peak. According to statistics from the Taiwan Tea Association, the total export volume of Taiwan tea last year was 9,775,450 Taiwan jin, including 4,246,842 Taiwan jin of Pouchong tea, 1,261,270 Taiwan jin of Oolong tea, 3,745,405 Taiwan jin of black tea, and 521,941 Taiwan jin of other tea, an increase of 3,627,738 Taiwan jin compared to the total export volume of 6,147,720 Taiwan jin in the 35th year of the Republic of China. The peak period was in the 28th year of the Republic of China, at 21,099,743 Taiwan jin.

### Imported Cigarettes: Resuming Stamping for Tax Payment

Regarding foreign-made cigarettes, the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, upon the order of the Ministry of Finance, had been handling the matter of resuming the practice of affixing verification stamps to each package for tax payment. In December of last year, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Cigarette Guild, and representatives of cigarette merchants, citing the excessive burden of stamp affixing and tax supplementation, requested that all existing stocks of cigarettes held by merchants, for each foreign cigarette brand with a quantity of fewer than five thousand cigarettes, be exempted from tax and stamp affixing. The bureau forwarded this request to the Ministry of Finance for approval, but it was not approved. Therefore, strict enforcement will be carried out in the near future. To prevent merchants from breaking up large quantities into smaller ones to evade taxation, assistance has been requested from relevant authorities in the city. Subsequently, if any foreign cigarettes are found without verification stamps, regardless of the quantity, they will be confiscated and forfeited to the government, and the case will be transferred to the court for penalty.

Slight Decrease in Cigarette Prices

Another report: Yesterday, the cigarette market initially saw a decline due to selling pressure from bullish speculators. However, it rebounded because of the support from merchants' hedging activities. Recently, a significant amount of Yizhong and British Old Knife brand cigarettes were resold by counterparts in other cities. As a result, the market price recovered slightly, rising by 300,000 to 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Great Kress cigarettes saw a shipment release, causing a drop of 4,000 yuan, while other brands experienced minor declines.

Soap Price Drops

The price of daily-use soap has fallen due to a large holder facing tight funds and selling off a significant amount of spot goods. As a result, besides the leveling of Guben soap, Xiangmao soap fell by 230,000 yuan, and other brands also saw minor declines of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. However, the market for matches, candles, and kerosene remained stable.

Science

### Aurora

— Yu

The world is a place that generates or contains mystery, where there are many things that are elusive or unpredictable. Among them also grow a kind of people who call themselves wise, but to this day cannot answer the question of their own origin. Or they may push it onto the Creator, but the Creator itself becomes a problem, so they can only entrust it to mystery.

The aurora is a mysterious thing, but looking at its folded posture and fantastic colors, it can truly be described as myriad purples and reds, and all kinds of enchanting beauty. Like a curtain on the sky, graceful and charming, like the beautiful streamers of sunset glow, or like a ribbon around the space.

Sweden, Norway, Canada, and Alaska often have the spectacle of the Northern Lights, and the frequency of their occurrence is not as low as imagined. Ordinary people think that the discovery of the aurora must be at the North and South Poles. In fact, this is not the case, because we know that the Earth's magnetic field fluctuates. This magnetic variation can be measured with an ordinary compass. If it aligns with a certain place, then that place is the magnetic pole. The cause of this magnetic change comes from sunspots. But the aurora is caused by the Earth's magnetic field, so the aurora can shift with the southern magnetic field.

The aurora not only expresses its beauty in color, but also in its unique shape. The most common shape is roughly like a spiral, sometimes without color, only radiating light, sparkling and dazzling. Sometimes, all kinds of colors intertwine, it is dazzling. Most of the positions are fixed, but a small part quickly jumps up and down, left and right, like a spring under force, and emits a needle-like light, of varying lengths, adhering to the upper edge of the main band, with varying degrees of darkness and height. There is also a fan-shaped shape, and a crown-like shape, but they are not usually seen. This form of aurora may be more moving than the former, but unfortunately, the occurrence of this type of aurora is often in very high altitudes, about six hundred miles or more, and ordinary people's eyes may not be able to see it clearly.

In the past, people generally believed that the aurora was an unpredictable and extremely mysterious phenomenon, just like seeing a solar eclipse. According to scientists who are currently engaged in the study of the aurora, they have obtained two theories through observation and exploration: one is that the light emitted by the sun has an extremely short wavelength, which is a kind of radiant energy, such as ultraviolet rays. The atmosphere at high altitudes is relatively thin and easily collides with this short-wave radiation, ionizing itself, that is, bearing an electrical charge. These large particles, composed of various gas molecules, are charged by the energy of short-wave radiation. Let us assume that a hydrogen atom is composed of a nucleus, that is, a proton, and an electron around it. Let it pass through a vacuum tube with high voltage, so that the gas discharges in the tube and generates light. Now let us imagine that the electrons outside the nucleus can leap through many energy planes in a certain way. From the nucleus, these energy planes are divided into several levels, marked as one, two, three, four, five, etc. When hydrogen atoms are normally at rest, electrons are on the first plane. But when energy is added to the atom, hydrogen discharges in the vacuum tube, and the electron on the first plane leaps into the outer, higher energy plane, or even completely leaps out of the atom. Hydrogen then becomes a hydrogen ion, that is, it is ionized. If the applied energy is immediately removed at this time, the electron will return to the inner layer from the higher energy plane. In this way, when the electron jumps from a higher energy plane to a lower energy plane, the added energy is released and transformed into light. The greater the drop in the energy layer, the shorter the duration of light emission, which is the cause of ultraviolet rays. Now that we understand the generation of light, it is not difficult to understand the principle of gas ionization and the generation of aurora.

Another theory is that the sun directly emits high-energy charged particles at a very high speed, roughly one thousand miles per second. These high-speed particles may be deflected by a weak magnetic field, so these particles form the aurora far away from the earth, and then go down along the magnetic lines of force. The closer they get to the ground, the stronger the magnetic force they are subjected to, so the degree of deflection is also greater, so the aurora is formed into a spiral shape with a large base and a small pointed top. The lowest aurora is forty-five miles high, and the highest is six hundred miles high. The aurora can also affect radio communication, because the ionization of the gas can have the same properties as a conductor, and it can also make photographic dry plates sensitive, so its height and distance can be measured.

### The Element of the Atomic Age: Plutonium 94

— Gang Ren

The difficulties in separating plutonium from uranium isotopes, such as the lack of differences in various properties and the extreme similarity in weight, have also been solved. Because it is another element, it has different chemical and physical properties from uranium, so it is possible to obtain it by a relatively simple method.

But at that time, the plutonium produced by the cyclotron was too little. Several weeks of work yielded only a few micrograms of plutonium. You know, one gram is one twenty-eighth of an ounce, and one microgram is one millionth of a gram, which is equivalent to about one three hundred and fifty millionth of an ounce. The air capacity in a human lung is 250,000 micrograms, which is almost 100,000 times more than the plutonium sample at that time. We can often imagine how little it was.

However, scientists will not be discouraged. In the autumn of 1942, Cunnigham and Weruer weighed the first pure plutonium. At the end of the year, they obtained 500 micrograms of pure plutonium. This was not enough to cover the head of a nail, but it was extremely important for the study of plutonium. With these small gains, the large research work could begin, and the establishment of the Plutonium-Seperationplant in Clinton Teun, Tennessee.

Because there are methods for studying the smallest substances in modern science. That is Tracer Chemiotry. They use Geiger counters to indirectly measure radioactivity from a solution in which trace amounts of plutonium and compounds of other elements coexist, and deduce its properties. Precise pulse analyzers are used to detect the velocity of radioactive particles to distinguish various radioactive particles. Various precise instruments, balances, and containers are used to record its weight and perform various experiments. Therefore, trace amounts of substances can still be used for various tests.

Scientists further reformed tracer chemistry and established a more precise method, which is Ultra-Microchemistry. They reduced the precision of all the techniques and methods of Micro-Chemistry again. The weight is weighed with a Micro-balance. Heating and precipitation are carried out in Micro-electrodes, micro-crucibles and micro-tubes. The most sensitive balance in the University of California laboratory can weigh one microgram of substance with an error of less than one percent.

As a result, mankind fully understood the chemical process of separating uranium and plutonium and obtained pure plutonium. It also became familiar with all its properties.

Further expansion enabled the first plutonium-producing Pile to work in Hanlordi Washington, separated it, and made the atomic bomb.

Professor Smyth of the Clinton plant had a detailed report. From there, we can know that in the atomic pile, plutonium is a pure uranium rod, passing through many basements made of mixed concrete. That is called the "Cauyon". Each part has the necessary dissolving pool, settling pool, and agitator (Centrifuges). Repeated changes, melting, and sedimentation occur, and plutonium is separated in the end.

Scientists in 1944 had completed the manufacture of plutonium on a scale ten billion times larger than what they had obtained in their experiments. And it reached the point where the loss was less than 20 percent. In the summer of 1945, the Hanford plutonium production plant reached a fairly perfect state, capable of producing enough plutonium to be used as the raw material for atomic bombs.

However, the road ahead is still full of difficulties if scientists hope that plutonium can truly benefit mankind. It is unknown how much effort it will take to achieve the goal of two pounds per day.

Professor Smyth's plan is to hope to obtain a production of two pounds per day, so as to obtain 500,000 to 15 million watts of electrical energy. This huge power.

From an economic point of view, if each kilowatt of electricity is calculated at three US cents, then 22 million US dollars of coal can be saved every month to obtain electricity.

From the point of view of power plants, the abundance of power supply is even more sufficient than the power generated by the water power that can be used by the Grand Coulec water gate, which is the largest in the world. (To be continued)

### Automatic Switch

— Hong En

All kinds of automatic switches, such as radios, electric stoves, and electric lights, can be made to turn on and off automatically at a certain time. Its outer surface looks like an old clock. As long as one side is connected to the object and one end is plugged into the socket on the wall, it will automatically turn on or off at the time you set without any mistake.

The sound of the bedside radio often likes to lull listeners into sweet dreams. If there is an automatic switch, it can be turned off for you in the middle of the night, and the radio will be powered on again at 7 o'clock the next day to wake you up. Also, the electric fan will serve you until you fall asleep on hot nights.

### Supplement to the Sinicization of Number Segmentation

— Zhang Zicai

Read December 22, 1947. The article "Sinicization of Number Segmentation" written by Mr. Zhou Shimin in the 21st issue of this journal, which refers to "Numerotion" in mathematics, urgently needs to be improved. I agree very much and have long had a record of it, recorded in a private book, but I have been hesitant to publish it. Now, according to the old records, I will supplement it for Mr. Zhou. The "Tong Li" written by Mr. Yu Quyuan of Deqing in the late Qing Dynasty is to straighten out the "Gujin Yunhui" written by Li Renqing of the Yuan Dynasty. Li was very studied in arithmetic and cited many national languages and Wei Zhao's notes. Quyuan said that what Li said was the ancient number, which is different from the current number. The current number refers to the numeration method used at that time in the Qing Dynasty. The numeration method of our Republic of China seems to be connected to the old one of the Qing Dynasty, and the calculation of Arabic numeral formulas mostly follows the Western method, with a comma (,) added every three digits. However, the arrangement of the numeration method of our country's current number is actually one level for every four digits. However, the government believes that the current number is three digits, while the old numeration is four digits, which is inconsistent. Having been aware of this for a long time, the Ministry of Education issued a circular in June 1931, before the terms of the number of records were determined. For the time being, the words "yi" (億) and "zhao" (兆), which have ambiguities in arithmetic, will be cancelled. The numbers above "wan" (萬) are crowned with numbers above the word "wan", such as ten wan (十萬), hundred wan (百萬), thousand wan (千萬), wan wan (萬萬), ten wan wan (十萬萬), hundred wan wan (百萬萬), etc. Quyuan said there were two tables, one for ancient numbers and one for current numbers. The ancient numbers take ten "wan" (萬) as "yi" (億), and ten "yi" (億) as "zhao" (兆), which was not applicable at that time, so I will not repeat it now. Now I will record the current number table as follows:

One Ten ones are ten Ten tens are hundred Ten hundreds are thousand

Ten thousands are ten thousands Ten ten thousands are hundred thousands Ten hundred thousands are million Ten million thousands are ten million

Ten thousand ten thousands are hundred million Ten ten million are billion Ten hundred million are ten billion Ten thousand billion are hundred billion

Ten thousand billion are trillion Ten ten trillion are hundred trillion Ten hundred trillion are ten trillion Ten thousand trillion are hundred trillion

Ten thousand trillion are jing Ten ten jing are hundred jing Ten hundred jing are ten jing Ten thousand jing are hai

Ten thousand hai are hai Ten ten hai are hundred hai Ten hundred hai are ten hai

Since the government issued a circular long ago, this table seems to be no longer applicable today. In recent days, it has become increasingly larger. I have seen people using "yi" (億) to write checks, and I immediately informed them of the government's order, recognizing that the use of the word "yi" (億) is illegal. Later I asked those who specialize in accounting, who said that the word "yi" (億) can be used, there was a circular, but I was negligent and did not see it. The Western name takes million as Million and ten thousand ten thousand as Billion. Now, as Mr. Zhou mentioned, the number 6.39 billion is written in three digits as follows:

Ten Billion Billion Ten Million Million Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Thousand Hundred Ten One

6,390,000,000.

If it is written in four digits, it is as follows:

Ten Billion Billion Ten Million Million Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Thousand Hundred Ten One

63,9000,0000.

Bill Mill

From this point of view, Mr. Zhou's three points, can avoid irregular memory; improvement will help popularize science; we cannot always follow people's ideas and should strive for self-improvement, these two points are very meaningful, and I agree very much, so I specially supplement them.

Also, the names of the arithmetic numbers in our country, according to the records in various books, are all based on the "Shushu Jiyi" written by Xu Yue. Its names are "yi (一), shi (十), bai (百), qian (千), wan (萬), yi (億), zhao (兆), jing (京), gai (垓), zi (秭), shu (杼), gou (溝), jian (澗), zheng (正), zai (載)", etc. From the word "yi (億)" to the word "zai (載)" is ten digits, and above that there are names such as "Ganges sand" and "immeasurable number".

Quyuan's table takes "jing (京)" as "jing (經)", and "hai (核)" as "hai (咳)", also written as "gai (姟)". Although his description is all based on historical data, it is not as popular as the names recorded by Xu Yue. I think the government should issue an order on the number of lives in the shortest possible time.

Quyuan divides ancient numbers and current numbers into two types, or it is said that the numeration method is divided into three levels, one is Quyuan's ancient number, one is Quyuan's current number, and the other is to take ten thousand ten thousand as "yi (億)", and ten thousand yi as "zhao (兆)", which is not applicable today, so it will not be described in detail, but scholars must know it.

### How Old is the Earth?

— Zhang Changqing

How old is the earth? There have been many speculations about this problematic question before. Experts who study paleontology say: Humans have existed for 50,000 years. If the age of the ape-man is also included, it is fully hundreds of thousands of years, so the age of the earth is about millions of years.

Geologists have studied various rocks, deposits, and volcanic results, and feel that the oldest rocks on Earth are 200 million years old.

Some people have also used the amount of invertebrate bone ash accumulated in the sea to prove that there was life in the sea tens of millions of years ago. But before there was life, how many years did the earth exist for, no one knows, and there is no accurate calculation.

Now, for the sake of everyone's research on atomic bombs, everyone is paying attention to rare metals such as uranium and steel, which are the raw materials for atomic bombs. It has been found that every two taels of uranium will only have half a tael left after 4.5 billion years. The remaining half tael becomes lead. This lead is somewhat different from ordinary lead and can be identified. Now, by calculating the composition of this lead from the uranium ore and comparing the composition of the uranium, a year can be calculated.

But strangely, although the age of uranium ore varies, the calculated answer is always 1.99 billion years. This method of calculating the age of the Earth is certainly much more accurate.

### New Research on the Sense of Smell

— Yang Shi

Of our several primary senses, the sense of smell is the last to be understood. For years, scientists have racked their brains to dissect and experiment, hoping to find the source of the nose's sense of smell, but all have failed. On the contrary, this mysterious thing has made spice merchants a great deal of money. At the end of November 1947, Dr. Lloyd H. Beck and Dr. Walter R. Miles of Yale University in the United States, after years of research and experimentation, now published a very novel theory about the sense of smell of the nose. The average person and past physiologists always believed that the nose is a chemical laboratory that uses chemical analysis methods to identify odors, but this is completely wrong. The nose is originally an instrument specifically used to measure the infrared rays absorbed by odorous gases.

Scientists have long known that odorous gases can absorb infrared rays of a certain wavelength. In industry, this phenomenon has been used to identify gases; and chemists often radiate infrared rays into odorous gases to observe some physical reactions of these gases after absorbing infrared rays. This led Dr. Beck and Dr. Miles to believe that the sense of smell must be related to infrared rays. After years of experimentation, they finally proved that their ideal was correct.

They have collected a lot of experimental data, and researched that infrared wavelengths between 7.5 one ten-thousandth of a centimeter and 14 one ten-thousandth of a centimeter will be absorbed by odorous gases, while odorless gases have no reaction. And it so happens that most of the wavelengths of the heat waves radiated by the human body at normal temperature are within this range. So how does the sense of smell happen? In the nostrils, there is an "odor receptor" that lies across the airflow channel, containing special cells. The temperature of the tissue around the cells is relatively low, so these hot cells radiate heat waves to the surrounding tissue, like a small radio station sending out radio waves. When pure air flows through this channel, the cells have no reaction, and the rate of radiating heat does not change. Assuming that odorous gas flows through the channel, it immediately absorbs a part of the heat waves emitted by the cells, and the rate of radiation must increase, thus stimulating the cells to produce a special reaction, which is the sense of smell.

In order to confirm this theory, Dr. Beck and Dr. Miles first used cockroaches for experiments, because the sense of smell of cockroaches is controlled by antennae exposed outside the body. They released the vapor of clove oil, which is most able to attract cockroaches, outside a tightly sealed window, and it would smell this odor inside the window, trying to rush out of the window; the reason is that the infrared rays radiated from its antennae can pass through this window. If the window is replaced with a glass plate that infrared rays cannot pass through, it will not smell anything and will have no impulse. The same result was obtained by using honey to attract bees. Their antennae are exposed outside, and they can radiate heat waves to distant places, making the sense of smell reach a very far distance.

The structure of the human nose is complex, and it cannot be tested now. The entire olfactory instrument is deeply buried inside the nose, and there is no way to artificially absorb the infrared rays radiated by the cells. Dr. Beck and Dr. Miles claim that as long as they can get an infrared spectrophotometer, they can test it.

This revolutionary new theory obviously needs deeper research and more experiments by scientists to determine its value. If it is indeed the case, then a new science will be created in science—smelling spectroscopy. In the future, scientists can combine two gases with different odors to produce heat waves that can absorb another certain wavelength, that is, produce a third new odor, so that our noses can get more happiness. About these researches and experiments, two or three years ago, rumors spread to the ears of those fox-like spice merchants. Currently, they are trying to obtain the complete report of this research in order to manufacture the world's newest and most seductive spices for both men and women.

### Radioactive Isotopes: The Production of the Latest Atomic Drugs

— Sun Jialin

Besides the awe and terror that atomic energy, which has shocked the world, has given us in the form of the atomic bomb, it has also given us unlimited energy and hopeful new drugs. Researchers have definitively proved that thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism can be treated with radioactive iodine. Leukemia and polycythemia can be treated with radioactive phosphorus. The United States has recently begun to share its atomic knowledge with the world. President Truman declared that radioactive isotopes can be supplied to foreign scientists to jointly combat diseases and improve human welfare. Not long ago, a special plane carried phosphorus-32 to the National X-ray and Radium Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia for application.

Isotopes are atoms of the same element but with different weights. We know that in a typical atom, an electron cloud orbits around a nucleus. In the nucleus, there are two kinds of molecules, one with a positive charge, called a proton, and the other with no charge, called a neutron. When an atom is bombarded with neutrons, if the neutron is absorbed by the nucleus, an isotope is formed. The chemical and biological properties of this element remain unchanged, but its weight has changed.

Some isotopes are unstable. Their nuclei break apart and release radiation similar to light, thus producing radioactivity. For example, the nucleus of uranium-235 (the starting point of the atomic bomb) has ninety-two protons and one hundred and forty-two neutrons, and is explosive.

The radioactive isotopes of certain elements are like microscopic mirrors. As soon as they enter the body, they emit a kind of energy that can be recorded, so we can clearly see its process and changes in the human body. For example, how does a sugar containing isotopes travel in the digestive system after being eaten? How does it change? How does it become working ability? All can be traced and indicated.

Experts say that the widespread use of radioactive elements may help explain how the human body becomes old, thus clarifying many unconquered diseases. Some isotopes remain in certain tissues and emit short-range radiation to eliminate cancer and malignant tumors, eliminating the need for surgery.

So far, ninety-six kinds of isotopes have been produced. Their uses are waiting for scientists to study and utilize. These atoms will surely give people happiness and health.

Free Talk

### Selling Cruelty

— Ji Yong

Someone talked about winter relief and donating cotton clothes today, which made me quite emotional. It happened that I went out today. On a street where I live, which is nominally a big city but is actually as dirty as a pigsty or dog kennel, besides the people who can be encountered everywhere who are "washing endlessly" under the wall with "faucets inside, urinating prohibited," there are also vegetable stalls that are packed and impassable. Walking through this mud-like crowd, there was a beggar in his forties, pulling a cart with small wheels, on which lay a middle-aged man resembling a zombie, with his legs gone, only a piece of flesh sticking out. Another younger person was shouting with a hoarse voice, asking others to give them sympathy. Even if I still have a bit of compassion, I don't know why, but when I saw such a ferocious performance, I had to glance away and didn't dare to extend the "hand of pity."

Unexpectedly, walking further past, on one side of the vegetable stall, there was an even more bizarre sight. A female beggar of about fifty years old was reaching out for money, while a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl, yellow-faced and emaciated, was kneeling close to her, holding a wooden bowl, chewing a mouthful of rice bran. The bowl was also full of it. There seemed to be tear stains in the girl's eyes. On the side of the bowl, "philanthropists" had already put down more than a dozen thousand-yuan bills, and it seemed that the results were already good.

My heart moved. Leaving aside the matter of whether the girl was well-fed and warm, it is probably not easy for a mother to let her daughter perform by swallowing chaff, using this to collect money. The wise King Solomon used killing the baby to determine the authenticity of the mother. A true mother would of course cry bitterly. The greatness of motherhood lies in this, and the pitiful motherhood is also worth our help. If she sacrifices her own daughter with tears (possibly because she was beaten for not wanting to) to perform this trick, this mother probably has a big problem in her identity. Whether those banknotes can bring warmth to the daughter is especially uncertain.

Chinese people are perhaps the most fond of appreciating cruelty, so killings must be carried out in the marketplace to show the public, and the great bandit is not afraid of death, also boasting of "being a good man again in twenty years." When "executing prisoners," the pits and valleys are full, taking it as a rare and lively event, and newspaper reporters must take a photo as material. These are all ironclad facts. Other countries have been secretly executing death sentences for fifty years, as if we turn a blind eye, it's all the same. The two can't be confused. Although Sima Qian's articles are good, such as the "Biographies of Assassins," with such records as "Grateful for your kindness and allow you to carry out the order, throwing Mount Tai is as light as a feather," treating beheading and suicide as commonplace, it's really not a good thing. The Japanese are proud of seppuku, such as the Forty-seven Ronin of Ako, etc., but bravery and cruelty eventually led to the tragic self-immolation. I think the "two-sword style" Bushido is nothing great, although there is a perverse spirit of loyalty. A nation cannot establish a broad and lofty foundation on magnanimity, tolerance, peace, and rectitude. There is always a feeling of "a gust of wind does not last the whole morning, a torrential rain does not last the whole day." At least, I feel this way. Maybe my nerves are too weak.

Some beggars in the north specialize in eating sulfur in winter. When spring comes, they develop sores all over their bodies and lie on the streets to earn the assistance of philanthropists. In fact, they use the money to buy white liquor and smoked pork. If they have more, they go to gambling houses. This is one thing. There are also street performers who sell solutions. At the last performance, there must be a performance of killing a son with a knife and dismembering him into eight pieces. If the audience doesn't see this, they always feel that it's not enjoyable. This is another thing. The purpose and method of both are the same: using people's curiosity to arouse abnormal sympathy to achieve the plan of deceiving money. For those who are crying from hunger and cold, we should "share sparingly," and treat the hunger of others as our own, not just sympathy and relief, but directly regard it as our own pain. Zhang Hengqu's "Western Inscription" says it well, "The people are my brothers and sisters, and all things are my companions." Naturally, there should be no harsh picking, but if we are deceived by impostors, it is equivalent to being exploited by others. The more those parasites get, the less the truly pitiful people get. We must make choices.

Moreover, for this old nation, it is now suffering from all kinds of diseases. If there is no clear heat and detoxify the root cause, to stop many internal hidden dangers, the danger is indescribable. For example, there are so many pitiful people in society. If we act arbitrarily and enforce orders, I am afraid that the word "cruel" is not limited to the small matter of making a daughter eat chaff! Alas, what else is there to say!

### Mother's Love

— Li Qingcheng

A few years ago, when Australia was hit by a drought, wild animals in the forest were so thirsty that they even dared to come to the doors of local residents to find water to drink, but these residents were also in bad luck. Their livestock, cattle and sheep, were also dying in droves due to lack of water, so the residents had to prepare a loaded gun at the door to be careful that this bit of precious water would not be drunk by wild animals.

On a hot summer day, a resident suddenly found a kangaroo running out of the forest, with a joey in its pouch. He immediately learned how to shoot, but the kangaroo slowly ran across the scorched open space around the house, getting closer and closer. Its brown, beautiful eyes were pleadingly staring at the resident, and it ran straight to the bucket of water, which was left for the livestock that had not yet died. The resident actually forgot to shoot.

It reached the bucket, stood there, its gentle eyes still staring at the resident. At this time, the joey in its pouch quickly drank enough. Immediately, it turned around, without drinking a drop of water itself, and ran across the open space towards the depths of the forest. The resident stared at it blankly, until it disappeared. He put down the gun, his heart feeling like it was stuffed with a heavy lead block.

### Learning

— Le

The natural science teacher lectured on the story of Franklin's discovery of electricity. Little John, who was sitting in the back row, said: "You never study hard. After hearing Franklin's story, do you feel ashamed? But if you are willing to change from now on and study hard, you can also become like Franklin one day and become a great inventor."

Little John said softly: "Teacher, did Franklin discover electricity by reading it from books?"

### Thinking of Lenin's Death

— Mao Ren

A few days ago, the newspaper reported the news that Soviet Marshal Stalin was ill, and the evening newspaper even reported that he had died in the Swiss capital. I think the news that Stalin is dead is just a rumor, because if Stalin dies, the Soviet Union has no need to keep the news secret. Lenin died on the night of January 21, 1924. On the morning of the 22nd, Chairman Kalinin convened the All-Soviet Congress to report the bad news. At that time, the Soviet Union was far more turbulent than it is today, yet it did not keep the news secret, let alone at a time of national prosperity and peace today.

The public announcement of Lenin's death was only a few words: "Vladimir Ilyich (Lenin was originally a pseudonym) suddenly became seriously ill on January 21. Breathing stopped and he fell into a coma at 5:10 pm; he died at 6:50 pm due to paralysis of the respiratory center." But the moment when Kalinin reported the bad news to the All-Soviet Congress was particularly moving. The congress convened at 11:50 am. Kalinin had not slept all night and his face was covered in tears. Everyone present knew that something was wrong and was uneasy. The Soviet funeral music began to play, but stopped immediately because Kalinin said, sobbing:

"I report to you all a terrible piece of news about our dear comrade Vladimir Ilyich."

A woman in the corridor began to sob softly, and a wave of crying followed.

"Yesterday," Kalinin continued in a trembling voice, "yesterday he suffered another paralysis, and—" He couldn't go on, as if he had no strength to utter the heavy words below. Then he spat out the word "died" with all his strength.

The sentimental Slavic temperament immediately broke out. The entire hall was filled with weeping, softly and mournfully. Kalinin couldn't speak. With great difficulty, he waited for everyone to calm down before reading the public announcement quoted above.

Apart from his confidants, others did not know that Lenin was terminally ill. Even those who were with him on the day of his death felt that his passing was unexpected. It turned out that on the morning of the 21st, Lenin went out hunting with Bukharin and a few others. He did not hunt, but sat on a sledge and watched with his head resting on a pillow. In the past two weeks, his condition had greatly improved, and everyone thought that it would be beneficial to his health. He was in good spirits when he returned, but he looked tired. The doctor advised him to sleep. He ate a hearty meal around three o'clock and then went to bed. In his sleep, the third and last paralysis came, and he never regained consciousness.

Lenin's last words were: "Look at that dog." It turned out that when he was concentrating on watching the hunt, a hunting dog brought a bird to Bukharin who was standing beside him. Lenin raised his hand and said: "Look at that dog." He never spoke again after that.

### Strange Eyes

— Shi Shi

A certain sculptor in the south has eyes constructed like a microscope. He once carved the Eight Poems of Autumn Excitement and signed his name on a grain of rice, but although he could clearly see the tip of an autumn hair, he could not see ordinary objects even when they were only a foot away from him.

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 6: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (39)

Qiwan said: "Father got sick this time entirely because of me. He was worried about us coming out, afraid that something would happen to us. When he left, he repeatedly told me, gave me many business cards, and asked me to visit many people, meaning to ask people to take care of us. It can be seen how worried the old man was about us coming out this time. Last time, I received a letter from my eldest sister, which only said that the family was safe and that Father was also quite healthy. He disliked the lack of quiet at home and moved to a hotel in Shefansi. He didn't mention Father's illness at all, so I felt suspicious. But I didn't expect Father to be so ill, and the family was still hiding it from us. How can I be worthy of my father!" Saying this, she cried again. Although Hezhou comforted Qiwan, he was also heartbroken, and tears streamed down his face. Qiwan cried for a while, took out a stack of banknotes, handed them to Hezhou and said: "Brother, take this money back. This is the money that I slowly saved from 'small shares'. Take it back. If Father's illness has a chance of recovery, this money can help with medical expenses. In case of an accident, all kinds of expenses will be even greater. It's good to have it for emergencies." Speaking of this, the brother and sister hugged each other and cried again. Finally, Hezhou stopped crying and said: "I hope the old man will be blessed by the Buddha and turn danger into safety! I will rush back early tomorrow morning. Because of the contract, don't lose heart. You still have to sing hard and protect our reputation." Qiwan said: "How can I have the mood to sing?" Hezhou said: "This is related to our future. You can't help but grit your teeth and do it!" Qiwan cried: "This bowl of rice in the opera industry can't be eaten. After this contract is over, I will change careers and never sing opera again!" Saying this, she cried again. That night, the brother and sister talked and cried, and didn't sleep all night. The next day, Qiwan looked in the mirror, and her eyes were red and swollen. She said to Hezhou: "Brother, I can't go to the station to see you off. When you get to Peiping, send a telegram first, so I can feel relieved!" Hezhou agreed one by one. That day, he took the express train back. When he arrived in Peiping, he took a rickshaw from the station back home. As the rickshaw pulled into the alley, he saw from afar that a shed was set up in his yard. A wave of sadness surged in his heart, and he assumed that his father was no longer in this world and that the family had set up a mourning shed to handle the funeral. When the rickshaw got closer, he saw that it was the canopy of the neighbor's house. He hurriedly got out of the rickshaw and rushed home. His father was lying in bed, already on the verge of death, but his mind was still clear. Hezhou leaned over the bed and called "Father" several times. He gasped and barely replied, reaching out to hold Hezhou's hand, and said shortly: "Child, you're back, good, good!" He barely opened his lifeless eyes and looked at the bed, and said: "Child, where's your sister? Qiwan, Qiwan!" He only said these few words and fell into a coma again. It lasted until seven o'clock the next morning, when this generation of famous actors opened his eyes, looked at his children kneeling around the bed, showed a reluctant look, and left his children behind, passing away. Hezhou cried for a while and hurriedly prepared for the funeral, and sent a telegram to notify Qiwan. Qiwan suffered a sudden disaster and asked Guo Fang for leave. The theater had to agree out of human kindness, only requiring that she come back immediately after the funeral in Peiping was over, no matter what, the situation here relied on her to maintain it, and sent a generous gift.

### Yue Fei's Poems

— Zheng Guoyi

The Collection of Yue Zhongwu Wang, published in bookstores, was compiled by people of the Qing Dynasty, and mostly collected from the Jintuo Cuibian, which is not exhaustive. And its preface takes the posthumous title of Wumu as Yue Fei's special honor, as if no one before and after was given the posthumous title of Wumu to compete with Yue Fei. This is even more inappropriate. Yue Fei's initial posthumous title was Wumu, and his posthumous title was changed to Zhongwu, which is better than Wumu. It is appropriate to mention Zhongwu, not to quibble about Wumu. Moreover, in ancient times, Li Guangbi of the Tang Dynasty was given the posthumous title of Wumu, and Liu Qi, who lived at the same time as Fei, was also given this title. Is it only Yue Fei who received this posthumous title? With such a superficial view, no wonder their collection is not extensive. Among the articles in the collection that can be passed down, only the Ci of Man Jiang Hong is most popular. But the Bintui Lu records: "In the Gui Chou year of Shaoxing, Yue Wumu led troops to pacify the bandits in Qianji Fa. On the way out of Xin'gan, he inscribed a poem on the wall of the Xiaosi Temple in Qingni City, saying: Heroic spirit towers to the sky, I vow to repay the emperor with integrity, Slay all the stubborn and evil to return the chariot, Not asking to be rewarded with ten thousand households. During the Chunxi period, Lin Ling (Zi) wanted to engrave it on stone, but he was dismissed and failed to do so. Now the temple is abandoned and the wall is gone. His grandson categorized the family collection, but unfortunately, he had no one to tell him." Although the poem is not as good as the Ci of Man Jiang Hong, it is generous and heroic. Zhongwu's life-long ambition and integrity are also fully expressed. The collection does not contain it, which is unavoidable regret. I have transcribed it to make up for it. According to Han (Shizhong) and Yue, both Zhongwu rose from the ranks of soldiers, and both were able to write poetry and Ci, which is also a wonder. (Although King Han has no special collection, his poems and Ci are repeatedly seen in the novels of the Song Dynasty.) However, the Ci of Han Zhongwu were mostly written after retirement, so they have a clear, elegant, and indifferent charm, which has masked the original face of the spirit of swallowing the Hu, and is completely different from the sadness and gratitude of Yue Zhongwu. However, it was not King Han's original intention. Every time I read his Ci, I can't help but sigh three times. Because I talked about Yue Zhongwu's poems, I have added this.

### New Methods of Curing Crime

— Ji Jin

The word "治" (zhì) originally had the meaning of "healing," such as in "治病" (zhì bìng, to cure an illness). However, judges have always "治罪" (zhì zuì, to punish) criminals, often simply administering retribution like "an eye for an eye," without delving into the reasons behind people's crimes and prescribing appropriate remedies to fundamentally eliminate the motivation for committing crimes. In fact, today's prisons tend to become "crime factories." Someone who initially goes astray is often influenced by hardened criminals who have no fear of the law, becoming bolder and more reckless. Once released, they become even more dangerous bandits.

Now, the American judicial system has widely adopted the opinion offered by criminologists: "Treating crime as treating illness." The results are worth noting. Here are a few examples. Although the cases are small, the measures taken by the judges are very meaningful.

There was a chicken thief who had been arrested many times, but after being released, he always "remained incorrigible" and continued to steal. Later, a clever judge helped him set up a small farm and told him to raise chickens. Once the chicken thief became a farm owner, he loved chickens as much as his own life. He not only became law-abiding but also became the most vehemently anti-chicken thief person in the area. He worked diligently and became moderately wealthy.

There was a car driver who often liked to drive extremely fast and was arrested many times for causing trouble. Later, he ran over and killed a child. The presiding judge told him to go to the morgue and take a good look at the child's bloody corpse. As a result, he changed his ways.

A woman sued her husband for treating her badly because he only gave her twenty dollars a month for expenses. The judge's ruling was that the husband's entire income should be temporarily deposited in the bank. Apart from the twenty dollars given to his wife, he himself was only allowed to use twenty dollars per month. As a result, the husband sincerely repented, and the couple reconciled.

Another woman went to court to sue her husband, saying that he often beat her and never went out with her. When the judge summoned the husband for questioning, the husband said, "Look at how ugly she is, yet she refuses to agree to a divorce. How can I not be angry?" The judge came up with an idea that perhaps only an American judge could come up with: he told the man to take out a sum of money and have the woman go to a beauty salon for a makeover! As a result, everything has been peaceful ever since. I didn't expect that Heng Niang in my country's *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio* would have found a like-minded friend in the legal world overseas!

### Visiting the Former Residence of Mr. Gui Youguang (Zhenchuan)

— Tan Zhengbi

I have lived in Anting for half a year. One reason is that it is the ancestral home of my family. Although I was not born there, when one reaches middle age, one cannot help but have a sense of longing for one's roots. Another reason is that it is where the great Ming Dynasty writer Gui Youguang (Zhenchuan) once lived. Every time I wander among the broken walls and rubble of the Zhenchuan Academy north of the town, I am always filled with a sense of reverence and attachment to this lyrical master whom I have admired immensely. With these two reasons, I unhesitatingly left the old residence where I had lived for more than thirty years and resolutely moved here.

The place where I live now is at the southern edge of the town, about a mile away from my ancestral home and Zhenchuan Academy. However, separated by only a single embankment, it is where Mr. Zhenchuan often lived and studied during his lifetime! It is the site of the Shimei Hall. The Shimei Hall was originally the property of the Wang family, the family of Lingchuan's wife, built during the Zhengde reign of the Ming Dynasty, "with hundreds of rooms, spacious halls, and extremely elegant." It can be seen that this building was quite grand. During the Jiajing reign, the Wang family declined and mortgaged it to pay off debts. At that time, Mr. Zhenchuan happened to be living and studying at his wife's family. After discussing it with his wife, because Madam Wang could not bear "the grief of wandering in the fields of millet," and Mr. Zhenchuan also loved its quiet location, they decided that he would repay the debt in installments and redeem it. West of the hall, there were originally some beautiful ponds, forests, rocks, and hills. There was also a pavilion on the hill, which Mr. Zhenchuan named the Weilei Pavilion, and wrote a record of the Weilei Pavilion, which contains the meaning of "people abandon, I take," escaping the world and transforming customs. Later, when his eldest son, who he was often with, died, he also built the Sizi Pavilion there. When we read the "Record of the Sizi Pavilion," and read "Wandering around, looking around, the long sky is vast, stretching my eyes to the clouds and apricot trees, there must be a day when I see my son coming back," we can imagine Mr. Gui's deep love for his son at that time, making us, hundreds of years later, still sigh and weep.

However, to say it is shameful, I have lived here for half a year, and I have always wanted to visit the former residence of the great writer, which is so close at hand and which I admire so much, but I have never realized it. Although it is said that for the sake of life, I cannot put down my pen for a moment, it is still close to abandoning it. Recently, "the cold wind is bleak, and the leaves are falling," I have been working at my desk all day long, hunched over, and suddenly I remembered the famous line in Mr. Zhenchuan's "Record of the Weilei Pavilion," recalling his situation at that time of "calling my son to drink wine and singing on the hill," I could not help but yearn for it. So I threw down my pen, put on my hat, and decided to go for a walk.

Going downstairs and out the door, facing the north wind, crossing the small bridge, and passing the Jingtian Bridge to the west, then turning back south, crossing a small wooden railing bridge, I arrived in the fields. Looking west towards the Yangtze River, except for the distant villages, the ground is flat, and only the withered yellow color can be seen. At this time, my heart was already filled with a sense of desolation. So, according to the Anting Town Chronicle, I followed the road to what is called the site of the Shimei Hall. But there were only withered bamboo and semi-forest, and no sign of wall foundations or pillars. It seemed that there had been no buildings for a long time. Even the Wanfu Bridge north of the hall, a three-section stone beam, had its connecting part on the other side of the river broken. Walking on the bridge, looking back, the view was desolate, and it was unbearable to look at it for long. Looking down at the broken beam, the stream flowed gently, but no fish could be seen swimming. At this time, the north wind was even stronger, blowing people down, so I stepped off the bridge and wanted to ask someone for directions. But this was the time for the evening meal, and there was no one around, not even the cowherds or villagers could be seen. Walking slowly south again, I unknowingly reached the highway. I looked back occasionally and saw several red walls interspersed among the white walls and black tiles of the town. Those were the famous temples here. Seeing these, I suddenly imagined that Gui Zhenchuan, a literary giant of a generation, whose articles were read and whose name was known by all those who inspected the schools, but his residence was not respected by anyone, and only a very few people even knew that he existed. It was not as good as the local gods of the land and fire, who were worshipped everywhere, and I couldn't help but feel indignant!

After returning, sitting quietly in the room, I pondered deeply: Almost all famous writers in history were frustrated in life and lonely after death. No wonder Mr. Lu Xun's will did not allow his own son to become a literary figure. Thinking of the words "literary figure," I couldn't help but be shocked. From this, I realized why most people in rural towns and villages only know to respect the gods of the land and fire and do not worship writers. Think about it: rural life relies entirely on land production, and the most important things for people's livelihood are food and work, and without fire, food cannot be cooked, and work cannot be done at night. The gods of the land and fire, who provide them with the most essential needs, naturally cannot help but feel grateful and respectful. Even if the articles of writers are beneficial to body and mind, and are said to be the spiritual food that mankind cannot do without, these spiritual foods, no matter how nourishing, have always been enjoyed by only a few people in the past and present. So, it is not without reason that Gui Zhenchuan, a literary figure of a generation, is not as loved by the local people in his place of residence as the local gods of the land and fire.

This article was originally intended to express my feelings of longing for the past, but it only expressed some shallow feelings. However, my indignant heart was calmed down by this.

### Saint Dijon Orphanage Appeals for Donations: Foreign Children are Crying for Food and Eagerly Awaiting Relief

The Saint Dijon Orphanage at 95 Shaoxing Road in this city, run by Western expatriates in Shanghai, houses more than 60 orphaned children of White Russian and other nationalities. Recently, due to financial difficulties, it is hard to maintain, so a fundraising committee was formed to appeal for donations from all parties. A reporter from this newspaper visited the orphanage authorities a few days ago, who stated: "Each of the orphans housed in the orphanage requires about one million French francs per month, so the monthly expenses required are at least 60 million francs. If we could obtain sixty philanthropists to donate one million francs per month on a long-term basis, the financial problem could be solved." At this time of severe winter, these homeless foreign vagrant children urgently need the relief of enthusiastic people, which is also a way to express international friendship. The orphanage's office is located at the Cao Zuo Shi Tang Sheng Accounting Firm in the Asia Building, No. 1 Wai Tan, Zhengdong Road, in this city.
