### Ambassador Zheng's Reply to Bevin's Note: Full Text Released by Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Hong Kong Government Should Be Responsible for All Unfortunate Incidents in Kowloon Walled City; Urging Britain to Accept Our Proposed Solutions

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Foreign Ministry Spokesperson announced on the 6th that, regarding the Kowloon Walled City issue, our country's reply to the British Foreign Office's note to us on the 24th of last month was formally delivered by our Ambassador to Britain, Zheng Tianxi, to British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 5th. The Nanjing Foreign Ministry also sent a copy to the British Ambassador to China, Steven, on the 6th. There have been no new developments in the negotiations with Britain for the past two days. The British Embassy also had no comment on the 6th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the full text of the note from our Ambassador to Britain, Dr. Zheng Tianxi, on the 5th of this month, replying to British Foreign Secretary Mr. Bevin regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident. The Chinese translation is as follows:

Your Excellency,

I acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's note of January 24, 1948, regarding the recent forced eviction of Chinese residents from Kowloon Walled City. I have read it carefully. As such, I, as Ambassador, have been instructed by the Chinese Government to reply as follows:

The Chinese Government must state that, regarding the jurisdiction of Kowloon Walled City, the Chinese Government has always insisted on its interpretation of the 1898 Convention Respecting an Extension of the Hong Kong Territory between China and Great Britain, believing that the convention clearly stipulates that China retains its jurisdiction over Kowloon Walled City. This interpretation is not only evident from the wording of the convention but is also confirmed by the provisions of various treaties concluded in the same year for the establishment of other leased territories. The principle of the policy adopted by the Chinese government at the time was to define a special area within each leased territory in which China would retain its jurisdiction. The application of this method was not limited to Kowloon Walled City alone. For example, Article 1 of the Treaty between China and Germany regarding Jiaozhou Bay, signed on March 6, 1898, and Article 4 of the Supplementary Treaty between China and Russia regarding the Liaodong Peninsula, signed on May 7, 1898, both contain clear provisions. Article 4 of the Russian Supplementary Treaty specifically stipulates: "The Russian nation, in accordance with the request of the Chinese nation, agrees to allow Jinzhou City to govern itself and to establish the necessary police force within the city."

Although the relevant clauses of the Convention Respecting an Extension of the Hong Kong Territory between China and Great Britain contain the phrase "the Chinese officials now stationed in Kowloon City" and stipulate that the exercise of jurisdiction by these Chinese officials should not interfere with the defense of Hong Kong, the so-called Chinese officials clearly do not refer only to the personnel holding official positions in Kowloon City at the time but also include their successors.

Furthermore, although the convention stipulates conditions regarding the defense of Hong Kong, it does not stipulate that Chinese officials must withdraw under any circumstances. On the contrary, the convention further stipulates that "the remainder of the newly leased territory shall be under the jurisdiction of Great Britain." From this provision, it can be inferred that Britain cannot exercise such jurisdictional rights in Kowloon Walled City.

Regarding Your Excellency's claim in the note that, except during the Japanese occupation period, the jurisdiction of Kowloon Walled City has been exclusively exercised by the Hong Kong government since 1899, I, as Ambassador, must cite several facts to Your Excellency, facts that Your Excellency is certainly already aware of. First, the reason why Chinese officials withdrew from Kowloon Walled City in 1899 and ceased to exercise jurisdiction in the city was purely due to being subjected to armed force. At the time, a protest was lodged. Second, since then, the Chinese government has not only never relinquished its jurisdictional rights in the area but has also strongly opposed any attempt by the Hong Kong government to seize this jurisdiction. It must be specifically mentioned that in 1946, the Chinese government formulated a plan to restore governance in Kowloon Walled City. The temporary shelving of this plan was purely out of consideration for maintaining friendly relations between China and Britain. It is recalled that the Governor of Hong Kong at the time issued a statement denying the right of the Chinese government to restore governance in Kowloon Walled City, and the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs refuted it.

After learning in December last year that the Hong Kong government intended to forcibly evict Chinese residents from Kowloon Walled City and demolish their houses, the Chinese government repeatedly urged the British Embassy in China to warn the Hong Kong government not to resort to coercive measures. At that time, the Chinese government was already deeply aware that such measures could lead to serious consequences. However, the Hong Kong government disregarded these warnings and insisted on its own way, implementing various coercive actions on January 5 and January 12 of this year, which is truly regrettable. On January 12, a large contingent of armed Hong Kong police officers, wearing shields, helmets, and weaponry, and accompanied by a large number of coolies, entered Kowloon Walled City and opened fire on the residents before even firing tear gas, resulting in injuries to several residents on the spot, including two seriously injured.

Therefore, the Chinese government firmly believes that the Hong Kong government should be held clearly responsible for all the unfortunate incidents in Kowloon Walled City. The government flagrantly took such provocative actions while bilateral discussions between Britain and China were underway to seek a peaceful resolution. This was the main reason for the deterioration of the situation, ultimately leading to subsequent incidents, such as the Shameen incident on January 16. From the Chinese government's point of view, it would be truly unfair to attribute the responsibility for the various unfortunate incidents in Kowloon Walled City to news reports or commentary.

The Chinese government also finds it difficult to accept Your Excellency's view that the Magistrate of Bao'an County should bear considerable responsibility for the Kowloon Walled City incident because he went to Kowloon Walled City for inspection. The Bao'an County Magistrate's visit to the city for inspection and to express condolences to the residents forcibly evicted on January 5 was merely the minimum action that a magistrate legally responsible for the administration of the city should undertake in the performance of his duties.

In addition to the facts mentioned above, I, as Ambassador, would also like to present another point of view, hoping that Your Excellency will give it equal consideration. To thoroughly understand the 1898 treaty on the Kowloon leased territory, it is necessary to recall the circumstances at the time the leased territories were established. At that time, the Chinese government, unable to reject the demands of the great powers to establish spheres of influence on the Asian continent, made only a minimum reservation. The method was to delineate a special area within each leased territory so that the local government could continue to exercise its functions. In other words, China, compelled by circumstances, only agreed to accommodate the military needs of the relevant powers without relinquishing jurisdiction over the areas. Today, Kowloon has become a vestige of an outdated system. Therefore, whenever the British government does not respect the Chinese government's minimum reservations regarding Kowloon Walled City, it is not difficult to imagine the unfortunate consequences that may occur.

In order to prevent the situation from deteriorating further, the Chinese government urges the British government to immediately accept the various solutions previously conveyed to Your Government by the Chinese Government through this Embassy and the British Embassy in China.

### Handover of New and Old Hebei Provincial Governments Today in Beiping

[Our Beiping Office, 6th] Chu Xichun convened a meeting of the heads of various departments and members of the Hebei Provincial Government at his residence in Beiping on the morning of the 6th. It was decided that the handover of the new and old Hebei Provincial Governments would take place at Tieshi Zi Hutong at 11:00 AM tomorrow. In principle, the Hebei Provincial Government will still be located in Baoding. However, until transportation between Beiping and Baoding is smooth, it will temporarily operate in Beiping.

Mr. Chu hosted a banquet for the heads of various departments and members at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.

### Hankou to Organize Purchase of Finished Products, Including 17 Types of Necessities

[Our Hankou Office, 6th] Director Lin Chong of the Gold Control Bureau flew back to Hankou from Nanjing yesterday. According to him, he has obtained approval from the central authorities to organize the purchase of finished products in Hankou, following the example of Tianjin and Shanghai. The scope includes 14 types of necessities such as rice, flour, cotton yarn, leather, paper, soap, and matches, as well as three types of finished products such as steel, cement, and machinery. However, the quantity purchased cannot exceed the monthly output of each manufacturer. The period for applying for purchase is set from the 7th to the 25th. After these finished products are purchased, they will be sold at flat prices in the future so that both production and consumption will benefit. The issue of industrial and commercial loans will be decided after the Lantern Festival in the lunar calendar. Furthermore, in order to completely eliminate the black market for gold banknotes, Mr. Lin has decided to reward those who provide confidential reports.

[Our Panyang Office, 6th] The Headquarters replied to the Tianjin Gold Control Bureau, stating that Tianjin should be responsible for the reasonable control of internal remittances for industrial and commercial loans in the Northeast. These remittances are by no means a source of speculative capital. Restricting internal remittances will affect the circulation of materials between inside and outside the customs, stimulate inflation in the Northeast, and fuel price increases, which is truly inappropriate.

### Ministry of Finance to First Allocate Three Months' Budget to Various Government Agencies and Units

[News from Our Office] Regarding the case of adjusting the salaries of civil and military personnel, according to the provisions of the budget and the actual method of adjusting salaries, the funds to be allocated to various government agencies should be allocated before the Ministry of Finance compiles and transfers the comprehensive austerity measures such as the downsizing of organizations or the merger of institutions and the elimination of redundant personnel. For the sake of expediency, the Ministry of Finance plans to wait for the appendix to the central government's general budget for living allowances for the first half of this year to be issued to the ministry and then allocate one, two, or three months in advance according to the budget of each government agency or according to the list of applications for living allowances and in accordance with the monthly reduction standards for immediate use. After the austerity measures of various government agencies are transferred to the Ministry of Finance, adjustments will be made after recalculation.

### Additional Budget Approved

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] At the regular meeting of the State Council on the 6th, there were reports and discussions on cases such as the additional budget. The details are recorded as follows: Report section: Approved by the Executive Yuan, 13 cases of additional operating expenses for five agencies, drawing from the second reserve fund of the 36th year, including 12 cases of ordinary expenditure, totaling 1,597,797,900 yuan; one case of operating expenditure, 436,070,000 yuan; Four cases of various agencies drawing from the post-war relief fund of the 36th year, totaling 7,870,000,000 yuan. Discussion section: The Executive Yuan's affiliated agencies have supplemented the budget for operating expenses and subsidies for the first half of the 37th year, totaling four cases, which have been approved separately. One case in the ordinary section is 2.5 billion yuan, and three cases in the operating section total 210 billion yuan, all to be drawn from the second reserve fund of the 37th year. The Ministry of Finance has compiled a plan for an additional budget for subsidies to public school personnel from the central government for the 36th year, with the ordinary agency portion being over 20.121 billion yuan.

### State Council Passes Implementation Measures; Reduced Issuance of Living Allowances to Government Agencies; Ministry of Finance Simultaneously Drafts Emergency Measures for Local Finance

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The implementation measures for reducing the issuance of living allowances to various government agencies have been revised and passed at the State Council meeting on the 6th. The principles and spirit are based on the principle of tightening government expenditures. The living allowances for various government agencies are calculated based on their existing number of employees plus 10% to 20% or so. This excess amount is stored on the one hand for use by various government agencies to increase personnel and at the same time used as surplus funds for the welfare of colleagues in various government agencies. Now that the salaries of civil and military personnel have been adjusted, the state treasury's expenditures are huge. In order to reduce expenditures, the excess amount will be cancelled first. Therefore, the main point of these measures is that vacancies cannot be filled, and there is no impact on the current expenditures of various government agencies. The revised text of the implementation measures is as follows: A. The issuance of living allowances to various government agencies will be reduced by a total of 10% in February and March of this year, which will be coordinated by the various competent authorities. How to handle it after April will be handled together when the second phase of living allowances is adjusted. B. Members of the Judicial, Legislative, Supervisory, and Examination Yuan, Senators of the Political Participation Council, judges, teachers, etc., are not subject to the above restrictions. C. Business agencies should strictly limit extra personnel and may not transfer business expenses to personnel expenses. D. Military administrative agencies will be handled in accordance with the first measure. E. Hereafter, various agencies may not add extra personnel.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] In order to reduce state treasury expenditures, the Ministry of Finance, in principle, makes each province self-sufficient, and the central government no longer subsidizes them. A total of emergency measures for local finance in the 37th year have been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. Once approved by the Executive Yuan, they can be implemented. The main measures are recorded as follows: A. The central government will no longer subsidize the living allowances of public school personnel in various provinces and cities in the 37th year. In principle, the central government will not subsidize provinces and cities except for remote and poor provinces. The subsidies for remote and poor provinces shall not exceed the amount subsidized in the 36th year. B. The original business tax of the county will all belong to the province. The loss it suffers will be compensated by dividing the land, tobacco, and alcohol tax. The business tax of the provincial cities will be divided equally between the province and the provincial cities. C. All business tax and land tax of the Yuan-controlled cities will be included in the income of the Yuan-controlled cities. 30% of the inheritance tax will be allocated to the Yuan-controlled cities. The central government will entrust the collection of land, tobacco, and alcohol tax and allocate 50% to compensate. D. Each province and Yuan-controlled city should generally reduce 30% of the number of staff members approved by the central government in the 36th year.

### Sichuan Divided into Bandit Suppression Zone, Implementing Wartime System

### Jian Guansan to Propose Issuing US Dollar Bonds to Have the Wealthy Pay to Offset the Budget

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] Legislator Jian Guansan stated that he plans to submit a proposal in the Legislative Yuan to issue 500 million US dollars in forced bonds to offset the current huge budget deficit and have the wealthy pay to assist in China's reconstruction. In an interview with a United Press reporter, Mr. Jian strongly criticized the government's reliance on US aid to balance domestic expenditures. He argued that when US aid is obtained in the future, it should be used exclusively for constructive projects. Mr. Jian strongly stated that China should learn from the example of France and issue bonds. These bonds should be allocated to the wealthy and forced to purchase. Mr. Jian, who is responsible for reviewing the budget, stated that he will soon formally submit this proposal. The fiscal budget has a deficit of over 37 trillion, which is equivalent to about 300 million yuan at the current open market exchange rate for US dollars. The budget includes over 26 trillion in normal expenditures (equivalent to about 200 million US dollars) and over 96 trillion in special suppression expenditures (equivalent to about 500 million US dollars).

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Government officials confirmed today that the State Department's $510 million relief bill for China is nearly complete and will soon be submitted to Congress for discussion, with the period stipulated as April 1 to the 15th month. This news was obtained from officials after the State Department restrained the Director of the News Bureau and other officials from discussing aid to China with journalists. It is also known that the National Advisory Committee approved it on Wednesday evening, despite the ineffectual efforts of several committee members to oppose it. As for the use of the $510 million, it is stipulated that approximately $470 million will be used by the National Government to purchase food and raw materials, and the remaining $30 million to $40 million will be used as loans to purchase machinery from the United States. Senior government financial experts also said that this bill may be a prelude to a long-term aid to China reconstruction plan.

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A spokesman for the National Advisory Council, the US financial decision-making body, confirmed today that the State Department has prepared a $500 million aid to China plan for review by the National Advisory Council.

### Chinese and American Representatives Agree on Methods for Handling American Relief Materials; Principles for Food Rationing in Five Major Cities Determined

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Materials held a joint meeting with American representatives Kilbright and Moore, among others, at 3:00 PM on the 6th to discuss the principles of distribution of relief materials and the detailed methods for food rationing. It was decided at the meeting that the principle of unified distribution of relief materials will still be maintained. A detailed plan for the distribution of relief food was also approved. The plan is tentatively set to be implemented in five major cities: Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. Citizens in each of these cities who are not within the scope of the government's in-kind distribution will be eligible for rationing. The rationing method will adopt a voucher purchase system, with each person eligible to receive 5 sheng per month, temporarily for a period of four months. This rationing plan will be officially announced once the wording has been sorted out. Chinese and American parties will also issue a joint statement on this.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Regarding the rationing of food to the people in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, the Executive Yuan previously decided to implement the principle and instructed the relevant ministries such as food, economy, and society to study the details. According to relevant parties, the entire plan has been completed and is currently being reviewed by the Executive Yuan. The relevant city governments have been telegraphed to submit citizen rosters and prepare all necessary items. It has been decided that the rationing will officially begin on March 1st. The rationing committees for each city will be established around the 20th of this month. The organization has been decided: one chairman (concurred by the mayor), one vice chairman (concurred by the director of the city's social bureau), and five groups: investigation group, storage and transportation group, distribution group, general affairs group, and audit group. City government employees will be transferred to concurrently work in each group. The materials for this rationing are allocated from American relief materials and include: rice, flour, staple food, medicines, daily necessities (kerosene, salt, sugar, etc.). Citizens with ID cards can enjoy this rationing right. Also, after the establishment of the rationing committees in the five cities, the original committees for the distribution of daily necessities to public school personnel will be abolished.

### Battle for Liaoyang Reaches Final Stage; Situation Tense in Yingkou and Anshan; Heavy Industrial Equipment Suffers Terrible Damage by Bandits

[Our Panyang Office, 6th] The Liaoyang offensive and defensive battle has lasted five days and nights. The bandits launched a fierce attack with seven or eight divisions. The bandit artillery fire was densest on the nights of the 4th and 5th, and many of the defending troops' fortifications were destroyed. This ancient city's battle for possession has completed its final actions. It is reported that Liaoyang County Magistrate Zhou Jian has been captured by the bandits. On the morning of the 6th, the air force flew over the city of Liaoyang and saw many bandit cavalry in the city, looting past the White Pagoda. It was seen that the railway station three Chinese miles west of the city still had National Army troops holding out. The general public is now paying attention to the next action of the bandits after Liaoyang. Also, 3,000 to 4,000 bandits have fled from Tanggangzi Station to the Anshan area. Another group of bandits, numbering about 3,000, has fled from Tianzhuangtai to the outskirts of Yingkou, but has not succeeded. Also, the bandits around Jinzhou, western Liaoning, have mostly returned to the Liaozhong area southwest of Liaoning.

[Central News Agency, Panyang, 6th] The Liaoyang offensive and defensive battle unfolded fiercely in the suburbs. The battle was especially fierce in the Mazhaizi Company in the southeast of the city and the Sauce Company in the northwest. With the close cooperation of the air force, the defending troops fought valiantly and repeatedly inflicted damage on the stubborn bandits. On the evening of the 5th, the bandits concentrated artillery fire on our positions, which continued all night. The fighting was still fierce at dawn on the 6th.

[Our Panyang Office, 6th] The "Iron Capital" Anshan is surrounded by bandits, and the situation is quite tense. The Yingtaoyuan mining area has fallen into the hands of the bandits, and the equipment that was repaired after the takeover has been damaged again. The Shoushan water source has been destroyed by the bandits, and Anshan is lacking water and electricity. All the coal has been looted, and the food and clothing problems of the 13,000 employees are serious. Cases of freezing and starvation have been heard recently. This is the true face of the bandits' disregard for the country's military industry and shows their cruelty.

[Our Beiping Office, 6th] The military announced: In recent days, the Communist bandits have been systematically destroying the Beining Railway. Fan Hanjie's army group has made the necessary arrangements and can ensure traffic. The Communist bandits in Hebei attempted to attack Baoding during the Spring Festival. The National Army will take the initiative to clear them out. The Communist bandits in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region claimed that they would attack Jianlin again with eight brigades. Mao Zedong convened a meeting in Fuping at the end of last month and returned to northwestern Shanxi after the meeting.

[Our Taiyuan Office, 6th] Peng Dehuai and He Long recently held a military conference in Xingxian and decided to gather a large army to attack Yulin again.

### People's Representatives from East Xinjiang Arrive in Beijing to Pay Respects to the Central Government; Delegation Leader Tells Reporter That Everything in Xinjiang is Stable and Progressing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Yao Le-Bo, the people's representative from Hami Prefecture in East Xinjiang, along with his wife, Yong Xiu, and the delegation consisting of Kang Sheng, Director of the Cultural Promotion Branch of the Hui People's Representative Committee in the region, Wan Yi-ti, a Uighur religious leader, and Za Leng-Du-Se-Ke, a Kazakh representative, arrived in Beijing by plane from Xinjiang on the afternoon of the 5th. Today, this reporter specially visited Dr. Yao Le-Bo to inquire about the political situation in Xinjiang. He stated that everything in Xinjiang is stable, and there are no communist bandits or saboteurs. In particular, the compatriots in Xinjiang are very grateful for the contributions of Director Zhang Zhizhong and Commander-in-Chief Song Xi-lian to Xinjiang. Yao also emphasized that political negotiations in Xinjiang are not hopeless. A-He-Mai-Ti-Jiang's attitude towards Director Zhang has not worsened, and everything in Xinjiang is still progressing. The plan to divide Xinjiang into administrative regions has long been drafted and is awaiting implementation. Their visit is specifically to pay respects to the central government, expressing their respect and gratitude towards the central government. Furthermore, the banner they presented to President Chiang Kai-shek was adorned with the four characters "Savior of the East," the one to Zhang Zhizhong was "Savior of the Northwest," and the one to Chiang's wife was "Light of Women."

[Another Telegram] It is learned that General Zhang Zhizhong may leave Lanzhou and fly to Dihua within a day or two.

### Chief of Staff of Xun Command Reports on the Actual Situation of the Dabie Mountains Campaign; Minister Bai Flew to the Capital from Hankou Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi flew back to Nanjing from Hankou at 4 PM on the 5th. He immediately met with the Chairman in the evening at 9 PM to report on the military situation of the communist bandits in Central China.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th] The Jiujiang Command held its first press conference in Hankou at 3 PM on the 5th, with Chief of Staff Xu Zushi and others reporting on the actual combat situation in the Dabie Mountains area.

According to reports, the achievements of the two-month battle are as follows: Since its establishment two months ago, the command has directed seven major and minor battles, as well as 105 smaller engagements, resulting in 16,300 communist bandits killed, 35,100 wounded, and 6,470 captured. It also seized 3,580 rifles and over 35,000 rounds of ammunition. Among these, the victories at Liulin and Queshan were the most significant. The former initiated the anti-bandit campaign, strengthening the morale of our troops, while the latter shattered the attempted southward escape of the Chen and Liu bandit gangs, setting a record for our army's victory this year, both of which are of considerable significance.

Regarding the movements of the bandit army, Xu continued by saying that there are approximately 100,000 communist bandits in the Dabie Mountains area. After our army's suppression, casualties have exceeded half of that number. Currently, only the Third and Sixth Columns, as well as a portion of the First and Second Columns, remain in the area, and they are mostly scattered and fleeing. They no longer control any county-level cities. The main forces of the First and Second Columns have successively crossed the Huai River northward to the vicinity of Xincai, seemingly intending to merge their forces and attempt to replenish their ranks for another struggle. However, our pursuing troops have completed new deployments and launched an annihilation campaign between Runan and Shangcai. Liu's bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and fled north across the Hong River in a disorganized manner.

Future War Situation

Finally, Xu optimistically discussed the future war situation, stating that the guiding principle for combat in this area is to prevent the bandit army from escaping east or south, while simultaneously clearing out the remaining bandits on the ground and forcing them to return to the mountains for concentrated annihilation. This principle has been largely implemented. Furthermore, the bandit army faces difficulties in replenishment, and their morale is wavering, while our troops have high morale and are able to automatically engage the bandits in a hunting-like manner. Therefore, in the recent battle of Liutiangang (near Huangpi), our army was able to annihilate over 200 bandits with a single week's worth of troops. With the completion of planned deployments by area, the encirclement and suppression of scattered bandits, controlling key points, will surely be twice as effective and completed on schedule.

### Who is Attempting to Sabotage Sino-American Friendship?

Thoughts on the Inaugural Speech of the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai

Mr. Cabot, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, who has not been in office for long, delivered his inaugural speech at the Rotary Club the day before yesterday. The full text of the speech has been translated and published in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. This is a rare, straightforward piece on Sino-American relations that we have had the opportunity to read in the past year!

In his speech, the U.S. Consul General clarified the United States' policy towards China and expressed his regret for any possible misunderstandings on the Chinese side. First, he explained that the United States does not neglect China and support Japan. Second, he explained that the United States' aid to other countries is never for selfish purposes. Third, he explained that the United States' policy is not motivated by imperialism. These are all things that we are happy to hear and deeply believe.

In the latter part of his speech, the U.S. Consul General expressed deep surprise that Chinese people "do not have much criticism for another foreign imperialism, which actually occupies part of China's territory and despises the Chinese government," and that they do not criticize the strong country that benefited from the Yalta Agreement through U.S. pressure at the time of the Yalta Conference. He was also surprised that Shanghai students marched and demonstrated for the Kowloon incident, which involved anti-Americanism. However, the U.S. Consul General finally observed with his wise eyes that such things occur between China and the United States because "a small group, a group of people disloyal to the country, has been found in the United States, frantically trying to overthrow our country and system. ... These lackeys of foreign despotism, of course, want to destroy the ancient friendship between China and the United States. Perhaps the cronies of this despotic country are also very busy in China." Therefore, he finally requested that "all those who believe in cooperation between free countries for the common good must always be vigilant against such slanderous rumors." The words of the U.S. Consul General can be described as to the point, much more refreshing than those decorated with diplomatic language.

As the Shanghai Evening Post editorial said yesterday, this speech should be read in its entirety, and every point is worth careful consideration. After reading it, in addition to sincere admiration, we would like to frankly state our feelings.

First, the long and deep friendship between China and the United States was built up after U.S. Secretary of State John Hay advocated the Open Door Policy, which curbed the conspiracy of the great powers to divide China at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Later, the United States first returned the Boxer Indemnity, which further enhanced the friendship. This has been a historical evolution of at least forty or fifty years. After this World War, the brave men of the two countries fought side by side. China especially received various kinds of material, spiritual, and technical assistance from the United States. As long as the Chinese people have a conscience, no one does not know that the Sino-American friendship has been solidified with blood and sweat and is more solid than before. The Chinese people, reading the books of the sages, value loyalty and forgiveness most, and hate those who are ungrateful. The United States has no territorial ambitions towards China and has always provided assistance during and after the war. How can such friendship be forgotten? Therefore, even though Marshal MacArthur has shown various forms of forgiveness to the Japanese pirates in Japan, and even though American business tycoons are advocating supporting Japan's restoration of its textile business in overseas markets, we still believe that the U.S. Consul General's clarification is genuine and sincere. However, are there any remarks in China that promote resentment towards the United States? Yes, that is only the opinion of the Chinese Communist Party and its followers. They often do this during the war, let alone after the war? They often try to take advantage of the opportunity of one or two American soldiers causing trouble after drinking to expand propaganda, as if it can form hatred between China and the United States. Such a boring act is originally not worth considering by knowledgeable people in China, but there are some American reporters who unintentionally use it, pay attention to it, and publicize it. Thus, it is transmitted to the United States, as if most Chinese people are "anti-American" there. For example, the U.S. Consul General was deeply surprised that two or three thousand students in Shanghai marched for the Kowloon incident and wrote "anti-American" slogans indiscriminately. In fact, thinking it through, it is laughable. There are no less than 100,000 students in Shanghai's universities and middle schools, and only such a small number marched, and according to eyewitnesses, only five or six people wrote slogans indiscriminately with asphalt. How can this represent the students' opinions, let alone public opinion? It must be known that this is the "masterpiece" of the CCP's deliberate attempt to destroy Sino-American friendship, and its "masterpiece" is nothing more than that!

Second, we not only deeply agree with the U.S. Consul General's denunciation of "this group of lackeys of foreign despotism" who want to destroy Sino-American friendship and his belief that "these cronies are also very busy in China," but also want to further inform the U.S. Consul General that the busyness of these lackeys and cronies in China may be even greater than in the United States. The American Communist Party in the United States is only using the "Trojan Horse Policy" to infiltrate various institutions and organizations to conspire to overthrow the United States' country and system, while the Chinese Communist Party has now brazenly and openly played the role of bandits in Chinese history. Not only are they very busy within China, but they are also more busy going to "this despotic country" to ask for instructions and listen to training, and busy contacting and communicating with the Communist Party of our friendly country, the United States, in order to echo each other and be loyal to their common "leader." However, we are puzzled as to why some Americans still have not figured out the true face of the CCP, and the reason is partly due to the deliberate or unintentional bewitchment of some foreign curious reporters in previous years. For example, in Yan'an, everything is clearly monotonous and there is no freedom at all, but some foreign reporters mistakenly believe that the CCP has established a free and democratic government. They do not know that in the communist bandit areas, anyone whose opinions differ from the Communist Party is called an "enemy of the people," "traitor," "KMT spy," or "fascist," and is not worthy of enjoying freedom. What a dictatorial politics this is! For example, the CCP is clearly communist, but some foreign reporters are still casually talking nonsense that the CCP is only a "land reform faction" and not a real communist party, and even covering up for them by saying that the CCP has nothing to do with that "despotic country." Things like this are endless. Sino-American friendship was originally not a problem, and the reason why it seems to be covered by a layer of shadow is mostly due to these schemers who create malicious slanders against the Chinese government and try their best to embellish and exaggerate the CCP, passing it through some foreign reporters and using their pens to add dark arrows to Sino-American friendship in an invisible way.

Third, we want to frankly point out that the one who is attempting to destroy Sino-American friendship is the Chinese Communist Party. However, the ones who are trying to save and strengthen Sino-American friendship in order to jointly "resist an unprecedented tyranny" should undoubtedly be the great politicians and far-sighted diplomats of China and the United States. It must be known that today's situation is already clear: this "despotic country" wants to use the Communist Parties of China and Southeast Asia to remove the power of the United States, Britain, and France in Asia. Not only that, but it has now used the concessions obtained through the Yalta Agreement to "occupy part of China's territory" in order to use China's Northeast as a stepping stone to invade the U.S. state of Alaska in the future. Mao Zedong said as early as the war in his booklet "On New Democracy": "China's revolution is part of the world proletarian revolution, and it needs the help of the Soviet Union." He also said: "Anyone who cooperates with the United States is a reactionary, and China's only international friend is the Soviet Union. Anti-Soviet and anti-communist is a traitor." Under Mao Zedong's instructions, the communist bandits have always carried out their strategy of betraying the government and opposing the United States. What a pity is that the U.S. authorities did not fully see this point at one time and forced the National Government to accommodate the CCP and participate in the coalition government. The result was naturally only failure. But even now, it still seems to be uneasy about the failure of this experiment, as if the National Government is not friendly enough, and therefore the aid to China loan is still in a vacillating state. We want to remind you: if only a portion of professional diplomats, such as Van Slyke in the past, harbor prejudices, only know how to pick bones from small eyes, and do not start from the big picture, quickly implement the United States' far-reaching aid-to-China policy, we are deeply afraid that the world situation will become more and more urgent, and time waits for no one. As for if Americans suspect why the Chinese do not have much criticism and condemnation of "another foreign imperialism," that is even more untrue. As long as you read the editorials of this newspaper, which has the longest history of seventy-five years, and the protests and demonstrations of general people's organizations against the forcible occupation of the Northeast, you will know where the true public opinion of China lies. Here, we would like to ask our American friends not to think that only newspapers that flaunt the Chinese road and call themselves democratic and free are China's public opinion! We sincerely hope that the Chinese and American authorities will jointly recognize the Communist Party's purpose of action in the entire world and deal with it in unison. Then, with mutual trust, there will naturally be mutual trust, and how can the long-standing friendship between China and the United States be destroyed by a small number of communist bandits?

### Flexible Measures for the Election of National Representatives in Henan Approved by the State Council; Official Announcement of the Results of the Legislative Yuan Election in Jiangsu Province

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The flexible measures for the election of national representatives in Henan Province have been approved by the State Council in the meeting on the 6th. According to the Election Committee, the election of professional and women's groups in the southern Henan Province was originally ordered to be completed in Gushi County before being compiled and announced. Only 47 counties in the province can legally hold elections. The number of votes received by the reported candidates was found to be inconsistent with the law. After separate investigations, it was found that 64 counties were unable to participate in the election. After repeated inquiries, the government replied that the remaining votes should be calculated after all counties electing according to the supplementary regulations have completed their elections, and combined with those elected according to law. Now, it is reported that the province's transportation is almost completely cut off, and it will be difficult to report the results of the county-level professional and women's group elections in the short term. The deadline for national representatives to report is approaching, and the list of national representatives needs to be determined urgently. If we wait for the province to clear out the communist bandits before all the counties electing according to the supplementary regulations have completed their elections, and combine the votes with those elected according to law, then the time may be delayed, and it will be difficult to suspend the case. In addition, the number of representatives from the province's farmers' associations, labor unions, and women's groups originally belonged to the provincial election. Now, most areas of the province have been unable to promote the election due to bandit disturbances. The 47 counties that can elect according to law do not reach two-thirds of the province's counties. It seems that the elected and candidates can be decided based on the votes of these 47 counties. The remaining 64 counties that cannot hold elections actually account for more than one-half of the entire area. Therefore, the elected representatives and candidates decided based on the election results should be re-elected after the situation in the province is calm, in accordance with Article 5 of the supplementary regulations. It has been submitted by the 19th election committee meeting of the district and reported to the national government for record.

Only the Legislative Yuan election ballots have been opened, with the following votes: Chen Xunxin 28 votes, Chen Bosheng 10 votes, Huang Shaogu 9 votes.

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 4th] The Legislative Yuan candidates Sun Qu, Zhou Xiaobo, and Ye Xiaohou held a tea party at the New Life Club at 4 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to receive reporters from various newspapers and report in detail on the fraud in the Legislative Yuan elections in the district.

### Re-election of Supervisors in Beiping City Required; Election Results in Ningxia Province, etc. Approved as Valid

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Regarding the validity of the elections of supervisors in Beiping City and the He and Er Banners and Ningxia Province, which were held in advance, a report was submitted to the State Council meeting on the 6th. According to the previous resolution of the State Council, the election period for supervisors was extended, and those who were elected without following this resolution would be deemed invalid. Now, the above three units have been elected, and regarding their validity, the Ministry of Internal Affairs believes that the advance election of the A and Er Banners and Ningxia Province does not conflict with the resolution of the State Council. Moreover, considering the transportation difficulties in the provinces and banners, and in order to avoid difficulty in convening future meetings, the elections are specially approved as valid. However, the situation in Beiping City is different and should still follow the resolution of the State Council and order a re-election.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The handling method for disputes in the election of supervisors in the first district for nationals residing abroad has been approved by the State Council on the 6th. The flexible measure is that representatives from each district vote at their respective consulates and send the votes to the Consulate General in Chicago for counting.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] It was reported earlier that a British shipping company towed three barges and twelve boats on the Shanghai-Hankou line, bypassing a certain customs office and establishing a new shipping company. When inquired about this, the responsible personnel of the Ministry of Communications stated that the Ministry has not received any reports, and the name of the newly established shipping company was not specified, making further investigation difficult. Furthermore, according to Article 3, Paragraph 3, Subparagraph C of the Maritime Law, a Sino-foreign joint venture shipping company must have two-thirds or more of its directors being Chinese nationals, and two-thirds or more of its capital being owned by Chinese nationals.

### Fleeting Days of the Old Year: Market Conditions in Various Regions

Beijing [Our Newspaper Beijing, 6th Dispatch] With the Spring Festival approaching in Beijing, prices are soaring. Businesses unable to pay off debts are ironically saved because of the festival, while public servants and teachers are having a hard time. Although it has been decided to issue January salaries based on the cost-of-living index, the official order hasn't arrived yet, so various institutions are still selling coupons and proposing to give out a portion of the salary. The reasons for the price increases include the influence from Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the 200 billion in new currency recently transported, which is also a stimulus. With slightly looser credit, speculators are already stockpiling goods in anticipation of making profits after the festival. The Beijing Municipal Government has ordered grain merchants to remain open during the Spring Festival and not to exceed pre-festival prices. Grain merchants are therefore frantically raising prices before the festival. First-grade grain is now 1.45 million per bag, and rice is 2.65 million per 100 catties. While prices of other goods are rising, beef is uniquely cheap. Pork is 50,000 per catty, while beef is still 30,000. Meat merchants say this is still due to the war, as the cost of feed is too high, and farmers are mostly selling their oxen to butchers. Business people say that business in Beijing is generally bad, and many businesses will close after the festival. Only trading houses and grain merchants are making money.

Suzhou [Our Newspaper Suzhou, 6th Dispatch] Business in various industries here has been generally worse than last year. This is because prices have fluctuated greatly throughout the year, credit is tight, and interest rates are high. Many find it difficult to make ends meet as the year closes. It is reported that Hualian Chemical Materials and Dye Factory has abruptly laid off half of its workers, causing disputes.

Wuxi [Our Newspaper Wuxi, 6th Dispatch] During the closing period of the year, the black market for grain is rampant here, and the rate of price increases is staggering. White japonica rice has reached 1.583 million, japonica rice 682,000, and yuan rice 696,000, creating unprecedented new high prices. Wheat is 1.63 million, white wheat 1.66 million, with bran rising to 30,000. "Warship" flour is 660,000, and soybean oil is 3.51 million. However, "Double Fish" yarn is 3.57 million, a drop of 80,000. The prices of all other imported goods are rising rapidly.

Shenyang [Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th Dispatch] There are recently more flights to and from Beiping. However, there are still many people flying to Beiping, and there is hope for increased air transport. Furthermore, prices are five times higher than in Shanghai and about three times higher than in Beiping and Tianjin. There is a widespread hope that the scale of remittances into the Northeast will be relaxed to reduce the extent of currency inflation in the Northeast region.

Hefei [Our Newspaper Hefei, 6th Dispatch] As the Lunar New Year approaches, prices are rising for all goods, especially cigarettes, which have seen the most significant price increases. Tobacco merchants are hoarding goods, hoping to make even greater profits after the New Year.

Xi'an [Our Newspaper Xi'an, 6th Dispatch] It is snowing again in Xi'an, and the end of the year is bleak. Many people brave the snow to buy and sell New Year's goods in the market. The entire Shaanxi Provincial Assembly Chairman, Zhu Shaozhou, is also donating twenty of his paintings of plum blossoms for a charity sale at the winter relief association, with a minimum price of 5 million per painting. The proceeds will be used as relief funds.

Luoyang [Our Newspaper Luoyang, 6th Dispatch] At the end of the year, the price of food in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang has increased by one-third, and the price of vegetables has doubled.

Chongqing [Our Newspaper Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] Yarn prices are soaring, exceeding 45 million.

Qu County [Our Newspaper Qu County, 6th Dispatch] Heavy snow has been falling here since the afternoon of the 4th, and it hasn't stopped for a moment. The snow is a foot deep, and transportation in the city and suburbs is blocked. The prices of grain and vegetables have both increased, with white rice reaching 1.35 million per stone.

Wenling [Our Newspaper Wenling, 6th Dispatch] It has been raining continuously for days, and there was sleet last night. It is snowing heavily today.

Chengdu [Our Newspaper Chengdu, 6th Dispatch] As the Lunar New Year approaches, the weather in Chengdu is severe on the 6th, and prices are soaring. The prices of goods for the Spring Festival are rising particularly sharply. All industries are closing for the holiday from the 6th, as usual, and the atmosphere of the New Year is strong.

### Measures to Improve the Treatment of County-Level Civil Servants in Jiangsu Province

Implemented with the Approval of the Provincial Government Committee

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 6th Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Government held its 25th committee meeting on the 6th, chaired by Chairman Wang. The following resolutions were made: The new tax rates for house tax and business tax will be implemented from January 1, 1948. For those who have paid taxes according to the new tax rates before January 1, the overpaid amounts will be allowed to offset the tax payable for the next period. The measures to improve the treatment of public servants and teachers in various counties and cities were approved. Based on a base salary of 30 yuan, the cost-of-living index will be calculated. The amount exceeding 30 yuan will be paid at one-tenth of the index. The cost-of-living index for various counties and cities is set at 65,000 times. The average salary for laborers will be calculated based on 12 yuan according to the above index, and will be implemented from January 1948. The method for collecting student fees from provincial, county, and private secondary schools in Jiangsu Province for the second semester of 1947 was revised and approved.

### Anhui Provincial Government Layoffs: Principles Already Determined

The various departments and offices of the Provincial Government will consider the workload and selectively lay off staff. All laid-off employees will receive one month's severance pay. If there are vacancies in government agencies, laid-off employees will be given priority for re-employment instead of hiring new personnel.

### Fujian Layoffs Temporarily Postponed

[Our Newspaper Fuzhou, 6th Dispatch] Since the Central Government ordered that provincial-level expenditures be subsidized by 70%, the layoffs in Fujian have been temporarily postponed. However, public servants are still receiving salaries based on the cost-of-living index. To remedy the situation, the Fujian Provincial Government will advance the payment of salaries for February and allow each person to borrow 1 million yuan before the New Year to supplement their holiday expenses. County-level personnel will be paid at 65,000 times their current salary, taking into account the financial surplus or deficit of each locality, and will be issued at 90%, 80%, 70%, or 65%.

Those who left Siam after December 8, 1941, and hold a residence permit or entry permit, must return within two years, meaning that those with residence permits or entry permits that expired within one year may return. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has instructed its overseas Chinese affairs offices to inform overseas Chinese returning to Siam.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Formulates Implementation Measures for Seizing Materials and Stabilizing Prices

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Ministry of Economic Affairs, on the orders of the Executive Yuan, has formulated "Implementation Measures for Seizing Materials and Stabilizing Prices," which will soon be implemented. The main points of the implementation measures are as follows: Expanding the scope of supply, comprehensively planning the supply of materials, and improving the supply methods. Regarding expanding the scope of supply, in addition to public servants and teachers having the right to supply, in principle, this will be extended to civil and military personnel, employees of governments at all levels, and popular opinion institutions at all levels. If there is a surplus, this should also be supplied to cultural workers, industrial workers, vocational workers, and the general public. Regarding the comprehensive planning of the supply of materials, this can be divided into three parts: Part A, food: The government will continue to carry out grain purchase and collection, protect grain sources, increase production, and improve grain transportation methods and capacity. Part B, cotton yarn and cloth: Thoroughly implement contract spinning and weaving, unified purchase and sales. Yarn mills with more than 3,000 spindles should be responsible for contract spinning, and cloth weaving factories with more than 30 looms should be responsible for contract weaving. The processing fees for contract spinning will be calculated based on the price of cotton, and the processing fees for contract weaving will be calculated based on the price of cotton yarn. The government will increase cotton production as much as possible and remove obstacles to transportation. National accumulation and speculative hoarding will be cracked down. Part C, fuel: In addition to designating the four major coal mines of Kailuan, Huadong, Huainan, and Taiwan to supply and manage them appropriately, the government will also increase supply sources. On the one hand, it is necessary to increase transportation costs, save on usage, and avoid waste. Regarding improving the methods, attention will be paid to fulfilling registration requirements, preventing fraudulent claims, and cracking down on the hoarding of various daily necessities. As for the distribution of physical goods to public servants and teachers, in addition to the allocation of three dou of rice per month to all central government employees nationwide, as decided by the State Council, the distribution of other items such as oil, sugar, and salt will continue according to the current methods without any changes. These measures were newly formulated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Executive Yuan considered the physical distribution measures previously formulated by the Ministry to be cumbersome and returned them to the Ministry for reference. The "Beijing Evening News" on the 5th reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs had formulated new physical distribution measures. According to responsible officials of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, this may be a misrepresentation of these new "Implementation Measures." However, the "Implementation Measures for Seizing Materials and Stabilizing Prices" are only partially in principle.

### Unifying Economic and Administrative Affairs in West Germany: New Constitution to be Implemented on Monday, Reorganized Economic Committee with Expanded Powers, Supplemented by Legislative and Judicial Institutions, Subject to Control by the Occupying Authorities

[Reuters Berlin, 6th Dispatch] The new constitution for the economic administration of the Anglo-American zone of Germany, signed yesterday in Berlin by the military governors of the Anglo-American zone, was published today. The full text is 2,000 words long and is divided into 13 articles. It stipulates that the reorganized economic administrative body of the Anglo-American merged zone will be implemented from Monday, February 9. This body will include an Economic Committee with 104 members, doubling the number of members of the existing Economic Committee; a parliament composed of two representatives from each state in the merged zone; an Administrative Committee; and several other institutions, including a Personnel Bureau, a Statistics Bureau, and a Legislative Advisory Bureau. The important Administrative Committee, which was the most criticized point of the original proposal by France and the state prime ministers to the Anglo-Americans, is listed in Article 6 of the Constitution. The Administrative Committee will have one chairman, elected by the Economic Committee, and must be approved by the parliament and the Anglo-American Control Authority. The chairman of the Administrative Committee may not be removed from office without a vote of no confidence passed by the Economic Committee and approved by the parliament and the Anglo-American Control Authority. The ministers of the Administrative Committee may not be removed from office without a vote of no confidence passed by the Economic Committee and approved by the Anglo-American Control Authority. The reorganized Economic Committee will be composed of all 52 members of the existing Economic Committee, plus 52 new members elected by the state parliaments, for a total of 104 members. The members will be allocated according to the proportion of representatives of political opinions, and each state must elect at least one person. The functions and powers of the Economic Committee include enacting and promulgating laws and regulations on the administration of railways, ports, maritime transport, inland waterway transport, interstate waterways, patent rights, customs stations, etc.; the administration of taxes and civil officials of the merged zone; and the exercise of similar powers over matters related to interstate highways, the production, distribution, collection, and storage of raw materials and food, gas, tap water, electricity, foreign and domestic trade, price controls, and subsidies that affect more than one state. The Economic Committee also has the power to decide on the priority of labor requirements. The Economic Committee may also approve the annual budget of the merged zone, with its income coming from customs duties, fees, transportation taxes, and profits from public enterprises under the control of the merged zone. Other income includes a portion of salary income tax and corporate tax, as well as funds borrowed using tax revenue as collateral. The merged zone will also establish courts, whose jurisdiction will be determined by the Economic Committee with the special permission of the Anglo-American Control Authority. Above these courts is the Merged Zone High Court established by the military government. The Economic Committee may also establish a procuratorate for these courts. When the Economic Committee is in session, it may order any member of the Administrative Committee to attend and answer questions. With the special permission of the Anglo-American Control Authority, the Economic Committee may also establish supervisory bodies to supervise the implementation of laws and regulations. The State Parliament is composed of two representatives from each state, one of whom may be concurrently the state prime minister, and their term of office is the same as that of the state government. Its functions and powers include: Drafting legislation within the powers of the Economic Committee, except for those related to tax revenue and appropriations; passing amendments or rejecting legislative bills passed by the Economic Committee that have not been previously approved by a comparative majority vote; approving the appointment of the Chairman of the Administrative Committee; and ordering the Chairman or any member of the Administrative Committee to attend and answer questions. The Chairman of the Administrative Committee has the power to guide and coordinate the exercise of their powers by the ministers and members under their jurisdiction. The Chairman or members of the Administrative Committee may propose legislative bills and issue travel regulations to the Economic Committee or Parliament. The orders issued by the Economic Committee and the Parliament have the effect of terminating the previous German Law Society, but the orders they issue must be approved by the Anglo-American Control Authority. The Constitution also stipulates that the Economic Committee and the Parliament should be established and exercise their functions and powers within 15 days after the implementation of the Constitution.

[Reuters London, 5th Dispatch] General Clay, Commander of the US Army, replied to the opposition of France and the Soviet Union, stating that the expansion of the Economic Committee's powers is only a temporary measure. When the British, American, and French zones are completely merged, or the four powers reach an agreement to complete the unification of East and West Germany, it should be revised.

### Britain and France Plan to Submit a Five-Nation Alliance Draft to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg: This Move is the Starting Point for the Road to Pan-Europeanism

[Reuters London, 5th Dispatch] Reliable sources say that after the draft proposal drafted by Britain, which will be jointly submitted by Britain and France to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to form a five-nation alliance, was sent to the French government for research last weekend, the French government has submitted a satisfactory reply to Britain. There are no major revisions to Britain's original proposal. The next step will be for Britain and France to jointly submit the five-nation alliance draft to the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg for research. The joint declaration issued by the foreign ministers of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg after their meeting in Luxembourg recently expressed their acceptance of the principle of strengthening unity with Britain and France. However, they clarified that they would wait to receive its formal proposal before giving any affirmative reply. Observers believe that the acceptance of the joint proposal by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will depend on whether the five-nation alliance can have an effective voice in the decision-making regarding the future economy of Germany. Whether this point can be specifically stipulated in the five-nation alliance draft treaty will have to wait until the United States, Britain, and France discuss the future of West Germany in London on February 19 before a decision can be made.

[Reuters Brussels, 5th Dispatch] British Minister of State McNeil today informally discussed the Western European alliance proposal of Foreign Secretary Bevin with Belgian Prime Minister Spaak in Beijing.

[Reuters Brussels, 5th Dispatch] British Minister of State McNeil said: "If we want to establish a Western European alliance, we must not only make immediate sacrifices, but also make major political decisions. Europe seems to have taken a new decision, which not only expresses that it will never accept the dictatorial system again, but also expresses that it has taken immediate steps to cooperate to prevent the occurrence of emergency situations or the progress of any dictatorial totalitarian system. This decision does not conflict with the United Nations Charter, nor does it necessarily conflict with the non-European missions in which European countries participate. This decision is not offensive, but only defensive. The principle of European unity has been proposed, but when it is applied, it will be technically very complicated and politically very restrictive, which will not only require the participants to make immediate economic sacrifices, but will also greatly exhaust the politicians. Perhaps this move is the starting point for the road to pan-Europeanism. Under pan-Europeanism, Europe will be greater than before." McNeil also revealed that the British government has proposed inviting the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to attend the British, American, and French summit to be held in London on February 19 to put forward their views on the future of West Germany.

### Three Nordic Countries Plan to Form a Neutral Group

[Reuters Stockholm, 5th Dispatch] The prime ministers of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are scheduled to meet here on Monday to discuss closer cooperation between the Scandinavian countries. One of the topics to be discussed at that time will be the possibility of the Scandinavian countries forming a "neutral group" between the Western powers and the Soviet Union. Swedish Foreign Minister Entern has informed the parliament that Sweden does not intend to participate in the Western European alliance plan proposed by Foreign Secretary Bevin. It is reported that before Entern expressed this intention to the parliament, the foreign ministers of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark had already agreed that the three countries would not participate in the Western European alliance and would only promote closer cooperation between the three countries. Observers expect this "neutral group" to be only a spiritual alliance, not a formal alliance treaty. The three countries are deeply afraid that the conclusion of a formal alliance treaty will arouse the Soviet Union's resentment, so they are unwilling to give the unity of the three countries a very formal form. So far, all attempts by the Scandinavian countries to establish closer cooperation, even customs unions, have aroused severe condemnation from Soviet newspapers, accusing them of intending to form a group hostile to the Soviet Union.

### The Socialist Party Recovers from the Division: The Japanese Cabinet Crisis Tends to Ease, Both Sides Agree to the New Supplementary Budget Plan

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] The Japanese Socialist Democratic Party suspended its work this afternoon to curb the division. The right-wing and left-wing members of the party have agreed to another supplementary budget plan proposed by Hiroo Wada, Minister of Economic Stabilization.

The left and right wings of the Social Democratic Party have unanimously stated that if the Democratic Party disregards and accepts Wada's plan, the party will withdraw from the cabinet.

### The New Economic Committee in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany will be Located in Leipzig

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 6th Dispatch] Well-informed sources here said today that the new economic committee to be established by the Soviet military in Germany will be established in Leipzig rather than Berlin, so that the organization will not be affected by the institutions of the Anglo-American zone and can be more independent. The Soviet military authorities will have considerable executive power in the committee.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 6th Dispatch] The "Daily Review," the official organ of the Soviet Union in Germany, published an article stating that the Soviet Union will oppose Germany's monetary reform for a long time until all of Germany's central financial institutions, including the central currency issuing bank, are established. Monetary reform, if not implemented on a national basis, will only increase the current chaos. Only reforms involving the whole of Germany can accelerate Germany's democratization and benefit Germany's economic recovery.

### Hull's Memoirs XIII; Copyrighted by the North American Newspaper Alliance; Compiled by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper; Got Everything Without Firing a Single Bullet

In August 1938, when the Czechoslovak crisis became urgent again, startling news kept pouring into my office. Urgent peace talks were mainly conducted between Britain and Germany. Walter Runciman, whom I had seen in Washington in 1937, had been sent by the British side to Prague to mediate between the Czechs and the Sudeten Nazis. At the same time, Hitler seemed to be preparing to invade Czechoslovakia.

Just before British Prime Minister Chamberlain left England for Germany on September 15 to hold his first personal talk with Hitler, the British Foreign Office suggested to Ambassador Kennedy that they would like the President to express an opinion on the development. At a press conference that day, I said, "The historic meeting held today by the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor is of course being watched with the greatest interest by all countries that are deeply concerned about maintaining peace."

As telegrams poured into the State Department from Europe and the tension increased, I repeatedly visited the President at the White House. At the same time, I often sent Undersecretary of State Welles and Assistant Secretary of State Berle to the White House to bring information and criticism. Ambassadors Bullitt and Kennedy called me almost every day.

Chamberlain went to Germany again on September 22 to see Hitler. As the British and French governments were putting strong pressure on the Czech government, forcing it to make concessions to Hitler, it became increasingly clear that criticism in American newspapers believed that Czechoslovakia was being sold out to Hitler.

On September 24, Kennedy called me from London, explaining that a split had apparently occurred within the British cabinet. He said that Chamberlain believed that "peace must be sought at any price," while some other cabinet members said that he was unwilling to "negotiate privately with Hitler again," and believed that they "will have to fight sooner or later." He said that Colonel Lindbergh, who had been deeply impressed by Goering's air force, had been invited by the British to consult. Lindbergh had reported to us that he believed that Germany could easily cope with the combined air force strength of all other European countries.

On that day, Bullitt telegraphed me from Paris, believing that we should make some efforts to maintain peace, and should make some gesture even if it is unsuccessful. He suggested that the President should call on the heads of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Poland to send representatives to The Hague to resolve the crisis, and that we should express our willingness to send representatives to attend.

The next day, the 25th, our minister to Prague, Karl [he was serving as Assistant Secretary of State when I entered the State Department] telegraphed a call from President Beneš, hoping that the President would urge Britain and France not to abandon Czechoslovakia, let it be destroyed, and bring a major conflict that not only involves Czechoslovakia but also involves the world closer.

The President and I have been discussing what action to take. The President was prepared to make his personal appeal to the prime ministers of the European governments concerned. My thought was: Although I am not opposed to making these appeals, I do not believe that the results can prove their significance. I told the President that I felt that the evidence we had received was so numerous and fully proved that Germany had armed itself to the extreme and was determined to carry out extensive aggression at all costs, and that Hitler could not be prevented from pursuing his plan unless the other side had sufficient military force or surrendered completely. This means that any step that does not have the appropriate military force to deal with Hitler must be of an appeasement nature and purely temporary.

I was deeply afraid that the result of the President taking overly enthusiastic steps would put us in the same appeasement camp as Chamberlain, and would sooner or later cause the same disgrace as Chamberlain. I thought that this kind of step might mislead peaceful countries into believing that we thought there was no other possible way. Furthermore, even if this effort were successful, it would be dangerous, because at that time these countries might think that the danger of war had passed, and that the large-scale military preparations necessary to deal with the inevitable German threat were no longer urgently needed. In my opinion, given Hitler's plans and determination, the situation was truly at a critical juncture. Another danger is that the more fervent appeals made to Hitler, the more it would enhance his already extremely proud self, causing him to think that no one dared to oppose him, that he was all-powerful, and that he could obtain everything he needed step by step. In addition, I have no confidence in any of Hitler's guarantees. The idea of ​​giving Hitler a large piece of important land and obtaining a guarantee from him seemed to me to be self-deception. Welles kept urging the President to move forward, but I kept advising him to slow down.

But the President believed Bullitt's statement that something should be done, even if it was unsuccessful. He said to me, "It doesn't hurt. It's okay to urge peace until the last minute."

Since the President had decided to make his appeal, we tried to choose the most effective moment to publish them. For several days, we were preparing drafts, again and again. Welles and Berle did most of the drafting, and the President himself was quite involved.

On the night of September 25, we made the final touches to the President's message. We tried our best to make the message as powerful as possible within the limits of the wording. Even after the final draft was agreed upon, the President made a few slight changes with a pencil. Then, at one o'clock in the morning of September 26, the President sent the same message directly to Hitler and Beneš, and through me to Chamberlain and Daladier. We also sent it to our diplomatic missions in Warsaw and Budapest, and instructed them to forward it to the Polish and Hungarian foreign ministries. Poland and Hungary deepened the crisis by demanding certain parts of Czechoslovakia.

The President said, "On behalf of the 130 million people of the United States, for the sake of mankind all over the world, I most earnestly appeal to you not to let negotiations break down, but to seek a peaceful, just, and constructive solution to the current problems.

"I earnestly say again that as long as negotiations continue, reconciliation of views is always possible. Once negotiations break down, reason will be lost, and violence will rise." Then we waited quietly for a reply. We did not have to wait long for three of the replies. On the same day, September 26, Beneš, Daladier, and Chamberlain expressed their complete agreement with the President's views and willingness to negotiate peace. These replies were immediately announced so that the public could be informed before Hitler's scheduled speech that evening. But Hitler's reply did not come, and this reply was what we were most eagerly awaiting.

Europe is mobilizing. Kennedy told me by telephone from London that the British government had assured France that Britain would support it if war broke out. At the same time, Chamberlain had notified Hitler that his demands - which Chamberlain raised every time he saw him - were unacceptable, but demanded continued negotiations. I asked Kennedy if the British believed that the French were well prepared for war. Kennedy could not give me a positive answer, but he said that the British, as they had always shown, felt that they could "get up in time," that they were ordering their fleet to be on alert at all times, and that they had already called up troops from the territories.

Bullitt telegraphed me that Daladier said he hoped that the time would soon come when a conference could be convened to organize a true peace in Europe; he thought that the convening of this conference should be initiated by the President.

Now, Chamberlain wanted to make a broadcast speech to the American people on the next night, September 27, but the President said no. He thought that it might cause misunderstanding if the British Prime Minister spoke directly to the American people.

Hitler's reply arrived on the evening of September 26. It was a lengthy condemnation of the Czech government, the Treaty of Versailles, and the League of Nations, ultimately placing the responsibility for war and peace on Czechoslovakia, not on Germany.

Now we must decide what the next step should be. Bullitt telegraphed to suggest that the President should send a second telegram to Hitler, asking him to agree to send a representative to The Hague to attend a conference, as Bullitt had previously suggested. He said that Daladier expressed "joy" over this idea.

Many other countries have sent messages supporting the President's appeal the previous day. On the afternoon of September 27, we sent instructions to our representatives to the governments of other countries, asking these governments to issue similar appeals to Germany and Czechoslovakia. Nineteen governments, seventeen of which were in Latin America, agreed to this suggestion.

I also sent a telegram to Ambassador Phillips in Rome, with a confidential message from the President to Mussolini, asking Mussolini to "help continue to strive for an agreement on the current problems through negotiations or other peaceful means, without resorting to force."

President Roosevelt decided to make another appeal, this time solely to Hitler. This appeal, drafted by Welles, was issued on the evening of September 27, suggesting that a meeting of countries directly related to the Czech dispute be held immediately in a neutral location in Europe, and stating that "continued negotiations remain the only way to resolve the current problems on any permanent basis."

As we were anxiously awaiting Hitler's reply, British Ambassador Lindsay came to see me at my request after sending us a copy of Chamberlain's recent messages to Hitler and Mussolini. I said to the Ambassador, "I am asking you to come to tell you that if the war, which is already very threatening, really breaks out, I hope your government knows that my government has no policies or objectives to replace Britain's existing trade in any part of the world. Regardless of what we do in order to secure the trade of many other countries, we have no intention of taking advantage of the adverse situation created by the war for British trade and Britain's participation in the war to seize its trade." The Ambassador seemed quite moved.

Then, on the afternoon of September 28, as the world situation was at a critical juncture, Hitler invited Chamberlain, Daladier, and Mussolini to meet with him in Munich the next day to seek a solution to the Czech crisis. The war was at least temporarily delayed.

As to whether the actions taken by the President caused this result, it cannot be said. There is no doubt that they had a considerable impact. On October 20, British Ambassador Lindsay brought me a letter from King George V to the President, replying to the President's invitation to the King and Queen to visit the United States when they visited Canada in 1939. The King wrote, "I feel I must say how welcome your intervention in the recent crisis was. I have no doubt they made a great contribution to preserving peace."

But to me, the Munich Agreement seemed to be only a temporary solution. There are two ways to maintain peace, either to confront Hitler with strength, or to surrender. Now, the latter is being adopted. Hitler did not launch a war because he got everything he needed without firing a shot. Now, Czechoslovakia is defenseless before him. He can wait for the opportunity and get it easily, like catching a bird on a branch in a cage. Britain and France retreated before him. Prime Minister Chamberlain's devotion to peace and his great efforts and personal sacrifices to seek peace, although wrong, had some heroic qualities, but to Hitler, this was a sign of weakness. So I believe that only a "temporary peace" can result from this step, as I told the French Ambassador a month ago. Chamberlain called it "peace in our time," but this time is short.

### Resolutions of the Emergency General Meeting of the Entire Flour Milling Industry: 280,000 Bags of Flour to be Expedited North Before the Lunar New Year to Relieve the Food Panic in Peiping and Tientsin

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fourth District Flour Industry Association convened an emergency general meeting of all members at the Central Trust of China Building at 3 p.m. on the 5th. Over 40 representatives from factories in Jiangsu, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai attended. Chairman Yang Guanbei reported on the situation regarding Representative Xi Debing and Ren Zhuoqun going to Nanking to negotiate the flour transfer to Japan with the Ministry of Food.

The factories of the Fourth District Association have been shipping flour to Peiping and Tientsin with only a reasonable profit margin, with no intention of exploiting the people of the North. Moreover, around the beginning of January, Tientsin grain merchants purchased a large quantity of low-priced flour in Shanghai, and the price of flour in Tientsin subsequently decreased. This proves that the re-export of flour not only did not contribute to rising prices but has in fact achieved the task of lowering prices. Furthermore, the Fourth District Association will take further steps to determine a reasonable price for the re-exported flour from each factory based on the market price and necessary expenses, and report it to the Ministry of Food for record-keeping, in order to help alleviate the food panic in the North.

In order to alleviate the food shortage in Tientsin, the Ministry of Food has approved the shipment of 500,000 bags to Peiping and Tientsin each month starting in February, with 350,000 bags to be shipped by the Fourth District Association and 150,000 bags to be shipped by factories in Wuhan. The quotas for Qingdao and Southern China will be determined separately. In the past, during peak seasons, the Ministry of Food approved the shipment of a total of only 400,000 bags to Southern and Northern China each month. Now, the amount has increased to 500,000 bags for Peiping and Tientsin alone, demonstrating the Ministry of Food's deep concern for the food situation in the North and its efforts to provide relief. However, the current period is a slow season, and the sources of supply in various regions are extremely scarce, making the increase in re-export volume practically difficult. Nevertheless, in order to uphold the intentions of the Ministry of Food and assist in alleviating the food panic in the North, the Fourth District Association will, despite the difficulties, be willing to reduce the local supply in order to ship as much as possible to Peiping and Tientsin, thereby demonstrating that the North and South are one family without any discrimination.

Regarding the method of increasing transportation to relieve the food shortage in Peiping and Tientsin, it was decided to expedite the loading of 280,000 bags, to be collected and shipped by Shanghai's Gongji Five Factory and factories in the interior of Jiangsu and Anhui. If the flour from the interior is difficult to transport to Shanghai in the shortest possible time due to drought, shallow water, or freezing, it has been arranged that the Ministry of Food will allocate 50,000 bags from the flour milled at the Gongji Five Factory as a temporary loan for initial shipment, to be repaid by the factories later.

For the flour shortfall at Shanghai's Gongji Five Factory, 50,000 bags will be allocated from the 100,000 bags of flour from Northeast China that have already been approved for shipment to Peiping and Tientsin to make up the difference.

Negotiations have been made to charter China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan vessel to load 104,050 bags, and Yixiang Company's Limin vessel to load 130,000 bags. In addition, the Taihe vessel will load a certain number of bags. All ships are expected to be fully loaded and shipped to Tientsin before the Lunar New Year. It is expected that after the three ships arrive in Tientsin, the price of flour in Peiping and Tientsin will drop, and the food panic in both places can be alleviated. All members expressed their approval of this and are willing to proceed with the implementation immediately, loading the ships and transporting them to Tientsin.

### Students Unanimously Deny Assaulting the Mayor; Tongji Student Unrest Case Re-investigated

### Flying General's Blind Wife with One Ear Taken Away; Accusation of Seduction and Cohabitation Against a US-Bound Staff Member

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Zhuo, a former senior instructor at the Air Force Officer School, recently filed a lawsuit with the District Procuratorate against Tan Yuehan, a Guangdong native sent to the United States for training by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, accusing him of disrupting his family. Yesterday, the District Procuratorate assigned Prosecutor Liang Yunshun to handle the case. The original complaint stated that the plaintiff, Wang Zhuo, and his wife, Du Qin, were married at the Shanghai YMCA on June 24, 1935. Their relationship was harmonious, and they had five children. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Wang served in the Air Force Pursuit Team and was wounded in an air battle over the capital. He was assigned to Kunming for medical treatment and appointed as a senior instructor at the Air Force Officer School. In July 1939, Wang was injured again in a flight accident and sent to Hong Kong for medical treatment. After recovery, he lost sight in one eye and hearing in one ear. In September 1940, due to the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, Wang took his family by boat to Kowloon and then returned to the mainland. He met Tan Yuehan on the boat. Seeing that Wang was disabled and his wife Du Qin was young and beautiful, Tan seduced her in every possible way. After arriving in Kunming, they often visited each other, and eventually had a physical relationship. Later, Du left home without permission and hired a lawyer to publish a statement of divorce. After persuasion from Air Force Deputy Commander Wang Shuming, they reconciled. After the victory, they came to Shanghai from Chongqing to live. Du and Tan still maintained a connection. In January 1946, Du suddenly left Shanghai. Wang inquired everywhere and learned that Du had gone to Tianjin, using the alias Li Xiuhua, also known as Daisy Tan, and was cohabitating with Tan Yuehan, residing at No. 4, Building A, Fengye Building, Zhengzheng Road, First District, Tianjin. Wang tracked her down to Tianjin and investigated at the Tianjin First District Police Station, discovering that Tan had been sent to the United States for training by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in October last year and was currently residing at 2538 Mackey Road, Santa Cruz, California, USA. Recently, he even sent a letter inviting Du to the United States. Wang, therefore, accused Tan Yuehan of seducing a married person to leave their family, cohabitating and committing adultery with them, and intending to transfer the seduced person out of the territory of the Republic of China, in accordance with Article 240, Paragraph 2, Article 239, and Article 242 of the Criminal Code. The District Procuratorate will hold a hearing in the coming days.

### China Textile Company's Sales Decision: Two Principles - Public Bidding or Issuance of Shares

Since the promulgation of the measures for the specialized sale of state-owned production to private enterprises, the decision to include the company in the sale category has attracted considerable attention.

Previously, there were more than ten applications from various parties for preferential purchase, and strict review methods were established. There are only two conditions under which preferential treatment can be obtained: only those who suffered losses during the war due to supplying military needs and have concrete proof, and those who are truly local products that were forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regimes and can provide proof. No other excuses can be made to request preferential treatment. Moreover, the preferential treatment requested is only limited to being allowed to purchase at the same price and conditions as the public auction, and there are no special favors. Furthermore, as of now, the Committee has not approved any unit to be granted preferential purchase rights.

### Russian Woman Dies Suddenly, Body Not Stiffened: Three Doctors Examine and Determine Possible in Medicine

[Our Newspaper] Recently, a mystery of a female corpse not stiffening has been widely circulated among the White Russian community in this city. The deceased, Madame Gretny Kof, [see picture] was forty years old. Several years ago, she divorced her husband due to disagreements. She then lived at 47 Groshi Road with her nine-year-old daughter and worked as a waitress in a bar on Avenue Joffre. Due to her desolate life and arduous work, she was often unhappy. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, after returning home from the bar, she suddenly suffered an acute illness, possibly due to some stimulus.

She died around 10:00 AM. Her body was placed in a coffin that evening and moved to the White Russian Church on Ting Lee Road. According to White Russian custom, the deceased must be placed in the church for three days to complete religious rituals. That evening, Dr. Chai Ke Lun was called to the church to issue a death certificate. However, when examining the body, he found that the woman's

abdomen was warm, and her limbs could still be bent. He was greatly surprised. Upon further examination, it was confirmed that she was indeed dead. At the time, Dr. Chai Ke Lun, considering the incident bizarre, was unwilling to issue the certificate hastily. He went to examine the body again the next day, and it was already cold and stiff. However, rumors that the woman was not actually dead had already spread widely in the White Russian community. The "Russian Daily" even published an article about it. The matter was reported to the president of the Russian Emigrant Association, Polo Kof, who, to clarify the situation, instructed his secretary to dispatch three other doctors, including Dr. Ochi Wei,

to investigate together. After detailed examination, the three doctors confirmed that she was indeed dead. The cause of death was determined to be sudden heart failure caused by a stimulus. As for the phenomenon of her abdomen not cooling and her limbs not stiffening within a short period after death, it is medically possible and should not be considered bizarre. The woman's body was buried at Hongqiao Cemetery the day before yesterday.

He identified himself as Lin Yongming and selected one piece each of qipao material and trouser material, worth over 5 million yuan. He instructed the shop to deliver the materials to the Taishan Insurance Company inside the Zhejiang Xingye Building. The shop instructed apprentice Wu Yirong to make the delivery. Upon arrival, Lin was already waiting at the entrance. After bringing the materials inside, he provided a check from Zhejiang Xingye Bank with the number 853406. Wu took the check to the bank to cash it, but it was returned. After returning to the shop and reporting the incident to the owner, the owner reported it to the Huangpu Police Bureau, who dispatched officers to investigate at the Taishan Insurance Company. Yang Peizhi, the person in charge, stated that there was no such person at the company. Subsequently, police officers investigated the address at the bank and learned that it was the Dahua Trading Company on the fourth floor of the Zhejiang Xingye Building. However, there was no such company there either. The suspect is currently being apprehended.

### Prohibition of Ships from Indiscriminately Sounding Whistles

The Ministry of Transportation believes that small vessels indiscriminately sounding their whistles while docking in ports or navigating rivers is extremely disruptive. If not strictly prohibited, it could easily lead to misunderstandings. The whistleblowing of ships for salutes and urging passengers to board are particularly unnecessary examples that should be prohibited. Therefore, two measures for the use of ship whistles have been promulgated: (1) When a ship is moving, it shall sound one long whistle to warn other ships to give way. (2) When a ship is entering a port to dock or is raising anchor in the river, it shall sound two long whistles. All national shipping administration bureaus have been ordered to implement these measures strictly. The Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau received this order yesterday.

### Woman Who Lived with a Japanese National Engaged in Repeated Litigation over House and Furniture; Administrative Court Dismisses Lawsuit

A woman named Huang Lianmei rented a building at No. 8 Renjili, Fuyou Road. She lived with a Japanese national, Songze Qingxiao. The household head was listed as Huang Lianmei. After the war ended, Songze Qingxiao was arrested and transferred to the Hongkou concentration camp. Huang took the opportunity to abscond. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Yimiao Branch returned the house to the original landlord, Tong Yuezeng, for his own residence. The furniture in the house was investigated by the branch and deemed to have been left behind by the Japanese national Songze Qingxiao. The property was sealed by the Japanese Property Management Office and entrusted to the branch for safekeeping. Later, Huang claimed to have rental rights to the house and ownership of the furniture inside. Regarding the rental portion, she filed a lawsuit with the court, arguing that the Yimiao Branch's decision was illegal. Subsequently, the Supreme Court determined that, although the plaintiff had a rental relationship to the house, there was no fixed rental period specified in the lease contract. According to the then-valid Wartime Housing Lease Regulations, the original landlord was entitled to reclaim the house for his own residence with proof from the local police. The plaintiff's appeal was dismissed. Regarding the claim of ownership of the furniture, the plaintiff, during the rental lawsuit, also filed petitions with the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Land Affairs, which were both dismissed. The plaintiff then filed an administrative lawsuit with the Administrative Court. The case has been judged by the Administrative Court, which has ruled to "dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit."

### Yu Tang Chun (50)

Su San was tightly held by Jinglong and understood everything in her heart. She sighed slightly and said, "My heart is like a tangled mess. You should rest too." Jinglong said, "It was okay when I didn't see you, but now that I've seen you, I can't let you go." Su San wanted to take her right hand to pull away his left hand, but it was as if it were growing on his shoulder. Hearing Jinglong say this, she couldn't help but raise her eyebrows and gently scold him, "So you're saying it would have been better if I hadn't come?" Jinglong said, "It's precisely because you're so good that I can't let you go even more. Good sister, just agree to me this once." Su San couldn't resist Jinglong's entanglement and finally gave in to him once more. As the old saying goes, an ounce of gold for a moment. The value of this moment of time was truly more than an ounce of gold! Helplessly, the beautiful dream had just come true, and the song was already urging them to part. At the time of parting, there were truly countless words of gold and jade that could not be expressed. Jinglong sent her downstairs and had not yet reached the entrance of the inn when he saw Xiao Jinge leaning against the door. When they came out, he greeted them. Su San's face turned red, and she patted his shoulder and said, "Xiao Jinge, tomorrow when the young master departs, I'll still need you to take care of him. You've done so much for the two of us, and I have no way to repay you. I'll just recognize you as my younger brother." Xiao Jinge said with a bitter smile, "How can someone like me have the good fortune to have a good sister like you? Third Sister, you can rest assured and go back. Tomorrow, after I see the young master off, I will come and inform you." As he spoke, he had already reached the entrance. The rickshaw was still waiting, and the driver was dozing off in the rickshaw. Xiao Jinge woke up the driver, and Su San said, "You all go in and get some sleep tonight so you can travel tomorrow." She got into the rickshaw, waved her hand inside the beaded curtain, and the driver pushed the rickshaw from behind. For a moment, the sound of the wheels gradually disappeared into the darkness. Jinglong and Xiao Jinge sent Su San away and returned to their room upstairs. They couldn't help but prepare for a while. Last time, Jinglong had nothing but silver. This time, Su San had picked out a few shirts and pants for him to change into on the way, and there were also a few taels of loose silver that she had put in his bag.

### The Silver West Lake

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 6th] A cold wave from Siberia struck the southeastern region of coastal areas, turning the gentle and beautiful West Lake desolate and cold. The sky helplessly produced a morning fog, thinly shrouding the bare trees and mountains. Tears turned to ice, and the surface of West Lake was almost suitable for skating. Therefore, this thin layer of mold lingered and refused to go away. On the day before the solar term Beginning of Spring, another heavy snow fell, thickly coating the scenery far and near with silver. West Lake became even more graceful and refined, winning even more elegance. In the Lakeside Park,

defying the wind and snow,

there were many people appreciating this beautiful scenery. Some were walking slowly, wearing raincoats, while others were skipping and running. Snowflakes were lingering on the long, curled hair of the girls, and boys were bringing cameras to capture various different scenes. Many male and female students were strolling along the Broken Bridge to Bai Causeway area, walking shoulder to shoulder and whispering softly. The winter plum blossoms of Lonely Hill were bravely blooming in the snow. Because of the constant stream of people going to appreciate them, Lonely Hill became unusually lively. Even more elegant people went to Zhongshan Park or the Sizhao Pavilion of the Xiling Seal Society, sipped a cup of fragrant tea, and appreciated the silver-clad scenery.

Concerned people were talking about how well this snow had fallen: "If it snows before the Beginning of Spring, it will surely be a year of good harvest." This year's

autumn harvest guarantee

had already shown a glimpse. People were naturally very happy, so there were many people taking flash photos and reciting poems and drinking wine. What is this? What is the difference between this and paradise? However, the domestic war and the recent continuous riots in Shanghai caused tension and frustration in the hearts of everyone in this quiet and peaceful paradise. Moreover, due to the impact of various factors, many people were poor and destitute under the pressure of severely high prices, living the life of street wanderers. Here, there was also the

Winter Relief

being launched. The government allocated 50 million yuan and also held charity sales such as movies, dramas, and calligraphy and painting exhibitions. It was said that movies and dramas could not attract much money, but calligraphy and painting exhibitions were said to have a little surplus. There were three major projects for winter relief: one was the shelter and porridge distribution center, one was small loans, and one was the donation of old clothes. There were five porridge distribution centers, and another one was to be added recently. The rice was allocated by the Tianmin Food Regulation Committee, and the porridge vegetables were donated by the Medical Vegetable Industry Association. The people in charge were local charitable people. It was said that about 6,000 people ate every day. Originally, it was intended that each Bao

report on the extremely poor,

who would then come to eat again, but later it was felt that everyone who came to eat porridge was extremely poor anyway, so it was not necessary to set up documents and to hide it from anyone. As long as they were poor, they could come and eat. The shelter was built temporarily using the accounts of the Xingzong, but as for who was eligible to live in the shelter, there was no statistics or investigation, and the shelter was built on vacant land, with only a cheap cloth awning, and no rice straw or cotton wadding. Who would want to come and suffer the cold? So the cloth awning was not hung up, but only placed in the porridge distribution center.

Small loans

were being guaranteed by the City Bank to borrow 100 million yuan from the Provincial Bank as loan funds. Each household could borrow 500,000 yuan. Each district investigated people who were capable of running a vendor stall but lacked capital, and then the city government sent staff to conduct on-site investigations before lending to them. As for whether or not they would repay, that was another matter. More than 20 households had already been loaned to. For the donation of winter clothes, 1,600 complete cotton clothes, as well as broken socks, rubber shoes, old clothes, etc., amounting to about 2,000 items, had been counted. The 1,000 cotton clothes had now been distributed, with the distribution targets also based on the Bao's investigations. Compared to Shanghai, this kind of winter relief naturally seemed much colder. Moreover, some long-term relief efforts lacked detailed investigations and did not pursue the effect of the relief, inevitably making people feel that they were being too "unconcerned with the harvest." Due to the "unconcern with the harvest" of winter relief, there were still many people in this heavy snow,

crying out in hunger and cold,

with no place to stay. There were many people with worried faces who did not know how to cope with this difficult situation. They were wandering around in the streets, but not for "enjoying the beautiful scenery," but struggling for their minimum survival. During the heavy snow, rice merchants thought of reasons to raise prices again, and the prices of goods in various stores also wanted to rise again, but other things were not as urgent as rice. The cloth shops and dry goods stores, which should have been bustling with activity, were instead deserted. Shoe stores and food stores also became desolate. Even the shops selling eggs and pork were unusually deserted because the

New Year's pig slaughter

prices were too high, causing most employers to spend effort to buy from the countryside. Only the Yan shopkeepers were beaming, not afraid that people would not come to buy his goods. This was a serious threat to the poor. In this year, there were fewer people doing good deeds. The giving of rice tickets and New Year's cake tickets was as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. So these extremely poor people could only weep in silence. At this time, in the scenic area amidst the wind and snow, which was praised as "paradise," did the people living in Hangzhou really have good fortune? No, half, or even more than half, of them were struggling and striving for their own survival! [Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng]

[Our Newspaper, Hainan Island, 5th] Commander Han Hanying of the Pacification Command believes that decadent customs have been increasing in recent years, the virtue of thrift has been lost, the people of Ya Ya have not recovered from the war, and the rural economy has been depleted.

### Establishment of the Peiping Art Museum – A New Peiping Opera Movement Actively Unfolds – Preparing to Perform in Shanghai This Spring

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 3rd Dispatch] Old opera originated in Peiping. Until now, most theaters in Peiping [actually not just in Peiping] still perform old operas. However, in recent years, old opera has visibly declined. Partly, movies and spoken dramas have drawn away its patrons, but the main reason is the inherent flaws exposed in the old opera itself and the poor organization of the performers themselves. People's demands for appreciating old opera are progressing, and old opera has reached a period of necessary reform. One of the aims of the establishment of the Peiping Art Museum is to reform old opera. This new Peiping opera movement is currently developing. The Peiping Art Museum was established on New Year's Day this year. The person in charge is Jiao Juyin, formerly in charge of the drama school in Peiping. Famous playwrights such as Liu Nianqu and Zha Qianglin are participating in the work. Their scope of work is not limited to Peiping opera; spoken drama [already started], film, music, and dance [not yet started] are all to be done. Here, I only want to introduce the new Peiping opera. The Peiping Opera Troupe is personally led by the museum director, Jiao Juyin.

Two Countercurrents The basic actors of the Art Museum Peiping Opera Troupe are mostly former drama school students, including Wang Jinlu [male martial role], Chuan Dewei [painted face role], Gao Yuqian [female role], Li Jinhong [female martial role], Shen Jindu [male role], Yin Jinzhen [martial clown role], and Li Yiche [twenty]. Originally, there were more people, but some could not withstand the oppression of some members of the National Opera Association, leaving only these few people.

A week ago, the Art Museum held a new Peiping Opera symposium. The participants included drama theorists and actors, chaired by Ma Yanxiang, the editor of the "Tianqiao" section of the Xinmin Bao (New Citizen Daily). The reporter heard at this meeting that the new Peiping Opera movement is encountering two countercurrents. One is a minority of members of the National Opera Association, who believe that new Peiping opera is "clumsy and crippled national opera." They said to the actors participating in the new Peiping opera: "If you join the new Peiping opera at the Art Museum, you will never be used by any troupe in the future." However, these second- and third-rate performers, who have had enough of the "star system," feel free in this new organization. Most of them were not moved and told the society about their past pain, which had a considerable impact on the general performers. Another countercurrent is the so-called old opera "reformers." What these people do is only change the lyrics, compose new tunes, and promote the "stars." They call it "reform," but in reality, it is a restoration of the old ways. Qi Rushan is pointed out as a person in this countercurrent, and he has had heated debates with Ma Yanxiang, Jiao Juyin, and others.

Road to Reform According to the theory that "drama is the performance of reality," Jiao Juyin and his colleagues are engaged in the new Peiping Opera movement along the following paths: Reforming the difficult lives of the performers and creating actors who work for art. Reforming the backstage organization. The personnel system and organizational administration of old opera are entirely for money, emphasizing fame and fighting for status. It is necessary to overthrow the managing sections that collude with the "stars." Choosing scripts from a position of serving the country, society, and the people. Establishing a director system. The director must understand and be able to apply drama theory. Constant practice.

Three Performances The Art Museum Peiping Opera Troupe's major play is the newly staged "The Peach Blossom Fan," which has been performed twice, a total of more than thirty shows. The box office has consistently been strong, and the income has been surplus, overwhelming the old play "The Peach Blossom Fan" that was staged at the same time. Commentators generally believe that it is successful and has laid the foundation for the reform of old opera. The second performance adopted a segmented curtain system, eliminated the transitions and facial makeup, and used lighting and scenery, all of which were very advanced. As a result, the actors also fully developed their creative talents. For example, Gao Yuqian, who plays Xiangjun, was beaten three times and performed three different expressions. Zhenli, who was originally going to marry Zi Kai, also changed to Yang Longyou forcing Zhenli to marry in the middle of the performance, according to the spoken drama "The Peach Blossom Fan." There are many other changes. In short, everything is realistic and reasonable, and it will not collapse due to the threats and inducements of the old forces. Its success is predictable.

### Rongs Murder Case Solved Within Six Hours

Local Grassroots Organizations Discover Bandits Intermingling [Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 3rd Dispatch] A shocking bloody case occurred in Rong City on the evening of the 29th of last month. Wang Xiangqiao, a student in the Department of Rural Reconstruction at West China University and the son-in-law of Xiang Chuanyi, the speaker of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, was riding in a rickshaw with his wife, Xiang Shufang, from the city to their private residence outside the city. Just after they had traveled half a mile outside the city, in the dark, a gunshot was suddenly heard, and Wang was killed in the rickshaw. However, his wife and the rickshaw puller did not notice until they had traveled another mile. They were immediately sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, but he died. After the incident, the Rong Garrison Command dispatched personnel to investigate in the middle of the night. According to the woman's statement, Wang had studied at the Central Military Academy, and recently a classmate from the military academy, Chuan Rongguang, had secretly told him that another classmate, Wang Hanfang, had harbored a plan to assassinate him because he had failed to borrow money from Wang Xiangqiao. The command immediately arrested all the criminals involved, Wang Hanfang, Huang Zhongchun, and Lan Xiwu, based on this clue. They all confessed without denial. The entire case was solved within just six hours. Huang and Lan are currently the heads of the Rong City Baojia (self-governance unit) and have been notorious bandits in the past, often taking advantage of their power to do evil. After the incident, public opinion in society believed that bandits were mixed in with the local grassroots personnel. No wonder it has been difficult to maintain peace for a long time. It is hoped that the government will thoroughly reorganize the Baojia personnel.

### Insufficient Salaries, Difficulty Raising Livestock – Living Immediately Plunged into Despair – Xiamen University Faculty and Staff Send Telegrams of Appeal

[Our Newspaper, Xiamen Dispatch] All faculty and staff of National Xiamen University recently sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Education, requesting that Xiamen University be listed in the second district with a cost of living index of 115,000 times. The reason is that Xiamen is an isolated island with no local products. The food supply depends entirely on external sources, and it is also a port of entry and exit for overseas Chinese capital. The price increase has always been a leader, topping the entire Fujian Province and also higher than Guangzhou. Now the ministry's order announces the cost of living index, with Fuzhou listed in the third district, Guangzhou listed in the second district, and Xiamen unexpectedly listed in the fourth district. This is inconsistent with reality and lacks fairness. Salaries are insufficient to support families, and living is immediately plunged into despair. They earnestly request that Xiamen be listed in the second district with a cost of living index of 115,000 times, based on the actual price situation in Qingdao, in order to alleviate their suffering.

### Inter-City Football Tournament: Hong Kong Team Roster Determined, Inter-City Selection Not Ideal, Chinese Alliance Team Very Strong

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] The Hong Kong Football Association's Inter-City Competition Subcommittee selected the Hong Kong team representatives for the Hong Kong-Shanghai Inter-City Football Tournament on the evening of the 3rd. It was originally scheduled for three matches between Hong Kong and Shanghai: the first, Shanghai vs. Hong Kong Inter-City; the second, Shanghai vs. Hong Kong Chinese Alliance; and the third, Shanghai vs. Hong Kong Western Alliance. The Hong Kong team selections are as follows:

Hong Kong Inter-City Team: Tam Kwan-kan (Eastern), Go Shan-nu (Joseph), Hou Yung-sheng (Star Island), Cheung Kam-hoi (Star Island), Fa Lau (Hong Kong), Lau Chung-sheng (Star Island), Chu Wing-keung (Star Island), Keane (Yen Ping), Tang Yi-kit (Bus), Chau Man-chi (Bus), Ho Ying-fen (Star Island). (Manager) McAulay, (Captain) Go Shan-nu, (Reserves) Rickey (Hong Kong), Tse Kam-hung (Eastern), Sung Ling-sheng (Star Island), Lai Siu-wing (Star Island), Chan Tak-fai (South China), Lee Shek-yau (Bus).

Chinese Alliance Team:

Tam Kwan-kan (Eastern), Kam-hung (Eastern), Hou Yung-sheng (Star Island), Fung Kwan-shing (Bus), Sung Ling-sheng (Star Island), Lau Chung-sheng (Star Island), Lee Shek-yau (Bus), Chan Tak-fai (South China), Fung Kam-cheung (Star Island), Tse Kam-ho (Star Island).

(Manager) Lui Sui-hung, (Captain) Fung King-cheung, (Reserves) Tsang Kai-wing (Police), Tsang Chung (Kitchee), Cheung Kam-hoi (Star Island), Chau Man-chi (Bus), Ho Ying-fen (Star Island), Tang Yi-kit (Bus).

Reviewing the strength of the Hong Kong team, the Hong Kong Inter-City team's lineup is not ideal. Fa Lau's selection as center back is a surprise, and the arrangement of the forwards is particularly incomplete. There are problems with the foreign player Keane's coordination with the Chinese players. Chau Man-chi is also not an ideal right inside forward. Tang Yi-kit only has the characteristic of "fast rushes." If Meng Yiliang can mark him tightly, there will be major problems with the forward's attack. Due to the inappropriate Hong Kong lineup, the Hong Kong-Shanghai Inter-City match has become evenly matched.

The Chinese Alliance lineup in the second match, except for two positions, is otherwise ideal. The Shanghai team may not be able to defeat this team. In the third match, the Hong Kong Western Alliance's strength is ordinary, and the Shanghai team should be able to win here.

### Implementation of Supplementary Measures for Cotton Yarn Spinning: Yarn Control Committee Has Submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Approval

[Our Report] The Cotton Yarn Control Committee's proposed implementation rules for contract spinning of cotton yarn have been repeatedly reviewed by the six district associations, who requested reconsideration. The committee convened a meeting with the heads of the six district associations to discuss the matter. It is now reported that the six district associations have drafted "Supplementary Measures for the Implementation of Contract Spinning of Cotton Yarn" and submitted them to the committee for approval. It is learned that the committee has submitted a formal request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions. The proposed supplementary measures are appended below:

The implementation rules for contract spinning of cotton yarn have been established by the committee. Because various factories have raised requests regarding the amount of cotton they can self-prepare for contract spinning of cotton yarn and the calculation of contract spinning fees, in order to show consideration, the following supplementary measures are specifically stipulated:

For rotation purposes in case of cotton allocation disconnection, the cotton which each factory has on hand as of the day before contract spinning begins is regarded as self-prepared cotton. If, due to disconnection, this cotton is used, the yarn spun from it will be exchanged by the committee for cotton at any time in accordance with the stipulated quantity, and contract spinning fees will be paid. If the committee has no cotton available for exchange, this cotton yarn may be transported to cotton-producing areas with the approval of the committee to purchase raw cotton for replenishment.

Cotton allocated by the Executive Yuan to cover the contract spinning fees that each factory should receive will be considered as each factory's self-prepared cotton.

Factories that export cotton yarn and cloth in exchange for foreign cotton must complete the exchange within three months within the quota stipulated by the Foreign Sales Committee. The foreign cotton obtained will be regarded as each factory's self-prepared cotton.

For each piece of cotton yarn spun under contract, the amount of cotton used will be 453 pounds of American cotton, in reference to the Executive Yuan's cotton allocation contract. The moisture content is 8%, and the impurity content is 0.5%. If domestic cotton is used, the amount will be increased proportionally based on the moisture and impurity content.

The contract spinning fees and profits that each factory should receive will be calculated using a formula developed by the Cotton Yarn Cost Review Committee, which will be organized by the committee in consultation with all relevant parties.

Before the above calculation formula is developed by the Cotton Yarn Cost Committee, all factors used in the calculation may refer to the cotton price and the ratio of various indices at the time of the Executive Yuan's cotton allocation contract stipulating 259.5 pounds of contract spinning cotton fees, and the percentage of contract spinning fees for 20-count cotton yarn stipulated by the Former Spinning Association in September 1947.

The contract spinning fees will be prepaid by the committee every ten days based on the number of contract spinning pieces in the previous month and the calculation formula, and the actual number of pieces completed that month and the difference in indices will be supplemented at the end of each month.

In addition to providing guarantees, contract spinning factories must also be mutually guaranteed by factories with similar spinning capacity. The dispatch of resident personnel may be temporarily delayed. If the contract spinning factories cannot fulfill their guarantee responsibilities, the committee may still dispatch resident personnel.

These measures will be implemented after approval by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and will be the same when amended.

### Cotton Yarn Registration Deadline Extended to the 14th of This Month

[Our Report] The Cotton Yarn Control Committee's handling of cotton yarn registration in the city was previously scheduled from January 29th to February 6th as the registration period, and relevant trade associations were publicly notified. Recently, relevant trade associations reported that the yarn counts used by various factories are numerous and inspection takes time, so cotton yarn registration certificates cannot be completed and submitted for verification and issuance within the time limit, and requested an extension. It is understood that the committee has approved an extension of the registration period to the 14th of this month and has publicly notified all parties concerned.

### Cotton Yarn Weakness, Downstream in Cloth

Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation saw reduced allocation prices for spun and constructed yarn and scattered selling by retail investors, with very few buyers. Asking prices weakened across the board. By the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell another 1.2 million yuan compared to the previous day, to 59.1 million yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns fell in unison, ranging from 200,000 to 2 million yuan.

Yesterday's cloth market opened with sluggish trading, and the industry felt dull. Customers were also inactive, and prices moved downstream. As a result, 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths fell by another 5,000 to 23,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, khaki fine twill and Shilin cloth remained stable, while the rest of the cloth market was weak.

[Our Report] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn yesterday as usual, selling a total of 279 pieces, equivalent to 539 pieces of 20-count yarn. 104 purchase orders were submitted, and 20-count Red Bee was sold for 34.2 million yuan.

Spot Cotton Soars

Industry participants held onto their goods and refused to sell, and the market supply was exhausted. The asking price for Lingbao reached 7 million, and the market atmosphere was extremely sharp. Later, as the yarn and cloth markets turned down, the trend softened slightly, and the final transaction price was 6.95 million.

### Rice Market Situation Chaotic

[Our Report] The rice market is scheduled to close for seven days starting today, and reopen on the fifth day of the New Year (the 14th). Retail rice stores will, as usual, close on the first day of the New Year and operate for half a day from the second to the fourth day, and resume full-day operation from the fifth day. During the Lunar New Year holiday for the rice market, the Social Affairs Bureau stipulates that the retail price of rice sold by rice stores must not exceed 1.6 million yuan per shi.

Yesterday, the rice market situation was chaotic. Those with goods were eager to turn them into cash and sold off their stocks. Those with ample funds, on the other hand, wanted to preserve their assets and purchased from the market. As a result, the price of the same type of rice ranged from as high as 1.8 million yuan to as low as 1.4 million yuan. According to Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, the authorities have decided to sell national rice when the market reopens, for at least half a month continuously, in quantities of over 150,000 dan. The selling price has been requested from the Ministry of Food by Ye Shifu, Standing Committee Member of the People's Food Allocation Committee, who has gone to Beijing.

### Sugar Rose Outside the Market

### Cigarettes and Soap Continued to Rise

Yesterday's cigarette market saw brisk sales in stores during the Lunar New Year holiday, and buying interest prevailed in the market, intensifying the upward trend. Ten-pack British cigarettes even broke the 40 million mark per case, reaching as high as 42 million yuan. Old Knife tobacco also rose by 1.6 million yuan, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes and 50-pack canned cigarettes all rose by amounts ranging from 1,500 to over 20,000 yuan.

Yesterday's daily necessities and soap market saw muted news about distribution, and sales were exceptionally brisk in local stores. Replacement demand was strong in the market, customers were actively purchasing, and large buyers were lifting prices, causing prices to soar. As a result, Gu Ben and Two Knife soaps rose sharply again by 120,000 to 130,000 yuan. Xiang Mao, Guanghua, and Beautiful soaps also rose by 50,000 and 120,000 yuan. Matches also generally rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brands rose by over 500,000 yuan.

### Chinese Stock Market Quiet, Situation Lingering in a Weak State

The Chinese stock market was forced to close for the Lunar New Year yesterday. There were large sellers off-market, and traders were delivering off-market transactions. Mid-way, the market was very weak. Small stocks showed greater stability.

At the opening in the morning, sentiment was weak. Off-market there were account audits, and the credit of exchanges was tight, leading to weakness. Yong Yarn opened at 720 yuan and 757 yuan. No. 71 and others were absorbed for immediate delivery, rising to 726 yuan and 762 yuan. No. 117 and others delivered for immediate delivery, and No. 45 delivered for forward delivery.

Forward delivery stocks all rose slightly. Off-market unlisted stocks also weakened due to tight credit.

### Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Weak

Government bonds also weakened yesterday. Unified C bonds opened at 69,000, with a high of 71,000 and a low of 57,000. They finally struggled at the 60,000 mark, with approximately 4 million traded.

Yisha opened at 550,000 in the morning, with a high of 565,000, and then hovered around 560,000. As a result, compared to the previous close, Steel and Telephone fell by 5%, while Yisha, British Alliance, Wheelock, Yibei, and Tram fell slightly. Paper and Cultivation remained stable.

Literature and History

### The Jin Shu in the Qun Shu Zhi Yao

— Hu Shih

The Jin Shu was re-edited in the 20th year of the Zhenguan era. At that time, Wei Zheng had been dead for one or two years. (Wei Zheng died in the first month of the 17th year.) Wei Zheng's official title when he completed the Qun Shu Zhi Yao was "Secretary-General, Duke of Julu." He edited the Zhi Yao in the early years of the Zhenguan era, approximately between the third and sixth years. (See the records of Emperor Taizong and the biography of Wei Zheng.) However, the Zhi Yao has two volumes of Jin Shu (volumes 29 and 30). This is, of course, not the re-edited Jin Shu.

After looking at Huang Shi's collected editions of various Jin Shu (Hanxuetang Yishu Kao), referencing the phrase "primarily based on Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu" from the biography of Fang Xuanling, and cross-referencing it with the current Tang-edited Jin Shu, I can surmise that the Jin Shu collected in the Qun Shu Zhi Yao is Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu. (Huang Shuang also collects the Jin Shu from the Zhi Yao, but titles it "Jin Shu Recorded in the Qun Shu Zhi Yao," listed within "Various Jin History Works.") Try comparing the biography of Liu Yi (of the Western Jin) from the Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao, with the biography of Liu Yi in Zang's book collected by Huang Shi, and with the biography of Liu Yi in the current Jin Shu; then compare the biographies of Tao Kan in these three books; and you can know that what the Zhi Yao collects is Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu, and you can also know that the current Jin Shu uses the most text from Zang's book.

The elegance and beauty of the Jin Shu's writing largely comes from earlier works. Among them, Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu can be considered one of the most important sources. Take, for example, Huang Shi's collected six entries from Zang's book on Ruan Ji, the writing of which is completely identical to the current Jin Shu. Also, for example, the over 300 characters of Wang Zhan's biography from Zang's book cited in Huang Shuang's collected Taiping Yulan 512 are completely adopted in the current Jin Shu Wang Zhan biography. These biographies were not collected in the Zhi Yao, but they can prove that the Tang-edited Jin Shu was indeed "primarily based on Zang's book."

Since we have determined that the Jin Shu collected in the Zhi Yao is Zang's book, and we also know that Zang's book is the main base text for the Tang-edited Jin Shu, it can be used to collate the current Jin Shu. Scholars who have collated the Jin Shu in the past have never utilized this Zhi Yao version. I occasionally used the biography of Jiang Tong from this version to collate the biography of Jiang Tong in volume 56 of the current Jin Shu, and immediately gained insights upon opening the book, so I carefully collated it and obtained an early Tang version of the "Essay on Moving the Rong"! I will give one example: Jiang Tong's biography says that he

was appointed magistrate of Shanyin. At that time, Guanzhong was repeatedly disturbed by the Di and Qiang peoples. Meng Guan went west to suppress them and personally captured the Di leader Qi Wannian. Tong deeply pondered the chaos caused by the four barbarians in China and thought that it was appropriate to stop it at its source, so he wrote the "Essay on Moving the Rong" (Song version, Palace version).

The Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao reads "appointed magistrate of Huayin," and "personally captured" as "captured alive." This is what I call gaining insights immediately upon opening the book. That Shanyin should be Huayin has not been noticed by any of the gentlemen who have collated the Jin Shu. Yan Kejun collected the Complete Jin Writings, and he had already seen the Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao. Therefore, in his short biography of Jiang Tong, he had already changed Shanyin to Huayin. However, he did not use the Zhi Yao version to carefully collate the "Essay on Moving the Rong," only noting that this essay appears in the current Jin Shu, the Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao, the Tongdian (189), and the Yulan (794). Among these four books, the Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao is the earliest, and it still does not avoid the temple names of Emperor Taizong and Emperor Gaozong. The following examples are all valuable:

"Essay on Moving the Rong" (Current Jin Shu) (Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao) All have failed to guide and lead by universal transformation.

All have failed to transform through the Dao.

Guide and intermix with the Chinese people.

Intermix with the common people.

The Yi and Xia both perish.

The Yi and Xia both suffer.

The scholars and commoners are accustomed.

The officials and people are accustomed.

It is truly appropriate to pacify them with ease.

It is truly appropriate to pacify them with quietness and silence and then pacify them with ease.

With people without grain.

With people without husks.

Govern them before they become chaotic.

Cure them before they become chaotic.

Now the common people lose their jobs, and some flee and rebel. Now the Jin people lose their jobs, and some flee and rebel.

Most of the examples here are examples of avoidance of taboo names. However, the original text of the eighth example, "Jin people" (meaning "Chinese people"), is much clearer than "common people."

### On the History of Nanzhao

— Xiang Da

A Brief Examination of Various Books on Nanzhao from the Tang Dynasty

(II)

Since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty established connections with the southwestern barbarians, the "Records of the Grand Historian" and the "History of the Former Han Dynasty" both have chapters on the southwestern barbarians, recording events in the southwest. Among those who wrote books specifically about the history of the southwest, such as Yunnan, was Yang Zhong of Chengdu with his "Biography of the Ai Lao." Yang Zhong's book is no longer extant, with only one passage quoted in the commentary on the "Biography of the Southwestern Barbarians" in the "History of the Later Han Dynasty," describing the eight generations of the Ai Lao Yi from Jiu Long to Hu Zhong. After Yang Zhong's book, Chang Qu of the Jin Dynasty's "Chronicles of Huayang" also briefly touched upon Yunnan. The books quoted in the "Taiping Yulan" include "Records of Yongchang" and "Biography of Yongchang Prefecture," as well as "Records of the Eight Prefectures of Southern China." The "Records of the Eight Prefectures of Southern China" is also found in the "Yiwen Leiju," and is a book from before the Tang Dynasty. Among them, Yongchang is one prefecture, and the "Leiju" and "Yulan" do not mention the other seven prefectures. However, it mentions Jiaozhi (Yulan 910) and the Qiong River (Yulan 791), indicating that the content of the "Records of the Eight Prefectures" was quite extensive. The "Records of Yongchang" mentions the King of Ai Lao (Yulan 358). The "Biography of Yongchang Prefecture" describes not only Yongchang Prefecture but also the three prefectures of Zhuti, Jianning, and Xinggu in eastern Yunnan (Yulan 791, 781, 556). These were all prefectures established from the Later Han to the Shu Han periods, and abolished after the Qi Dynasty. Therefore, the "Biography of Yongchang Prefecture" may also be a work from before the Tang Dynasty, and like the "Biography of the Ai Lao," is one of the oldest documents describing Yunnan.

After the Wei and Jin dynasties, the relationship between Yunnan and China gradually became estranged. In the fifth year of the Tianhe era of Emperor Wu of the Northern Zhou Dynasty (570 AD), the great general Zheng Zhuo was ordered to lead troops to pacify Yuejun, and four Ning prefectures were established in the area, corresponding to the Xichang area of present-day western Sichuan. In the seventeenth year of the Kaihuang era of Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty, Shi Wansui pacified the western Ning Qiang, advanced to attack the southern Ning Yi Jiao, crossed the two western rivers into Qulinchuan, and defeated more than thirty of their tribes. The two western rivers are the Erhai Lake, and Qu Wenchuan is present-day Zhancang. The Nanzhao name for Dache was also Shixian, likely related to Shi Wansui. By the Tang Dynasty, interactions with the southwest became increasingly frequent, and envoys traveled back and forth incessantly, leading to the creation of descriptive writings about the mountains and rivers. Such as Yuan Zi's "Yunnan Record," Wei Qixiu's "Yunnan Travelogue," Fan Chuo's "Manshu," Bao Pang's "Yunnan Bielu," and Xu Yunwen's "Nanzhao Lu," all based on personal observation and experience. They are first-hand materials for studying the history of Nanzhao during the Tang Dynasty today. Although the works of Yuan Zi and Wei Qixiu are no longer extant, a few fragments can be seen from the excerpts in the "Taiping Yulan" and "Zizhi Tongjian Kaoyi," allowing us to grasp their general outlines. Now, based on what is known, I will briefly examine them as follows.

The relationship between the Tang Dynasty and Yunnan first appeared in records during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. In the early years of the Xianheng era (around 670 AD), General Li Yi (written as Li Yizong in the "Old Book of Tang" and Li Yi in Luo Binwang's collected works) led troops to attack the Yaozhou tribes. Volume nine of Luo Binwang's collected works contains two documents from the Ministry of War announcing the defeat of the rebel Liu Nuoshe, Yang Wen, and Liu Lu in Yaozhou, and the defeat of the rebel She Mengjian, etc., in Yaozhou, which record this campaign. At the beginning of the Tianbao era, Yunnan rebelled against the Tang Dynasty and allied with Tubo, constantly harassing western Sichuan. By the beginning of the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong, Yimouxun of Nanzhao, distressed by the excessive levies of Tubo, was persuaded by the Qingping official Zheng Hui to have the intention of returning to the Tang Dynasty. At that time, the military governor of western Sichuan was Wei Gao, who then sent letters to invite discussion. In the ninth year of the Zhenyuan era, western Sichuan and Nanzhao reached an agreement; in the tenth year, Nanzhao defeated Tubo at Shenchuan. In the same year, in June, Yuan Zi of the Tang Dynasty was appointed as the envoy to invest Nanzhao, and went to Yunnan. Yuan Zi's "Yunnan Record" is a record of his experiences and observations during this trip. Tang people often regarded Yuan's work as the earliest writing on Yunnan.

Yuan Zi, courtesy name Deshen, was a native of Langshan in Caizhou. There is a biography in volume 151 of the "New Book of Tang," and he is included in the "Biographies of Excellent Officials" in volume 185 of the "Old Book of Tang." According to the "Nanzhao Biography" in the "New Book," during the mission in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, Yuan Zi was the envoy holding the imperial staff to invest Nanzhao, with Pang Qi, the vice magistrate of Chengdu, Cui Zuoshi, and Liu Youyan as adjudicators, and Ju Wenzhen as the pacification envoy. Yuan Zi and his entourage entered Yunnan via the northern route. A small note under Rongzhou Kaibian in the "Geography Treatise" of the "New Book of Tang" states:

"From seventy miles south of the county to seventy miles. Another four hundred and eighty miles to Shimen Town, which was opened by the armies of Yi and Han prefectures in the fifth year of the Kaihuang era of the Sui Dynasty. Then through Deng Hang Mountain and Saddle Wave, two hundred and fifty miles to the Apang tribe. Then through Mount Mengkui, one hundred and ninety miles to the Akui tribe. Then one hundred and eighty miles to Yuguanchuan, then through Bowochuan, one hundred and fifty miles to the foot of Jiejingshan. Then through Jingxikou and Zichi, three hundred and twenty miles to Tangmatun. Then two hundred and fifty miles to Tuodong City. Then through Anning Well, three hundred and ninety miles to Qushui. Then through Shigugu, two hundred and twenty miles across Shimen, to Qialong Station. Then sixty miles to Yunnan City. Then eighty miles to Baiya City. Then eighty miles to Longwei City. Then forty miles to Yangjuhua City. In the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, the court ordered Yuan Zi, a member of the Ministry of Rites, and Liu Zhenliang, an inner attendant, to travel to Nanzhao from here."

Liu Zhenliang was originally Ju Wenzhen, who changed his name to Liu after taking his adoptive father's surname. This is the northern route described in the "Manshu," known as the Shimen Route during the Tang Dynasty. The opening of the road by the armies of Yi and Han prefectures in the fifth year of the Kaihuang era, as mentioned in the "Geography Treatise," is also found in the "Manshu." Volume one of the "Manshu" describes the northern route in the "Record of Routes within the Yunnan Border":

"From Shimen Wai Chuanlu Wangkunchuan to Yunnan, it is called the Northern Route. From Qingxi Pass in Lizhou, passing through Qiongbu and Huìtong to Yunnan, it is called the Southern Route. From Rongzhou, ten days south to Shimen, there is an inscription from the early Sui Dynasty stating: 'On the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month of the fifth year of the Kaihuang era, Huang Rong, concurrently a supervisor, led the stonemasons of Yi and Han prefectures to chisel four holes in the stone, each one zhang deep, to build inclined beam gun towers, connecting Yuexi Prefecture and Jin Prefecture. This was likely the route taken by Shi Wansui during his southern expedition.' During the Tianbao era, Xianyu Zhongtong's troops entered the Naxi area via this route. Subsequently, it was closed off. Only in the past fifty years, in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, when Nanzhao achieved meritorious service and pledged allegiance, did the court send envoys to invest them, while the Qiongbu route was blocked by Tubo invasions. In the seventh month of that year, Wei Gao, the military governor of western Sichuan, sent the patrolling official and investigating censor Ma Yi to open the Shimen Route and establish post stations." (The quoted text from the "Manshu" is based on my annotated version of the "Manshu," with minor corrections to the Siku edition.)

The Shimen mentioned here is within the territory of present-day Dou Sha Guan in Yanjin County, Yunnan. On the left side of the road at Dou Sha Guan in Yanjin County, there is still a Mo Ya inscription commemorating Yuan Zi's passage through this place on his way to Yunnan, which reads:

"On the twentieth day of the ninth month of the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era of the Great Tang Dynasty, Ju Wenzhen, the Yunnan Xuanning Envoy and inner attendant, Liu Youyan, the adjudicator, Tutu Chengcui, the junior envoy, Yuan Zi, the Imperial Censor in charge of the Imperial Staff to invest Nanzhao, Pang Qi, the deputy envoy and Vice Magistrate of Chengdu, and Cui Zuoshi, the adjudicator and investigating censor, together received the imperial decree to go to Yunnan to invest Yimouxun, etc., as the Nanzhao. At that time, Wei Gao, the military governor, Shangshu Youpushe, Chengdu Yin, and concurrently the Censor-in-Chief, sent Ma Yi, the patrolling official and investigating censor, to lead the marching army to open the road and establish post stations. Therefore, this was inscribed on stone to record it. Inscribed by Yuan Zi." The inscription has eight lines, all in left-aligned standard script, except for the three characters "Yuan Zi," which are in seal script. Yuan Zi was a calligrapher of the Tang Dynasty, known for his seal and clerical scripts. His seal script inscription on the Tang Guang Ming stele is widely known, but his standard script is rarely seen. This inscription can correct many inaccuracies in the two "Books of Tang" and the "Manshu." Furthermore, I suspect that the so-called Shimen Route is the Five Foot Road that has connected Sichuan and Yunnan since the Qin and Han dynasties. Zhang Shoujie's "Zhengyi" commentary on the passage in the "Biographies of the Southwestern Barbarians" in the "Records of the Grand Historian" which states, "During the Qin Dynasty, Chang Er briefly opened the Five Foot Road," says:

"The 'Comprehensive Records of Prefectures' states that the Five Foot Road is in Lang Prefecture. Yan Shigu states that the terrain there is dangerous and narrow, so the road is only five feet wide. Ru Chun states that the road is five feet wide."

During the Tang Dynasty, Lang Prefecture was under the jurisdiction of the Rong Prefecture Protectorate and administered the seven counties of Wei, Tongle, Shengma, Tongqi, Xinfeng, Longti, and Quanma, corresponding to the area south of present-day Zhaotong, extending to Qujing and Luliang. Therefore, the Five Foot Road within the territory of Lang Prefecture mentioned in the "Comprehensive Records of Prefectures" is likely the Shimen Route; the Sui and Tang dynasties merely repaired it. Quan Zaizhi's collected works, volume four, contains a poem entitled "Sending Vice Minister Yuan Holding the Imperial Staff to Invest Nanzhao," which was dedicated to Yuan Zi when he was sent to Yunnan. The poem reads:

"The envoy star goes to the southwest, distant borders communicate tribute. Misty rains deepen the Bo road, the banner and pennant display Han ceremonies. The Five Foot precipice feels light on the journey, the waters cherish the clear dual streams. The upper kingdom bestows grace and favor, the foreign ministers follow ritual commands. The farewell hall lingers your chariot, and covers the virtue of a sage."

Because the Shimen Route taken by Yuan Zi and his entourage was the Five Foot Road since the Qin and Han dynasties, Quan Zaizhi's poem contains the line "The Five Foot precipice feels light on the journey." This can also serve as proof that the Shimen Route is the Five Foot Road.

The "Old Book of Tang, Biography of Yuan Zi" states that Yuan Zi "wrote the Yunnan Record in five volumes based on his travels." The "Art and Literature Treatise" in the "New Book of Tang" also records this book, with the same number of volumes. The "Art and Literature Treatise" in the "History of the Song Dynasty" does not record it, nor is it found in books such as the "Junzhai Dushu Zhi." The "Taiping Yulan" quotes two passages from the "Yunnan Record," which I suspect are from Wei Qixiu's "Yunnan Travelogue," as discussed below. Yuan Zi's book likely no longer existed by the Song Dynasty, so Sima Wengong did not cite it in his "Zizhi Tongjian Kaoyi." The end of volume ten of the "Yongle Encyclopedia" contains an account of Yuan Zi's investiture and the subsequent granting of the title "King of Yunnan," from Yuan Zi's departure to Tuodong to the completion of the investiture and return to Wuzhou, totaling more than a thousand characters. The writing is elegant, and the narration of events is extremely detailed. The "Nanzhao Biography" in the "New Book of Tang" also contains such a passage. This is very likely taken from Yuan Zi's "Yunnan Record"; this is the only verifiable trace of Yuan's book. Based on the "Books of Tang," "Zizhi Tongjian," "Cefu Yuangui," and the records of the "Yunshou," we can infer that Yuan Zi and his entourage were likely commissioned in the fifth month of the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, left Chang'an in the sixth month, Ma Yi repaired the Shimen Route in the seventh month, passed Shimen on the 20th day of the ninth month, arrived at Anning City on the 15th day of the tenth month, arrived at Qu Station on the 19th day, crossed Qianshechuan on the 21st day, arrived at Yunnan City on the 23rd day, arrived at Baiya City on the 24th day, crossed Dahe City and arrived at Yangjuhua on the 26th day, and performed the investiture ceremony on the 27th day. On the 7th day of the eleventh month, the matter was completed and they returned east, departing from Yangjuhua City, arriving at Shimen on the 24th day, and arriving at Rong Prefecture ten days later, on the 4th day of the twelfth month. The round trip from Rong Prefecture took approximately three months.

Nanzhao rebelled against the Tang Dynasty during the Tianbao era and returned to allegiance in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, a period of more than forty years. Yuan Zi's mission must have caused a sensation in Chang'an at the time, and many people must have written articles and poems to celebrate his journey. However, we can only find one poem of praise in Quan Zaizhi's collection. Zaizhi also has a preface to "Sending Yuan Youji Holding the Imperial Staff to Return the Juan," which begins by saying that the chieftain of the Juan submitted to the court this spring, and then talks entirely about Dianchi and Kunming, using Tang Meng and Zhuge Wuhou as metaphors. This preface is clearly about sending Yuan Zi on his mission to Yunnan, so why are the characters "Juan" mistakenly used in the title and within the text? The reason for this is unknown.

Thirty years after Yuan Zi's mission to Yunnan in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era (794 AD) and the subsequent writing of the "Yunnan Record," Wei Shenggui was sent to Yunnan in the third year of the Changqing era of Emperor Muzong (823 AD). Wei Qixiu accompanied him and wrote the "Yunnan Travelogue" in two volumes, a record of his experiences and observations during this trip. Chao Gongwu's "Junzhai Dushu Zhi," volume seven, "Pseudo-History Category," records Wei Qixiu's "Yunnan Travelogue," stating:

"Wei Qixiu's 'Yunnan Travelogue' in two volumes, written in the third year of the Changqing era when he accompanied Wei Shenggui on a mission to Yunnan, records the routes and distances traveled and the sights and sounds encountered. The preface states that the reason why Yunnan could be a problem for the Tang Dynasty was due to the opening of the Yi Yue books. If the area south of Qingxi Pass in Lizhou were completely abandoned, the border would be free from worry; otherwise, the troubles would be unending. When the Tang Dynasty fell, the disaster indeed originated from this. Our dynasty abandoned Qinzhou and did not defend it, and Shu had no border troubles. Based on this argument, Qixiu's words cannot be said to be false." The matter of Wei Shenggui's mission to Yunnan is not found in the two "Books of Tang," and neither Shenggui's nor Qixiu's books have been passed down. The "Genealogical Table of Prime Ministers" in the "New Book of Tang" states that Wei Shenggui, the son of Wei Dan of the Pingqi Duke branch of the Wei clan, was the prefect of Jingzhou and the sixth-generation descendant of Wei Jun. The "Yuanhe Surname Compendium" states that Shenggui was the son of Wei Jian; this is the same Shenggui who went on a mission to Yunnan. Wei Qixiu is not found in the genealogical table or the "Surname Compendium." Volume 348 of the "Taiping Guangji," under the entry for Wei Qixiu, quotes the "He Jizhi" as saying:

"Wei Qixiu was selected as a Jinshi, and successively held the position of Vice Director of the Ministry of Personnel. He served as the Deputy Military Commissioner of Zexi under Wang Fan and died in his official residence in Weizhou in the eighth year of the Taihe era, etc."

This Wei Qixiu was a contemporary of the one who went on a mission to Yunnan, so it is suspected to be the same person, but the details of his life cannot be verified. According to the "Records of Emperor Muzong" in the "Old Book of Tang," in the autumn of the third year of the Changqing era, "King Qiu Quan of Nanzhao presented gold, jade, and silk in sixteen varieties." The "Chronicle of the Tang Dynasty" in the "Zizhi Tongjian," under the entry for the autumn of the seventh month of the third year of the Changqing era, states, "Quan Li of Nanzhao urged the people of the state to request the establishment of his younger brother Zhao You." The "Kaoyi" states:

"The 'Veritable Records' states that on the day of Xin You in the ninth month, King Li Quan of Nanzhao presented his national credentials. At the end of the year, it was also stated that Nanzhao requested the establishment of Meng Quanli's younger brother Zhao You, claiming that 'Li Quan' was a mistake. We now follow the New Biography."

Qiu Quan in the "Old Book" is likely the same as Li Quan in the "Veritable Records." The "Nanzhao Biography" in the "New Book" states that Quan Longchen of Nanzhao was killed by Wang Calei, the Jiedushi of Nongdong, in the eleventh year of the Yuanhe era of Emperor Xianzong (816 AD), and his younger brother Quan Li was established. Li Xian, the junior supervisor of the Ministry of Revenue, was appointed as the envoy to invest and offer condolences; the seal was granted in the third year of the Changqing era. In this year, Quan Li died, and his younger brother Zhao You was established. King Qiu Quan or King Bao Lu Li Quan in the "Old Book" probably refers to Wang Calei, the Jiedushi of Nongdong, with Qiu Quan and Calei being different transliterations of the same name. And Wei Shenggui and Wei Qixiu's mission to Yunnan in the third year of the Changqing era was likely to bestow the Nanzhao seal.

Wei Qixiu's "Yunnan Travelogue" was lost after the Song Dynasty. The "Art and Literature Treatise" in the "History of the Song Dynasty" records Qixiu as Qi Mu, and Qi is also written as Ji. The "Yulan" quotes 23 passages from the "Yunnan Record," and the entries in volumes 919 on geese, 924 on rice, and 974 on sugarcane all mention Wei Qixiu. I will now transcribe them as follows:

"Wei Qixiu, on his mission to Yunnan, observed that outside the wall of Tuncheng, there was a large pond with willow trees drooping and providing shade, and the pond was full of geese and ducks." (919)

"When Wei Qixiu arrived in Yunnan on his mission, the country presented white rice, all brought live." (924)

"During the Tang Dynasty, when Wei Qixiu visited Yunnan, Liu Kuan, the governor of Huichuan, sent messengers to present sugarcane. The sugarcane nodes resembled bamboo, and after peeling it, it also had a sweet taste." (974)

(To be continued)

### Yin Zhu and Wang Anshi on the "Inspectorate"

— Qi Xia

Thanks to Mr. Hu Shi's research (see the Wen Shi Zhoukan of the Dagongbao), we know that the system of "inspectorate" in the Cao Wei and Sun Wu dynasties represents the existence of "secret service organizations" as early as seventeen hundred years ago. During the Northern Song Dynasty (in the eleventh century), Yin Shilu (Zhu) and Wang Jinggong (Anshi) had already criticized this system. Yin Zhu's "Collected Works of Mr. Henan," volume eighteen, "Memorial on Important Matters of State Affairs":

"I humbly request that Your Majesty adopt the warning of the Han officials against prying into private matters and learn from the drawbacks of the Wu ruler's 'inspectorate'..."

Also, volume two of the same book, "Rectifying Inquiries":

"Those who govern the country in previous generations either liked to hear about external affairs or considered inquiry as a sign of intelligence. Some reported on matters of the neighborhood, which were praised for their openness and considered exhaustive; however, there was nothing more harmful than those who slandered virtuous officials. Therefore, the disaster of the 'hook party' originated from those nearby, and the prison sentences based on informing originated from widespread listening."

Although this passage does not mention the inspectorate, the people who "slandered virtuous officials" refer to the inspectors. Later, Wang Jinggong also discussed this matter, and his argument was clearer than Yin Zhu's. "Zizhi Tongjian Changbian," volume 240:

"On the day of Wu Chen in the eleventh month of the fifth year of the Xining era,... Feng Jing said, 'The Fucheng Division has recently dispatched many investigators, and the people are quite uneasy.' The Emperor (Shenzong) said, 'The number of people is still the same as before, and the investigation is not excessive. Lan Yuanzhen is also cautious... These people were originally ordered to specifically investigate military matters. If the military strictly enforces the law of reporting and arresting, it can also prevent mutiny.' (Wang) Anshi said, 'It is not a problem to specifically order them to investigate military matters. However, if relying on these people to investigate external affairs, they may not avoid making mistakes. Sun Quan and Cao Cao used extremely strict laws, executing people at every turn. However, even when using the likes of Zhao Kui (should be Zhao Da)' and Lu Yi, they could still commit treachery and disrupt the government. Your Majesty is benevolent and does not bear to execute people, so how can you guarantee that these people will not commit treachery? Not to mention the sage kings of the Three Dynasties, even Emperor Gaozu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang did not do what Sun Quan and Cao Cao did. But clearly showing likes and dislikes, rewards and punishments, so that officials are loyal and trustworthy, and dare not lie or deceive, how can the affairs of the world be concealed and not heard? If trivial matters are not heard, what harm is there to the governance of the state? If you want to hear trivial matters, but instead lead these people to commit treachery, then the damage to the governance of the state is not small.' The Emperor agreed."

From the above quote, Jinggong clearly stated the nature and drawbacks of this system. He pointed out that Zhao Da and Lu Yi were precisely the "inspectorate system" of Wei and Wu.

### On Freedom of Thought

— Xuanxuan

The other day, I read an article by Jingwen Jun in this column, paying respects to Varga, the sanctioned Soviet economic authority. The article implied that Varga was able to be loyal to his views and unwilling to change his conclusion about the trends of capitalism due to political or other reasons.

The matter of Varga's sanctioning was first seen in "The New York Times" more than a week ago. The Soviet side has not yet denied it. Judging from the status of "The New York Times" in the press, the credibility of this matter seems undoubtable.

Given Varga's high reputation in Soviet economics circles, it is surprising that he has been sanctioned in this wave of purging Western thought. Especially in a country like the Soviet Union, given how much the Soviet authorities relied on Varga (who served as Stalin's economic advisor during the war), it is significant that he disregarded the interference of his superiors and insisted on his conclusion that capitalism would not experience a recession within ten years. Freedom of thought is unstoppable, whether in an environment of free thought or in an environment where thought is not free.

Here, we might as well cite another example to look at the attitudes of two kinds of thinkers.

Last September, there was also an academic debate in the Soviet Union (Varga's purge was probably carried out in this way). The convener was Zhdanov, a member of the Politburo, and the theme of the debate was Alexandrov's best-selling book "History of Western European Philosophy." Attending were a number of prominent figures in Soviet philosophy. What is strange is that Alexandrov was not an unknown figure. He was a member of the Central Executive Committee of the CPSU, had won the Stalin Prize, and was a first-class Soviet theorist. His "History of Western European Philosophy" became a problem because it praised the status of Western philosophy.

In this debate, however, Alexandrov did not act like Varga. He completely "admitted" his mistakes and was willing to "voluntarily" revise his theory, and so the storm subsided.

Here, we can see two kinds of attitudes of thinkers. One is persistent and loyal to his own theory, whose spirit of martyrdom is like that of the ancient Indian monks, and is naturally worthy of admiration. The other is submissive and compromises with politics, whose status is of course very different from the former. But here, I have a personal opinion: rather than blaming the fact that academia submits to politics, it is better to blame the system in which politics compromises academia. Alexandrov is indeed weak, but his fault lies only in his weakness, and the responsibility for harming academia must be borne by the environment that makes it weak.

People often blame the victims, while easily letting go of those who harm others. After the Munich crisis, the deceived Chamberlain was scolded more than the deceitful Hitler, which is really not fair. The vision of the common world often loses its sense of proportion and ultimately ignores the fundamentals of things.

Varga is certainly commendable, and Alexandrov is not without fault. For "History of Western European Philosophy," we can still respect its original state before it was "revised," but for the kind of atmosphere in which thought cannot be free, we really have to criticize it.

### Tojo's Secret

Here is a secret about Hideki Tojo, which perhaps Tojo himself does not know.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States was united in outrage. From then on, the most popular slogan was "Remember Pearl Harbor." Of course, the American soldiers who experienced the war were always mindful of it.

And now, Hideki Tojo has truly achieved the degree of "never forgetting until death."

The fact is this: One day, the US military authorities stationed in Japan suddenly summoned three young US Navy officers. These three people were all licensed dentists before joining the army. After these three officers reported for duty, the commander gave them the order: to go to Sugamo Prison to see a war criminal for dental problems.

When they arrived at the prison, they learned that their patient was none other than Hideki Tojo, the leader of the Sugamo Prison inmates - Tojo's dentures were broken, and he asked them to make him a new set of dentures.

These three officers, who could not forget Pearl Harbor, had an idea. A few days later, they sent the new dentures to the prison, and Tojo seemed very satisfied.

But he did not know that there was a neat row of small dimples on top of those dentures—if read according to telegraph code, it would be exactly one sentence: "Remember Pearl Harbor"! (Ruyi)

### A Democratic School

— Ze Shi

A month ago, when the cries for democracy were shaking the heavens and earth, as far as I know, there is one thing that best exemplifies democracy, and that is schools. The fact is, as reported in a news item from this city (Shanghai):

The Municipal Education Bureau announced that the city's national primary schools have not yet reached the standard of one school per district, and many school-age children wishing to enroll cannot all be accommodated. Therefore, the work plan for the 36th year of the Republic (1947) will continue to focus on establishing more national primary schools and classes, accommodating as many school-age children as possible, and encouraging private schooling. After a year of effort, the expansion of national primary schools has been limited by funding, failing to meet the expected target, while the number of private primary schools has increased considerably. This year, 38 national primary schools were added, enrolling an additional 22,718 students, and 330 private schools were added, enrolling an additional 53,000-plus students. In total, the city now has 321 municipal primary schools with 161,596 students, and 1,162 private primary schools with 232,014 students.

From this, we can see that private primary schools enroll about 50% more students than municipal schools. If the government continues to "be limited by funding" and continues to "encourage private schooling," in the near future, municipal primary schools will become as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, while private schools will spring up like bamboo shoots after a rain. According to the old saying, primary education is compulsory education, meaning the government establishes schools extensively and forces school-age children to enroll. Now we have changed to "voluntary enrollment," which is democratic wind number one. The government humbly admits to being limited by funding and encourages private schooling, which is democratic wind number two. This little bit of democracy is particularly valuable because, according to a certain British educator (unfortunately, not a Yan country one!), the most democratic education is to take education out of the hands of the state, because the state often uses education as a tool to achieve certain goals, just like the church in the old days.

However, people sometimes have rather strange temperaments. For example, regarding democracy, some places strive for democracy even at the cost of bloodshed, while other places strongly reject democracy, and if they cannot refuse it, they will cause a public outcry. The democratization of schools mentioned above, if public opinion could be widely solicited, the result would certainly not be in favor of it. The reason is not difficult to understand: municipal schools have low tuition fees, while private schools have high tuition fees, and nine out of ten people prefer the cheaper option because they are poor. From this point of view, the more private schools there are, the fewer children will be able to attend. Therefore, it is said that the democratic wind in schools (especially primary schools) should not be encouraged.

I do not want to blame the wise: the government always finds ways to fund other expenses, such as gasoline costs, tea and refreshments, and the cost of repairing doors, windows, and tables damaged by dancing girls, but why is it that only funding for primary education is always "limited"? I only want to suggest: instead of encouraging private schooling, it is better to move towards joint public-private management. If funding is "limited," taxes can be set up to make it not "limited." I do not know why private school tuition is expensive, and I do not know why public school tuition is cheap. But I know that one is expensive and one is cheap. Since fully public schools are limited by funding, cooperation with private schools should be a last resort. Suppose a public primary school loses 100 yuan per year, while a private primary school must profit 20 yuan per year. Then the government can say to the private school, "Your 20 yuan profit will be paid by us, and you are not allowed to get it from the students." The private school, losing the income from students but gaining it from the government, should gladly comply, and the tuition fee can be reduced considerably. For the government, the cost of one school can help five schools, so why not do it? Otherwise, no matter how hard you try to encourage private schooling, if the private schools are not interested in education, the result will be either unreasonably high tuition fees, or students, even if they want to enroll, will be limited by the school gate opening wide with the words "Those who have ambition but no money, do not enter," and their aspirations will be completely dashed.

As for the money the government subsidizes private schools, there are many ways to generate revenue. For example, if dancing is not banned, a education tax of 10,000, 100,000, or even a million yuan could be added to each dance ticket, and the income would certainly be considerable. Using this to fund education would not be a problem, and if it had been thought of earlier, the tens of billions spent on repairing the doors, windows, and tables of the Social Affairs Bureau could have been transferred to education funding, and several more national primary schools could have been established. If dancing must be banned, then before the movie theaters close, a certain amount of education tax could be levied on each movie ticket, which would undoubtedly be a very large sum.

If the education authorities are truly dedicated to education, then this year they should focus on my method. The result will certainly be good, and I will not take credit for it.

### Happy Wanderings

— Chen Shenyan

### Chapter 10: Voluntary Sacrifice (65)

Qi Wan did not know what Yu Ru intended. Her starry eyes remained fixed on the old man's face. Yu Ru continued, "It's a pity you met too late. Zhu Zhai is already married. If I had known, I would have certainly..." Saying this, he shook his head repeatedly, expressing regret. Seeing the old man express himself in this way, Qi Wan was taken by surprise and stared blankly. Then, she heard Yu Ru say, "You are a good child. You are sensible and know etiquette. We old families should strive to maintain the old moral concepts. You must be able to help me. I have come to you today specifically to ask you for a favor. An old man in his sixties has come to your door to ask for a favor. You should be able to imagine how important this matter is to my entire family." Seeing Yu Ru speak so solemnly, Qi Wan knew that something might have changed. She raised her eyelids and glanced at Yu Ru, asking, "Sir, what is it? Please speak frankly. I am not a confused person. Everything should be done according to reason." Yu Ru nodded his head, saying, "I think you will understand me. Zhu Zhai is my only son. My old couple is over 130 years old combined, and we only have this one son. Since he got married, our only hope is that the young couple will get along and that we will have a little grandson. This kind of thinking is of course outdated in the modern trend, but I am from this kind of family, in this kind of environment, so this old concept cannot be eliminated. I have come here today to ask you a very presumptuous question: does Zhu Zhai come to see you every day? Do you two have an engagement? I hope you will tell me." As soon as Qi Wan heard this, she stood up and said, "Yes, we are engaged." Yu Ru said, "Have you considered this matter carefully? Do you know my family's situation?" Qi Wan said, "I know everything. I have already considered it. We are united in spirit. I think that in the future, if the environment is not good, I can eat roots and assist Zhu Zhai in overcoming difficulties. I will never have problems due to financial difficulties. Sir, you do not need to worry about this." Yu Ru shook his head slightly, saying, "You are mistaken. The difficulty I feel is not a matter of living expenses, but a matter of handling my family's affairs. For Zhu Zhai to marry you, he must divorce his wife. This cannot be approved by my family, especially Zhu Zhai's mother is strongly opposed. In the future, you will not have a title in my family. Although you love Zhu Zhai, you do not even fight for this little bit of status?"

### A Snippet from Churchill's Memoirs

— Lei Hong

Churchill is drafting his immortal memoirs. His report will surely include the following story:

During the Tehran Conference, he requested a private meeting with Stalin, with no one else present except for an interpreter. Their meeting lasted four and a half hours. During the meeting, in addition to telling him about the various matters to be discussed, Stalin also talked about the Soviet political organization, how every citizen could rise in the political or economic circles, and other idle chatter.

Then they talked about Soviet suspicion of Anglo-American policies. "Do you think we are going to attack your country?" Churchill asked him.

Stalin nodded.

Churchill asked again, "Why do you think so?"

"Because," Stalin said, "if I were you, I would do it!"

### The White House Switchboard Operator

— Mao Yi

Since the installation of the telephone in the White House in 1878, it had always been managed by men. It was not until the morning of March 7, 1933, that a woman named Hachmi Stein took over.

The name of this lady listed on the American government's payroll is: "Ms. Louis Lilian Hachmi Stein." However, the late President Roosevelt, his family living in the White House, his subordinates, and cabinet members all simply called her "Haki." Some called her that out of affection, but most did so for convenience.

In her youth, Haki never dreamed that one day she would be talking to presidents, emperors, nobles, and dignitaries from various countries. At first, she could not help but be cautious and somewhat fearful. However, after a few years, she became more natural. When Mrs. Roosevelt invited King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to a "hot dog" picnic at Hyde Park, Haki was also invited to accompany them. By then, she had been serving in the White House for six years, and everything had become familiar to her, so she was able to shake hands and say goodbye to the guests calmly and gracefully without excessive practice.

During Roosevelt's tenure, the White House switchboard operators memorized important phone numbers. When the New Deal was implemented, the phones were busiest. New agencies were constantly being established in large numbers. Haki's first task every night before going to bed was to recite and memorize the phone numbers of these new agencies. From then on, she built a small telephone reference library for herself. There were several books dedicated to recording private phone numbers.

When President Truman and his family moved into the White House, Haki and her subordinates began memorizing another large batch of new numbers, but these numbers were much fewer compared to before. Haki recorded every new number that Truman and his family dialed, and her subordinates did the same. Within a few days, they had memorized the most frequently dialed numbers.

Managing the telephone room for Truman was much simpler than during Roosevelt's tenure. When Roosevelt left Washington on tour, Haki was always one of his companions. Because Roosevelt relied heavily on the telephone, Haki was the best person to handle the switching. Every morning when Roosevelt woke up, the telephone would start ringing, and Haki would not be able to rest until he went to bed.

Roosevelt had a good habit of always informing the telephone room of his whereabouts, no matter where he was. His secretary would often notify Haki: "The President is at his desk working" or "He is in the swimming pool."

Truman was different. He did not have the habits of his predecessor. And the White House was not small, and there were not few telephones. Which extension was the most convenient for the President? Haki was smart. If she did not know where Truman was, she would first call the telephone in the hallway and ask the guard on duty to tell her the President's whereabouts.

Although Haki knew the philosophy of "smiling voices" for switchboard operators from her early telephone training, she did not apply it in the White House telephone room. "I don't want my girls to be as sweet as honey," she said. "I only want them to be happy to the extent that it does not hinder efficiency. If they use smiling voices in their own time, I will not interfere."

Every new White House switchboard operator learns how to address people by their rank or title. If the President's red light comes on, the switchboard operator immediately plugs in the plug and says, "Yes, Mr. President." To the other party, they say, "The President is calling," or simply, "The President of the United States."

For more than a decade, Haki has been operating the "National One Four One Four" telephone number. She is competent and happy in her work. And her greatest sorrow is the sudden death of Roosevelt, who never forgot to send her a gift on her birthday. This sorrow cannot be dispelled by time.

### The World's Largest Department Store

— Liang Zai

Macy's Department Store in New York is a grand 22-story building located between 7th Avenue, Broadway, 34th Street, and 35th Street, occupying an entire block. It is famous for its comprehensive collection of goods, from priceless jewelry and clothing to kitchen brooms costing a few cents.

Every morning, 11,000 employees waiting for Macy's to open their doors walk through the hundreds of glass doors and return to their positions. Then, this miniature "city" begins its activities. On average, 137,000 customers flock to Macy's every day, swarming like a tide among the huge pillars and counters. They appreciate various goods, fiddle with wool and silk with their fingers, and the crowds never seem to decrease until closing time. Macy's daily turnover averages $400,700, or about $126 million per year.

After Macy's iron doors are closed, another batch of workers uses trailers, vacuum cleaners, rags, and brooms to clean up dust and dirt. This cleaning team also numbers in the thousands.
