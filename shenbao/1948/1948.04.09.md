### Chairman Attends National Assembly This Morning to Report on Current Domestic and International Situation, Including Military, Political, and Economic Conditions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The National Assembly will hold its fourth plenary session on the 9th, morning and afternoon. Chairman Chiang is scheduled to attend the meeting at 10:00 AM to deliver a comprehensive policy report. He will address the current domestic and international situation, the military progress in suppressing the bandits and quelling the rebellion, as well as the general political and economic conditions. The session on the 9th will be chaired by Zuo Shunsheng and Gan Naiguang. The assembly will continue discussing the unfinished sections of the rules of procedure and the organizational regulations of the proposal review committee. Furthermore, the proposals submitted by various delegates to the Presidium are being expedited for compilation.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Chairman Chiang, concerned about the progress of the National Assembly, visited the venue at 4:10 PM on the 8th to observe the proceedings, taking a seat in the government officials' section. Around the break at 5:00 PM, the Chairman separately met with representatives from Shandong and Henan provinces, as well as Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly, among others, staying for approximately two hours before departing. When the Chairman arrived at the venue, the meeting had only been in session for fifteen minutes. Dai Mingsheng was delivering a speech, responding to the appeals of the signing delegates, followed by Jiang Bingxing's attempt to speak forcefully, which was loudly rebuked by Zhang Boling. All of these events were witnessed by the Chairman. At that time, the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely agitated. The Chairman stood up and watched intently for a long time. Subsequently, he engaged in conversation with Pan Gongzhan in the seating area and met with Henan delegates Zhang Fang, Yan Dai Chong, and Chen Panling. Zhang and others directly reported the severe situation in the Central Plains, requesting the dispatch of a large army to secure Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, recover Luoyang, stabilize western Henan, and expedite the issuance of guns and ammunition to the Henan Provincial Security Brigade. The Chairman responded that a large army was being dispatched to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, ensuring their security. The temporary abandonment of Luoyang was to concentrate forces and strike the main force of the bandits, with recovery expected soon. The bandits north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River will also be eliminated in a short period. The issuance of weapons to the security brigade will be expedited. During the break, the Chairman also met with Shandong delegate Guo Junqing and others in the Presidium's office. Guo requested relief for the critical situation in central Shandong, requesting the airlift of a large army to Weixian and Changle to relieve the siege of the two areas. The Chairman indicated that he was paying close attention to the war situation in central Shandong and that new plans for troop movements and deployment were being implemented.

### Draft Rules of Procedure Largely Amended and Passed, Adding Article "National Assembly May Discuss National Affairs"

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The third session of the National Assembly was held on the morning of the 8th. At 9:25 AM, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported that 2,551 delegates had registered, with 2,040 delegates present, meeting the legal quorum. The fourth group of the Presidium took turns chairing, and Chairman Wang Shijie announced the opening of the meeting. The session began with a moment of silence in memory of Wang Xifu, the delegate from Yongchang County, Gansu, who passed away on the 7th. The agenda then proceeded with the approval of the minutes of the previous session and the commencement of a clause-by-clause discussion of the draft rules of procedure for the assembly. The first, second, and third articles of the first chapter, "General Provisions," were passed without objection. However, the fourth article sparked debate due to Dong Xin's proposal to add a clause stating that "During the National Assembly sessions, the government's policy reports may be heard, national affairs may be discussed, and inquiries and suggestions may be made." Shi Songling urged the assembly to abide by the Constitution and to amend the powers granted to the assembly by the Constitution before proceeding, as there would otherwise be no legal basis, and rejection by the government would affect the assembly's prestige. Lin Zigui argued that Chairman Chiang had publicly stated that he would attend the assembly to explain the political situation, indicating that the government respected public opinion and supported Dong Xin's proposal. Shi Shangkuan suggested that Dong Xin's proposal did not need to be included in the rules but could be included in the agenda after a resolution by the assembly. He also proposed that the amendment to the fourth article proposed by Gu be voted on first. As a result, Zhao Yuanzhen's amendment, "The responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality of meetings extends to the staff of the Secretariat," was passed. The assembly continued to pass the sixth, seventh, and eighth articles of the second chapter, "Review of Delegate Qualifications," and the ninth and tenth articles of the third chapter. The eleventh article was passed with 1,170 votes in favor of Pan Gongzhan's amendment, which decided that each extension of the meeting time would be fifteen minutes, and if the quorum was still not met after two extensions, a discussion meeting would be held, with the session announced open when the quorum was met. The original drafts of the twelfth and thirteenth articles were passed. The fourteenth article was passed with 1,196 votes in favor of Liu Hua's amendment, which determined that the chairman must obtain the assembly's consent to extend the meeting time. After the sixteenth article was passed without objection, a heated debate arose again. Zhang Yuren proposed adding a "report" section to include government policy reports, representative opinions, inquiries, and suggestions. Dong Xin and others protested against the shelving of their proposal, and the crowd became agitated. Those who wanted to appeal to the assembly to respect the Constitution and offer opposing opinions were booed, and the entire venue was in chaos. After Chairman Wang strongly requested order and proceeded with the vote, the clause proposed by Dong Xin and others, which exceeded the powers granted to the National Assembly by the Constitution, was finally passed with 1,723 votes in favor (out of 2,041 people present) amidst thunderous applause, and was listed as the fifth article of the rules. After the break, the discussion of the seventeenth article of the fourth chapter continued. There were as many as fifteen amendments regarding the scope of the proposals, with most people advocating for expansion to include proposals related to national planning and people's livelihoods. Speakers rose one after another, and in the end, the proposal to delete the article was passed with 1,621 votes in favor, with over 96% of the 1,683 people present in agreement. Proposals were thus unrestricted in scope, and applause thundered again. As the eighteenth article was being discussed, it was already noon at 12:00 PM. The assembly opposed an extension, and adjournment was announced. The assembly only processed thirty-seven articles of the rules during the entire day of the 8th.

### Continued Meeting in the Afternoon, Clause-by-Clause Discussion of the Rules

The meeting continued at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, with 1,531 delegates in attendance. Chairman Zhang Boling announced the continuation of the previous agenda and the clause-by-clause discussion of the eighteenth article of the rules of procedure regarding the number of cosigners for proposals. With the agreement of the entire assembly, the number was amended from sixty in the original draft to twenty. The nineteenth article was passed without objection. As soon as the twentieth article was discussed, the issue of signing delegates was raised, causing controversy and gradually disrupting the order of the meeting. Zhang Boling exercised his authority as chairman and announced the cessation of speaking, reversing the agenda. At this time, Chairman Chiang had arrived at the meeting and was seated in the officials' section, quietly observing the proceedings of the meeting. Subsequently, the twentieth article was voted on, with 1,301 votes in favor (out of 1,596 delegates present) passing the amendment proposed by Chen Yingxing and others, deciding that the proposal review report should be sent to each delegate one day before the meeting to discuss it. The twenty-first article passed Luo Shize's amendment, which stipulated that the Secretariat should print and send the amendment to the review report on the constitutional amendment to each delegate six or three hours before the second reading. The twenty-second and twenty-third articles were passed as originally drafted. The twenty-fourth article of the fifth chapter (temporary motions) was passed as originally drafted. The twenty-fifth article passed Zhang Jinfu's amendment, reducing the number of cosigners required to propose a temporary motion from sixty to thirty. The twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh articles were passed as originally drafted. The twenty-eighth to thirty-second articles of the sixth chapter (discussion), five in total, were passed as originally drafted. The thirty-third article passed Liu Shougang's amendment with 928 votes in favor (out of 1,021 delegates present), stating that the chairman may also stop delegates who express opinions similar to those of previous speakers from speaking. The thirty-fourth article passed Chen Yingxing's amendment with 731 votes in favor (out of 1,026 delegates present), stating that for the chairman's decision on procedural matters, a declaration that it must be put to a vote to determine its validity or invalidity only requires the opposition of thirty people (the original draft was fifty people). The thirty-fifth article was maintained as originally drafted. The thirty-sixth article passed Chen Jilie's amendment with 944 votes in favor (out of 1,132 delegates present), stating that a motion to end the discussion only requires the consent of a majority (the original draft required two-thirds) to be established. The thirty-seventh article was passed without objection. Between this article and the thirty-eighth article, it was proposed to add an article stipulating that voting may be conducted when necessary, but Zhang Tieseng's amendment was rejected. By 6:00 PM, Chairman Zhang sought the opinion of the assembly on extending the meeting time. Several delegates pointed out that the number of delegates present was no longer sufficient to meet the quorum, so adjournment was announced. The assembly only processed thirty-seven articles of the rules during the entire day of the 8th.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 8th] US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, and David Bruce and a party of seven, flew into Guangzhou's Tianhe Airport at 2:35 PM on the 8th. T.V. Soong, Director of the Executive Headquarters, and other provincial and municipal leaders personally greeted them at the airport.

It is understood that the envoy's mission is not limited to inspecting the operations of the US Consulate and visiting Mr. Soong. According to sources, his visit to Guangzhou is to discuss with Mr. Soong the use of US aid materials for reconstruction in South China, expanding the supply of materials, and paving the way for US investment and development in South China.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 8th] After arriving here, Ambassador John Leighton Stuart told a United Press reporter that he is scheduled to fly to Hainan Island on the 12th, with Chairman Soong possibly accompanying him, returning to Guangzhou on the 13th and returning to Nanjing on the 14th. The Ambassador denied reports that the trip has any special mission.

### Issue of Signing Delegates' Attendance, Presidium Engages in Heated Discussion, Appoints Five to Negotiate with National Government for Reasonable Solution

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Regarding the issue of signing delegates attending the assembly, a motion from 1,332 delegates was raised at the third session on the 8th. The Presidium convened at 8:00 PM on the 8th and studied it in detail, adjourning only at 1:30 AM on the 9th. The Presidium meeting was presided over by He Yingqin, and Zuo Shunsheng, Yu Jiaju, Sun Yafu, and others attended. The motion was the subject of heated debate during the meeting. However, because the matter concerned the National Assembly Election and Recall Law and could not be resolved by the National Assembly Presidium, it was decided to submit it to the National Government, hoping for a legal and reasonable solution. Many members spoke during the discussion of the motion. Yu Bin, Gu Yuxiu, Gu Zhenggang, Pan Gongzhan, He Lu, Sun Yafu, and others all spoke. The Presidium expressed great concern for the fasting delegates and repeatedly studied the matter, deciding to appoint five people to negotiate with the National Government for a legal and reasonable solution. Yu Bin and others proposed two plans: (1) Over a hundred military representatives are all on the front lines suppressing bandits and cannot attend the assembly. Signing delegates may immediately attend to fill the vacancies. (2) The number of occupational representatives and women representatives is not stipulated in the Constitution but is determined by law. It is requested that the assembly resolve to ask the Legislative Yuan to amend the National Assembly Organization Law to increase the number of occupational and women representatives so that signing delegates can attend. Furthermore, the signing delegates and others gathered on the evening of the 8th to discuss the attendance issue, their emotions running high. They will express their views when the assembly discusses the issue. Furthermore, key members of the China Youth Party also discussed the issue of signing delegates on the evening of the 8th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The issue of signing delegates was raised at the third session of the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 8th, but it was not discussed because the agenda had not been completed.

### Vice-President Sun Discusses the International Situation, A Major War is Imminent, We Must Complete the Suppression of the Rebellion and Improve Military and Economic Affairs

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Vice-President Sun stated to our reporter at 6:00 PM on the 8th that constitutional governance and national construction require first suppressing the rebellion. The Communist rebellion has an international background, so suppressing the rebellion must be carried out with great determination and to the very end. If the Communists succeed in China, World War III will break out immediately. When the reporter asked if we could not solve the Communist problem and would delay it until it could be solved simultaneously with international problems, Sun said: Not so. He believed that the current international situation would not lead to a major war in the near future, while the Communist problem could be solved quickly and independently. Sun stated that to complete the suppression of the rebellion, efforts must be made to improve both military and economic affairs. For example, the organization of the Ministry of National Defense needs to be adjusted, but this issue is not simple. Regarding the economy, Sun believed that US aid of 338 million US dollars would allow China to receive nearly 30 million US dollars worth of materials per month, which could be sold to recover legal tender, reducing inflation and stabilizing prices.

When Sun discussed the election disputes, he stated: Based on the current situation, the procedures for preparing for the implementation of the Constitution stipulate that the first Legislative Yuan will convene on the seventh day after the National Assembly adjourns. Because the election disputes for the Legislative Yuan have not yet been resolved, it is feared that it will be difficult to realize as scheduled. Sun said: The signing delegates and nominated delegates' request to attend the assembly will inevitably cause a problem with the number of seats. Some people intend to include them in occupational groups, which does not seem appropriate, because the National Assembly delegates for occupational groups should be produced by occupational groups. Currently, only the National Assembly has the authority to decide on a solution. In the election of legislators, the problem is simpler than that of the National Assembly because there are no members of the party who signed the nominations. The same method as the National Assembly may be used for friendly parties. Sun argued on the basis of the election law: There is no difference between formal nominees and alternates, both are introductions. The result should be that those with more votes are elected. If we consider the facts to seek coordination, then we need to wait for the central government to decide.

### International Food Conference Report: China Urgently Needs to Import Rice

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] The International Emergency Food Committee reported to the International Food and Agriculture Organization Conference today that due to distribution difficulties and political turmoil, China is more dependent than before on importing rice.

Although production in inland China last year was almost normal, coastal areas still need a large amount of rice. The areas with the greatest need for food include Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, and part of Hebei, as well as the flooded areas downstream of the Liao River. China hopes to obtain most of the rice allocated in the 1947 recommendations from the United States and Southeast Asia this year, but 40,000 tons of rice are still awaiting shipment in Burma and Siam due to shipping difficulties.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, issued a statement on the 8th, in order to obey the party's resolution, stating that he would not run for president. The original text is as follows: "I am not self-effacing in my mediocrity. I occasionally listened to the advice of friends and came out to run for president. Later, I was surrounded by reporters and made fragmented remarks. Although it was said to be attracting a phoenix with a panpipe, those who know the situation have already smiled at me. Fortunately, after in-depth research and a solemn resolution by the party's plenary session, it unanimously requested that the President emerge and be elected as the first presidential candidate. Since public opinion has a consensus and opinions converge on one point, as a party member, I should immediately obey the party's resolution and no longer make any remarks about running for the presidency to confuse the public. I hereby declare."

[Another Dispatch] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, hosted a reception for National Assembly representatives from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 8th, with more than 390 people in attendance.

He also elaborated on his desire to participate in the election, believing that promoting the Constitution and realizing democratic politics are his inescapable responsibilities. Although his beard is white, his commitment to contributing to the country grows daily and he dares not slack off in the slightest.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] The Guangzhou Liaison Society and other eight revolutionary groups believe that the selection of the first president is of utmost importance and that Chairman Chiang is the only suitable candidate. However, regarding the vice-presidential election, the old revolutionary comrades all believe that Vice-President Sun is deeply aware of the true meaning of democracy and has been assisting the central government and presiding over the constitution-making process in recent years. To assist the President as the Vice-President after the implementation of the Constitution is the most appropriate choice. A campaign committee has been established and is sending telegrams to overseas locations and various regions to call for support.

### National Assembly Chronicle: The Mountain Rain is Coming, the Wind Fills the Tower

Our Newspaper Special Feature (April 8, Nanjing)

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] An unseasonal heatwave entered the capital, with the mercury rising to over 80 degrees. Outdoors, the sun was scorching, and indoors, it was stuffy and hot, like the eve of a storm.

Today's agenda was to discuss the rules of procedure for the assembly clause by clause. Wang Shijie and Zhang Boling shared the chairmanship of the assembly in the morning and afternoon. The rules of procedure were full of hidden reefs, and the first chapter, "General Provisions," was already hitting a reef. Some argued that the National Assembly should be able to hear government policy reports, review national affairs, and make inquiries and suggestions. Another representative, however, sent out a weaker voice in front of the loudspeaker: "This belongs to the representatives' authority. I very much agree, but I think the representatives should respect the Constitution. If this amendment is added, it will not comply with Article 27 of the Chiang Constitution." But the audience's response was a chorus of boos. Then, Lin Zigui, claiming to be speaking on behalf of several representatives, shouted: "Looking at the content presented by Chairman Chiang to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang yesterday, our request for the government to make policy reports and review the current situation has already been approved by Chairman Chiang; we ask the chairman (referring to the chairman of the assembly) to pay attention to the situation." This signal was ultimately diverted by the chairman's diplomatic methods, and he calmly shifted the goal, saying that it would be discussed when discussing Article 17. But this only sought a moment of silence. After a series of unanimous passages from Article 6 to Article 16, the discussion of Article 17 had already arrived. This loud call explained that they were fighting for "rights," that is, expanding powers that affected the Constitution itself. Although most people were wondering if revising would shake the Constitution, this call aroused enthusiasm. So, whoever stood up and said to respect the Constitution was out of touch, whoever was the enemy of this impulsive mood. Some uttered shadowy sentences that violated the Constitution.

The meeting was not announced until five minutes before 4:00 PM. Only ten minutes passed, and the storm came. Representative Wang Yunming jumped onto the speaker's platform and, in an extremely calm attitude, loud voice, and melodious tone, called on the 1,332 representatives who cosigned the motion to appeal for the fasting signing delegates. He said: "This will be more important than anything else, I ask everyone to pay attention. The fasting delegates have already written their death notes. If they really die from fasting, it will not only be a shame for the assembly but also a stain on constitutional governance. People are not made of wood or stone, who can be indifferent? Please ask the chairman to accept the motion for the signing delegates to attend the assembly and submit it to the assembly for discussion." This motion won applause. At this time, Chairman Chiang walked out of the door on the left side of the podium, wearing casual clothes, and gently walked to the officials' platform. The audience below, upstairs, and downstairs was noisy and chaotic. At this moment, Jiang Bingxing, a representative of the China Youth Party, because he wanted to express his opinion on Wang Yunming's words, ran towards the speaker's platform. The chairman said that he was stopping the speech now, but it had no effect. Yu Jiaju also shouted from the loudspeaker behind: "We are here to govern constitutionally, not to destroy the constitution, and we cannot submit it for discussion. The chairman should be responsible for it." Jiang Bingxing insisted on speaking. Chairman Zhang Boling sternly said: "I won't let you speak"! The old man roared, but it was useless. In the cries from upstairs that "People are going to starve to death" mixed with applause, applause, and jeers, Chen Qitian persuaded Jiang Bingxing to leave, saying it was a relief, and the storm slowly subsided. Chairman Chiang, sitting on the officials' platform, stood up at the most chaotic moment but sat down after only two minutes. Some said that it was because he stood up that those who instigated the storm knew that the wind was calming down.

Chairman Zhang Boling and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou continued the meeting procedure and discussed the remaining chapters and rules in order. Today's storm is over.

That evening, the bandit army launched another full-scale attack on our strongholds in the north of the city and the power plant, with particularly fierce fighting for the strongholds in the north of the city. The bandits launched thirteen assaults, but by dawn on the 8th, all the attacking bandits had been repelled by the National Army.

### US State Department Formulates New Policy Toward Japan Based on Reports from Various Parties; Denies the Existence of a Far East Marshall Plan

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] British Labour MP Mr. Batten recently summarized the views of British industry regarding Japan, stating: "To enable Japan to survive while ensuring that it does not become a threat to the international community is the test of our political work in the peace conference. Japan must not be allowed to engage in industrial competition at will again. The way to achieve this is to implement a plan for the utilization of Japanese industry, which must be rationally completed in accordance with the needs and resources of other countries. Currently, British industry feels envious of the recovery of Japanese industry under MacArthur's protection."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida, in an effort to seek cooperation between the people and the government, will stipulate that the first Wednesday of each month will be used for a broadcast address, in order to communicate the government's intentions to the people and to solicit feedback and support.

### Our Policy Toward Japan Remains Unchanged; Foreign Minister Wang Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters; Believe We Are Closely Watching the Development of US Policy Toward Japan

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 8th] The Associated Press sent a written inquiry to Foreign Minister Wang Shijie on the 8th regarding China's attitude towards the development of new US policies towards Japan. Wang replied, "China's policy remains consistent, and our government's position is no different from what was announced on February 13th." Wang stated on February 13th that if there are guarantees to prevent Japan from rebuilding its military strength, China is willing to support all reconstruction policies for enemy countries. Authoritative sources say that although China will not change its policy towards Japanese reconstruction due to recent developments, it is paying close attention to these developments. China has long anticipated that US policy towards Japan would change, so it does not feel surprised or embarrassed by the Strack report and the Clapp Mission. Reliable sources say that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs feels that the US and China are in complete agreement on preventing the resurgence of Japanese militarism. Although the Chinese government does not believe that the US would do so, some quarters have criticized the US for its "naivete."

### Argentina and Guatemala Advocate "The Americas for the Americans"; Propose Eliminating Colonies at the Pan-American Conference

[Associated Press, Bogotá, Colombia, 7th] Argentina and Guatemala on the 7th requested the Pan-American Conference to invoke the principle of "The Americas for the Americans" to eliminate foreign colonies in the Western Hemisphere. Argentine representative Colomina adopted this stance to defend Argentina's claim to the British-held Falkland Islands and the expansion of South Antarctic territories to the Antarctic. Guatemala suggested eliminating European colonies in the Americas, namely British Honduras, British, French and Dutch Guiana, and the West Indies. Colomina expressed his approval and proposed amending it to include the Falkland Islands and the South Antarctic region. It is expected that Guatemala will propose the establishment of a permanent committee representing the Pan-American Union to directly consult with European countries on the peaceful resolution of colonial issues. Chilean representative Enríquez also supported Argentina's proposal. Chile has also made claims to South Antarctic territories, which conflict with Argentina. The two countries are now trying to resolve the dispute. At the same time, the US delegation suggested that legal disputes between American countries should be resolved by the International Court of Justice.

### British-Soviet Plane Collision; Soviet Commander Sternly Reprimands the British Side

Refuses Investigation by the Four-Power Committee

[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] British Commander-in-Chief Robertson returned to Berlin today from Düsseldorf by special plane. The British side's reply to the Soviet side regarding the Berlin plane collision is being drafted by the British Headquarters. Robertson had two telephone conversations with London last night regarding this matter. Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky's letter to Robertson on the 6th of this month was released today. The letter rejected the British request for the Four-Power Committee to investigate the collision, insisting that the investigation be carried out by the British and Soviet sides only. It also stated that Robertson's letter to him, especially the British newspapers' reports on the plane collision, all accused the Soviet plane of deliberately causing the incident, which was malicious slander and intentional provocation.

### Rumors That Molotov May Be Dismissed Soon

[Associated Press, London, 8th] The "New Statesman" weekly newspaper published today that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov may be dismissed soon. Molotov was criticized at the Soviet Politburo meeting in February this year, but was later trusted.

### Division of Germany Has Become a Foregone Conclusion; Date of Allied Control Council Meeting Still Undetermined; If the Soviet Union Refuses to Cooperate, the Three Powers Will Take Independent Action

[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] A British official spokesperson stated that none of the four powers has taken action to convene a meeting of the Allied Control Council. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held on April 10th. In addition, French Foreign Ministry Political Director Merville suddenly arrived in Berlin today, leading people to believe that there has been progress in the talks on the merger of the French zone with the British and American zones. Although Merville said that this trip was purely for social purposes, this statement is not widely believed.

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] The French government solemnly stated that it will continue to do its best to keep the door open for negotiations regarding the German issue "until the very last moment." People in Paris believe that Robertson's intention is to inform the Soviet Union that the Western powers are already engaged in the final preparations for establishing a West German government.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Political figures here believe that the remarks made by Robertson, the British military governor in Germany, in Düsseldorf on the 7th, indicate that the division of Germany has become an undeniable fact. The Western occupying powers are now only waiting for the separation between East and West Germany to become absolute. Robertson's remarks are the first time that a senior British official in Germany has declared to the world that Britain and the US have recognized the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the Allied Control Council on March 20th as a warning that East and West Germany are about to part ways. London observers believe that the two most important points in Robertson's entire speech are the insistence that currency reform is the current urgent task of the British-American merged zone authorities, and his emphasis that the Frankfurt Economic Council can be quickly transformed into a political government organization when necessary. The deadline for a four-power agreement on all-German currency reform is next Sunday, that is, the day after Clay convenes a meeting of the Allied Control Council on April 11th. If the Soviet Union still refuses to attend the meeting, the Western countries will regard the deadline as having passed, and cooperation is impossible, and the Western countries will have the freedom to carry out their plans on their own. What remains to be decided is whether General Clay, who is the chairman of the Allied Control Council this month, will decide to convene a meeting of the Allied Control Council on April 10th, or postpone it to give the Soviet Union a longer opportunity to consider.

### Drafting of Sixteen-Nation Multilateral Agreement Nearing Completion; General Assembly on April 16th If Assembled

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin has agreed to convene a meeting of foreign ministers from sixteen European countries in Paris on April 16th. If this date is accepted by the foreign ministers of all countries, representatives of the foreign ministers will meet in Paris two days earlier to adopt the report of the working committee and then submit it to the foreign ministers' meeting for signature. The report will include an introduction outlining the general objectives of the permanent organization of the sixteen countries, and stipulating the organizational law of the permanent organization. The organization has two goals: (1) to cooperate with the US's European Recovery Program executor in the implementation of the program; (2) to promote coordination among the sixteen countries in finance, production, and trade.

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] Reliable sources say that the draft multilateral agreement to be signed at the next general assembly of the sixteen-nation Marshall Plan is almost complete.

### Prospects for Italian General Election; Communist Position Declining

[Associated Press, Rome, 7th] Regarding the general election to be held in Italy on the 18th of this month, it is now clear that it will be a great victory. This statement is not intended to predict the election results, but only to report that the Communist Party's current hopes of victory seem very different from what they were a month ago. However, unexpected events can still occur, especially unexpected actions on the part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has so far remained almost entirely aloof from the election campaign.

### Dulles Suggests Organizing an International Anti-Communist Intelligence Agency; US State Department Conducting Thorough Research

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] Republican foreign policy expert Dulles has suggested to Secretary of State Marshall that an international anti-communist intelligence agency be organized to protect the free institutions of the Western world. Dulles believes that without the organization of an international counter-espionage and intelligence agency, Western countries will have no way to gain an advantage in the Cold War. Dulles's suggestion is currently being thoroughly researched by the State Department.

### US Suffers First Setback at the International Conference on Freedom of the Press; General Assembly Passes Two Proposals Despite US Opposition

[Reuters, Geneva, 7th] The US suffered two setbacks today at the International Conference on Freedom of the Press. One was the passage of a resolution by the General Assembly encouraging the establishment of government-supported news agencies in countries without established news agencies, regardless of whether these countries discriminate against foreign news agencies. The other was the passage by a majority vote in the General Assembly's main committee of a resolution on the elimination of bias. The division of the Western countries' line at the meeting has been the first time since the meeting opened.

The US intended to have the General Assembly pass a resolution condemning irresponsible journalism, but at the same time, it could not adopt any opinions put forward by the Soviet Union to avoid giving the Soviet Union an excuse for propaganda. The US has now discovered that the drafting committee is in danger of adopting some Soviet opinions and forming a compromise proposal. The main reason for the US's failure is that Australia's proposal of a lengthy amendment has changed the wording of the US resolution, making many representatives believe that the amendment cannot be merged with the US resolution unless the drafting committee forms a compromise proposal. Australia, France, and several countries on the European continent have formed a united line on this, advocating the adoption of stronger wording than the US resolution. Regarding the resolution on news agencies, it states, "In countries where national news agencies are not yet developed, their governments may support news agencies until these news agencies are fully developed, and foreign news agencies shall not unfairly or abnormally impede the development of other countries' news agencies." US representative Brown, with the support of the Soviet Union, Mexico, the Philippines, and Uruguay, opposed the resolution, believing that the resolution encouraged the establishment of news monopolies. The Yugoslav representative then attacked the US's Associated Press and United Press, pointing out that they are monopolistic businesses controlled by a few people, such as the United States being controlled by a few people such as McCormick and Hearst. In the end, the resolution opposed by the US was passed by a vote of sixteen to five.

[US Information Service, Geneva, 7th] The General Committee of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press voted to accelerate the work of the meeting in order to adjourn on April 20th, and to hold plenary meetings for the last four days of the session.

### Hoffman's New Position Approved by Senate

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The Senate has verbally approved the appointment of Hoffman as the executor of the European Recovery Program, also in charge of economic aid to China. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg told senators today that the Foreign Relations Committee had spoken with Hoffman for an hour and a half, reviewing "every stage of the foreign aid bill, and the Foreign Relations Committee is completely satisfied. Hoffman has a basic understanding of the relevant issues." Hoffman said after the Senate approved his new position that he believes that it will take a considerable amount of time to organize the management of the aid to Europe program in Washington. He hopes that the organization of the foreign part will be undertaken by an ambassador-at-large. The selection of his assistants has not yet been determined, and he hopes that one or two of his old partners from the Studebaker Corporation can join.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] The Senate today passed the appointment of Hoffman as the executor of the economic aid to Europe and China plan. It is believed that President Truman will soon nominate a deputy executor and an ambassador-at-large to supervise and coordinate the recovery plan in Europe.

### Communist Demonstration in Trieste

[Associated Press, Trieste, 8th] The Communist Party today launched the largest demonstration here in recent months to bury union members who died last week. The parade lasted an hour and a half, with about 10,000 participants.

### The Five Permanent Members of the Security Council Consider the Issue of New Members Joining

### Stassen's Momentum Impressive in Wisconsin Primary

Already Defeated MacArthur and Dewey

[Associated Press, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 7th] Former Minnesota Governor Stassen defeated General MacArthur and New York Governor Dewey by an overwhelming margin in the significant Wisconsin Republican presidential primary. His hopes of becoming a presidential candidate have suddenly gained momentum. Reports from 3,138 polling districts in Wisconsin have only 102 districts unfinished, so the belonging of the 27 delegates to the Republican National Convention seems to be a foregone conclusion. Stassen won 19 delegates, and MacArthur won 8. Dewey has only a slight hope of winning one delegate seat. In the 5th Congressional District, the situation is still unclear, and Dewey's delegate is only 112 votes fewer than Stassen's delegate. The candidate with the most votes for Stassen's statewide delegates was Kohler, with 228,217 votes. The candidate with the most votes for MacArthur's delegates was former Governor La Follette, with 207,237 votes.

### General Chennault on American Policy Toward China

Copyright by Scripps Howard Newspaper Alliance. Translated by our Editorial Department. (13) The Mixed Blessings of the Salween River Campaign

The American supply plan for China's Salween River campaign was a pathetic failure. This campaign was initiated under the pressure of General Stilwell in 1944.

The record of this campaign seems to confirm that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was reluctant to participate in this addition to the Burma campaign, and rightly so, as the British had already cancelled their commitment to an amphibious landing in lower Burma. In the winter of 1942-3, Stilwell estimated that the Salween expeditionary force could fight if it received 2,000 tons of airlifted goods per month, but several months later, at a strategic conference in Washington, he estimated that the Salween troops needed 10,000 tons of stockpiled goods. In the end, even this number proved to be very conservative.

Although the American Y Force, responsible for training and equipping the expeditionary force, had been in existence for over a year before the Chinese army forcibly crossed the Salween River in May 1944, the organization failed to complete an effective supply plan. About two weeks before the expeditionary force actually began fighting, the overland supply plan along the Salween River was abandoned and replaced by an aerial resupply plan. As a result, the work of flying over the Hump was further dispersed, and China's monthly cargo from the Hump decreased by more than 1,000 tons.

The failure of the Salween River supply plan came to my attention in March 1944, when a representative of General Dorn, commander of the Y Force, consulted with me, asking if it was advisable to transport supplies from the Hump area by air to the vicinity of the Salween River front.

He explained that the supplies were stockpiled in Yunnan Yi, but the Y Force lacked road transport to move the supplies westward. He also said that the Y Force's plan required about 7,000 head of livestock to transport supplies from near the unloading point to the battle zone, but they obtained less than 3,000 head of livestock.

In addition to the actual lack of trucks, the supply problem was further complicated by the lack of proper refueling facilities for the few trucks available. Therefore, every month, 500 to 1,000 tons of alcohol had to be airlifted from Kunming to Yunnan Yi. This alcohol, made in China, was used to replace better fuel.

It is worth pointing out that the sudden westward movement of fuel from the Kunming area virtually brought the already insufficient truck operations to the air force bases in southeastern China to a complete standstill.

Despite repeated protests, the Y Force's priority for truck fuel continued to reduce supply operations to the east, forcing a major reduction in air operations before the Japanese offensive and forcing the Fourteenth Air Force to retreat to rear bases when the Battle of Hengyang reached its climax.

Because the number of transport livestock could not meet the needs, the Chinese troops in the mountains and on the other side of the Salween River had to rely on aerial drops to obtain food, guns, and ammunition. In my opinion, this situation was clearly caused by a misconception on the part of the ground commanders, who believed that the Chinese were "hoarding" trucks and livestock. Dorn consistently believed that the Chinese were deliberately holding on to these tools. He even accused the Chinese of hiding trucks for post-war use, although it is difficult to imagine that trucks could be left unused throughout the war and still be useful afterwards.

Moreover, careful investigation did not reveal any hidden trucks, and there was no way to refute the Yunnan provincial authorities' claim that providing even half of the 70,000 head of livestock needed would be enough to render the entire province uncultivable and lead to famine. During the war, the stories of hoarding were told to such an extreme extent by those who criticized China that they became ridiculous. When southeastern China was lost in 1944 due to American insistence on concentrating efforts in Burma, the Guilin Garrison Command was accused of hoarding simply because it had 2,000 rounds of light artillery shells.

In fact, the most severe criticism we can level against the Guilin Garrison Command is that this "hoarding" was far too little when Guilin was attacked by the Japanese.

### Sharp Increase in Prices of Water, Electricity, Telephone, and Gas This Month. Telephone Price Reaches 98%. Councilors to Meet to Stabilize Prices. Request Central Government to Adopt Suggestions. Advance Foreign Exchange Settlement for Public Utility Equipment, or Subsidies May Be Provided in Three Months.

[Our Newspaper] The prices of four public utilities in the city, including water, electricity, telephone, and gas, have been internally determined to be adjusted from today. The new prices for April have been reviewed and decided by the Public Utilities Bureau last night, and will be re-reviewed by representatives of the City Council this morning before being sent directly to Mayor Wu for approval. In case the procedures are not completed in time, the implementation may be delayed until tomorrow. Among the public utilities, the telephone price has increased the most, reaching 98%, while water, electricity, and gas have increased by an average of about 60%.

It is reported that the new prices of public utilities were originally scheduled to be implemented from tomorrow (the 10th), but at a discussion meeting held by the Public Utilities Bureau the day before yesterday, the persons in charge of various companies repeatedly stated that they could not bear the burden and requested that the implementation be advanced by one day to today. The new prices were specially submitted to the mayor for review overnight yesterday. Detailed prices may be announced today. It is reported that the water, electricity, and gas companies have requested an increase of nearly 100%, while the telephone company has requested an increase of 144% due to the extremely high increase in the metal index in March. This was reduced only after repeated efforts by the representatives of the City Council.

[Our Newspaper] The Public Utilities Committee of the City Council held its 24th meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the high prices of public utilities. After a temporary motion: (1) Shao Yongsheng proposed: Request Chairman Pan to immediately request the Central Government to adopt the Council's recommendations regarding the impact of foreign exchange and coal price increases on public utility prices, which have risen sharply this month, for advance foreign exchange settlement for three months for the equipment and fuel needed for public utilities, or direct subsidies from the Central Government, and also freeze the price of coal used for public utilities, so that prices can be stabilized. Resolution: Approved as proposed. (2) Jiang Hao proposed: The telephone calculation formula has some improprieties. It is proposed to ask the Public Utilities Investigation Committee to study and revise it. Resolution: Approved as proposed.

In addition, at the Public Utilities Committee meeting, regarding (A) "The Municipal Government's letter on the principles for handling the contract with the French Tram and Electric Light Company for operating water, electricity, and transportation businesses, please review," it was resolved to agree in principle and reply for reference. The principles set by the Municipal Government are excerpted as follows:

In the future, when the Shanghai United Power Company is established, it may join as a participating company. (2) Regarding the transportation business, in order to facilitate the implementation of the urban transportation plan, the company should relinquish its exclusive franchise, but the current operating routes may be allowed to maintain the status quo, and further plans will be made after the entire plan is implemented. In the future, when the urban transportation company is established, the company may participate with priority or unify in other ways. (3) Regarding the water supply business, it is permitted to continue operating. In the future, if there is a unified Shanghai water supply business being planned, the company may participate in the organization. (4) Regarding the above three principles, the Municipal Government should establish a memorandum of understanding with the company to exchange documents in order to maintain credibility.

(B) "According to the Shanghai Ferry Industry Vocational Association's request to forward a letter to the Public Utilities Bureau to maintain the existing business of Dongjiadu, please review," it was resolved to ask the Public Utilities Bureau to handle it at its discretion.

### Preparing to Ration Coal Briquettes Based on Population, First Investigate Production Capacity

[Our Newspaper] The authorities are considering rationing coal briquettes based on population. The People's Food Allocation Committee convened a meeting with mechanical coal briquette merchants on the 7th to discuss this matter. Because it is necessary to first investigate the production capacity of each factory, the distribution situation of retailers, and the composition of coal briquettes, it was decided that the association will compile a list and report it in the coming days, and then make concrete preparations. The original plan was to calculate the rationing quantity based on households, but now, considering that some households have dozens of people while others have only one person, it will be changed to a daily unit. For April, only industrial workers will be rationed coal. Applications from various factories were closed on April 5th, totaling more than 2,000 units. After approval, they can be distributed in the latter half of this month.

### Rice Rationing for Four Months Fully Secured; Surplus Grain to Be Sold in the Market Separately

[Our Reporter] Ren Xianqun, Director of the Food Distribution Committee, told reporters yesterday: (1) The rice quantity for rationing in this city for March, April, May, and June of this year, calculated generously at 500,000 shi per month, totaling 2 million shi, has been fully secured. In addition, 90,000 shi were transferred to the Nanjing Municipal Government. Due to weather conditions, the remaining surplus rice will be supplied to the market to prevent spoilage. When this stored rice was supplied to the North City Market yesterday, no one purchased it, while the South City Market sold over 300 shi. (2) Rationing must not be stopped during the lean months of July, August, and September. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, after traveling to Nanjing last week to make contact, has secured a solution for the rice source. After the passage of the US Aid to China Act, a large amount of American rice will continue to be shipped to China, and part of it will be used to continue rationing in Shanghai. (3) To avoid the reverse flow of rice from this city to the producing areas, he and Director Wu drafted a plan to purchase rice arriving at the port and submitted it to Mayor Wu for approval. The primary premise of this purchase plan is to avoid stimulating grain prices. It is currently being reviewed by Mayor Wu and has not yet been decided. If implemented perfectly, it can make the city's grain reserves exceed those before the war, providing a good indirect way to stabilize grain prices.

### Fishing Industry Strike Stalled: Sailors Strike on the Fourth Day; Fresh Fish Prices Rise by 30%

The strike by sailors in the private fishing vessel industry is at a standstill. Yesterday was the fourth day of the strike, and fresh fish prices have already risen by about 30%. Although the Garrison Headquarters and the Seamen's Union continued mediation, the issue remained unresolved by evening. More than 20 fishing vessels and over 300 sailors are on strike. It remains questionable whether fishing vessels returning from fishing will also be drawn into the vortex. People in the fishing industry are anxious about this unfortunate incident, and they unanimously accuse the Fishing Management Office's dumping and preferential treatment as the main causes of the strike.

### Director of the Fishing Management Office Discusses Treatment Issues

[Our Reporter] Zhao Junmai, Director of the Fishing Management Office of the Post-War Relief Committee, told reporters yesterday that the office is reducing staff every month to tighten expenses, having already cut over 400 employees in recent months. Another 40 or so employees will be laid off this month. As for the rumors that the Fishing Management Office's sailors receive particularly good treatment, Director Zhao said that the captains with the highest fishing capacity do have substantial income, which is true, but only during the fishing season (about two months).

Supplies Only for Fishing Vessels; No Salaries

It is understood that the treatment system for sailors at the Fishing Management Office has long been improved since Zhao took office, meaning that they do not receive any salaries or bonuses, only supplies for fishing vessels. All tools such as fishing nets and fuel for fishing vessels must be provided by the captain, and any damage to the machinery on board must also be compensated. For example, each fishing vessel spends about 400 million yuan on each fishing trip (about two or three weeks each time). If they only catch 30,000 catties of fish, the captain will lose money. Because the Fishing Management Office takes 40% to 60% of the proceeds from the sale of fish by the vessel, depending on the performance. If a vessel earns 1.4 billion yuan from the sale of fish after each trip, deducting the 400 million yuan in expenses, the Fishing Management Office gets 600 million yuan, and the captain is left with only 400 million yuan. This 400 million yuan must be divided among the ten or so crew members, because the crew members also do not receive salaries. Currently, the best performers can catch over 100,000 catties of fish each time, but there are two months each year when no fish can be caught, at which time the fishermen get nothing. Zhao continued that this system encourages sailors to work hard and also makes them cherish public vessels.

Fresh Fish Made into Dried Fish; Daily Production of 10,000 Catties

In addition, the office's work of using fresh fish to make salted dried fish began two weeks ago, with a daily production of 10,000 catties. It is currently being packaged and crated, and will be transported to the interior for supply in the future. The fresh fish is purchased from Chinese sailors at 15,000 yuan per catty. This work is still in its initial stages, and the office will gradually expand its equipment and make canned fish itself in the future.

### Killing Without Blinking an Eye, What Talk of Friendship? Countless Atrocities Committed in Chongming; Two War Criminals Executed Simultaneously; Nakano and Oba Requested to Write Letters and Smoke Before Execution

[Our Reporter] Nakano Hisao, the former head of the Special High Division of the Chongming Gendarmerie, who once escaped from prison, was sentenced to death by the military court and approved by the Chairman. He was executed by firing squad at Tilanqiao Prison yesterday at noon together with Oba Hayato, the captain of the Chongming Gendarmerie, who was also sentenced to death. During their tenure in the Chongming Gendarmerie, Oba Hayato and Nakano Hisao specialized in capturing and killing our guerrillas. Their method of killing was to tie a huge stone to the person and throw them into the sea, and countless people were victimized. After the victory, the two criminals were reported by the family members of the victims, Huang Zifang, etc., and interrogated by the military court. In November of last year, the military judge of the court was sent to Chongming for an on-site investigation. At that time, the family members of the victims complained so much that the road was blocked. The military judge also found many corpses buried on the seashore. Based on confirmed evidence, Oba Hayato was sentenced to death. Nakano Hisao, knowing that he could not escape the law, escaped from prison before the military court's scheduled verdict. Later, he disguised himself and pushed a tricycle at the Zhabu Road bridgehead. He was finally arrested by the authorities and sentenced to death.

Wang Jiamai, the chief prosecutor of the military court, Wang Renming, the interpreter, Wang Chengshenghua, the clerk, and a platoon of armed military police went to Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison at 11:00 AM to bring up Oba and Nakano. After asking their names, ages, and places of origin, Chief Prosecutor Wang stood up and read the approved judgment issued by the Ministry of National Defense and asked if they had anything to say. Nakano was unrepentant until his death, still claiming to be innocent, and falsely claiming, "I hope to promote Sino-Japanese friendship with my sacrifice." Oba said, "I also hope for Sino-Japanese friendship and hope that the court will go to Chongming again to investigate the truth." The prosecutor immediately rebuked, "The evidence in this case is very conclusive and there is no need for further investigation. This death sentence is to punish you for your past crimes of killing, arson, and disregard for humanity in China. As for whether Sino-Japanese friendship will exist, it is a matter of future diplomatic relations and does not need to be discussed by you." The two criminals then requested to write a will and smoke cigarettes. The prosecutor granted their request and gave each of them two cigarettes. The two criminals then wrote several wills at their desks. After writing, they were tied to the execution ground and executed by military police. Oba Hayato was shot once, and Nakano Hisao was shot twice, and they died on the spot. After the corpses were verified to be correct, they were covered with white cloth and taken away by the Japanese Liaison Group for burial.

### Rice Prices Reach New High; People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Says Stimulated by Transportation Costs and Foreign Exchange

Yesterday, the rice market hit a new high price since spring. Special white japonica rice once broke out of the four million mark, shouting a price of 4.03 million yuan. Later, as a large amount of goods arrived in the market, customers took advantage of the high price to sell slightly, and the price fell slightly, closing near the border, at 4 million yuan, and then rising by 100,000 yuan. Transactions outside the market after closing still hovered around the 4.1-4.2 million mark. In addition, superior thin rice was priced at 4 million yuan, and early rice opened at 3.9 million yuan, both up 100,000 yuan. Yangxian rice prices were slightly flat, at 3.8 million yuan. Baiyuan rice was 3.9 million yuan, and brown japonica rice was 3.4 million yuan. The South City Market also had a strong appetite from all sides, and prices soared by 150,000 yuan at the opening. The Shen City market, due to rice distribution by the Market Management Committee, once retreated by 50,000 yuan, but then rose again, leveling with the opening price. White japonica rice and thin rice were each priced at 3.9 million yuan. To meet market needs, the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee began selling rice at the market price in both the North and South markets yesterday, but because the North City market's actual sales were sluggish, no sales were made, and only 382.5 shi were sold in the South City market.

In response to the sharp rise in rice prices in recent days, the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee issued the following statement yesterday: To replenish the city's food reserves and restore the average pre-war food stock of 500,000 to 1 million bags, to stabilize grain prices in the long term, the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau formulated a method to purchase the remaining rice after the market closes. As soon as the municipal government approves it, representatives from relevant agencies will be convened for consultation, still aiming not to stimulate grain prices. This will enable rice merchants to purchase more from the production area after selling. The committee also analyzed the reasons for the recent rise in rice prices, stating that the 15% increase in rice prices in the past three days was due to the stimulation of high transportation costs and rising foreign exchange rates.

### Strive to Purchase Raw Cotton as Much as Possible; Supply Should Pose No Problem

[Report from this newspaper] According to news from the Yarn Control Committee: (1) Regarding the Shandong Provincial Government and garrison's request for requisitioning and borrowing cotton stored in Jinan purchased by the Textile Construction Company on their behalf, the committee had submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to forward it to the Executive Yuan for an order to prohibit it. It has recently been heard that the Shandong Provincial Government has complied with the Executive Yuan's telegram order, approving the release of the previously borrowed 3,000 bales of cotton stored by the Textile Construction Company. The committee informed the Textile Construction Company yesterday.

(2) From this month to the end of the year, the estimated national demand for raw cotton is 6 million dan (a unit of weight). The committee claims that the supply should pose no problem, as the current cotton stock of various factories, the Indian cotton exchanged by the Foreign Trade Committee, and the raw cotton arriving in port with self-provided foreign exchange amount to 3.2 million zu (another unit of weight). At the same time, the committee has received 400,000 dan in various regions, and another 600,000 zu can be collected, totaling 1 million dan. In addition, there are 100,000 bales of American loan cotton, equivalent to 1.8 million zu, totaling 6 million dan.

(3) The committee has 40,000 dan of stored cotton in Xi'an, and can still purchase 200,000 dan. It has now decided to sign an agreement with China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Transportation Company to have CNAC transport the cotton directly to Shanghai by air, with an initial batch of 200 tons. The Central Transportation Company will transport an initial batch of 1,000 tons from Xi'an to Baoji by train, and then by truck via Chongqing to Shanghai. The above 1,200 tons of raw cotton can be transported within two months. If it proceeds smoothly, it will continue to be handled.

### Javanese Chinese First Battle, Victory, 3-1 Breakthrough Against the Railway Team

The first match of the Javanese-Chinese football team in Shanghai was against the Railway team yesterday. It was held at the Yiyuan Stadium, and more than 5,000 people watched.

The game kicked off at 4:15. The Javanese-Chinese team played against the wind. Chen Hongyun shot from midfield, and the ball hit the crossbar. The Railway team counterattacked, with a fierce momentum, but unfortunately, it was just a little off. At 12 minutes, Chen Hongyun powerfully shot from 20 yards away, and the ball flew like an arrow. Liao Xiong failed to catch it, and the goal was breached. The Javanese Chinese team scored first. The Railway team was unwilling to fall behind. Just three minutes later, Zhang Jie drove straight in, and the Javanese-Chinese defense failed to catch up, and scored a goal to tie the score 1-1. The first half ended without a winner.

Changing sides, the formation remained unchanged. The Javanese Chinese team became more courageous. At 32 minutes, Chen Hongyun was blessed by fortune, overtaking the Railway team's defense and scoring directly, making it 2-1. One minute later, Chen Hongyun continued his efforts and broke through the net again, and Java surprisingly took a 3-1 lead. The Railway team lost two goals in a row, and their morale was disrupted. The Javanese Chinese team had the upper hand all the way and controlled the whole game. The visiting team finally won their first match 3-1.

### Beijing Newspapers Protest Interview Methods for National Games

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Beijing newspapers recently filed a written protest to the Ministry of Education and the National Games Organizing Committee regarding the issues of interviewing news and taking photos at the National Games. The standard set by the National Games Publicity and Consultation Committee for issuing entrance permits to news reporters allows each newspaper in Shanghai to have ten people, but only one person for each newspaper in other cities.

### The World Games Football Selection is Extremely Unfair: The Qingbai Association Expresses its Opinion on Wu Qixiang's Failure to be Selected

According to Wang Xinheng, vice chairman of the Qingbai Sports Association: "The football team for our country's participation in the World Games has been formed, and only four people from Shanghai have been selected, which is extremely unfair. It is even more regrettable that Wu Qixiang was not selected. Wu's right back position is not only the best in the country, but also the best in the Far East. This is a consensus among people inside and outside the circle. I am not talking nonsense. The current right back who was selected is Hou Rongsheng. Hou's skills are good, but he is still one level behind Wu. Hou can still be listed as an official representative, but Wu's name is not on the list. How can this be considered fair? Regarding this point, I don't know how the selectors can justify themselves."

### Neurosis

— Jingwen

These few days, the newspapers are full of news about neurotics, which makes people laugh, although the parties do not admit that they are neurotic, and even accuse others of being neurotic. However, one claims to be some kind of Lord, advocating the banning of revolutionary parties and even gigolos from various countries, and the other asks the court to appraise others as having a mental illness out of thin air. Regardless of whether these behaviors are out of momentary playfulness, there is no doubt that their spirit lacks health. Because a mentally normal person will never have such absurd words and deeds, even if it is to find pleasure and prank, there is probably a range. Although I dare not say that they are definitely suffering from mental illness, it is probably not wrong to say that they are mentally disturbed (even if it is occasional).

According to the opinions of psychoanalysts, eight or nine out of ten people living in modern cities suffer from mental disorders, only the degree is light or heavy, and the time is long or short, and because they sympathize with each other, everyone is not easy to detect. For example, hysteria was once thought to be only a disease that women would commit, but now we know that both men and women are the same. Especially in speculative places, if you can observe coldly, almost everyone is suffering from varying degrees of hysteria. Just think of the scene of impermanent joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, isn't it the most powerful evidence?

The nerve endurance of people is originally limited, but the stimulation in urban social life is endless. Not to mention anything else, we only need to open the newspaper every day, and we don't know how much news is enough to hurt our brains. The fighting on the international stage, the fighting on the battlefield, as well as the yellow, pink, and gray social news, and economic news that directly affects life, etc., which one does not make people feel mental stimulation.

Some people may think that the more dynamic and complex social life is, the more it indicates the richness and vitality of human life. For example, children who grow up in cities are much smarter and more lively than children in rural areas. Adults in cities look younger than men and women in the countryside of similar age. Men in their forties still have a slicked-back hair, and mothers with four or five children, relying on the superb skills of makeup, can be sisters with their children.

These are indeed facts, at least they seem to be so in appearance. Because a tense and changeable life does have the feeling of rejuvenation in the spirit. In highly urbanized societies such as the United Kingdom and the United States, some people have proposed that life begins at forty or even seventy. However, it is also an undeniable fact that there are far more people with neurosis in urban societies than in rural areas.

However, although urban life easily makes people suffer from neurasthenia, it is not without a cure. If everyone can see the meaning of life more clearly and see everything more naturally, then although urban life is tense, your mind can still maintain a considerable amount of tranquility, and naturally it will not cause mental disorders. Because the tension and stimulation of urban life are just man-made things. We often see many people rushing around all day long, walking like they are rushing to a funeral, eating without tasting the taste, looking at their watches every few minutes, almost smashing the phone when the phone doesn't work, and rushing across the road when the red light is on, and rushing on the tram is like charging into battle. These people's lives are really terrible. But is he really doing something extraordinary? Ninety-nine percent may not be. They are just because they have been tormenting their nerves in a tense atmosphere for a long time, so any sesame-sized thing, he can't help but deal with it with a tense attitude.

I am not saying that there is absolutely nothing in life that requires concentrating all one's attention on. Now is the scientific world, and most of the work requires the correct time coordination, so it is sometimes necessary to be nervous. However, before mankind was baptized by scientific civilization, they lived the same life for thousands of years, and it is still the case in rural societies today. The highest goal of scientific civilization was originally to improve people's lives and well-being. It is the result of human creation, so it should still be controlled by people. If you are controlled by it instead, you will inevitably become a victim of scientific civilization. All people with neurasthenia, if they can understand how to use a natural attitude to control scientific civilization and urban life, I dare to guarantee that he can recover in no time.

### Serious

— Why Bother

During this period, we often see a familiar word in newspapers: "Serious." For example, "The situation is serious," "a serious expression," and so on. If the frequent appearance of the word "serious" in newspapers is not a blessing for the people, it is not an exaggeration. Because ordinary people like to live a peaceful and easy life, and they are most afraid of seriousness and difficulty. Once something becomes serious, there must be difficulties. If "smiles" could come with "seriousness," wouldn't that be wonderful? However, this is just talking to oneself behind closed doors. Not everything can go as one wishes, which is why "seriousness" causes living beings to frown.

However, half of the serious things in the world are due to the awkwardness of the situation itself, and the other half is caused by the subjective state of mind. Let's start from a small perspective: I pride myself on having calculation skills, so even a small expense like a pack of cigarettes must be recorded in my daily accounts. Many people have long denied the usefulness of keeping petty cash accounts. In the past, people kept petty cash accounts in order to achieve balance in their expenses, with the intention of living within their means. Since large banknotes appeared and savings disappeared, keeping petty cash accounts has become even more of an outdated practice. I am determined to stick to it, not because I am clinging to the past and not open-minded enough, but because I have high self-esteem and want to start from small things. However, this petty cash account, although recorded every day, is often inaccurate. Today, it might be tens of thousands of yuan too much, and yesterday, it might be fifty thousand yuan too little. Sometimes, because the numbers are inaccurate, I bury myself in thought, trying to recover a forgotten expense from my thoughts. The suffering is not different from that of a great scientist brainstorming for a difficult equation. And the outward seriousness often surprises an uninvited friend: "What's wrong, old friend? Why are you so serious in deep thought?" A friend can't help but think that way.

In fact, what's so serious about it when you think it through? If the account is inaccurate, forget it. A difference of tens of thousands of yuan is just personal petty cash, not embezzlement of public funds, so there's no need to think so hard. It is said that the founder of "pushing and knocking" spent three years considering whether to use "the monk knocks on the moonlit gate" or "a monk pushes on the moonlit gate." So when he later decided to use "the monk knocks on the moonlit gate," he wrote four more lines: "Two lines took three years to get, one chant brings double tears, if the connoisseur does not understand, I will return to my old mountain in autumn." He took his own writings so seriously. However, this is the eternal chanting of a great poet, and it is worth taking seriously. What is my petty cash account? Why bother frowning and thinking hard for a mere tens of thousands of yuan, unable to understand myself? Even utilitarians would probably sneer at me for not thinking so hard for these insignificant sums.

Therefore, when it comes to seriousness, one must be able to see things openly. The one who ties the bell must untie it. Many major events are just petty cash accounts under a magnifying glass. If you can see things openly, it won't be serious. As for matters that are inherently serious, please forgive me for not daring to discuss them, as they involve major plans and cannot be "easily resolved" with nonsensical talk.

### Anecdotes of Zhang Taiyan

— Qian Dacheng

Zhang Taiyan was a revolutionary literary master and a great scholar of his time, known as "Zhang the Madman." His anecdotes are scattered among the people, but the records in Qian Jibo's "History of Modern Chinese Literature" are the most detailed. Mr. Jin Shuyuan, from the same village, once worked with Taiyan at Soochow University in the late Qing Dynasty. He recounted his anecdotes, which were not known to the public, so I wrote them down in this article:

Taiyan was devoted to scholarship and did not understand worldly affairs. Among his colleagues, he only praised Huang Moses from Changshu as someone he could discuss scholarship with, and he would talk to him incessantly all night long. Others did not understand what the two of them were talking about. Moses was also a remarkable person, and I will write about him in another article. Taiyan once said: "Scholars must have a brain disease to achieve success in scholarship; I also have a brain disease."

When Taiyan was in Suzhou, he had already cut off his queue, which made people stare at him, so he wore a fake queue on his hat, but he did not sew it onto the hat, but rather embedded it inside the hat. Whenever he went to the market street, the fake queue often fell to the ground, which made people stare at him even more. He also did not know the way, and he often got lost from Tianci Village to Guanqian. The colleagues bet with each other, saying: "If Taiyan can go from Tianci Village to Guanqian without getting lost and without dropping his queue, we will treat him to a sumptuous feast." In the end, no one dared to make this bet. It is said that when he was in Shanghai, he also got lost and could not find his way home. He went to ask a police officer, saying: "Where is my home?" The police officer found it strange. He became furious and said: "Don't you even know where my home is?" So he was taken to the police station, and after asking his name, he was sent home.

Taiyan did not pay much attention to washing and bathing. His hair grew several inches long, and he did not know how to groom himself. His colleague Zhu would tell him every month or so: "It's time to get a haircut." He would say: "Okay." Then he would get a haircut, and Zhu would pay for the haircut. This happened many times. One day, he suddenly said to Mr. Shuyuan: "Is his surname Zhu?" Shuyuan laughed and said: "He has paid for your haircuts many times, and you still don't recognize him?"

Years ago, when I was in Wuxi, I heard Taiyan give a lecture. He was calm and composed, with a slightly nasal voice. He kept smoking cigarettes while lecturing. Once, he wanted to stand up and write on the blackboard, but he mistook the cigarette for a piece of chalk. After writing and sitting down to lecture again, he mistook the chalk for a cigarette and put it in his mouth to smoke. The audience couldn't help but burst into laughter.

### My Fantasy

— Cicada

Although the post-war world is still filled with the smell of gunpowder, most war-weary people have shifted their interests from war to other things.

Today, besides the war, the most attention-grabbing thing should be the upcoming World Games. According to my estimation, there are probably more people who care about the World Games than those who care about the current situation. In fact, this is a welcome phenomenon.

War is nothing more than a measurement of strength between countries. However, it inevitably involves countless innocent people and many beautiful towns being reduced to ashes in the flames of war. From a purely humanitarian point of view, war should indeed be abolished. However, when two countries negotiate to the point of blushing faces and their interests clash to the point where they can only be resolved by force, there is no other way to follow but to fight to the death.

However, is war the only way to measure the strength between two countries? No! There is also sports. From sports, one can see the physical strength of a country's people and a country's true strength. Then the upcoming World Games is almost equivalent to a world war, and the honor and disgrace of each country can be judged here. Being able to dominate the World Games is truly a strong country. All strong countries should have healthy citizens. Don't we often shout that a strong country must first have a strong race?

If future international conflicts—no matter what they are for—are not resolved by war, but by sports competitions, that would be the greatest blessing for mankind! Unfortunately, it is just my fantasy.

### American Women and the Law

— Huanren

In Macon, Georgia, it is a criminal offense for a man to put his arm around a woman without a valid reason.

In Nappanee, Indiana, it is against the law to hang women's underwear on a clothesline.

In New Mexico, women must be bathed and combed before going out on the street, or it is against the law.

In Whitesville, Delaware, it is considered improper to propose to a woman during a leap year.

In Hershey, Maryland, kissing for more than one second is illegal.

In Monroe, Utah, couples must dance in the light.

In Evanston, Illinois, it is a major violation of the law for women to change clothes in a car without lowering the window curtains. However, other towns do not have such laws.

In Zion, Illinois, dancing or similar acts in the street are against the law, and the sale of high heels and lipstick is strictly prohibited.

Also, in Lebanon, Tennessee, a husband has no right to kick his wife out of bed, even if her feet are terribly cold. But on the wife's side, she can kick her husband out of bed whenever she pleases, for no reason at all.

### Seajiang Building Poetry Collection

— Xu Banmeng

Two occasional rhymes

Green bamboo hat, green bamboo raincoat, an old fisherman comes home to cast his fishing rod. Coming home unaware of the rising west wind, ten thousand miles of long sky a wild goose flies.

On the desolate river, there are many tigers and wolves. Heaven and earth are closed, what can be done. The virtuous men are hidden, the gentlemen's way is gone, the setting sun suddenly goes to the Central Plains, where does the sad wind roll the evening tide!

Waking up

Waking up, a dream sunk leisurely, no place to find a confidant on the desolate road. Usually, I only embrace the habit of watching mountains, today only the remaining heart of carving sentences. The day is long, often because the birds are silent, the path is secluded, more lining the falling flowers deep. In the midst of chaos, there is still the interest of the righteous emperor, forgetting everything, a light and distant mind

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14 Carefree on the Sea (2)

Zhu Zhai had already prepared many words in his heart while on the carriage, how he should speak to Yunqing, how he should plead with her if she did not agree, and make her speechless, and she would surely agree to me. Although Fengsheng's expression today is annoying, if things take a turn for the better because of this, then a blessing in disguise. I think this time, there will definitely be a result. Zhu Zhai was thinking on the way, and when the carriage arrived at the door, he rang the doorbell. Auntie Li came out to open the door, and when she saw it was Zhu Zhai, she first said: "Miss has gone to Tianjin." Zhu Zhai couldn't help but be stunned and said: "When did she go to Tianjin?" Auntie Li said: "Didn't she send you a letter?" Zhu Zhai said: "I didn't receive her letter." As he spoke, he walked straight upstairs, not really believing it in his heart, and felt that Auntie Li's words might not be reliable. Upstairs, he walked straight into Yunqing's bedroom. He saw that the furnishings in the room were still the same, only the bedding on the bed and the books on the desk had all been packed away. When he looked at the photograph under the glass on the table, it was also gone. He knew that Yunqing had indeed gone to Tianjin, and this trip would not be a short one. He sighed deeply and asked, "Did Miss say when she would be back?" Auntie Li said: "She didn't say. She took a lot of clothes with her this time when she went to Tianjin, so she probably won't be back soon!" Zhu Zhai nodded and looked around the room. Although everything was the same, the house felt desolate with the person gone. He felt very sad in his heart. When he saw Auntie Li looking at him blankly, he had to say, "I didn't expect Miss to go to Tianjin too." Auntie Li said: "If you have anything to say, you can write a letter to our Miss. Tianjin is not far from here, you can go to Tianjin to find her." Zhu Zhai reluctantly responded and walked to the door. Auntie Li knew that he was sad and said, "I'll call you and tell you when Miss returns." Zhu Zhai nodded, got into the carriage, and felt so empty in his heart, as if he was falling into the sea, drifting in the midst of huge waves, not knowing where to drift. He really wanted to find a wilderness and cry loudly to feel better. At this moment, he had no attachment in his heart, so he ordered the driver to drive straight to the Wu Gongwei's house.

### Lord Sa's Great Celebration (Part 2)

— Qinglei Academy

In the early years of the Qing Dynasty's Xuantong reign, there was an initial discussion about restoring the navy. The princes and nobles were in power. Prince Regent Zaifeng's younger brother, Zaixun, was young and enthusiastic. He went abroad to inspect the navy and, upon his return, began planning. Everything was vague and uncertain. He earnestly invited the old General Sa to jointly plan, and after some progress, the Ministry of Navy was established, with Zaixun as the minister (i.e., the head) and Tan Xueheng as the vice minister. However, there was no suitable position for old Sa in the capital. He was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the fleet, which was a good system, but it was an external appointment. In the early years of the Republic of China, old Yuan relied on his military strength to support his regime, and he trusted Mr. Liu Guanxiong, appointing him as the Minister of Navy. He respected old Sa's detached style, but kept him at a distance. When Yuan died and Li succeeded him, Cheng Fengguang became the Minister of Navy, and old Sa still did not have any power over military affairs. His relationship with the political situation and the navy was always vague and distant. However, when people talked about the navy's veteran, no one did not mention Sa Zhenbing. The public's respect for him was due to historical reasons.

In the autumn of the year before the founding of the Republic of China, the Wuchang Revolutionary Army rose up, and Governor Rui Cheng fled, and the provincial capital fell. The Qing court was greatly shocked and urgently ordered Minister of the Army Yin Chang to lead two Zhen of the Beiyang Army to the south, and also ordered Sa Zhenbing to lead the Yangtze River Fleet to advance by land and water. Old Sa and Li Yuanhong had a teacher-student relationship. Old Li gave old Sa a letter, earnestly stating the great righteousness. Old Sa's attitude was not very active, and at this point, he absolutely refused to confront the Revolutionary Army. On the army side, the command shifted from Yin Chang to old Yuan. Old Yuan had other plans in his mind. When the Qing Dynasty abdicated and the Republic of China was established, some people recommended old Sa, but old Yuan said that good people were useless, so he gave the navy's power to Liu Guanxiong. Mr. Liu helped old Yuan with all his might, and his personal wealth also greatly relied on old Yuan's support. Liu and Sa's calm and quiet styles were completely different.

In the "Biographies of Contemporary Celebrities" (written by Ward, published in Shanghai in the past), Sa Zhenbing is described as "simple and frugal, morally upright and clean, riding in a rickshaw without escorts, never speaking deceptive words in his life, but lacking in strength and decisiveness, so although he was appointed to an important position early on, his authority was not exercised." These words are all accurate. This is why he was a "strange military man" and a "lonely official." I remember that in the twenty-second year, the leaders of the 19th Route Army and some politicians in Fujian organized the so-called People's Government and divided the entire province into many districts, and they recommended old Sa as one of the provincial governors. From a distance, this could not be known in detail, but judging from his past style, he would definitely say yes, take office, and be indifferent, adapting to circumstances. This organization soon disintegrated, and old Sa's village scholar demeanor and old woman's face remained the same. He was "indifferent" and "unrelated."

"Biographies of Celebrities" also says: "His son returned from studying in the United States, and he hosted a banquet to treat him, and raised his glass and said: 'From now on, father and son will live separately and each govern themselves. This banquet is to bid you farewell and wish you self-reliance.' Those watching all covered their mouths." According to the fact that his son has returned to the country after completing his studies, it is the starting point for serving the country and society. Modern civilization is different from the old feudal system. People are citizens, not parasites of the family. Parents' education of their children has a certain limit. Children should support their parents, but they cannot be attached to them outside of the country and society. Sa Weng's actions were in line with reason and fact, but could not be understood by stubborn minds, so they covered their mouths and laughed. Judging from this incident alone, Sa Weng had his own ideas in his mind, that is, his naval knowledge and naval plans were also very skilled, but for all kinds of current positions, there were too many things that were like child's play, which could not be taken seriously, coupled with his peaceful nature, he was even more happy to perfunctorily deal with it. Sa Weng was certainly not a great hero, but there are often people who are truly promising, but are disdainful of reality and content with negativity.

Social Service

### Answers to Questions about Military Service (3) Written by the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau

(5) Regarding technicians: Any eligible draftees who want to use the reason of being a technician to postpone their service must submit their graduation certificate from a specialized school and their certificate of being a technical staff member of an institution or factory, or a technician certification, to apply for postponement of service. However, technical workers do not refer to the general term, but must be within the scope of applicable exemptions for specialized technical workers in national defense industries promulgated by the Executive Yuan to be considered qualified. This review is based on the registration certificate of technical workers from the Labor Bureau and the certificate of serving in a technical position in an institution or factory. Without the two types of certificates mentioned above, they cannot be recognized as meeting the regulations for technical workers related to national defense and cannot be granted exemptions.

(6) Regarding primary school teachers: Primary school teachers applying for deferment of service must submit their primary school teacher registration certificate and employment letter, and they must also be verified against the list qualified by the Education Bureau to be considered qualified. None of the applications for primary school teachers in this city in the 36th year submitted registration certificates, only school certificates, which are not in compliance with the law and must be supplemented.

(7) Regarding the provisions of Article 26, Paragraph 5 of the Military Service Law: Article 26, Paragraph 5 of the Military Service Law stipulates that "those who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their family and have no siblings, or have siblings who have all been conscripted or are all under the age of eighteen" may be granted deferment. The focus of this article is on the phrase "solely responsible for the livelihood of their family." If there are no draftees who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their family, even if they are the only son, they must still serve in the military. Conversely, even if there are several brothers, but the oldest of them is still under the age of eighteen, they can also apply for deferment. The Civil Affairs Bureau, seeing that the scope of this article was too broad, after considering the actual situation, formulated the Shanghai Municipal Standard for Solely Responsible for Family Livelihood as the basis for review. However, when reviewing this application, the most common phenomenon was that local Baojia chiefs could not know whether they actually had siblings and what the family's economic situation was. However, many were able to attach proof from the Baojia chief of their original residence or attach proof from the person in charge of the factory or firm, and we approved them. Because the majority of our people are in the poor class, as long as the father is over 58 years old, the younger brother is under 18 years old, and there are no other colleagues in production, they are all allowed to defer service. In addition, there are many draftees whose fathers and brothers are not yet up to the above-mentioned age, but because of illness or disability, they cannot produce, they are also considered to meet the standard of being solely responsible for the family livelihood and can be allowed deferment for the same reason.
