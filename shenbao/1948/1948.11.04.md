### U.S. Election Results Announced: Truman Re-elected President, Dewey Concedes Defeat and Withdraws from Race

[Special Dispatch] New York, 3rd (Radio): Dewey has just announced his withdrawal from the election, conceding the presidency to Truman. At that time, Truman had secured 304 electoral votes, leading in 26 states; Dewey had only 189 votes, leading in 16 states.

Upon hearing the news of Dewey's withdrawal in Kansas City, Truman smiled and kissed his brother. Truman's victory this time is a political miracle of the 20th century, completely unexpected; even Dewey and those around him did not anticipate it. Moreover, not only did Truman win, but the Democratic Party has also gained control of Congress. Therefore, Truman will have more power in formulating U.S. foreign policy.

Another Dispatch: Dewey has just sent a telegram to Truman congratulating him. The telegram reads: "Congratulations on your re-election as President. I wish you every success in the future. I also urge all American people to unite and support you in safeguarding America's freedom and strength, and in establishing world peace." (Please see Page 3)

### A Brief Biography of Truman

Harry Truman was born in Lamar, Missouri, on May 8, 1884. He spent many years of his youth on farms, which is why he gained the favor of farmers during his campaign.

In his youth, Truman worked in various industries. During World War I, he served as a captain in an artillery unit, experiencing life and death on the battlefield, which helped him understand the attitudes and needs of the "middle class."

Truman's first political career began in November 1922 when he was elected judge of the Jackson County Court. In 1934, he was elected senator, and again in 1940. During World War II, he advocated for the establishment of a "Committee Investigating the National Defense Program." The proposal was immediately passed, and he took office as chairman, earning national acclaim and the favor of Roosevelt. Later, when Roosevelt was re-elected for his sixth term, Truman also ascended to the vice presidency.

On the afternoon of April 12, 1945, Roosevelt suddenly died of a stroke, and Truman became president.

In his first year in the White House, Truman won popular support. The United Nations Charter was passed in San Francisco, the war was won, and the post-war reconstruction began.

In 1946, Truman encountered many new difficulties, and both houses of Congress fell under the control of the Republican Party.

The Democratic National Convention finally nominated Truman as the presidential candidate for this term on the morning of June 15 of this year in Philadelphia.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The adjusted prices for postal and telecommunications and railway passenger and freight rates, based on the Supplementary Measures for Economic Reform, were passed at the Political Affairs Conference on the 3rd. Except for postal and telecommunications, which will be implemented on a scheduled basis after being passed by the Legislative Yuan, the new electricity rates and railway passenger and freight rates will all be implemented on the 6th.

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has now telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments to provide price data. In areas that have implemented economic controls in the past, the coal price must be approved by the government.

### John Leighton Stuart Arrives in Shanghai Tonight; Urges U.S. to Adopt Strong Political Assistance to China

[Dispatch from this City] John Leighton Stuart, the Director of the ECA China Mission, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the United States tonight (the 4th). Stuart left China on October 10, and he has consulted with President Truman and ECA Administrator Hoffman in the United States.

[Central News Agency, New York, 2nd] The New York Times published a report from its San Francisco correspondent on the front page today under a two-line headline regarding Stuart's remarks on November 1st: "ECA China Mission Director Urges Us to Fully Assist China." Stuart also suggested revising the U.S. policy towards China today, saying, "Our middle-ground policy is not achieving any success." He then advocated that we should provide definite assistance, control the aid funds, and assume full responsibility for the use of the funds in economic and military aspects. He continued, "The situation is increasingly unfavorable for the Chinese government. Since June, the overall situation has deteriorated." Stuart also said that actively assisting China so that it does not fall into the hands of the Communists is in America's interest. "I do not believe that abandoning China is in America's best interest. China (especially North China) is the most important part of Asia. We are currently blocking the Iron Curtain in Korea, so it is logical to allocate a considerable amount of ECA funds to resist the Iron Curtain throughout the Pacific, just as in the Atlantic." Stuart also said that the best opportunity to avoid a hot war is to spend money on the "Cold War" to help people who are willing to resist totalitarianism. He concluded, "I am not saying that every Chinese Communist soldier is a follower of Marx, but the leadership of the CCP is in step with Moscow."

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Cleveland, the Director of the ECA China Aid Program, is expected to return to ECA headquarters within the week. He will report on his investigation of the ECA's work in China.

### Walter Judd Discusses the Fall of the Northeast; Says It Is a Replay of the Pearl Harbor Incident

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] U.S. Representative and member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Walter Judd declared on the 3rd that the fall of the Northeast is a replay of the Pearl Harbor incident and has become "the most serious danger" to U.S. security. The failure of the Chinese government also threatens the security of anti-communist countries in the Pacific and Europe. He predicted that if the Soviet Union controls the entire China through the Communists, the United States must increase its expenditures by billions of dollars to "defend Alaska," maintain the independence of the Philippines, and protect the freedom of Japan. Judd said that if the Communists continue to be rampant in the East, the Soviet Union will be able to concentrate its efforts on a major offensive. He severely criticized Marshall and the State Department's policies for China's perilous situation.

[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] According to General David Barr, commander of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, there are 575 dependents of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Nanjing and 321 in Shanghai. Difficulties seem inevitable this winter. One hundred people will return to the United States in the near future. More people will also leave China when regularly scheduled military transport ships are available, but there is no need to send special ships. All those returning home, except for those whose terms have expired, are doing so voluntarily and are not being evacuated. Due to the current turbulent situation, there is a shortage of housing, fuel, and other necessities. No more dependents of the Advisory Group will come to China in the future.

### Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses Diplomacy; Hopes to Strengthen Sino-U.S. Relations; Accuses Diplomatic Authorities of Mediocrity and Misleading the Country

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a plenary meeting on the 3rd to broadly discuss the Sino-U.S. relations issue within the "Review of Diplomatic Policy" case. Rong Xi chaired the meeting, and the committee members spoke enthusiastically. It was generally believed that Sino-U.S. relations urgently needed to be strengthened. It was pointed out that diplomatic policy should be determined based on national interests, and many condemned the diplomatic authorities for their mediocrity, which led to ambiguous and fence-sitting diplomacy in the past, seriously misleading the country. China has fought the Communists for twenty years, serving as an anti-communist vanguard, yet it has not been able to obtain the full cooperation and assistance of the United States, which holds the same anti-communist policy. This is all due to errors in diplomatic operations. In the future, China's direction should be clearly declared. The enhancement of Sino-U.S. relations cannot rely solely on traditional friendship. We must actively form an anti-communist group in Asia. The U.S. government and public will give Europe and the Far East equal importance.

Editorial

### Note on the Tokyo Tribunal's Sentencing

The Tokyo Tribunal, lasting twenty-three and a half months since its conclusion, has the world's public opinion anticipating the pronouncement of the Japanese war crimes, preparing for a final fair evaluation. According to recent Allied sources: the judgment of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East has been drafted and will be pronounced as soon as the translation work is completed, around the middle of this month. Furthermore, according to the Washington dispatch prediction of the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun": those likely to be sentenced to death are Hideki Tojo, Akira Muto, Teiichi Suzuki, Shigeru Shimada, Seishiro Itagaki, Kenji Doihara, and six others, totaling twelve; those likely to be acquitted are Mamoru Shigemitsu, Yoshijiro Umezu, and Koki Kaya, three in total; Shunroku Hata is between a death sentence and acquittal, likely sentenced to detention; Jiro Minami and Iwane Matsui are likely to be sentenced to imprisonment. If this prediction is correct, the punishment of Japanese war criminals will still not have fully met the standards of fairness and rationality.

Punishing war criminals is a major event after the end of World War II. The establishment of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East is the responsible organization for trying Class A war criminals, following the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, commonly known as the Tokyo Tribunal. The Far East Tribunal filed indictments against twenty-eight (now only twenty-five) Class A war criminals, including Tojo and Hirota, on April 29, 1946, which lasted for over two years. The trial only concluded on April 16 this year, and there has been no sentence until now, which fully illustrates the consistent delays and laxity over the past two years, which is deeply regrettable. As the Chinese judge Mei Ru'ao said: "I have indeed noticed that, given the rapid changes in the world situation over the past two years, the Tokyo Tribunal has lost most of its political significance, but I deeply hope that it will not lose its legal and historical significance." This is a very insightful prediction. Compared with the Nuremberg trials of the Nazis, the legal and political significance of the Tokyo Tribunal, which cannot be ignored, has been weakened, leaving only some historical traces for future generations to mourn.

Legally speaking, the trial system adopted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East is very thorough and ideal. However, the final decision on criminal punishment and its execution must be carried out by the Supreme Commander (referring to MacArthur) by order, which is unreasonable. According to regulations: the Supreme Commander may reduce or otherwise alter the penalties pronounced by the court at any time, but may not increase them; this is tantamount to saying that the court's judgment is not the final judgment for execution, and must be approved by the Supreme Commander before it can be executed. There are currently twenty-five Class A war criminals, and it is predicted that only twelve, including Tojo, will be sentenced to death, and Minami and Matsui will be imprisoned, while the others have great flexibility between guilty and not guilty. Given MacArthur's current indifferent attitude towards the tribunal, it is doubtful whether the sentences of death or imprisonment pronounced by the court will be reduced or delayed in the future. Therefore, it is said that the form of the Tokyo Tribunal is thorough and ideal, and in line with academic value, but in fact, the essence of the Tokyo Tribunal is to adopt a military dictatorship's adjudication system, where consciousness can change the law, and orders can change the law. Not only the deaths of war criminals, but also the dignity and sanctity of the law, are entrusted to MacArthur's final change of mind. Therefore, we are not comfortable being too optimistic about the upcoming results of the Tokyo Tribunal.

Politically speaking, the punishment of war criminals is to establish a principle for future generations, that "aggressive war is a crime," and it is not just a punishment for war criminals with the death penalty, but also has a warning significance for preventing war. Considering the identities and positions of the twenty-five Class A war criminals, as well as the broad political responsibilities they bore in the war, there is no doubt that they are all aggressors in the war. Even Shumei Okawa, who is exempt from prosecution, cannot escape the fact of the crime of aggression. Mamoru Shigemitsu, who is predicted to be acquitted, is an aggressive diplomat and strategist who served as Minister of the "Greater East Asia Ministry" and planned aggressive affairs. His crimes are the same as those of Koki Hirota and should be sentenced to death. Yoshijiro Umezu is a war criminal who invaded China. During his tenure as Commander of the Kwantung Army, he forced China to sign regional agreements, nibbled away at eastern Hebei, and invaded North China. His crimes are the same as those of Kenji Doihara and should be sentenced to death. Koki Kaya is the Finance Minister of the aggressive cabinet and a planner of aggressive war. He is also a bridge between the financial groups and the warlords. He served as the president of the "North China Development Company," turning China into a slave state. His crimes are the same as those of Teiichi Suzuki and should be sentenced to death. Shunroku Hata served as the Army Minister of the aggressive cabinet and the Supreme Commander of the Central China Expeditionary Army. He led a large army to invade North China and the Southwest. His crimes are the same as those of Seishiro Itagaki and should be sentenced to death. Jiro Minami was in charge of Korea and served as the Commander of the Kwantung Army, invading the Northeast; Iwane Matsui, during his tenure as the Supreme Commander of the Central China Army, massacred Nanjing, creating the greatest tragedy in the history of aggressive war. In any case, he should be sentenced to death. Their crimes should not only be sentenced to death legally, but also cannot be reduced or suspended politically, otherwise the political significance of the Tokyo Tribunal will be completely lost.

In short, the Tokyo Tribunal has reached its final moment, and world public opinion is paying close attention to it. In particular, the Chinese people have suffered the deepest oppression from the invasion of Japanese warlords, so they feel infinite concern and attention to the outcome of the trial. Today, the Allied headquarters' indifferent attitude towards the Tokyo Tribunal is extremely worrying; we hope that the Allied governments and Allied personnel will unanimously advocate for public justice, promptly announce the crimes of this group of war criminals to the world as soon as possible, and severely punish them, establish peace for the world, and uphold justice for mankind. This is our wish for the Tokyo Tribunal.

### Wuxi Various Industries Still Closed and Suspended Sales; Rice Prices Surge and Then Fall Back; Zhejiang Province Abolishes Food Control Measures

Wuxi [Report from our newspaper on the 3rd] The shops in this area are all closed and suspended sales as they wait to negotiate prices. The rice market was quite lively on the morning of the 3rd.

### Registering Chinese Nationals' Assets in the United States: Kong Xiangxi Expresses Sincere Support, Zhang Pingqun Discusses Three Difficulties in Implementation

[Our New York, October 27th Dispatch] Mr. Kong Xiangxi, a resident of New York, stated to Zhang Pingqun, the Consul-General in New York, that he sincerely supports the central government's new monetary reform plan. If the relevant institutions and organizations in New York are ready and the procedures are well-planned, Mr. Kong is willing to be the first to register his assets in the United States, setting an example for the overseas Chinese community. However, Mr. Kong declined Consul-General Zhang's invitation to serve as a guiding committee member for asset registration.

According to Consul-General Zhang's conversation with reporters, the guiding committee was originally planned to be composed of five people. In addition to the Consul-General, Zhang Pingqun had invited Kong Xiangxi and Li Guoqin, but both firmly declined, so the "committee" has not been established to date. Mr. Zhang believes that the greatest difficulty in registering overseas deposits is the restrictions of New York State law (according to US law, different states have different regulations). New York State law stipulates that no foreign bank may accept deposits or conduct deposit business. The Bank of China in New York has only handled remittances for many years, not accepting deposits, and this is the reason. Zhang Pingqun believes that the government's purpose in registering overseas assets is to increase the government's foreign exchange reserves and prepare for borrowing and allocation when necessary. If the Bank of China in New York cannot accept deposits, all the assets of Chinese nationals in New York will still be held by American banks. Then, "what is the use of even a formal document registering numbers?" Therefore, Consul-General Zhang believes that the most urgent step today is to negotiate with Washington through the central government, or with the US State Department through the embassy, to allow the United States to lift the restrictions on the Bank of China in New York to accept deposits.

Consul-General Zhang also mentioned that Li Guoqin has repeatedly expressed his support for the government's asset registration decree, but Mr. Li also has practical difficulties. As a major businessman in New York, his assets are constantly being transferred and turned over. Li himself has deposits, but also has debts. This is what is called "assets" and "liabilities" in accounting. Li Guoqin has repeatedly stated clearly that if the government wants him to register his assets, he must also register his liabilities at the same time. Consul-General Zhang believes that in addition to Li Guoqin, there are many others in the same situation, which is another difficulty in implementing the order.

The third difficulty, Consul-General Zhang believes, is the interpretation of the term "overseas Chinese." How to handle the case of American Chinese citizens with dual nationality? This difficulty was discussed by Minister Wang Yunwu at a press conference when he passed through New York a month ago. Minister Wang believes that it still needs careful study. As for the first two difficulties, Consul-General Zhang had informed Minister Wang in detail and asked the government to study the matter further.

Zhang Pingqun told our reporter that he is determined to implement the government order seriously and will not shirk or neglect his duties. However, the United States is an extremely liberal country, and the government does not have special extraterritorial rights to interfere with or manage the actions of its citizens, especially not to interfere with any private economic life. Most people in the country are well aware of this situation. Zhang hopes that given time and careful handling, something can be achieved.

### Democratic Party Wins Unexpectedly Big Victory, Controls Both Houses of US Congress, Also Holds Absolute Advantage in Gubernatorial Elections

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] In this election, the Democratic Party not only obtained a very large number of votes nationwide, but has also gained control of the Senate, and seems certain to regain a majority in the House of Representatives. This is truly an unexpected major change. The various predictions made in advance by those conducting public opinion polls and political commentators have all been overturned. They are now rushing to explain the reasons for the Democratic Party's sudden victory: (1) The labor vote is more powerful than before; (2) The number of votes supporting the Progressive Party or the Socialist Party is less than expected; (3) Strong local Democratic senatorial or gubernatorial candidates have helped the national election vote; (4) Farmers voting for the Republican Party are not as numerous as expected. The biggest impression we have is that the late President Roosevelt's New Deal still has a major effect on American voters. It is generally believed that Truman's repeated statements that the Democratic Party adheres to Roosevelt's New Deal measures have had an effect and gained the support of many neutral voters. As for the Republican Party's low vote count in this election, it may reflect a lot. American voters still do not trust the party's domestic performance. Truman's constant attacks on the Republican-controlled 80th Congress may have had an effect. Regardless of whether Truman is elected, the unusually large number of votes he received has given the Democratic Party new life.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The Democratic National Committee announced on the 3rd that the Democratic Party has controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives in the next Congress.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The Democratic Party today broke the 48-48 deadlock in the Senate and has firmly grasped control. In the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party has also won a majority of 218 seats. After all the ballots are counted, an ample majority can be used. The Democratic Party has won 49 seats in the Senate and is still leading in three other states. Forty-nine seats are the majority in the Senate, and the overall situation is set. The American people have surprisingly transformed Congress and call Truman "the second worst in American history."

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The Democratic Party's surprising resurgence has also affected gubernatorial elections. In the nation's 48 states, the Democratic Party has won at least 31 states, compared to a 24-24 tie before.

### Bachelier Reveals Intention to Retire, Regardless of Who Wins the Election, the US Will Still Pursue Bipartisan Diplomacy

Marshall replied that he did indeed have the ambition to resign and return to his hometown, but he refused to state frankly whether he intended to retire permanently after the new president takes office in January next year.

However, his aides pointed out that even if Truman is re-elected, Marshall will still submit his resignation with the entire cabinet on January 20. This has been the practice for a long time, so that the president can reorganize the cabinet. Marshall and Dewey's foreign policy advisor Dulles sat side by side at the UN General Assembly this morning, listening to reports of the domestic election. Marshall leaned back in his chair, rocking back and forth slightly.

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] An Australian representative explained the reason for Truman's lead, saying, "This shows that the American people love people with fighting spirit."

However, Vyshinsky applauded after Nehru's speech ended. Nehru will fly to Cairo on the 3rd.

### New Plan to Enforce Truce in Holy Land, Security Council to Discuss Today, Israel Denies Conducting Peace Negotiations with Arabs

### International Statistical Convention, Spain Included in Signatory Countries

[French News Agency, Paris, 2nd] The UN Political Committee today passed the Argentine proposal to cancel the previous resolution not to include Spain in the UN statistical survey with 21 votes to 14 and 12 abstentions. Although the Soviet bloc tried its best to oppose it, it was still ineffective. Spain can therefore be one of the signatory countries to the International Economic Statistics Convention. Observers believe that although this convention has no major political relationship, this vote can be used as a precedent for future votes.

### ECA Loans to Turkey, 30 Million US Dollars

[French News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The ECA has recently allocated another 30 million US dollars in loans to Turkey, so the total amount of allocations has reached 797 million US dollars.

### Japanese Major War Criminal Tojo May Be Executed, Tokyo International Tribunal Pronounces Sentence Today

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The Far East International Tribunal, which is trying Tojo and other 24 Class A Japanese war criminals, will meet at 1:30 a.m. on the 4th (Tokyo time) to pass the verdict on the defendants. There is a lot of speculation about the fate of this group of war criminals, but there is no real hint, because this judgment is absolutely confidential. This trial has lasted for more than two years and has not yet been convicted. Observers familiar with the court believe that Tojo will be sentenced to death. They also believe that some of them may also be sentenced to death, and one or two of them may be acquitted. It is generally believed that the former ambassador to the Soviet Union and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Aoi during the Tojo cabinet may have a chance to be acquitted, but this is just speculation.

### Conflict Between South Korean Military Police

[United Press, Seoul, 3rd] According to reports from South Korea and the United States on the 3rd, a war has broken out between the South Korean Army and the South Korean Military Police Battalion stationed in Taegu City (transliteration), 16 miles southeast of Seoul. Official statements said that this war was only a small conflict between the two units due to a quarrel. However, Seoul newspapers issued extra editions, believing that this incident was very serious. It is rumored that there was also a dispute in Naju City (transliteration) between Seoul and Yeosu, but details are not yet known. US military circles said that the Taegu district war began at 1:00 p.m. on the 2nd, because a sergeant refused to be arrested because the charges were not determined, and shot at the military police with a gun. After that, 30 military police immediately gathered, and a full-scale war broke out. By dusk on the 2nd, the situation had calmed down.

### Soviet Union Expected to Change Strategy in Far East Commission

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] US diplomats believed on the 2nd that due to the Communist Party's capture of the Northeast, the strategy of Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin in the Far East Commission meetings is now clear. The official said that Pan apparently knew the timetable for the Communist Party's progress in the Northeast, so Pan's work has always been to try his best to obstruct any measures in the Far East Commission that might revive Japan and reduce the US economic burden on Japan. The official continued that Pan Youxin's job was obviously to make Japan's economic situation virtually worthless to Western countries in the event of war in the Far East.

### Miners in Northern France Clash with Military Police

### Four Major Companies Resume Business Yesterday, Prices of All Goods Increase Twofold, Hotel Prices Increase Twofold, Cotton Cloth Follows Approved Wholesale Price Plus 30%, New Prices for Public Utilities to Be Announced This Weekend

[Our Report] With the approval of the Social Affairs Bureau, the prices of all goods in the four major companies, including Wing On and Sincere on Nanjing Road, have been adjusted to increase by 200%, and business resumed yesterday afternoon. Also, the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday approved the hotel industry to increase prices by 200% from today, and the cotton cloth industry to increase prices by 30% based on the government-approved wholesale price, including operating expenses, taxes, and profits. As for the items that should be negotiated in price, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the respective trade associations to conduct preliminary reviews and report for approval. The Social Affairs Bureau needs to wait for the central government to announce the price of rationed rice per capita in November before making a decision on the price of budget meals.

[Our Report] Yesterday, the reporter asked Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, about the adjustment multiple of public utility prices. According to him, the cost prices of public utilities are being calculated separately by the respective companies, and the borrowing number of the increase cannot be predicted at present. Because the price of rationed coal and the new salaries and wages of employees are all undetermined, it is impossible to estimate. However, today's public utility prices are frozen according to the 819 limited price, and its costs are based on the July prices as the base, which is very far from the current prices. Therefore, it is generally estimated that the increase multiple of public utility prices may be quite alarming. The current price negotiations in various industries are regarded as assumptions, and adjustments will be made after the new prices for public utilities are announced. According to Director Zhao, the new prices for public utilities are expected to be announced this weekend.

### Sincere Businesses Must Not Raise Prices, Cotton Cloth Given Priority to Retail

[Our Report] The supplementary measures stipulate that yarn and cloth are priced by the central competent authority and regulated in a coordinated manner, but black market situations have been found in this city where various industries have raised prices for sale. The Social Affairs Bureau will strictly crack down on this. The bureau has recently ordered the three trade associations of the cotton textile industry, the machine dyeing and weaving industry, and the cotton cloth business to comply with two points: (1) They should be sold in accordance with the approved price and must not exceed it. If there is any intentional violation, it will be severely dealt with in accordance with the regulations on violating limited prices and negotiated prices. (2) Retail cloth stores have depleted their inventory due to the rush buying spree. In the future, retail merchants should be given priority in the distribution of goods to meet market sales, and wholesale merchants should be temporarily suspended from distribution. The remaining quota should be distributed to retail merchants together. Once the market returns to normal, wholesale will be reopened.

### Rice Industry Resolves Two Points, Expressed Its Wishes to the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday

[Our Report] The Rice Business Association held a general meeting of all members yesterday afternoon and resolved two points: (1) Rice shops are running out of funds. An electric administrative agency is requested to provide relief and organize interest-free loans. (2) The handling fee for rice shops to handle the per capita distribution of rice is 5%, which cannot be maintained. The Civil Food Allocation Committee is requested to increase it. After the meeting, representatives such as Wan Molin and Qu Zhenhua were dispatched to petition the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Rice and Oil Decide on Two Points, Petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday

[Our Report] Retailers of rice, oil, sundries, and cotton cloth have been petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau for days, stating that the inventories of their respective industries have been depleted after the rush buying spree, while wholesalers have suffered no losses. They requested that wholesalers share the losses and provide relief to retailers. According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, there is no legal basis for this matter, and the government's handling method has not yet been determined. He will first persuade retailers and wholesalers in various industries to negotiate their own solutions.

### Sundries Stores Cannot Open, Supply of Goods Is a Problem, Prices Are Even More Impossible to Discuss

The nature of the sundries industry in this city is that of retailers, and all goods are supplied by the seafood, northern goods, and longan wholesale industries. In order to calculate costs, the Sundries Industry Association invited the Seafood, Northern Goods, and Longan Wholesale Industry Associations to hold a joint meeting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss prices. In the past, the members of the Sundries Industry Association followed the price limit policy and queued up for residents to rush to buy them every day, resulting in the depletion of nine out of ten of their inventories. Since the implementation of the price limit, the seafood, northern goods, and longan industries have failed to fully supply goods. They are currently in urgent need of price negotiations in order to open for business. However, by about 11:00 a.m., only the representatives of the seafood industry provided price indications. The other representatives of the northern goods industry attended the meeting but did not express anything, and no representatives from the longan industry attended. As a result, price negotiations could not proceed, and all sundries stores in the city were still unable to open for business due to the unresolved issue of goods supply.

### Ship Passenger Ticket Prices Temporarily Increase Meal Fees, Train Passenger Fares to Increase Fivefold

[Our Report] The shipping industry has felt that the current passenger and freight rates are no longer sustainable and has repeatedly submitted adjustments to the Ministry of Communications, but there has been no reasonable solution to date. According to the Shipping Association yesterday, representatives were recently sent to Beijing again to request adjustments from the Ministry of Communications. As a result, only a twofold increase was allowed. However, the price of oil and coal fuel is about to rise, and the cost of living index will also be restored. The shipping industry is heavily burdened and still feels unable to sustain it. Therefore, it is difficult to implement the 100% approved by the Ministry of Communications. It can only wait for the oil and coal prices to be adjusted before reporting to the Ministry for reasonable adjustments. Also, the Shipping Association announced on the 2nd that from the 2nd of this month, the freight for registered goods will be charged at the current freight rate for the time being, but after the adjustment, the new price must be paid retroactively. As for passenger ticket prices, from the 2nd, a meal fee of 50% will be temporarily added. It is reported that train passenger fares will also increase fivefold, and the postage for regular letters will increase from 5 cents to 10 cents.

### Cotton Cloth for Rice Issue, Management Office Reviews Disaster Relief Register, Director Wu Denies Inquiry

[Our Report] The whereabouts of the 20,000 bolts of cloth allocated by the Management Office to rice merchants has become the subject of social attention. According to a report in a local newspaper in this city yesterday, Director Wu Kaixian said that the 20,000 bolts of cloth had been handed over to the Rice Industry Association, and the rice had been exchanged and sold in Shanghai. The reporter specifically inquired about this matter from a person in charge of the Management Office, who said: The rice merchants supplied rice first in the matter of exchanging cloth for rice, starting after receiving the order on the 10th of last month. It is also a fact that the purchase price of rice merchants when purchasing from the producing area was higher than the limited price. The allocation of cotton cloth to rice merchants was on the eve of the lifting of the price limit. As for the transaction situation, Wan Molin has been ordered to provide detailed receipts and account books for review. The Management Office will strictly investigate and verify with a consistent responsible attitude. If any malfeasance is found, it will be given the most severe punishment.

[Another Report] According to yesterday's report, the Supervision and Guidance Office of the Management Office summoned Wan Molin, chairman of the Rice Industry Association, etc., to inquire about the whereabouts of the 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth allocated for rice exchange, and there was a saying that they were ordered to return them all. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau said yesterday: "There is no such thing. I have inquired with Supervisor Jiang, and Supervisor Jiang also said that there is no such fact." Director Wu also said: "The matter of exchanging cloth for rice was approved by Supervisor Jiang, and it has been ordered since October 10 that rice can be exchanged for cloth. The Rice Industry Association has been instructed to comply with the implementation. It has been many days now, and there should be no more changes. Rice merchants can go to the Rice Industry Association to collect cloth in accordance with the original method. This Bureau has also notified the Association to report in detail the amount of rice transported and the number of rice shops distributed and the amount of cloth exchanged since that day, so that it can be forwarded."

### Crowds Gather in Front of the US Consulate in Shanghai to Watch the Unveiling of the US Presidential Election

[Our Report] Crowds gathered in front of the US Consulate at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road yesterday to watch the results of the US presidential election. The unveiling table for the election was made by the US News Service and the election results were shown on the table at any time. The rise and fall of the ratio of Truman's and Dewey's votes was clear at a glance, no less than a huge barometer. (The picture was taken by the US News Service)

### Extreme Tightening of Money Supply: Secret Interest Rates Reach 60%
Yesterday (the 3rd), the tightness of the money supply in the three cities intensified, becoming increasingly severe. Due to the flourishing business in various markets, speculation on rising prices, and a surge in demand for funds, the supply of funds yesterday was slightly higher. However, interest rates continued to climb, reaching over 60% in some cases, with the general rate exceeding 54%. The availability of cash was also quite limited, and banks continued to restrict withdrawals.

Merchants Unwilling to Sell Lightly, Tea Market Transactions Scarce
Yesterday, tea merchants remained firm in their intention to sell, quoting prices at a high point, resulting in a lack of transactions. According to a prominent figure in the tea industry, there is currently significant international interest in Chinese tea. However, since the authorities permitted the relaxation of price controls and implemented negotiated pricing based on costs, prices of all goods have risen sharply. The future cost of producing tea for export, including labor and all related supplies, will increase by 150%, while overseas tea prices remain stable. Considering this situation, exports may face difficulties in the short term.

Last Week's Export Exchange Settlement Only Worth Over 2.9 Million US Dollars
From October 24th to 31st, the amount of foreign exchange settlement applied for by Shanghai for exported goods decreased compared to the previous week. The total figure converted to US dollars was $2,986,643.17, including $1,842,252.60 for government-managed foreign exchange settlements (i.e., textiles, minerals, sugar, etc.).

Continued Joint Procurement of Domestic Cotton: Participation by Mills Not Mandatory, Cotton Purchase Prices Based on Local Negotiations
Yesterday afternoon, the National Cotton Joint Procurement Office discussed the policy for purchasing domestic cotton after the lifting of price controls. The following resolutions were reached: (1) Comprehensive joint procurement will continue. However, participation in joint procurement by individual mills is not mandatory. Those unwilling to participate are allowed to purchase cotton freely, but those who wish to participate must adhere to the joint procurement regulations and refrain from independent cotton purchases. (2) Cotton purchase prices in all regions will be based on local negotiations. Mills not participating in joint procurement must also adhere to local negotiated prices and avoid creating internal disorder. (3) In areas without negotiated prices for cotton, purchases will be made at market prices. Furthermore, according to inquiries made by reporters to a responsible person at the association, cotton merchants are not prohibited from purchasing raw cotton. However, those purchasing in joint procurement areas must comply with local negotiated prices. As for raw cotton purchased by merchants in communist-controlled areas or in areas without negotiated prices, the joint council will purchase it at market prices. Those unwilling to sell to the joint procurement council are permitted to sell freely to mills not participating in the joint procurement effort.

[Further Report] The Sixth District Textile Association also resolved yesterday on the question of whether all member mills of the National Cotton Joint Procurement would participate in the joint procurement business. The details are as follows: (1) All mills willing to participate in the joint procurement business must apply by the 5th of this month; late applications will be considered as voluntary abandonment. (2) Member factories willing to participate will still be allocated based on the amount of capital paid in after receiving cotton. (3) The handling of the capital already paid by factories unwilling to participate will be discussed and decided later.

[Further Report] Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company resumed the distribution of yarns at new prices for the first time (provisionally for the silk weaving industry). A total of four types were offered, with 279 pieces sold. 20-count Tianguan large package priced at 1780 yuan, 14-count Shuiyue at 1490 yuan, 15-count Fengnian at 1540 yuan, and 40-count Riguang at 2715 yuan, taxes to be paid separately.

[Further Report] The Yarn Merchants' Association's application to the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to reopen the market and for approval of legitimate profits has not yet been approved. Yesterday, notices were posted at both the front and back entrances of the market stating that members are prohibited from engaging in illegal transactions before the market reopens.

[This Newspaper Report] Zhao Lanting, Ma Wenyuan, and other principals of middle schools evacuated from Yantai to Shanghai, received reporters at the Shandong Fellow-Villagers Association at 2:00 PM yesterday. Li Ximou, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, Gao Guoliang, of the Youth Counseling Committee, and Zhang Qinxu, of the Shandong Provincial Department of Education, also attended. The principals of the middle schools expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the care and enthusiastic assistance provided by all sectors of Shanghai for the evacuation of Yantai students to Shanghai.

Relocation to Jiangwan
The refugee students have now been relocated to the transit troops reception center in Jiangwan. The Ministry of Education has remitted 30,000 yuan to maintain their meals, and counselors from various middle schools in the city are taking turns to be responsible for guidance. The Comforting Association is planning to perform movies and Chinese opera there and open the library and reading room to provide spiritual comfort. Fang Zhi and Li Ximou are scheduled to give speeches there at 3:00 PM this afternoon.

Educational Issues
Regarding the students' educational issues, it has been decided to establish the Shandong Provincial Yantai Temporary Middle School.

Northeast Wind's Fourth Battle: Today Meeting Zichao
Still at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM This Afternoon
The Northeast Wind football team's fourth match in Shanghai will be against the mixed Chinese-Western Zichao team at Yiyuan on Shaanxi South Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon. In the guest team's past three matches, they have met Railway, Qingbai, and China Aviation, resulting in a draw in each case, which can be described as a coincidence. The team's instructor, Jiang Lu, once said, "If you think Northeast Wind is not bad, they have never won; if you think they are not good, they have never lost," which is a fair assessment. The team is energetic and determined, and the players are tall and strong. Today, they are facing a strong enemy and will definitely fight with all their strength. Zichao has emerged as a dark horse this year, with a combination of Chinese and Western stars. Captain Wu Qixiang has also added foreign players such as "Yellow Hair" Robert Stoffs, "Pockmarked Face" Nogolov, and Grinas Schilz, promising a fierce battle with the guest team.

Violin Virtuoso Ma Sicong in Hangzhou
Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[This Newspaper Hangzhou 3rd Dispatch] Brother Sicong and his wife came to Hangzhou for sightseeing in 1936, without giving a performance. It has been twelve years. The long-separated lakes and mountains, the long-separated friendship, must be exceptionally cordial and exciting. Especially after more than ten performances in Shanghai, they can take a break on the refreshing shores of West Lake. However, in order to stimulate the musical atmosphere of Hangzhou and provide music lovers in Hangzhou with the opportunity to listen, I again requested a few performances in Hangzhou during our intimate conversation, and they finally agreed.

Chatting about Hangzhou and Beiping
He loves the lakes and mountains of Hangzhou very much. He said that it is good to be close to nature and necessary to be close to the people. He also agreed that such a beautiful mountain lake as Hangzhou should become a cultural city. Brother Sicong thought she was too gentle, but after seeing the Liuhe Pagoda, he changed his tone. However, he still felt that the architectural style of Hangzhou was inferior to that of Beiping, because Beiping appeared very grand and majestic. I said that Beiping's status as a cultural city was largely inherited from feudalism. I said that we must build a truly people-owned cultural city. So we talked about Chinese culture. Before the Tang Dynasty, almost all of China's art and culture were popularized among the people. After the Tang Dynasty, especially after the Song Dynasty, culture was owned by the emperors, and the people could not enjoy the happiness bestowed by culture. Therefore, we have regressed step by step since the Tang Dynasty, while European and American countries have made significant progress.

Attending Literary and Art Evening Party
On October 25th, Brother Sicong and his wife attended the welcoming literary and art evening party we hosted. This was the fifth literary and art evening party we have held. Brother Sicong did not speak, but used the sound of his violin to replace his words. When he played the strings, each sound closely touched the heartstrings of the audience, moving their emotions and then leading them into a leisurely and yearning realm. When he finished playing, the audience returned to normal and, recalling the already longed-for artistic conception, could not help but cheer and ask for "one more!"

Warm Tea Party Reception
The 26th was a warm tea party hosted by the old painter Mr. Lin Fengmian. Mr. Lin invited many artists and painters. Thanks to Mr. Lin's relative, Mr. Kama, who repeatedly played records of famous musicians from his collection, giving us endless expectations in the face of our Chinese violinist today. The 27th was a concert at the Air Force School, "Tibetan Tone Poem," the voice of the motherland told the air warriors of the motherland that they should love this vast homeland. The 28th was a welcome concert at the Art College. At this gathering, Principal Zhu Kezhen talked about using music to influence the atmosphere of war.

His Own Concerts
The 29th, 30th, and 31st were the three days of his own concerts, held at the Art College on the Outer West Lake. It was necessary to pass through Bai Causeway to get there. If you traveled from the Lower City to the Art College, it was a three-kilometer journey, but thousands of music lovers went there madly to listen to the music. The quiet Bai Causeway on that late autumn night suddenly became lively.

It really stirred up the barren music scene in Hangzhou, and various schools and organizations requested performances one after another. November 1st to Zhejiang University, 2nd to Zhejiang University, and 3rd to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau. In total, Brother Sicong won the support of over 10,000 listeners in Hangzhou this time.

Brother Sicong is not only a performer but also a composer. He told me that his "Spring Cantata" will be published soon. I wish him continued efforts forever, because music is the song of nature, is poetry, is the truest sound, and is the ode of the people.

Principal Offender Wang Qinglan Indicted in the Case of the Shooting of Henan Refugee Students in Beijing
[This Newspaper Nanjing 3rd Dispatch] In the case of Wang Qinglan, the owner of a grocery store on Jiankang Road in Beijing, shooting and killing Henan refugee students, the principal offender Wang Qinglan has been indicted by the District Prosecutor's Office on charges of murder and endangering public safety. The prosecuting prosecutor requested the criminal court to apply Article 23 of the Criminal Law because Wang's behavior was quite close to the meaning of self-defense, hence the prosecutor's discussion of it.

Negotiated Rice Prices in Various Places
[This Newspaper Kunshan 3rd Dispatch] Since the announcement of the supplementary measures for economic reform, the authorities have decided to allow free buying and selling of rice.

Far East Showcase: New Display
Xie Mingxin

[Hong Kong 1st Air Dispatch] If we compare Europe during World War II to China today, which is in the midst of a civil war, then the position and situation of Hong Kong are just like Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, where international spies were plotting against each other at that time.

This showcase of the British Empire in the Far East has now become a base for smuggling and a haven for political prisoners.

Xu Jizhuang, the former director of the Postal Remittance Bureau, who was arrested on suspicion of corruption, has not yet been extradited to the Chinese government. The reason is that Xu's confession has shifted its focus to "opposing the government." This excuse for dodging inquiries from the Hong Kong court is nothing more than using the name of "political prisoner" to allow Britain, which claims to be a democratic polity, to protect him and not hand him over to the Chinese government to avoid death.

Recently, it has been widely rumored here that Cai Tingkai, Zhang Bojun, and others have gone to the Red Capital of Harbin to participate in the "New Political Consultative Conference" hosted by the CCP. The next day, the left-wing newspaper Huashang Bao made no mention of this, and the Xinhua News Agency also had no reports. General Li Jishen, Cai's old superior, refused to meet with newspaper reporters, acting as if nothing had happened. In fact, Zhang Bojun, Cai Tingkai, and others had long ago secretly gone to Macau to obtain birth certificates, used their Portuguese status to have the Soviet consulate sign them, and boarded Soviet-controlled merchant ships to go to North Korea first and then to the Northeast border, and have now arrived in Harbin. It is said that this meeting is not a formal "New Political Consultative Conference," but rather a "New Political Consultative Preparatory Meeting."

Left-wing intellectuals staying in Hong Kong, except for Mao Dun, Xia Yan, and others who can arrange their lives by writing, generally cannot solve the two major problems of career and livelihood, because although Hong Kong claims to be a small political center and a cultural fortress, the real power in Hong Kong is in the hands of the British, and Hong Kong's economic power is only in the industrial and commercial sectors. The capacity for accommodating and digesting cultural figures is extremely limited. The best-selling newspaper in Hong Kong is Cheng Bao, a typical yellow tabloid that is best suited to the tastes of Hong Kong's petty bourgeoisie and is the most suitable reading material for leisure after tea and wine. Secondly, there is the long-established Overseas Chinese Daily, which is similar to the Shen and Xin newspapers in Shanghai in its position in Hong Kong, targeting businessmen, with many advertisements, many pages, and the most issues. The Dagong Bao, sponsored by the Department of Political Science, the recently relocated and republished Wenhui Bao, and the Sing Tao Daily of the Hu Wenhu Foundation have relatively close numbers in terms of sales.

The real focus of Hong Kong is definitely not politics and culture, but its commercial position. Its impact on China's international trade and its connection with China's financial market are very close and have a very large relationship. Hong Kong's financial black market can disrupt the entire Chinese financial market. Despite your official prohibition of foreign exchange arbitrage between black market Hong Kong dollars and gold yuan coupons, there are still many people operating in reality. Since October, Shenhui transactions have become rampant again. This is certainly related to the Battle of Jinan and the Shanghai buying spree. The Shanghai authorities' failure to open up imports, which led to a situation of ample inventory but no goods on the market, was also a miscalculation.

Although Hong Kong claims to be a "free trade port," this oriental commercial port is heavily bound by some British laws and regulations. For example, you must declare the import of gold and foreign currency in advance, otherwise it will be confiscated. Many overseas Chinese have suffered a great loss because they do not understand this rigid rule. Also, goods must be applied for foreign exchange settlement for export, which also causes a lot of trouble for legitimate merchants. A permit must also be applied for the import of goods. In addition, the harsh and detailed clauses and precedents are so numerous that even old Hong Kong people and even judges are confused. This is Hong Kong's "rule of law."

Hong Kong currently has close to one million people, and the housing shortage and food supply depend on Guangzhou and other places. The cost of living can be said to be the highest in the world, but the residents of Hong Kong are very good at finding fun and entertaining themselves. Even if they are not full at three meals a day, women must have beautiful cheongsams and American cosmetics, and men must wear well-tailored suits and enjoy movies or Cantonese opera. Everything must be maintained on the surface and is very hypocritical. Hong Kong people can be said to be the people who like face the most.

Moral cases, rape cases, suicide cases, smuggling cases, and fraud cases have become the daily routine of the local courts, which symbolizes the abnormal prosperity of Hong Kong society and its inevitable decline.

Social Services: Please Note for Readers
In recent reader consultation letters, we have discovered two phenomena:

(1) Some readers are unwilling to write their real names and addresses in their letters, and often use "A Reader," "A Citizen," or other pseudonyms. This has caused a lot of obstacles to our service work.

(2) Some "opinions" and "appeals" letters do not have the signature and seal of a definite person in charge, or even have no specific facts. We really cannot handle these letters.

In the future, we hope that readers who write letters to inquire will be able to tell us their real names and detailed addresses so that we can reduce the trouble of dealing with "headless cases." At the same time, it can also prevent the hard-working green-clad messengers from running extra wrong roads due to "misplaced letters" stating "there is no such person at this address." We are wholeheartedly serving our readers and hope that readers will assist us more in this regard.

### Meeting of the General Labor Union's Executive and Supervisory Committee Discussing Important Wage and Livelihood Issues; Before the Publication of This Month's Index, Wages Will Temporarily Be Increased by Three Times the Original Salary; Requesting the Government to Abolish Basic Salary Discounts

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Municipal General Labor Union convened an emergency meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members to discuss important issues such as wages after the lifting of economic controls.  Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangyun, Ye Xianggao, Fang Rusheng, Liang Yongzhang, and many other executive and supervisory committee members and heads of various industry unions attended.  Chairman Shui Xiangyun passed the following resolutions: (1) Regarding wage issues: A, a request will be submitted to the government to abolish all existing discounts on basic wages; B, wages should be issued uniformly based on the Fuqi index; C, wages should be issued within five days after the index is published. (2) Regarding the issue of daily necessities rations for workers: A, if the worker's rationed goods are used to calculate the index based on rationed prices, the government should be requested to provide them on schedule; otherwise, the difference in price should be compensated at market prices; B, the quality of rationed goods should not be lower than the quality of items stipulated in the cost-of-living index. (3) Regarding the October rice purchase certificates for workers, any unions that have submitted certificates but have not yet received rice should vigorously argue with the Civil Affairs Commission, and Chairman Shui and the executive directors should be authorized to request the Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Affairs Commission to approve and issue the rice at 10:00 AM tomorrow. (4) In October, black market prices soared. Apart from public utilities, cotton spinning, cigarette, and silk weaving unions, where factories have already advanced one month's salary, other industrial and professional workers who have not received advances should be informed to request advances from their employers as an example, to supplement the insufficient living expenses of workers in October. (5) For fluid workers without a fixed employer (such as plasterers, carpenters, plumbers, etc.), whose wages are settled on a temporary basis, the government is requested to approve the temporary calculation of wages at three times the original salary before the November cost-of-living index is published. (6) All unions that have not reported their representatives should submit their reports to the union before October 15; failure to report by the deadline will be considered a waiver. (7) Preparations for the sixth session of the representative assembly for re-election have been completed and it has been decided to hold it at the Four Sisters Restaurant at 9:00 AM on November 21.

### At the Most Severe Coal Shortage, the Power Company's Reserves Are Only Enough for Six Days; The Public Utilities Bureau Requests Expedited Allocation

[Report from this newspaper] The coal shortage in this city has reached its most severe stage. According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, the Shanghai Electric Power Company's coal reserves are only sufficient to supply until the 9th of this month. If no coal is received within the next five days, the company will be forced to reduce power generation from the 10th, and will try its best to replace it with fuel oil. For this reason, the Public Utilities Bureau has repeatedly consulted with the Fuel Management Committee, requesting that coal be allocated before the 9th to alleviate the urgent need. It is now known that the Lingyun ship was sailing to Taiwan to load coal but unfortunately ran aground. It has now been rescued and is expected to arrive in Shanghai within a few days. The ship is carrying 7,500 tons of coal, and if there is no loss, it can temporarily alleviate the emergency.

According to Director Zhao: The coal shortage should be a major problem for this city this winter. Coal-producing areas have abundant coal reserves. Currently, Kailuan has 700,000 tons of coal, and Huainan has 140,000 tons, but they are suffering from a lack of transportation. According to statistics, the monthly coal demand of various public utilities in this city is 46,900 tons. If the coal supply is cut off, it will be a major threat to people's livelihoods. Therefore, the authorities are now planning to suggest to the central government to allocate troops to protect coal transportation and speed up the transportation of coal stored in Huainan to Shanghai. It is also known that 70,000 tons of foreign coal ordered by the China Trust Bureau from abroad is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month or early next month.

### Very Few Goods Arriving from Traders, Rice Market Is Strong; Flour Is Not Open for Business, Edible Oil Cannot Meet Demand

Very little rice is arriving, with a total of 1,046 shi arriving in the North and South markets yesterday, mostly from rice shops doing their own business. Very few goods are arriving from traders, so the market has no goods to supply. The market is very strong, and no spot prices have been quoted. It is reported that ten-day delivery of road cargo japonica rice is being quoted at 95 yuan, and the market is rising.

Flour

Formal negotiated prices have not been set, and factories have not yet supplied the market, so there is no trading. It is reported that miscellaneous brand flour is being quoted at 40 yuan. Bran is in urgent demand in the countryside, and the price has risen again. Large bags of bran are up to 6 yuan.

Grains

Trading is becoming more prosperous every day. Few soybeans are arriving, and there is a shortage. Hankou Zhadou is 60 yuan, Poyang soybeans are 65 yuan, up 10 yuan. Corn from the North is being imported instead of exported, and the price has decreased by 3 yuan. Red sorghum is down 4 to 5 yuan. Buckwheat and cowpeas are both weak. Sesame trading has become more active, and peanut prices are similar.

Edible Oil

Supply cannot meet demand. Cooked vegetable oil is up 5 to 10 yuan, but it is still not enough to distribute. The manufacturers jointly opened sales, with about 3,000 dan of soybean oil and rapeseed oil, all priced at 190 yuan. Jiangbei net raw oil has also been quoted, priced at 238 yuan. The Zhongzhi Factory did not lead the opening of sales, resulting in insufficient oil supply. Sesame oil has not been quoted. Soybean cake is scarce, with Yu Ji cake at 25 yuan, up 2.5 yuan.

### Rice Shop Suspected of Raising Prices, Manager Detained

[Report from this newspaper] More than 1,000 shi of goods arrived in the North and South rice markets yesterday, but no formal trading took place. During trading hours in the South market, Ding Yichang Rice Shop at No. 102 Shanxi Road sold 70 shi of Jiangxi indica rice at a price of 110 yuan, which was purchased by Yuanchang at No. 6 Daxing Street (20 shi) and Xiangmao at No. 5 Zhi'an Lane, Luxiangyuan Road (50 shi). Social Affairs Bureau personnel stationed at the market suspected that it was raising prices and, after reporting to the bureau for instructions, detained Ding Xianglin, the manager of Ding Yichang Rice Shop, and transferred him to the police station. Later, he was released on bail by Yuanda Shop and ordered to be available for questioning at any time.

According to Wu, director of the Social Affairs Bureau: According to the rules of the rice market, rice shops purchase from the market and resell to citizens. However, Ding Yichang Rice Shop sold in the market and quoted a price of 110 yuan, which was a sudden increase of 20 yuan compared to the previous day, which obviously suspected of deliberately raising prices. Although food has been approved for free trade, manipulative behavior will still be prohibited. The disposal of the case will be reported to Mayor Wu for approval.
