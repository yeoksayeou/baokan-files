### Foreign Minister Wang Shijie Issues Statement: China's Policy Towards Japan is Consistent, Ensuring the Prevention of the Revival of Militarism is Guaranteed. The General Populace Holds No Anti-American Sentiment

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement on the 5th regarding Japan's industrial level and related reparations issues:

(1) Allied Basic Policy on Japan's Industrial Level and Reparations: The basic policy of the Allied Powers regarding Japan's industrial level and reparations was established by the Potsdam Declaration of July 25, 1945. Article 11 of that declaration states:

"Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war. To this end, raw materials shall be allowed entry into Japan, but control over raw materials shall be eliminated. Japan shall be permitted eventually to participate in world trade relations." This declaration was jointly decided by the leaders of the governments of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and later agreed to by the leader of the Soviet government. It was announced to the Japanese people before Japan's surrender and constitutes a mutual constraint among the Allied powers.

(2) US Report: After Japan's surrender, the US government sent an investigation team led by Pauley to Japan and various parts of the Far East in 1946. Based on the report submitted by Pauley, commonly referred to as the Pauley Report, all Japanese military factories and most ordinary factories that could be converted for military use should be dismantled and removed. In 1947 and 1948, the US government sent investigation teams led by Strike and Draper to Japan, respectively. The reports are commonly referred to as the Strike Report and the Draper (or Johnston) Report. Both of these reports advocated that Japan should retain more factories than suggested in the Pauley Report.

(3) Current Discussions by the Far Eastern Commission: After the Pauley Report was submitted, the US government submitted a plan for the dismantling of Japanese factories to the Far Eastern Commission in April 1947. The current discussions in the commission are actually based on the investigation of the Pauley Report. The countries attending the Far Eastern Commission have not yet reached an agreement on the scope of Japanese industrial retention. If a decision is made, according to the organizational regulations of the Far Eastern Commission, the unanimous agreement of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union is required. Before the four countries reach a final agreement, the US government has agreed to a preliminary dismantling plan so that the four countries that have suffered the most deeply, namely China, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, can receive partial reparations first. China should receive half of the factories dismantled under this preliminary plan. As for the US government's attitude towards the Strike Report and the Draper (or Johnston) Report, we have not yet received any official indication from the US government.

(4) China's Policy: Regarding this issue, China's policy has been clearly stated repeatedly and has been consistent throughout. We support and endorse the principles of the Potsdam Declaration. We must have a definite guarantee against the revival of Japanese militarism. At the same time, we recognize that Japan must gradually become self-sufficient in terms of ordinary economic life. In his inaugural address on May 20 of this year, President Chiang stated that China does not adopt a policy of revenge towards Japan. The Japanese people should be able to rebuild their economy within the scope set by the Allied powers to secure their livelihood. In his foreign affairs report to the National Assembly on April 14 of this year, he also stated, "The future peace treaty with Japan must guarantee that Japan cannot commit aggression again. In the economic aspect, we do not oppose making the Japanese people self-sufficient. Our goal is to foster the birth of a new and democratic Japan, neither allowing it to embark on the path of a revived militarism nor allowing it to embark on the path of communism."

Preventing Japan from re-invading and giving the Japanese people a chance to be self-sufficient—how to reconcile these two demands is indeed a task that requires careful consideration and may cause disputes among the governments concerned. The Chinese government and the US government often have different opinions on whether certain Japanese factories should be dismantled. However, I firmly believe that neither the Chinese government nor the US government has any intention of allowing Japan to re-arm. Such connivance is unimaginable for a government that resisted Japanese aggression for as long as thirteen years, and it is also unimaginable for the US government, which has the painful experience of Pearl Harbor.

I also firmly believe that even if some people in the country have concerns or misunderstandings about this matter, the general Chinese populace holds no anti-American sentiment, because this country was our like-minded friend in the last World War, and in the future, we must also cooperate with each other to establish world peace.

### Finance Minister Wang Yunwu Assumes Office: Future Policies Will Still Focus on Increasing Revenue and Reducing Expenditure, Planning New Taxes and Rectifying Tax Collection

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The new Finance Minister, Wang Yunwu, arrived at the ministry at 9:00 AM on the 5th to assume office. Former Minister Yu Hongjun introduced him and addressed the ministry's staff. Yu first praised Wang for succeeding him as Finance Minister, saying that Wang is fair and honest, and puts the country first in his work, and he believed that he would definitely take effective measures to save the economic crisis in the future. He then encouraged all colleagues to cooperate effectively with Minister Wang. Wang then stood up amid applause and said that at the most difficult time for the country, he was taking on the most difficult task. Many outsiders thought that he was ignorant of the facts or overestimated his abilities, but he did not think so. He had spent several days gaining a clear understanding of the total expenditure and the maximum possible total revenue for the second half of this year. As for whether he "overestimated his abilities," he also had self-knowledge. For a year, he had participated in the National Economic Council and the Budget Review Committee, and had gained an understanding of the financial and economic situation. At this difficult time for the country's finances and economy, he would do his best to improve the situation based on his understanding. He hoped that his colleagues would cooperate with him and work together to complete the mission. Finally, he explained his policy direction, saying that at this time of national financial difficulties, with huge military and public expenditures, the Ministry of Finance's policy would still focus on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Expenditure reduction should start from the Ministry of Finance itself, while revenue increase is the Ministry of Finance's undeniable responsibility. This should start with opening up new tax sources and rectifying tax collection. The first step in opening up new tax sources is to increase new taxes. Although this cannot be effective in the short term, new taxes that the people think should be implemented, and that comply with the principle of those with money paying money, must be implemented. In terms of rectifying tax collection, the tax rate should be adapted to prices. In the future, supervision will also be strengthened to ensure that every penny of tax revenue collected by tax collection agencies is turned over to the public treasury. Wang talked about future financial and foreign exchange policies, saying that the financial control policy is generally good, and will continue to be implemented effectively in the future. Foreign exchange policy has improved since Mr. Yu became the Governor of the Central Bank. In the future, he hopes that the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank will cooperate and jointly be responsible for striving for the perfection of the foreign exchange policy. Finally, Wang also encouraged all his colleagues to do more and talk less, and to work hard to ensure that the financial and economic situation is substantially improved in order to overcome the current economic crisis.

[Further Dispatch] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu went to the ministry to work both in the morning and afternoon of the 5th, and met individually with Vice Ministers of Finance Xu Baiyuan and Li Dang and senior ministry officials to inquire about the ministry's work situation. He also announced the appointment of Xu Baiqi as Chief Secretary, Wu Zhuangjun as Director of the General Affairs Department, and Zhao Guan as Senior Secretary. Most other personnel changes were not made. Yang Mianzhong, Director of the National Treasury Department, and Zai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department, requested to resign, which was approved by Yu Hongjun. Candidates for their successors are still being sought. It is rumored that Chen Pingcheng has been internally appointed as Director of the Currency Issuance Department. Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, had requested to resign earlier, and Wang Yunwu is currently trying to persuade him to stay. It is also learned that Yu Hongjun returned to Shanghai by night train on the 5th.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, previously concurrently held by Yu Hongjun, has now been taken over by Wang Yunwu after Yu was transferred to be the Governor of the Central Bank. Liang Jingchun, who also served as Chief Secretary of the Bureau, had requested to resign, but Wang Yunwu persuaded him to stay. However, Liang's position as Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance has been resigned and approved, and he has been transferred to be a Counselor of the Ministry of Finance.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Thai government has closed our overseas Chinese schools. Our authorities have lodged protests through diplomatic channels, but no satisfactory results have been achieved. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission specially invited eight units from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant agencies to discuss countermeasures at the commission on the afternoon of the 5th. As a result, it was considered that diplomatic channels should still be used to actively negotiate, urging the Thai government to fulfill the provisions of the treaty and abolish the new regulations restricting overseas Chinese schools in order to maintain the traditional friendship between China and Thailand.

[United Press, Bangkok, 5th] The Thai Ministry of Education today proposed a compromise solution to the closure of 500 overseas Chinese schools in the country, advocating that the closed schools should first comply with the law and reopen, and then request to amend the law.

### Constitutional Control Yuan Officially Convenes, President Chiang Personally Delivers Speech, Tomorrow's First Preparatory Meeting Will Elect the President

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The first Constitutional Control Yuan officially convened. The opening ceremony was solemnly held in the auditorium of the Lizhi Society at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 5th. 115 members of the Control Yuan attended. President Chiang, wearing a blue robe and a black mandarin jacket, accompanied by Liu Zhe, arrived. Vice President Li and government leaders Weng Wenhao, Zhou Zhongyue, He Yingqin, Wang Shijie, Guan Jiyu, Gui Yongqing, etc., and foreign guests from France, the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, and India, attended the ceremony. The opening ceremony was presided over by Li Mengbiao, a 70-year-old member of the Control Yuan from Shaanxi, who delivered a speech, explaining that the Control Yuan has a heavy responsibility after the implementation of the Constitution. The members of this session of the Control Yuan should faithfully exercise their powers under the Constitution, display a fair demeanor, and vigorously implement impeachment and censure. Then President Chiang was invited to deliver a speech, starting at 10:12 AM, encouraging this session of the Control Yuan to continue the unfinished work of the past and complete the mission of constitutional governance. It lasted for five minutes and then music was played to complete the ceremony.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The first Control Yuan produced under the Constitution convened on the 5th. The Control Yuan Organization Law, which was promulgated on March 31 last year and amended on December 25 of the same year and April 3 of the 37th year of the Republic of China, was also issued by the President on the 5th, and implemented from the 5th.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] After the opening of the Constitutional Control Yuan, all members of the Control Yuan are scheduled to pay respects to the Mausoleum at 9:00 AM on the 6th. The first preparatory meeting is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 7th. The meeting will first elect the temporary chairman and temporary secretary-general. After the preparatory committee reports on the preparations, the following proposals will be discussed: (1) The seating arrangement of the Control Yuan members; (2) The formulation of the method for the Control Yuan members to elect the President and Vice President; (3) The formulation of the voting and ballot counting methods and election procedures for the Control Yuan members to elect the President and Vice President. Regarding the mutual election method, the preparatory committee has drafted a draft for reference by the preparatory meeting. The method stipulates that all members of the Control Yuan are natural candidates, and stipulates that the election must be held with the attendance of more than half of the total number of members of the Control Yuan, and that the candidate who receives more than half of the number of attendees is elected. However, if no candidate receives more than half of the votes in the first round, the top three candidates will be voted on a second time. If no candidate receives more than half of the votes again, the top two candidates will be voted on a third time. In the third round of voting, the candidate with the most votes will be elected. [Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee had decided to recommend Yu Youren for the President of the Control Yuan.

President Chiang invited Kuomintang members of the Control Yuan to a tea party at the Lizhi Society at 5:00 PM on the 5th, and Yu Youren and Liu Zhe were also invited to attend. President Chiang immediately expressed that the party comrades should support Yu and Liu. Some members of the Control Yuan expressed opposition to the idea that since the President of the Legislative Yuan is from the South, the President of the Control Yuan should be from the North, but most expressed support for the candidates proposed by the Director-General. Liu Zhe immediately expressed his gratitude to the members of the Control Yuan. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

### Hu Shi Says He Largely Agrees With Ambassador Stuart's Statement, Japan Can No Longer Become an Aggressor

[Our Beijing Correspondent, 5th] Hu Shi expressed general agreement with Ambassador Stuart's statement. After reading the full text of the statement, he said: "Many of the things in it are things I have said before. My opinion is almost the same as his." When Hu met with reporters this afternoon, he picked up a wastebasket from the corner of his desk with one hand, pointed to it with the other, and said: "There are many letters to me from various places in here. I have been scolded a lot for the US policy toward Japan." But he finally explained the following opinions: First, the United States or any Allied power will not allow Japan to re-arm and restore its ability to aggress. There are many rumors in society. In fact, Japan's navy, air force, even civil aviation, army, and colonies are all gone. Under such circumstances, Japan can no longer become an aggressor. At the same time, the Allies are also unanimous in their opinion on stripping Japan of its aggressive power. Second, the so-called US support for Germany and Japan is actually to restore the production of peaceful industries with their industrial productivity and feed themselves. This enables 150 million people to live a peaceful and minimally decent life. Some people can't help but be jealous. Two years after the war, they have not yet reached a peaceful and safe life, let alone restored prosperity. Seeing that others have recovered faster than us, they feel unfair. Most of the legitimate criticism and fear comes from this. It may not necessarily be completely effective. Some people in industry also feel threatened, such as the British, Indian, and Chinese textile industries, which are all worried. However, going beyond legitimate concerns and talking about the United States retaining industries for wartime enemies is wrong. We are a country that is being supported. If you take support as support for aggressive power, wouldn't that be a big mistake? Hu Shi explained that Japan's recovery is faster because it is under the unified management of MacArthur, rather than the quadripartite division of Berlin and the north-south division of Korea. Because Japan's recovery is fast and China's recovery is slow, we can only worry about ourselves. To be fair, we can't hope that others will be as unlucky as ourselves just because we are unlucky, unprogressive, and unprosperous. So even if it is a legitimate concern, it is also a bit illegitimate. He also said that some people are taking the opportunity to incite anti-American sentiment.

Mei Yiqi Also Expresses Sympathy

And says some people are taking the opportunity to incite anti-American sentiment.

[Our Beijing Correspondent, 5th] Mei Yiqi largely sympathizes with Ambassador Stuart's statement. He believes that it is normal for the United States to support Japan so that its people can live independently, and that it is not intended to restore Japan's aggressive power. Japan has lost its old aggressive foundation. In the future peace conference, China should insist on the veto power, and should not allow Japan to restore the industrial level of the aggressive country after the September 18th Incident. Mei continued to say that those who are currently advocating opposition to the United States supporting Japan are partly because they are concerned about Japan's re-emergence, and it is also a fact that some people are taking the opportunity to incite anti-American sentiment. Stuart's way of making a statement instead of protesting to the Chinese government is correct.

### Full Text of the President's Speech, Encouraging the Full Effectiveness of the Five-Power System, Laying the Foundation for National Peace and Stability

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The following is the full text of President Chiang's speech at the opening ceremony of the first Control Yuan on the morning of the 5th:

The first Constitutional Control Yuan is convening as scheduled today, and I am very pleased. You gentlemen were elected by the provincial and municipal councils, as well as the local institutions of Mongolia and Tibet and overseas Chinese organizations. You are very clear about the people's livelihood and the pros and cons of politics. In the future, you will express your great opinions, gather ideas, and help improve politics and relieve the suffering of the people. You will definitely make great contributions to the country and the nation.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to the National Revolution, the purpose of which was to seek freedom and equality for China, and the method was to implement the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, which is the specific outline of the Principle of Democracy and its essence. If we earnestly follow it, we can make the government virtuous and capable, and the politics clear. The independent exercise of the power of control is the basic difference between the Five Powers and the Three Powers. Therefore, the successful promotion of the power of control is also the success of the ideal of the Five-Power Constitution. From today onwards, you gentlemen have assumed the heavy responsibility of promoting the power of control. The Five-Power Constitution is the most excellent and progressive system, and it will be proven here.

From the Control Yuan of the Tutelage Period to the Constitutional Control Yuan, the legal nature is different, but the actual development process has its own consistency. The Control Yuan of the Tutelage Period was established in the twentieth year of the Republic of China. It has been 17 years since the day of the convocation of this Control Yuan. Initially, it only exercised the powers of impeachment and auditing, and it has already made many contributions. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to meet actual needs, the powers of censure and suggestion were added, and since their implementation, they have been even more effective. Based on past experience, the functions of the Control Yuan stipulated in the Constitution, in addition to changing "suggestion" to "correction" to strengthen effectiveness, also give it the power of consent so that it can also monitor in advance when the country appoints the highest judicial and examination personnel. All of these gradual developments show that the members of the Control Yuan during the Tutelage Period earnestly carried out their tasks and have won the trust of the people, and they also show the great expectations of the country for the Constitutional Control Yuan in the future.

Now that the Constitution has just begun, the people are eager for governance. At the same time, after eight years of war, the country has continued to suppress the rebellion, and the economy is difficult, and the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. At this time, all parties should work together to seek improvement. Although responsibilities are specific, efforts must be consistent. You gentlemen should be able to act in accordance with the wishes of the people and the interests of the country, continue the unfinished work of the Control Yuan during the Tutelage Period, and complete the great mission entrusted to it by the Constitution. I am entrusted by the country to shoulder the heavy responsibility of implementing the Constitution. All the functions entrusted to your Yuan by the Constitution will naturally be followed in accordance with the law so that they can be fully exercised in order to exert the full effectiveness of the Five-Power system and lay the foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the country. I am willing to encourage each other with you. President Chiang delivering a speech at the Control Yuan meeting (Central News Agency photo)

### 工程師節感言

Thoughts on Engineers' Day

工程的民生觀　趙曾玨

The Concept of Engineering as a Matter of People's Livelihood Zhao Zengjue

The practical responsibility of engineers is to "utilize resources for the benefit of the people," and the "people" here should refer to the people's livelihood. In other words, the responsibility of engineers is to use scientific methods, manpower, and material resources to seek a better life for humanity. Throughout history, there has never been a famous engineering project that was not related to the people's welfare, nor has there been a famous engineer who did not seek the people's welfare. Today, on Engineers' Day, the Xia Yu we commemorate and his water control project are the best examples. The water conservancy of Dujiangyan by Li Bing and his son in later generations, and the water conservancy of Guanzhong by Li Yizhi in modern times, are also good examples. On the edge of Shanghai along the Shangchuan Railway, there is a seawall called the Qin Gong Dike, which was built by Qin Yun, the former magistrate of Chuansha County in the Qing Dynasty. It extends for dozens of kilometers from Wusong in Shanghai to the border of Fengxian County, preventing tidal intrusion and protecting farmland. Therefore, although he was a Manchu, the people still praise him to this day. Of course, these water conservancy projects have benefited the people the most widely and deeply, so they are particularly praised by contemporaries and later generations. In fact, other projects, such as the construction of railways, highways, bridges, and buildings, are all beneficial to the people's livelihood.

Currently, there is an even more magnificent and far-reaching project that is almost unprecedented and has made the world look at it with new eyes, considering it the beginning of a new democratic era of people's welfare. This is the TVA multi-purpose project initiated by U.S. President Roosevelt. It is a complex of mechanical and electrical, chemical, civil engineering, water conservancy, transportation, and medical engineering, completely designed and managed by engineers. It is also a complex of agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and health undertakings, and its organization is an enterprise-oriented institution independent of the political system, which is its most distinctive feature. Because it was a creation, it was not without opposition at the beginning. However, because of the efforts of the entire organization and the widespread benefit, it was finally successful. Furthermore, because it can truly benefit the people's livelihood and its effectiveness is obvious, it has finally won the support of the people and has made progressive people all over the world amazed and admired, filled with longing.

Based on the above examples from China and abroad, we dare to say that any government, organization, or individual who can seek the welfare of the people, so-called "bringing the people to comfort," will be supported and will succeed. And these arduous tasks that truly seek the welfare of the people cannot be accomplished without the efforts of engineers. Therefore, the greatest mission of engineers is to solve the problems of the people's livelihood, and in shouldering this great mission, we recognize that: (1) All projects that benefit the people's livelihood are valuable projects. (2) Engineering should aim for long-term achievements and should not be concerned with short-term gains. (3) Engineering is not commerce. Its value should be measured by whether or not it benefits the people's livelihood, and should not be calculated solely in terms of monetary value.

The above three points may serve as the goals of engineers' efforts. As far as our country is concerned, if we still follow the path of an agricultural society that has existed for thousands of years, instead of embarking on the road of industrialization, I am afraid that it will be difficult to survive in the modern world. Therefore, at this time, the responsibility of us engineers is truly unprecedentedly important. If engineers do not build, who will build? If engineers do not push the giant wheel of industrialization, who will push it? Today is Engineers' Day, a day for us engineers to review the past and plan for the future, so I would like to offer some of my humble opinions for everyone's guidance.

工程師的時代使命　徐恩曾

The Era-Defining Mission of Engineers Xu Enzeng

The annual Engineers' Day on June 6th has arrived again. Economic recession and industrial decay, this is a terrible crisis. Should we, the engineers who aspire to build a new China, just sigh and wait for our demise? Or should we awaken, examine ourselves, and do our best? Today's world is truly a world of technological competition. Technologically advanced countries can increase efficiency and reduce costs. Recently, the English version of the Reader's Digest published a small statistic in its May issue, pointing out that if a Soviet worker wants to buy a pound of bread, he has to work for one hour and seven minutes, while in the United States, it only takes seven and a half minutes. That is to say, the efficiency of the United States is ten times higher than that of the Soviet Union. Although capitalists and workers have made great contributions to the technological superiority and industrial achievements of the United States, the contribution of engineers can at least be on par with that of capitalists and workers.

The number of students graduating from engineering colleges in our country is not small, and their academic performance in school is not bad. Engineering students studying in Europe and the United States often outperform their classmates in the host countries in their studies. A few engineers who stay to work in the countries where they studied have extremely good results because they have good working equipment and environment, and they are highly praised by engineers and industrial circles in various countries. However, engineers working in the country often do not use what they have learned. Some engage in politics, some engage in business, and even those who work in their own positions are either teaching in schools or working in technical administrative positions in the government. The number of people who can make a real contribution to China's industrial construction is extremely small. We can also push the responsibility onto the government, onto the industrial community, onto the social environment, but the ambition and aspirations we had when we chose to study engineering, as well as the phenomenon of the country's industrial decline and technological backwardness, will not improve on their own.

Our fellow engineers must change our past passive attitude. We must strive for initiative and strive for the opportunity to serve the country and the industrial community. Of course, we do not want to be lackeys of capitalists, but we should not be preoccupied with planning for ourselves every day, wanting to become capitalists ourselves. Because in other countries, the state's controlled economy policy, the strong united front of workers, and the opportunity for private entrepreneurs to exploit workers' interests and evade government taxes no longer exist. Although there have been many opportunistic elements taking advantage of the chaos in China during and after the war, making a fortune from national disasters and civil wars in a short period of time, we engineers with ambition and ability are unwilling to waste our years of learning and ruin our promising future in this way. Once the situation is stabilized and the country is on track, these speculative elements will be eliminated and purged. Those who have real ability, whose work is the most diligent, and who only plan for the country and the nation, will be the national engineers of the future and the leaders of economic construction in the future.

Today's world has clearly separated into two major camps, labor and capital. Engineers are the natural intermediaries between labor and capital. The modern machines they research and design require huge capital to acquire. Engineers naturally know the contribution of capital to industry. These machines can of course continue to operate automatically in most cases, but they still require a considerable number of workers to take care of them. The contribution of labor is also well known to the engineers who are in charge of engineering work. We need capitalists to be interested in investing, and we need workers to be interested in working hard, not to be lazy, and not to strike. The interests of both parties must be taken into account. Besides the engineers who are on the scene, who else can understand the interests of both parties, and who else can mediate the conflicts between the two parties! 本

Fushun Coal Mine Achieves Record-Breaking Production Increase Since Takeover

— 瀋陽航信　本報記者　趙展

— Shenyang Airmail Dispatch, Our Correspondent Zhao Zhan

The total output of Fushun Coal Mine in May was 146,822 tons, and the output was 93,396 tons, breaking previous records and creating the highest production volume since the takeover. In May of last year, during what was known as the heyday of industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China, the highest monthly output of Fushun was only 137,600 tons, and the output was 79,036 tons. Over the past year, the flames of war have spread, and people generally lamented that the industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China were fragmented and declining daily – the mood of disappointment reached a freezing point. But the miracle created by Fushun is amazing, giving pessimism a head-on blow.

According to statistics from the Fushun Mining Bureau, its record of production increases in the recent three months is: total output in March was 107,622 tons, estimated output was 45,000 tons, actual output was about 50,000 tons; total output in April was 108,784 tons, estimated output was 50,000 tons, actual output was 61,600 tons; total output in May was 146,822 tons, estimated output was 80,000 tons, actual output was 93,396 tons. The highest daily output in May was 6,880 tons, and the average daily output was 4,736 tons. The highest output record was 173 train cars, totaling 5,208 tons, which also broke the previous transportation record. Before March, the average daily coal output was 2,000 to 3,000 tons.

生產鬥爭　「奇蹟」是怎樣造成的？

Production Struggle - How Was the "Miracle" Created?

Wei Hua-kun, the director of the Fushun Mining Bureau, told reporters: "This is the harvest of the workers' shovels and picks, the result of the efforts of all the workers to increase production." Director Wei took over the mining bureau on February 20th. The output on the second day after he took office (February 21st) was 2,339 tons. He explained that the reasons for the low production efficiency at that time were: first, there was no money, and the workers were owed two months' salary and grain and rice allowances; second, the treatment was unfair, the salaries of the staff were too high, and the salaries of the workers were too low. Because of this, the workers petitioned every day and had no intention of working. At the same time, some of the staff were busy escaping, creating a general sense of unease that almost suffocated Fushun. His method was to first repay the workers' debts, filling each worker's pocket with 2 million circulation coupons. He raised the workers' wages, and later it was the staff who petitioned, not the workers. The workers had a day off on May Day, and a grand opera was performed to entertain the workers. On this day, the workers' wives put on rouge and powder, and each child had a bottle of soda. As a result, everyone in Fushun laughed, the workers' hearts blossomed, the desire to produce was stimulated, and a fierce production movement was launched. Circulation coupons competed with prices, and production competed with circulation coupons. A real production struggle brought Fushun back to life. More interestingly, the director declared that he would "commit suicide" to urge the workers.

Fushun has become a complete industrial system. Although it was dismantled incompletely by the Soviet army after the liberation of Northeast China, it still has more than 80 by-products with coal as its center. In the past, the Fushun Coal Mine occupied a dazzling position in the economic resources of Northeast China. Now it is supporting the difficult situation in Northeast China alone, which is even more valuable. From bombs manufactured by ordnance factories to stoves for citizens to cook, they all depend on it.

重要副產

Important By-Products

Important by-products, such as gasoline extracted from oil shale, are as precious as blood in the Northeast, where railways are cut off. Gasoline production was 18,480 gallons in March, increasing to 61,000 gallons in May. The ammonium sulfate, which is most needed by ordnance factories, increased from 307 tons in March to 492 tons in April, breaking previous records. Cement, which is indispensable for building fortifications, increased from 90 tons in March to 304 tons in April. Its steel plant is the only special steel manufacturer in China, and its products are being airlifted to Guannei from June 1st. This steel is the most needed in China, and it used to be purchased from foreign countries. In May, 60 tons of steel were produced, including 22 tons of carbon tool steel in April, 6 tons of spring steel in April, 15 tons of bamboo tool steel in March, and 20 tons of chrome steel in March. In addition, 159 gallons of special diesel were produced in April, 4,000 gallons of mixed machine oil were produced in April, 19 tons of soft asphalt were produced in April, 1,987 cubic meters of oxygen were produced in April, 155 cubic meters of hydrogen were produced in April, 39 tons of sulfuric acid were produced in April, 577 kilograms of liquid ammonia were produced in April, and 227 tons of calcium carbide were produced in May. Some by-product production is too small to be introduced, and many other by-products cannot be produced due to insufficient power.

克服困難

Overcoming Difficulties

Fushun is not without difficulties in the heat of increasing production, but difficulties cannot weaken production. The workers' spirit of assault overcomes the difficult conditions of the objective environment. The biggest difficulties are the lack of funds, food, and materials, which are almost old problems that cannot be solved smoothly. Although the salaries of the employees in March, April, and May have been paid in full, the banks lack cash, and the appropriations from the administrative headquarters cannot be withdrawn on time. Often, when the cash is in hand, the prices have already risen, and the amount that was budgeted as sufficient is now in deficit. Since the method of calculating coal prices based on grain prices has been implemented, the financial difficulties have been reduced. At this time of year when there is a shortage of food, the food problem is indeed serious. Currently, soybean cakes are the staple food for 40,000 workers, and they are eagerly awaiting the ripening of wheat. Although coal production has increased, there is a severe shortage of pit props, explosives, and repair parts for stripping machinery, which are very difficult to purchase and have a great impact. These difficulties vaguely show a layer of shadow on the future of production. From a purely technical point of view, this kind of all-out production increase may have many weaknesses, but in the special situation of Northeast China's crisis, there is only one goal: to produce a large amount of coal.

豆饼小姐

Miss Soybean Cake

Every miner in Fushun has become a labor hero, making Fushun "rejuvenate." What created the "miracle" is the great human power, and what supports this great human power are soybean cakes and soybean residue. On the supplementary page of the "Workers" five-day publication, which was launched on June 1st, a letter from a worker to Miss Soybean Cake was published. He wrote: "Ever since I approached your beautiful face, I have truly felt like we have known each other for a long time. I can't help but call out, 'Dear Miss Soybean Cake!' To be honest, I cannot survive without you." Director Wei Hua-kun said: "Our workers are too lovely, I believe it is absolutely impossible to incite labor unrest."

The production volume and output of Fushun Coal Mine in May broke the record of the three years since the restoration of Northeast China. This great achievement is the result of the unity and hard work of all levels. The reporter saw the workers' high production desire and excited working mood, and was truly moved! It made us know that in the war-torn Northeast, there is a new vitality in industry and mining.

### The Reason Yang Mei Hasn't Eaten for Nine Years - An Answer Must Be Found Quickly - Hu Xianwen and Others Express Their Opinions

[Our Chongqing Office, 5th] Hu Xianwen, the president of the Municipal Zhongzheng Hospital, and Hu Xianhua, the director of surgery, published "What Attitude Should We Use to Evaluate Yang Mei's Non-Eating Problem?", which is divided into: (1) Yang Mei Becomes an International Figure, (2) The Process of Yang Mei's Initial Examination, (3) Should Yang Mei Become a Research Subject, (4) What is Science, and (5) Epilogue. They still feel perplexed as to what kind of mystery explains the fact that Yang Mei has not eaten or defecated for 21 days, and that urination is more frequent than water intake. The article mentioned that there was a person named Succi, who specialized in fasting as a profession for physiologists to study. Once, in an experiment at the Paris Science Museum, he set a record of 50 days without food, which was the highest record of his life. However, after fasting for several days, his weight, physical strength, and mental state consistently declined. By the 40th day, his weight had decreased by 25%. In the last few days, his physical condition was so weak that he could barely sustain himself. In addition, Mayor Terence of England died after 74 days of fasting during the Irish political struggle in 1920. During Yang Mei's 21-day observation period, although no clinical examination was conducted, her weight, physical strength, mental state, and breathing were even better than the two individuals above in terms of tolerance to hunger. Her pulse and temperature remained unchanged. Therefore, regardless of whether it is due to a special physiological mechanism, pathological changes, or artificial pretense, it should be studied with a purely objective attitude to find an answer as soon as possible.

President Hu and others believe that scientific research should focus on facts and seek experimental results. It is too risky to make a judgment on the reason for Yang's non-eating after only 21 days of initial observation. They also stated: A scientist's mind should be like a pure, flawless blank sheet of paper, without any inherent colors. They must observe natural phenomena with a purely objective and open-minded attitude, integrate the results of various experiments, analyze them in detail, and seek affirmative or negative answers based on facts. Yang Mei has not eaten for 21 days without significant abnormalities. Scientists should follow this phenomenon to distinguish right from wrong. If it is concluded that Yang Mei's long-term non-eating is a foregone conclusion and cannot be explained by existing knowledge, then they should correct some past theoretical errors and look for a new scientific path. It is essential to avoid ignoring or being stubborn, thinking that it is inconsistent with existing theories, and abandoning existing opportunities, phenomena, or facts. This would be a great loss for scientists exploring the true meaning of the mysterious universe. Currently, many people are deeply interested in Yang Mei, influenced by the nine years of not eating. However, scientists should maintain an absolutely objective attitude. They personally participated in observing Yang Mei's 21 days of non-eating, which is a fact that ordinary people cannot do. Therefore, Yang Mei is a scientific research subject, and there should be no doubt about it. The Hu brothers finally stated: The reason for this mysterious non-eating must be found as soon as possible to avoid confusing social rumors.

[Another Dispatch] The Ministry of Health has not yet issued any instructions regarding Yang Mei's non-eating incident. The Bureau of Health has recently sent the observation report of Yang Mei's three weeks to the Medical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health.

### US House Passes Bill to Reduce Funds for European and Chinese Aid - Burch Advocates Restoring Japanese Aid Fund

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] The US House of Representatives passed a bill from the Appropriations Committee during a voice vote today, reducing the $463.3 million in the China Aid Program by $63.3 million. It also reduced the government's foreign aid amount to $5.9 billion, $71,000, and $228. Supporters of the government are hoping that the Senate will restore the $533 million in foreign aid that the bill has already cut when it votes on the bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee has not yet completed its review of the foreign aid bill, so the Senate Appropriations Committee may restore the amount cut by the House Committee. Since the motion to amend the European Recovery Program and the China Aid Program, which proposed reducing the period to one year, was rejected, the House of Representatives passed the foreign aid bill without making any major modifications. The aforementioned amendment, which proposed reducing the aid period from 15 months to one year to proportionally restore the reduced foreign aid amount, was ultimately rejected by a vote of 148 to 113. The China Aid portion of the bill was only slightly modified, as the House passed Zhou Yide's amendment, slightly modifying the wording of the regulations regarding the supervision of the use of funds to make the meaning more tactful.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th, United Press] According to senior official sources, Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has made a commitment to the Department of the Army and the State Department that he will do his best to get the Senate to resume discussion of the $150 million plan to assist Japanese economic recovery, which the House Appropriations Committee has already refused to approve.

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The government now hopes that Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will be able to restore the $553 million cut by the House of Representatives when the Senate discusses the foreign aid appropriations bill. The passage of the Marshall Plan in the Senate in April was thanks to Vandenberg. It is now known that Vandenberg is once again working on this matter. Senator Connally, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that the House's vote would definitely be overturned by the Senate. Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, stated that he would first study the matter before expressing his opinion prior to the Senate vote. Opponents of the cuts all stated that Congress's inconsistency would shake the faith of European democratic countries in the United States and strengthen the Soviet Union's movement to communize Western Europe. Rayburn, the former Speaker of the House, who does not often speak, also stated today that we should fulfill what we promised to friendly nations just a few weeks ago. If we are too stingy, we will only be mocked by Moscow.

### Greece Notifies the Balkan Committee of Its Willingness to Negotiate a Peace Treaty with Albania - Responding to Moscow's "Peace Offensive"

[Reuters, London, 4th] Authoritative sources in Greece revealed: Greece has notified the United Nations Balkan Committee, declaring that it is prepared to negotiate a peace treaty with Albania. According to a Greek spokesperson, the Albanian government declared war on Greece in 1940, so the Greek government still recognizes that a state of war exists between Greece and Albania, and a peace treaty should be used to end it.

Diplomatic observers here believe that whether this action by the Greek government can lead to peace in the Balkans depends on whether the issue of the Greek guerrilla movement can be resolved. The fact that Greek guerrilla commander Markos made a tentative peace broadcast on June 1 may still be part of Moscow's recent peace offensive. The broadcast stated that the Greek guerrillas were prepared to discuss any proposal aimed at ending the fratricide. Before Markos made that broadcast, the governments of Bulgaria and Albania had also stated that they were willing to resume relations with the Athens government under certain conditions.

[United Press, London, 4th] The Communist-controlled "Greek Democratic League" on the 4th called on Britain to promote a peaceful settlement of the Greek civil war. Observers said that Britain would likely refuse. In addition, a radio station in the guerrilla mountains of northern Greece announced on the 3rd that rebel commander Vafiades would negotiate peace in Greece. Greek government leaders rejected this proposal.

South Africa recognizes its partnership in the Commonwealth, so it does not intend to adopt an isolationist policy. Regarding South Africa's position in the United Nations, the policy of this government is completely consistent with that of the previous government, that is, South Africa's accession to the United Nations is based on the understanding that its internal affairs and sovereignty will not be interfered with by the outside world. We will continue this policy and refuse to tie our destiny to any great power or organization.

These brides are the same age as the Princess and married in the same week as the Princess last November. The list was compiled by Buckingham Palace staff and women's volunteer services. The Shroff Company believes that this is the most appropriate way to celebrate the Princess's wedding.

### First Naval Battle Between Arab and Jewish Forces - The Army Attacks the Coast of Tel Aviv - The Jewish Defense Forces Counterattack

[Reuters, Haifa, 4th] A Jewish military communique stated: The Israeli Navy, the coastal batteries of Tel Aviv, and the Jewish Air Force jointly repelled an attack by four Egyptian warships on the coast near Tel Aviv shortly before 2:00 PM on the 4th. After four hours of fierce fighting, the Egyptian ships retreated. At least one bomb dropped by Jewish aircraft scored a direct hit.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 5th] Here, we are waiting for a full report on the attack by Jewish gunboats and aircraft on Egyptian ships. This naval and air battle was clearly visible in Tel Aviv on the 4th, with flames soaring into the sky. It is said that an Egyptian destroyer has been sunk. Officials announced that an Israeli aircraft dropped a bomb and hit an Egyptian ship. The entire battle lasted about three hours. The Israeli Air Force, Navy, and coastal defense forces confronted an Egyptian fleet including a gunboat, an armored transport ship, and two British-style landing craft. One Jewish aircraft is missing. The Jewish side claims that one Egyptian ship has been hit and the other three have fled. The Jewish fleet did not pursue. The Egyptian side claims that the Egyptian fleet sank one of the three Jewish warships. This is the first naval battle in the Arab-Jewish war.

### Jewish Immigration to Palestine Hinders Arab-Jewish Armistice - Bernadotte Denies Issuing Armistice Order

[Reuters, Cairo, 4th] After visiting Jewish and Arab leaders in Haifa and Amman yesterday, the United Nations Palestine Mediator arrived in Cairo today and held a 90-minute meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi. According to Bernadotte, the main obstacle to the armistice negotiations is the point of prohibiting Jewish immigration to Palestine during the armistice period.

### Major Sulfur Explosion and Fire on Honan Road: Over a Hundred Injured, Fire Chief Dies in the Line of Duty; Food Storage Facility Blamed, Neighbors Suffer, Losses Beyond Estimation

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 5:10 PM, sulfur stored at the Zhongfa Warehouse, number 10, Lane 333 on Honan Road, suddenly ignited during transport, leading to a fire. The large quantity of sulfur then caught fire and exploded, causing a major disaster with over a hundred casualties and widespread damage to neighboring properties, resulting in a tragic fire comparable to the boiler explosion at the Zhen Tai Rubber Factory on February 21st, 1933, the worst in over a decade. The incident occurred during the Eastern District's office closing hours, causing traffic congestion. Pedestrians, suddenly hearing a deafening explosion followed by smoke filling the sky, fled in panic. Nearby residents and shops hurriedly closed their doors, creating chaos. Windows and large glass panes in the surrounding areas, including Nanking Road, Kiukiang Road, Honan Road Central, Hankow Road, and Shantung Road, were almost entirely shattered by the explosion, with estimated losses exceeding hundreds of millions of yuan. The fire department dispatched fifteen fire engines from various districts of the city, using over thirty water hoses to battle the blaze. Water supplies were temporarily exhausted, requiring a request to the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company to increase water pressure in the affected area. The fire, reaching over a thousand feet in height and covering two hundred square feet, was brought under control at 5:50 PM. The flames were extinguished around 7:00 PM, after burning for approximately two hours. In addition to the complete destruction of the Zhongfa Warehouse, Xie Da Pharmacy, and Shuntai Paper Company, neighboring businesses such as the News Daily, the Shang Bao (Commercial Daily), Lao Zheng Xing Restaurant, Tong Hua Lou Restaurant, and the Tonghui Bank dormitory were also affected. The News Daily's warehouse, being in close proximity to Zhongfa, was unfortunately burned down. The Shang Bao suffered water damage internally, resulting in significant losses. Fire Chief Yu Changgen, a veteran of the Central District team with twenty-one years of service, was struck by a column of fire ejected from the explosion as he arrived at the scene, dying instantly. Forty-six injured individuals, including firefighters, coolies, pedestrians, and residents, were transported to various hospitals, their names recorded. Three of them succumbed to their injuries by 1:00 AM this morning. Approximately sixty others sustained minor injuries. The cause of the incident and the actual extent of the damage are currently under full investigation by the police.

### A Deafening Explosion, Black Smoke Billowing, Fire Department Personnel Rushing to the Rescue, Many Without Time to Don Fire Gear

When the fire broke out, it initially went unnoticed due to the warehouse's location deep within the alley. However, when three workers covered in flames ran out of the alley next to the News Daily, passersby noticed and rushed to remove their burning clothes. Their skin was severely burned. One of them collapsed immediately, a horrifying sight that sent onlookers scattering. Shortly after, white smoke billowed into the sky from Qing He Li, Lane 333, Honan Road, at precisely 5:10 PM.

The Fire Department's Central District team, located south of the intersection of Honan Road and Hankow Road, only a stone's throw from the scene, saw the white smoke rising. Firefighters, many without time to don their fire gear, departed immediately. One engine headed to Hankow Road, another to Kiukiang Road. The white smoke spread and thickened. Just as firefighters unrolled their hoses, preparing to enter the alley and extinguish the flames, a sudden and deafening explosion occurred. A column of black smoke shot up a thousand feet, and flames spread like an umbrella, emitting intense heat. The time was 5:20 PM. Following the explosion, a burning wooden beam flew out of the fire scene and landed on Fire Engine number 31, which had just stopped in front of Lao Zheng Xing Restaurant, fatally striking Fire Chief Yu Changgen in the head, killing him instantly. Fire Chief Qiu Xiangyun was also seriously injured.

Eight Water Hoses Couldn't Quell the Fire

Firefighters bravely connected the water hoses and began spraying water from both Kiukiang Road and Hankow Road. However, despite the efforts of eight water hoses, the sulfur fire raged fiercely and was difficult to control. Soon, the lookout towers of the Hongkew, Jing'an Temple, and Yichang Road fire stations all spotted the towering flames. Ten pump trucks from Xinzha, Hubei, and other districts were dispatched to assist. At the same time, the Central District team sent a large pump truck, a ladder truck, and a hose truck, concentrating on the area around Shantung Road, Hankow Road, Honan Road, and Jiujiang Road, increasing the number of water hoses to over thirty. As a result, nearby water taps were insufficient. Chief Ye of the Fire Department urgently telegraphed the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company to increase water pressure in the fire area, desperately fighting the fire.

The East Wind Fanned the Flames, Spreading the Fire Everywhere

The Zhongfa Warehouse was quickly consumed. Flames spread to the News Daily's paper warehouse to the east, Xie Da Pharmacy to the west, and Shuntai Paper Company at 275-277 Kiukiang Road and Lao Zheng Xing Restaurant at 273 Kiukiang Road and Tong Hua Lou Restaurant at 281 Kiukiang Road to the north. The east wind was strong at the time, causing the flames to spread westward to the Shang Bao Building at 289 Kiukiang Road and the Tonghui Bank's upper-level dormitory on the third floor at 295 Kiukiang Road. After forty minutes of desperate effort from the firefighters, the fire was brought under control.

The Two Newspaper Offices Suffered Severe Losses

At the News Daily, in addition to the complete destruction of the paper warehouse, the employees' dormitory on the fifth floor, the workers' dormitory on the third and fourth floors, and the copperplate photography and darkroom were also affected. All the glass windows on all floors at the rear of the building were shattered by the sulfur explosion. The north-facing wall was cracked from the shock. Two printing presses in the printing department were damaged. On one of them, the lead plate melted due to excessive heat, and molten lead flowed into the machine's interior, making it difficult to repair. The motor components were damaged by water, making them unusable for the time being. Furthermore, the damage to paper, ink, and other printing materials was difficult to estimate. At the Shang Bao, the employees' dormitory on the third floor was completely destroyed, and the editorial and interviewing department on the second floor and the printing department below suffered water damage, resulting in substantial losses. The fire was completely extinguished by 7:00 PM.

When the fire broke out, Zhou Zhaoxiang, Director of the Central Fire Department, supervised the rescue efforts with Zhongdui Deputy Zhang, Section Chief Ye Binyong, District Captain Zhu Zhifeng, Deputy Captain Lin Bohua, and personnel from various district teams. Deputy Chief Wang of the Ambulance Headquarters and officials from the Port Fire Department also arrived at the scene. In addition to officers from the Criminal Division of the General Bureau and the Flying Fortresses and the Security Police Brigade, Feng Wenyao, Director of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, accompanied by Li Yinmin, Chief of the Criminal Section, also led police officers to the scene, working with military police to maintain order. Shortly after the fire broke out, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping also arrived to personally direct the operation. The firefighters' spirit of selflessness was highly praised by nearby residents.

Cause of the Fire

The cause of the fire was that at approximately 5:00 PM yesterday, the Zhongfa Warehouse received a large shipment of sulfur from the Shi Fu Ji Transportation Company at Lane 318, Tiantong Road. While seven coolies were unloading the sulfur, it accidentally caught fire. They were unable to extinguish it, and within minutes, the fire spread to the sulfur pile, leading to an explosion. The three workers seen running out of the alley next to the News Daily were coolies who had been participating in the rescue efforts. The sulfur reportedly belonged to the Xinsheng Match Factory. Furthermore, it was learned that one coolie was missing and may have perished in the fire.

Extensive Glass Shattered

Dozens of shops on various roads suffered shattered glass windows, including: News Daily and Steamship Industry Association on Hankow Road; Lihua Company and Lao Jie Fu Silk Shop on Nanking Road; Lao Jiuhe Silk Shop at the Wangping Street intersection; Meizuishi Barber Shop and Dayuan Industrial Pharmaceutical Raw Materials Company on Honan Road; Chunhua Tang Paper Fan Shop and Shengchang Ginseng Shop; Yonggu Paint Company and Huiqiao International Trading Company; Futaihe Silk and Cloth Store and Hexiang Trust Company; Dajicheng Leather Goods Shop and Farmers Bank Trust Department; Lixin Accounting Bookstore and Printing Company and Shihe Jewelry Store; Yuji Jiuhuatang and Huiwentang Bookstore; Farmers and Merchants Bank and Baoji Jihuatang Paper Fan Shop; Hengfengchang Leather Goods Shop and Tianxiecheng Ivory Shop; Liqun Stationery Store and Huaxingli Watch Shop; Fuxing Ginseng Shop and Central Daily News. Xindemao Funeral Supplies Shop and Dazhong Evening News on Shantung Road; Madunhe Hat Shop and Yuanyuan Hat Shop; Guang Shen Factory and Da Hu Barber Shop; Huangjin Printing Company and Meili Printing Company; Wanlong Paper Company and Huachang Trading Company; Yida Printing Company and China Paper Cutting Company and Weilo Advertising Agency. Hecheng Bank and Xinzheng Money Shop on Jiujiang Road.

### Passenger and Freight Transport Price Increases on the Two Railways: Likely to Take Effect Tomorrow; Passenger Transport Up 50%, Freight Transport Up 90%

[Report from this newspaper] The railway price increases that have been brewing for over a month may take effect tomorrow. According to Xie Zhen, Deputy Director and Transportation Director of the Two Railway Bureaus, who told reporters late last night: Passenger fares will be adjusted by 50%, and freight rates by approximately 90%. This is likely to begin tomorrow. However, the Railway Bureau has not yet formally received the order from the Ministry of Communications. The above information was relayed by telephone from the Railway Bureau's Beijing Office. Therefore, whether the new prices will take effect tomorrow depends on whether the Ministry of Communications' price increase order arrives in time. It is also learned that this price increase will be graded for freight, with general goods increasing by 90% and valuables by 100% to 120%. The Railway Bureau is currently calculating the new fares based on this principle.

### Authorities Supervise and Dissuade Students; The Large-Scale Demonstration Did Not Materialize; All Places Were Quiet and Uneventful All Day Long

[Report from this newspaper] The "Association Against American Support for Japan," organized by a segment of students in this city, had originally planned to unite all schools in the city yesterday morning to hold an anti-support-Japan demonstration. However, thanks to the supervision and dissuasion of the relevant authorities, including the security police, military police, and education officials, the demonstration was ultimately frozen separately.

At around 10:00 AM, to prevent students from using Bund and Zhongshan Parks as assembly centers, the security authorities temporarily closed those parks. At Jiaotong University, military police were stationed tightly, preventing the demonstrating students from taking a single step. At Tongji University, only a few demonstrating students left the school early, and the next group of demonstrating students was dissuaded. At Fudan University, at around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, more than 300 students gathered, preparing to depart from the main gate, but after being dissuaded by military police, they attempted to find several shortcuts and leave by circuitous routes, but all were dissuaded from returning to the school. There was a brief altercation at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, which was quickly quelled. Demonstrating students at the China Vocational and Technical College of Industry and Commerce were also dissuaded by military police on Zhu Bao San Road. On the Bund, more than a thousand students and middle schoolers gathered after 3:00 PM, but they dispersed separately around 6:00 PM. The details of the dissuasion efforts are as follows:

### The Ordeal of Persuading Students at Jiaotong University

After the Jiaotong University Student Union held a symposium on the "Oppose American Support for Japan" issue on the evening of the 3rd, it convened a meeting of representatives from all departments on the afternoon of the 4th and 5th, deciding to request a day off on the 5th to hold a "Oppose American Support for Japan, Rescue the National Crisis Demonstration," and contacted other schools to participate. After learning of this, the school authorities, led by President Cheng Xiaogang, convened a meeting with the student union's officers and responsible persons from each department late into the night, earnestly persuading them from 10:00 PM until 3:00 AM the next morning. Zhao Zengjue, president of the Shanghai Alumni Association of the school, and Police Commissioner Yu Shuping also arrived at the school to dissuade the students. Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education and Mayor Wu contacted President Cheng by telephone, asking him to stop the students' action. However, all the dissuasion efforts were ineffective, and the students insisted on their original position. The school then posted a notice late at night on the 4th, making a final appeal, stating: "We have just learned that this afternoon, the Student Union convened a so-called meeting of department representatives without the approval of the school and openly launched a move to request a day off and go out to demonstrate on the 5th. These students are disregarding their studies to take alarming actions and are acting arbitrarily without the school's permission, which is highly inappropriate. The school has convened a meeting of the heads of all departments and determined that the demonstration should be strictly prohibited to avoid causing trouble and that classes should be held as usual to maintain academic integrity. Anyone who ignores the school's good-faith dissuasion and insists on their position, and if an accident occurs as a result of insisting on going out to demonstrate, in addition to being subject to legal sanctions, the school will impose severe penalties for violating school rules." President Cheng Xiaogang and the heads of various departments, including Wang Zhiche, Qiu Weiyu, Zhong Zhaolin, and sixteen others, also issued a written statement, declaring: "If the students still do not understand the good intentions of our persuasion and stubbornly insist on their views, we will deeply feel that our guidance has been inadequate and will have no choice but to resign collectively."

Due to the persuasion of the teachers, the Student Union convened an emergency meeting of department representatives at 10:00 AM yesterday to reconsider the resolution on the large-scale demonstration. President Cheng and several professors attended the meeting again to persuade the students. President Cheng earnestly explained the relationship of various interests, urging the students not to be swayed by temporary emotional impulses, but to use reason and make wise decisions to cancel the demonstration. President Cheng stated that opposing American support for Japan does not necessarily have to be expressed through a general request for leave and demonstrations, and can also be done through issuing declarations and other methods. If the students still insist on demonstrating and the school's persuasion fails again, then he and the professors will decide to resign. The department representatives reconsidered the question of whether to demonstrate, and until 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the result of the vote was still to decide to demonstrate. At that time, the security authorities had already dispatched a security police brigade, two battalions of security police, and a company of youth soldiers, along with more than ten tanks, and had arrived in the Xujiahui area, cutting off nearby traffic and surrounding the school's front and back gates to prevent the students from leaving the school to demonstrate. The Jiaotong University students inside the school then assembled a team of three or four hundred people at around 2:00 PM, each carrying cartoon flags, and marched around the school once. Because the front and back gates were closely guarded by military police outside, they could not leave and remained in a stalemate for a long time. The team then shouted various "anti-support-Japan" slogans in the school before dispersing. The military police guarding outside did not withdraw until around 9:30 PM in the evening.

### Forty-Six Seriously Injured, Three Died This Morning

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, approximately one hundred people were directly or indirectly injured in the fire. Apart from some with minor injuries who were bandaged and discharged, there was one death on the scene: Yu Changgen, a first-class driver of the Central Fire Department. Those seriously injured and sent to the Police Hospital included firefighters Yin Xiangyun, Lou Guangchun, and Xu Longzhang. Those sent to Renji Hospital included News Daily workers Ji Xianchang, Yang Guangxiong, Chen Defang, Zhou Qiaosheng; temporary transport workers from Shi Fu Ji Transportation Company on Tiantong Road Wang Defu, Yu Dingshu, Lu Yinchang; Wang Yingchuan from Hecheng Bank; Wang Suichu from Lao Jiuhe Cloth Shop; and passersby Xue Guigen, Gu Lunfa, Xu Yonglin, Xu Ruige, Sun Xiaomei, Chen Tianci, Wang Tiefu, Yang Guangrong, Lin Tingshu, Yu Huisheng, Li Bingyuan, Wu Genrong, Qiu Caiyu, Chen Yuqing, Xu Jiaqi, Qian Ailong, Wang Caigao, Peng Bise, Xu Yonggen, Tan Yingqiu, Zhong Xiaoyin, Ni Jindu, Ding Xindu, Zhu Youwei, and Wu Miaokun, totaling thirty-four people. Those sent to the China-America Hospital included passersby Yan Xigao, Cui Li-shi, and Bao Genxiang, the person in charge of the Zhongfa Warehouse. Those sent to the Gongji Hospital included Shi Fu Ji workers Lu Liechang, Shi Yizhou, and passersby Yue Dingyi, Chen Defang, Kang Quanfu, and Wang Renxiang, totaling six people. In total, there were forty-six seriously injured men and women, including firefighters. Among them, Shi Fu Ji workers Wang Defu, Yu Dingshu, Lu Yinchang, Lu Liechang, and Shi Yizhou were closest to the explosion and therefore sustained the most severe burns. This morning at 1:00 AM, Lu Liechang, Shi Yizhou, and Wang Defu had succumbed to their injuries, and the lives of the remaining two were also in danger.

### Approximately A Thousand Students Singing Songs and Shouting Slogans; Lining Up on the Bund Sidewalk; Traffic Disrupted, Park Closed

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the Bund, there were rumors that students were gathering at the Bund Park. Therefore, starting at 10:30 AM yesterday, the security authorities closed the Bund Park, temporarily suspending its opening. In the morning, there were no obvious signs of students gathering on the Bund. However, on a section of the Bund road, there were small teams of military police patrolling back and forth. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, more and more students gathered. Because the Bund Park had been temporarily closed, they lined up on the sidewalk from numbers 24 to 28 on the Bund, numbering approximately a thousand, mostly middle school students. When inquiring individually, the students belonged to universities such as John's, Jiaotong, Datong, Daxia, and Fudan, and middle schools such as McLaren, Chuneng, and the Tongji Affiliated Middle School. The security authorities also successively dispatched four squadrons of security police and a squad of mounted patrols to supervise the lined-up students separately. Apart from singing songs and shouting slogans, the students took no other action. Some students who attempted to leave the group were temporarily detained. For a time, the Bund was crowded with onlookers, and traffic was somewhat disrupted. Around 6:00 PM, the students began to disperse individually or in small groups.

### Mayor Wu Held a Press Conference to Report on the Course of the Students' Special Actions; Instructed Jiaotong University Authorities to Conduct an Investigation into Seven Points

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the decision by students in the city's universities and middle schools to request a day off yesterday to hold a large-scale "Oppose American Support for Japan" demonstration, Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan held a press conference in the city hall's auditorium at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. First, Mayor Wu reported on the special actions of Jiaotong University students, stating: Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Jiaotong University convened a meeting of all departments and ended the meeting at 5:00 PM. The meeting resolved to request a day off today and hold a large-scale demonstration. After receiving the report, the school's president immediately tried to stop them, but to no avail. After hearing the news, Mayor Wu and Police Commissioner Yu, believing that the demonstration violated the emergency measures during the suppression of rebellion period and had to be strictly prohibited, ordered the school to inform the students that if an accident occurred as a result of the demonstration, the students would be fully responsible, and the government would bear no responsibility. At the same time, the school's president and more than twenty professors jointly signed and issued a notice, warning of two points: (1) Collective demonstrations violate school rules, and participants will be severely punished according to school rules. (2) If the students are stubborn and insist on going out to demonstrate, the professors will be responsible for failing to supervise and educate them and will have no choice but to resign collectively.

Investigating the Reasons for the Students' Insistence; The Authorities Believe They Were Manipulated by Communist Bandits

After this, the president and professors again did their best to persuade the students to abandon the demonstration, repeatedly arguing with the students for a long time, but the students still stubbornly insisted. Their final and only reason was: "Today's large-scale demonstration was jointly decided by one hundred and twenty organizations in the city, and they must go to the Bund Park to assemble as agreed and depart together."

Based on the above reasons for the students' insistence, the municipal authorities believe that the demonstration was clearly being manipulated by Communist bandits. Because the Jiaotong University department meeting only made the decision the day before the demonstration, how could they have coincided with the other one hundred and twenty organizations without any coordination? Therefore, the municipal authorities believe it is extremely necessary to investigate. Mayor Wu said that if such an incident occurred in a foreign country, a prosecutor's office could be convened immediately, ordering the perpetrators to answer publicly. Now, in order to respect the school authorities, the school is requested to be responsible for investigating the initiators of this demonstration and publicly answer the questions. Otherwise, the government will order them to hand over the perpetrators and pursue legal proceedings.

Official Document Sent to Jiaotong University

The municipal government sent an official document to Jiaotong University yesterday, stating the seven points that should be investigated as follows: (1) Who requested action from the department representative meeting? (2) Who advocated for a strike and demonstration at the department representative meeting? (3) Who proposed a lunch gathering at 11:00 AM and assembling at the Bund at 1:00 PM within the department representative meeting? (4) The department representative meeting began at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and ended at 5:00 PM. When did they contact the one hundred and twenty organizations and decide to depart together and assemble at the Bund? (5) If they only began to contact them after the vote at 5:00 PM, what method did they use to contact the one hundred and twenty organizations so quickly (which is impossible)? (6) If they contacted the various organizations before the department representative meeting to take joint action, then who represented Jiaotong University and where and with whom did they connect? (7) What are the names of the one hundred and twenty organizations, and who is in charge?

Student Unrest Affects Public Security; Citizens Should Be Wary

Commander Xuan said in his address that the large-scale demonstration was entirely a planned conspiracy by the Communist Party. After receiving the news, the government dispersed and dissuaded them. So far, students from various universities have been unable to leave their schools under the protection of military police. Those gathering on the Bund are all middle school students. Commander Xuan expressed his satisfaction that yesterday's demonstration did not succeed. However, Commander Xuan was quite wary of future student unrest. He stated that student unrest in this city has been waiting for an opportunity to move since May. Although it has not yet caused a major disaster, he believes that after more than a month of cultivation, the foundation of each school has become solid. The bandits, seeing that their potential influence in each school has gradually grown, will definitely find ways to use it. He predicts that future student unrest will likely affect public security, and citizens should be wary.

Strictly Investigate Professional Students

Mayor Wu emphasized that the students' outrageous actions are by no means patriotic. Their demonstration slogan is "Oppose American Support for Japan," but in reality, it is to oppose American aid to China. The government will strictly investigate and severely punish these special professional students.

### Fifty-Four People Suspected of Inciting Student Unrest Were Arrested; Ten Were Detained and the Rest Were Released on Bail

This morning (June 6th) at 1:00 AM, the City Police Bureau announced that the security agencies had arrested a total of fifty-four suspects related to inciting student unrest on the 5th.

### East Caohejing Female Corpse Case: Key Suspect Arrested in Nanjing, Major General Commissioner Chen Xiwu Escorted to Shanghai

[Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 5th] On the morning of May 17th, a female corpse with over twenty knife wounds was discovered on the bank of a small river west of Shanghai at Jiangnan Zhongjiafen Shanxi, East Caohejing. This case was reported in this newspaper on May 18th. Following an investigation based on clues obtained at the scene by Chen Guangwu and other members of the Shanghai Police Bureau Criminal Police Team, a major suspect, Chen Xiwu, was arrested in Nanjing on the 5th. He was escorted to Shanghai by train that evening for interrogation. It is hoped that the arrest of suspect Chen will lead to the complete resolution of the case. After the discovery of the female corpse, a piece of letter paper was found on the body. The sender was Ms. Lin, the wife of Huang Senhua, an employee of the Budget Department of the Nanjing United Logistics Headquarters. The Shanghai Criminal Police Team immediately dispatched Chen Guangwu and others to Nanjing to investigate. They learned that Huang Senhua's wife was the sister of the deceased. The deceased's name was Lin Xinying, 28 years old, from Meixian, Guangdong. She married Chen Xiwu in her early years. Later, due to the War of Resistance, Chen went to work in the interior and married a woman who supported the war effort. This woman who supported the war was the wife's younger sister of Wang Jun, a former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Military Affairs and currently a Legislative Member. After the restoration, the two wives lived together, and there were frequent disagreements. Chen Xiwu is currently a Major General Commissioner of the Traffic Police Headquarters of the United Logistics Headquarters. Chen Guangwu and others investigated the Traffic Police Headquarters and confirmed that Chen had two wives, and there were frequent quarrels. Chen's whereabouts were recently unknown. Based on various suspicious points, Chen Guangwu and others believed that Chen Xiwu was a major suspect. With the assistance of the Criminal Police Team of the Capital Police Department, Chen was arrested at Liyuan, Nanchang Road, on the afternoon of the 5th and escorted to Shanghai by train that evening for questioning.

### Wuxi Cocoon Shops Stop Weighing: Fresh Cocoons Exceed Price Limit, Suspension of Agricultural Loan Payments

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 4th] Since the opening of cocoon shops in the countryside on the 3rd, cocoon farmers have been holding back, unwilling to sell. This has caused the price of fresh cocoons to exceed 30 million per picul, a significant difference from the協道會 (Association) limited price of 26 million. On the afternoon of the 4th, all 102 cocoon shops in the county that were granted loans stopped weighing because the 協導會 (Association) and the China Farmers' Bank suspended loan payments, making it impossible to collect cocoons. That night at 8:00 PM, relevant parties from the 協導會 (Association) and the Cocoon Shop Association held an emergency meeting and decided to request the authorities to continue the loans. The manufacturers will temporarily try to pay the excess. If the authorities do not approve this method, weighing will continue to be suspended on the 5th. This matter has attracted widespread attention.

### After Adopting the Method of Exchange Settlement Certificates: Suggestions from the Bristle Industry

Since the implementation of the exchange settlement certificate policy, the difficulties faced by export industries have not been completely resolved. The Shanghai Bristle Export Association specifically submitted requests to the Export Control Commission and the National Bank yesterday, seeking remedies. Regarding the difficulties, the association pointed out:

(1) The validity period of the exchange settlement certificates is too short, the demand is insufficient, and they cannot be sold smoothly. Moreover, the selling price is decreasing daily, while the black market exchange rate still exists. After a temporary decline, it has rebounded sharply, exceeding the sum of the official rate and the certificate price by more than one-third. As for the domestic prices of export commodities, they already exceed the overseas selling prices by a large margin. Since the announcement of the new policy, the prices of all goods in producing areas have soared, making costs exceptionally high and unmanageable. Because commodity prices have long followed the black market, if the exchange rate cannot approach the black market rate, there is no hope for promoting exports.

(2) After the increase in commodity prices in producing areas, exporters need even more capital. However, designated banks still provide packing loans at 70% of the official rate, which, combined with the commodity prices in producing areas, only amounts to 30% of the value. Exporters must advance 70%. Under the dual pressure of high commodity prices and tight credit, where can such enormous strength come from to continue purchasing goods in producing areas? It is inevitable to significantly tighten operations or face a standstill.

(3) Under the flexible exchange rate policy, exporters could still roughly calculate costs when purchasing goods and decide on the timing of shipment and exchange settlement to barely cover costs when selling. Now, the official rate can be changed at any time, and the selling price of the certificates is not known in advance. With these two unknowns, even if the goods have been shipped, it is impossible to predict the proceeds. For example, if a batch of goods is ready to be shipped, and exchange settlement is done based on the official rate, but the official rate rises again before the certificate is sold, causing the market price of the certificate to fall, the magnitude of unexpected losses for that batch of goods is not difficult to imagine. Exporters must take these two risks, making it even more difficult to develop business.

Regarding hopes for improvement:

1. The validity period of the exchange settlement certificate is limited to only seven days, making the timing urgent and the target hard to find, especially at the beginning of the new policy. There are not many import licenses for importers. The procedures of designated banks are not ready, the supply and demand situation is unclear, and the standard of market prices is not determined. Everyone is watching. Even if there are transactions at this time, they are very few and far from fair and reasonable prices, resulting in a large difference from the market price outside the circle. To express their support for the new policy and maintain overseas credit by shipping on schedule, members of the association have enthusiastically settled exchanges on the date of the policy announcement, amounting to a considerable sum. The certificates will expire in a short time and cannot be sold to date. It is requested that before the supply and demand reach equilibrium, the market price cannot be determined daily by the designated bank, and before repurchase at any time, the time limit be temporarily extended to one month, and then the appropriate time limit be determined based on actual needs.

2. The main purpose of the new method is to allow the selling price of the exchange settlement certificate to find its level in the market to reach a price that suits the actual situation. It should be allowed to develop fully and naturally, and artificial manipulation should not be used to change the parity rate at any time, so as to repeat the mistakes before the reform and lose the spirit of the new method. Moreover, the dual exchange rate will further deepen the stimulation of commodity prices and increase the risk of exporters. This layer should be clearly announced to reassure people.

3. Packing loans should be made by notifying the designated banks to change the total amount of the parity rate and the approximate price of the certificate, and lend at 70%, which is still rediscounted by the Central Bank. The term is proposed to be two months, so that traders have sufficient time and financial resources to purchase goods in the producing areas.

### University Games Close - St. John's University Achieves Double Victory - Tongji University Runner-Up in Men's Group, Soochow University Runner-Up in Women's Group - National Medical College and Lixin Accounting School Win Men's and Women's Championships in College Group Respectively

[Our Newspaper] After two days of competition, the third joint sports meet of colleges and universities in this city successfully closed yesterday. St. John's University's strike and exam schedule did not prevent all male and female athletes from upholding the noble spirit of sports, giving their best efforts, and winning the overall championships in both the men's and women's university groups, which is particularly commendable. The runner-up in the men's group was Tongji University, and Soochow University and Jiaotong University won the third and fourth places respectively. Soochow University ranked second in the women's group, and Jinan and Guanghua University tied for third place. In the college men's group, the National Defense Medical College took first place with an overwhelming lead, followed by the Shanghai Law School, and then Lixin Accounting School. In the college women's group, Lixin almost swept all the first places, scoring a total of eighty-six points, far away from the runner-up National Defense Medical College's twenty points. Shanghai Law School, Shanghai Normal School, and Shanghai Dental School tied for third place. The entire competition concluded at half-past seven, and Mrs. Ling Xianyang presented the awards and declared the closing.

### Two Relay Races Tense and Exciting

Yesterday, the most intense events were still the two relay races in the university group. In the men's 1,600-meter relay, St. John's Jiang Weiliang took the lead in the first leg, exceeding the rest by three meters. Soochow University's Xu Zuyuan gradually caught up in the second leg, and Sun Jiawen continued the effort in the third leg, maintaining the lead. Jiaotong University's Wang Nancun also caught up to second place. In the last leg, Yang Yongfang, the 400-meter champion of Soochow University, left the dust behind, breaking the record held by the school with a time of three minutes and fifty-three seconds and six tenths. St. John's, relying on the efforts of Lai Hui'er in the last leg, surpassed Jiaotong University's Liu Zhenzhong within the last twenty meters, winning the runner-up. Jiaotong University was third, and Tongji University was fourth.

In the women's 400-meter relay of the university group, St. John's and Soochow University gave their best efforts, and the competition was no less intense than the men's race the previous day. St. John's still relied on the final sprint to overwhelm Soochow University. In the first leg, St. John's Li Jiaqiao, Soochow University's Wu Anqing, and Great China's Zhang Gui ran side by side, finishing simultaneously. Soochow University had more practice and was skilled in the baton exchange. Chu Bingyi relied on this leg to surpass St. John's Guan Shixian slightly. In the third leg, St. John's Feng Puzheng caught up to a tie, arriving at the same time as Soochow University's Zeng Chaoqun. In the last leg, Soochow University took the lead again with a hotter baton exchange. Li Miao desperately chased, but Wang Shan was not weak either, holding on until the last ten meters. Li Miao finally relied on her extraordinary stamina and ran shoulder to shoulder with Wang Shan. At the finish line, Li Miao leaped with all her might, winning the championship by half a step, with a score of one minute and one second and two tenths, breaking the college record of one minute and two seconds and nine tenths created by Soochow University.

### Small Scenes

Lixin's female generals performed very well in the college group. President Pan Xulun personally came to encourage morale until the conference was about to end.

Tongji's Mai Mingda, the champion of the 400-meter hurdles, suddenly dropped a shoe after jumping over the third hurdle. Mai Jun ignored everything and continued to run forward, which is commendable.

The cheerleading squads were out in force yesterday. In addition to St. John's and Soochow University, there was also a new force from Lixin. St. John's cheerleading squad also invited an assistant instructor from the Department of Chemistry to lead the team, adding a lot of color.

The cheerleading slogan that was most appreciated by the audience was the "flowing lyrics": "The flowing water stops on the mountain, then flows down the mountain, top notch!". Ms. Qian Hangsu, a senior hurdler, was also watching the game yesterday. The athlete who became popular in the previous National Games is now a teacher at Jinan University and the Sports College.

Wang Nancun, a long-distance runner from Jiaotong University, was the last leg of the torch relay for the Seventh National Games to arrive at the venue. Yesterday, when Wang ran the last lap of the 5,000-meter final, applause rang out. Wang had a hundred times the courage. His popularity among the audience was no less than that of Lou Wen'ao, the deaf-mute runner.

The cheerleading squads of St. John's, Soochow University, and Lixin were initially very competitive. As the closing was approaching, they turned enemies into friends and supported each other. St. John's first shouted: "Soochow is good, Soochow is wonderful, Soochow Soochow is great!". Lixin also shouted: "St. John's is good, Lixin is good, everyone is good!"

The female athlete No. 434 of Soochow University was praised by students from St. John's and Soochow University as the flower of the conference, and she was inseparable from the male athlete No. 57, so the latter was also honored with the elegant title of "Prince of the Conference".

On the individual side, the strongman Bao Lai still won the triathlon championship. Since the beginning of the college sports meet, the triathlon championship has been regarded as a forbidden area by Bao Lai, and no one has ever been allowed to get involved, which is also rare.

Jiaotong University's Wang Nancun won the 800-meter, 1,500-meter, and 5,000-meter middle-distance championships, replacing Soochow University's Lin Canran from the previous session, and is tied for first place with Bao Lai. They rival each other. (Chang Xin)

### Hang Liwu Discusses Anti-Americanism at Jinling University Board Meeting

Expresses Regret for the Actions of St. John's University Students

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th] Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, delivered a speech at the board meeting of Jinling University in Nanjing on the morning of the 5th, stating: "I would like to take this opportunity to describe the abnormal anti-American brewing in recent years. This matter lacks a normal reason and damages Sino-American friendship. The excuse of the anti-Americans is that the United States' policy towards Japan is too generous, which is enough to promote an industrialized Japan and threaten China and world peace. This point is not correct, because the entire reparations issue and the procedures by which Japan will be allowed to industrialize are still under careful consideration by the Far Eastern Commission. Even the so-called Dreep and St. Hanssen reports are not official documents accepted by the US government. Secondly, we must remember our country's established two-sided policy towards Japan, that is, to strictly prevent the resurgence of a militant and aggressive Japan, while at the same time adopting a tolerant and far-sighted policy to allow Japan to live and trade peacefully. We believe that this is also the common policy adopted by other United Nations, including the United States. The current measures taken by the United States in Japan are completely consistent with the policies it pursues in Europe and the Far East, that is, to assist war-damaged countries to revive self-help. Unless we are willing to adopt revengeism and force the Japanese people to take risks, we should not object to this policy. In view of the long and sincere traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples, it is regrettable to allow the anti-American sentiment, which is mainly caused by incitement, to spread with such excuses, especially in St. John's University, which is established by the church. Moreover, the cultural relationship between China and the United States and the contribution of the United States to Chinese education have always been the source of friendship between the two countries. The Chinese government and people are deeply grateful for the cooperation and assistance of the United States, and should not allow Sino-American relations to be damaged by irresponsible actions."

[Associated Press Nanjing 5th] Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, said in a speech to the board of directors of Jinling University today; It is especially regrettable that anti-American sentiment has spread to church schools, such as St. John's University in Shanghai. According to well-informed sources: Hang's speech was actually made with the consent of Foreign Minister Wang.

### Wen Zhaotong: New Topics in Art Education

For the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Art Education Society

History tells us that art education is not a new thing. "Zhou Shangwen, the rituals and music were prepared for the systems of the four dynasties, and the sound and teaching of cultural relics were called flourishing." In the West, Plato's art education thought was popular in the era more than two thousand years ago.

However, in the 20th century, in the atomic age today, and in China, which has a long historical tradition of art education, why should we promote art education and improve art education?

The reason is of course simple, because today's China does not pay enough attention to art education, and it is suffocating art education. We might as well look at the following many facts:

Everyone feels the headache of "comic books" is something that must be banned, and must be improved. The government has repeatedly ordered and prohibited it, but it is still at large. Recently, the Teacher Welfare Association of the Municipal Schools of this city had a surprising analysis in the Research and Development Work Exhibition to tell everyone:

(1) "Comic Books" began to be published in the fifth year of the Republic of China and have now been sold all over the country and Southeast Asia.

(2) It is estimated that there are 1,000 rental stalls in this city, with an average of 80 readers per stall per day, totaling 80,000 per day. If each person is charged a rental fee of 5,000 yuan, the total daily consumption on "comic books" is 400 million yuan.

(3) Its content: The characters are: ghosts and gods, wizards and diviners, warriors and knights, local tyrants and bullies. The form is: incomprehensible text, distorted records, and ugly pictures. The ideology is: ghosts and gods reward and punish, impartial and selfless, find good feng shui, and future generations will surely prosper.

Please look at the school: art class, crafts class, mostly teach children to imitate adults, imitate established methods, some schools even cancel these point embellishment nature of the subjects, the UK is considered to be able to be promoted to school.

Anyone who cares about art teachers says that there is a lack of teachers. Therefore, training art teachers is regarded as a necessary proposal on the meeting table. But how to train? What kind of training to be? Few people have considered it. Moreover, are the existing art teachers not changing careers? Are they not unemployed?

There are too many erroneous and contradictory phenomena like the above, it's really innumerable. We are art educators, we want to correct these errors and eliminate these contradictions. This is actually like the current "eliminating illiteracy", just sweeping here, there is illiteracy again.

I am not pessimistic, we always focus on traditional art education, and art education itself will not develop upward. It can be said that even the above-mentioned erroneous and contradictory evil forces cannot be resisted. Not to mention correcting and eliminating it, but on the contrary, maintaining its survival.

Because most art educators are still dreaming of the artistic views and educational views of the scholar-official class. This is the traditional thought at work, but also the inevitable ideological reflection of the traditional old society, and "comic books" "imitation education" "promotion education" are a pack, and are unified in nature.

The new topic of art education in China today is the need to transform the consciousness of art education workers themselves. They should quickly accept the guidance of realistic aesthetics and democratic educational philosophy, and then transform the essence of art education, and use the power of art education to promote social progress. When our country throws off the heavy shackles of external and self-imposed shackles and stands freely and independently on the world, art education will certainly have a broader, deeper, and more rational power to express itself.

### Remembering "Fu Manchu"

— Ping Zhai

Dr. Fu Manchu, a man of extreme height, abnormally thin, with a pale complexion, slender fingers, fingernails exceeding an inch in length, eyes gleaming with a green light, addicted to opium, with an exceptionally rich intellect, mysterious and unpredictable in his behavior, fond of probing into secrets, with accomplices spread across the globe, frequently engaging in murder and smuggling... and one more thing: he is Chinese!

However, he does not exist. He is merely a character in the novels of the American detective fiction writer Sax Rohmer. His name should be Fu Manchu, and "傅曼殊" (Fu Manchu) is my translation of it.

Rohmer's "Grotesque Horror Detective Novels" (to borrow a phrase from cinema advertisements) have been published in dozens of editions and sell extremely well, ranking prominently among the most popular detective novels. And the protagonist of each novel is always this mad "scholar" who commits all kinds of evil: Fu Manchu. Recently, since May 8th, the American "Collier's Weekly" has once again begun serializing a "Fu Manchu novel." Fu Manchu is practically immortal.

I have read two or three hundred detective novels written by British and American authors, and whenever I encounter Fu Manchu, I feel deeply uncomfortable, as if smelling the foul water of the Suzhou Creek while crossing the Sichuan Road Bridge in the sweltering summer heat—it's simply nauseating. However, I think we should also reflect on ourselves.

What does Fu Manchu represent? He is base, treacherous, greedy, and cruel. If we read more works by Europeans and Americans, we can probably still find many traces of suspicion towards the Chinese in the words between the lines, right? Chinatown is always mysterious because China itself is unfathomable; therefore, they often use the word "Inscrutable" to describe China. As for Fu Manchu's extraordinary intellect and sophisticated methods, they symbolize a foreign perception of China's millennia-old civilization, as if saying: "They are truly remarkable—but I still can't make heads or tails of them."

In all fairness, I don't think that Rohmer, the creator of "Fu Manchu," necessarily intended to portray the Chinese as such a dreadful figure. I think Rohmer is just an ordinary, average American. Maybe he happened to see a few paintings of Chinese court ladies (how long those fingernails are!), wanted to add some exotic flair to his novels, and at the same time, he had read some books about the Boxers. Thus, the long fingernails were there, the drawing of talismans and hand gestures were there, the moving of mountains and overturning of seas were there, and the invulnerability to guns was there—plus a "doctorate" to show respect (?!), and Dr. Fu Manchu was born.

He may not have intended to "disrespect" the Chinese, just as Huang Zuolin didn't necessarily think he would offend all the barbers in the country when he wrote "Fake Phoenixes Courting." However, the bad thing is that the "Fu Manchu novels" sell very well, reaching the hands of many ordinary American people who are similar to Rohmer—the result is probably not going to be good for China; just as Hollywood movies about outlaws like Jesse James and Dillinger would not create a good impression in China.

If China and the United States want to talk about cooperation, then first of all, we must seek mutual understanding between the people of the two countries. This responsibility is mutual, and we should also take responsibility and tell people that although China is not paradise now, bound feet and queues have already disappeared, and elderly Chinese people don't necessarily like to grow Fu Manchu mustaches, and they certainly don't allow the mustaches to expand indefinitely to the left and right, turning into two wisps of rat whiskers. Although the Chinese emphasize precociousness, they are not all necessarily harboring sinister intentions. In short, "Fu Manchu" can "die"!

Seeing "Fake Phoenixes Courting" going abroad, especially the news that this film has been dubbed in English, I am very happy. This is China, this is the Chinese people! Look, isn't Shi Hui humorous? Isn't Li Lihua beautiful? How are the Chinese mysterious? Where is the shadow of that deadly "Fu Manchu"?

However, on the other hand. If an American friend in Shanghai points to the stone figures at the racecourse and asks me: "You said the Chinese are not mysterious, very true, very true. I just want to ask you: when did that pair of stone figures become immortals?" How can I answer him!

### Cooking

— Shi Wen

When King Henry VIII of England was in power, there was a pastor in the country who hired a cook named Richard Roose. Unexpectedly, Roose was a beast in human form, and he poisoned two members of the pastor's family to death. Henry VIII was furious when he heard about this matter. Because the cook was skilled in cooking, he issued an edict to build a large pot, hung it high, and placed a large pile of firewood burning fiercely underneath. He ordered Roose to be "cooked" in the pot and burned to death alive. According to historical records, the cook screamed miserably in the pot for a full hour. When he died, his entire body was bright red, and his hair resembled a large red prawn, it is said.

### Iron Lung Hospital

— Mao Yi

When people talk about iron lung patients, the Chinese immediately think of Farrad Schnyder, who suddenly contracted polio in Beiping before the war. Schnyder is just one of the iron lung patients. There are many other iron lung patients scattered around the world, and the concentration of iron lung patients is in the newly established "Respiratory Center Station" at the Children's Hospital in Baltimore, USA. Here, nine adults and teenagers lie individually in iron lungs, using the pulsation of the iron lung to support their breathing and lives.

They have one advantage over solitary iron lung patients: they are not lonely. They have become a group, encouraging each other, comforting each other, and keeping each other company. They cultivate confidence. Although getting out of the iron lung seems far away, it is not without hope.

Iron lung patients are the most tragic victims of polio and are the most difficult to treat. In these patients, the respiratory muscles are often paralyzed in the same way as the hands and feet. They must lie flat on their backs in a huge iron machine. Air is pressed into the interior of this machine, replacing the weakened muscles in performing respiratory work. Iron lung patients truly lose the freedom of movement, and their field of vision is also limited. They can only see the scenery reflected in the mirror hanging in front of their eyes on the iron lung.

The "Respiratory Center Station" was founded in June 1946 by the "National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis" of the Maryland Pastoral Association, and is supervised and managed by Dr. George Barnard. Its purpose is twofold: first, iron lung patients need 24-hour care a day. Living together with nine people is more economical than living alone, and it can prevent them from feeling lonely and sad psychologically; second, this facilitates complete clinical experiments—both medically and psychologically.

### More on Inksticks

— Semi-Dreaming Old Man

Since ancient times, the method of making inksticks has always been to take soot or pine resin, mix it with benzoin and storax, add castor oil and deer horn for glue, pound it tens of thousands of times with a mortar and pestle, and melt it into a ball. It is then molded into cakes or ingots. The best are those that are as hard as stone and have a black and shiny color when ground. Those considered the best throughout the ages are the Xu Xuan Moon Round, the Tang Xuanzong Dragon Fragrance, and the Li Tinggui Dragon Pattern Double Ridge.

The new ink produced today is best in Huizhou, such as that from Hu Kaiwen, Cao Sugong, Zhan Dayou, etc. The soot used for raw materials is all purchased from overseas, mostly accumulated ash from factory chimneys, which is coarse, heavy, and light in color. The glue is also not as good as what was used before. The so-called top soot or five hundred catties of oil on the ink surface are also not real. It is difficult to prevent the deterioration of manufacturing methods with this. Calligraphers and painters do not use new ink but seek ancient ink, which is also due to this.

I saw a type of Li Tinggui ink on display at the Old Palace Exhibition Hall. The ink box was engraved with the "Record of the Ink Cloud Studio" made by Emperor Gaozong of Qing, which stated, "Bi Yuan presented an ancient inkstick, one foot long, two inches wide, and two-tenths of an inch thick, the box engraved with Chao's record, believed to be from Monk Fayi's collection, the item of Li Tinggui of the Southern Tang." There was also an ancient ink song written by Dong Zhelin: "The ink jade is one foot long, the jade is hard, and the ink is brittle. With the hardness of jade and the goodness of ink, it is rare to see this Tinggui production. From the Five Dynasties to today, it has been nearly a thousand years, Fayi's collection, Chao's record, its shape, engraving, and description are recorded in detail. The wind and moon of the Hanlin can be vaguely identified, the whole body is full of thick clouds brewing rain, and this spring's sweet rain benefits agriculture, returning to the earth with spiritual blessings. Yan Liu and Wei Dan only spread their names, who recognizes the Wei ball and Jin snail, Su Shi once commented on tea and ink; virtue and integrity are like good scholars. The oak box and brocade pouch are heavily stored, how can the dragon guest bear to have Concubine Zhao test it, then self-conscious and self-deprecating; the traveler mastiff plays with objects to praise virtue, what is the point of treasuring talents without employing them, and feeling ashamed to store the ruler for too long." This is the poem first sung by Emperor Gaozong of Qing. The record also stated, "The ministers were ordered to harmonize it according to their own ideas, without having to adhere to the style and rhyme, it is also a beautiful story of the West Lake," the ink is as solid as jade, with patterns like rhinoceros horn, said to be made by mixing twelve items such as gamboge, rhinoceros horn, pearl, and croton, truly a priceless treasure.

Li Tinggui's ink has never been discontinued. The ink with the inscription "邽" (Gui) on it is the best, the one with "圭" (Gui) is the next best, the one with "珪" (Gui) is again the next best, and the one with "奚廷珪" (Xi Tinggui) is the worst. Tinggui's original surname was Xi, and he was later granted the surname Li, which I have described before. The Essentials of Antiquity states, "Li Tinggui's ink has two grades, the one with dragon patterns and double ridges is the best, and the one with a single ridge is the next best." However, it is not often seen, and the manufacturing method has been lost. Other ink makers have not been able to match it.

Zhou Gaoshenfu wrote "Qing Shang Jian," using four-character phrases to discuss ink: "The wonder of ink, its substance should be light, its soot should be blue, it should have no fragrance when smelled, it should have no sound when ground, new inkstone and new water, it should be ground effortlessly. (It is said that it cannot be ground with force.) Avoid haste and heat, heat makes it raw, use the inkstone to rotate, the inkstone should not be left for a long time, dust and grime pollute the ink, and the glue becomes muddy. Wash it after use, and do not let the ink accumulate too much, the glue will age after being stored for a long time, and the ink will be refined when used." This speaks specifically about using ink, not about storing ink. The purposes of those who use ink and those who store ink are different. Users do not need to talk about storing, and storers do not need to talk about using. But storing without using, how can you know the beauty of the ink? Beauty is not in the appearance of the ink. But if it is stored for too long, then the intention of grinding it for use will also naturally be exhausted, and it is better to keep it as a plaything.

Among the three inksticks of the Lingxiaohan Pavilion, which was destroyed, and the hundred scenic inksticks of the Mountain Resort, and one of the five hundred Arhat inksticks of Qianlong, most were made in the Qing Dynasty. I used to have two circular jade pendant-shaped inksticks made in the Ming Dynasty, which were lost in the chaos of the Japanese pirates. Only a Heart Sutra inkstick made in the Qing Dynasty remains in my traveling trunk, one side engraved with the entire Heart Sutra, and the other side engraved with a statue of Sakyamuni Buddha, with the four seal characters "Original Face" written on it, and a note stating that it was made by Subida, prepared for writing scriptures. Speaking of collection, my interest has not yet reached, and my strength has not yet attained. Li Tinggui was proficient in making ink and also skilled in poetry, which people do not know. His poem says: "I give you a black jade pendant, the clear spring inkstone must be clean, hang the Ge bag to avoid the summer heat, and pass the plum moon in the wind," which is beyond what Fang Yulu and Luo Xiaohua could achieve.

### Fighting Yellow Birds

— Yi Yun

This newspaper reported that the Shanghai Shicun Society held a great yellow bird fight at the City God Temple in Nanshi, gathering nine hundred birds, paired into four hundred and fifty pairs, divided into groups for fighting, with crowds of spectators, which was very lively. Readers of this news may regret not having gone to see the grand event, or say that this should not be done at this time of crisis. Now, based on what I know, I will talk about yellow birds.

It is really difficult to find a bird with good fighting talent. Among these nine hundred birds, I don't know how much selection and elimination it took to get to this point. I heard that the method of selecting birds is to first look at the bird's eyes, then look at the bird's feathers, and then look at the bird's body. Those with bright eyes are not chaotic in battle, and every attack hits the mark, and they are also good at defending against the enemy, leaving the enemy with no chance to take advantage of, as the saying goes, "A general's pair of eyes frightens the enemy." Those with hard feathers can still fight more and more bravely, and will eventually win, even if they suffer heavy blows. Those with strong bodies have enough strength and power, and can definitely endure battles. The method of catching birds is to set up nets to trap them in winter. These birds fly low in the winter, gathering in thorny bushes. Set up nets nearby and startle the birds to make them fly into the net, and they can be caught. In spring, they often fly high, so it is advisable to lure them with cages. Hang the cage in the shade of a tree, with multiple doors open inside. The doors are equipped with mechanisms, and a bird is kept closed in the cage to attract them; the birds are lured and fly into the cage door, and as soon as they step on the mechanism, the door closes and they cannot get out. However, when encountering good birds, they come to find a fight. Their momentum is fierce and they tend to peck at the birds in the cage, so the cage birds must be carefully selected. Weak birds are always scared back by the birds that come, and dare not speak, or even fly wildly in the cage in extreme fright, which cannot lure good birds into the cage. It must be a bird that can be fought with in order to not be suppressed by the birds that come, and can lure good birds, but it is not possible to fill it with old birds that are good at fighting, because their fighting power is strong and their fighting momentum is strong, so the birds that come are afraid and dare not enter, and bird keepers do not want to put good birds in the cage of lure birds, because this cage is most likely to ruin the birds. As for the bird's fighting methods, in short, it is nothing more than the head and feet. What is meant by the head? That is, being good at pecking at the enemy's head. When two birds approach each other, both sides peck at each other and avoid each other. Those with bright eyes, quick beaks, and age always peck at the enemy's head, causing them to lose feathers and bleed. When the enemy pecks back, they can skillfully avoid it, making them miss. When the enemy bird is repeatedly pecked painfully, their mind is flustered, and they take the opportunity to advance quickly, extending their feet to tightly embrace the enemy bird's head. At this time, the enemy bird has been captured, unable to break free, and its head is under its beak, allowing it to peck at will, the head feathers are all gone, the flesh and blood are a mess, and even the eyes are blinded and the neck is disabled, so they can only mourn and escape. This fighting method is commonly known as "embracing the head and opening," and cannot be achieved by those who do not have bright eyes, quick bodies, and thick strength. What is meant by the feet? That is, specializing in taking the enemy's feet to win. Taking advantage of gaps, they quickly drag the enemy's feet across the silk, and when the enemy's feet are dragged, their head and body are overturned behind them, unable to peck forward. In severe cases, they take the opportunity to drag again, and occupy the enemy's feet with their body and claws. At this time, the enemy's feet are all captured, and it is impossible to break free by struggling, allowing the feet to be pecked open, and the skin and flesh are all removed. Those who are severely injured can hardly stand on the cage frame, and often fall to the bottom of the cage. This fighting method wins with skill, and bright eyes and quick claws are also its special strengths. In general, those who are good at the head inevitably suffer from the feet, and those who are good at the feet inevitably lose to the head. Heroes who are good at fighting have difficulty winning against strong enemies. Ever-victorious generals often suffer setbacks due to old age, and there are those who are known to be good at fighting but suddenly collapse when they encounter an enemy. This is related to the art of raising them, causing them to have diseases that cannot be known, so the bird's victory or defeat is greatly related to the bird's body fatness and whether the feeding is good.

### Two Recent Poems

— Zhang Yiqu

Returning from the Newspaper Office in the Middle of the Night

Old and new drafts are picked up late at night,
Worrying about errors in my literary work,
The lamp illuminates the ancient wall, casting green eyes,
The mirror fears my declining face, showing white to my beard,
Crazy words after drunkenness seem to have been gained,
Leisure time is without sweetness except to sleep,
Returning home in the middle of the night, the landscape is quiet,
A curtain of moonlight hangs over the hundred-foot building.

Feeling from the Fierce Fighting Outside the Pass

The tracks of the wheels, the language, and the writing are not entirely the same,
The universe looks up and down, but my feelings are heartfelt?
Recently, more white hairs have grown,
As I grow old, my face is only red with wine.
The beacon fires of war pass before the eyes,
The landscape is without proclamations and my headache grows worse,
I want to ask Wang Wei with a sad heart.
Where can joy be found without fighting?

The terms "Golden World" and "Golden Age" both express extreme prosperity, one in terms of space and the other in terms of time. The preciousness of gold has been unanimously agreed upon throughout ancient and modern times, in China and abroad, precisely because its nature has the highest monetary value. However, in old China, even as recently as the late Qing Dynasty, copper coins were still used as currency; as for silver, only large official items, valuable goods, and special items were valued in silver. (Han Gong in *Zhu Sha Zhi* said to Wu Sheng, "Above all things, silver is a good thing, a treasure." Truly a common sentiment.) But silver was not really currency, its shape was either round ingots or loose chunks, and it was always necessary to use weighing instruments when using it, and the weighing instruments were of various kinds, which was extremely troublesome. (In Wang Tangchun's play, Su San confessed that in the darkness of the night, there was no balance or scale, and with a hand weigh, it was only three hundred taels. Luckily it was a gift to someone, if it were to buy something, it would have to be weighed.) Silver dollars were imported goods from the middle and late Qing Dynasty, used from southern China, so later Chinese-made ones were also commonly called "foreign money," and silver became currency. Furthermore, Su San recounted that the young Master Wang brought three hundred taels of silver the first time he entered the house, and left after drinking a cup of fragrant tea, which surprised the officials on the stand with his generosity. Su San also confessed that he brought thirty-six thousand taels of silver the second time, and it was all spent in less than a year, which greatly shocked the officials on the stand, who questioned, "Could it be that you eat silver and wear silver?" So Su San opened up and reported her expenses: gold basins and jade bowls, brocade gardens, ten thousand flower pavilions, many projects, all enough to show the extravagance of the thirty thousand taels of silver. Silver is already like this, how much more so is gold! Lu Sheng in *Deyi Lu* says, "A man has gold under his knees," and then laughs and says, "My legs are made of gold," although they are all lines from a play, it is enough to reflect that gold at that time was only a standard precious object, and for practical use, it was even rarer than silver, so even "balances and scales" were rarely disturbed. Yu Boya in the Ma'anshan play uses "two ingots of gold" to give a generous pension to the old father of Zhong Ziqi, which is occasionally seen in play scripts.

In ancient times, gold was called "several ingots" (like ancient ink), and also called "錠" (ding, ingot). Now, it is often called "several bars" (each bar ten taels), like cigarettes. Each cigarette bar has ten boxes, and each box has twenty cigarettes. This is also an American-style trend since the victory. In the past, ten cigarettes were common, and twenty were also occasionally available, and large boxes had five hundred cigarettes in a whole box, and two hundred and fifty cigarettes in half a box. Now, in addition to bars, there are also large cases. Cigarette bars seem to be more convenient than boxes in the past. Gold bars also seem a bit more modern than the "笏" (hu, scepter) or "large ingots" of the past. This is not a matter of great importance, but many transactions and entrances and exits, as well as the ill-gotten wealth of corrupt officials and the black market operations of unscrupulous merchants, often involve several or dozens of bars (or roots), which is a modern trend, and even more obvious. The old-style worship of gold and the new-style "spending of gold" have merged into one, which has become a deformed state of a "bar" or "root" society.
