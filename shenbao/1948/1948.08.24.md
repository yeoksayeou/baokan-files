[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] President Chiang Kai-shek, after presiding over the Central Memorial Week ceremony on the morning of the 23rd, immediately summoned Weng Wenhao, Yu Tiecheng, and Hong Lanyou to inquire about the implementation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs. He also learned that Weng would visit the President again on the evening of the 23rd to report on the market situation on the first day after the implementation of the Emergency Measures. Reports from major cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beiping, Tianjin, and Hankou were also telegraphed in the evening. The general situation was extremely good, and many people went to exchange U.S. dollars and gold. The President was deeply gratified to hear of such good results on the first day. It is also learned that the President will still go to Kuling within the next few days.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The 23rd was the first day for people to exchange gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan Certificates. The people of Nanjing went to the Central Bank to exchange them voluntarily, presenting an unusually enthusiastic state. The excellent results have exceeded the expectations of the average person. According to the figures obtained from the overnight statistics of the Nanjing branch of the Central Bank, on the 23rd, U.S. dollars totaling 54,391 yuan, silver coins totaling 22,311 yuan, pure silver weighing 104 taels, Hong Kong dollars totaling 3,709 yuan, and gold totaling 1,747 taels were collected. The final settlement was not completed until 2 a.m. on the 24th. In total, 2.38 million Gold Yuan Certificates were exchanged on the 23rd, equivalent to 71.4 trillion Legal Tender. The people's enthusiastic exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan Certificates, in addition to fully demonstrating the deep patriotism of the people, can also serve as the greatest guarantee that the currency reform will be successful.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The Gold Yuan Certificates were officially issued on the 23rd. The exchange situation in Nanjing was very enthusiastic, and prices mostly trended downward. Banks, money shops, trust companies, and credit cooperatives, which had been closed for two days, resumed operations on the 23rd. The Nanjing branch of the Central Bank handled the work of collecting and exchanging gold, silver, foreign currency, silver dollars, and Legal Tender, and was still engaged in clearing and sorting until midnight on the 23rd. All the staff worked through the night. The number of Nanjing citizens who went to the Central Bank to exchange Gold Yuan Certificates on the 23rd was very large. Even those who went to exchange in the light rain were still unusually enthusiastic and came in an endless stream. Citizens automatically lined up, and the queue stretched from indoors to outdoors, from the Central Bank's Nanjing branch in the Jincheng Building to the U.S. Aid Utilization Commission in the Fuji Building, a distance of several hundred meters. Some even waited for several hours. The situation of people holding gold, silver, and foreign currency to exchange for Gold Yuan Certificates was particularly enthusiastic.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The 23rd was the first day for the national banking and financial industry to resume operations after the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs.

### President Weng Reports on the Government's Current Important Measures at the Kuomintang Memorial Week, Guaranteeing Social Order and Establishing a Stable Foundation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Kuomintang Central Committee held a memorial week ceremony on the morning of the 23rd. President Chiang Kai-shek personally presided over the ceremony, and Premier Weng Wenhao attended to report on the government's current important measures. Premier Weng stated: "The most important things that must be carried out earnestly at present are two things: one is to prohibit and curb the destruction and harassment of bandits and spies, in order to protect social order; the second is to stop currency inflation and market fluctuations, in order to achieve economic stability. In fact, social order and economic stability are two things that are interrelated and mutually influential. They are really the same thing. The government's work must proceed simultaneously and receive a consistent response from the hearts of the people in society in order to achieve substantial results."

"Recently, the government has been working diligently on these tasks and has already begun. It is waiting to persist and continue without懈怠 in order to fully realize them. Important situations are briefly explained as follows:"

"First, it is to investigate and imprison spies in various places in the rear who are being used by bandits and spies. Recently, these spies often挑拨离间 stir up trouble and incite student strikes, worker strikes, and other trends, resulting in riots and disturbances. In order to protect social order and maintain order, the government must be responsible for presiding over the matter through the competent authorities. The military and police are working hard to assist in suppressing violence, which is the way to appease the good, and punishing evil is the way to curb chaos. In order to ensure a fair trial, all those involved in the case will be handed over to special courts for investigation and research in accordance with the law, and they will be dealt with promptly according to the severity of their circumstances. Everyone must understand that this suppression of bandits and spies is purely to safeguard the foundation of the nation and protect the people. The great righteousness is obvious. The meaning lies in the fact that the government has previously issued announcements to the people, distinguishing right from wrong, and jointly facing national difficulties. Our founding father devoted himself to the national revolution and established the foundation of democratic politics. Our President unified the country, sincerely resisted Japan, recovered the lost territories of the past 50 years, and abolished the unequal treaties of the past 100 years. The Chinese Communists have always borrowed names to harm the country and the people. The facts are obvious. I sincerely hope that people in society will understand justice, not go astray, and promote the proper demeanor that a citizen should have."

"Second, it is to reform the currency system, implement the cessation of currency inflation, and provide the country with stable and reliable currency. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the amount of Legal Tender has been relatively large. However, the whole country has been looking forward to construction in a peaceful environment after Japan's surrender, in order to achieve well-being as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the Communist bandits disregard the overall situation and deliberately disrupt it, year after year. The amount of Legal Tender issued has therefore increased even more. In addition, there are often unscrupulous merchants in the market who speculate and hoard goods, smuggle and evade taxes, and engage in various activities, which have led to rising prices and insecure lives. The national economy and people's livelihood have suffered deeply. The Gold Yuan Certificates that are now being issued are aimed at preventing this abuse. First, there is full preparation, which is publicly announced; second, there is a limited amount, which will never be inflated; third, there are large quantities of metal transfer coins to facilitate circulation; fourth, the government will earnestly support international trade and other legitimate uses in accordance with the prescribed exchange rate. Therefore, it can maintain a solid and reliable reputation, which is sufficient to eliminate the various unstable factors of the past. According to modern economic theory, currency is the basis of various economic phenomena. Currency inflation will inevitably lead to market unrest, while currency stability will allow trade and exchange to have a reliable value and a sufficient medium of credit. Once the source is clear, the water flow will naturally be correct. At the same time, the government has decided on a policy to increase revenue as much as possible and to save expenses properly, in order to achieve a budget balance. It should also increase export trade and encourage smooth overseas remittances in order to improve the balance of international payments. Once the basic conditions are thoroughly improved and a correct track is established, there is no reason for market prices to be more affected. The government has painstakingly planned and adopted this method of treating the root causes and clearing the source. For those unscrupulous merchants who still intend to destroy it, they should be regarded as public enemies of the nation and the people, and they should be strictly prohibited and severely punished. The government will never allow the selfish interests of a small number of people to harm the bright phenomenon of this new era."

"Third, it is to collect and store all gold, silver, and foreign currency within Chinese territory. According to the common practice in modern countries, these foreign exchange, gold, and silver, and foreign currency are not allowed to circulate freely or be used as tools in the speculative market. This measure stipulates three outlets: (1) to be used to exchange for Gold Yuan Certificates; (2) to purchase U.S. dollars at official prices; (3) to establish foreign exchange deposits in national banks, retaining their ownership and still being available for legitimate purposes. Such a measure is extremely preferential. By handling it in this way, the ownership is preserved and it can still be used for legitimate purposes. It is truly beneficial and harmless. If the original holder hesitates to avoid it and still refuses to exchange or deposit it in accordance with the legal outlets after the statutory deadline, then the original holder despises the law, harms the public interest of the country out of self-interest, and therefore, once discovered, it should be confiscated and turned over to the public. This is truly a punishment that fits the crime and is by no means harsh. In addition, there are still a few places, such as Guangzhou, where Hong Kong dollars are used, and Qingdao, where U.S. dollars are used. These are extremely irregular behaviors that must be quickly improved and exchanged for Chinese banknotes. This is a proper behavior that a citizen should have, and it is hoped that it will be realized quickly. There are also some people who like to leak domestic funds to foreign places to purchase property. At a time when the country is in dire need of funds and the government is earnestly striving, the actions of these people are the opposite, forgetting their own nationality and becoming actions that harm the country. From the perspective of foreigners, it is not shameful, and they should also feel ashamed when they ask themselves. Looking at the European countries since the last world war, all of them have tried their best to prohibit the export of funds, and even legitimate foreign investment has been temporarily suspended. How can our country sit idly by and let the leakage occur without trying to curb it? This measure also stipulates treatment methods, welcoming conscientious citizens to enthusiastically donate, which not only preserves their personality but also contributes to the country. From the above brief explanation, it can be seen that the bandits and spies want to destroy social order, and the government is doing its best to maintain it. The bandits and spies want our currency to inflate maliciously, and the government has resolutely eliminated inflation. The bandits and spies want to shake and destroy our economy, and the government is establishing a fundamentally stable foundation. In this era of tit-for-tat and active struggle, I sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will recognize the correct direction, unite as one, and move forward together."

### Hong Kong's Financial Market Stabilizes, the Banking Industry Is Optimistic About Our New Measures, Believing That the Official Exchange Rate Can Encourage Overseas Remittances

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] Since the exchange rate between the Gold Yuan and the Hong Kong dollar was determined to be 7.5 Jiao for one Hong Kong dollar, the four major national banks and other major banks here have been handling domestic remittances at this rate on the 23rd. Due to the stable foundation of the Gold Yuan, the exchange rate set by various banks is 74 Gold Yuan for 100 Hong Kong dollars, with the remittance fee excluded. The gold market was quite chaotic for a time after the emergency currency reform, but it has now safely passed. The opening situation in the morning turned better. Observers believe that the official exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the Gold Yuan is an important factor in stabilizing the market. When the market opened this morning, gold was 323 Hong Kong dollars per tael, and then it fluctuated. It rose to 324.5 Hong Kong dollars at noon, but returned to 323 Hong Kong dollars at closing. The U.S. dollar was 5.41 Hong Kong dollars, with only a slight difference of one or two Fen in the rise and fall. The Shanghai and New York exchange rates of local banks and money shops are 4.5 Jiao Hong Kong dollars for 1 million Legal Tender. Although people in the banking and financial industries generally maintain a wait-and-see attitude, they are all optimistic about the results of the new economic measures. It is said that the official exchange rate between the Gold Yuan and the Hong Kong dollar is extremely appropriate and in line with reality. In addition to eliminating speculation in the new currency, it can also encourage overseas remittances and curb the evasion of hot money to Hong Kong. Overseas Chinese in the United States, Southeast Asia, and around the world will directly remit money to the country under favorable exchange rates in the future, without the risk of depreciation.

Editorial

### The New Currency System and Price Controls

Currency is the measure of prices, and at the same time, prices are the measure of currency. Therefore, to stabilize prices, one must first stabilize the value of the currency; and to stabilize the value of the currency, one must simultaneously stabilize prices. This is an immutable principle. This time, the currency reform has adopted many measures to strengthen price controls. Central and local leaders have repeatedly emphasized that prices should be based on those of August 19th, allowing only decreases, not increases, and violators will be severely punished by the Special Criminal Tribunal. People are also very concerned about the future direction of prices, believing that the success or failure of the new currency system can be easily seen in the price levels. This shows the close relationship between prices and the currency system.

In addition to being a medium of exchange, another function of currency is to store value, which manifests itself in the form of people's savings, i.e., the amount of deposits in banks. Therefore, if the new currency system is truly sound, then various deposits will increase in the future, and speculative capital in the market will decrease sharply; and the trend of speculation and hoarding will also change greatly. The Emergency Financial and Economic Measures promulgated this time, in addition to declaring full reserves for open issuance, also have strict regulations regarding the crackdown on speculation and hoarding, and the increase in bank capital; and the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Tianjin have been ordered to temporarily suspend operations, with the intention of diverting speculative capital into the right track to consolidate the value of the new currency and increase people's savings.

The current system adopted is a managed gold standard. Although there are full reserves, it is not allowed to be redeemed. Although the exchange rate with the US dollar is set at four to one, foreign exchange is not open. Therefore, to consolidate the currency value and promote savings, in addition to open issuance, limiting the amount of issuance, minting real subsidiary coins, and striving for a balance of financial revenue and expenditure and international payments, there is indeed nothing else that can be done to strengthen it. However, before the new currency begins to be issued and the old currency redemption has not expired, if the amount of old currency redeemed cannot be offset by the amount of new currency issued, then the actual circulating chips and the degree of speculative capital may exceed that of the past. Also, during the stock exchange closure period, surplus funds will inevitably have one less outlet, and when the gold, silver, and foreign currencies hidden by the people are exchanged in compliance with the order, the state must issue an equivalent amount of new currency for redemption. The amount of such gold, silver, and foreign currencies should be substantial, and the redemption period is limited to the end of September this year. Within this short period of 40 days, how should the huge amount of new currency issued for redemption be absorbed to avoid inflation and maintain the value of the new currency? This issue is really very important. I wonder if the government, in addition to giving out US dollar bonds and allowing deposits in the Central Bank, has prepared other practical and effective countermeasures?

As for prices: The government's specific measures to strengthen control are as follows:

(1) Price Limits: All prices will be frozen at the level of this month's 19th. Any price exceeding this level will be considered a black market and sent to the Special Criminal Tribunal for investigation. In theory, this is very satisfactory. Because prices will not rise from now on, the value of the currency will not fall from now on, the cost of living index can be cancelled from now on, and speculation and hoarding will not be profitable. However, the method of price limits, when applied to a few cities and specific goods in the past, was not very effective. For example, the rice and flour prices in this city have been limited and cancelled repeatedly, and finally allowed to run their natural course. This is not because the authorities did not handle it well, but because the economic situation was too volatile and the people's spirit of abiding by the law was too weak, so there was an inevitability that it was difficult to strictly implement. Now, to implement this price limit universally throughout the country, and to implement it universally on all commodities, how should the execution technology be improved and strengthened? This is indeed worth careful study.

(2) Prohibition of Publishing Black Market Prices: This is very easy to do. But judging from the past gold notes, even if the newspaper does not mention a word, everyone knows the black market price very well, and it has not been completely eradicated. If you really want to curb black market news to avoid stimulating prices, then the technology still seems to need improvement. Especially in Qingdao, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other places, the gold note market is completely open. In many inland provinces, silver dollars are the actual measure and medium of trade, not just a speculative object. Whether this open black market can be eliminated by prohibiting newspapers from publishing it is indeed a question. Otherwise, looking at it so simply may invite the ridicule of burying one's head in the sand.

(3) Inspection of Warehouses: The intention is to prohibit hoarding in order to stabilize prices. This is being gradually promoted in Shanghai. Leaving aside the fact that many warehouses are said to have other reasons and are not suitable for inspection, even if all warehouses are inspected, the goods that exceed the statutory quantity and period will only be confiscated or auctioned. In the short term, the huge amount of confiscated and auctioned goods may have a considerable effect on price stabilization, but after the event, with the reduction of materials, or because the inspection is too strict and the source is blocked, the result of supply falling short of demand may not be able to cause the opposite bad result. Therefore, the actual effect of inspecting warehouses may not be as great as expected.

(4) Strictly Punishing Speculation and Hoarding: Regarding this point, in addition to repeatedly stating it in the Emergency Measures, the President has also strictly ordered all provinces and cities to comply. On the one hand, an Economic Control Committee has been established, and special commissioners have been sent to the three cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou to be responsible for supervision. In the future, strict investigations will be carried out, and the law will be enforced. The trend of hoarding in various places will gradually subside. What is worrying is: (1) The personnel who carry out the investigation and arrest may not all be able to "faithfully abide by the law." In the past, many such cases of using public office for private gain have been discovered. (2) The real big hoarders and speculators often have connections and backgrounds, and they do not worry about not having a suitable name to borrow. Especially those special people who are neither officials nor businessmen, but also officials and businessmen, are well-connected and have all kinds of tricks. If this trend is slightly lenient and cannot be "broken with force," then all control policies may still become a dead letter, and may not be able to achieve the effect of stabilizing prices.

(5) Limiting Salaries and Cancelling the Calculation of Salaries Based on the Cost of Living Index, Limiting the Salaries of All Employees, and Not Allowing Arbitrary Increases: This is naturally also one of the ways to stabilize prices. But we must not forget that salary increases can raise prices, and price increases are also the main reason for increasing salaries. These two are mutually cause and effect.

(6) Selling Materials: When the supply is sufficient, prices will naturally be stable. This method is relatively the most practical. However, when implementing the sale, regardless of whether it is surplus materials, enemy puppet materials, or materials ordered and purchased, one must not focus on profits and openly raise prices, leading to the same mistakes of leading price increases. The various products produced by state-owned enterprises should especially reduce prices and take the lead in promoting price stabilization. The Resources Commission has already telegraphed its subordinate units that the selling price of all products should be based on the local prices on the 19th of this month, converted into gold yuan, and absolutely no increase is allowed. Violators will be dismissed and punished. It is hoped that this ban can be maintained forever.

(7) Reducing Interest Rates: Interest is one of the elements that make up costs. Reducing interest rates is to reduce costs: This will not be a small help in suppressing prices. The Central Bank has already agreed that the daily interbank lending rate of state banks is 0.25%, and the monthly interest rate on loans should not exceed 0.3%. The interest rate on interbank deposits and national bank treasury deposits is 0.2% per month. Commercial banks have also decided that the monthly interest rate on deposits is 0.3%, and the loan interest rate is 1.5%. This is very different from the past market interest rates. However, at this time of transition between the old and the new, whether these interest rates can arouse the interest of general depositors remains to be seen. If deposits do not increase sharply for a while, but loan applications come in droves, can we temporarily stop lending as a reason and reject them all? Now, the activity of various forms of underground money houses does not seem to have weakened, and the phenomenon of commercial firms accepting deposits is even more common. If the legitimate needs of the industrial and commercial circles cannot be met through appropriate channels, I am afraid that reducing interest rates will also be hindered in practice.

Although the above-mentioned methods have both advantages and disadvantages, and may not be enough to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices, our intention in listing the pros and cons is still to urge the authorities to seek improvements in order to exert the role of control, and is by no means passively criticizing, hoping to eliminate the shackles of control. As for the fundamental solution, it is nothing more than developing production and increasing supply in order to naturally suppress prices. This depends on further measures by the authorities, such as improving the industrial environment, reducing production costs, and facilitating transportation and increasing power, etc. On the surface, although it has less to do with the new currency system, in reality, if production cannot be vigorously increased, it will be difficult to suppress prices overnight. Therefore, we believe that it is not enough to just work on the symptoms, and we should start from the big picture and the long term, and strive for a fundamental solution. Premier Weng has also pointed out to the representatives of the financial and industrial circles that adjusting the production, sales, and supply of daily necessities is one of the basic conditions for reforming the currency system. We hope that these basic conditions should be promoted simultaneously and effectively in order to naturally achieve the goal of stabilizing prices.

### Currency Reform Wins Popular Support; People Everywhere Rush to Exchange for Gold Yuan Certificates

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Today is the first day of the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates. According to the telegrams received by this agency from all over the country, the redemption situation is very good. People are enthusiastically taking gold notes and silver dollars to the National Bank for exchange, queuing up and waiting in an orderly manner.

Suzhou [Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 23rd] Gold Yuan Certificates have already been issued. National Banks, Provincial Banks, and branch banks are issuing them and redeeming legal tender. A large batch will continue to be transported on the 24th. Under the strict supervision of the authorities, prices are trending downwards. The rice market opened with coarse japonica at 17.3 yuan and white japonica at 19.5 yuan. Because vegetable vendors were ignorantly raising prices for profit, the prices in the vegetable market were chaotic. The police bureau decided to send police officers to be stationed there to monitor and correct prices at any time. Many retail stores were also privately marking up prices on the Shanghai product standard. After the police bureau sent police officers to investigate house by house by district, dozens of stores were found. In addition to ordering the prices to be corrected on the spot, the persons in charge of the stores were taken to the bureau for investigation. The merchants were shaken and voluntarily restored the original prices of August 19th.

Wuxi [Our Correspondent in Wuxi, 23rd] After the Gold Yuan Certificates were issued, both bulls and bears adopted a cautious approach. Transactions were rare, and prices were uniformly downwards.

Top-grade white rice was 19.67 yuan, wheat 17.1 yuan, special-grade flour 7.25 yuan. Jiufeng yarn fell sharply, all trading at 520 yuan. Because coal was raised in price, the police bureau is summoning the person in charge for questioning.

Zhenjiang [Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 23rd] Gold Yuan Certificates began to be issued here today. Many citizens held gold and silver coins and lined up in front of the Central Bank, vying to exchange them for Gold Yuan Certificates.

The market price of rice is 21 yuan, secondary rice 19 yuan, soybean oil 7.5 yuan per 10 catties, Green Jinshan flour 7.4 yuan per bag, and other prices are generally stable.

Nantong [Our Correspondent in Nantong, 23rd] Gold Yuan Certificates have not yet been transported here. On the 23rd, the market still traded with legal tender.

Various banks were still able to cope with the redemption of banknotes that flooded the market. In order to maintain the market price of goods at the standard of the 19th, the provincial capital police bureau dispatched police to supervise the implementation. Cotton yarn, silk, and rice were slightly lower than on the 19th. Some door-to-door shops took the opportunity to raise prices. The vegetable market uniformly raised prices, jumping by 25% or more. The price of rickshaws also rose, and citizens complained. The black market for gold and silver has disappeared.

[Another Telegram] The Hangzhou City Government, in order to avoid possible disputes over employee wages after the implementation of the currency reform, established a labor-management dispute arbitration committee on the 23rd. The wages of employees in all industries will be converted to Gold Yuan based on the earnings of the 19th. If there is too much, it will be appropriately reduced. It was also decided to establish a price review committee on the 24th to convene labor and employees to discuss prices such as haircuts.

Xuzhou [Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 23rd] The Gold Yuan Certificates began to be issued and circulated in the market. The public was excited.

Nanchang [Our Correspondent in Nanchang, 23rd] New currency was issued simultaneously in Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Jian, Jiangxi Province, on the 23rd.

Late-season rice was 14.65 yuan, 20-count Lushan yarn was 673.33 yuan, Longtou fine cloth was 29 yuan, crude oil was 38 yuan, and cigarettes generally fell by 30%. The market prices of various goods have not yet fallen back to the original prices of the 19th. Sugar and native paper are expected to rise. Because subsidiary coins have not yet been issued, it is difficult to make change. It is rumored that the salt market will increase taxes, and it was once closed. Now, there are inferior salts on the market, and there is still a black market for large-scale transactions.

Chengdu [Our Correspondent in Chengdu, 23rd] The market in Chengdu responded well to the issuance of the new currency. In general, prices are quite stable, except for daily necessities and door-to-door prices, which have jumped wildly.

### Tension in Changsha; Unscrupulous Merchants Rush to Buy Silver Dollars

[Our Correspondent in Changsha, 23rd] Gold Yuan Certificates have been issued, and banks and money houses have resumed business. People in Changsha are nervous and looking forward to the unfolding of this new era with historical significance. A small number of unscrupulous merchants do not understand the meaning of currency reform and are actually buying large amounts of silver dollars for hoarding, causing silver dollar prices to rise to 6.4 million legal tender per dollar, exceeding the statutory 400,000. Bank interest rates are 6 yuan per 1,000 yuan per day, and money house interest rates are 20 yuan per 1,000 yuan per day, with compound interest charged externally. Every 100 yuan of Gold Yuan Certificates can earn 60 yuan in interest, plus compound interest that is turned over every five days, which is nearly 80 yuan. Commentators believe that those who hold this view should be killed.

### Banks in Beiping Busy All Day with Silver Dollar Exchanges; Overcrowded with Gold Yuan Certificate Exchanges; Central Bank Window Broken by the Crowd

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 23rd] Banks in Beiping were busy all day on the 23rd. The National Bank was unprecedentedly crowded. There were surprisingly many people exchanging gold and silver for Gold Yuan Certificates, especially silver dollars. The window was broken by the crowd, and a tragedy almost occurred. However, there was no entire bar of gold, and silver dollars were mostly in denominations of 30 or 20 yuan. Fewer people exchanged US dollars. There were more places to exchange legal tender for Gold Yuan, so the order was better. The market stagnation of the past three days has made the banks extremely busy. Police and military police maintained order with guns. Few people inquired about silver dollars in the market. Occasionally, transactions were made at 5.9 million, which was due to small citizens who were unable to withstand the crowded exchange and urgently needed cash. Prices were weak, and many people were still watching. Boat flour was 8 yuan, a drop of 0.3 yuan. The rest of the transactions were sparse. Cotton cloth has not yet opened. Few shops have changed to mark prices in Gold Yuan. The official supervision is very strict, and prices have not moved.

Tianjin [Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 23rd] Gold Yuan Certificates appeared on the streets of Tianjin on the 23rd. Prices have generally fallen, and the people's mood is very excited. What is especially unexpected is that those who took gold notes to the Central Bank for exchange were unexpectedly crowded, and a long line formed in front of the door in order. By the time the Central Bank closed in the afternoon, they had not been able to complete the exchange. The situation was the same in the afternoon.

[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 23rd] All markets in Tianjin resumed trading on the 23rd. Prices fell uniformly. Battleship flour was 8.4 yuan, Hong Wufu cloth was 26.5 yuan, and 20-count Sanding yarn was 590 yuan.

Guihua [Our Correspondent in Guihua, 23rd] Prices in Guihua City are stable, and the market is still very stable. The Central Bank branch began exchanging Gold Yuan Certificates on the 23rd.

Zhangyuan [Our Correspondent in Zhangjiakou, 23rd] Today, new banknotes were exchanged and issued. The front of the Central Bank in Zhangjiakou was crowded.

Jinan [Our Correspondent in Jinan, 23rd] Gold Yuan Certificates were officially issued. All markets resumed trading. 20-count yarn immediately fell by 300 million legal tender, which is 600 Gold Yuan Certificates. It then fell to 580 yuan and recovered to 600 yuan in the afternoon. Top-grade flour also fell by 2 million legal tender, which is 9 yuan per bag of Gold Yuan Certificates. Gold jewelry was bought at 200 yuan and sold at 230 yuan. Today, except for lump coal, which rose to 136.5 yuan per ton due to a shortage of sources, the market was generally weak. According to investigation, the reason for this is that the money supply is still tight due to the currency reform, and the prices in other places have fallen uniformly. Governor Wang Yaowu of Shandong specially convened a meeting of the heads of various banks and money houses on the 23rd and gave instructions on the matters that should be paid attention to after the issuance of the new currency.

Qingdao [Our Correspondent in Qingdao, 23rd] The Qingdao City Government urgently ordered the closure of nine illegal money houses, including Tongjusheng, on the morning of the 23rd. The Central Bank received the most gold notes and silver dollars in exchange for new banknotes, while few people exchanged legal tender, which shows that the general public did not have legal tender on hand. The legal tender of various banks and money houses was mostly exchanged by the Central Bank in one day on the 23rd.

Lanzhou [Our Correspondent in Lanzhou, 23rd] After gold notes were officially circulated, people were extremely crowded when they went to exchange legal tender. Because general commercial loans were suspended, the market was in a general downturn. Except for food, which was particularly stable, piece goods, cigarettes, foreign goods, and sundries all fell uniformly.

Xi'an [Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 23rd] The National Bank here has issued Gold Yuan Certificates with denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 50 yuan today. Citizens are enthusiastically taking gold bars and silver dollars to the Central Bank to exchange for new banknotes. The situation is enthusiastic, which is rarely seen in previous redemptions.

### Twenty-Five Years of Solitary Compilation: "History of Chinese Economy" Completed; 82-Year-Old Huang Jifei Creates a Miracle

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd] The lengthy "History of Chinese Economy," a rare masterpiece in the history of Chinese scholarship, has recently been completed by the 82-year-old Mr. Huang Jifei (Xu Yuan). The book took 25 years to compile, and work never stopped, regardless of cold or heat. In order to collect materials, the author buried himself in the National Peking Library for 12 years, and then engaged in reference work in the Nanjing and Chongqing Central Libraries for many years. In 1940, with the support of President Chiang Kai-shek, he took the abundant materials and first draft back to his native Jiangxi from the wartime capital, secluded himself in the mountains, and devoted himself to organizing the work. He has not set foot in cities for many years, and recently completed the entire work, hiring many people to transcribe and prepare it for publication. The book's content goes back to the Zhou and Qin dynasties and extends to recent times, and all historical materials related to economic theories have been collected without omission. It is the most complete reference book for those studying economic history. This kind of masterpiece should have been compiled by a special committee established by the state, but it has now been completed by one person, which is truly an academic miracle.

### Kremlin Conducts Final Negotiations Yesterday; Stalin Participates in Meeting; Agreement on German Issue Expected

[Our Newspaper Reports] London, 23rd, Moscow report: The British, American, and French ambassadors held a meeting at the French Embassy on the morning of the 23rd. It is reported that the differences between France and Britain and the United States have been eliminated in the exchange of notes over the weekend, leading to a general sense of optimism. This optimism is growing as the decisive meeting in the Kremlin approaches. It is expected that the three ambassadors will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in the afternoon or evening, and it is said that Stalin will also be present at that time. According to reliable sources, French Ambassador Chatelau has received new instructions from Paris. According to well-informed French sources, the British, American, and French ambassadors will meet with Stalin in the Kremlin on Monday evening. The meeting is expected to begin at 8:00 PM (standard time).

[Our Newspaper Reports] Well-informed observers predict that the Kremlin meeting will reach some agreements, which is why Stalin is willing to attend the meeting. If an agreement is reached, it will be announced simultaneously in the four national capitals.

[United Press, London, 23rd] The "Three-Person Emergency Committee" composed of British Undersecretary of State Strang, U.S. Ambassador Douglas, and French Ambassador Massigli met this morning at the British Foreign Office. It is reported that the topic of the meeting was to discuss the next steps of the three countries regarding the Kremlin talks.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Diplomatic sources said on the 23rd that the four-power Moscow Conference has reached a decisive stage, but the outcome is still uncertain. If no unexpected new obstacles arise at the last minute, the world may know the outcome of the long-term secret negotiations before the weekend. Officials unanimously believe that neither optimism nor pessimism is appropriate at this time. It is said that the negotiations have reached a stage that can determine the survival of the "Cold War." The discussions among Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have focused primarily on the Berlin land blockade, which has now entered its fourth week, and may also be its last week. The British, American, and French ambassadors met for two hours on the 22nd. It is understood that they are ready to begin their sixth and final meeting with Molotov. Nothing has been heard here about the progress of these important negotiations. The State Department has remained tight-lipped, except to acknowledge that Moscow exists in the world and that negotiations on Germany are taking place there. However, reliable sources have revealed the following broad characteristics of the meeting: The Berlin blockade remains the most important issue, and secondary attention is focused on other German issues and the possibility of convening a four-foreign minister conference. Britain, the United States, and France are taking a united front in dealing with Soviet demands. Rumors of discord among the three powers last week are not believed here. The four powers will not begin dealing with a German peace treaty because of the Moscow talks, unless the Western countries believe that continued efforts will lead to success. It is understood that the West believes that raising the matter again would only mislead the world about the prospects for peace.

### Detained U.S. Military Government Official Released by Soviet Side; Simultaneously, German Police Officer in Soviet Zone Also Released

[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] Soviet authorities released Hidden, director of the intelligence bureau of the U.S. military government in Berlin, on the 23rd. The Western countries immediately released Andermann, a German police chief in the Soviet zone, without interrogation. Hidden was arrested by Soviet military police while taking pictures at the Potsdamer Platz yesterday afternoon. He was released shortly after noon on the 23rd and returned to the Roosevelt barracks of the U.S. military police at 1:25 PM. In response to inquiries, he said that the Soviets "treated me well. They locked me in a small, shabby room and even asked me to sweep the floor this morning. They gave me two meals, but I don't want to criticize what kind of food it was." When the Soviets questioned Hidden, they focused on his motives for taking pictures and did not seem very interested in his position.

As for Andermann, he was arrested in the British-occupied zone yesterday in retaliation for the kidnapping of several police officers in the western zone. British authorities said that Andermann may be tried by a German court, but since Hidden has been released, the West will send Andermann back. At the same time, British and American authorities are increasing patrols at Potsdamer Platz to prevent further kidnappings. The Americans have nicknamed the square "Kidnapping Corner." Traffic in the area has almost come to a standstill due to tensions between the East and West. Black market merchants have disappeared from the area.

### Human Rights Commission Approves Amendment to Press Convention; Case to be Submitted to UN General Assembly for Approval

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 22nd, United Press] According to the U.S. representative, the freedom of the press convention passed by the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council has weakened the content of the original document drafted by the United Nations conference attended by more than 50 countries. The original document was related to the collection of news and its dissemination internationally. After a day-long dispute over procedural issues, 16 countries participated in the vote, with nine in favor: the United States, Britain, China, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Peru, Turkey, and Venezuela; three against: the Soviet Union, Poland, and Byelorussia; and four abstentions: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Lebanon. Due to the East-West stalemate, the Human Rights Commission must submit the amendment to the Press Convention to the United Nations General Assembly to be convened in Paris. Earlier, due to Soviet opposition, the Human Rights Commission's consideration of the first convention was delayed for two weeks. Furthermore, it was unable to consider the amendments that had been passed but were still subject to much controversy. The U.S. representative also said that because of the decision not to make further recommendations, the chances of the General Assembly approving the convention have decreased.

### Rumor: 2,000 Armed Chinese Gather on Siamese-Malayan Border; British Troops Supporting Siam to Quell Rebellion Drive North

[United Press, Singapore, 22nd] According to reliable sources on the 22nd, armed Chinese have concentrated within Thailand, five to ten miles from the Thai-Malayan border. Senior government officials and New Kota police authorities declined to comment, but believe that if the information is true, Kelantan will face a serious threat. Observers pointed out that these troops may be communists who have infiltrated Thailand from China. However, according to well-informed sources, it is more likely that they are former Malayan terrorists who fled to Thailand and are now trying to return. The number of people in their ranks is currently impossible to estimate, but it is rumored that each team has about 40 to 50 people.

[Agence France-Presse, Singapore, 22nd] According to reports from Bachok, five groups of armed Overseas Chinese, each with about 400 people, have concentrated on the Siamese border, preparing to invade Malaya from Kelantan. Senior military and police authorities in Bachok refused to confirm the information, saying only that Kelantan was prepared to resist any threat.

[Agence France-Presse, Rangoon, 22nd] According to well-informed sources here, if Siam has only its weak air force in peacetime, the country will fall into the hands of traitors. Currently, a huge new threat has emerged, known as the "Cats of the Forest," who are motley thugs who do not obey anyone and specialize in robbing and raping defenseless villagers. They are now the authority of the day, strictly enforcing orders. Neither the government nor the rebels know how to deal with this new factor. Many have fled due to the government's suppression of the rebellion, so its forces are weak and have no time or strength to eliminate the "Cats of the Forest," some of whom are young women who can ride long distances every day. The defection of a part of the White Army has resulted in weapons falling into the hands of these robbers.

The most recent development is that British troops have driven straight south from the north to assist the government in attacking the rebels.

He said, "Iran reserves the right to formally protest any future acts that infringe on the sovereignty of the oil fields."

### Purges Intensified in South Yugoslavia; Large Numbers of Anti-Tito Elements Arrested

[United Press, Belgrade, 22nd] According to reliable sources, hundreds of Yugoslav personnel, including 50 secret police officers, have been arrested within ten days in a purge of suspected supporters of the Communist Information Bureau and opponents of Marshal Tito. The Communist Information Bureau has repeatedly criticized Tito as an enemy of international communism. The Yugoslav Communist Party has also declared its loyalty to Tito, while at the same time emphasizing their loyalty to Soviet Premier Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party.

The recent purges began on August 4 with the arrest of four officials of the Montenegrin Provincial Government, including Zizi, who is known to be pro-Soviet. Vukovic, the vice president of the province, was also arrested. In addition, Kosovo, a former South Yugoslav press officer at the United Nations and editor of the country's official news agency, and Lakovic, a law doctorate and pre-war communist leader in the province, were also reportedly arrested. The purges apparently did not affect province president Blažo Jovanović, the brother of the former chief of staff, General Vukomanovic, who was recently shot and killed. According to reliable sources, on the same day that Vuković fled and was shot, Major General Popivoda and another unnamed general also fled by plane to an undisclosed destination on the 18th.

"Truman is clearly panicked by the support the Progressive Party has gained from tens of thousands of Republicans, Democrats, and independents."

### Soviet Consul General Lomakin's Mysterious Disappearance; Once Appeared on Long Island, New York

[Agence France-Presse, New York, August 22] The disappearance of Soviet Consul General to New York, Lomakin, became a hot topic for the press here on the 22nd. It is reported that since Lomakin left the Soviet Consulate with four people on the afternoon of the 21st, looking worried, no one has known his whereabouts. The press here speculates that his disappearance is related to the departure of three Soviet diplomats from the United States on the evening of the 23rd, who are taking a route through Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, back to Moscow. However, the mystery of this mysterious disappearance will eventually be solved, because a car belonging to the Soviet diplomatic representative in the United States was stopped by a police officer in Glen Cove, Long Island, New York, for speeding, and Lomakin was surprisingly found inside the car.

### Global Christian Conference Opens in the Netherlands; 3,000 People Participate in Prayer Service

[Central News Agency, Amsterdam, August 22, United Press] The World Council of Churches Assembly held its opening prayer service today at the New Amsterdam Church here. Church leaders from all over the world marched into the church in procession at 3 p.m. A total of 3,000 people participated in the prayer, making this the largest gathering of Christian churches from around the world in history. Although countries behind the Iron Curtain, such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other Eastern European countries, had representatives present, the Greek Church of the Soviet Union had no representative.

Among the representatives from various countries, the most notable was German pastor Niemöller, who was famous for opposing Hitler. The purpose of this meeting is to organize the World Council of Churches and make it a permanent global cooperation organization. Dr. Mott Mortimer, one of the leaders of the church unity movement, delivered the opening speech, briefly outlining the history of the church unity movement and expressing his deep belief that the church should address various unresolved issues. The number of issues currently pending is unprecedented in history.

### Palestinian-Jewish Dispute to Be Submitted to UN General Assembly for Discussion; Bernadotte Decides to Abandon Mediation

[United Press International, Stockholm, August 22] United Nations Mediator Count Bernadotte said here on the 22nd that he had abandoned his attempts to peacefully resolve the Palestinian issue, at least until the United Nations General Assembly discusses the matter. He said that attempting to arrange peace talks again would be futile for the time being, as the two sides seem to have no common ground for a possible agreement. Bernadotte came here to attend the International Red Cross Conference, of which he is chairman, but he will return to the Middle East for another round of talks with Arab and Jewish leaders. He will then draft a detailed report on Palestine to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly to be convened in Paris next month.

Bernadotte will also complete a detailed report on the situation in Jerusalem, with recommendations on the future status of the city. The Holy City has been a point of contention between the Arabs and Jews and may be the most difficult issue in the Holy Land dispute. Observers say that the UN General Assembly will decide how to resolve the Palestinian issue. Bernadotte believes that the Arab and Jewish sides will accept the solution passed by the majority of the world's countries. It is generally believed that any solution must be accompanied by sanctions and threats, and the Arab and Jewish sides should be forced under world pressure.

### The Spiritual Leaders of Blacks and Jews Protest the "Era of Terror"; Prelude to the US November Election, Part 5

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing

When Wallace's Progressive Party was first established, the China Revolutionary Committee and the Democratic League, which were in exile in Hong Kong, both sent telegrams to congratulate Wallace. In the United States, according to rough estimates by The New York Times, the Progressive Party may receive more than three million votes in the November election this year, roughly the same as the Progressive Party of Theodore Roosevelt's time in 1912. Wallace's strong supporters are mostly young people, women, laborers, or veterans. At the Progressive Party's founding convention in Philadelphia, there were about 2,000 delegates and as many as 8,000 attendees. Among the delegates, women accounted for 30%, those under 40 accounted for 60%, union members accounted for 35%, and veterans accounted for 20%.

The scene was chaotic, more chaotic than the Republican and Democratic parties. Most resolutions were passed amidst shouts and clamor. In addition to the above four groups, blacks and Jews were very prominent in the party. The opening speech was given by Howard, a black lawyer from Iowa (Wallace's hometown). Howard initially spoke about humanity's need for peace and that only Wallace could save peace in the United States. He said that after the Progressive Party is elected, it is prepared to build eight million houses to alleviate America's serious housing shortage. The Progressive Party advocates for the nationalization of large industries and stipulates a minimum wage for workers of one dollar per hour. He said that the Progressive Party advocates for equal employment and the abolition of racial discrimination. He said, "Since I have followed Mr. Wallace, I have enjoyed equal treatment that I have never had before... In the past, the Republican and Democratic parties also talked about abolishing racial discrimination, but they are still full of white supremacy, especially in several southern states, which is especially severe." Howard spoke vigorously, and many whites and blacks applauded in the audience.

Jews are also considered an oppressed "minority" in the United States. Many Jewish-American citizens have now become followers of Wallace. Isaacson, a Jewish member of Congress, was one of the most prominent representatives at this Wallace party convention. Some say that Isaacson's speech this time will win at least hundreds of thousands of votes for Wallace, which seems very likely. This Isaacson is a member of the House of Representatives elected from the 24th district of New York. He recently returned from an inspection of Palestine and said that the Truman administration is carrying out a new conspiracy against the Jewish state with Britain, preparing to gradually blockade the newly established Jewish state. The Truman administration despises Jews, and their current hypocritical performance is entirely to cope with the November election and win votes. Once the election is over, they are prepared to declare that the Jewish state (the State of Israel) is protected by Britain and the United States. Britain will still obtain the port of "Israel" as their military base, sell Jerusalem to Abduallah, the Muslim king of Outer Jordan, and strictly limit Jewish immigration. In this way, it would be tantamount to making the Jewish state an appendage of the Kingdom of Outer Jordan, while also returning to a part of the "British Empire." He said that the results of decades of struggle by the Jews will be destroyed by the Truman administration, "because these politicians in the Republican and Democratic parties still harbor deep-rooted racial prejudices and discriminate against Jews!"

Isaacson explained that everything he saw during this inspection was correct. He said that if President Truman wanted to "deny" these facts, he would be willing to accompany the president on another trip to see. He said, "Despite the fact that you capitalists, for the sake of the interests of Middle Eastern and Near Eastern oil fields, are making plans that violate the survival rights of the Jewish people, the Jewish people will not be conquered." He said, "For decades, Hitler's barbarity and the British Empire's cruelty have failed to exterminate the Jews. On the contrary, like a towering giant, the new Jewish state is still reborn!" Isaacson called on Jewish-American citizens to unite and support Wallace and the Progressive Party!

In the Progressive Party's manifesto, it also specifically emphasized protecting the rights and interests of Jews and blacks, abolishing all restrictions on "human rights," opposing the "poll tax" in the South, strictly prohibiting lynching murders, and abolishing racial discrimination. In the foreign policy platform, it also clearly stipulated full support for the newly established "Jewish state" and immediately granting the Jewish state a large loan.

Wallace can become the spiritual leader of black and Jewish Americans today, which may be something he never dreamed of. In fact, if you trace the roots, there is also a consistent thread. Wallace was originally the so-called left wing of the Democratic Party in the era of Roosevelt's consolidation of power. He advocated being close to the Soviet Union, advocating state-owned industry, and advocating socialism. This is in stark contrast to the traditional American democratic spirit and the traditional spirit of "free enterprise and free competition." Wallace is determined to break the "status quo." Therefore, all Americans who are dissatisfied with the status quo naturally gather around Wallace, which is also a natural phenomenon. Wallace's political program and policies are like a general store. Anything that is considered unsatisfactory in today's American governance is recorded and becomes the Progressive Party's political program for reform. To express it in a Chinese idiom, it is called "singing the opposite tune." Wallace's newsreels are cheered and applauded by many people in theaters, which is why!

For example, the US immigration law, especially the immigration law specifically for Asians, is something our Chinese people have always been dissatisfied with. But the Republican or Democratic parties have never mentioned in their political programs and policies improving the harsh rules for Chinese immigrants. Only this Wallace's Progressive Party specifically mentioned it. In the Progressive Party's manifesto, it also advocates for national health insurance, advocates for food rationing, abolishes labor laws that restrict the interests of workers, nationalizes heavy industry, overthrows trusts, and also mentions that the Constitution guarantees the Communist Party's freedom of activity, and advocates for abolishing the special investigation and statistics committees in Congress.

At this very time, President Truman broke historical precedent and convened a special session of Congress. Due to the confession of Bentley, a female spy of the Comintern, a so-called espionage case that shocked the world broke out. The US Congress's Special Investigation Committee (originally translated as the Committee for Investigating Those Disloyal to the United States) is not only not despised by Wallace, but also has power beyond the sky and is exerting a rare power in the American administrative system. Ms. Bentley, in the investigation court of the Congressional Special Committee, identified Wallace's right-hand men—Pan Lu and Coler—as Soviet spies. Pan Lu was promoted by Wallace in the past and served in the War Production Board. He is now Wallace's campaign aide. Bentley said that he had stolen statistics from the War Production Board and reported them to Moscow. Bentley also said that the great political commentator Lippmann used to have a personal female secretary who was also a communist. Bentley and this female communist had stolen Lippmann's confidential information. This female communist is now the secretary-general of Wallace's Progressive Party state party department in South Carolina. Chambers, an editor of the American magazine Time, also rushed to the Washington Congressional Investigation Committee to testify after hearing Bentley's "confession." Chambers used to be a communist and withdrew a long time ago. Chambers said that one of Wallace's key cadres, Plesman, and his wife, Sophia, are 100% communists. Plesman used to be the secretary of the American Federation of Labor. He quit his secretary job with a $19,000 annual salary to work as Wallace's campaign aide. When the Progressive Party held its founding convention in Philadelphia, Plesman was the secretary of the declaration drafting committee, and his wife, Sophia, was the person in charge of helping Wallace in the women's sector.

A few days ago, American national secret detectives broke into Wallace's "central party headquarters" at 39 Park Avenue in New York, ransacked the place, and conducted a major search. This angered the 60-year-old "great thinker." Wallace has made several speeches in a row these days. He said that the Congress controlled by the Republican Party is creating an "era of terror" that is unprecedented in history. The American people should unite to protest the "atrocities" of the Republican Congress! "To protect the dignity of the American Constitution and to fight for the right to personal freedom, we must protest the Republican Congress!"

Wallace's protests have had no response. On the contrary, the espionage case is becoming more and more extensive, even to the point that Molotov was "furious" in Moscow, and Ambassador Pan Youxin rushed to the US State Department at six o'clock in the morning to protest. US-Soviet relations are moving on the edge of a cliff. What impression will this give millions of American voters of the "Progressive Party" that advocates for Wallace to be close to the Soviet Union and the Communist Party?

### Focus of Chinese and Foreign Attention, Packed Audience; Public Trial of Defeated General Okamura for the First Time; Cunning Confessions Attempt to Shirk Responsibility; Lawyers and Prosecutors Engage in Heated Debate; Court Orders Postponement for Retrial

[Report from This Newspaper] Okamura Yasuji, the top Japanese war criminal who served as the commander-in-chief of the China Expeditionary Army during the war, was publicly tried by the military court in the City Council Hall yesterday. More than 700 leaders from Chinese and foreign circles and others attended the packed audience. From 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 6:30 PM, in addition to interrogating Okamura Yasuji and summoning four Japanese division and brigade commanders, including Ochiai Kyūkurō, who had already been convicted, the prosecutors and defense lawyers engaged in fierce debates from their respective standpoints. Because this case is one of the most important since the trial of war criminals, the court declared a postponement of the trial for special solemnity so that it could be studied in detail and achieve fairness. The date of the retrial will be publicly announced separately after it is decided.

At around 8 o'clock yesterday morning, Okamura Yasuji and witnesses Ochiai Kyūkurō, commander of the 27th Division, Hishida Genshirō, commander of the 116th Division, Nashioka Hisao, commander of the 55th Brigade, and Funabiki Masayuki, commander of the Changsha Garrison, were escorted to the court by members of the military court from the war criminal prison. Police and security guards lined up at the gate of the City Council and in the courtroom on the third floor, with strict security. The court session opened on time at 9:30, with Judge Shi Meiyu presiding. Judges Lu Qi, Zhang Tikun, Ye Zaizeng, Lin Jianpeng, Prosecutor Shi Yong (responsible for the indictment portion in the morning), Chief Prosecutor Wang Jiamei (responsible for the debate portion in the afternoon), Clerk Ding Xiang'an, Interpreters Wang Renming, Huang Wenzheng, Luo Di, Defense Lawyers Jiang Yiping, Yang Peng, and Qian Longsheng. Okamura Yasuji was first brought forward, wearing a military casual uniform with a turned-down collar and a white shirt. He was in better spirits than during the last investigation court. After the court investigated his age, place of origin, and resume, Okamura was allowed to sit down, and the prosecutor read the indictment. After reading, Judge Shi began to ask questions, and Okamura calmly replied. To the point that the court asked whether Doihara was the mastermind of launching the invasion of China, he replied that he did not know because he was serving in the Personnel Section of the Army Ministry at the time, and he did not participate in the launch of the war of aggression against China or the Greater East Asia Policy. He claimed that this was probably the idea of ​​the young officers, and that he himself was a predecessor of the young officers. From the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident until the Japanese army invaded Nanjing, he was always the commander of the 2nd Division in Harbin, and he was not transferred to participate until the Battle of Wuhan, when he was appointed commander of the 11th Army, commanding four divisions. At the time of the Pearl Harbor Incident, he was transferred to Beiping as the commander of the North China Area Army. On November 26, 1944, he was ordered to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the Expeditionary Army, and he took over on December 2 until the surrender. During these eight months, his mission was to prevent the US military from landing on the east coast and to concentrate the troops in the Xianggan inland in Jinghu, so there were no large-scale battles in China. At that time, the Japanese army, except for those in Northeast China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, was under his jurisdiction. He did not know about the crimes committed by the 23rd Army under Lieutenant General Tanaka Hisaichi when it burned the city of Liuzhou when it retreated from Guizhou and Guangxi, and the massacre of civilians by the 27th Division commander Ochiai Kyūkurō and others. After taking office as commander-in-chief, he ordered his subordinates to prevent criminal acts. He expressed his deep apology on behalf of the Japanese people to the Chinese who had been harmed, but he did not admit that he should be held responsible as an accomplice, because the division commander had a corps commander and an area army commander above him before reaching the commander-in-chief.

Summoning Witnesses, Funabiki Masayuki Defends Himself

At this point, the court summoned witnesses Ochiai Kyūkurō, Hishida Genshirō, and Funabiki Masayuki (the above three were sentenced to life imprisonment for condoning their subordinates' massacres and robberies), and Nashioka Hisao (sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for destroying property and looting). Among them, Funabiki Masayuki requested to speak, and the court agreed. Funabiki Masayuki took out a pre-written long article from his arms and read it aloud, meaning that Okamura had instructed him to strictly enforce military discipline and that printed materials with the instruction "Thoroughly Love the People" were distributed to the army and read aloud in the morning and evening. Okamura also amended the military law, stipulating that rape was not subject to prosecution unless there was a complaint, and that the offender would be sentenced to death. All of this can prove that Okamura should not be held responsible as an accomplice. Funabiki Masayuki then defended himself against the crime for which he had been sentenced. The court stopped him because he had been speaking for too long and asked him to pause and speak again in the afternoon.

Situation After Japan's Surrender

So we continued to ask Okamura Yasuji about the situation after Japan's surrender. Okamura claimed that at that time, there were about one million Japanese troops in China. After the surrender, there was no act of disobeying the order, but they fought with the New Fourth Army, with more than 10,000 casualties, because the New Fourth Army intended to disarm them. He ordered that no weapons should be handed over to other troops except the Central Army. In addition, at the time of surrender, there was a unit of unknown number that intended to take over Nanjing. In order to maintain law and order, he also opened fire on them. He reported these two matters to the Chinese military authorities, who believed that the disposal was very appropriate. After that, he served as the director of the Japanese officers and soldiers' post-war liaison class, handling the repatriation and retention of personnel. He has suffered from lung disease since last October and has not recovered to this day.

Presiding Judge Asks About Impressions of China

Judge Shi then asked what his thoughts were on the Japanese militarists' policy of invading the world, and what his personal impressions of China were? Okamura said: Regarding the invasion of China, he fundamentally disagreed with it when he was young, but because soldiers took obedience as their duty, he had to come by order of the headquarters. The stability of East Asia must depend on the prosperity of China, so after the surrender, he ordered his subordinates to do their best to assist the Chinese government.

When the court convened in the afternoon, Funabiki Masayuki continued to defend his own crimes. After the conclusion, the court allowed the defendant's defense lawyer Jiang Yiping to directly ask the witnesses about the organization of the Japanese army and the issue of military discipline responsibility. The conclusion was that the commander-in-chief was responsible for strategic deployment, and the military discipline of each division was the responsibility of the regimental commander, battalion commander, and company commander, who were responsible at different levels, and the division commander was responsible for the overall result. The commander-in-chief can transfer the division commander but has no right to dismiss the division commander.

### Prosecutor Lists Five Arguments; Defendant Failed to Prevent or Stop War Crimes

The debate then began, starting with a statement by Chief Prosecutor Wang Jiamei. He listed five arguments: (1) The reasons stated in the indictment, the defendant did not prevent his subordinates from carrying out massacres, robberies, and destruction of property everywhere, and he did not promptly stop them afterward. According to Article 9 of the Regulations on the Trial of War Criminals, he should be held responsible as an accomplice. (2) The wording of Article 9 is "Those who are in a position of supervision and guidance and fail to prevent or stop war crimes to the best of their ability shall be considered as accomplices." The defendant was the commander-in-chief of the Expeditionary Army and was naturally in a position of supervision and guidance. Since the War of Resistance, the crimes of the Japanese army are too numerous to mention. The defendant should have known about them. Although he said that he had ordered prevention after taking office as commander-in-chief, there were still crimes in fact, which shows that he did not do his best. (3) The defendant's reply stated that he was only responsible for national strategy, but the strategy he implemented was a war of aggression. The starting point was wrong, and the defendant, after taking office as commander-in-chief, still frantically attacked Guizhou and Guangxi, opened up the Yuehan South Road, and disturbed southern Henan and northern Hubei. He should be held responsible for the crime of destroying peace. (4) The trial of war criminals is not an act of emotion, nor is it to retaliate against the Japanese army or individuals, but to punish the invading country so that there will be no more wars of aggression and to safeguard world peace. (5) The court's prosecution of the defendant only selected the crimes of his subordinates that were obvious and had solid evidence. In fact, the defendant had fought in China before serving as commander-in-chief. How could his crime be limited to this? However, the defendant assisted our government in receiving the army at the time of surrender and made a slight contribution to our country's situation. Therefore, it is hoped that the judge will measure the crime and impose a punishment to balance it.

### Defense Attorney Refutes Two Points; Requests Court to Acquit

Defense attorney Jiang Yiping was the first to refute the prosecutor's arguments, specifically analyzing the terms "in a position of command and supervision" and "failed to do their utmost" in Article 9 of the War Crimes Trial Regulations upon which the indictment was based. He argued: (1) Although the defendant was the commander-in-chief, his command could reach distant locations, but supervision should be the responsibility of each level, only reaching the soldiers through officers at each level. (2) Even if the defendant had both responsibilities, it should be judged whether he had done his utmost to prevent and stop the crimes. According to witnesses, the defendant had warned his subordinates not to disturb the people, issued slogans of "no killing, no burning, no offense," printed proclamations of love for the people and issued orders to the army to obey them, and abolished the requirement of a victim's accusation for rape cases to increase the severity of the punishment. All of these showed that the defendant had done his utmost to prevent crimes. May I ask, as the commander-in-chief issuing orders, what other methods could the defendant use to perform his duties besides verbal and written instructions? Therefore, the defendant has indeed done his utmost, and he should not be held responsible for the results. (3) The trial of criminals should focus on evidence. The defendant should not be convicted simply because he was a commander-in-chief. The young officers who launched the invasion of China are still avoiding the law, but the principal culprits are not caught, and the defendant is being prosecuted simply because he was the commander-in-chief. This would not only make the real culprits laugh, but also cause the dignity of the law to be lost. Now that the defendant has presented various counter-evidences, for the sake of the world's morality, international opinion, and the maintenance of peace, please, your honor, declare the defendant not guilty.

The other two defense attorneys, Qian Longsheng and Yang Peng, also defended the defendant successively. Attorney Qian believed that the defendant only bore strategic responsibility, that command belonged to the General Headquarters, and that supervision should be the responsibility of the Minister of the Army. The various crimes committed by the Japanese army, such as massacres, were all accidental rather than planned, and the defendant could not prevent accidental events. Attorney Yang discussed the policy of trying war criminals and also asked the court to declare the defendant not guilty.

### Whether Utmost Effort Was Made Is the Focus of Debate

The prosecutor and attorney Jiang Yiping debated again. The prosecutor said: The so-called "doing one's utmost" has varying degrees. If the defendant could truly implement military orders, he might have been able to prevent the crimes. The defendant claimed ignorance of the various crimes committed by the Japanese army, which was self-deception. He hoped that the court would have the courage to conduct a fair trial, otherwise, if it only went through the motions and declared him not guilty, how could they face the suffering people? Defense attorney Jiang Yiping said: The so-called doing one's utmost is a question of whether one has indeed done so or simply acted perfunctorily. From a legal standpoint, what other methods could Okamura have used to fulfill his duty besides issuing orders and warnings to his subordinates? May I ask, was Okamura preparing to use his warnings to his subordinates as evidence in court today? If there is evidence in law, a guilty verdict should naturally be given, but the defendant cannot be found guilty simply because he was the commander-in-chief. Therefore, he still requested the court to make a fair judgment based on a position of no leniency and no retaliation.

It was already 6:30, and the presiding judge announced that for the sake of solemnity, the trial could not be concluded hastily in one session and decided to adjourn it temporarily, rescheduling it for another hearing. The defendant and witnesses were taken back into custody.

### New Lending Rates Still High; Industrial Circles Deem It Inappropriate

[Report from Our Newspaper] A reporter recently interviewed a qualified person in industrial circles, who expressed strong support for the government's decisive reform of the currency system and various economic measures. However, regarding the lending rate decided by the banking, money, and trust industries the day before, with a monthly interest rate as high as 1.5%, while the highest interest rate for interbank loans before the war did not exceed 0.15%, he believed that since the authorities are now working hard to suppress prices and trying to restore them to pre-war standards, it is inappropriate for the interest rate to be as high as ten times the pre-war rate. This will inevitably have a serious impact on future prices. The generation of high-interest loans during and after the war was based on malignant inflation. Now that the currency system has been reformed, the issuance of gold yuan notes is strictly limited, currency credit has been restored, and prices have stabilized, there is no reason for interest rates to remain so high. High-interest loans are particularly unfavorable to the industrial sector, directly affecting the cost of manufacturing goods. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will pay attention to this issue as soon as possible, crack down on high-interest loans, and at the same time open up industrial loans to support industry and commerce, increase production, and stabilize prices; otherwise, it may be difficult to achieve the desired results.

### Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan Returns to Beijing; Inspects the Mint Before Departure

Xu Baiyuan, the Deputy Minister of Finance, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and exchanged views with relevant authorities on various measures in the implementation of the new economic reform plan, and attended several important meetings. Having completed his official duties, he took the night train back to Beijing on the 23rd. Before his departure, Mr. Xu also visited the Central Mint in person at 6 p.m. It is reported that the subsidiary coins ordered to be minted by the factory, in addition to the 20-cent, 10-cent, and 5-cent nickel coins, have been completed and shipped to various important cities one after another. A large number of them will be available in the market in this city within days. The remaining 1-cent steel coins and 50-cent silver coins are also being prepared and are expected to be completed in one or two months.

### Banks Busy Exchanging Foreign Currencies and Gold and Silver; Central Bank Staff Work Through the Night; Total Amount Collected to Be Announced Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Central Bank and other entrusted banks began exchanging foreign currencies, gold, and silver coins. The results were unexpectedly good. Due to the large amount of exchanges, even at 10 p.m., not only had the Central Bank itself not finished settling, but the original data from some entrusted banks had not yet been collected and submitted. The staff of the Central Bank's Business Bureau worked through the night to complete the work of the day. According to reports, the final settlement will not be completed until after midnight. Although they dare not estimate the numbers lightly, they can guarantee that it is quite considerable. These statistics will be officially released today.

When the exchange began yesterday, in addition to the Central Bank directly exchanging foreign currencies, it also entrusted the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Mercantile Bank of India, and Chase Bank to exchange them on its behalf. For gold, in addition to the Central Bank, it also entrusted the trust departments of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China to exchange them on its behalf. Silver coins were temporarily exchanged directly by the Central Bank. When the exchange began at 9 a.m., the Central Bank and the Bank of China were already packed with people and extremely crowded. Under the guidance of the management, they formed lines and proceeded in order, and the order was generally good. By evening, according to general estimates, the Central Bank had exchanged more than 30,000 yuan in silver coins and about 10,000 taels of gold. For US dollars, the Central Bank exchanged about US$60,000 in the morning, and more than that in the afternoon. The trust department of the Bank of China also exchanged about US$150,000. The details of foreign banks are unknown. By category, the most exchanged was gold, followed by foreign currency, and then silver dollars. Most of those who sold gold were banks and firms in urgent need of funds, with some single transactions involving as many as twenty or thirty gold bars. The trust department of the Bank of China limited its exchange work to foreign currencies yesterday. Except for one case of counterfeit banknotes being discovered, everything else went smoothly. Because there were too many people exchanging, the procedures for checking banknotes were very tedious, so they had to limit it to 400 people. Many who came to exchange waited all day, relying only on dry food to satisfy their hunger. In terms of the amount, the majority were between one hundred and two hundred yuan, with occasional cases as high as thirty or forty thousand yuan, but there were only two such transactions in total. According to on-the-spot investigations by reporters, the motives of those who came to exchange were nothing more than two: one was that banks and firms whose daily operations were not very sound were eager to allocate funds and had no choice but to reluctantly part with the gold and banknotes they had treasured; the other was that the exchange rate for gold and banknotes was already the same as the black market rate, while the wholesale prices of other commodities, such as cotton yarn and longcloth, were lower than the prices before the currency reform. Merchants who usually used gold and banknotes as chips did not want to leave their funds idle, so they voluntarily sold them to obtain gold yuan notes in order to replenish other goods. Regardless of the situation, the Central Bank had the opportunity to exchange a large amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency to replenish the reserve fund for the new currency.

### Bureau Chief Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau Inspects Various Markets; Informs Market Managers to Comply with the Fixed Prices of August 19

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu, the Bureau Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, inspected various markets in the city yesterday morning together with Gu Bingyuan, the Director of the Economic Administration Department. He ordered that the prices of various daily necessities must not exceed the market prices of the 19th of this month, and that violators would be severely punished. Because of the tight schedule yesterday morning, he only inspected the flour, oil, sugar, and north-south rice markets. At each market, he summoned the market managers to inform them that they must ensure compliance with the market price standards of the 19th of this month and must not raise prices arbitrarily. He also stated: If there are any violations of the regulations, and sales are conducted at prices exceeding the regulations, not only will both the buyer and seller be punished, but the market managers will also be held jointly responsible.

The Social Affairs Bureau notified all trade associations in the city yesterday to submit a list of the prices of various commodities on the 19th of this month to the bureau for reference. After the currency reform order was promulgated, the most severely inflated prices were for vegetables and fresh meat. In order to curb the surge in prices, the Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a meeting with the heads of the vegetable, fresh meat, beef and mutton, chicken and duck, local produce, and fish markets at 10 a.m. today, and a meeting with the heads of department stores at 11 a.m. He instructed the industries to voluntarily reduce the increased prices, otherwise they will be severely punished. Representatives from relevant agencies, including the police, finance, and health bureaus, were also invited to participate.

Price Lists Will Be Posted in Various Markets

The price of vegetables fluctuated again in the market yesterday morning. The Social Affairs Bureau will post price lists in various markets from today, indicating the prices of various commodities on August 19, converted to gold yuan notes. Those who exceed this price will be punished, and citizens can report them to the police at any time, and their licenses will be revoked.

Economic Police Deployed Yesterday; Butchers Warned

The City Police Bureau dispatched all economic police officers yesterday morning to the north-south rice markets, yarn and cloth markets, fuel markets, and various daily necessities markets to monitor transactions. They also went to various shops and vegetable markets with police officers from various branch bureaus to investigate whether their selling prices exceeded the prices of the 19th. The general situation was very good, but the prices in the vegetable market were still very chaotic. A butcher surnamed Zhang at No. 226 Ninghai Middle Road was arrested for raising the price of meat. More than ten other vegetable vendors were arrested and warned by the Huangpu Branch Bureau.

### Public Education Difference Pay for August Approved; Staff Receive 10.5 Gold Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Public Education Personnel Material Supply Committee held its 23rd meeting at the City Hall yesterday, presided over by Secretary-General Shen. It was decided that the rice loan and difference pay for public education personnel this month would be: Staff: three dou of rice, converted to a rice loan of 4.2 gold yuan; two units of coal briquettes, converted to a difference pay of 4.8 gold yuan; three jin of cooking oil, converted to a difference pay of 1.5 gold yuan; totaling 10.5 gold yuan. Technicians would receive 9.1 gold yuan, and laborers would receive 5.95 gold yuan.

### Jewelry Stores Flourish; Busy Exchanging Gold Jewelry

On the first day of the issuance of the gold yuan note, the business of major jewelry stores in the city suddenly became busy on the 23rd. According to Manager Qiu Tianbao, most jewelry stores were buying gold jewelry, and few were selling it. This is because the general public believed that exchanging one tael of gold jewelry for 190 gold yuan notes was not a loss, so those who needed cash rushed to jewelry stores to exchange it.

### Thoroughly Implement Emergency Plan; Defeat Enemies on the Economic Battlefield; Jiang Jingguo Addresses Officers of the Pacification and Construction Brigade

Jiang Jingguo, who was ordered to come to Shanghai to assist in supervising the implementation of the economic reform plan, addressed the officers of the Pacification and Construction Brigade yesterday, giving instructions on the current emergency economic reform work. He said in brief: The first step in this policy is to mobilize the broad masses to participate in the implementation automatically, and to gain the support and cooperation of people from all walks of life, so that it can be effectively implemented. The crimes of enemies on the economic battlefield in the rear, such as speculators and hoarders, price manipulators, and those who seek bribes and pervert the law, are no different from those of enemies on the battlefield in the front. To make the reform policy effective, it is necessary to use the power of society and launch the sanctions of public opinion to completely eliminate them. Secondly, everyone is equal before the law. The more wealthy and powerful people are, the more severely they should be punished once they violate the law, and legitimate industrial and commercial operators must be effectively protected. The main points are recorded as follows:

Eliminate Enemies in the Rear; Achieve Perfect Results

The emergency financial and economic measures recently promulgated by the President are an important policy for stabilizing social order and improving the people's lives. This policy is necessary and correct for dealing with the current economic situation. It not only concerns the personal lives of everyone, but also determines the life and death of the entire country and nation. Therefore, to support this policy is to support the interests of the country and to protect the interests of the people; to oppose this policy is to oppose the interests of the country and to help the public enemies of the people. After the policy is set, it should be implemented thoroughly and effectively. In the process of implementation, two points must be paid attention to: First, all government measures should take the interests of the majority of the people as their interests, and the broad masses must be mobilized to participate in the implementation. Only in this way can the policy take effect more quickly and be guaranteed success. Because the enemy on the military battlefield in the front is the Communist bandit, and everyone has seen his atrocities, while the enemy on the economic battlefield in the rear—such as those speculators and hoarders, price manipulators, and corrupt merchants and officials—are not easily detected. However, their crimes are no different from those of treacherous bandits. The only difference is that the murders and robberies of bandits are tangible, while the arson and murder of treacherous merchants and corrupt officials are intangible. Our Shanghai citizens with a sense of justice should recognize the true faces of the enemies in the rear and jointly sanction them and eliminate them. We believe that a large-scale national economic struggle cannot rely solely on the power of the government; we must also fully use the power of society, especially the power of the people, to completely eliminate the enemies in the rear and achieve perfect results.

Severely Punish Those Who Violate the Law; Protect Those Who Abide by the Law

Secondly, government orders must be obeyed by the people. Everyone should be equal before the law. I deeply feel that in the past, most of those who truly abided by the law were the poor, while the rich and powerful often escaped the law and did whatever they wanted. As the people of Shanghai say, "There must be a bar to have reason." The so-called bar refers to gold bars, and reason refers to the truth. The so-called "having a bar and having reason" means that having gold bars is the truth. This dark phenomenon is the main reason for the blurring of right and wrong in society today, and we must completely eliminate it. In Shanghai, it should be the case that no matter how much wealth you have or how much power you have, once you violate the law, you must be sent to prison and executed without mercy. Only then can justice be upheld, the law be enforced, and the people be convinced. However, while those who violate the law should be severely punished, we must fully protect the law-abiding and self-loving industrial and commercial operators so that industry and commerce can develop and prosper normally.

Practically Assume Responsibility; Jointly Seek Economic Stability

We can no longer gloss over the situation today, but must honestly admit that the country and the people are in the most dangerous and painful situation. Our highly paid officials should reflect deeply at this time, seize the opportunity, and do their best to serve the country and the people. As the saying goes, "Eat whose rice, do whose work." Since we eat the people's rice, we should do things for the people. As for the people themselves, they should also understand that today is the last moment for the survival of the country. Only if everyone is of one mind and united, abides by the law, and supports the national policy can we reverse the crisis with the greatest patience and the best efforts.

The environment in Shanghai is complex, and it is not easy to do a good job, but I believe that as long as we are not afraid of the oppression of power and the temptation of money, there will be nothing that cannot be done.

Recalling the hardships and dangers of the Anti-Japanese War, and seeing the suffering that the country is encountering today, one cannot help but feel infinite emotion. The suffering of our country and people is too deep. However, all difficult fates can only be transformed from danger to safety, from sorrow to joy, from bitterness to sweetness, and from darkness to light through perseverance and struggle. Such a great cause as the Anti-Japanese War has already been won under the leadership of the President, and such a powerful enemy as Japan has also been defeated by us under the leadership of the President. Then, can today's suppression of rebellion not be completed satisfactorily? Indeed, today is no longer the time to shirk responsibility, evade responsibility, or blame each other, but to strengthen confidence, abide by laws and regulations, support national policies, practically assume responsibility, and jointly seek the stability of the national economic life in order to complete the great cause of suppressing rebellion and building the country.

### An Accident Occurs During a "Bank Run"; A Thousand Yuan is Missing in an Instant; Who Should Be Responsible?

[Report from Our Newspaper] When the Central Bank was exchanging gold yesterday, a staff member of a certain company who was very young held gold worth 7,000 gold yuan for exchange. After leaving the counter, he suddenly discovered that there was a shortage of 1,000 gold yuan. He was greatly shocked at the time and urgently negotiated with the exchange personnel. The person in charge told him that since he had left the counter, the bank was not responsible. However, he agreed to check the accounts at night and if there was an extra 1,000 yuan, it might be a mistake in the rush and could be made up. However, when the accounts were cleared at night, no extra amount was found, and the staff member was still afraid to leave the exchange location because of his responsibility. How this will be resolved in the future remains to be seen.

### U.S. Consul Admonishes Colleagues to Cooperate in Promoting the New Currency System; Cabot Also Expresses Praise

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to show full cooperation with the implementation of the new currency system in our country, Mr. Cabot, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, issued a memorandum to all his colleagues in the consulate yesterday, sincerely advising them to pay attention to cooperation. Mr. Cabot specifically pointed out two points: (1) No colleague shall purchase gold yuan notes with US dollars except through legal institutions. (2) No colleague shall use US dollars unless for legitimate purposes.

[Another Report] The U.S. Naval Headquarters in Shanghai announced that Vice Admiral Badger, Commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, issued a statement on the 23rd regarding China's currency reform, saying: This move by China is beneficial to improving the current foreign exchange situation. He added: He has ordered U.S. Navy personnel under his command to comply with it.

### Economic Supervision and Reporting Meeting Discusses the Focus of Work; Strict Inspection Will Be Implemented on the Movement of Materials, Funds and Banknotes

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yu Hongjun and Jiang Jingguo, the supervisors of the Shanghai District of the Economic Supervision Committee of the Executive Yuan, held their first economic supervision and reporting meeting at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Baiyuan, Fang Zhi, Xuan Tiewu, Wu Kaixian, Yu Shuping, Lin Chongyong, Li Lixia, and others attended. The meeting lasted until 6 p.m. According to a certain person who attended the meeting, the reporter said: In today's meeting, the specific details of how to implement the various points stipulated in the new measures and the division of work were carefully studied. The focus of future work will be to stabilize prices with all efforts. Personnel will be dispatched to conduct strict inspections at land and water transportation agencies regarding the movement of materials, funds and banknotes. If there are any leaks, they will be severely punished, and will be confiscated if necessary.

### Technical Issues of Wage Calculation; Assessment Committee to Discuss Within Days; Minister Gu Returns to Beijing Last Night After Completing Official Duties

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, hosted a banquet yesterday for Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of Social Affairs, who came to Shanghai on official business. Deputy Director Zhao Banfu and the heads of various departments accompanied him. During the banquet, they asked Minister Gu for instructions on wage issues. According to Minister Gu, the standards for wage payment after the currency reform have been clearly stipulated in Article 22 of the central government's measures for reorganizing finances and strengthening economic control. The Ministry of Social Affairs has no supplementary measures for this. As for the technical details, they should be handled by the Municipal Labor-Management Assessment Committee through consultation. Subsequently, everyone put forward their opinions. The treatment of employees in various industries in this city, in addition to those who are paid according to the current index, also includes those who are paid according to the previous index, or the average index of the previous and current periods, and those who are paid after deducting the excessively high base salary. They also exchanged opinions on how to calculate technical issues such as overtime, work stoppages, reduced work, and piecework. The discussions were very detailed, but no concrete conclusions were reached. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a labor-management assessment committee within two or three days to discuss all issues.

Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, has completed his official duties in Shanghai and returned to Beijing last night.

### Public Utilities Pricing Issues; Decision to Provide Opinions to the Central Government

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Public Investigation and Review Committee held its third meeting at the City Hall yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., chaired by Mayor Wu. Zhao Cengjue, Li Wenjie, Pan Mingxin, Jiang Hao, Qu Yue, Jiang Haoran, He Yuanming, Zhang Chude, Yan E'sheng, Xiang Changquan, Zhang Rentao, and others attended. Mayor Wu first asked Deputy Director Zhang of the Public Utilities Bureau, who had just returned from attending the public utilities pricing conference in Nanjing, to report on the results of the conference. According to Zhang, when the public utilities pricing conference was held, it coincided with the central government's decision to implement currency reform. Now the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has scheduled a meeting on September 1 with relevant departments such as the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Interior to discuss the new price issues for public utilities after the currency reform. After the agreement is reached, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and will be announced and implemented nationwide simultaneously. Mayor Wu stated that since the central government has made a general decision on public utilities prices, the committee can wait for its decision. However, the public investigation must continue, and the review committee can be convened once a week. Subsequently, committee members Yan E'sheng and Jiang Haoran, among others, stated that before the central government makes a decision on public utilities prices, the committee should provide its opinions first, because the situation in Shanghai is different from other places, and the electricity supply is the highest in the country, which is of great importance. The following two resolutions were passed on the spot: (1) Support the central government's emergency measures plan for currency reform. (2) Formulate concrete opinions on public utilities prices and submit them to the central government for approval.

### Speaker Broadcasts; Significance of Elected Jia Heads

[Report from Our Newspaper] Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, for the sake of the city's general election of Jia heads, broadcasted last night at 8 p.m. on the Municipal Council radio station, expounding on the significance of the elected Jia heads: (1) This election of Jia heads is to complete the election procedures for local self-government personnel at all levels in the city; (2) From now on, a solid foundation for local self-government can be laid; (3) It is enough to break the general public's long-standing contempt for serving the local area. Finally, Speaker Pan hoped that citizens would not give up the rights that modern democratic citizens should enjoy in this election of Jia heads, and should carefully consider how to elect a fair, selfless, and enthusiastic person to serve in public affairs. At the same time, he hoped that public-spirited, impartial, and knowledgeable people in the city would actively participate in the election.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xin Xiaokang, a representative of the city's pork industry, was summoned to visit the mayor at the City Hall yesterday morning, stating the industry's transportation difficulties and the lowest cost price, and claiming that the price increase of fresh meat in recent days was entirely due to retailers raising prices without authorization, and that wholesale prices have not risen. Mr. Xin also requested the city government to exempt the temporary donation for pacifying northern Jiangsu in order to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants. The mayor promised to find a way to help. Mr. Wu also convened the heads of the fresh meat industry yesterday afternoon and instructed them to strictly prohibit unauthorized price increases.

Public debate will be held again on the 30th before a sentence is scheduled.

### Overnight Robbery on Chungcheng East Road - Loss of 50 Taels of Gold

### Three Tonics for the Northeast

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Han Qingtao

[Airmail Report from Jinzhou, 16th] Last year, the heavy snow in winter draped the Northeast in mourning, almost causing the heavily ill patient to stop the circulation of blood and suffocate. This year, the arrival of spring brought the patient some life-saving vitality. After a year of rest and stability, it has once again embarked on the road to survival. If the autumn does not cause it to lose the strength to cultivate vital energy, and the winter does not cut off its body, then the more it develops and stabilizes, the more salvation it will have. The magic bullet in reversing the tide of the situation lies in the central government's decision to create a policy of "three tonics." These three tonics are: abandoning unimportant strongholds, concentrating forces, and firmly defending the three major strongholds of Shenyang, Jinzhou, and Changchun, allowing them to fully exert their tonic effect.

The three-tonic policy has been successful. The attending physician is General Wei Lihuang, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Bandit Suppression, and he has a skilled assistant in Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang, who has helped the Northeast recover from its chronic illness. The Political Affairs Committee of the Suppression Headquarters is also playing a significant role in politics and economics.

Currently, the Northeast is beginning a comprehensive war that combines military, political, and economic efforts, hoping to find a way out in its weakness.

Two Ports, One Line

Huludao has swallowed grain and flour for the Northeast and has also spat out steel and special products for the Northeast to exchange for money. At the same time, the army lands here and boards ships here, supporting both inside and outside the customs, playing a role in offense and defense. The navy cruises the Bohai Sea and also sails from here to the Liaodong Bay. Recently, the artillery fired on Yingkou, and a strong force has been deployed around Huludao. Thus, rumors have spread again that the Nationalist army will land in Yingkou to open up the route to southern Liaoning. This is a message that may become a reality, because the throats of the northeast are the ports of Huludao and Yingkou.

In order to open up the connection between Pan[yang] and the interior, landing in Yingkou is the most advantageous and convenient. Opening up the railway between Jinzhou and Pan[yang] is more difficult, not to mention that it is difficult to defend even if it is opened up. Of course, clearing southern Liaoning and guarding the Pan[yang]-Ying[kou] route will also require a lot of troops.

The Beining Railway is a line connecting the Northeast and the interior. This line, from Pan[yang] to Jinzhou, has been cut off. The Jinzhou to interior section is unimpeded. The reopening of the Shen[yang]-Jin[zhou] line is still pending. Currently, the air force is responsible for connecting the severed lines. Although the carrying capacity is small, the 45-minute flight is very convenient. This strong air force connects the lines and also soars over the vast sea-like surface of the Northeast.

Survival Lies in Western Liaoning

The Liaoxi Corridor has been a battlefield for military strategists to strive for victory since ancient times. They shed blood and sweat here, and the soldiers spent good times here. The Tang poem, "Strike the oriole, do not let it cry on the branch, the crying startles my dreams, and I cannot reach Liaoxi," is a chant of longing for the soldiers of Liaoxi.

This year, the Nationalists firmly grasp the Liaoxi Corridor, playing a major connecting role. Offense and defense can be used freely. At the same time, the ports of Huludao and the Beining Railway are where the survival of the Northeast lies.

General Fan Hanjie, Director of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Jinzhou Command, is stationed here. The Liaoxi Corridor, the eastern end of eastern Liaoning, including Qinhuangdao, is guarded by the heavy troops under his command. He carefully uses this base as preparation for an attack.

After Sun Du handed over the power of the Yunnan-originating corps to Lu Junquan, the original commander of the 93rd Army, the newly promoted corps commander, Lu Junquan, is diligently seeking progress and boosting morale, hoping to make this eagle-like team even more powerful. Diligence and hard work will pay off.

In politics, the Liaoning Provincial Government has specially set up a "Liaoxi Administrative Office" here, with He Kui (also Deputy Commander of the Anti-Banditry Command in the Ji-Re-Liao Border Area) as the director of the administrative office to carry out government affairs. Jin City, Jin County, Yang County, Jinxi, Xingcheng, and Suizhong are all under the command of the Liaoxi Administrative Office. He Kui said, "I am the bridge between the military and the civilians in Western Liaoning."

In order to strengthen the political, economic, and military coordination in Western Liaoning, the Political Affairs Committee of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters has specially dispatched an advisor, Wei Keng, to set up an office in Jin[zhou] so that the Northeast's overall war can be carried out smoothly. The sorghum is fat, and the soybeans are fragrant. This autumn, Western Liaoning will have a good harvest!

Eastern Hebei is connected to Western Liaoning. Bandits enter and exit the besieged city from Eastern Hebei, planning to cut off the traffic of the Beining Railway inside and outside the customs. The campaign to sweep Eastern Hebei in August was victorious, recovering Qian'an, Lulong, and Zunhua, forcing the bandits to stay away and suffer casualties. The bandit's attempt was completely crushed.

In this way, the section of the Beining Railway inside and outside the customs can be even more unobstructed. With the addition of Qinhuangdao and Huludao, which are exerting their import and export power, Jinzhou and Shenyang can be even more integrated. If Yingkou is recovered and Southern Liaoning is opened up, the situation can be greatly changed.

Changchun is isolated and suspended, but Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Bandit Suppression, does not allow the besieging bandits to move one step further into the city. He leads about two armies and more people, enduring hunger and suffering, defending the city and exerting a great force to contain the bandits.

Flat, Bright Road

It is estimated that the Nationalist army in the Northeast has about 300,000 troops. There are about eight armies around Shenyang, about five armies in Western Liaoning and eastern Hebei, and about two armies in Changchun. The troops in Pan[yang] and Chang[chun] are mostly elite troops, while the troops in Western Liaoning are mostly new forces.

The bandit leader Lin Biao has the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th Columns (whether the 5th and 12th Columns exist is still under investigation) of the field army and several independent divisions and regiments, as well as Mongolian cavalry, Hui Muslim, and Korean Communist detachments, plus local armed forces, claiming to have 500,000 men. The actual number is still difficult to determine.

Lin Biao deployed most of the bandit troops in northern Liaoning for reorganization and training, without any movement for more than half a year. In addition to some internal reasons why he dared not move, it was because many poor and remote areas had already been exhausted, so he had to eat and use it for a long time in northern Liaoning, which is known as the "granary of the Northeast."

Now, the bandit forces are extremely short of ammunition and food, so the bandits in the Northeast will not move unless they have to. The move must be when the sorghum is ripe. The move must be when there is an opportunity to take advantage of in order to solve the supply problem and find cheap solutions. After the autumn harvest in mid-September, it will be convenient to eat, grab guns, and move around. That may be when the bandits start to stir up trouble.

The Nationalist army is accumulating strength and energy, not launching attacks easily, and not changing the "three-point policy," so that the bandits have no gaps to attack and no opportunities to take advantage of. The current task is how to guarantee the autumn harvest, get through the winter, and then welcome a vibrant spring.

The main thing in the overall situation of the Northeast is to maintain the status quo, seeking development in stability. This year, there are still two major hurdles after the autumn harvest and in the snow and ice. After passing these, the road will become flatter and brighter.

### Changzhou Special Relief Donation - Only 193 Billion Collected

[Report from Our Newspaper, Wujin 22nd] The special relief donation has been closed. Regarding the extremely wealthy who refuse to pay the special donation, the general assembly will be requested to punish them severely. The 25 billion assigned to Jiangyin has not yet been paid. The total amount of donations collected from local merchants and Shanghai merchants in our county is 193 billion yuan. The donation will be opened at Rensheng Bank in a special account, and reported daily to the Nanjing district branch for investigation. The shortfall will be resolved in the second phase of fundraising.

[Another Report] The collection of this year's land tax is still using the Yitu system. The method is that the township chief is appointed by each township to take turns at the end of the year. The rotation of the largest is once every ten years or more. The person in charge is responsible for the clear collection of land tax in one place, guiding the signing of the Yitu covenants to perfect them, and completing them before October 15.

### Changshu Park Bridge Case - Police Chief and University Students - Heated Debate for Two Hours

[Report from Our Newspaper, Changshu 20th] Recently, the county has staged a strange drama due to the police bureau's forcible interference with college students from Shanghai who came to Changshu to conduct a survey and practice "Bridge" (card game). The local newspapers gave it a very prominent position, publishing a feature of thousands of words, analyzing the process of this "case," and it temporarily became a topic of conversation in the streets and alleys along with the new currency issue.

More than 20 students from the School of Engineering of St. John's University in Shanghai came to Changshu a week ago to practice surveying and assist in construction work. On the 20th, the preliminary work of surveying the Huan Shan Road outside the West was completed, so they gathered in Zhongshan Park, sat down between sipping tea, and played "Bridge" to relax. Unexpectedly, this alarmed the park police, who reported to the police bureau, believing that someone was openly gathering in a public place to gamble. Therefore, a patrol officer was dispatched to lead a large number of police officers to the scene to arrest them. After arriving, because the students did not admit that playing "Bridge" was a criminal act, and repeatedly stated that after searching through Chinese and foreign law codes, there had never been an explicit provision that Bridge players should be treated as perpetrators. Therefore, they only agreed to send two representatives to explain to the bureau chief. After arriving at the bureau, the two students stated that the nature of Bridge was the same as that of chess, and tried their best to explain the misunderstanding. However, Director Huang always believed that although the students did not gamble, they could be considered to have constituted "similar gambling" behavior and should be detained for seven days. Considering that the offenders were college students, they were exempted from prosecution. However, the student representatives believed that they had not committed any crime at all and refused to accept the director's "exemption from prosecution." When signing the record of interrogation, they also noted that they did not admit to being regarded as "perpetrators." After two hours of heated debate, the two sides stuck to their own words, and there was no result. Finally, the bureau ruled to destroy the playing cards. The students refused to accept this and expressed their intention to file an administrative lawsuit in accordance with the law. The future development of this case is worth watching.

### Liuyang Grain Boats Transporting Rice Out of the Territory - Hungry People Resolutely Prevented from Leaving

[Report from Our Newspaper, Changsha 23rd] The Liuyang County Government and the Township Office secretly transported a large number of grains of rice out of the territory in the name of the vehicle, resulting in public outrage from the hungry people. On August 8, there were 12 grain boats transporting them out. Hundreds of people gathered and prevented them from leaving. The county government sent troops to suppress them, and arrested nearly a hundred old, weak, women, and children in the chaos, detaining them in the police bureau. After receiving the report, the Xiang Security Department sent a letter to the High Court requesting that Prosecutor Liao Jingchi go to interrogate them in a special car on the 22nd.

### Serious Flooding in Pixian County - Autumn Crops Submerged - People and Livestock Adrift

[Report from Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang 22nd] Pixian County has suffered from floods since the beginning of August due to the flooding of the Fangting and Bulao Rivers in southern Pixian. Later, due to the outbreak of mountain floods in southern Shandong, the Si, Wen, and Zi Rivers all overflowed. The water depth on the plains was more than ten feet. The disaster area accounted for more than 95% of the entire territory. The autumn crops were submerged, and people and livestock were adrift. The situation was extremely tragic.

### Rectifying Jiangsu Province Prisons - Guards to be Trained

[Report from Our Newspaper, Suzhou 20th] In order to rectify the discipline of prison guards in various places, the Ministry of Justice and Administration specifically ordered the high courts of various provinces to set up training classes for prison guards, which were required to be established on October 1. Guards from various prisons were transferred to the class for training, and the instructors were the wardens and senior officials of the prisons.

### Strange Incident with a Mottled Duck - Egg within an Egg

[Report from Our Newspaper, Taicang 21st] Lai, of Xinhun Lai Store in Huchuan Goujing, raises several female ducks, including a mottled duck. Since the fifth day of the first lunar month this year, it has laid one egg every day, which has been deeply cherished by the owner. On the morning of the 20th, the duck walked with a staggering gait, as if there was something wrong. Before long, it laid two huge eggs in a row, weighing about fifteen taels in total. The shape was no different from ordinary eggs. When cracked and viewed, the yolk and white were complete. However, there was still another egg inside, which was also hard. When dissected again, there were double yolks inside, both eggs being the same. The store owner was overjoyed, calling it a good omen.

### Gallnuts: The Season for Appearance

— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Report from Guiyang, from our newspaper on the 20th] A special product of Guizhou, an industrial raw material that parasitizes wild plants, is ubiquitous and requires no human cultivation. It can be used in modern organic chemical industries for medicines, pharmaceuticals, various organic dyes, and its economic value even exceeds that of the highly valued "Guizhou American Tobacco." Its name is "Gallnut."

It parasitizes a wild plant called "Salt Sumac," a type of insect gall formed after aphids reside on it. The so-called "Salt Sumac" belongs to the Sumac family and grows in the mountains of Yunnan and Guizhou. It is a deciduous tree, one to two zhang tall, with odd-pinnate compound leaves about a foot long. The leaflets are oblong-ovate, and the petiole has wings between the leaflets. In summer, small greenish-white flowers bloom at the tips, bearing small drupes densely covered with purple and white short hairs. As they mature, aphids gather, spreading salt-like powder on the surface and back of the leaves, building their nests, gradually forming tumor-like lumps, which turn reddish-brown when mature. These varying sizes are what we commonly call "Gallnuts." The reason why this wild plant is called "Salt Sumac" is explained by Li Shizhen in his "Compendium of Materia Medica" from the Ming Dynasty: "Its taste is salty, hence the name," and also "The outer skin of the drupe has a thin layer of salt, which children eat; the people of Yunnan and Sichuan consider it wood salt."

Statistical Dominance Before the War

Gallnuts are found throughout the counties of Guizhou, especially in areas close to Yunnan and Sichuan. Although villagers did not fully understand its use before the war, they picked and sold it in the city when they saw people buying it. Although the price was very low, it could supplement the household income in rural areas. According to pre-war global statistics, China ranked first in gallnut production, and Japan ranked second. Among the provinces in China, Guizhou and Yunnan had the largest output. Because Salt Sumac is very selective about soil and climate, the lunar June and July on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau are when the monsoon from the Indian Ocean brings moisture to the provinces, creating a humid climate ideal for Salt Sumac growth. By late summer and early autumn, it is the breeding season for aphids, and Salt Sumac grows all over the mountains and plains of Yunnan and Guizhou, producing large quantities of gallnuts. Before the opening of sea trade, villagers generally only knew that gallnuts were a not-so-valuable prize. After merchants from Japan and Germany came to China to purchase gallnuts in large quantities, the villagers realized that gallnuts were valuable.

Japanese and German Merchants Purchase and Return Home

Japanese and German merchants bought gallnuts and took them back to their countries, made them into finished products, and then shipped them back to China or sold them to various countries around the world, earning profits tens of thousands of times greater than their initial investment. At that time, China did not have refining factories, nor was anyone willing to invest in this type of chemical industry, so it completely relied on foreign finished products, watching others make money. During the Anti-Japanese War, international routes were blocked, and the need for gallnuts in China increased sharply. Huanghai Chemical Company and the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Health made an order to produce subgallate, needing gallic acid as a supporting medicine, and then began to study the process of using gallnuts to produce gallic acid. For the first time in China, gallnuts were processed from raw materials into finished products. The factory was located in Nanchuan, Sichuan, to facilitate proximity to Yunnan and Guizhou for easy purchase of gallnuts. However, due to insufficient capital, a loan was taken from the Agricultural Bank, but the business declined, and the work was suspended. In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic, the Farmers Bank was requested to take over the operation, continuing small-scale operations to demonstrate advocacy. The finished product was named "Gallic Acid" to distinguish it from imported products, instead of using the transliteration of "Gallic Acid."

Common Uses Are Roughly Divided into Three Categories

Gallic acid has a wide range of uses, mostly in photography, ink, dyeing, papermaking, medicine, copperplate and lithography, electroplating, winemaking, and more. According to reports from Huanghai Chemical Company, the most common uses can be divided into three categories: (1) Organic chemical industrial pharmaceuticals, such as the manufacture of water, pyrogallic acid, benzoic acid, etc. (2) Pharmaceuticals, such as the manufacture of gallic acid methyl ester, gallic acid aluminum, iodoform, dermatol, subgallate, eurol, etc. (3) Organic dyes, such as the manufacture of Gamboge, alizarin green, gallic acid cyanine, etc.

Exporting Raw Materials, Importing Finished Products

In recent years, the trial production and sale of gallic acid in China have been very satisfactory. In important areas, there are already good sales channels. For example, Qinghua Pigment Factory, Dagong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Dacheng Dye Factory are the most scaled factories in Chongqing, and they all use it in large quantities. Others, such as the aircraft Research Institute’s deerskin making factory, and other small leather factories, ink factories, etc. are also happy to purchase it. After the gallic acid was produced, there were also plans for foreign sales. In the 33rd year of the Republic, Fuxing Company specially sent samples to the World Trading Company in the United States to explore the sales market in the United States. In the winter of that year, a reply was received from the company stating that after chemical testing, the quality was slightly inferior to the general quality in the United States, but the market was still marketable, and it was estimated that the price was about one US dollar per pound, delivered in New York at that time. In the 35th year of the Republic, Jardine Matheson, a British merchant stationed in Chongqing, sent samples to the UK for chemical testing, intending to order a large quantity for refined production in the UK. However, due to the limited inventory in our factory, it was abandoned. Foreigners are very concerned about the production and sales of gallnuts in China, and this is not only because gallic acid is now produced. As mentioned earlier, Japanese and German merchants have always purchased gallnuts in China. Before the war, they purchased at least 1.5 million dan in China every year, and the price was of course very low, but we still had to buy their finished products back at a very high price.

Blocked Outlets, Great Material Submerged

The production of gallnuts in Guizhou has gradually decreased in recent years. The reason is that the outlets are blocked, no one protects them, and no one pays attention to them. Even if they grow in the mountains, they are allowed to grow and die on their own, burying such useful materials, which is a real pity! Especially the ignorant villagers, relying on the old method of slash-and-burn agriculture, often set fires to burn the mountains before the vernal equinox, using grass ash as fertilizer, and opening up burned fields for cultivation, indiscriminately destroying the mountains and forests, burning the seeds of aphids, thereby reducing the production of gallnuts. In addition, in recent years, the chaos has been military busy, transportation tools are lacking, and freight rates are too high. The volume of gallnuts is large and the weight is small, occupying a larger position during transportation. General boat and vehicle transportation are calculated by cubic feet instead of their actual substance, merchants of course value the economic value of purchasing and exporting gallnuts is far behind the consumption of American tobacco, and even no one cares. These times, when the new gallnuts are coming on the market, the market price of new products is 40 million yuan per 100 jin, and the old products is 60 million yuan. Compared with the top gold leaf of Guiding American tobacco at 8 million yuan per 100 jin and the secondary yellow at 6.5 million yuan, things with economic value are so cheap, is it not strange!

Strictly Prohibit Burning Mountains, Set Up a Demonstration Factory

Gallnuts are useful products parasitizing wild plants. They do not require the hard work of cultivating, transplanting, fertilizing, etc. like American tobacco, and they are rich in international economic value and are the most needed raw materials for the national chemical industry. They should not be allowed to be buried for a long time. The reporter believes that the government authorities should at least earnestly achieve "Strictly prohibit burning mountains," so that the villagers know to protect Salt Sumac and the aphids on it, in order to increase the production of gallnuts. Secondly, small-scale demonstration factories should be set up in appropriate areas within Guizhou to teach Chenmin how to refine gallic acid.

### First Day of the Gold Yuan Issuance: Banks Crowded with Customers Making Deposits and Withdrawals; Financial Market Liquidity Stable, Slightly Tight Outside the Market

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the Gold Yuan began to be issued. Since banks were closed for three consecutive days, all sectors urgently needed to withdraw cash for their needs. Therefore, most banks were crowded with customers making deposits and withdrawals in the morning. However, each bank had already prepared cash in advance, and they actively collected overdue loans, so the liquidity within the financial market was very stable, while the liquidity of various industries outside the market was tight, and the black market rate was around six jiao (calculated in legal tender).

According to the results of the check clearing, the Four Banks, Two Offices, and One Treasury had a difference of 5,035,000 yuan, of which the Central Bank had a difference of 2,899,000 yuan. Large clearing had an inflow of 439,000 yuan from the Four Banks, and an inflow of 396,000 yuan from foreign businesses. Small clearing was balanced. The Bank of China had an outflow of 2,220,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications had an inflow of 336,000 yuan, the China Agricultural Bank had an outflow of 227,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications had an inflow of 52,000 yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau had an outflow of 122,000 yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury had an inflow of 45,000 yuan. The total number of checks cleared yesterday was 57,000, and the total amount cleared was approximately 93.37 million yuan, both of which were higher than before. In addition, due to the first-time use of Gold Yuan checks yesterday, there were many errors in all sectors, resulting in a particularly large number of returned checks. The entire calculation was cleared up at 11 o'clock, it is said.

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday was the first day of the issuance of the Gold Yuan, and the foreign exchange market was quite calm. With the Gold Yuan exchange rate against foreign currencies now fixed, people in import and export sectors are becoming more calm and are not as eager to settle foreign exchange as before. Therefore, the amount of foreign exchange settlement is less than before. Throughout the day, the sale of export exchange certificates was greater, and the initial rate was 3.33 Gold Yuan, but the most transactions were made at 3.20 Gold Yuan.

The designated banks have decided to convene a meeting on the 25th to discuss everything, as there may be areas for improvement in various foreign exchange settlement procedures at the beginning of the implementation of the Gold Yuan.

### Public Sentiment Stable, Store Inventory Weak; Rice Prices Listless; Flour, Grains, Oil, and Cakes All Decline and Soften

The rice market resumed trading yesterday. The market announced that prices were all standardized in Gold Yuan and stipulated that they should not exceed the prices of the 19th. Yesterday, public sentiment in the market was stable, and rice stores had very little inventory. At the beginning of the market, cargo owners listed prices in accordance with the prices of the 19th, but due to sluggish sales, the market declined, and due to the extreme shortage of silver, cargo owners actively sold, resulting in a drop in prices. Beishi white japonica rice was 20 yuan, and thin early rice and Yangxian rice each fell by about one yuan. Special high-quality japonica rice was 22 yuan, a decrease of 7 jiao. The closing price in Nanshi market also fell by 5 or 6 jiao. Yesterday, 5,717 shi arrived in the two markets.

Flour prices fell. After the currency system reform, public sentiment was very stable, and retail investors and actual sales were less involved. Sales channels were narrower, and the sudden tightening of silver made those holding goods eager to sell, so the closing price was even more fictitious. The opening price of Laoche flour was 7.25 yuan, but due to the continuous outflow, it entered within 7 yuan and closed at 6.85 yuan, a drop of 7 jiao. Bingchuan flour fell by 6 jiao, and each fell by about 10%. Miscellaneous brands of flour uniformly fell by 6 or 7 jiao, and bran opened at 5.2 yuan, a decrease of 3 or 4 jiao.

Miscellaneous grains began to be traded in Gold Yuan, but public sentiment was very stable, and guest merchants had very little interest. Sales channels were sluggish, but due to the tight silver, cargo owners sold a lot. The opening price of soybeans was still flat, but the closing price fell by 5 jiao due to the large drop in oil cakes. Hankou Zha beans fell within 10 yuan. Broad beans were still stable. Corn, Yuan wheat, and North wheat were not taken, falling by more than 10%. Tea bean transactions were almost extinct. Red grain has not been opened. Sesame prices were tired and stagnant. Cargo owners listed the price of raw kernels at one yuan lower, and Guang merchants ate the price at four yuan lower, so no transaction was made.

Cooking oil resumed trading, but due to sluggish actual sales and poor sales channels, and the sudden tightening of silver, cargo owners sold a lot, and prices therefore fell. Dayou soybean oil was 49 yuan, Dachangxin, etc. were 48.5 yuan, and raw rapeseed oil was 43 yuan, each falling by 3.5 yuan. Raw oil fell by 5.3 yuan, and Jilong raw oil was 58 yuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil was 50 yuan, a decrease of 5 yuan. Transactions were not active yesterday, and the market was very weak.

### Municipal Education Bureau Convened Yesterday Middle School Moral Education Discussion Meeting; Local Leaders Instruct on Points to be Paid Attention To

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Moral Education Discussion Meeting convened by the Municipal Education Bureau was held yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the Shanghai West Middle School. Attendees included over 100 moral education directors, physical education directors, and scout teachers from public and private secondary schools. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and Chairman Fang all attended and gave instructions. First, Bureau Director Li of the Education Bureau clarified that the responsibility of moral education personnel is to guide students' extracurricular activities, and explained that the Education Bureau has formulated methods for guiding students' extracurricular activities as a guideline for promoting moral education in schools in the future. Mayor Wu said in his speech: The failure of education in our country in recent years lies in the lack of cultivation of principles of conduct among young people. Currently, most teachers see students as objects to be fed, while students see teachers as tools for imparting knowledge. There is no emotional connection between them, let alone guiding teachers who uphold morality, which greatly affects the revival of the nation and the country. He sincerely hoped that all those responsible for guidance could emulate Mr. Zhang Boling's teaching according to aptitude, deeply understand all the words and deeds of students, and then provide guidance, so as to tailor their approach to the individual and achieve results. Speaker Pan pointed out that the issue of moral education in middle schools is particularly important at this critical juncture of the country's survival. Students should be instilled with the principles of conduct, and he pointed out that the two words "慎獨" (shèn dú, be cautious when alone), which emphasizes self-discipline and integrity even when one is alone, should be the focus of future moral education. Chairman Fang believes that in the current moral education system, there is no clear division of responsibilities between students' parents and school moral education personnel. In the future, this should be improved to enable close cooperation between schools and parents. After the three gentlemen finished their instructions, there was a ten-minute break. Then, the schools reported on the implementation of moral education, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. Starting today, discussions on various guidance programs will begin, and the meeting is scheduled to close tomorrow afternoon.

### Our World Games Basketball Team Defeats Iraq by a Large Margin; Scoring a Goal Every Half Minute; Great Praise from British and French Newspapers

— Special Correspondent for Our Newspaper, Zhong Zhen

[Report from Our Newspaper, London] The Iraqi basketball team is weak in strength. Even if any university basketball team in our country comes here, it can undoubtedly win. Today (August 6th) at 10:20 AM in the Harringay Gymnasium, our country played against that team. As expected by the reporter, with 125 to 25 points, it set a new basketball record for this conference. Because our army wanted to compete for the second-class ranking in this battle, all the team members performed extremely hard. Now, the competition process is recorded as follows:

(Yu Ruizhang) Huang Tianxi

Wu Chengzhang (Jia Zhijun)

(Wu Chengzhang) Cai Wenhua

Li Shiqiao Bao Songyuan

At the beginning, the Chinese team still used the five fierce generals who fought yesterday. Once the ball was opened, our army used fast and skilled techniques to continuously shoot baskets, scoring 19 times. Iraq had no room to fight back. Our army's two guards, Huang Tianxi and Bao Songyuan, once they grabbed the ball, they would immediately pass it far to the forwards. In a short time, with a whistle, another goal was scored. Therefore, within ten minutes, the score soared to 30 to 6. In the next few minutes, due to the lack of strength of the team members, the Iraqi team scored several goals, making it 30 to 10. Our army quickly launched an offensive again, with agile movements, quickly scoring goals. Especially the number of balls thrown by left forward Wu Chengzhang was simply uncountable, killing the Iraqi team and leaving no one left. The result of the first half ended with 54 to 14.

### Thunderous Applause, Constant Cheers

In the second half, the site was changed to fight again. Because the instructor Li Shiqiao's body had not yet recovered after the illness, Yu Ruizhang took charge of the left forward, while Wu Chengzhang was the right forward, and Jia Zhijun also replaced Cai Wenhua. After our country's team dispatched players, its strength was even more sufficient, and the connection was extremely tacit. The number of goals scored was still countless, from 54 to 14. It rose to 90 to 14, almost scoring a goal every half minute. It is rare to see two teams with such different strengths competing against each other. The Chinese team's passing was wonderful and clear, and the shooting was accurate. The audience in the stands on both sides gave thunderous applause and constant cheers. The small Iraqi team scored several goals, reaching 105 to 20 in the last ten minutes. At this time, our army's battle situation. All the team members who fought were covered in sweat and extremely tired. This time, the Iraqi team competed against any team in the group, all counting in the hundreds, but they never lost as many as 125 points. Therefore, the newspapers here and the Paris Daily News have successively published the Chinese team's battle situation, praising our country's basketball team's speed and shooting accuracy, calling it the crown of the countries participating this time. But the short stature and weak physical strength are the biggest shortcomings. Therefore, if our country pays attention to national physique and promotes sports in the future, there may be hope of winning a championship in the next World Games.

### Two Hundred Disabled War Veterans Compete in Wheelchair Sports; Unprecedented Event in Richmond Park, London

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcast: Two hundred British heroes who were injured in this war while defending their country recently held an unprecedented disabled automatic wheelchair competition in Richmond Park, led by British Navy Captain Dan Li. The items included (1) slow race, (2) driving skills test, (3) obstacle course, (4) egg-and-spoon race, etc. The competition was extremely fierce, and some even traveled hundreds of miles in their wheelchairs to attend. Captain Dan Li, who led this conference, once crossed the Alps in a wheelchair. The honorary award for the best-maintained wheelchair was won by a devoted couple who survived polio. The wheelchair was specially designed for two people to sit together, and they spent their honeymoon on this memorable wheelchair two years ago.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] The Richmond Park Olympic Camp will hold a world-class sports competition this afternoon, where 200 disabled people will drive mechanized or other wheelchairs, gathering in the park to compete in speed and driving skills. Some of them come from hundreds of kilometers away. Some obstacles will be built in the stadium, and the contestants must also perform several mechanical repairs in the shortest possible time.

### Open Tennis Championships, Women's Singles Start Today

The Open Tennis Tournament was suspended for three days due to rain since last Saturday. It will continue to be practiced today. The first game is the women's singles.

### Is China Poor?

— Ze Shi

If I were to ask you this question, you would surely answer without thinking: "Of course it is poor!" However, after careful consideration, I cannot help but say: China is not poor!

One piece of evidence of this is the shortage or exorbitant demands of domestic helpers in Shanghai. Newspapers often report bankruptcies in the countryside, with villagers rushing to Shanghai to make a living, and also mention refugees from war-torn areas flocking to Shanghai. Logically, in times of oversupply of labor, these women from the countryside and refugee areas should find domestic work a viable way to make a living in Shanghai, where life is expensive and they are unfamiliar with the area. However, the reality is that although employment agencies are filled with people of all ages, families who want to hire someone for even half a year face great difficulty. Even if you offer a good wage and treat them well, it is rare to find someone. My family has not employed a domestic helper for three years and does not plan to in the future. Therefore, I am not complaining for my own sake, but after witnessing the replacement of domestic helpers in the homes of my neighbors almost twenty times in the past three months, I am compelled to say this.

On the other hand, while ordinary people in Shanghai find life difficult, the demand for domestic helpers is so high that those willing to do the work quit at the slightest dissatisfaction, showing no reluctance to leave and considering themselves superior to even heads of organizations. According to the law of supply and demand, this indicates that there are many people who can afford to employ domestic helpers. If everyone can afford to employ domestic helpers, how can we say that China is poor?

Another piece of evidence that China is not poor is the wasteful use of electricity in general stores and residences. On the one hand, people resolutely oppose price increases, while on the other hand, they do not know how to economize. This gives Western newspapers a valid reason to say: "Are you asking profit-seeking companies to lose money to supply you with two hundred electric lights burning all night while you play mahjong?" If you don't believe the wasteful use of electricity in Shanghai, conduct a survey.

Yet another piece of evidence that China is not poor is the donation notice from the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau. According to Western newspapers, someone received a notice requiring them to donate 45,000 yuan in legal tender, while the beautiful notification slip, envelope, and postage were estimated to cost 245,000 yuan, not including employee salaries and other expenses.

These examples may be limited to certain corners of Shanghai, but that is probably the case. However, unless the people and organizations of Shanghai are separate from the five races of China, otherwise, judging by what people say, Shanghai people consider themselves superior or are respected by people from urban and rural areas. In terms of location, Shanghai is still a place bombarded by international views, yet they are so unwilling to endure hardship and so ignorant of thrift. Even if this is not enough to represent the flaws of the entire nation, it at least casts a bad shadow over the whole country.

Lately, I have been constantly concerned about the fate of China, and I often make wild statements. I hope we can all learn from each other and improve.

### Old Beijing Sweets

— Yi Yun

What makes Beijing memorable is its climate and way of life, which are relatively comfortable. In terms of food, not only do the restaurants in the five districts have delicious dishes, but also the various sweets sold in the markets are exquisite and unmatched elsewhere. Unfortunately, in recent years, the economy has been sluggish, and prices have risen daily, so the feeling is not as good as before. The details are as follows:

(1) Candied Fruits: These are divided into two categories: dry and wet. Dry candied fruits such as apples, sand pears, peaches, apricots, and pears have always been excellent products of Beijing because they are made from carefully selected fresh fruits, each piece intact, candied with sugar, and pure without residue, so they are sweet, crisp, and tender, and very delicious. Today, most are not as good as before. Only Jushenghe outside Qianmen still maintains the old flavor, but the other items in this shop are also not as good as before. Wet candied fruits such as fried hawthorn berries, candied crabapples, candied sea buckthorn, candied plums, and candied cherries each have their own skills, but are inferior to what they used to be.

(2) Sweet Pastries: These are the special products of the Manchu pastry shops in Beijing, such as Sachima, Furong Cake, Big and Small Eight Pieces, Oil Cake, Zilai Bai (moon cake), Fresh Flower Rose Cake, Fresh Flower Teng Luo Cake, etc. Currently, only Lao Jufeng Xiao outside Qianmen and Ruifang Jing at Dongsi Archway have acceptable products; Zhengmingzhai and Juqingzhai outside Qianmen are second; and the rest are on par with the masses. In the past, these shops used butter and honey to make various "fan mao" (white flaky pastry) products, which were very popular. Now, raw materials have become more expensive, so they have to cut corners, resulting in fewer layers of "fan mao" and less oil, making them dry and sticky, with a much weaker sweet taste than before. Some shops even mix in wheat flour, which is even more tasteless.

(3) Other: Such as sugar goods (including sugar dumplings, candied winter melon strips, candied water chestnuts, candied lotus root, candied taro, tangerine peel, etc.), except for sugar dumplings, which are still acceptable, most of the rest are hard and not sweet, and none can compare to what they used to be. As for the sugar category (including various fruit candies, fudge, etc.), the stalls in the Dong'an Market sell better ones, but they are much inferior to what they used to be, and the rest are even worse. As for southern-style pastries, shops such as Daoxiangcun and Guixiangcun used to promote Suzhou, Shanghai, and Jiaxing-Huzhou delicacies, and their business was quite good, but their products were not as good as those in Suzhou and Shanghai. Recently, they have been declining, but the sweetness is slightly stronger than in the northern shops.

(4) Street stalls and street vendors: Such as millet tea, sliced cake, sugar peas, pea flour cake, barley porridge, fried rice cake, fried cake, bean curd cake, etc., although they are still readily available, they are all greatly inferior due to the principle of cutting corners.

(5) Cold Items: Beijing's sour plum soup was originally very famous, but the ones sold now are too little sweet. As for the other items, they are even less worth mentioning.

In short, life in Beijing is becoming increasingly difficult, and people have to practice thrift. The above-mentioned sweets are somewhat extravagant, and with the current shortage of materials, the number of people who can afford to buy them at high prices is decreasing daily. In order to maintain their business, the shops have to lower their prices to attract customers, and the products are also becoming increasingly inferior. In addition, the price of sugar is extremely high, and wages are rising daily. If you want to get the old flavor, you can only order custom-made items from them at a high price, and you may still get good products.

### Roosevelt's Misstep

— Jin Yu

The most important thing in wartime is to accurately assess the enemy's situation. If the commander makes mistakes in this area for various reasons, the tragic consequences are inevitable.

However, even President Roosevelt, who was so intelligent, made a very serious miscalculation in World War II, resulting in heavy losses—he did not expect that an old "hero" in his eighties would willingly recognize a thief as his father!

When Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited the United States and Britain one after another, the then Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General Marshall, immediately reported to Roosevelt: The Second Front in Europe could definitely be opened in 1942. Roosevelt gladly told this promise to Molotov, and Molotov gladly returned to the Soviet Union. The friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union reached its peak.

However, in 1942, after Marshall, Roosevelt's special envoy Hopkins, and US Admiral King went to Britain together for a staff meeting, all the plans were overturned. The British command believed that opening the Second Front in Europe at this time would inevitably result in a disastrous defeat, and they strongly advocated landing in North Africa.

Stalin was naturally very unhappy about this, but Roosevelt, after much consideration, accepted the British opinion.

The starting date of the North African landing was November 8 of the following year. When all the preparations were almost complete, Roosevelt wrote many letters to the heads of state of various countries with colonies in North Africa, stating the motives for the landing.

Among these letters, one was addressed to the French General Pétain. Roosevelt's wording was extremely tactful, beginning by calling Pétain "old friend," and continuing with phrases such as "We were comrades in arms in 1918, and defeating Germany, the old enemy of France, is also our common desire today..." At the same time, Roosevelt repeatedly asked Churchill that the North African landing should be entirely the responsibility of the US military, because the friendship between the United States and France was long-standing, the success of the American Revolution relied on French assistance, and the United States also rescued France in World War I, so the French garrison in North Africa would definitely not resist during the landing, and the overall situation could be settled without bloodshed.

Roosevelt's intention was profound. On the one hand, he was indeed convinced that the French garrison in North Africa would not resist, but on the other hand, he had another trick—at that time, the ambitious De Gaulle was under the full support of the British army, but Roosevelt had always disliked De Gaulle's boastful and arrogant empty facade, and he was determined not to let De Gaulle have the opportunity to stand out.

After Churchill read Roosevelt's letter to Pétain, he said, "It's written too politely!" Roosevelt thought for a moment and deleted all the words such as "old friend."

Pétain's reply came, but it was a letter as sharp as a blade! Not a word was mentioned about American-French friendship. Instead, it said coldly, "You have insulted France. Since you have ordered the attack, I have ordered self-defense!"

As a result, there was a major battle for three days and nights, and the casualties on both the American and French sides were very heavy. The "hero of the Battle of Verdun" in Roosevelt's mind turned out to be a traitor! The United States fought an unnecessary battle, and the Second Front was delayed by two years before it was opened, only to give Germany the opportunity to prepare calmly. (Excerpted from Hopkins' Secret Memoirs)

### Talking About Regret

— Ji Mu

I don't regret things afterwards when I make mistakes in handling things. For example, if I plan to invest in a certain security, and I accidentally make a mistake and fail to buy it, but the price rises a few days later, even many times the original price, I don't feel any remorse. Instead, I am willing to think calmly, analyze the causes and consequences of success or failure, and if there are mistakes, I will find ways to improve them to avoid repeating them in the future. On the contrary, regretting it afterwards only brings self-inflicted troubles and hinders sound thinking.

Before, I used to make the mistake of hesitating when dealing with things. Indeed, there are many things in society that make people feel difficult. Confucius said, "Think thrice before acting," which also means that we should be careful when dealing with things. But once you have "thought thrice," you must "act." According to a certain businessman, even if you "act" wrongly, you can still find ways to remedy it, which is better than sitting and doing nothing.

Originally, not knowing regret is often regarded as not knowing remorse. What I am saying here about not regretting refers to not making emotional and unnecessary annoyance, but making a calm review from a rational point of view. The meaning is quite different.

### Double Lotus

— Zhu Ying

A double lotus stem can bloom four flowers, or three flowers, and at least two flowers. The petals are numerous and red, and the outer petals gradually become larger and lighter in color. The flowers are as large as peonies, so they are also called peony lotuses. It is said that the flower species comes from India, so it is extremely rare. The flowers do not bear fruit, and they dry up on the branches at the end of autumn. The underground rhizomes are no different from ordinary lotus flowers, so it is said that there are double lotus flowers, but no double lotus roots. In my hometown of Nanyang Lake, one or two flowers can be seen blooming on the lake. People often regard them as auspicious omens, because they will not bloom the following year. It is said that when the flower is in bud, if you touch it with your finger, it will not grow again, and it is called the fairy product among flowers.

### Chen Xiaoshi

— Qian Dacheng

Reading the Shen Bao of the 19th of this month, I learned that Chen Xiaoshi, the Governor-General of Kuizhou, died of illness in Shanghai on the 18th. Xiaoshi was smart and long-lived, but in his later years, he was not very aware of world affairs. He usually did not go downstairs, but played mahjong with relatives and friends day and night. He also did not know the crazy rise in prices. He only played mahjong for ten yuan per bottom, and he was very pleased with himself when he won a few yuan each time. His gambling friends and the ten-yuan and five-yuan banknotes were all collected by his family, in order to comfort his loneliness in his later years.

Xiaoshi's second wife, Madam Xu Zhongyi, whose name was Xishen, died early. She was able to write poetry, and she had a "Tingqiuguan Poetry Collection." Xiaoshi wrote a preface for it and published it in the world. The preface said: "I often stayed behind to guard the place, and whenever there were matters to discuss, she would understand the key points. After the matter was settled, whenever there was leisure time, we would pick tea, brew tea, and compose poems together for pleasure..." So Zhongyi was also a talented woman of her time. In Zhongyi's collection, there is a poem in response to Xiaoshi's farewell poem to Suzhou, which contains the line "The qin and crane on one shoulder are familiar with the road home, the mist-covered snails are stacked with the sorrows of a traveler." Her style is also very good.

### Sitting at Night

— You Moruo

The streetlights are like beans, and the pen is quiet. I am still here, wearing a short coat. What can I say about this world? I have sharpened my sword for ten years, and my heart is invincible. But one night, I was surprised to find frost on my temples. The sound of crickets cannot stop entering my ears, urging the news of autumn to the neighboring garden!

### Evening Sitting in Hongkou Park

— Chen Zhongtao

After the rain, the afterglow of the sunset is beautiful in the distant sandbar, and the water lilies sway gently, sending out soft sounds. The light of the water invades the dark, whiter than snow, and the shadows of the lamps are separated by the forest, as dense as stars. The quiet environment makes me forget worldly affairs, and the autumn wind has already arrived at the park. I sit and meditate on finding poetry, and my lonely heart enters the dark and mysterious realm.

### 

Reading the newly published "China Provincial Maps" (the fourth edition was published before the war, and this is the fifth edition) in Shen Bao, I was filled with mixed emotions when I reached the page of Fujian and Taiwan. After the war, the map changes color, which is a common occurrence in history. However, we feel that the significance of Taiwan is even more profound, not just because of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, but also because it dates back to the late Ming Dynasty.

During the Ming Dynasty, the Dutch occupied Taiwan, and Zheng Chenggong drove them away, marking the first page of our Asian Han people's glorious war history against foreign powers. After occupying Taiwan, Mr. Zheng used it as a base, and even after the Ming Dynasty was destroyed and the Qing Dynasty's power spread throughout the country, he was still able to respect the Ming Dynasty's calendar and resist the Qing Dynasty for many years. Even in the early years of the Kangxi Emperor's reign, after the death of the Shunzhi Emperor, there was nothing they could do. Unfortunately, a traitor who sold his country and his master appeared in Zheng's army, Shi Lang (the father of "Lord Shi" in the Shi Gong An novels and dramas). He was originally a general of the Ming Dynasty, and was still in awe when Zheng Chenggong was alive. Later, after the main general died of illness, the young master (Zheng Jing) had a slight disagreement with him, and he actually secretly fled across the sea, surrendered to the Qing Dynasty, and "presented the map," revealing all the secrets. He also led the attack and sent Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty. Shi, the traitor, was granted the title of Qing Marquis and earned a bad name for thousands of generations.

Two hundred years after Taiwan belonged to the Qing Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty ceded it to Japan. After fifty years, it was returned to China. Summarizing the history and making a historical evaluation, its glory for the nation has three major stages: (1) Against Europe (Zheng drove away the Dutch); (2) Against the Qing (the Zheng family occupied this corner to resist, like a golden city guarding the sea and a bronze pillar touching the sky); (3) Against Japan (washing away the shame of the years 1874 and 1894-95).

The cession of Taiwan was due to the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, but the Japanese harassment and attempt to seize Taiwan dated back to 1874, twenty years before the war. At that time, it was the thirteenth year of the Qing Tongzhi Emperor (1874). Some Ryukyuans were killed in Taiwan by aborigines, which had nothing to do with Japan. However, the Japanese Saigo Takamori led warships to Taiwan and arbitrarily searched and killed people. The Qing court sent Shen Baozhen to suppress them and paid 500,000 in compensation to settle the matter, thinking it was a small matter that did not cost much, and did not care much. However, Saigo reported to his country and greatly praised his achievements, because the Qing court had tacitly acknowledged that Ryukyu belonged to Japan because the Ryukyuans were harmed and compensation was paid to Japan. The Qing court was indeed careless, and the Japanese were truly cunning.

In the next five years, the Japanese secretly invaded Ryukyu. In the fifth year of Guangxu, they openly announced the abolition of its king and changed it to Okinawa Prefecture. The Qing court suddenly woke up from a dream and quickly raised protests and sent personnel for negotiations. The Japanese spoke plausibly, delaying the decision. By the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, they even stirred up trouble in Korea and Liaodong, and forcibly demanded Taiwan after the war. At that time, Li Hongzhang even asked: "The war between the two countries is in the Northeast, what does it have to do with Taiwan?" But the Japanese were triumphant and would not allow any explanation. Who would have thought that although 1874 and 1894-95 were twenty years apart, it was just a series of tricks for them!

In August of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the Japanese announced their acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, withdrew from all the places they had invaded, and turned those old tricks into a dream!
