### The Communist Army's Pipe Dream of Entering Sichuan and Crossing the Yangtze River Ends in Vain; Joint Sichuan-Hubei Defense Becomes Increasingly Concrete

[Our Yichang Dispatch of the 22nd] This reporter has separately consulted with the military and political leaders of western and northern Hubei on the communist bandits' proclaimed plans to enter Sichuan and cross the Yangtze River. The general judgment is that under the current circumstances, with the National Army in the Central Plains suppressing the remaining bandits with a reformed deployment, the communist bandits will definitely not disperse their forces and open up another roaming area in their plans, and their own strength absolutely does not permit it. Since the National Army in the Jianghan area severely attacked the remaining bandits along the Xiang River and thoroughly destroyed their warehouses, factories, and accumulated materials, the main bandit forces in the Jianghan area, such as Li Renlin and Li Zhenqian, have crossed the Xiang River or detoured into the Dahong Mountain area. With the Yangtze River water level low this winter, there are not many concerns about the river defense. The bandit's pipe dream of entering Sichuan has never materialized. Liu Fei has always been crouching near Fangcheng in southern Henan. The National Army has deployed powerful formations in Luohe, Xinyang, Nanyang, and Xiangyang on the Pinghan Line, making it difficult for the remaining bandits to move rashly. The Kong Fei forces in Shaanxi have been fleeing to the northeast in disarray as the troops leaving Sichuan advance north and cross the Han River in pursuit. There are only a few scattered bandits in northwestern Hubei, lurking near Zhengyang, Fangxian, and Nanzhang, with weak strength, making it difficult to expect a large-scale action. The Sichuan defense is as solid as a rock. However, according to what this reporter learned in Xiangyang, the bandits have set up a large-scale cadre training class near Junxian, specializing in collecting cadres from Sichuan and Shaanxi and providing detailed instruction in the history, geography, customs, folk culture, and general social organization of Sichuan Province. The size of the organization and the strictness of the curriculum are sufficient to show that the communist bandits' dream of entering Sichuan is still difficult to dispel for the time being, and this news is also sufficient to alert military, political, and social circles.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch of the 22nd] The joint Sichuan-Hubei defense is becoming increasingly concrete. Zhu Shaoliang specially dispatched Chief of Staff Fan Songyao to fly from Chongqing to Wuhan on the 23rd to visit Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi.

### The Sufferings of the People Should Certainly Be Considered, But Current National Policies Must Be Implemented

Bai Chongxi Discusses Conscription and Grain Collection Issues

[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 22nd] Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi recently issued another statement on the issue of conscription and grain collection, stating: The goal of total war is to seek sufficient food and troops to strive for final victory, and a small number of people are actually using reducing or exempting conscription and grain collection as a slogan for their personal political activities, which greatly affects the future of bandit suppression. Mr. Bai cited that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the total amount of actual collection and purchase in the southwestern provinces was 45 million dan per year, and Sichuan Province alone could bear 24 million shi, supporting 5 million troops. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, all grain-producing areas such as Dongting, Poyang, Taihu, and Chaohu are in our hands, and we are still worried about the lack of military grain and civilian food. Is this not an abnormal phenomenon? Mr. Bai repeatedly emphasized that the hardships of the people should certainly be considered, but current national policies should be implemented, and he earnestly hopes that public opinion organs will assist in the implementation of actual collection and jointly plan for the success of the suppression.

### Regulations for Reorganizing Foreign Currency and National Currency Public Bonds; Legislators Propose Amendments, to be Discussed at Tomorrow's Legislative Yuan Regular Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold the fifth regular meeting of the second session at 9:00 AM on the 24th. A closed meeting will be held first to hear (1) reports from the President of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of National Defense, and the Chief of Staff on the Jinan war situation and the dispatch of troops for rescue, and (2) the President of the Executive Yuan's report and answers on the policies adopted by the government at the Third United Nations General Assembly, and to discuss the secret case of delimiting the undetermined border between China and Myanmar. Then the regular meeting will be opened, and the discussion items stipulated in the agenda are: (1) continuing the discussion of the Farmland Reform Bill, (2) amending the Executive Yuan's promulgated regulations for reorganizing foreign currency and national currency public bonds, (3) determining the principles for handling motions from members of this Yuan, and (4) providing relief to flood victims in various provinces and reducing or exempting farmland taxes in disaster areas.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Legislator Liu Zhendong and 88 others recently proposed to the Legislative Yuan to amend the regulations for reorganizing foreign currency and national currency public bonds promulgated by the Executive Yuan to demonstrate fairness and reduce the burden on the national treasury. The Legislative Yuan will submit the case for discussion at the regular meeting on the 24th. The case points out: The exchange rate for foreign currency (US dollar) public bonds is particularly favorable in the regulations for reorganizing public bonds promulgated by the Executive Yuan based on the emergency decree on finance and economics. On the eve of the currency change, the market price averaged more than 400,000 legal currency per yuan. Overnight, it was changed to 12 million legal currency for payment. The exchange rate for national currency (legal currency) public bonds was at most 27,000 times, that is, a public bond of 30,000 yuan in national currency was only paid one cent in gold yuan, which was far less favorable than foreign currency public bonds. It is obvious that the fairness of the matter is lost. No wonder public opinion is in an uproar and criticisms are leveled. The case also states: During the period of suppressing the rebellion, the government's finances are difficult. There is nothing wrong with the government recovering or exchanging national currency public bonds at market prices. However, the favorable repayment of foreign currency public bonds has unnecessarily increased the huge burden on the national treasury. The government must reconsider and take into account the fairness of the repayment of foreign currency and national currency public bonds, so two methods are provided: (1) The Legislative Yuan should resolve to consult the Executive Yuan to formulate fair and reasonable methods for repaying foreign currency and national currency public bonds and send them to the Yuan for review. (2) The original regulations for reorganizing foreign currency and national currency public bonds should be abolished immediately, and the procedures for repaying foreign currency and national currency public bonds should not be carried out until the new regulations are passed by the Legislative Yuan.

### Yixian Attacked by Communist Bandits in Succession, Liaoxi Great Battle Imminent, Communist Bandits in Jilin Move South to Meihekou

[Our Shenyang Dispatch of the 22nd] Communist bandits in the Northeast are on the move and brewing another harassment. The communist 6th Column, attached to an artillery brigade, moved south from the Jilin area to Meihekou. The 5th Column arrived in the area north of Qingyuan, with a situation of harassing to the southwest along the Jilin-Shenyang Road.

Furthermore, the 3rd Column is currently being transferred from Siping to Chaoyang in eastern Rehe. The great battle in Liaoxi is imminent. Also, news: the communist 1st Column infiltrated from Xinlitun towards the Daling River.

Editorial

### Properly Handling the Problem of Refugee Students

Recently, waves of refugee students have arisen in various places, especially in Nanjing. The phenomenon of refugee students flourished during the Anti-Japanese War and has spread to the present day of the suppression of the rebellion. These are our loyal next generation, and they must be properly handled. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, there were no less than a million refugee students in the rear. Fortunately, the central education authorities at the time knew that "the way to govern the people lies in ensuring their well-being," so they allocated huge amounts of money and used great efforts to set up stations for recruitment, establish schools for teaching, and implement policies and measures in an orderly and systematic manner. Everyone was able to find their place, and the sequence of education, which the nation's culture relied on and the young people's lives depended on, was able to proceed step by step, just like in normal times. Although some people criticized the education at the time for being crude and focusing on quantity over quality, looking back on it now, it is truly commendable that the country was facing great difficulties, yet learning continued without interruption and there were no student protests.

There are many reasons why refugee students during the Anti-Japanese War were able to study with peace of mind and not cause trouble. First, the Ministry of Education provided effective leadership and arrangements, and the staff were generally loyal to the country and understood the intentions of their superiors while comforting those below. Second, everyone had hatred but no resentment towards the enemy. Although every student lived in a completely refugee situation, they all looked forward to a beautiful future, hoping that the country would turn over and everyone could live like "human beings." They were psychologically prepared to endure hardships, so they were able to tolerate various unreasonable situations, and they found sweetness in all the hardships. Third, the greatest problem in the world lies not in scarcity but in inequality. At that time, everyone was poor and suffered, and officials, civilians, teachers, and students lived the same life. There were not many places of inequality, and even if there were corrupt officials and treacherous merchants who made a fortune from the national crisis, their numbers were small, and the feeling of injustice was reduced. With these three reasons, they peacefully overcame the difficulties.

After experiencing countless disasters and overcoming the line of national subjugation, we saw the restoration of our territory and the rebuilding of our rivers and mountains. Who knew that the god of victory would bring an even more pitiful fate! Old wounds had not yet healed, and new pains came again. The Communist bandits rebelled, and nine out of ten houses were empty. Every family cried, every household cried, and everyone cried! Such a restored land of rivers and mountains was depicted so tragically!

The Northeast was in urgent need, and millions of students were nervously squeezed into the corner of despair. They endured hardships and traveled into Guannei, hoping to find some warmth in the embrace of the government. Who knew that once they entered Guannei, they would run into walls everywhere, unable to get food when hungry or clothing when cold. How could they talk about studying? With each day of expectation, they felt more disappointment, and they came closer to hunger, cold, disease, and death, which ultimately led to the "July 5th" tragedy in Beiping. We do not want to investigate the responsibility for the "July 5th" incident, but we cannot help but ask: Who was responsible for the education and upbringing of refugee students in Beiping? Did the supervising officials mention this key point at all?

When Kaifeng was lost, the Central Plains were in a state of emergency, the Battle of Shandong was underway, and Xuzhou was in a tight spot. Again, millions of students had no home to return to and no school to attend. They were still living a wartime life, and their lives were soaked in tears. With sadness and emotion in their hearts, they half-walked and half-crawled to the capital. However, the education authorities were suddenly unprepared, and the students had no way to survive. They felt pain, disappointment, decadence, anxiety, depression, and helplessness in the long night. So, on the one hand, they formed begging teams, going from door to door asking for alms, but the wealthy and powerful were unkind and refused to give anything. Also, because students had impersonated others to solicit donations before, their credibility was lost, and they obtained very little. On the other hand, they demanded relief and surrounded the Ministry of Education, which suddenly became a refugee camp. Poor people have bad tempers, and there were bound to be hot-blooded actions, which made things extremely embarrassing. "People have a heart of self-preservation and are in a state of poverty and hardship, so they are all uneasy in their positions and therefore easily moved." This is by no means a coincidence.

Initially, the Ministry of Education gave each person 600,000 legal tender per day for relief. This meager amount could only buy six sesame cakes, which was not enough for a day's sustenance. However, the government had to add 4.8 billion out of thin air every day, which was also barely enough. Now, it has been changed to distributing three dou of white rice per month and 800,000 yuan of supplementary food money per day to each person, and they are housed in municipal primary and secondary schools in Beijing. The principals, together with special commissioners sent by the Ministry, are responsible for taking care of them. The Ministry of Education convened a meeting of responsible persons, and Minister Zhu attached great importance to this matter, personally guiding them and showing great care for the youth. Only then did the refugee students calm down. Unexpectedly, the students, having enough to eat and wear, began to think about watching plays. Because they had no money to go to the theater, on September 7th, the National Grand Theater was smashed for refusing to let them watch for free, leading to a city-wide theater strike. Usually, they form groups to smash public buses, rice shops, and hot water shops. According to the Beijing Daily, there have been as many as fifty large and small all-out brawls in the past two months. The day before yesterday, there was a conflict with a grocery store, resulting in a tragic incident. Yesterday, they smashed the China Daily, as if they had no books to read and the heroes had to find another place to use their skills.

Nowadays, most of the refugee students in the capital are middle school students. Some are so young that you would not believe they are middle school students, while others are as old as thirty and still call themselves middle school students. Some have even graduated and worked in society for several years but still call themselves students. With such a mixed bag, it is inevitable that there are other elements mixed in. Some have already returned to their old homes in Shandong and Henan, but they have returned to Nanjing because they have nothing to eat. It is said that many more people are coming south. It is now the season of golden winds and refreshing air, but soon the west wind will be getting stronger, and a single mat and a pair of pants will not be able to resist the cold air. Wandering far away and shrinking in a foreign land, prolonged loss of schooling is not a reasonable thing!

Seeing that the war will not end in the short term, and the longer the war lasts, the wider the war zone expands, the more refugee students will definitely flood in. This is not a small problem, so how can we lightly dismiss it? In particular, we have seen that recently, professional students have been publicly instigating student protests in various places in a planned manner, and we deeply feel that this refugee student problem is an opportunity for them to take advantage of. Whether the education authorities take appropriate measures is related to the current state of order and chaos in the country. Knowing that professional students today are trying to use young people to create student protests and tragic incidents, both to disrupt public order internally and to affect international relations externally, why still give them an "opportunity" to exploit? Doesn't this reflect the government's incompetence!

If the education authorities have the courage to face reality and the courage to improve reality, I believe that changing these phenomena will not only make a great contribution to youth education but also make a great contribution to national stability. The Ministry of Education has already formulated several measures, but the students are unwilling to leave Beijing. We believe that students in safe areas should return as soon as possible, enroll for free, and restore their student status. Various schools in war zones and dangerous non-war zones should relocate as soon as possible and implement a public funding system. In fact, schools should be productive. Japanese elementary schools were already doing this before the war, let alone middle school students and above during extraordinary times? At the same time, students should be aware of the difficulties of the times, and everyone should aspire to be a pillar of the nation, never taking blind actions.

I deeply hope that the government will do its best, society will pay more attention, and students will abide by the rules more. "It is possible to practice righteousness with a people who are at peace, but it is easy to lead a people in danger to do wrong." I pray that everyone will think about it, think deeply about it!

### Formation of the UN General Committee; Meeting Held Yesterday to Discuss the Agenda; General Debate of the Assembly to Begin Tomorrow; Five Permanent Members and Mexico, Poland, and Other Seven Countries Elected as Vice-Presidents of the Assembly

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] The election of various bodies of the UN General Assembly was completed on the 22nd. The Soviet Union and its satellite states only won two seats in the fourteen-seat important General Committee. Due to the importance of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries in terms of status and population, as one of the largest groups in the General Assembly, this restriction, with so few elected to the administrative positions of the Assembly, proves that the Soviet Union's world policy has been severely rebuffed. Before the meeting on the 22nd, which was scheduled to begin at 10:45 AM, the Soviet Union had some complaints. Vyshinsky was expected to speak and denounce the West in the hall, but he missed the opportunity. The General Committee is scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM to discuss the agenda. The general debate will begin on the 24th.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] China received the most votes in the election of vice-presidents of the United Nations General Assembly this morning.

Therefore, the seven vice-presidents elected were China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Mexico, and Poland. The Philippines failed to be elected.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] The United Nations General Assembly opened today. The provisional chairman and the French President delivered speeches praising the lofty principles of politics and calling on humanity and its leaders to seek greater political morality and wisdom. Following the rules of the first General Assembly, the new President of this General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, was elected. Evatt's acceptance speech as President of the Assembly was very brief. He stated, "Only the United Nations is the hope for peace, and a huge responsibility rests on the shoulders of all representatives. The spirit of the Assembly must provide guidance to the troubled world." The election of the chairmen of the six main committees was as follows: Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak was elected Chairman of the most important Political and Security Committee with 48 votes, an absolute majority. The Polish representative, Lang, supported by the Soviet Union, received only 7 votes. Chilean representative Cruz was elected Chairman of the Economic and Financial Committee; Syrian representative Curry was elected Chairman of the Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee; Iranian representative Antecham was elected Chairman of the Trusteeship Committee; Canadian representative Vilgris was elected Chairman of the Administrative and Budget Committee; and Panamanian representative Alfala was elected Chairman of the Legal Committee.

[United Press, Paris, 21st] All representatives of the United Nations General Assembly stood in silence for one minute on the 21st to commemorate Count Bernadotte, the United Nations mediator who died in the line of duty in Palestine, and his French assistant, Colonel Serot. UN Secretary-General Lie delivered a six-hundred-word eulogy, praising the two men.

### British Foreign Secretary Delivers Foreign Policy Statement in the House of Commons; Maintains Firm Position on the German Question; Britain and France Both Support Bernadotte's Proposals

[Our Report] Paris Radio 22nd: Britain, the United States, and France plan to submit the Berlin crisis to the General Assembly for discussion. Due to France's insistence on re-notifying the Soviet Union to achieve the purpose of lifting the blockade, the submission has been delayed. After two meetings between the three foreign ministers, France suggested issuing a final notification to the Soviet Union, stating that if the blockade is not lifted, the Western countries will resolve to submit the case to the General Assembly.

[Our Report] London Radio 22nd: British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered his important foreign policy statement in the House of Commons. He first mentioned the situation in Palestine, praising Bernadotte highly and stating, "To commemorate his achievements, Britain should accept his proposals as the basis for resolving the Palestine issue. We further hope that the United Nations will fully support this proposal."

Bevin continued to discuss the German issue. Regarding the currency issue, he said that under the principle of joint control by the four countries, "We still intend to recognize the Soviet Mark as the sole currency." Regarding the Berlin blockade, Bevin said that the Western powers are prepared to continue the airlift throughout the winter to resist the Soviet blockade. Regarding the situation of the Moscow talks, Bevin said that it has not yet reached the point where it can be announced and is still under discussion. He stated, "We believe that lifting the Berlin blockade is a necessary condition, and any solution must be based on this." Bevin continued, saying that rumors that Britain, the United States, and France cannot agree are absolutely untrue, and we have always been consistent in any policy steps.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] The French cabinet convened a meeting this morning under the chairmanship of President Orelio and passed Bernadotte's report on the situation in Palestine, believing that the report can be used as an appropriate basis for negotiations. Foreign Minister Schumann also reported on the world situation at the cabinet meeting.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] The three Western powers' representatives to the Soviet Union, Smith, Roberts, and Chatelot, arrived in France by plane from Moscow via Berlin and landed at the Orly Airport in Paris this morning.

### Biographical Sketch of Evatt, Chairman of the Current UN General Assembly

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, who was elected the new president of the General Assembly, is 54 years old.

He later resigned from his position as a judge and was elected to Parliament. During the war, he served as the chairman of the Reconstruction Committee. Since 1946, he has served as the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Australia. Since then, all important international conferences have been attended by Evatt on behalf of Australia. In previous meetings, he has always insisted on protecting the interests of "small countries".

### Special Report from the Meeting Place

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] When the UN General Assembly opened today, there were no large crowds waiting for the arrival of the delegates from various countries. Only a few small groups stood in the Trocatro Square in front of the main entrance of the Charle Palace, giving gentle cheers to the important people who arrived in large cars flying different flags. Soviet representative Vyshinsky arrived first with a smile, his glasses reflecting the sunlight. Next, US Secretary of State Marshall arrived, looking worried and drawing much attention. Then British Foreign Secretary Bevin appeared before the crowd with a robust appearance, followed by French Foreign Minister Schumann and Mrs. Roosevelt. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie was one of the last to arrive. The hall was filled with 1,350 guests, including 450 newspaper reporters, who arrived half an hour before the meeting to view the newly decorated hall. The hall is equipped with a small mechanism that simultaneously translates the speakers' words into the five official languages of the conference. Behind the chairman's platform, the flags of the 58 member states are displayed. The UN emblem, a globe, with ears of wheat on either side, is placed in the center. On each side, the flags of 29 countries are spread out, dazzling when viewed from below.

### The Position of Our UN General Assembly Representatives: Agreeing to the Establishment of a UN Security Guard and Limiting the Scope of Use of the Veto Power

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] This Central News Agency reporter learned from people close to the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly that, after long deliberation, our country's policy has been established regarding the five Asian issues and three global issues at this General Assembly. The Asian issues are: (1) the Korean issue, (2) the Palestine issue, (3) the issue of Indian treatment in South Africa, (4) the issue that the Security Council should pay more attention to the vast region of Asia and give Asian countries seats when selecting non-permanent directors; (5) the issue of the Far East Economic Committee. Regarding the Korean issue, our country's policy is to support an independent, unified, and legitimate government; regarding the Palestine issue, our country's policy is to support the principles of justice and peace and the specific measures of "peace and compromise" formulated to achieve these principles. Our country also sincerely hopes that Indians in South Africa can enjoy better treatment, and also hopes that Asian countries can be elected as non-permanent directors of the Security Council. The three global issues are: (1) the necessity of establishing a UN Security Guard, (2) appropriately limiting the scope of use of the veto power; (3) reaching an agreement quickly on the atomic energy issue.

Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi did not elaborate on this before thoroughly studying the report submitted by Bernadotte to the United Nations.

However, government officials indicated that the Arabs would oppose Bernadotte's proposal and would continue to fight to maintain the Arab state of Palestine. Arab League leader Azam told the Al-Amisri newspaper: "The attitude adopted by the Arab countries is to unanimously oppose any attempt to harm the Arabs of the Holy Land." He stated that the Arab side has never changed its position since Bernadotte made his first proposal, and will oppose all of Bernadotte's plans.

### Puppet Emperor Puyi Still Detained by Soviets; Spends Days Carving Bamboo to Pass the Time

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] According to a Japanese source who returned from the Soviet Union, Puyi is currently imprisoned in a two-story building in Boli (Khabarovsk), located about 400 miles north of Vladivostok. More than 200 former Japanese Kwantung Army officers are also imprisoned in the same location. The place of imprisonment used to be a second-class hotel.

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] Former Manchukuo Emperor Puyi and about 200 of his subordinates are still being detained by the Soviet Union in a second-class hotel in Khabarovsk. This information was revealed by Japanese people who recently returned from the Soviet Union. Former Japanese Colonel Yanagida Hidenaga provided detailed descriptions of Puyi's imprisonment, but knew nothing about the Soviet Union's plans for the puppet emperor. Puyi's younger brother, Pujie, and his puppet premier, Zhang Jinghui, also live in the two-story hotel. They must work and spend their days reading, taking walks, playing mahjong, and playing Go to pass the time. Puyi spends his days carving bamboo to pass the time. The puppet emperor receives preferential treatment, with a room to himself, and his food rations are also better than others. Today, most observers do not believe that the Soviet Union intends to reuse Puyi, as such a move would be too blatant, and he has already been criticized as being "available for anyone to use." So far, the Soviet Union has not exploited him or used him to negotiate with the Chinese government. However, the Soviet Union has not unexpectedly prosecuted Puyi as a war criminal, so this puppet emperor remains a mystery in the East.

### Soviets Want Communist Party to Seize Power, Hence Propose Withdrawal of Western Occupation Forces: U.S. Officials Explain Soviet Strategy of Recommending Troop Withdrawal

[United Press, Washington, 21st Dispatch] U.S. officials on the 21st explained that the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw all Allied occupation forces from Germany, Japan, and Korea is a strategy to allow the Communist Party to do whatever it wants in Europe and the Far East. It is also believed here that the Soviet Union's proposal aims to trouble the Western Allies before the United Nations General Assembly. Officials said that completely withdrawing the Western occupation forces during this period would remove the main obstacle for the Communist Party to seize power on both ends of the world.

[United Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 21st Dispatch] Representative Judd said on the 21st that "We predicted a year ago that the Soviet Union would announce the withdrawal of its troops stationed in Korea. The Soviet Union's actions are purely propaganda to harm the United States. This will be similar to the Soviet troop withdrawal from Poland and Bulgaria, where Communist Party members occupy key positions in the government and military, and their policies are controlled by Moscow."

### Rumor That the Soviet Union Convened Satellite States for Important Secret Meeting

[Report from this newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcast: According to reports from several national capitals, several leaders of satellite states have left their countries. It is reported that a certain Eastern European leader is also vacationing in the Soviet Union. It is generally speculated that other key figures in the Soviet bloc may also be there, either to attend a meeting of the Communist International Information Bureau or to hold a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. However, according to responsible officials, the above information has not been confirmed. Whether or not Communist Party officials are meeting is unknown, but major Soviet actions often unfold after secret meetings, so the world is extremely concerned about this.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcast: Western newspapers in Berlin reported that Berlin Communist Party leaders and the Soviet occupation authorities in Germany are scheduled to hold a secret meeting on the 24th to discuss new steps to deal with the Berlin issue. The meeting will be held in Potsdam, where the Soviet military headquarters in Berlin is located, and the agenda and other preparations are being kept strictly secret.

### Resolution of the Arab-Jewish Conflict in Palestine: Full Text of Bernadotte's Recommendations; Arab-Jewish Partition Establishes Lasting Peace

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 22nd Dispatch] The full text of Bernadotte's report conclusion is as follows: "Since delivering written recommendations to the Arab and Jewish authorities on June 27, I have not formally presented any concrete recommendations regarding the resolution of the problem to either side. Since that time, I have held multiple meetings with both sides in Arab capitals and Tel Aviv, during which we freely exchanged views on solutions to the dispute. My original recommendation provided a general scope within which the two sides could, if willing to negotiate, find a reasonable and feasible solution. However, both sides have rejected this recommendation. When presenting this recommendation, it was clear that this recommendation was purely exploratory in nature, its main purpose being to solicit the intentions and suggestions of both sides, and in any case, the realization of this recommendation must be agreed upon by both sides, so I never used pressure to promote its realization. I have a clear understanding of a certain basic concept in the recommendation. No matter how necessary the political and economic union of Palestine is, the timing for the realization of this plan has not yet arrived. I have no authority to recommend any action by member states of the United Nations to resolve the Palestine problem. I believe that I have no right to make recommendations to member states of the United Nations. This is the responsibility that member states should bear through appropriate mechanisms. As the current United Nations mediator, I should seek information and draw conclusions from experience, which will be helpful for member states of the United Nations when deciding on actions related to the Palestine problem. Therefore, my responsibility is to enable member states of the United Nations to learn from this report the content of several peaceful solutions. The formulation of this method is based on frequent consultations with Arab and Jewish authorities over the past three and a half months, as well as my observations on the current situation in Palestine. I do not believe that this conclusion can be used as the basis for a recommendation that will be immediately agreed upon by the relevant parties. In my active efforts to seek Arab-Jewish common agreement, I have not yet been able to disturb this plan. I firmly believe that if the recommendations put forward at this time can be adopted by the General Assembly and given strong support, the Arab and Jewish parties will not firmly reject them. I also firmly believe that the Security Council will uphold its resolution of July 15 to cease military action by both sides. There is one point that cannot be ignored, that is, the current situation is very different from that of last November. In these months, the war began and then stopped, and decisive events also occurred during this period. My conclusions are based on the following seven basic premises:

Restoration of Peace (A) Peace must be restored in Palestine, and all possible measures should be taken to ensure that war does not break out again, and that harmonious relations are finally restored between Arabs and Jews.

Jewish State (B) There is no sound reason to assume that the Jewish state named Israel will not continue to exist in Palestine.

Boundary Determination (C) The boundaries of this new country must be finally determined by formal agreement by the parties concerned, or by the United Nations.

Continuous Boundary (D) The main objective of the boundary agreement should be to comply with the principle of geographical unity and integrity. This principle should be equally applied to Arab and Jewish territories. Therefore, the territories of the two countries should not be strictly regulated by the territorial agreement stipulated in the resolution of September 29.

Right to Repatriation (E) The innocent people who have been displaced by the terror and ravages of the current war should have the right to be repatriated. Those who do not wish to return should be guaranteed appropriate compensation for their lost property.

Jerusalem (F) The city of Jerusalem, due to its importance in religion and internationally, and the complexity of its various interests, should be treated separately and specially.

International Responsibility (G) International responsibility, when necessary, should be expressed in the form of international guarantees, so as to alleviate existing fears, especially those concerning borders and human rights.

Affirmative Conclusions The following conclusions are broad outlines. In my opinion, these conclusions, in the context of the full text, are sufficient to provide a reasonable, fair and feasible basis for resolution: (A) Since the Security Council has prohibited the use of force in Palestine as a means of resolving disputes, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter concerning sanctions, the parties concerned should formally declare the outcome of the conflict in a manner mutually agreed upon. Otherwise, it should be formally declared by the United Nations. The current indefinite ceasefire should be replaced by formal peace, or at least by a truce, which should stipulate the complete withdrawal and demobilization of armed forces, or the establishment of a broad demilitarized zone under United Nations supervision as a separation. (B) The boundary line between Arab and Jewish territories, in the absence of an agreement between Arabs and Jews, should be determined by the United Nations, and the United Nations should appoint a technical boundary committee to carry out the boundary demarcation work. The committee should be responsible to the United Nations. (To be continued)

### Twelve Underground Banks Uncovered, Ordered to Cease Operations and Fined Separately: Financial Control Bureau Reports to Economic Control Supervisors for Approval and Implementation

[Report from this newspaper] After cracking down on four banks in this city, the Financial Control Bureau (ÈáëÁÆ°Â±Ä) has concentrated its efforts on eliminating black market transactions of underground banks. A few days ago, it dispatched 30 staff members, divided into 15 groups, to conduct large-scale surprise inspections of underground banks in conjunction with the police bureau. More than a dozen locations were uncovered, and a large number of account books and documents were seized. After days of review, the details have been clarified. The Bureau yesterday ordered twelve underground banks to cease operations, and fined them separately according to the severity of their circumstances, and reported to the Economic Control Supervisor for approval and implementation. The illegal business activities of each bank are recorded as follows:

(1) Youlian Trading Company (ÂèãËÅØË≤øÊòìÂÖ¨Âè∏): It was found that the company's head office is located in Hankou, and branch offices are located in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhu and other places. Wuhu drafts were found in the documents. The Shanghai branch also engaged in deposit, remittance, and arbitrage businesses. (2) Luo Xiangji (ÁæÖË±°Ë®ò): This firm handles the transport of cloth pieces for Wuhu merchants. It has not been formally registered with the competent authority, which is already inconsistent with regulations. It was also found to have more than a dozen deposit accounts, calculating deposit and loan interest, and also engaging in Wuhu remittance ticket discounting and lending businesses. (3) Tongxing Pawnshop (ÂêåËààÁï∂Â∫ó): It was found to be colluding with commercial firms in Wuhu and other places to engage in remittance and collection, and to absorb deposits, which was admitted without denial. (4) Baogengfeng Grain Store (ÂØ∂Â∫öË±êÁ≥ßÈ£üËôü): This store absorbed deposits from eleven accounts, and colluded with cooperatives and stores in Wuhu, Jingzhen, and other places to engage in remittance business. (5) Runchang Han Cotton Cloth Store (ÊΩ§ÊòåÊº¢Ê£âÂ∏ÉËôü): This store was originally a money shop before the war, and still secretly engaged in absorbing deposits after the victory, and colluded with pawnshops in Wuhu Danyang and cooperatives in Jingzhen and other places to handle remittance business. (6) Shengmao (Áî°ËåÇËôü): The responsible person of this firm is a friend of the responsible person of Runchang Han, and the operations are the same as those of Runchang Han. (7) Hu Huanji Shen Zhuang (ËÉ°ÁÖ•Ë®òÁî≥Ëéä): This firm is located at the original site of Dahua Silk Store (Â§ßËèØÁ∂¢Ëéä), absorbed deposits, with 29 accounts including Zhao Hongji (Ë∂ôÈ¥ªË®ò), all of which received and paid interest, and colluded with cooperatives and stores in Wuhu to handle remittance collection. (8) Hong Dachang (È¥ªÂ§ßÊòåËôü): This firm absorbed deposits, with 29 accounts including Yongji („ÄÄÊ∞∏Ë®ò), the interest paid exceeded that of general firms, and also handled remittances to Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, and other places. (9) Zheng Shou'er (ÈÑ≠Â£ΩËÄ≥): Documents were found indicating that he was engaged in remittance, acting as an agent for Wuhu money shops to collect and remit funds, and calculating interest on a regular basis. Zheng Shoushan submitted a guarantee admitting to the task of processing and forwarding, and the so-called forwarding is actually a disguised form of remittance. (10) Yin Jingyuan (Â∞πÈùúÂúí): Absorbed deposits, opened Xu Youji (ÂæêÊúâË®ò) account at Jianye Bank (Âª∫Ê•≠ÈäÄË°å), and seven accounts including Fan Jikang (Áï™Â≠£Â∫∑) at Fuchang Bank (Á¶èÊòåÈäÄËôü). Although it was claimed that they were deposits from relatives, it is a fact that Yin Jingyuan handled the absorption of deposits, and regularly remitted funds for 26 cooperatives in Wuhu and Zhenjiang and other places. (11) Li Fengchang (ÊùéÈ≥≥Êòå): Colluded with Hu Huanji Shen Zhuang and others to handle remittance business for cooperatives and stores in Wuhu, Zhenjiang and other places. (12) Yuan Shaode (Ë¢ÅÁ¥πÂæ∑): Colluded with money shops and cooperatives in Wuhu, Jingzhen and other places to handle remittance business.

### Several Other Businesses Exceeded the Scope of Their Business

The above twelve firms absorbed deposits, handled lending, and engaged in remittance. The evidence is solid. There is no doubt that they are operating underground banks. It is confirmed that they have violated Article 15 of the Banking Law, and the Financial Control Bureau will impose penalties according to the same article of the same law. Among them, Youlian and Luo Xiangji are more serious. The Bureau has notified the municipal government to order them to cease operations, and fined their responsible persons 5,000 yuan each. The remaining six firms, Tongxing Pawnshop, Baogengfeng Grain Store, Runchang Han Cotton Cloth Store, Shengmao, Hu Huanji Shen Zhuang, and Hong Dachang, have been notified by the Bureau to the municipal government to order them to cease operations, and fined their responsible persons 3,000 yuan each. Zheng Shoushan, Yin Jingyuan, Li Fengchang, and Yuan Shaode, have no registered names, and the Bureau has notified the municipal government to order the four to immediately cease their underground banking business, submit a written guarantee, and fined them 3,000 yuan each. In addition, although it was found that Zhengtai (Ê≠£Ê≥∞Ëôü) had no underground banking business, it did engage in buying and selling yarn and cloth for customers, transferring funds, and receiving and paying interest, which also exceeded the scope of its business. The Bureau has notified the municipal government to instruct the firm to submit a written guarantee that the same situation will not occur in the future. The collusion between Hexiang Trust Company (ÂíåÁ••‰ø°Ë®óÂÖ¨Âè∏) and underground banks in other locations will be reported to the Ministry of Finance for discussion. It was found that the transaction funds of Ning Songji (ÂØóÊùæË®ò) are all within the scope of the company's business, and there is no sign of underground banking business, so it should be exempted from discussion. Yongye Company (Ê∞∏Ê•≠ÂÖ¨Âè∏) is still under detailed investigation.

### The Financial Control Bureau Advises People Not to Be Lured by High Profits

Regarding the punishment of underground banks this time, according to Director Lin of the Bureau, the establishment of underground banks is due to the abnormal economic and financial situation. People seek high profits and are willing to deposit or entrust the money earned from their blood and sweat to illegal hands, which has led to a chaotic situation. Today, management work has been effective, and financial business is gradually on the right track. Illegal organizations will inevitably be eliminated. It is hoped that people will no longer be tempted by higher interest rates, and will risk depositing in underground banks, so that their principal and interest are not guaranteed. They must do business with legal firms, which will not only ensure the safety of their own assets, but also greatly help the future of economic management.

### Violation of the Exchange Act: Four Defendants Tried and Awaiting Judgment: Zeng Chuan Police Already Original Handling Officer Testified

[Report from this newspaper] The case of stockbroker Lin Legeng and Du Weiping, Tao Liguolan, Xu Yangshuyao, and others being accused of violating the Exchange Act was heard again in the second court of the district court yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM by Chief Judge Shen Tianbao and Assessors Mei Erhe and Fang Xianghai. After the final defense, the judgment was scheduled to be announced at 10:00 AM on the 28th of this month.

When the court opened yesterday, the court summoned Hu Zengda, an employee of Hongxing Securities (È¥ªËààË≠âÂà∏Ëôü), Shen Shuren, an employee of Huamei Industrial Trading Company (ËèØÁæéÂ∑•Ê•≠Ë≤øÊòìÂÖ¨Âè∏), and Lou Chenghan, the original handling officer of the police bureau's intelligence group, and Wang Sizu, the action group leader, to appear in court to testify.

No Other Evidence Except Chalkboard and Other Items

According to Wang Sizu, he was ordered to investigate the off-exchange transactions of the defendants in this case. Regarding Du Weiping, 29 million shares were dumped one after another, but there were no transaction orders or accounts to verify, which was an off-exchange transaction. Huamei is a trading company, and Du is the general manager. The police bureau, the garrison headquarters, and the financial control bureau dispatched personnel and found that Huamei was equipped with a chalkboard, loudspeaker, telephone, and other securities company equipment, and the windows were marked with the words "Police Out" and "Settlement." Later, two employees of the company also admitted that Huamei had off-exchange transactions. Regarding Lin Legeng, the investigation first focused on short selling, and then it was discovered that Lin Legeng, an employee of the broker number 190, bought 16 million shares on August 16 and 17, all of which were off-exchange transactions. Tao Liguolan and Xu Yangshuyao confessed to the bureau that they and Li Boqin, who is on the run, dumped 7 million shares in Huamei on the 19th, and there were no accounts to verify. As for the written record of the confession, a copy was sent to the district court, and the original is still stored in the police bureau. Finally, in response to the inquiry from Du's defense lawyer, he said that no other suspected evidence was found in Huamei except for the chalkboard and other items.

Hu Zengda Testified That He Did Not Know About Dumping Shares

Next, Lou Chenghan stated that the police bureau was ordered by the Presidential Office to investigate the "Dumping Shares Case" within a time limit. After investigating with various parties, it was believed that Du and Lin were suspected. When Du and Lin were summoned on September 2, personnel from all parties jointly interrogated them, and he was responsible for recording the proceedings. The first draft was recorded in shorthand, and then reread once. Du and Lin had no objections. Later, the first draft was deemed to be too messy, so it was reorganized. When the reorganized confession was reread during the second summons that afternoon, the phrase "off-exchange transaction" was crossed out. Qiu Yuntiao, the manager of Hongxing Securities, who was summoned to court last time, did not arrive, so Hu Zengjian, an employee of the firm, was summoned. He stated that he was 27 years old and had been an apprentice in Hongxing for three or four months. He listened to market quotations and wrote on the chalkboard every day, and did not understand the procedures for buying and selling. On the 19th, Manager Qiu ordered him to sell one million shares, but he returned unsuccessful because the market quotation plummeted at that time. He replied that he did not know about dumping 16 million shares.

Huamei Does Not Do Stock Business

Subsequently, Shen Shuren, an employee of Huamei, testified that he was 18 years old and worked in Huamei as a general affairs employee. Huamei originally engaged in the import and export of electrical appliances and automobiles, etc., but has now ceased operations. Hongxing and Huamei are both operated by Du. Hongxing did not have a suitable location before, so it planned to move to Huamei to open a branch. It had already moved the chalkboard and other items to Huamei. Later, Hongxing rented Room 501 in the Securities Building, so the plan to move was cancelled. The chalkboard and other items seized by the police bureau in Huamei were originally intended to be used for the establishment of the Hongxing branch. Huamei does not do stock business. At 9:20 AM on the 19th, Li Boqin brought two women to Huamei to borrow a phone to call Hongxing to dump shares. Later, a worker from Hongxing brought the money to Huamei and handed it to Li Boqin. He personally does not do stock business. The court then summoned the defendants. Lin Legeng stated that he bought 16 million shares from Manager Qiu of Hongxing on August 16 and 17. Because the capital was not sufficient, he cancelled the transaction immediately, and never bought or sold again, let alone shorted.

Off-Exchange Transactions - Completely Unaware

Tao Liguolan stated that she dumped 2 million shares on the morning of the 19th, and then made up for it near noon. Because it was entrusted to a broker, she did not know whether it was an off-exchange transaction. Xu Yangshuyao stated that she was a spot trader, not short selling. She also did not understand what short selling was. Zhu had done stock business before. The remaining testimonies of Li and Yang were the same as the last time. Finally, Du Weiping stated that he only went to the police bureau to supplement the written record of the confession, and had not reviewed the rest. He could not be responsible for the confession made by the police bureau. If there were off-exchange transactions, he was completely unaware of them. He had never met the other defendants, and did not know anything about the dumping of shares. Qiu Yunfeng has repeatedly failed to appear in court, or may be fleeing the crime. After the confession, the court questioned each defendant again, and then the prosecutor, Ding Tongjun, briefly stated the intention of the prosecution. The lawyers of each defendant then debated one after another, starting at 3:30 PM. The debate ended at 5:15 PM, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the 28th. The defendants' request for bail was denied, and they were ordered to be returned to custody.

Xu Yangshuyao Sobbed Uncontrollably

When the court opened yesterday, Du had sores on his legs. He underwent surgery in the detention center a few days ago and had difficulty moving. When he walked from the waiting room to the defendant's bar, he was supported by Lin Legeng. The court specially granted him a seat. He was in good spirits. Xu Yangshuyao changed to a white-bottomed, large red floral cheongsam, and she and Tao Liguolan were barefoot, wearing the same style of round-mouthed black embroidered shoes. Because Yang was pregnant, she was also granted a seat by the court to rest after being questioned. Later, when her defense lawyer, Ru Baoyi, told the court about her "family ruin" and life story, she could not help but feel sad and sobbed uncontrollably. More than 100 family members of the defendants attended the hearing, not as crowded as the first hearing. After the adjournment, they left one after another in the pouring rain.

### New Developments in the Zhan Peilin Case: Another 500 Reams of Newspaper Seized

The Investigation is Completed, and a Public Prosecution Will Be Filed Soon

[Report from this newspaper] Zhan Peilin, the chairman of the Paper Industry Association, is currently detained in the Special Criminal Court for investigation due to a hoarding case. He was questioned by the prosecutor yesterday morning. It is reported that there have been new developments in the case recently. According to the investigation by the police bureau, in addition to the previously discovered hoarding, 500 reams of white newspaper secretly stored by Zhan have been seized. Since the hoarded materials have been broken down into smaller amounts, there may be other secret storage locations. The police bureau has sent a letter to the Special Court for investigation. According to Zhan's confession yesterday: "The 500 reams of white newspaper are indeed mine, but they are all substandard products." The prosecutor then asked if there was any other hoarding? Zhan insisted that all had been seized. After the interrogation, he was still returned to custody. It is reported that the investigation part of the case has been completed, and a public prosecution will be filed in the coming days.

### Chiang Ching-kuo Summons Wan Molin and Li Ming

[Our Newspaper] Due to disrupted rice supply channels, the price of rice reached the limit yesterday, with scarce transactions in the market. Supervisor Chiang is highly concerned about this issue. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, he specially instructed Cheng Yi-kuan, captain of the Economic Inspection Brigade, and Lou Cheng-han, leader of the Intelligence Group, to invite Wan Molin, chairman of the Rice Industry Association of this city, to the Supervisor's office for discussions. Wan arrived at the Central Bank at 6:00 PM and waited in the waiting room. At 6:50 PM, accompanied by Cheng Yi-kuan, he met with Chiang Ching-kuo. He hastily departed five minutes later. It is generally speculated that the authorities have tasked him with stabilizing rice prices. If the price surge is not suppressed or the supply is not sustained, Wan will be held responsible. Furthermore, Li Ming, chairman of the Banking Association of this city, was also invited yesterday to report on the transfer of foreign exchange assets of banks and financial institutions.

### Scalpers Drill Through Any Crack: Falsely Establishing Businesses to Obtain Subsidized Cigarettes for Profit; Social Affairs Bureau Strictly Reviews Applications

[Our Newspaper] There is a shortage of cigarettes in this city. Since the cigarette companies started distributing goods at limited prices, it has attracted the attention of scalpers. They are falsely establishing businesses, even setting up small stalls, and applying for registration with the Social Affairs Bureau to obtain subsidized cigarettes for profit. In recent days, the Business Registration Office of the Social Affairs Bureau has been bustling with activity, with many scalpers mixed in, going through registration procedures. The Social Affairs Bureau, aware of the malpractice, is strictly reviewing applications for business registration to prevent scalpers from speculating. Newly established cigarette businesses must have sufficient capital and guarantees from two members of the Cigarette Association, with seals to prove their legitimacy, before they can apply for registration. Established cigarette businesses must have a special business license from the Finance Bureau and business tax receipts for April to June of the 37th year, which must be certified by the Social Affairs Bureau before they can apply for subsidized goods.

### Shortage of Western Medicine Due Again to Scalpers

[Our Newspaper] Recently, there has been a shortage of Western medicine in the city, making it difficult to purchase at retail stores, even affecting the diagnosis and treatment work of hospitals. Yesterday, the reporter met with Cheng Yi-kuan, captain of the Economic Inspection Brigade, to inquire whether the shortage of Western medicine was due to hoarding by pharmacies. According to Cheng, the main reason for not being able to buy Western medicine is likely a shortage of goods, not hoarding by pharmacies. Especially for large-scale pharmacies, hoarding behavior would be easily detected. Recently, it was discovered that a major Chinese pharmacy in this city had a large batch of goods stored in a warehouse, but after investigation, it was found that they were all tonics rather than special medicines. I believe that a large number of Western medicines in this city are likely in the hands of scalpers, sold on the black market, where they can fetch about double the limited price, and the high profits attract them like moths to a flame.

### Municipal Police Arrest Scalpers at Department Store

### Revision of Measures for Handling Enemy and Puppet Houses and Real Estate: Occupants Still Allowed Priority Purchase

[Nanjing, 22nd (Our Dispatch)] Economic Supervisor of the Shanghai Region, Yu Hongjun, and others were instructed by Presidential Decree to expedite the handling of enemy and puppet real estate. They have recently drafted revised measures for handling enemy and puppet houses and real estate and submitted them to the Executive Yuan via telegram. The telegram stated briefly: These real properties are currently occupied. The measures previously issued by the Executive Yuan originally allowed occupants priority purchase. However, due to the rapid depreciation of currency, the valuation and collection time was lengthy, causing significant losses to the government, so it was changed to a uniform auction. However, due to the severe housing shortage, it was inconvenient to proceed. Now that the currency system has been reformed and the currency value is stable, it is proposed to revise the measures as follows: (1) Valuation will be based on the market value, plus 10%; occupants will be notified to purchase within ten days, first paying half of the security deposit, with the remainder to be paid in full within one month from the date of notification. Failure to pay within the deadline will result in forfeiture of the security deposit. Failure to purchase within ten days will be considered a waiver, and the property will be publicly tendered, with occupants still allowed to participate in the bidding. (2) Once the property is sold at auction, occupants must move out within one month to allow delivery to the successful bidder; violators will be forcibly evicted by the Economic Supervisor's office. These measures will be implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan.

However, the Land Bureau has not yet processed the requisition procedures. The owners of the land appointed Chen Weihan, Li Xiangzhou, Lu Chunming, and five others as representatives yesterday to submit a petition to the Municipal Council, raising five demands, requesting that the real situation be considered and that the relevant authorities be informed to handle it quickly and effectively.

### Funds for Recovering the Racecourse Should Be Raised Independently: Instruction from the Executive Yuan Arrives in Shanghai

Regarding the case of recovering the racecourse on Xizang Road, the Municipal Government originally intended to exchange it with the original owner by confiscating the state-owned enemy and puppet property, the Jiangwan Racecourse. However, this enemy property was approved by the Executive Yuan to be sold to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Joint Logistics Command, so the case was shelved midway. The Municipal Council, based on the resolutions of the Sixth and Seventh Congresses, successively petitioned the Executive Yuan to revoke the order to sell the Jiangwan Racecourse and requested that the original proposal to exchange the Jiangwan Racecourse for the racecourse on Xizang Road be maintained. It is now known that after reviewing these suggestions, the Executive Yuan deemed it inappropriate to approve them and instructed the Municipal Government yesterday, stating briefly: "If it is necessary to recover the racecourse on Xizang Road for municipal construction, funds should be raised independently to purchase it; the enemy and puppet property that has already been confiscated and nationalized should not be used for exchange."

### Shanghai Youth Service Corps Training Begins Yesterday: Chiang Ching-kuo Delivers Encouraging Speech

[Our Newspaper] The training of the Shanghai Youth Service Corps cadres began yesterday. A total of 500 cadres and members attended the opening ceremony in Jiangwan in the morning. Chiang Ching-kuo attended and delivered a speech, encouraging the youth of the corps to illuminate the dark world with the torch of justice. He also stated that today's economic policy of the government is not satisfied with inspecting warehouses and stabilizing prices. This is only a means to achieve the goal, not the goal itself. Our goal is to create a new society of the Three Principles of the People that young people idealize. In this society, there is no exploitation, no oppression, no fraud, and no unreasonable phenomena. Everyone enjoys a free and happy life. He then said that if we engage in this work today, we will surely gain the support of the broad masses of the people, because we have nothing and seek nothing. We have no industry, no land, except for a healthy body, wisdom, and determination, so we should work without any scruples. At the same time, we strive only for the happiness of the country and the people, not for promotion or wealth, so we have nothing to fear. At this point, he encouraged the youth to be humble and calm with a sincere attitude, and criticized arrogance, complacency, decadence, and corruption. He also said that determination is the source of strength. We should act like an army fighting a war. The gain or loss of a city or a piece of land is not enough to determine the overall battle situation, but we should carry out our mission with the determination to hold on to the last fortress. Finally, he said in the most touching tone: "I can swear to you today that if I have the slightest bit of corruption, you can all shoot me with your guns."

Group Discussions

After Chiang's speech, group discussions were held on the topic of "The Prospect of New Shanghai." There were three conclusions: (1) Evils of Old Shanghai: A. The economy controlled by profiteers deprives most people of happiness. B. The politics controlled by bureaucrats deprives most people of their rights. C. The society controlled by gangsters deprives most people of their freedom. (2) Outline of New Shanghai: A. New Shanghai belongs to the common people. B. The politics of New Shanghai should be everyone abiding by the law, stability everywhere, and freedom for all. C. The economy of New Shanghai should be everyone having clothes to wear, food to eat, houses to live in, and work to do, with capital invested in production, production matching consumption, and consumption adapting to national wealth. D. The society of New Shanghai should be the majority suppressing the minority, the good defeating the violent, and the people suppressing the bureaucrats. (3) The transformation of Shanghai and the great reform of China require the revolutionary youth of all of Shanghai and all of China to unite, stand with the people, and strive for happiness and freedom for the vast number of poor and suffering people with their blood and lives. The organization of the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps is a revolutionary social movement for this purpose.

[Another Dispatch] Thousands of college students from Chongqing, Hangzhou, Hankou, Peiping, and other places responded to Chiang Ching-kuo's call and sent letters to the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps yesterday, expressing that similar organizations will be established in various places and supporting this social movement.

### Real Estate Transactions Becoming More Active: Demand for One or Two Mu of Vacant Land Is Strongest

[Our Newspaper] Real estate transactions in this city have become more active in the past week. According to industry insiders, transactions of vacant land account for the majority, followed by the sale of vacant houses. Transactions of occupied real estate remain sluggish, and prices are also weak. According to investigations, the number of transfer cases at the Land Administration Bureau has increased significantly recently, with transactions of one or two mu of vacant land being the most numerous, followed by vacant houses worth around 100,000 yuan. Transactions of occupied real estate are scarce. For example, vacant land in better locations along Beijing Road, Guangdong Road, and Zhongshan East Road is currently priced at 140,000 to 160,000 yuan per mu, with few sellers and many buyers. However, in the same locations, the price of occupied real estate is as low as 40,000 yuan per mu, with many sellers eager to sell, but still few buyers. It is reported that larger real estate transactions currently underway include vacant land along Fuxu Road in Hartung Garden, but the asking prices are extraordinarily high. It is said that the asking price for vacant land along Fuxu Road is 160,000 yuan per mu, and the asking price for vacant land further inland is 90,000 to 100,000 yuan per mu. It is claimed that the actual value is about 120,000 yuan per mu for the former and about 70,000 yuan per mu for the latter.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Renyou, Director of the Water Police Bureau, and others were previously accused of aiding bandits, embezzlement, and dereliction of duty. After a preliminary investigation by the District Procuratorate, the accusations of aiding bandits against Zhang Renyou, Shan Guohua, and Wang Baoqian were transferred to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation according to the law. The investigation into the embezzlement and dereliction of duty charges has concluded. The defendants Zhang Renyou, Huang Boqian, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Water Police Bureau, Xia Zhimin, acting staff member of the branch bureau, Xie Yiyun, patrol officer of the Yangjing Police Station, Qin Shuming, foreman, Zhou Qing, boatman, Luo Zhaoqiang, patrol officer of the Xinzha branch of the Water Police Bureau, Tan Wenxi, shareholder of Bailai Motor Company, and Liang Jinhao, Deputy Manager of Bailai Motor Company, nine people in total, have been publicly prosecuted on charges of embezzlement and dereliction of duty according to the law.

This case was reported secretly to the President, who forwarded it through the Third Bureau of the Presidential Palace to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which then ordered the Shanghai Higher Court Procuratorate to instruct the District Procuratorate to investigate. The facts of Zhang et al.'s crimes and the evidence, as announced by the Procuratorate, are as follows:

(1) Regarding Zhang Renyou Concealing Evidence: Gu Anan and Song Rende had a prior grudge over a minor matter. On the morning of May 17th of this year, Gu Anan gathered dozens of hooligans, wielding knives to injure Song Rende. This was witnessed by Wang Youbin, a patrol officer of the Water Police Bureau. The victim identified Gu Anan and Tao Qiyun as the assailants, and Ding Xiangtao, owner of Hengcheng Fish Shop, and his wife Ding Zhu as the instigators. The Judicial Section of the Bureau arrested Tao Qiyun and Ding Zhu. However, Zhang Renyou arbitrarily released these two on bail, without further investigation or transfer to the court.

Concealing and Ignoring U.S. Dollar Transactions

(2) Regarding Zhang Renyou et al.'s Dereliction of Duty and Tan Wenxi et al.'s Violation of U.S. Dollar Transactions: Since 1936, Bailai Motor Company has been operating a car rental service for American military personnel at Pier 10 on the Bund. Liang Jinhao, the Deputy Manager of the company, was responsible for management, with 30 vehicles. There were approximately five or six rentals per day, with a rental fee of 45 cents in U.S. dollars each time. In July of this year, the company illegally constructed a wooden kiosk by the floating bridge at the aforementioned pier. The Water Police Bureau, upon discovering this, considered it a violation of police regulations due to the lack of an application for permission to build. They summoned Liang Jinhao and Tan Wenxi. Luo Zhaoqiang, a patrol officer of the bureau, was assigned to handle the case. He investigated the circumstances, with the intention of favoritism, completely disregarding the U.S. dollar transactions, and proposed only to demolish the illegally built wooden kiosk and suspend business operations. Shen Huan, the Chief of the First Section of the Bureau, believed that the punishment proposed by Luo Zhaoqiang was too lenient and independently requested Director Zhang Renyou to detain them for two days as a warning according to police regulations for illegally building a wooden kiosk, and to report the U.S. dollar car rental portion to the Economic Section for verification. Unexpectedly, Zhang Renyou intentionally colluded to cover up the matter, falsely claiming that the General Bureau had instructed via telephone to exempt the case from being sent and that there was no need for detention, directly handling it according to the method proposed by Luo Zhaoqiang, concealing the U.S. dollar transaction portion, and not transferring it to the Economic Section of the Police Headquarters for legal action.

Accepting Bribes to Release a Batch of Firearms

(3) Regarding Zhang Renyou and Xia Zhimin Accepting Bribes: Guo Yinzhang and Xu Youjun were patrol officers of the Huangpu North District branch of the Water Police Bureau. On May 9th of this year, they discovered a sailboat, Zhen Zi No. 856, anchored in Pudong, containing ten rifles, 1,003 rounds of ammunition, two wooden rifles, and 132 rounds of ammunition. Because there were no passports, the quantities were inconsistent, or the licenses were expired, they suspected smuggling. The items were immediately seized and sent to the Water Police Bureau. Xia Zhimin, the acting staff member of the Bureau, who is Director Zhang Renyou's nephew, accepted a bribe of 500,000 yuan through Qin Shuming, a foreman at the 16th Pier, on behalf of the boat owner Zhou Daiqing. He arbitrarily took charge of the case, not turning it over to the First Section of the Bureau, which is in charge of such matters. The next day, he drafted an opinion, without submitting it to the Deputy Director for review, and directly sent it to his uncle Zhang Renyou, who approved the release on bail.

(4) Regarding Zhang Renyou Extorting Property Under False Pretexts: The Xinfushen Steamboat had a damaged winch on March 16th of this year, causing wood to fall and kill a worker, Yang Qingjia. The Water Police Bureau investigated. Zhang Renyou, using the pretext that Guo Liangzhen, the general affairs director of the steamboat company, Wang Wengao, the chief engineer, and Gao Xiaolin, the winch worker, were suspected of negligent homicide, threatened to transfer them to the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate and extorted 200 million legal tender from Wu Delin, the general manager of the steamboat company, then used his position to alter the case to settle the matter.

Illegally Using Official Power to Embezzle Diesel Fuel

(5) Regarding Zhang Renyou and Huang Boqian Embezzling Public Property: The No. 8 motorboat of the Green Water Police Bureau uses diesel fuel. It was damaged by the Customs' Kesheng vessel in early March of this year and has not yet been repaired. Huang Boqian, using his authority as the chief of the General Affairs Section, submitted monthly expense reports to the General Bureau for diesel fuel consumption for patrol boats in March and April, embezzling a total of 331 gallons in March and 383 gallons in April. Fei Dingsen, the personnel administrator, discovered this and secretly reported it to Zhang Renyou, but Zhang Renyou ignored it, shielded him, and did not report it.

(6) Regarding Zhang Renyou and Xie Yiyun Soliciting Property: Cao Yusheng and others were caught stealing Texaco diesel fuel on May 6th of this year by the Water Police Bureau. Xie Yiyun, a staff member of the Bureau, was assigned to handle the case. Zhang Renyou colluded with Xie, claiming they could reduce Cao Yusheng's sentence, extorting 300 million legal tender from Cao Yusheng for their own use.

Huang Boqian's Theft and Sale of Public Property, Seeking Profit in Matters Outside His Jurisdiction, and Embezzlement in Official Matters

(7) Regarding Huang Boqian's Theft and Sale of Public Property, Seeking Profit in Matters Outside His Jurisdiction, and Embezzlement in Official Matters: In April of this year, Huang Boqian stole and sold a porcelain bathtub from the personnel administrator's office of the Water Police Bureau, obtaining 12 million yuan. In March of this year, he sold two large iron anchors stored in front of the Bureau's gate due to a case, obtaining 50 million yuan. In April of the same year, he sold seven large coils of submarine cable seized by the Yangjing Police Station due to a case, obtaining 8.7 million yuan in legal tender. On May 26th of the same year, he sold over 800 catties of stolen coal, obtaining 2.5 million yuan in legal tender. He repeatedly instructed Liu Ruowei and Chen Daikang, patrol officers of the Dongjiadu Police Station, to order local lumber yards to donate lumber, valued at approximately 200 million yuan in legal tender; ordered patrol officers of the Yangjing Police Station to solicit fresh fish from the people; and ordered Wen Zaoshi, a patrol officer of the inspection team, and police officer Fan Jianfu to solicit cigarettes to seek illegal profits.

In accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is hereby filed.

### Visiting the Princess at Sun Moon Lake: The Scenery of Taiwan's Indigenous People

‚Äî Xu Maochun

The anti-Japanese movement of Taiwan's Indigenous people wrote a glorious and tragic epic. Events such as the Qijiaochuan and Bawangjie incidents caused headaches for the Japanese. In particular, the Wushe incident of 1930, due to unbearable Japanese humiliation, resulted in the killing of 134 Japanese police and civilians. At the time, the Japanese used cannons and airplanes to carry out atrocities, but still failed to conquer Wushe. Finally, they used poison gas. Seeing that they could not resist, most of the people committed suicide in caves. The Japanese finally won, but this shocked the world, and countries that uphold humanitarianism and justice rose up to condemn them.

During the period of Japanese rule, the activities of the Indigenous people were extremely restricted, and they were called "raw savages," "civilized savages," or "local savages." The Indigenous people were severely discriminated against. This was a mistake. Since Taiwan's recovery, the Three Principles of the People have been used as the guiding policy‚Äîall ethnic groups within the country are equal. Therefore, the name "savage" has now been changed to "Indigenous people of the mountains" to correct people's perceptions.

I have been in Taiwan for three months. Wanting to understand the situation of the Indigenous compatriots, and driven by curiosity, I stole a moment of leisure from my busy schedule and went alone from Kaohsiung to Sun Moon Lake to visit these Indigenous compatriots who are of concern to the Chinese people.

Sun Moon Lake is located 29 kilometers east of Taichung City, north of Yushan, at an altitude of 726 meters. It forms a unique world. The lake is a sheet of emerald green, with endless ripples, like a large mirror, with the mountain shadows reflected in the heart of the lake, like a painting. Especially the morning mist and evening glow, the atmosphere is ever-changing, fleeting, and infinitely varied. It is truly worthy of being called the best scenery in Taiwan. This beautiful and fascinating scenery allows millions of travelers to immerse themselves and linger, forgetting to return‚Äîhow elegant and enviable is this homeland of the Indigenous compatriots!

The place where the Indigenous people live is called "Buji," on the eastern shore of Sun Moon Lake. After crossing the lake from Hanbi Building, I found a sign full of phonetic symbols under a coconut tree on the edge of the village of Buji, which read:

The Shao people of the mountains, 270 years ago, their ancestors discovered Sun Moon Lake while chasing white deer near Luanda Mountain and Batongguan. They then moved from Zhuma Village in Alishan to Shiren Village (located about three miles west of Buji on the edge of Sun Moon Lake). When the power project was completed, Shiren Village was submerged in water (Sun Moon Lake is the largest power reservoir in Taiwan), and they moved to Buji (local name Maolao Bao). Because of the convenient transportation, it was developed earlier. During the Japanese occupation, it was regarded as a "civilized savage," so it was called "Civilized Savage Village." In the past, the chief was the leader of a tribe. The village leader has been changed ten times. The current village chief, Mao Xinxiao, is the former chief of the tribe. The village currently belongs to Yuchi Township in Yushan District, Taichung County. The whole village has 41 households, with a population of 92 males and 87 females, totaling 179 people. There are 55 children in school. There are twelve surnames: Mao, Shi, Chen, Xie, Yuan, Huang, Gao, Liu, Zhang, Bi, Qiu, Zhu, etc. The community farms, fishes, and gathers firewood, which is self-sufficient. Every year from the first to the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, there is a grand dance party. Since the restoration of Taiwan, a Mandarin training class has been established in the village, divided into adult and children's classes, actively promoting Mandarin...

After reading this sign, I had a general understanding of the Indigenous people of Buji. I thought this was the time of their grand dance party, and I was feeling pleased with myself when I suddenly heard a melodious song. I discovered dozens of Indigenous people singing and dancing in a graceful manner. I hurried forward to watch. I saw them holding hands, using a large stone as the center, circling around in a large circle, singing and dancing, moving step by step to the right, with orderly rhythm. The singing echoed with the lake water, the lingering sound moving, and very enjoyable.

When this dance stopped, another song began. Several women each held a pestle and surrounded a hard stone with a diameter of about one meter, simultaneously raising the pestles, singing and pounding at the same time, with neat beats. It is said that this is the famous pestle song, also known as stone sound, using the sound of the pestle hitting the stone to coordinate the singing, which is also clear and melodious.

The Indigenous people have many songs. According to them, the song they sang the most times and the most easily that day, which I recorded and translated into Mandarin with Mr. Ye Yugang (from Shouning, Fujian), the Taiwanese Mandarin Promotion Committee official stationed in the village and the host of the Sun Moon Lake Mandarin Training Class, is a song called "‰∏çÊÄïÊµ™‰æÜ‰∏çÊÄïÈ¢®" (Not Afraid of Waves, Not Afraid of Wind), which is appended below to share with readers:

(Not Afraid of Waves, Not Afraid of Wind)

Not afraid of waves, not afraid of wind

We shake our fishing boats and head into the lake

Brother casts the net

Sister shakes the oar

For the sake of life, we don't care where the fishing boat goes

A family's fishing boat goes wherever

No moon, no stars

We light our fishing lights and head into the lake

Dad casts the net

Mom shakes the oar

For the sake of life, we don't care if there is no moon or stars

A family's fishing boat goes wherever

In the mist, the rain is drizzling

Shaking the fishing boat into the lake

Letting it drift with the waves

Not afraid of the tight wind and rain

Not afraid of the high waves

For the sake of life, we don't care about the fierce rain and wind

A family's fishing boat goes wherever

I visited Chief Mao Xinxiao, but the Chief was not at home. The eldest and second princesses received me. They were dressed very neatly, wearing Indigenous clothing of medium quality fabric, wearing colored glass bands on their heads, and inserting feathers. Their postures and facial features were very upright. Especially the second princess, who was eighteen years old, slender and graceful, was already moving enough. Added to that her very modern and beautiful cloud-like hair, and the evenly applied rouge and lipstick, her radiant appearance was even more charming. However, the only shortcoming was that although the upper half of her body was very exquisite, her feet were habitually bare, without shoes.

"Where did your father go?" I began to ask them in a very gentle tone.

"Dad went up the mountain," they both answered in fluent Mandarin, which surprised me so much that I stared wide-eyed.

"What are your names?"

"Mao Yujuan," the eldest princess said first. "Mao Axiu," the second princess followed.

"Who is in your family?"

"Dad, Mom, sister, and me," the second princess said quickly.

"No brothers?" I continued to ask.

"No," the second princess's tone was particularly charming.

"What are your husbands' names?" With the purpose of gathering material, I rudely asked them.

"Called Mao Ashou," the eldest princess said shyly. "My sister is not yet betrothed."

"Why does your husband also have the surname Mao?" I felt very strange.

"Matrilineal Marriage." The eldest princess hesitated for a moment, but the second princess was more quick-witted. "Outsiders call my sister Elizabeth, and call my sister's husband what, Edinburgh, or what, Mountbatten. They also call me what, Margaret!" She said intermittently, but I was even more surprised by her knowledge.

"What does the husband do? Is he not in the navy?" I said jokingly.

"He recently went to Shanghai to buy cloth," the eldest princess replied casually.

"Don't you feel lonely when he goes to Shanghai?" I asked the eldest princess with a smile. The eldest princess seemed not to have understood what I meant, and just sighed and stood up lazily. I discovered that her belly was already large. I thought to myself that her delivery period was probably around the same time as Elizabeth's.

"Who will you marry?" I asked the second princess half seriously and half jokingly.

"Marry your husband!" The eldest princess said loudly with a mischievous smile, pointing at me. "Chinese," the second princess also said naturally at the same time, causing a burst of laughter.

Finally, with their consent, I signed my name and took a photo as a souvenir. I took three photos with them in a row, and also asked them to teach me how to dance. I gave them 1,000 NT dollars in total (by convention, outsiders pay 200 NT dollars per person per photo with them, Sun Moon Lake has many tourists, according to statistics this income is considerable). I said goodbye to them amidst their continuous "Thank you!" "Goodbye!"

I inspected other parts of the village again. It was lunchtime, and the sound of drinking and guessing was everywhere. They used large bowls to hold wine, and two people drank from the same bowl in a very generous and pleasant manner. It is said that they are extremely fond of smoking and drinking, and almost every meal is inseparable from it, regardless of gender or age.

After walking a few dozen steps further, I discovered another miracle: a young man of about 22 or 23 years old was carrying a chair on his back, and a richly dressed young woman was sitting on the chair, followed by a large group of people, with gongs and drums, and continuous firecrackers. "What is this doing?" I asked myself in confusion, "This is a wedding!" A young man standing in front of me told me in very broken Mandarin, "The one sitting in the chair is the bride, and the one carrying the chair is the groom. They met while singing on the mountaintop and made a vow. On an auspicious day, the groom carries the chair to the bride's house to personally bring the bride back. However, this method is no longer used much. The new wedding method is to carry her in a sedan chair." I suddenly understood. Wouldn't men with slightly weaker physical strength be unqualified to marry with such a wedding method?

Taiwan has returned to the embrace of the motherland. The Indigenous people are a branch of our Chinese nation. They have made great progress, and they have kept up with the times. We must never discriminate against them as savages. We should cooperate sincerely, unite as one, let us hold hands of sincerity, and march in step toward the path of national rejuvenation! I have deep impressions from visiting the Indigenous people, and I hope that the Chinese people have this new understanding of the Indigenous people.

### The Iron Oxen Beside the Yellow River Bridge in Lanzhou Will Be Recast into Water Pipes

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Lanzhou, 29th] Lanzhou's tap water project is in dire need of water pipes, so it has been considered to use the scrap iron oxen beside the Yellow River Bridge to recast them into water pipes. After the Municipal Council approved this, excavation is imminent. It is said that there are two iron oxen on each of the north and south banks of the Yellow River. These were used to tow floating bridges before the iron bridge was built. Each ox weighs over 4,000 catties. During the War of Resistance, the police department had planned to auction these items to build the site of the 6th Branch Bureau, but they were unable to dig them out, so they have stood until now. Because the section buried in the soil is three-fifths longer than the exposed section, to excavate these heavy iron oxen, at least five cranes are needed.

### Six Sick Military Officers Gang-Rape Regimental Commander's Wife

Strange Drama at Wuhan Army Hospital

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Hankou, 22nd] A rape case recently occurred at the Wuhan Army Hospital. The wife of a certain regimental commander was in the hospital caring for her husband.

### A Sensational Love Tragedy in Taishan: Sisters in Love with the Same Man Willing to Share Him as Husband, Mother Disapproves, Both Commit Suicide by Poison

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Guangzhou, 22nd] A sensational love tragedy recently occurred near Foshan. A woman named Zeng Liu, whose husband runs a business in Hong Kong, has two daughters, the eldest named Jianping, 19 years old, and the younger named Huilan, 17 years old. Both are students in secondary school. The sisters successively fell in love with a male classmate named Huang Yixiong and were willing to share him as a husband. Unexpectedly, their mother discovered this and immediately ordered them to drop out of school and forbade them from interacting with Huang. The sisters then committed suicide by poison on the 20th, and jointly signed a suicide note to their mother and their lover, the words were sad and touching.

### Autumn Scenery Along the Long Right (Gansu) "Clouds Obscure the Mid-Autumn Moon, Granaries Burst Open" Farmers Yearn for a Bountiful Harvest

[Report from our Lanzhou correspondent on the 18th] Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival. Early in the morning, citizens scrambled to buy meat for the holiday. In the blink of an eye, the meat stalls were empty, naturally due to butchers engaged in "cold war" with the municipal government. In some places, there was even a rush to buy meat. An unconfirmed report stated that in one meat market scramble, a civil servant's index finger was mistaken for a pig's trotter by a butcher and severed in two. While this is likely an exaggeration, it is indicative of the situation in the market.

This year, festive gift packages have indeed disappeared from the market, and gift certificates have been ordered to be discontinued. "Frugality" seems to be widespread. Only the small mooncakes, following the price limits, have become noticeably thinner and conveniently smaller.

Many shops closed in the morning, and by afternoon, almost every store was shuttered, resembling the atmosphere of the abolished Lunar New Year. In the evening, floating clouds obscured the moon, much to the chagrin of men of letters and poets. However, the farmers squinted and smiled, recalling the saying, "Clouds obscure the Mid-Autumn Moon, granaries burst open," and looked forward to a bumper harvest next year.

Another year passes swiftly with the autumn wind! It is rumored that local authorities have also agreed on price limits for cotton, wool, fur, and other goods, awaiting publication. The "price manual," which has been the subject of much discussion for a week, has yet to be released. The Municipal Government's Economic Inspection Team recently conducted surprise inspections of warehouses and arrested "gold tigers," uncovering that several gold shops, including Deshunxing, were suspected of illegally trading gold and silver and engaging in private lending. Several trading firms, including Fujugong, were suspected of hoarding goods and dealing in hard currency. All were transferred to the Lanzhou Special Criminal Court for legal proceedings today. The seized goods are limited to being sold at the fixed prices within the city and are not allowed to be exported. At the same time, measures to strengthen the control of materials have also been announced. From now on, incoming goods must be registered, and no goods are allowed to be exported without approval. In this case, will the underground materials automatically emerge? People are hoping the government will conduct one or two general surveys.

Amid the nationwide price controls, the road maintenance fees of the Ministry of Transportation's 7th District Highway Engineering Bureau, as if having reached a tacit agreement, suddenly announced an increase during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The increase is a staggering one hundred and eighty percent, with the new rates for road maintenance fees in the provinces of Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Qinghai being four fen and five hao per ton-kilometer, and in Gansu Province, four fen and five li. It is said that the Bureau has been losing 200 billion yuan (legal tender) per month, and without the increase, it simply cannot sustain itself!

Zhang Zhizhong Inspects the Hexi Corridor

General Zhang Zhizhong has been in the Northwest for more than two years, but has mainly used Dihua (√úr√ºmqi) and Lanzhou as bases, flying back and forth. The strategic Hexi Corridor in the Northwest has not been visited even once. Therefore, on the 5th of this month, he set off with more than 30 people to inspect the Hexi Corridor, and is expected to return around the 25th or 26th. In addition to inspecting military and political facilities in the Hexi Corridor, another task for Zhang is to facilitate a major reconciliation between party and group figures.

After strengthening economic controls, six of the original nine credit cooperatives in Lanzhou were forcibly shut down, and three were allowed to resume operations. More than two months have passed, but none have resumed operations. The reason is that the government restricts the business scope of each credit cooperative to its members only. Each cooperative considers that it will be impossible to maintain operations after resumption, and with the market depressed and financial stagnation after the currency reform, each cooperative is wary. It seems that if the government does not amend the restrictive regulations, even these three credit cooperatives that were approved to resume operations but have not yet done so will be dissolved.

After the currency reform, the national banks stopped all lending. Public and private enterprises in the city felt that the turnover of funds was sluggish. Public enterprises, because the prices of their products were frozen, while the salaries and allowances of their employees suddenly doubled, have begun to adopt austerity policies. The result, of course, is layoffs. All eyes are on the opening of loans, but according to Yang Jiqing, manager of the Central Bank, the board of directors of the Joint Four Banks is still studying the matter.

### Selling Prices Mostly Reach the Limit; Rice Is Consistently Strong; Fufeng and Other Seven Factories Began Distributing Flour Yesterday

Rice market price limits have stabilized. Due to the continued scarcity of arrivals, few samples are available on the market. Although sales are sluggish, due to even scarcer supply, the market remains firm and transactions are quite slow. The market closed very early. In the southern market, all japonica rice has reached the limit price, except for high-milled indica rice. In the northern market, all rice is also open at the limit price. Transactions in the market are mostly for medium-quality goods, with few high-quality goods available and little trading. Yesterday's arrivals totaled 2,023 shi in the north and south markets combined.

Flour supply is scarce, transactions are slow, and the market continues to be firm. Lao Che, Bingship, Hong Lan, Jiancheng, etc., are not opening due to no supply. Only Jinlong Flour and Maigen Flour, which have lower quality, are opening at the limit price. Hero Flour is less desirable, opening at 6.885 yuan. Furthermore, Fufeng, Fuxin, and other seven major manufacturers jointly allocated flour of various brands to retailers. It is estimated that over 300 registered retailers were allocated over 7,000 packages, each receiving approximately 25 packages. Bran is opening at the limit price.

Coarse Grains are firm, with not many transactions. The appetite for yellow soybeans in foreign-style shops has decreased. Oil factories are purchasing them. Car beans and Zha beans are each at the limit price. New yellow soybeans are selling well on this street, and the market is quite profitable. More corn is being purchased by the northern gangs, and the price has increased by 10-20 jiao. Red sorghum is active in the countryside and has also increased by 10-20 jiao. Broad beans, naked barley, and mung beans are all average. Sesame is still at the previous day's price, and blanched peanuts have some transactions at a slightly higher price.

Edible Oil continues to rise, as people's hearts remain firm due to the rise in all grains. Soybean oil has significant fluctuations. It initially opened at 50.05 yuan, once reaching 51.5 yuan, and closed at 50.03 yuan due to continuous outgoing orders, an increase of 8 jiao. Rapeseed oil closed at 47 yuan, an increase of 5 jiao. Pure rapeseed oil is at 59.9 yuan, one jiao away from the limit price. Hot rapeseed oil increased by 5 jiao, and small-cart sesame oil was specially lowered by 1 jiao. Soybean cake is still trading at 4.1 yuan.

### Legal Tender Public Bonds Must Be Redeemed Within the Deadline; Failure to Collect Will Result in Forfeiture

According to Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, who came to Shanghai to see off Minister of Finance Wang on behalf of the Ministry of Finance: (1) The government has promulgated the method of advancing the settlement of legal tender public bonds by tiered doubling, and this department shall comply with it. The principal and interest of the actually sold amounts of various public bonds that should be settled in advance are estimated to be 6 billion yuan in legal tender. The gold yuan base required for settlement has been allocated to the managed banks by the National Bank of China. The unexpired bond number books and instructions on the settlement procedure have also been compiled and are being sent to the managed banks by the Ministry of Finance via the National Bank of China for selection. This settlement period will begin on October 1st in all parts of the country and will last for six months. Bond tickets that are not applied for settlement after the deadline will be invalidated. (2) The principal and interest of the U.S. dollar public bonds of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), which will mature at the end of this month, will still be handled in accordance with the original regulations. The U.S. dollar funds required have been communicated by the Ministry of Finance to the National Bank of China, which has allocated them in full to the Fund Management Committee for payment. (3) The government has promulgated the method of exchanging foreign currency bonds for reorganized public bonds. The Gold Lan ÂÖ¨ÂÇµ Statute proposal has been drafted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. Registration and exchange procedures will be carried out once the regulations are promulgated.

[Another Report] Director Chen Bingzhang returned to Nanjing by train last night.

### Money Supply Is Increasingly Loose; Banks Are Significantly in Deficit

Yesterday, the looseness of the money supply in the city became even more apparent. The Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury were significantly in deficit in the exchange of bills and notes among the silver and money industries, totaling 2.77 million yuan. Among them, the Central Bank was in deficit by 1.41 million, the Bank of China was in deficit by 1.34 million, the Bank of Communications was in surplus by 320,000, the Farmers Bank was in deficit by 490,000, the China Trust Bureau was in surplus by 180,000, the Postal Savings Bureau was in deficit by 30,000, and the Central Cooperative Treasury was balanced. Commercial banks were in surplus by 430,000 in large transactions and 190,000 in small transactions. Foreign banks were in surplus by 430,000 in total.

### Statistics on the Purchase of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency

The total amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency purchased by the National Bank of China and its entrusted agency banks on the 21st is as follows:

Gold: 29834.163 taels, silver: 28238.98 taels, silver dollars: 125781.50 coins, silver dimes: 115356 jiao (double hao), U.S. dollars: 57301.80 yuan, Hong Kong dollars: 233041.1 yuan, totaling 8789126.56 yuan in gold yuan.

The Central Bank has temporarily suspended the purchase of pounds sterling and rupees because the British government has banned their import. In order to protect the rights and interests of the people, the Central Bank is negotiating with the British government. Holders can entrust them to the Central Bank for safekeeping before the end of this month. In addition, the Philippine peso, which was previously suspended for exchange, has now been resumed by the Central Bank.

### Limited Transactions of Foreign-Style Tea

In the foreign-style tea market, which has been stagnant for many days, exporters were still enthusiastically inquiring yesterday. However, due to the scarcity and high prices in the production areas, the owners continued to be reluctant to part with their goods easily, resulting in a calm process and only sporadic transactions. The trend can be considered stable.

It is understood that North Africa is very concerned about Fu tea and is still sending telegrams to tea merchants here to inquire about prices. However, the production cost of our country's tea has gradually increased, which will be higher than the price of tea abroad. In this situation, it will be increasingly difficult to cooperate with exports, and the future may not be optimistic. As for domestic sales tea, supply and demand are still there, and there is no significant change.

### Sugar Is in a Slump

Since the ban on the export of sugar, foreign sales have been suspended. The amount cleared on this street is also limited, so the market is in a slump. Yesterday's transactions were rare, and the trend was particularly flat. The price of 20th-term Taiwan Red Warehouse receipts opened at 24.57 yuan in the morning and closed at 24.70 yuan in the afternoon. (No spot goods were seen on the market.) Bagged and leather-packed half-sugar closed at 29 yuan and 28.9 jiao respectively, a decrease of 10-20 jiao compared with the previous day. Coarse sand was slightly more beautiful by one jiao, at 27.2 yuan. Native fine white sugar rose by 2 jiao, while other grades remained at the previous day's price.

### Total Amount of Export Exchange Settlement Last Week Nearly US$5 Million

[Report from our correspondent] The amount of export goods from Shanghai that applied for exchange settlement this week (September 12 to September 18) increased compared with last week. The total figure is equivalent to US$4,986,097.62. This includes US$1,899,483.38 for export goods for which the government settles the exchange itself (i.e., gauze, ore, sugar, etc.). Divided by commodity type: (Unit: US dollars) Hog bristles: $668,498.19, Tung oil: $556,126.37, Furs: $87,247.60, Blue oil: $176,437.54, Tea: $43,798.99, Straw hats: $123,857.56, Embroidered clothing: $31,805.26, Feathers: $69,455.52, Metals and their products: $71,952.52, Wool yarn and raw silk: $11,442.49, Eggs: $129,015.99, Cotton fabrics: $218,233.61, Wool and wool fabrics: $73,497.56, Silk fabrics: $168,300.82, Vegetables and their products: $21,089.70, Sundries: $635,854.52, Cloth: $731,795.07, Cotton yarn: $1,141,786.36, Ore: $18,739.10, Sugar: $7,162.85.

### Silk Prices Are Stable, Transactions Are Rare

Raw silk prices are stable, and transactions are rare. Both wholesale and retail traders are holding a wait-and-see attitude, and the market is in a state of depression. Artificial silk from Italian sources is plentiful, and all parties are saturated. The 82nd term of the Silk Weaving Guild's allocation of goods from the China Trust Bureau has been received, and distribution to various silk factories began yesterday. The 83rd term has been submitted for approval. There are few Japanese goods on the market, and there are no transactions.

Furthermore, the domestic autumn sales have begun, and retail sales in stores are even more prosperous. Wholesale firms have sold a little, but not much. Shanghai accounts for half of the 500,000 rolls allocated by the Silk Weaving Guild. Once consultations with the Silk Fabric Association are completed, distribution will be carried out extensively. However, the demand for spot goods in the market is still high, but inventories are thin, and there are even fewer transactions.

### Artificial Silk Allocation Price Determined

The price of artificial silk for this week's allocation has been decided by the China Trust Bureau as follows: (1) 120 Bright: 1,033.3 yuan per case, (2) 120 Dull: 1,126.3 yuan, (3) 120 Bright: 878.3 yuan, (4) 75 Bright: 1,188.3 yuan, (5) 75 Dull: 1,271 yuan, (6) 100 Bright: 1,074.6 yuan, (7) 150 Bright: 921.3 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Market Is Mediocre; Cloth Sources Are Not Scarce, Trend Is Declining

The cotton yarn market was firm first and then soft yesterday. People's sentiments were calm, and the market atmosphere was also soft. Yesterday, customers on this street were not very interested, and fine yarn was slightly soft. For 20-count coarse yarn, supply and demand were equal, and the price did not change. For 16-count and below, Shenxin opened for distribution with many varieties, people's hearts turned tired, and prices were weak.

The cloth market trend was declining yesterday. Amidst the increase in capital of the firms, the owners slightly sold off their goods, and the market trend was initially very firm. Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi yuan pique both opened at 28.5 yuan. After the addition of the allocation of cotton cloth by the dyeing guild to retail cloth shops, customers were satiated. Customers held a wait-and-see attitude because the large-scale export ban was still suspended. Mid-way, the supply was not scarce, and high prices were difficult to support. Transactions were sparse at closing, and most reported declines.

Longtou fine cloth closed at 27.8 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 5 jiao compared with the previous day. Wufu fine cloth traded at 25.5 yuan, a decrease of 4 jiao. Longtou B fine cloth slightly decreased by 1 jiao, Laba brand children's fine cloth was flat, and pique was in demand and the price was slightly rising. Sijunzi yuan pique rose to 28.4 yuan, approaching theÊ∂® limit. Sijunzi yuan was bought directly at 29.7 yuan. The total transaction volume for the city was 1,260 bolts. In the afternoon, cotton cloth delivered by the Machinery Dyeing Guild was allocated as usual. The third batch included 830 bolts of flannel, 563 bolts of bed sheet cloth, 1,270 bolts of women's fancy woolen fabric, and 928 bolts of poplin.

[Report from our correspondent] According to the reports from the member factories of the Shanghai Cotton Textile Association in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai areas, the total amount of yarn and cloth sold by the factories themselves was 486 bales of cotton yarn (equivalent to 20-count yarn) and 12,985 bolts of cotton cloth.

### The Export Control Commission Is Trying to Coordinate Packaging Materials for Cement Plants

[Report from our correspondent] According to the Export Control Commission, since the victory, our country's cement production has increased significantly. Many orders have come from abroad, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea. However, the lack of materials needed to package the cement has affected the export quantity. To comply with Premier Weng's policy of promoting the export of cement and other products and maintaining the production of our country's cement industry, and to help cement plants obtain paper bags for packaging cement, the Export Control Commission has held several consultations with relevant parties and decided on the following measures, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval:

(1) Huaxin, Qixin, China, Shanghai, Jiangnan, North China, and Shunchang cement plants requested to purchase approximately 1.5 million paper bags from abroad for US$165,000 to meet urgent needs. The Export Control Commission submitted to the Executive Yuan for temporary transfer of the US$165,000 quota allocated to the above-mentioned factories in the fourth quarter forÈ∫ªË¢ãÈ∫ª sack. This will pay for the paper bags for the above-mentioned purpose. The foreign exchange for the import will be settled in accordance with the current trade regulations.

(2) Each factory must strive to export cement. As soon as a sales contract is signed with a foreign merchant, a letter of credit can be issued by the bank to import paper bags. The import of each batch of paper bags must be compared with the value of the exported cement. The maximum total value of imported paper bags shall not exceed US$1 million.

(3) After each cement factory has exported US$1 million worth of cement, it can apply to import paper bags and the equipment it needs in accordance with the packaging material import method.

Mr. Loebiass, the current chairman and founder of China Canada Co., Ltd., and Mr. Umesday, the American representative of the company, provided much assistance in the discussion of the above-mentioned measures. They are willing to advance funds for the import of these paper bags before each factory has exported cement, in order to express their belief in and sincerity in assisting China.

### Commercial Briefs

Woolen fabrics are tight due to the autumn sales season, and retail and cutting businesses are extremely prosperous. Several high-end imported goods are holding a wait-and-see attitude. Many domestic goods from domestic users have been released, and manufacturers have also opened for sale. Dashi face flannels, etc., must be slightly marked up above the limit price to be purchased.

The people's goods in the paper circle are allocated to various wax merchants according to the limit price. The amount allocated is still determined by the amount of regular dealings. American goods in the paper circle are difficult to buy even at the limit price due to the depletion of market inventory. The monthly quota for Minfeng paper is 800 boxes, which is allocated according to the output of each factory.

The Silk Weaving Industry Association plans to allocate 500,000 yards of silk fabrics. Samples from each factory have been collected. The Silk Industry Association has been informed to prepare for the allocation to begin within the next week.

High-end goods of radios and important parts have disappeared from the market in the city. The products of the four major companies are being snapped up. Many holders of goods are hiding them and not selling them. Inferior goods are being sold on the market.

### Guo Youyi Will Recommend Allowing Japan to Join UNESCO

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Dr. Guo Youyi stated after a ten-day inspection here that he will recommend allowing Japan to join certain departments of UNESCO. Before leaving here for Paris via the United States, Guo stated that UNESCO already has a good informal start in Japan, and Japan is genuinely enthusiastic about the ideals of UNESCO.

### Looking at National Culture from Sculptural Art

‚Äî Liu Huarui

Since the promotion and development of archeology in China, artifacts from the Yangshao period (Late Neolithic Period of Yang Shao) have provided us with clues to trace ancient culture. The pottery and oracle bones unearthed from the Yin Ruins in Henan have been particularly helpful in proving whether Chinese civilization has close ties with Central Asia. (e.g., theories such as Faraguher's "Western Origin of Chinese Culture" and Ball's "Sumerian Culture" and "Chinese Culture"). The gradual excavation of bronzes has further demonstrated the development of Chu culture (the eighth century era in the Hubei and Hunan regions). Even the records of Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, and Dayu may prove to be more than just myths. The plants, trees, birds, and animals in the *Erya* and *Classic of Mountains and Seas* have also provided many materials for the history of botany and zoology (see My. Sowerby's works for the Asian Cultural Association).

The Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office recently held a Chinese sculpture exhibition, displaying many exhibits related to ancient literature, which are worthy of research and reference. All the pottery, bronzes, stone carvings, and wood carvings are particularly helpful in allowing us to understand that ancient Chinese civilization was not corrupt, backward, but magnificent and great. Even the single category of sculpture can rival Greek culture. It is modern Chinese art that is empty and withered, without having established itself.

The daily clothes and ornaments, such as the "coronet," "hat," and "tassel" recorded in the *Book of Rites* and the *Zhou Rituals*, as well as musical instruments and architecture, are very beautiful and independent, and can be further understood in the exhibits. For example, the color of the Tang Sancai "Plate" from Ding Huikang's collection is bright and strong, reflecting the prosperity of the Tang Dynasty. The rubbings of the stone carvings "Flying Immortal" and "Flying Tiger" unearthed in the Shapingba area of Chongqing from Chen Yishi's collection can be used to examine that Song Dynasty art was indeed not inferior to modern European and American patterns. In particular, the ancient bronze *yi* vessels such as the Chu "Mirror" and Zhou "Dun" (from the collections of Jiang Xuanyi and Ye Shuchong) are very helpful for reference to primitive history. Indeed, the *dunhou* (honest and generous) civilization produced by the *dunhou* Chinese nation is a symbol whose value shines brightly for thousands of years, with little sign of decline. What a miracle! In addition, the Wei pottery from Ruizhai's collection and Zheng Zhenduo's collection, and the stone carvings and wood carvings from Liu Haisu's collection, can all inspire us to reflect on Chinese culture.

If our academic circles can conduct comparative research based on the treasures unearthed in various eras and develop new artistic materials for our nation, then we can change the habit of fantasizing and splitting hairs in books over the past 20 years, and of mystifying or doubting the past, portraying Chinese national culture as mysterious or worthless. All this is enough to destroy the academic value of national culture without leaving anything behind, and there will be no way to establish a new national consciousness for the future. This is what the academic circles of our country should deeply consider and reflect on in the future.

### Yang Weibin and Zhu Zhiying Win Women's Doubles Championship, Defeating Pan Lvfu and Mrs. Ford in Two Sets. Men's Doubles Final Unfinished Due to Rain.

The men's doubles final followed. Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng played against Ye Guanxiong and Cai Guoji. Tao and Wang took the first set 7-5. When Tao and Wang were leading 4-2 in the second set, a heavy rain suddenly arrived, making it impossible to continue the match, which was declared suspended. The organizers have decided to reschedule the match to Saturday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. at the same venue. The results of the matches yesterday are recorded below:

Women's Doubles Final

Men's Doubles Final

Tao Guanqiu Wang Wenzheng {7-5, 4-2} Ye Guanxiong Cai Guoji

Women's Doubles Difficult to Separate

Pan and Ford took the stage and won two consecutive games, taking the lead. Yang and Zhu fought hard and tied the score at 2-2. The seesaw battle continued, with points going back and forth until the score was tied at 6-6. Yang and Zhu gradually gained the upper hand, winning two consecutive games to take the first set 8-6. In the second set, the two foreign ladies began to falter. Mrs. Ford was exhausted and unable to run. Yang and Zhu then attacked this weakness, winning 6-3 in a row. Yang Weibin and Zhu Zhiying won the Shanghai Women's Doubles Championship in straight sets.

Men's Doubles Rescheduled to Saturday

Following this, the men's doubles match took place. Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng played against Ye Guanxiong and Cai Guoji, with Lin Shihua as the referee.

### World Middleweight Boxing Championship: France's Cerdan Crowned Champion After Knocking Out America's Zale in New York

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 22nd] World middleweight champion America's Zale fought against European middleweight champion Cerdan last night in the Roosevelt gymnasium here to determine the victor. In the twelfth round, Zale could not hold on, and the referee ordered the fight to stop, declaring Cerdan the winner. Thus, the title of world middleweight champion was won by Cerdan.

[Agence France-Presse, Translation from West City, 2nd] French middleweight boxer Cerdan defeated world champion Italy's Zale in front of 19,272 spectators here today to win the middleweight championship. Zale was finally defeated in the twelfth round. In the twelve rounds of the match, Zale only won once in the fourth round, the third round was a draw, and Cerdan won all the other ten rounds. From the beginning of the match, Cerdan was already in the lead, and Zale was obviously no match for him. Cerdan is the seventh Frenchman to win the world boxing championship. The first seven were: (1) Carpentier won the featherweight championship in 1920, (2) Cisse won the light heavyweight championship in 1930, (3) Criqui won the featherweight championship in 1923, (4) Routis won the featherweight championship in 1928, (5) Puran won the featherweight championship in 1929, (6) Lannel won the middleweight championship in 1932. Cerdan, who won the championship this time, was born in 1916 in Sidi Bel Abb√®s, Algeria, North Africa. He started as a professional boxer in Morocco in 1934.

Three sessions of table tennis league matches, three additional matches will be held today (23rd). Two matches in Group A will be held in the Jingwu Association‚Äôs gymnasium, with Jingwu Blue alternately fighting against Jingwu Red and the strong Huamei team. Jingwu Blue is the second team of Jingwu forces, and it has been showing great sharpness in this session, defeating strong teams such as Lianxing and Huanan, with the prospect of directly attacking the core area. However, in last week's match against Lianxing A, the chopper player Shui Hangao made a mistake, which led to the team's first defeat. The morale of the entire team was frustrated. Today, it will quickly fight against the double heroes who seem to be dragons and tigers, completing the final two courses. Unless an upset occurs, Jingwu Blue will be difficult to win. At that time, the team members will have to rely on strength and spirit to obtain excellent performance.

### A Rickshaw Ride

‚Äî Mengqiu

The day before yesterday evening, I went to a Japanese restaurant in Hongkou for a Japanese hot pot at a friend's invitation. After eating and sweating all over, my friend was still in high spirits and insisted on treating me to a movie at the Guanglu Theater. The Guanglu Theater is at the end of the Museum Road, which is now called Huqiu Road, as everyone must know.

After the movie ended, it was almost eleven o'clock, and it was drizzling. I happily thanked my friend and wanted to hail a rickshaw home.

The rickshaw driver asked, "Where to?"

"The intersection of Baker Road and McBain Road," I said.

Baker Road and McBain Road, even I found it tongue-twisting, like saying a tongue twister. Why are these two awkward transliterations so similar and so close together? There are new road names. McBain Road is called "Xinchang Road," but if you say Xinchang Road when hailing a rickshaw, at least seven or eight out of ten rickshaw drivers won't know it. Over time, I even forgot what the new name for Baker Road is.

The rickshaw driver smiled, revealing a gold tooth. He said, "Seven jiao of silver coins."

Seven jiao? Isn't that 2.1 million in legal tender? How could he say it! I was furious and ignored him. I hailed again:

"Rickshaw!"

"Where to?" Another one came.

"Baker Road and McBain Road."

"Five jiao. It's raining, sir."

"Five hundred thousand!"

"Sir, five hundred thousand is only enough for a few pancakes! Okay, four jiao!"

"Five hundred thousand!"

"Okay, I'll give you three jiao, can't go any lower."

I ignored him and walked south. He followed behind. I saw empty rickshaws at the intersection of Beijing Road. Just as I was about to hail one, he spoke again:

"Sir, two and a half jiao is fine, right? Things are expensive!"

"Okay, six hundred thousand, not a single extra copper coin."

He sighed and said:

"Come, come, come, seven hundred thousand, seven hundred thousand. You, sir, don't care about a hundred thousand."

I looked and saw that the raindrops were getting bigger. The empty rickshaws at the intersection of Beijing Road had already found customers. If I insisted, I might not be able to hail one even if I ran to the Bund and Sichuan Road in the rain. I had no choice but to say "Damn!" in my heart and crouch down to get on the rickshaw. As soon as I sat down, I felt that the upper part of my silk gown was already thoroughly wet. As the rickshaw slowly moved forward, I couldn't help but curse "Damn" again under my breath.

The inside of the rickshaw was naturally stuffy and hot, but the rain was getting heavier and heavier, hitting the rickshaw canopy with a sound like someone scattering a plate of beans on the floor.

After a long time, I saw the International Hotel. Suddenly, he turned a corner. I thought, he's probably taking a shortcut, right? The Park Road next to the International Hotel does seem a bit shorter than McBain Road.

However, he suddenly stopped. The rickshaw driver got out of the rickshaw and began to untie the oilcloth on the rickshaw.

I felt that something was wrong and said, "I'm going to the intersection of Baker Road and McBain Road, we haven't arrived yet!"

Suddenly, his face turned ugly, and he said fiercely, "We agreed to go to the intersection of Park Road and Baker Road, we're here!"

Heavy rain was pouring down.

I had no choice but to give in: "Okay, okay, I'll give you an extra hundred thousand, to a little bit west of the intersection of Baker Road and McBain Road, not quite to the Sino-American Hospital."

He didn't answer, got back on the rickshaw seat, and pedaled slowly.

I took out my wallet from my bag and, in the light of the street lamps shining through the oilcloth, I counted the banknotes one by one. Damn it, except for a few hundred thousand in gold standard notes, they were all brand new gold yuan notes. I had to ask him for change‚ÄîI would have to stand in the heavy rain for a few more minutes. The yellow leather shoes on my feet were just bought the day before yesterday!

We arrived. I got off the rickshaw and gave him a gold yuan note worth one yuan.

He said, "One yuan, I still need to give you change‚Äî" Then he muttered softly, "What a hassle!" While counting the banknotes from the clip on his belt.

The rain was still falling, and a few cold raindrops landed on my fur hat, making me feel inexplicably uncomfortable.

He took out a dozen banknotes. I counted them, and there were only two million. I said, "There are only two million, that's two hundred thousand short, right?"

He got angry and said, "I don't have any smaller bills!"

I really couldn't take it anymore and thought about knocking on the door of the cigarette and paper store next door to exchange for smaller bills before giving it to him. Two hundred thousand was nothing, but it was really irritating...

But the rain was getting heavier and heavier, and there was thunder.

Besides, I was already at the door. I was soaking wet, and the silk gown was sticking to my body like "tofu skin" pulled out of soup.

Without saying a word, I turned around and took out the key to open the door.

Seeing that I wasn't talking, he laughed as he pedaled the rickshaw away: "Haha, what use can two hundred thousand possibly have! Okay, okay, big shot!"

I was furious. When I looked back, he was already far away.

### Imperial Market

‚Äî Zhang Qing

Perhaps the most bizarre exchange in the entire world is the "Imperial Market" in Zurich, Switzerland.

For example, if you are certain that Spain will restore its monarchy, you can buy shares of the Spanish crown prince, Don Juan, just as you would buy ordinary stock. Conversely, if you are convinced that the Swedish royal family will abdicate and declare a republic, you can "sell off" shares of the Swedish king.

The price of these stocks naturally fluctuates wildly. For instance, when Don Juan suddenly moved his restoration-preparation headquarters to the Spanish border some time ago, his stock immediately soared. Similarly, when King Michael of Romania, valuing love over his kingdom, abdicated and fled overseas, his stock plummeted.

The participants in this stock market are naturally quite diverse, and their buying and selling have very selfish motives. Their main goal is to secure certain privileges after a restoration. As for the nobles who enthusiastically run around raising funds for restoration, they hope to return to the prosperous and honorable days of yore.

Currently, the most "in the know" stock in this market is Don Juan. He owns a villa in Estoril, a small town on the Portuguese coast, where he receives a constant stream of distinguished guests and maintains very close ties with Madrid, the capital of Spain. His followers are in high spirits because it is a well-known fact that the United States supports Don Juan. It is said that the State Department very much hopes he can replace Franco. According to reports in "The Nation" magazine, the State Department even requested the Pope's understanding in this matter.

Moreover, Don Juan is currently the head of the historically famous Bourbon family. The Bourbon family has produced a remarkable number of emperors and kings. Since Odo ascended the French throne in 888 AD, this family has produced thirty-seven French emperors, seventeen Spanish kings, twenty-nine Portuguese kings, twenty-one Neapolitan kings, thirteen Hungarian kings, and four Holy Roman Emperors. None of these countries have a monarchy today, but Don Juan's associates are deeply convinced that the time for restoration is not far off.

Another "hot" stock in the Imperial Market is Umberto, the deposed King of Italy. After the Italian people held a referendum and voted in favor of a republic, he was forced to leave the country, but he never formally abdicated. Moreover, he is well aware that in the current unstable political situation in Italy, there are many royalists who hope for his return.

In addition, the deposed King Michael of Romania and his father, Carol (both of whom abdicated because they valued love over their kingdom), are also attracting attention, while the deposed King Leopold of Belgium is not being consulted by many. Zog, the deposed King of Albania, also often likes to talk about the activities of royalist underground movements in his country, but the customers of the Imperial Market show no interest in him at all.

Most strangely, there is even a "Count of Paris" who claims to want to return to France to become emperor. Like Don Juan, he also lives in Estoril. Before his imperial dream is realized, this gentleman is quite well-behaved, engaging in scientific farming and earning a decent income. He works diligently every day in overalls and is not very keen on discussing politics. Whenever he has free time, he plays with his children‚Äîhe has as many as ten.

The French government does not allow him to return to the country, but in 1938 he actually snuck back once and held a press conference in the suburbs of Paris, declaring passionately: "The time is ripe for the restoration of the French Empire!" Unfortunately, his call was ignored, and he had to quietly return to Portugal to farm.

However, some people in the Imperial Market are paying attention to him, and occasionally someone wants to buy his stock.

### Miscellaneous Poems from the Art Pavilion

‚Äî Shi Shufan

Written on the Night of August 14th

Leaning on the railing, gazing up and down, how deep the night, the grass and trees turn yellow, the Milky Way shifts, the heavy dew on the green sky like tears of jade, the bright moon makes the white stork also drift, a year of empty dreams of home, half a lifetime of pity for exhaustion, the old guest of Shanxi gazes bitterly east, only now the city walls are lost in red flags.

My bones dissolve, my heart rots as I sit and sigh, faintly thousands of spirits whisper, Mother in the underworld also gazes at the moon, stray children cannot return home after the chaos; the insects keep me company at the third watch, a million miles without clouds make my eyes spin, white hair, a coffin of paulownia wood in the fires of war, how can one bear to offer a cake to the ends of the earth!

Using autumn to describe my life, I regret the passing of half of it, the tall wutong trees exhale sorrow, rustling as if wielding a brush, harmonizing with the sounds of ten thousand insects below, only saying wine is worth enjoying. Marquis Yao comes from Moling, with weakened muscles but strong arms, sitting in the pavilion, the scene is strange, tea smoke condenses and disperses, when will there be clarity outside the cup, at the end of the year I stroke my belly and sigh! Rivers and lakes are inherently diverse, who will change the way things are done? Subtle words are overly prized, the ink colors are empty and dazzling, struggling bitterly with creation, more clumsy than forging gold. The killing air of the golden sky is stern, the old man's intention turns indifferent, lightly punishing the crime of poetry, banished to West Lake, the embankment is named after Bai Su, the willows on the bridge still bear the surname Duan, the cuckoo's cry is fortunately not in season, if it ends, the world will be in chaos, raising my sleeves to overturn the chessboard, blurred and ancient, the states of Chu and Han.

My illness relapses during Mid-Autumn Festival, I could not go to Hangzhou, so I write a letter of apology to the gentlemen on the lake the next morning.

White-robed boats drift on waves of wine at night, surely saying the elegance is better than in years past, the lake surface is clear and wide, heaven is stingy, autumn silkworms enter their third sleep. (I have been sick three times from summer to autumn.)

Floating clouds are unsettled, the moon is startled, especially rolling away the clouds until the fourth watch, I am on the rooftop with my white hair, the human world bitterly hopes for the Yellow River to be clear!

### Formula

‚Äî Lin

One day, a person went to visit the great scientist Albert Einstein. He rambled on for a long time, insisting that Einstein tell him the secret to success. Einstein said politely: "Suppose we use A to represent a person's success, then the formula for success should be: A equals X plus Y plus Z. X is work, and Y is play."

The guest asked, "What is Z?"

Einstein smiled slightly and said, "Z is to talk less."

### Eastern Scales, Western Claws

The best-selling book in the world is undoubtedly the Bible, with an average of thirty million copies sold each year, eighty thousand copies sold each day, and an average of fifty-five copies sold per second.

The Native Americans of the Americas are often hired as machine installation workers because they have a special innate skill: they can walk on a round shaft without feeling dizzy at all.

Australian earthworms are ten to twelve feet long and three-quarters of an inch thick, making them the largest earthworms in the world.

### I Fear Shanghai

‚Äî Jiao Xin

I fear coming to Shanghai the most, but for the sake of making a living, I continue to come to Shanghai.

My hometown is an old city with few of the conveniences of the twentieth century, so it is despised by the people of Shanghai; but I am deeply attached to its "simplicity."

In my hometown, wearing a cloth uniform and outdated leather shoes will not subject me to the scorn of others; but in Shanghai, the situation is different: when boarding the tram, the ticket seller will wave his hand and tell you to go to the third class; when buying things, the shop assistant will never give you the best goods; they are well-versed in the ways of the world and know that your wallet is empty just by looking at your shabby clothes.

When visiting relatives and friends, if they are not at home and you need to wait at their house, the male and female servants are always unwilling to let you into the parlor. That kind of facial expression is truly unbearable to see; even if you enter the parlor, the servants will constantly peek at you through the crack in the door, as if a criminal were being watched by detectives; they do not treat you as a guest at all, but simply regard you as a thief. In Shanghai, you cannot wear cloth clothes; if you wear cloth clothes, you are suspected of stealing things!

As for cigarettes, I always smoke the lower-grade ones, which is fine in my hometown, but in Shanghai, I will run into trouble. Twice, friends came to see me, and I still offered them the lower-grade cigarettes. The friend quickly took out a cigarette from his pocket and said, "The same, don't be polite!" As he spoke, he offered me one. I saw that it was an expensive imported brand, so how could it be "the same"? His "the same" was just a polite "euphemism," and in reality, he disdained to smoke the lower-grade cigarette that was despised by the so-called upper class.

A movement to build the country with frugality is now underway, and newspapers publish large-scale news reports every day, with great fanfare. I thought that the previous extravagant atmosphere had changed. This time I came to Shanghai again, changing my fearful mood for a joyful one. But Shanghai is still Shanghai, and my joyful mood has changed back to a fearful one!

### Saint sighed is not a Talented Scholar

‚Äî Wu Yong

Recently reading Jin Shengtan's essays, I only feel that he is simply telling the truth, frankly and honestly, which may be pleasing, but not necessarily extraordinary. If it is said to be extraordinary, it is only extraordinary in disregarding the ridicule of the mediocre and not thinking about his own life and family.

Most people say that Saint sighed is an extraordinary person, a talented scholar, but in reality, it is only because people are too vulgar, timid as mice, and overly value their own livelihoods. Saint sighed is definitely not an extraordinary person, nor is he a talented scholar. The fact that people regard Saint sighed as an extraordinary person and a talented scholar is precisely what Saint sighed was unlucky about. The reason why he suffered an unexpected tragedy was precisely because of this.

When I was young, reading Saint sighed's arguments, I also thought that he had an aura of strangeness. Reading it again today, I only feel that it is easy to understand and close to human feelings, not as violent, arrogant, absurd, and bizarre as the arguments that are commonly heard and read today. This is probably because when I was young, I first read the Bible and the biographies of sages, and I thought that the human world was really like that, mistaking the ideal for the fact. Later, I realized that what the ancient sages said was about things in another world. Therefore, reading the Bible and the biographies of sages again today, the more I read them, the more I feel that what they say is strange and astonishing, not as close to reality and relevant to reason as Saint sighed's.

Today, if adults still think of Saint sighed as an extraordinary person and a talented scholar, that person must be a junior high school student who has not been away from the past for a long time and is still wandering in heaven, or else he is a mentally retarded person, a hypocrite, a bad egg, an evil man, an old cunning fox, a long-term thief, who deliberately proclaims that Saint sighed is an extraordinary person and a talented scholar, and their intentions are unspeakable.

### Economic Resources Cut Off, Impoverished Student Earnestly Seeks Employment

Editor: I am a struggling student studying at a certain university in this city. My family is from outside the customs. Years ago, for the sake of a desire for knowledge, I left Beiping and came to Shanghai to take the university entrance examination. Fortunately, I was admitted. My father was originally an accountant in a factory, but the factory was dissolved last year, and he became unemployed. The livelihood of a family of five is naturally very serious. But my father still made the greatest effort to maintain my unfinished studies. Now it is the start of the school year, and the school requires tuition fees as usual. Because my economic resources are entirely dependent on my family, I had to write home. I earnestly hoped that my family would find a way to raise this money for me. After waiting for ten days, I received a letter from home. The letter paper had only a few lines written on it: "Father's strength has been exhausted. Today, I am ashamed to pass the responsibility of a father to you. Without food for a day, my hand is too weak to write more! All I feel before me is a blur...

Child, take care!"

A blanket and a cotton coat were both pawned. I finally racked my brains to find a way to pay the tuition fee, but how should I solve the problem of living expenses in the future?

Editor, I hope you can help me so that I can use my spare time to do some work. There are very few things that I am qualified to do, but I am very willing to be a Mandarin tutor, secretary, primary and secondary school teacher, and hospital intern. I do not expect any special treatment, only to be able to maintain the minimum standard of living. I wish you good health. Ma Jun, September 20th.
