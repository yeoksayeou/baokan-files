### President Summons Kuomintang Legislators for Talks to Discuss Government Policy; Weng Wenhao Attends and Reports, Emphasizing the Determination to Reform Military and Administration to Ensure People's Livelihoods are Stabilized

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] Prior to reporting to the Legislative Yuan, Premier Weng Wenhao explained his administrative policy to Kuomintang legislators on the 7th and exchanged opinions. At 9:00 AM on the 7th, when the Kuomintang Central Committee held its memorial week, Kuomintang legislators were summoned to attend. After President Chiang led the ceremony, a discussion was held. The President first explained the significance of holding the discussion, hoping that the legislators could discuss Premier Weng's administrative policy in advance and provide opinions. Subsequently, Weng presented his report. Weng particularly emphasized that the government is determined to make reforms and improvements, cooperate with the Legislative Yuan, and strive to stabilize the people's livelihood and quickly achieve the task of suppressing the rebellion and national reconstruction. Weng continued to point out that the Executive Yuan's administrative policy was formulated based on the national reconstruction policy announced by the President upon taking office, which includes: (1) Strengthening military affairs, boosting morale, and enriching equipment and rations are necessary to suppress the rebellion. While the amount of military grain is insufficient, technical aspects must also be improved. In addition to relying on US aid for grain subsidies, the requisition and borrowing of grain must continue. (2) The ordinary budget and special budget for finance are being drafted by the relevant departments. The main financial policy is to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Increasing revenue means rectifying tax collection, increasing tax sources, simplifying procedures, and implementing taxation on goods. Reducing expenditure means reducing the number of personnel in various government agencies. Although it is difficult, the first step in the future must be to limit the employment of personnel, and then define the scope of work for each person, so that everyone has something to do. (3) In the financial sector, measures to reform the currency system should be formulated as soon as possible to ensure that after the reform, floating capital is brought into line and channeled into legitimate industrial and commercial activities. Foreign exchange must still be subject to control, and import and export controls will also be strengthened. (4) Economic construction will be strengthened in South China. Efforts should be made to remedy the industrial and mining facilities that have been severely damaged by the communist bandits. (5) The land policy in the pacification zone is based on the equalization of land rights in the Three Principles of the People, and it should be properly handled in the future. (6) Agriculture should be supported to increase production. Tea and silk will be improved, and chemical fertilizers will be used. (7) Foreign policy hopes to strengthen the United Nations organization and promote Japan to become a democratic country to promote world peace. After Weng's report, legislators Huang Qiang, Di Ying, Qu Zhisheng, Huang Yuren, and Du Xunlao expressed their opinions. Some believed that attention had not been paid to education and culture, while others believed that domestic affairs had been neglected, especially the local conscription system should be reformed. Some believed that foreign policy was not clear enough and lacked independence. Finally, the President announced that if the legislators still had any opinions, they could submit them in writing to the secretariat for compilation and report to the Legislative Yuan on the 11th. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 PM.

### Legislative Yuan to Continue Meeting Today; Discussing the Prompt Implementation of Currency System Reform and Other Important Proposals; Executive Yuan Unable to Submit Budget Proposal in the Short Term

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] The eighth meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 8th. The matters to be discussed will include the following proposals: (1) Proposal by Liu Butong et al. to request the government to immediately levy a temporary property tax to equalize social wealth and save the country from danger. (2) Proposal by Qi Zhihou et al. to improve military affairs and strengthen the suppression of rebellion, proposing that the Legislative Yuan or a joint Legislative and Control Yuan organize a military investigation team. (3) Proposal by Zhao Huimo et al. to request the Executive Yuan to strictly order the financial authorities to report their private property. (4) Proposal by Huang Jianzhong et al. to amend Article 6 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law and Articles 3 and 4 of the Legislative Yuan Committee Organization Law regarding the provisions for specialists and staff. (5) Proposal by Hu Qiuyuan et al. to establish a special committee by the Legislative Yuan to review the gains and losses of national administration since the victory in the war, in order to clarify the origin of the turmoil and its nature, and to reform the foundation and save the country from danger. (6) Proposal by the Presidential Office to request retroactive recognition of the imposition of martial law in Guangyuan. (7) Proposal by Fu Jingyan et al. to promptly implement currency system reform to save the current political and economic crisis. (8) Proposal by Zhang Zhijiang et al. to establish a special committee to review prices. (9) Proposal by Liu Zhen et al. to request the government to find a way to coordinate and solve the employment problems of this year's graduates from colleges and universities, so as to make the best use of their talents and avoid wandering and displacement.

In addition, the Secretariat will report on the Executive Yuan's reply to the Legislative Yuan's deadline for submitting the budget proposal. The reply frankly stated to the Legislative Yuan that the drafting of the budget proposal is affected by the budget estimates of the Presidential Office and the Legislative, Supervisory, Judicial, and Examination Yuan, making it extremely difficult to complete it before the 15th, and even before the end of the month. This report will cause the Legislative Yuan to consider postponing the recess or adjourning early, and reconvening after the budget proposal is submitted. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan originally planned to listen to the Executive Yuan Premier Weng Wenhao's report on the Executive Yuan's administrative policy on the 8th, but due to insufficient preparation, it has been decided to postpone it to the 11th for another hearing and questioning.

### British Newspaper Comments on China's Currency System Problem

Believing that Reform is Futile Without Stopping the War

[British News Agency, London, 7th Dispatch] The Manchester Guardian recently published an article titled "Today's Monetary Inflation in China," stating that Chairman Chiang admitted at the end of March this year that the total amount of Chinese legal tender issued was 70 trillion, which is double the increase in January and 50,000 times more than in 1937. It is obvious that China's currency system will not be reformed, and there is no hope for recovery. However, the currency system reform itself is of little use. If the civil war does not stop, monetary inflation will absolutely not be stopped. If the civil war stops, the Chinese government can increase production and balance revenue and expenditure.

### Abolition of the Land Tax in Kind System is Not Yet Timely

Qu Zhisheng Expresses His Opinion

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th Dispatch] Since the land tax in kind was restored in the 33rd year, the results have been declining every year. The amount collected in the 33rd year was less than the quota, and in the 34th year, it dropped to 87%, 76% in the 35th year, and only 63% of the quota in the 36th year. When the members of the Legislative Yuan's Food Administration Committee met recently, some people often advocated abolishing the land tax in kind system, and there was a brewing of proposals. The reporter inquired about this with Qu Zhisheng, the convener of the committee, who said: Since the implementation of the land tax in kind, the results have not been as ideal, but in this period of suppressing the rebellion, it is obviously difficult to stop the collection in kind. In the future, food administration should strive for reform, but before the currency system is reformed, the collection in kind should continue.

[Our Report] Ropke, Director of the China Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration, and the eleven members of the Steelman Investigation Team, arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 PM yesterday. Those who went to the airport to welcome them included Wu Guozhen, Yu Hongjun, Bei Zuyi, Chen Guangfu, Huo Baoshu, Huang Renlin, and American personnel including Acting Consul General Bilger, Chinese Relief Mission Director Kilpatrick, and US Information Office Director Connors. The giant plane landed at 2:10 PM. After the ordinary passengers had left, Ropke appeared at the gate. With a youthful face and white hair, he was full of energy and shook hands with the welcomers as a courtesy. He also took several photos in groups and individually at the request of Chinese and foreign reporters. Before Ropke and his party arrived, the American authorities here had settled with the Beijing authorities that Ropke, Steelman, and Kilpatrick would fly to Beijing together at 10:00 AM today. At noon, they will visit Premier Weng Wenhao and attend a banquet. In the afternoon, they will visit Ambassador Stuart, and then Ambassador will accompany Ropke and others to meet with the President, and attend a banquet hosted by the President in the evening.

Funds for Aid to China Have Been Reduced; Efforts Are Being Made to Restore the Original Amount

Ropke and the Investigation Team hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at the Hua Mao Hotel at 5:30 PM. Ropke first stood up to report, briefly saying that he was very happy to be in China and humbly said that he still needs to learn everything after coming to China. Hoffman was asked to take on the task of assisting China because he grew up in San Francisco, where there are many overseas Chinese, and he had frequent contact with them. He also served as mayor of that city for four years and only resigned in January of this year. For this reason, he entrusted this matter to him. After accepting the new position, Ropke went to Europe to handle private affairs and reported to Washington on May 24. In the six days since then, he had many talks with relevant people, including Deputy Secretary of State Lovett and former UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Director Cleveland, and decided to come to China as soon as possible for on-site inspections. Regarding the future work policy, Ropke said that because the funding and aid period have not been determined, it is difficult to answer at this time. He expressed deep regret over the reduction in US aid figures and strongly stated that he himself, Hoffman, and the creators of this bill are trying their best to restore the original amount. He also said that in the future, the handling of US aid will be coordinated with Ambassador Stuart at any time, just as Hoffman coordinated with Secretary of State Marshall when promoting aid to Europe. Regarding the issue of establishing an agency, Ropke did not make a definite statement yesterday. But he expressed the hope that he could get the assistance and cooperation of Kilpatrick. The Chinese Relief Mission will end this month, and some of its personnel will join the new agency providing aid to China, including Kilpatrick himself. The latter has two years of service experience in China and has achieved remarkable results during his tenure. In the future, he hopes to obtain his guidance and cooperation in at least some special departments. Finally, Ropke said that he had just come to China, and all work still needs to be carried out slowly. He asked all parties to postpone their opinions for the time being.

Steelman Investigation Team Had Planned Three Construction Projects

Steelman continued to report, expressing his honor to be in China. He also said that he spent 30 days studying the records of construction projects undertaken by the Chinese government in the past before coming to China. He also consulted with Zhou Yide, Wedemeyer, and officials from the State Department and the Export-Import Bank, including Byrde White, Luckhardt, and Chinese representatives in the United States Gu Weijun and Li Qian. The first thing to do after coming to China is to ask Hoffman for instructions on the scope of work of the investigation team in China. When it was discussed in the United States in February this year, it was planned to use 60 million US dollars to carry out three construction projects in China, namely (1) Establishing a joint power company in Shanghai to increase power by 100,000 kilowatts. (2) Reconstructing the Yuehan Railway. (3) Developing two coal mines south of Hankou along the Yuehan Line. In addition, a plan to establish a rural construction committee was also proposed. However, so far, the funding and plan have not been finalized. All of the above construction projects are of a demonstration nature, and the content will be decided by Ropke. There is a lot of work that the investigation team is eager to promote, and it will submit new suggestions to Hoffman at any time based on the information obtained. The reception ended at 6:30 PM. At 7:00 PM, Bei Zuyi hosted a banquet at his private residence to welcome Ropke and his party. Mayor Wu and the leading figures in the financial circles in Shanghai were invited to participate. Ropke and his party stayed at the Yanghua Mao Hotel last night.

Wang expressed his adoption and explained that some matters were already being handled. He said that since his previous resignation had not been approved, he would inevitably overcome difficulties and devote himself to reforming military and political affairs, establishing a new style, and coordinating Shandong from top to bottom to do its best in terms of human and financial resources to achieve the goals of suppressing the rebellion, saving the province, and building the country.

Chengdu
(Our correspondent) The price of rice in Rong has risen sharply in the past week, from 8 million yuan per double stone on the 1st of this month to 16 million yuan on the 7th, a doubling increase. In addition to urging price stabilization, the provincial government will seal up all warehouses.

Lanzhou
(Our correspondent) After the adjustment of the salaries of Gansu county-level public education personnel, counties lacking food during the period of food shortage will be uniformly issued county-level food stamps by the provincial government, divided into three types: one stone, five dou, and four dou. People can use them to pay land tax, but they are only allowed to circulate within their respective counties and must be redeemed by the end of this year. This measure will be implemented after being approved by the provincial affairs meeting.

American Experts Will Fly to Chongqing to Examine Yang Mei's Alleged Fasting
(Our Chongqing correspondent, 7th) Dr. Liu Ruiheng, former Director of the Health Department and current Chairman of the American Medical Aid to China Association, recently sent a letter from Shanghai to the Central Hospital in Chongqing, forwarded to Director Li Zhiyu, stating that the association was very interested in Yang Mei's fasting and that the matter had caused a sensation in the United States. It was decided that American experts would be sent to Chongqing in the near future to investigate and examine her, and special consent was requested. Li replied in a letter expressing his welcome and providing details. This alleged fasting case is likely to be uncovered soon due to Dr. Liu's attention.

(Central News Agency, Peiping, 7th) Regarding the nine-year fasting of Yang Mei in Chongqing, Li Zong'en, a famous Chinese professor of internal medicine and President of Peking Union Medical College, told reporters today: "I don't believe such a thing exists. Living animals need to maintain metabolism. Without food, there is no nutrition, and new cells cannot be replenished. The legend of Yang Mei's fasting is inconsistent with the entire scientific concept and is not worth making a big fuss about, so I have not paid attention to this matter." He also stated: "(1) The Chongqing Health Bureau only sent a nurse and not a doctor, which was inadequate. Moreover, according to rumors, there was no one guarding her at night during the first few days of the test, which is a loophole. (2) Three weeks of fasting, only drinking liquid beverages, and being able to maintain life, but healthy people can also withstand three weeks of fasting. Three weeks of fasting cannot prove nine years of fasting. (3) What the peanuts in Yang Mei's pocket were for was not investigated clearly." Li believes that if it is proven that Yang Mei absolutely does not eat, four or five experts and several nurses must be invited to conduct a rigorous re-examination for at least three or four months before a conclusion can be drawn.

Allied Occupation Forces Will Not Withdraw Until German Security Is Guaranteed
Steps Taken to Complete Political and Economic Unification: Contents of West German Provisional Agreement Announced
(Reuters, London, 7th) The communique of the London Conference of six countries (Britain, France, the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) discussing the German issue was simultaneously released by the six governments on the 7th. Copies of the communique have been submitted to all interested countries, including the Soviet Union, for reference. The main recommendations agreed upon at the meeting listed in the communique include: (1) The immediate establishment of a German constituent assembly to draft a constitution applicable only to the three occupation zones of West Germany. (2) The Ruhr region should be under international control, with Germans participating in the management of Ruhr industries. (3) Immediate measures should be drafted to prevent German re-aggression. The communique acknowledges that the final merger of the French-occupied zone with the British and American-occupied zones is desirable, but also recognizes that this cannot be achieved for the time being until the current economic difficulties are clarified. The communique also specifically stipulates that the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will henceforth discuss all German-related tasks with the three Western Allied powers simultaneously, and will be given equal status according to the extent of their interest in German affairs. The communique also formally mentions the withdrawal of Allied forces from Germany for the first time, stipulating that after the withdrawal of Allied forces, an inspection system will continue to be implemented to ensure Germany's compliance with the provisions of the peace treaty.

The communique also lists the following matters under separate headings: (1) The organization of the Ruhr control system should enable Germany to participate in various activities, including executive activities, to a greater extent in the near future. (2) Foreign trade in the three zones of West Germany should be promoted as quickly as possible, and all unnecessary restrictions should be removed so that goods can flow freely across the borders between the zones. The six countries acknowledge that it is too early to raise the issue of economic merger at present, but economic merger will still be the overall goal. (3) The governments of Britain, the United States, and France will not withdraw from the agreements on overall German security concluded with the Soviet Union. Within the scope possible, the three governments will continue to seek international discussions with the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to study the security issues related to Germany. (4) Since Germany is a part of Europe, and from the perspective of Europe's industrial capacity, the Ruhr is the most important part of Germany, efforts should be made immediately to increase the production of steel, coal, and other minerals that the Ruhr has always supplied to Europe in large quantities. (5) Every measure will be taken to ensure that the governments can appropriately participate in the international control of the Ruhr, but the final status of the Ruhr should still be determined by the peace conference. In addition, under the heading "Germany's Final Political Evolution," the communique further suggests that Germany should gradually move towards more mature political independence, provided that measures are taken simultaneously to prevent German re-aggression. The communique does not directly mention the date of the Allied forces' withdrawal from Germany, nor does it explicitly mention the currency reform in West Germany.

(United Press, London, 7th) The British Foreign Office announced that a draft of the six-nation agreement on Germany was delivered to the Soviet Ambassador to Britain by the Foreign Office before it was released. It is generally expected that the recommendations of the London Conference will be met with swift protests from the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union may take retaliatory action. The Soviet Union is currently working to win the favor of the Germans in its East German occupation zone.

(French News Agency, Moscow, 6th) The Truth Daily commented on the six-nation conference on Germany today, saying that "the resolutions of the London Conference are in conflict with important international agreements and will inevitably be rejected by all freedom-loving people." The Truth Daily editorial continued, "The German people, in the voting, expressed that the vast majority demanded unification, opposed division, and opposed the organization of a Western German entity. Therefore, they will also reject the resolutions of the six-nation conference."

Britain Approves West German Agreement
France's Left and Right Wings Strongly Oppose, Schumann Cabinet Faces Serious Test
(United Press, London, 7th) Officials announced today that the Cabinet has quickly approved the six-nation agreement on Germany today. Fierce debate has broken out in France, with both the de Gaulle faction and the left- and right-wing communists expressing opposition, calling it a "national crisis," but Parliament is expected to approve it in the end.

(United Press, Paris, 6th) French Prime Minister Schumann is facing the most serious week since his government was formed, as Parliament will debate the tasks of the London Conference on the German issue or the issue of subsidies for Catholic schools this week. The most serious test may occur on the 8th, when Parliament will begin the debate on foreign policy issues.

(United Press, London, 7th) Authoritative sources say that if France refuses to accept any part of the six-nation provisional agreement on West Germany, it will force all contracting parties to re-examine the entire agreement. The agreement specifically states that its provisions "are interdependent and are an indivisible plan." Approval by Britain and the United States seems to be a foregone conclusion, and neither government needs to submit it to Parliament for approval, as this agreement is not a treaty.

(Reuters, Paris, 6th) The de Gaulle faction has joined forces with the French left-wing factions today to oppose the French government's approval of the London six-nation conference agreement on the future of Germany.

Bariwski, a spokesman for the de Gaulle movement, said in a speech in Narbonne, southern France, today that the recommendations of the London Conference cannot be an acceptable compromise between British and French opinions, and that the resolution has abolished France's opinions on its national security and the needs of Western European recovery. Under these circumstances, it is not factually possible for France to accept. Earlier, the left-wing mouthpiece "Direct Talk" also advocated rejecting the approval of the London Conference agreement, stating that the agreement would hinder peace between the United States and the Soviet Union. French cabinet members generally agree to approve the London agreement, but the opposition movement launched by de Gaulle and others and the left-wing is enough to make enough parliamentarians jeopardize the support that the government can obtain. President Oriol's speech yesterday did not express any preconceptions about whether or not to approve it.

Defense Minister Resigns, Cabinet to Change
(Reuters, Istanbul, 6th) Political figures expect changes to the Turkish cabinet after Defense Minister Belsel resigned yesterday. Currently, the positions of three ministers in the cabinet are vacant, and Turkish Ambassador to Italy Igin and Ambassador to the United States Besel will soon be transferred.

Soviet Officer Visits Refugee Camp, Pelted with Stones and Cursed
(United Press, Munich, 6th) According to a U.S. military spokesman, when five Soviet officers inspected the Mittenwald refugee camp today, more than 300 refugees threw paving stones at them, cursed them, and shouted, "Report the whereabouts of our mothers (or brothers) and then persuade us to return home."

Smuts Arrives in London
Will Assume Position as University Registrar
(Reuters, London, 7th) Former South African Prime Minister Smuts arrived in London from South Africa today and will assume the position of Registrar of Oxford University. Although Smuts is old and has recently suffered political setbacks, he is still in good spirits. After getting off the plane, he said that he did not believe that South Africa's new Prime Minister Malan would take South Africa out of the British Commonwealth. When asked why South Africa was willing to change its government at this time, he replied that this was the trend of the world today, and it wanted to change to fresh blood.

Hungary and Hungary Will Conclude Mutual Assistance Treaty
(United Press, Sofia, 7th) Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Kostov announced that Bulgaria and Hungary will soon sign a mutual assistance agreement. Bulgaria and Poland concluded a similar treaty on the 29th of last month.

McCarran et al. Will Fight for Foreign Aid Bill in Senate Appropriations Committee
Republicans Avoid Stimulating Public Opinion
(Reuters, Washington, 7th) The U.S. government and Senate leaders today launched a final do-or-die battle in the Senate to overturn the foreign aid appropriation bill that has been passed by the House of Representatives. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, Secretary of State Marshall, and Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman will all testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee in succession to demand the restoration of the original amount that has been passed by both houses of Congress. Well-informed political figures believe that the Senate will be able to restore some of the cuts made by the House of Representatives, and even restore all of the cuts. However, the most critical moment is when the House and Senate convene a joint conference to discuss a compromise appropriation bill. People here admit that the most important factor in the foreign aid bill crisis in the coming days will not be the opinions of the government or Congress, but the debate. Because elections are only a few months away, people in Congress are unwilling to stimulate public debate in support of the Marshall Plan. Another important factor is the Republican Party's attempt to avoid internal divisions before convening the National Convention. The differences of opinion among Republican congressmen during the House debate on the appropriation bill last week have surprised the party leaders. Republican leaders will not allow a conflict to reoccur in the Senate between the liberal faction led by Vandenberg and the conservative faction led by Taft. This is because in the November election, the Republican Party must show its voters that although the Republican Party has not been in power for sixteen years, it can still propose and implement consistent domestic and foreign policies that are worthy of the trust of the country and the world.

Eisenhower Takes Office as President of Columbia University
(United Press, New York, 7th) Former Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower took office as President of Columbia University today without holding a ceremony, but a grand ceremony will be held when he officially takes office in October this year.

(United Press, New York, 6th) According to public opinion analyst Winner, Eisenhower, who has repeatedly stated that he does not want to run for president, can be elected president on either the Democratic or Republican side if he intends to try.

Asian Economic Commission Passes Proposal to Admit Nepal
(Reuters, Oudtshoorn, South India, 6th) The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, on the motion of the Indian representative and seconded by the U.S. representative Grady, recently passed a recommendation to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, to which the commission belongs, to allow Nepal to participate in the Asian Economic Commission.

United Nations Delegation Returns to Seoul from Shanghai
Report to the United Nations Completed in Five Chapters
(Central News Agency, Seoul, 7th) The United Nations delegation to Korea returned here by plane from Shanghai today, arriving at 3:30 pm. The delegation stated that it had completed the first five chapters of its report to the United Nations General Assembly in Shanghai, including the political situation in Korea, a review of the observation of the May 10th general election by the delegation, and will continue to study the political situation after the general election.

(United Press, Seoul, 7th) The United Nations Commission on Korea returned here from Shanghai by plane today, and South Korean National Assembly Speaker Rhee Syngman led the welcoming party. The Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on the 8th to hear reports from the Rules of Procedure and Constitution Committees. The Commission did not comment on the statement by Philippine Deputy Commissioner Roña that he would attempt to conduct elections in the Soviet area.

Czech Communists Exert Authority, Feeling Bitter
President Benes Resigns; Government Claims It Is Due to Health Reasons
(Our report) London, 7th Broadcast: Prague, Czech news, President Benes' resignation is due to his unwillingness to accept the "People's Constitution." The government is expected to issue a communique on the President's resignation shortly, but there is no hope that the content of Benes' resignation letter will be released.

(Our report) London, 7th Broadcast: Prague news, Czech Prime Minister Gottwald said that he deeply regretted President Benes' resignation, and that this feeling was the feeling of the entire government. Gottwald said that Benes had to resign from his position as president due to health reasons, and the government could only express its agreement, but the Czech people would never forget Benes' great contribution to democracy and freedom. Gottwald pointed out that Benes was at the forefront of resisting the bourgeois class of farmers and Hitler's Germany, and had experienced hardships in the past years, but his political beliefs were finally realized. Benes was elected president in 1946 and served a seven-year term.

(Reuters, Prague, 7th) Reliable sources said that President Benes' opposition to Prime Minister Gottwald's doctrine had become increasingly open recently, and he seemed to have decided to resign without waiting for him to sign the new constitution, and to hand it over to the cabinet and Prime Minister Gottwald to announce. After Benes' resignation, Gottwald is expected to succeed him as president, and the Communist Party will thus gain control of all key political positions in Czechoslovakia.

Nehru Announces Opposition to Hyderabad Independence
Decides to Include It in India
(United Press, New Delhi, 6th) Indian Prime Minister Nehru told a crowd on the 6th that the Indian government would not allow Hyderabad to be an independent country. Before Nehru made this sharp remark, he met with Hyderabad Prime Minister Ali on the morning of the 6th, and Ali presented him with the latest reply from Hyderabad on this important negotiation. Nehru told the conference that the government had decided that Hyderabad must join India following the example of other Indian provinces. "India cannot tolerate the existence of an independent country within its borders." At the same time, Nehru denied the rumor that Governor-General Mountbatten's departure from India on June 21 would be a signal for the resumption of war between India and Pakistan. He said that these rumors were spread by anti-socialists, and the Indian government was prepared to deal with any disturbances by "all possible means."

After US Eliminates Funds for Japanese Reconstruction, Japanese Cabinet Drafts Stabilization Plan to Make Good Impression on Investing Countries
(United Press, Tokyo, 7th) Prime Minister Ashida is rushing to draft a plan to attract private investment from abroad to Japan. The Japanese cabinet had to take this countermeasure after the U.S. government cut aid to Japan's economic reconstruction.

If Ashida wants to prevent minority parties from pushing for the overthrow of the prime minister, he must quickly implement this plan. The reason why the current Japanese cabinet has been able to overcome many difficulties in the past few weeks is that the expected U.S. aid has had the effect of turning danger into safety politically. Although the U.S. House of Representatives has not rejected all the funds requested by the military for Japan, it has cut the $150 million in aid specifically used to rebuild Japan's economy. Ashida and his Democratic Party cabinet members were hit hard by this move by the United States, so they immediately began to implement the "Temporary Economic Stabilization Plan." According to this question "disclosure", the purpose of this temporary economic stabilization plan is to make foreign investment have a good impression of Japan, based on the following guidelines: (1) Labor disputes must be eliminated and smooth labor-management cooperation must be promoted; (2) More effective trade procedures must be developed; (3) The bad phenomena of increasing wages and adjusting prices must be eliminated; (4) Production costs must be consistent with world figures, and the basis for exchange rates must be laid.

Saudi Arabia Joins Arab League in Fighting
No New Developments on Holy Land Fronts
(Reuters, Amman, 7th) In military terms, the Saudi Arabian Legion joined the battle group in Palestine. After operating with the Egyptian army in the Negev area on the southern front, it has advanced to the Egyptian mobile team in Bethlehem, and has also advanced to the new urban area of Jerusalem to assist the Jordanian Legion in fighting and bombarding the southern suburbs of the new urban area. The Syrian-Lebanese coalition forces on the northern front have also advanced, occupying several Jewish villages and towns. There are no major new developments on other fronts.

(French News Agency, Tehran, 6th) According to reports here today, Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi has agreed to sell ammunition to Iraq at the request of the Iraqi Prime Minister for use in the war in Palestine.

New Comet Appears, Three and a Half Times Larger Than the Moon
(New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 7th) At around 3:30 pm on the 6th, the Japanese Observatory discovered another new comet with a magnitude of 3.5. The tail is more than three and a half times larger than the moon and can be seen with the naked eye.

Israeli Party Leaders Agree to Request Soviet Aid
Military Figures Say New Blow Will Be Given to Arab Army
(Central News Agency, Tel Aviv, 6th, United Press) The Israeli army is preparing to give a new blow to the Arab armies in central and southern Palestine at a time when its parliamentarians have declared that they are preparing to request Soviet aid. Israeli parliamentarians recently stated that the leaders of all Israeli parties passed a resolution at a meeting on the evening of the 3rd of this month to request assistance from the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies.

Israeli far-left and far-right figures are now unanimously agreeing to request that all countries that recognize the country provide concrete assistance to this newly born Jewish state. The United States and the Soviet Union have now recognized Israel, but the U.S. embargo on arms shipments to Palestine, which was issued before the establishment of Israel, is still in effect.

Transjordan King Criticizes US and Soviet Governments in Holy Land
Believes US and Soviet Support for Jews Is All for a Purpose
(United Press, Cairo, 6th) According to reports from Arab on the 6th, King Abdullah of Transjordan severely criticized the Palestinian policies of the United States and the Soviet Union in a meeting with reporters after receiving UN mediator Bernadotte. Abdullah said that both the United States and the Soviet Union support the Jews for their own secret purposes. He pointed out that President Truman's recognition of the Jewish state was a political action and asked: "Is this man's support for the Jews only because he wants to be elected president again?"

Bernadotte Asks Arabs and Jews for Ceasefire This Thursday
Limits Both Sides to Answer in Forty-Eight Hours
(Our report) London, 7th Broadcast: Cairo news, UN Palestine mediator Bernadotte said today that he had verbally submitted the ceasefire plan to the Arab and Jewish leaders and is now submitting it in writing. He expects to receive a response within forty-eight hours. In addition, the Jewish and Arab armies are stepping up their operations in order to gain a favorable position before the ceasefire. It is rumored that the ceasefire order may take effect on the 10th.

(United Press, Cairo, 7th) UN mediator Bernadotte has today submitted the start time and conditions for a four-week ceasefire in Palestine to the six Arab countries.

(United Press, Tel Aviv, 7th) Cairo, 7th news, UN mediator Count Bernadotte has drafted a compromise agreement to end the Arab-Jewish war and will ask both sides to accept or reject it within forty-eight hours.

Bernadotte held multiple meetings with both sides in Beirut, Haifa, and Amman on the 6th. Upon arriving in Cairo, he said: "I have verbally told the Arab and Jewish leaders about the plan. Now I am submitting the plan in writing. I hope to receive a direct and clear answer within forty-eight hours." Unofficial sources say that the success or failure of the Earl's plan depends on one question: whether or not Jewish immigrants who are currently in Haifa should be allowed to land in the Holy Land. Unofficial reports state that the time of the ceasefire was originally set for noon on the 7th (local time), but Bernadotte and Arab Legion leader and King Abdullah of Transjordan changed the final time for the ceasefire to the 10th (Thursday noon, local time) at a meeting in Amman on the evening of the 6th. At the same time, news from Amman stated that Transjordanian Foreign Minister Mulki was ordered to fly to Cairo on the 7th with a special letter from Abdullah to present to Egyptian King Farouk. Mulki will stay in Egypt for four days, during which he may attend a special meeting of the Arab Legion Political Committee.

(Reuters, Amman, 6th) Bernadotte has traveled between Cairo, Amman, Beirut, Haifa, and Tel Aviv for six days, and his proposed truce agreement with both Jews and Arabs seems to be taking shape. Although Bernadotte declined to explain the contents of the truce negotiations when he went to Haifa from Beirut today, he admitted that the situation was very promising. The news from Chenggong Lake revealed that Kuri, the Syrian representative to the Security Council, received a phone call from Bernadotte saying that he hoped that a truce could be expected soon. It is also rumored in Chenggong Lake that unless the Arabs and Jews agree to a truce within days, the Security Council may recall Bernadotte within the week. Some representatives believe that the Security Council should listen to Bernadotte's personal report to explain where the stalemate was created.

US and Afghanistan Envoys Are Promoted to Ambassadors
(US News Service, Washington, 6th) The U.S. Legation in Afghanistan has been upgraded to an embassy, and Afghanistan has appointed King's cousin, Neim Khan, the former envoy to Britain, as the first Afghan Ambassador to the United States.

British Quirky Old Laws Recommended for Abolition by Upper House Members
(British News Agency, London, 7th) The full text of the Law Amendment Bill submitted to the Upper House ten days ago was published yesterday. The laws involved in this case range from 1235 to 1800, and have never been formally abolished. If this case is passed, the ancient laws of more than seven hundred years will be quickly eliminated. Many of the laws listed in the case seem strange today. For example, one of Edward III's laws states that the land and people of England should never be subjugated to the King of England, like the King of France. There is also a law on the loss of civil rights for those who murdered the late King Charles I. This "failed coup" has not been forgotten to this day. Year after year, the partisans loyal to James II must hold a memorial ceremony in front of the King's statue in Trafalgar Square on January 30. The phrase "putting in the pillory" will be deleted. It can also be seen that 18th-century Yorkshire grocers did not pay much attention to the accuracy of butter weights and packaging. One of the most bizarre laws in today's era of nationalized railways is George III's patent allowing Watt's invention of the steam engine for twenty-five years. George II's decree also stipulates that every pint of beer is taxed two pence, which shows that beer was also expensive at that time.

Shipowner Impoverished, Doing Good Deeds
On Eve of Monkhood, Generously Donates 1,000-Ton Sailing Ship
English Relief Charity Foundation Holds Reception Ceremony Yesterday
(Our report) The English Relief Charity Foundation Management Committee of this city received a new An'an cargo-passenger ship (see picture) worth US$100,000 yesterday. The donor will go to a temple in Hangzhou to become a monk after recovering from his illness in Shanghai for two months. This is a very generous and bizarre good deed. During the Anti-Japanese War, Japan plundered as many as 200 ships in various parts of our country. After active investigation by our delegation, only four ships that survived were recovered. One of them was named "New An'an", with a deadweight of 1,450 tons, which was just received by the China Merchants Bureau in May last year. However, because the time was too long, it was impossible to know who owned the ship. Then, the Bureau inquired everywhere, and finally learned that the owner was Wang Zhongying, the owner of the Qingwu Yingji Shipping Company (see attached picture), and the Bureau officially returned the ship on July 17 last year.

Wang currently lives in a pavilion room at No. 7, Lane 572, South Shaanxi Road, this city. During the Anti-Japanese War, all the company's ships were looted, all his property was lost, and his family suffered a terrible change. Wang barely escaped and went to Chongqing alone, where he lived in poverty. After the victory, he moved to this city, but his situation was still extremely difficult. However, recently, due to his poor health and seeing Mayor Wu's enthusiasm for charitable undertakings, he suddenly decided to unconditionally donate the ship to the English Relief Charity Foundation Management Committee of this city. The picture shows the full view of the New An'an ship. The upper left corner is the donor Wang Zhongying ( ).

Mayor Visited the First Terminal in Person
Yesterday afternoon at 4 pm, the reception ceremony was held at the first terminal of the China Merchants Bureau in Tilanqiao. More than ten people attended, including Mayor Wu, who also served as the chairman, as well as Man Yuanfang, Dong Hefu, Du Yuesheng (represented by Yang Ying), Xu Xueyu, Ouyang Zunquan, Huang Muzong, and Wang Zhongying himself. Mayor Wu left early due to other important business, and the ceremony was changed to be presided over by Du Yanfang. The donor Wang Zhongying, the recipient Du Yuesheng, and the witness Huang Muzong solemnly signed and sealed the donation contract. Then, photos were taken and refreshments were served, ending this very meaningful ceremony.

Owner Talked About the Motivation for the Donation
Afterwards, the reporter inquired Wang about his motivation for donating the ship. According to reports, Yingji Shipping Company owned five passenger and cargo ships before the war, which often sailed between Qingdao, Fuzhou, and Shanghai, and its business was very developed. After the war, he went to Chongqing alone, and came to Shanghai after the victory. Since suffering a major shock, he has been superstitious about fate. He said that his ancestors for three generations were all enthusiastic about charitable undertakings. When it came to his generation, he suddenly suffered a change and his family fell into decline. He deeply believed that the blessings of his ancestors could no longer protect him. At the same time, he said that among the four ships returned after the Japanese pirates looted more than 200 ships, there was still one of his own. He said that this was also due to the virtues of his ancestors, and it was definitely not something that he himself could enjoy.

After Experiencing Hardships, All Thoughts Were Grey
He now has heart, liver, stomach, and brain diseases. If he is not careful in his daily life, he will become ill. On the one hand, he has no strength to continue operating, and on the other hand, he believes that since he has been able to survive in pain and hardship for more than ten years, all his thoughts are grey, and he is no longer interested in things outside his body. He also told reporters that Mayor Wu has instructed him to stay in the hospital for recuperation for two months. Once his illness is slightly cured, he plans to go to Hangzhou to enter the mountains and become a monk in a temple. However, he hopes that the English Relief Charity Foundation Management Committee can make good use of this ship to help the poor and run schools, which can also help him fulfill his only wish in this life.

Bai Chongxi Came to Shanghai to Treat Dental Diseases
(Our report) General Bai Chongxi came to Shanghai this time to treat his dental diseases. Yesterday afternoon at about 3 pm, he and his entourage drove to the Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing, Xuhui for sightseeing. The company's general manager, Xi Guansheng, entertained and gave them a tour. General Bai inquired in detail about the company's recent business, and especially commended the company's contribution to the production and supply of canned food to the military during the Anti-Japanese War. He then returned to

Study of Dewey's Common Sense and Science by Shao Xiong

American contemporary philosopher Professor John Dewey, now nearly ninety years old, continues to write and publish articles. Western philosophers possess astonishing energy, remaining vigorous in old age, which is truly admirable. Recently, in the April 8th issue of "The Journal of Philosophy," he published an article titled "On Common Sense and Science Their Respective Frames of Reference." The content is not overly specialized, making it worthwhile to introduce to "Xuejin" readers. A brief summary of its main points follows:

Dewey believes we should regard both common sense and science as "transactions." This term "transaction" has both passive and active connotations. From a passive perspective, "transaction" indicates that neither common sense nor science is an entity, a completely self-contained and isolated thing. In other words, common sense is not a thing, nor is science a thing, but rather a process, a transaction. We cannot regard common sense and science merely as subjective psychological functions or processes, nor can we regard them solely as objective realities completely unrelated to human activity. They are neither purely subjective nor purely objective. From an active perspective, "transaction" indicates that the nature and characteristics of common sense and science are similar to those recognized in any "transaction." In any "transaction," such as a commercial transaction, one party is determined to be a buyer and the other a seller. Unless there is a transaction and participation in a transaction, no one is a buyer or seller. Buyers and sellers cannot exist independently of the "transaction." Secondly, special things also become goods or commodities by participating in this transaction. If no things become goods by participating in a transaction, we have no so-called commercial transaction. Furthermore, in a transaction, both the buyer and the seller are changed, and the status of the goods is also changed. Finally, no transaction exists in isolation but is related to other transactions. These points are characteristics of "transaction," and at the same time, they are also characteristics of common sense and science.

Common sense is a "transaction," a transaction between people and people, and between people and things. Only by participating in this transaction can humans become familiar with other humans and things. This "familiarity" gained through participation in transactions can be said to contain knowledge and more than knowledge; it is the practical activity of life in suffering and struggling. According to the Oxford Dictionary, common sense has been defined on the one hand as "the general awareness, feelings, and judgment of humanity or a nation"; on the other hand, it has been defined as "good, sound, and practical awareness in dealing with everyday events." Combining these two definitions can express the true meaning of common sense. The so-called "common" in common sense refers to the everyday events in a group, which constitute the common life of this group, and "sense" is not just "feeling," not just static awareness, but is related to action. Activities such as humans using water to quench thirst, washing things with water, and using water to carry boats all demonstrate common sense. What common sense involves is the common use and enjoyment of humanity or a certain group. In these uses and enjoyments, common sense does not strictly separate humans and the universe, inner and outer, self and non-self, subject and object, individual and society, private and public. From the perspective of common sense, these oppositions are both sides of life's transactions and cannot exist independently of the transaction. Traditional philosophy insists on separating these oppositions, which is a mistake of philosophy ignoring common sense.

Common sense is a transaction, and so is science. The difference between science and common sense is definitely not that common sense is a human event, a human transaction, while science is not. In fact, science is also precisely a human event, a human transaction. Science is human work, it involves human work, and this is very obvious. Secondly, the difference between science and common sense is also definitely not that common sense emphasizes action, while science emphasizes knowledge. Knowledge and action are equally important for both common sense and science. Common sense also values knowledge, but the knowledge of common sense is to enable daily necessities to proceed, and its relationship with action is more direct. Science also values action, but the relationship between science and action is more indirect. Science indirectly promotes action by directly pursuing knowledge. If we say that the knowledge of common sense is practical, and the action of science is theoretical, this is also acceptable. We must understand that the so-called "practice" is not always application, but also includes aesthetic experience; and the so-called "theory" is not merely pure speculation, but also includes practical action. "Scientific knowledge is a special form of practical human activity, which involves the promotion of knowledge while being detached from other practical events." In other words, the difference between science and common sense is the difference between H2O and water for quenching thirst and washing things. Science involves H2O, while common sense involves water for quenching thirst and washing things. What the former involves is what the latter involves. Although the former may not be directly related to daily life, daily life can be enhanced by the former. Science promotes knowledge, but it is definitely not knowledge that is unrelated to action. The problem is that the transition from knowledge to action in science is not necessarily beneficial to humanity. For example, the knowledge of atomic energy is a good example. Here, the philosopher's task is how to promote the return of science from knowledge to action, reducing its negative impact and increasing its positive impact. This is the conclusion of Dewey's article.

Leisurely Thoughts on the Lake (II) by Gu Ou

Spirit and Matter

Humans often use terms but are unable to clearly explain their meaning at the moment, and "spirit" is one such example.

Spirit is contrasted with matter, so let us first talk about matter. Broadly speaking, matter is something visible to the eye, audible to the ear, and tangible to the skin and limbs. If spirit is contrasted with matter, then spirit should be something invisible, inaudible, and untouchable, and if it is invisible, inaudible, and untouchable, then it can only be known and verified through inner awareness. Therefore, we say that spirit is something invisible, inaudible, and untouchable that can only be known and verified through human inner awareness. This thing, in terms of what is being known, is non-material, and in terms of what is capable of knowing, is also non-material. To put it plainly, it is merely the self of human inner awareness and verification. The so-called inner heart is actually just the awareness and verification that is still aware and verifying that awareness and verification. Neither the knowing nor the known contains any material components, and therefore both are equally invisible, inaudible, and untouchable. I will explain this in more detail below.

Life is contrasted with matter. Matter is without consciousness, while life has consciousness. It can also be said that grass and plants have consciousness, but their consciousness is in a numb and comatose state. The consciousness of animals gradually becomes clear, gradually breaking away from the state of coma and numbness. However, it can only be said that animals have consciousness, not that they have a mind. It is not until humans that there is a mind. Consciousness arises from receiving external impressions, while the mind is formed by self-awareness and verification. Therefore, in the consciousness of animals, there is only the material world, not the spiritual world. Spirit only exists in the human mind. In terms of the ability to know, we often confuse the terms human mind and spirit, which is acceptable.

How is the human mind developed and completed? Originally, humans also only had consciousness and no mind. In other words, like animals, they could only receive the concrete material world that is visible, audible, and tangible. When those visible, audible, and tangible external materials disappeared, their consciousness of those materials also disappeared. Only when other visible, audible, and tangible materials come into contact with their ears, eyes, and bodies can they have another new batch of consciousness emerge. In short, consciousness is largely passive and fleeting. Only when those consciousnesses become impressions and remain without disappearing can consciousness be transformed into memory. Memory is simply consciousness knowing its past consciousness. In other words, it does not generate consciousness from external concrete materials, but rather from past consciousness to know again, which is memory. The function of memory only begins to develop in humans. When humans have memory, they begin to have a mind. The mind is not the brain. The brain controls consciousness. What the brain perceives is the external material world. The mind is the accumulation of consciousness, and the mind's consciousness gradually detaches itself from what is given by the material world and becomes independent. Therefore, the mind can perceive itself, which is to perceive its past retained impressions, which is the ability to remember. Thus, we can say that memory is the beginning of human spiritual phenomena.

How can humans retain the impressions generated by their consciousness of the external material world and generate recollection and remembrance? Here, an important tool is language and writing. The function of language can identify external impressions and make them clearer and deeper, and at the same time, it can also multiply them. Some higher animals are not unable to have memory and remembrance, but they are vague and general, not clear, not deep, or they are limited to simplicity, unable to be broad and unable to be multiple. Why? Because they do not have language and cannot divide and classify their external impressions, giving them order and categories. For example, if you have many things or many events and cannot record them in an account book, you will inevitably become vague, forget, and lose them. Because humans invented language, they can classify all external impressions, giving each a call and a name. Thus, material images gradually remain in the inner layer of consciousness and transform into mental images, which gradually merge into the spiritual world. It can also be said that mental images are concretely manifested in sounds, making them objective. Writing is the symbolization of language. From the existence of writing, with those symbols, the function of the mind has grown increasingly. Humans use sounds (language) to classify impressions, and then use pictures (writing) to replace sounds. With language, there is external identification of the mind, and with writing, there can be external memory of the mind. In other words, it is to concretize and objectify the functions of identification and memory into language and writing. Therefore, we say that from consciousness (the initial manifestation of the mind's function), language (including writing) is slowly produced, and then from language (including writing), the mind is slowly produced. This mind is spirit, and its function is also spirit.

If humans do not have language, they cannot have memory. Even if they can have memory, it is like that of other animals, not the high-level memory of humans. When you are remembering, it is no different from silently speaking in your heart. With memory, you can then have thought. Memory is the material of thought. If the mind is empty of memory, what materials will you use to think? Human thought is also just a silent speech in the mind. If there is no language, then thought becomes impossible. Thought is just silent speaking. Other animals cannot speak, therefore they cannot think. Humans can speak, therefore they can think. According to common sense, it should be the human mind that is thinking, and after having thought, it is then expressed in language and writing. But if we look at its source from a distance, we should say that humans developed thought because they had language and writing, and because you have thought, you realize that you seem to have a mind. The heart in physiology is just a place where blood gathers and disperses, and the brain in physiology is the center of consciousness. Neither is the mind discussed here. From the brain in physiology to the mind in the spiritual world, a large part is due to language and writing.

Because there are language and writing, human awareness can communicate with each other and become a large collection. The narrow and short human mind becomes broad and long-lasting. The human mind's abilities have jumped out of their brains and are placed outside the supra-physical. If you treat the human mind's functions as flowing electricity in the sky, then language and writing are like electric wires and storage batteries. Those flowing and scattered electricity emit great functions because of storage batteries and electric wires. This mind is broad and long-lasting, supra-individual and external. All humanistic evolutions originate from this mind. Therefore, we call this the spiritual world.

This mind of the spiritual world is supra-individual and also non-material. Why? Because humans have language and writing, they can contact the memories and thoughts of another person outside. This is self-evident. If we believe that memory and thought are entrusted to language and writing, and developed and completed from language and writing, then language and writing are common and public to humans and cannot be divided into yours and mine. For the same reason, we can also say that memory and thought should also be common and public to humans in essence and cannot be forcibly divided into yours and mine. In other words, the human brain and hands belong to the physiological and material aspects, which can be divided into yours and mine, but the human mind is non-physiological and belongs to the spiritual aspect, which is common and public in essence and cannot be forcibly divided into yours and mine. To put it plainly, the so-called mind is nothing more than an accumulation of various memories and thoughts, and various memories and thoughts are completed by using language and writing. Language and writing are not privately owned by me, so how can the mind become privately owned by me? As long as you are familiar with the common language and writing of your society and group, you will accept various memories and thoughts of your society and group. Those scholars who have extensively read classics and are proficient in history and philosophy, not to mention them here, even for an illiterate person, as long as he can speak, he has accepted immeasurable various memories and thoughts of his society and group, which fill his brain and form his mind. Suppose there is a person who is born deaf and never hears external sounds, so he cannot learn language from the beginning, and therefore cannot recognize writing. In terms of psychology, it can only be said that this person has a brain, but it cannot be said that he has a mind. He should only have consciousness, not memory and thought? Even if he has memory and thought, he can only be like other higher animals. According to what we discussed above, it can only be said that he can only contact the external material world, but cannot contact the external spiritual world, that is, the human spiritual world. Therefore, he is only a person with a brain but without a mind, only a person who lives a material life but cannot contact a spiritual life.

Based on the above, spirit is not something that exists innately in the natural world, but rather exists in the historical evolution of humanistic society. However, for an individual, it does have a supra-egoic objective existence. In other words, it is indeed innate.

### Aristotle's Theory of Individuals and Reality by Yi Zhi

In Aristotle's mind, the universe evolves. Therefore, the individual he describes is "new every day and different every year." In the process of evolution, matter and form have different levels of hierarchy. The individuals formed from them also have different degrees of elevation. These levels of elevation are produced by the two principles of potential and reality. For example, mud is matter, the shape of a brick is form, and when the two combine to make a brick, it is an individual. Further, the brick becomes matter, the shape of a house is form, and when the two combine to make a house, it is an individual. And so on, and you see that an individual becomes matter, adds form, and becomes a new individual -- the entire universe is formed in this way. Individuals, whether high or low, are the object of academic study. Matter, no matter how big or small, has form within it, and form, no matter how high or low, is what learning seeks. Socrates sought concepts, Plato sought ideals, Aristotle sought forms, and even today science seeks general rules -- it's all the same thing, the only difference being the level of elevation. What our Confucian scholars call "investigating things to understand principles" can be explained in Aristotle's words as finding form in individuals. If we use modern scientific terms, "things" can be seen as data, and the word "investigating" includes methods such as analysis, synthesis, induction, and deduction, and "principles" are principles and general rules. -- Our Confucian scholars certainly couldn't achieve this degree back then, but the general trend is always the same.

Aristotle considered the individual to be reality, which is a huge key in his system: (1) Recognizing the individual as reality restores the value of the natural world, and thus science can be produced. (2) Recognizing the individual as reality means that form and matter are both here anyway. In this way, Plato's dualism is refuted, and his own monistic philosophy is formed. From the perspective of intellectual history, Aristotle's proposition can be said to have surpassed the ancients and opened the way for future generations. The philosophers before Socrates sought the elements of all things in the natural world. Although they tacitly acknowledged the reality of the individual, they did not know how to seek abstract principles. Socrates and Plato knew how to seek abstract principles, but because they opposed their predecessors, they deliberately looked down on the individual and did not regard the individual as reality. It was not until Aristotle that he could avoid the drawbacks of bias, acknowledge the reality of the individual, and at the same time know how to seek abstract principles, with principles being sought in the individual. This points out the path for all subsequent learning. (To be continued)

### Jottings from the Academy (25) by Zhang Qiyun

Historian and History Writer

In October 1944, the author returned to China from the United States and purchased Russell's new book "A History of Western Philosophy" in a bookstore in Los Angeles. Accompanying this painting amidst the sea and sky, sailing was frequent, and I often pondered it after relaxing. Russell began writing this book before World War II, and it was published after the war ended. After reviewing the entire book, the author's mind was filled with the dark clouds of war. He had deep concerns about the human heart and world. Looking back on the past and present, his emotions were extremely sincere, inspiring boundless admiration in readers. He believed that thought is not secluded meditation, but rather the dynamic expansion of political and social life. It is both a product of the times and a contributor to the creation of new times. Without a thorough understanding of the background of a certain era, one cannot fully understand the origins and currents of a certain thought. Thought is indeed the core of cultural spirit, and the history of thought is the history of culture. This new book can be regarded as Russell's new evaluation of Western culture and can serve as a reference for psychological construction during our nation-building period.

There are history writers and history scholars. Academic history scholars mostly adhere to the principle of narrating but not creating. History writers are different, using history as a foundation and emphasizing talent and insight. Talent refers to writing style, and insight refers to arguments. History writers seek the truth of history, valuing careful textual research. However, limited by their efforts, they mostly conduct narrow and deep research. History writers, when writing history, must first enrich historical materials, and of course, they must gather all relevant textual research from various schools, integrating them to achieve the effect of collecting essence and using it broadly. However, history scholars eliminate superficiality, hoping to narrate matters factually, while history writers focus on writing style. Russell said of Descartes, "His writing style is exceptionally beautiful and approachable, and it is truly a delight that the founder of modern philosophy has such writing talent." We also have the same delight with Russell's own monumental work on the history of philosophy. History scholars do not lightly make judgments, avoiding personal opinions. History writers, on the other hand, emphasize praise and criticism, valuing weighing the facts, with lofty arguments penetrating the ages, presenting past events to inform those who come after, with profound meanings and wonderful insights following one after another, establishing themselves as a school of thought. Russell's book adopts a lecture style that mixes narration and argumentation, and it would not be inappropriate to call it a history of Western philosophy.

The characteristic of Russell's book lies in its emphasis on the contributions of thinkers to the human heart and world. For example, the philosophy of the Dutch philosopher Spinoza is intrinsically more valuable than that of the Englishman Locke, but Locke's theories opened the way for the revolutions in England and France, and their impact was far greater than Spinoza's. Therefore, this book elaborates on Locke's theories in detail, while its description of Spinoza's theories is more concise. The Englishman Byron and the Frenchman Rousseau, strictly speaking, are not worthy of being called philosophers, but their thoughts once shook their times. If one does not know Byron and Rousseau, one cannot understand the development of modern philosophy. Therefore, a chapter is dedicated to each of these two to discuss them. Furthermore, Russell believes that a categorical narrative, not leaving out anything, inevitably leads to simplicity and sloppiness, which is of little benefit to readers. Therefore, he is very strict in selecting historical materials, cutting and editing them extensively, omitting many common names in ordinary histories of philosophy. As for the figures mentioned in this book, their lives and social environments are described in great detail, often narrating their anecdotes to reflect the spirit of the times.

Russell's entire book is divided into three parts: ancient, medieval, and modern, with a total of seventy-six chapters and more than 300,000 words. To understand the broad structure and main threads of Western culture, this is a must-have book.

### How to Implement US Aid Effectively!

—Expectations for Mr. Lapham

Mr. Lapham, the Executor of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, along with Mr. Steelman of the Chinese Economic Survey Team and a group of over ten experts, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. They will soon organize an economic cooperation team in Shanghai to begin implementing aid to China. Thus, the long-awaited U.S. aid by our country's government and people has entered the implementation phase due to the arrival of Executor Lapham. Therefore, we cannot but express a warm welcome to Mr. Lapham and his group of over ten distinguished guests with the utmost sincerity. At the same time, we would like to offer some suggestions before the implementation of the aid to China plan for Mr. Lapham and his colleagues to consider.

Mr. Lapham is a first-class American industrialist and former mayor of San Francisco. He has achieved remarkable success in both politics and business. This time, he has come to China to take on the task of implementing the aid to China plan. He will certainly be able to fulfill this task satisfactorily. Both the Chinese and American governments and people hold ardent expectations for Mr. Lapham's coming to the East to take on this arduous task. However, Mr. Lapham has never been to China, and having received the order from Economic Cooperation Administrator Hoffman in haste, he has not had the opportunity to thoroughly consider the actual situation in China. Therefore, we hope that after Mr. Lapham arrives in China, the first step should be to understand the actual state of the Chinese economy. It must be understood that China is an industrially backward country. Before the War of Resistance, due to the economic aggression of the great powers, agriculture declined and industry stagnated, and the national economy was already on the verge of bankruptcy. During the War of Resistance, China fought arduously for eight years, and although it achieved final victory militarily, the economy was even more devastated. Half of the country was under enemy occupation, and both agriculture and industry and commerce suffered from enemy destruction and devastation. After the victory of the War of Resistance, there should have been a period of rest and recuperation to first seek economic recovery and then talk about economic revitalization. However, the communist rebellion followed one after another, plunging the national economy into a state of irrecoverable ruin. The severity of the economic crisis actually exceeded the most dangerous period during the War of Resistance. If economic assistance from friendly countries cannot be obtained, not only will economic recovery be hopeless, but also the total collapse of the economy will be unavoidable. The Chinese Communist Party's plot to drag down the government's economy through rebellion and thereby seize power could then be fully realized. This is the reason why the Chinese government and people are eager for U.S. aid; this is also the reason why the American government and people are eager to aid China. Therefore, we are willing to speak frankly and tell Mr. Lapham directly that the few months before the implementation of the aid to China plan, that is, the next two or three months of the lean season, are actually the most difficult period for our country's economy, and also the current challenge for our new Prime Minister Weng Wenhao's cabinet. Mr. Lapham should maximize administrative efficiency and quickly begin implementing the aid to China plan, so that this difficult period can be shortened to the minimum. However, yesterday at the press conference, we heard Mr. Lapham say that before starting implementation, he needs to plan carefully and that everything will have to wait until he meets with Ambassador Stuart before any decisions can be made. In theory, Mr. Lapham is right. Everything should be carefully planned from the beginning, and good results will only be produced after thorough deliberation. However, the actual situation of the Chinese economy is such that delayed help is of little use. If it is further delayed, it may deepen the Chinese economic crisis. We hope that Mr. Lapham will pay special attention to this point.

In recent years, we have been most concerned about the United States' foreign policy, and every move in Washington has been closely watched by us. Since President Truman publicly announced his anti-communist stance in March of last year, the United States' foreign policy, whether in Europe or Asia, has been based on the "Truman Doctrine." In other words, the policy that the United States is implementing in Europe is a two-pronged approach of supporting and aiding Europe; the policy that the United States is implementing in Asia is also a two-pronged approach of supporting Japan and aiding China. However, there are slight differences in emphasis. In Europe, the United States emphasizes aiding Europe over supporting Germany; but in Asia, it emphasizes supporting Japan over aiding China. The growing suspicion of some people in Chinese society about the United States' support for Japan is not entirely without reason. Therefore, we hope that Mr. Lapham, after coming to China, will understand the psychology of the Chinese people and will not confuse the debate against the United States' support for Japan with anti-American sentiment. If Mr. Lapham can have this understanding, it will not only help the implementation of the U.S. aid plan but also facilitate communication between the people of China and the United States.

When the aid to Europe plan was about to be implemented, the U.S. House Appropriations Committee suddenly decided to cut foreign aid funds, including a cut of $63 million to the aid to China fund. Not to mention the people of European countries who felt puzzled, the Chinese people were even more surprised. Although Senator Vandenberg is currently trying to restore the original amount, and Secretary of State Marshall and Administrator Hoffman will also testify before the Senate, it seems that there should be no problem; however, the joking style of American congressmen always makes the countries receiving U.S. aid feel deeply uneasy. Mr. Lapham also said yesterday that the total amount of the aid to Europe fund has not yet been decided, and naturally, nothing can be discussed. It goes without saying that this will affect the progress of the aid to China plan. Therefore, we hope that Mr. Lapham, after coming to China and witnessing the actual state of the Chinese economy, and then considering the current world situation, can immediately speak to the U.S. Congress so that all members can understand that the aid to China fund can only be increased and not cut.

In short, how to effectively implement the U.S. aid plan is the responsibility of both China and the United States. In addition to strictly demanding our own efforts, we also hope that the U.S. side will provide as much assistance as possible, especially holding great expectations for Executor Lapham!

### Ganyu County Magistrate Lu Daofu Resigns and Leaves Lightly Armed

[Our Correspondent in Haizhou, 2nd] Lu Daofu, the magistrate of Ganyu County, had previously submitted a request to the special commissioner's office of this district for a week's leave for recuperation due to overwork. After the special commissioner's office received the request, it approved his stay in the area for quiet recuperation. However, the county magistrate suddenly left Xinpu lightly armed the day before yesterday, and his whereabouts are unknown, which has surprised all parties. In order to understand the inside story, the reporter specially visited related parties and learned that there are three reasons for Lu Daofu's departure: (1) Lu's concubine, He Jianzheng, came to Haizhou this spring, and due to emotional breakdown, the two became irreconcilable, to the point where they could no longer live together. Lu was deeply stimulated. (2) Recently, he received an urgent telegram from home, urging him to return to Suzhou within three days. Then, he received a telegram from a certain meeting of his county government in Nanjing, urging him to leave Haizhou as soon as possible. (3) Local people in the county were dissatisfied with Lu and jointly filed a complaint with the provincial government, which further prompted Lu to seek a quick return. Therefore, the day before yesterday, he hired a rickshaw to the Hongmen Station on the Haizhou Highway, waited for a long-distance bus to Xin'anzhen, and then took a train, disappearing to the south.

### Seven Hundred Canaries Gather in Suzhou, Divided into Groups for a Great Fight
