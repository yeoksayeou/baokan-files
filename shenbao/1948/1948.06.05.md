### On the Student Anti-American and Pro-Japanese Movement; US Ambassador Issues Statement; Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Reiterate Our Position on Japan Today

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 4th] US Ambassador Stuart made a statement at 11:00 am on the 4th at the US Embassy, ​​advising students engaged in the anti-American and pro-Japanese movement. The ambassador's statement was approved by the US State Department. The official reaction in the capital is generally good. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that a statement will be issued on the 5th to reiterate China's position on the Japanese issue and oppose the US's views on Japanese policy in order to clarify the communist bandits' conspiracy and instigating propaganda, so that pure students and people from all walks of life can understand the truth of the facts and avoid this matter from continuing to be used by the communist bandits as a tool to alienate Sino-US friendship.

Opinions of Government Officials

In addition, reporters visited important government officials and asked for their opinions. Premier Weng Wenhao of the Executive Yuan said that he hoped that the students would be enlightened by Ambassador Stuart's advice. Today is an era of fighting to the death against the communists, and they must not be instigated and used by ambitious people. China has an unswerving independent position on the Japanese issue and will never follow the United States. Young students and people from all walks of life should avoid being confused by anti-American propaganda. Political Committee Member Dong Xiankuang said that the Chinese government will resolutely stop any unscrupulous activities that engage in anti-Americanism under the pretext of the Japanese issue. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua said that he only returned to work at the ministry on the 4th after dispelling his intention to resign, and he still needs to understand the students' activities. However, the Ministry of Education has paid attention to it. The target of Ambassador Stuart's statement is mainly student groups, so there is no reaction from people in the business community in Nanjing. However, a senior diplomat to Japan told reporters that anti-Americanism and pro-Japaneseism are two different things. Under the current world situation, it is unwise to conduct anti-Americanism for any unwarranted reason, which violates the general trend of the world and the interests of the country and is not worth emulating. However, the act of supporting Japan is difficult for both the Chinese government and the people to agree with. Judging from Japan's recent behavior, if Japan is slightly indulged, it is very easy to embark on the road of economic aggression again. Fortunately, the so-called Strike Plan and Draper Plan are just reports from a few officials and have not been adopted by the US government as a principle to change its policy towards Japan. Otherwise, if Japan's cunning plan succeeds, it is not what China wants, nor is it a blessing for the world. Therefore, in terms of the policy towards Japan, our country must adhere to its position, and the diplomatic authorities should make a statement to inform the people and the world.

Our Policy Towards Japan Remains Unchanged

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 4th] Regarding the US's support for Japan, voices of opposition are frequently heard from all sides. A certain authoritative person in the diplomatic circle recently talked to reporters about our country's policy towards Japan from a diplomatic point of view, saying that our policy towards Japan has long been determined. No matter how the policies of other countries are, we will maintain the following two principles: (1) In the peace conference with Japan, we must reserve the right to veto; (2) Our policy towards the treatment of Japan has always been generous, but the meaning of generosity is not to allow Japan to rebuild its military power and restore its aggressive power, but to enable Japan to maintain peace and democracy, and within the scope of peace and democracy, enable the Japanese people to obtain a living standard that meets the standards.

Contents of the Ambassador's Statement

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 4th] US Ambassador to China Stuart published a statement at a press conference at the US Embassy on the morning of the 4th (excerpt): I am now forced to publicly acknowledge with a sincere and heavy heart a growing dangerous situation. This situation not only affects the interests of the United States, but also affects the vital interests of China. What I am referring to is the movement against the US policy towards Japan.

I do not pretend to know who initiated this movement and what its purpose is. What I know for sure is that this action has seriously damaged the harmonious friendship between China and the United States. If it continues, it may lead to unfortunate consequences. What is even more regrettable is that this kind of action is happening at a time when the United States is embarking on a broad and solemn plan to assist China, which is in a tragic situation.

I do not want to believe that the universities that initiated and echoed the anti-American movement believe the reasons they use to oppose our country. Our country is accused of supporting Japan and restoring its warlords and economic imperialism. This accusation is obviously wrong. After the victorious end of the war against Japan, the United States immediately represented the Allied countries that destroyed Japan's military power and began to dismantle the organizations of the Japanese army, navy, air force and staff. I don't think anyone can present any evidence that any part of Japan's military power is currently being restored. Nor can anyone present any evidence that the United States has any intention other than to ensure that Japan's military power will never rise again. The foundation of Japanese aggression lies in its imperial territories outside its homeland. Now that Japan has lost its imperial territories, it cannot re-establish them without military power. The American people and government will never allow it to do so. You can rest assured.

As for Japan's economic and industrial capabilities. The United States has also, on behalf of the Allied countries, begun to destroy or dismantle its wartime industries. We are now encountering a situation where we must restore Japan's economy to the extent that the Japanese can be self-sufficient. No one can expect American taxpayers to continue to pay for the Japanese indefinitely. Japan must be given the opportunity to be self-sufficient, otherwise Japan will be a continuing burden not only to the United States but also to China. A country that cannot survive on its own is a threat to maintaining security and peace. A nation that cannot survive on its own will never become a peace-loving and democratic nation.

If the Japanese are made into a hungry and restless people, then Japan will continue to be a threat to peace. This situation is just what communism needs. If we are sincere in the interests of the general public, we must stop communism, then we must eliminate the factors that encourage communism. You and the American people have the same concern about Japan. We do not want a communist Japan, and the best way to prevent this disaster is to enable the Japanese to make a living on their own.

Ambassador Answers Reporters' Questions

After the ambassador announced his prepared statement, he also answered questions from reporters. The main questions and answers of the reporters are as follows:

Q: Regarding the four questions raised in yesterday's Central Daily News editorial "On the Anti-American Movement", can the ambassador express his opinion?

A: No comment.

Q: In the ambassador's observation, does the Chinese government have any actions to instigate this anti-American movement?

A: The Chinese government has never instigated this movement.

Q: Does your government intend to lodge a protest with the Chinese government?

A: The US government has no such plans.

Q: The ambassador mentioned in his speech that if the student anti-American movement continues, it will cause some unfortunate consequences. Can you explain what "unfortunate consequences" means?

A: (Answered by the spokesperson of the US Embassy) Currently, the American people are paying extra taxes with great enthusiasm to strengthen aid to China. If the student "anti-American movement" continues, this enthusiastic emotion may change.

Editorial: Distinguishing Between Pro-Japanese Anti-Americanism and the Anti-American Movement – After Reading Ambassador Stuart's Statement

Recently, the United States has become increasingly blatant in its statements about supporting Japan, which has aroused suspicion and criticism from some Chinese intellectuals regarding American policy toward Japan. Unexpectedly, the argument of "opposing American support for Japan" has been used by a small number of students in various universities in our country. Using this as a slogan, they have incited student unrest throughout the country, creating the current "anti-American movement," which is raging like wildfire and spreading everywhere, with a growing danger. If measures are not taken to control it as soon as possible, it may cause unfortunate consequences. Ambassador Stuart specially received Chinese and foreign journalists in Nanjing yesterday morning and issued a written statement. We have repeatedly read the original text and summarized its main points as follows:

(1) The dangerous situation caused by the anti-American movement not only affects American interests, but also affects China's important interests; (2) Although he does not want to know who is inciting the "anti-American movement" and what its purpose is, he firmly believes that this movement has seriously damaged the traditional friendship between China and the United States. Allowing it to continue will inevitably lead to very unfortunate consequences; (3) The accusations by college students that the United States is supporting Japan's restoration of military, economic, and imperialist power are all fabrications, and no one can provide concrete evidence; (4) If it is said that the recovery of the Japanese economy is enough to pose a threat to China's peace, it is also a wrong argument. If the Japanese people also become hungry and insecure, Japan will continue to be a threat to peace, which is exactly what communism is seeking. For the benefit of the general public, it is necessary to stop communism, and we must also eliminate the factors that encourage communism; (5) He urges Chinese students to be loyal to themselves and love their country. China needs the students' faithful efforts; (6) Finally, he declares that the ambassador's greatest wish is for peace and happiness for all mankind. If China and the United States cannot treat each other with sincerity, be friendly to each other, and trust each other, it will inevitably endanger the peace and happiness of mankind.

Ambassador Stuart's written statement is full of enthusiasm and is really too persuasive. It is not only earnest and sincere, but also completely from the heart. All good Chinese people who read the original text of his statement cannot help but be moved to tears. However, for the sake of clarifying the current situation and clarifying the understanding of the Chinese and American people, we must reiterate the facts in order to correct the vision of the Chinese and American people.

First, when commenting on the anti-American movement today, it is necessary to distinguish between two temporarily different facts. One is the anti-American movement incited by a small number of students, and the other is the suspicion and criticism of American policy toward Japan by some people in society. These two facts, which are completely different in nature, must not be confused. The former is a movement launched by a small number of students under the guise of "opposing American support for Japan." They are not for the benefit of China, but for the conspiracy of the Communist International. The CCP launched the anti-American movement as early as two years ago. Recently, because of the deterioration of US-Soviet relations and the United States' active military and economic assistance to the Chinese National Government, the CCP's anti-American movement has intensified. Now, these few professional students are willing to be military spies for the Communist bandits. When they encounter such a good opportunity, they will naturally use the general public's suspicion of American policy toward Japan to carry out their tricks of inciting the anti-American movement. Their purpose is obvious. On the one hand, they attempt to shift the attention of the Chinese people to the future prospects of the Japanese invasion train restarting, while ignoring the fact that our country's sovereignty over the Northeast territory is being harmed. On the other hand, they want to alienate the close friendship between China and the United States, and attempt to undermine the implementation of the US aid plan to China. Therefore, the echo in Stuart's statement, such as "China's important interests are also affected," "If [the movement] continues, it will inevitably lead to unfortunate consequences," etc., will not only not make these few professional students afraid, but will encourage their rebellious activities, because their purpose is not for the benefit of China at all. They want China's important surplus to be harmed, and they want to cause unfortunate consequences. The news that the House Appropriations Committee cut $63.3 million in funds is considered by these anti-American students to be a great success for their anti-sigh movement? Ambassador Stuart has a deep understanding of Chinese politics and understands the psychology of the people; but he may not be able to clearly recognize the role of this type of action. Therefore, we must especially point this out, and hope that the Ambassador and the people of the country can distinguish between pro-Japanese anti-Americanism and the anti-American movement, and must not confuse them.

Second, the recent American policy toward Japan, especially Stettinius's anti-reparations theory and Clayton's non-reparations theory, greatly relax the requirements for Japan's industrial level and the issue of Japan's indemnity. The consequences of this are not only that China suffers significant material losses, but also that the Chinese people see the enemy's resurgence and feel threatened in their spirit. The suspicions of the Chinese people are a natural phenomenon and cannot be eliminated; however, the activities of the general public are limited to raising opinions and have no anti-American implications. Moreover, after hearing Ambassador Stuart's statement, clarifying that the United States' policy toward Japan has no intention of supporting Japan's restoration of military, economic, and imperialist power, all doubts and fears can naturally be dispelled. However, the general public also expresses admiration for MacArthur's control of Japan and its existing achievements; but they always feel that "a gentleman can be deceived by his methods" and that MacArthur is in danger of being deceived by the Japanese. China has no intention of retaliation against Japan, but seeks a solid guarantee of peace in the Far East. This is the same as the United States' wishes for Japan, so we still hope that the United States can take into account the interests of China and pay attention to the psychology of the Chinese people, and increase vigilance against Japan to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression.

Third, the anti-American movement incited by a small number of students in universities across the country this time can give the American government and the public a valuable lesson, that is, the interests of the Chinese Communists and the United States in the Far East cannot coexist. Although the Communists have not yet seized political power in China, their ambition to exclude American interests in the Far East is obvious. If the Chinese government is once seized by the Communists, it is not difficult for us to imagine that the United States will inevitably be excluded from the gate of the Far East, and it will not allow it to say a word about peace and stability in the Far East. This fact is so obvious that if the United States wants to fulfill its responsibility for peace in the Far East, then intensifying aid to China to complete the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country is the only way out for the United States in the Far East. Therefore, we hope that Ambassador Stuart can have great foresight. The more fiercely the Communist bandits use professional students to oppose the United States, the more actively the US aid plan to China must be carried out. We must not relax our aid to China because of the anti-Americanism incited by a small number of professional students. The CCP's poison scheme to marry the Chinese government.

Finally, we still have to say a few words to our compatriots. Many difficult problems in China at present are not easy to solve for a while, which is enough to cause current worries; but the real crisis in our country's situation lies in the fact that the people of the country do not have a fair and sound public opinion on any issue. Taking this anti-American and pro-Japanese issue as an example, because there is no fair and sound public opinion, it not only fails to improve the country's vigilance against Japan and use the path of national diplomacy to awaken the United States' awareness of its policy toward Japan; on the contrary, it is used by professional students, which makes the problem itself change in nature and causes unpleasant feelings between Chinese and American people. Chinese intellectuals cannot be the backbone of the country and reverse the tide. They cannot shirk their responsibility for the occurrence and expansion of this anti-American movement. This is something that intellectuals across the country should deeply reflect on.

### Cutting Foreign Aid Hinders Recovery, U.S. Secretary of State Expresses Opposition, U.S. Violates Promises to Damage its Reputation, House Appropriations Committee's Suggestion Causes Repercussions

[Our Newspaper's Report] New York, 4th, Broadcast: Washington News, Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference today that after the House Appropriations Committee reduced the amount of economic aid to Europe, the European recovery plan would lose its constructive nature and become a relief plan. The government will do its best to prevent it from being reduced.

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The House Appropriations Committee recently recommended reducing the amount of the Maer Plan and other foreign aid bills proposed by the U.S. government by 25%. This recommendation also applies to aid to China and the European recovery plan. The committee's recommendation is seen in the appropriations bill passed by the committee, stipulating a total of $5.98071 billion in foreign aid for the fifteen months ending July 31, 1949. The committee reduced the amount of aid to Europe to $4 billion, a decrease of $245 million from the original amount, and reduced the amount of aid to China to $400 million, a decrease of $63 million from the original amount (see the first page for the part on aid to China). Although the reduction is only 7% of the original amount, the bill passed by Congress was originally for twelve months, while the committee's recommendation is for fifteen months, so it is actually a reduction of 25% from the original amount. The committee explained the reasons for reducing the amount and extending the period of use, saying that the original intention of the foreign aid plan did not allow spending more than what should be supplied based on a sensible foundation. If an emergency occurs before July 1, 1949, Congress will take necessary action when it convenes in January next year. Congressional figures believe that the House of Representatives will accept the committee's recommendation and pass the reduced appropriations bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee is still in the process of reviewing the appropriations bill for foreign aid. The government believes that the Senate will be able to restore part of the original appropriations. When explaining the reasons for the reduction, the House Appropriations Committee pointed out that since July 1, 1945, the United States has paid $18.1822 billion in foreign aid, which has weakened U.S. resources and wasted part of it. The committee's report also expressed dissatisfaction with the plan to mechanize foreign rural areas and criticized the reconstruction work in West Germany. The reduction in aid to Greece and Turkey was due to the large amount of aid previously provided to those two countries.

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] After the House Appropriations Committee announced the reduction in the amount of foreign aid, ECA Administrator Hoffman immediately convened reporters to give a speech, pointing out that the reduction in the amount of aid to Europe would affect the recovery opportunities of the sixteen European countries. The total amount of 5.3 billion yuan needed for the European recovery plan cannot be reduced. The current hope is only that the Senate can restore the original amount passed by Congress. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg is therefore discussing this matter with Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges, hoping that the Senate Appropriations Committee will not make a large reduction. Related parties said that Marshall Hoffman and even Truman will put pressure on Congress within days to reduce the dangerousness of the House Appropriations Committee's move and prevent the possible backlash against European public opinion.

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th Dispatch] The "New York Times," which has always had an international perspective, recently criticized the House Appropriations Committee's move to reduce the foreign aid funds already passed by Congress. The newspaper said that this reduction is tantamount to violating the promises made by the United States and the will of Congress. "The New York Times" accused House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber of bearing the blame, as he is largely responsible for cutting foreign aid funds. The newspaper said that foreign aid is extremely important and cannot be arbitrarily handled by Taber's narrow-minded approach. We expect both the House and Senate and the entire Republican Party to take responsibility for their actions, reject Taber's actions, and respect the promises they have made, so as to preserve the reputation of American foreign policy.

### Soviet "Cold" Suddenly Becomes Silent, Basic Policies Will Change, Generally Believed That the Situation Has a Turning Point

[United Press, New York, 4th] Howard Newspaper's foreign editor Sims reported: "It is believed that the Kremlin is planning to change its basic policies, allowing for the most significant change since the Soviet Union abandoned reconciliation with Britain and France in 1939 and united with Nazi Germany. News from outside the Iron Curtain all state that the Soviet Union's cold war against the West has suddenly fallen silent. News from Britain and the sixteen Marshall Plan countries reveals that the general situation has greatly changed, the likes of which has only been seen since the victory over Germany? Communist parties in countries west of the Soviet Union have also reduced their activities. It seems that the fifth column of the Soviet Union in Western Europe now has a sweet sense of rationality in mind.

Observers in various places reported that war talk in Western Europe has lessened slightly, but some also say that they still privately believe that this is the calm before the storm. The Kremlin must make a decision and it will probably be revealed soon. The worldwide shock of this resolution can be predetermined. Unless Stalin and his Politburo comrades decide that communism and free enterprise can coexist peacefully in the same world and revise their policy of conquering the world, they must take action as soon as possible, and they must strike hard, otherwise once the world begins to recover, they will be unable to stop it.

### U.S. House of Representatives Passes Navy Appropriation Case

### Britain Complies with Security Council Resolution to Ban Arms to the Middle East, Arabs and Jews Greatly Debate Ceasefire Terms

[Reuters, London, 3rd] On the 2nd, Britain announced an absolute arms embargo on the Middle East, based on the Holy Land ceasefire resolution passed by the Security Council on May 20th. The arms embargo order issued by the British Ministry of Commerce includes war supplies provided by Britain to Middle Eastern Arab countries under treaties, including industrial explosives that can be used for military purposes.

In early February of this year, Britain had already issued an absolute arms embargo to any party within Palestine, but this embargo did not apply to Arab countries that had signed war supply treaties with Britain. The British government's decision this time is based on the provisions of item 3 of the Security Council's May 30th resolution, which states: During the four-week ceasefire, the governments and authorities concerned shall not export or import war materials to Palestine or Arab countries. The items banned by the Ministry of Commerce include aircraft, aircraft engines and parts, bayonets, bombs, and bombing equipment, cannons, firearms, machine guns, and magazines, explosives, detonating cords, hand grenades, land mines, sea mines, flamethrowers, torpedoes, and certain military gases. The diplomatic reporter of this agency said: This ban by the British Ministry of Commerce is the second measure taken by the British government in accordance with the Security Council's resolution. The first measure was the announcement yesterday of the ban on Jewish young adults of military age from traveling to Palestine from British territory during the ceasefire period. Diplomatic circles here also said: Before the Security Council's ceasefire order began to be implemented, Britain expressed its belief that UN Mediator Bernadotte would be able to complete his mission.

The meeting adjourned after thirty-seven minutes. If necessary, it may reconvene on Monday.

### Paraguayan Revolution, President Overthrown by Army

### Truman's Speech in Chicago: Methods to Resist Communism

[United Press Truman Train, 4th] President Truman traveled westward on a special train on the 4th, embarking on a 9,000-mile tour to gauge public opinion on peace, prosperity, and politics. His first major stop was Chicago.

[Report from this newspaper] New York Radio Broadcast, 4th: Chicago Dispatch, President Truman delivered a speech here today, urging the American people to assist international refugees and calling on Congress to swiftly pass legislation enabling these people to find work in the United States and lead reasonable and healthy lives.

The President believes that charitable relief alone is insufficient to solve the problem and that active assistance is necessary to achieve success. Therefore, the American people must help them become self-sufficient and combine their efforts. Addressing the issue of communism, the President believes that merely passing laws to prevent its activities would, at best, only drive it underground and would not fundamentally solve the problem. If we fail to address the lives of ordinary people, it will inevitably lead to the rise of communism. The President stated that communism is a product of weakness, distress, and despair and cannot exist in a healthy society. The most effective way to resist communism is to continuously improve our democratic politics, such as improving public health, education, fair wage systems, and preventing inflation. The President concluded by expressing his confidence that America will achieve these goals.

Western investment and technological assistance to Asia should be freely available. No government's export policy should be bound by foreign policy. The British representative immediately guaranteed to provide all assistance to the Far East to promote industry, agreeing to focus on small-scale industries. The Pakistani representative also welcomed foreign assistance from any source.

### Landlords Association Believes that the Case of Rent Payment in US Dollars is Inappropriate

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the District Court's explanation yesterday that the Shanghai Restaurant should pay 1,000 US dollars in back rent for the New Xianlin Ballroom, which was considered appropriate, the reporter recently inquired about this matter from the Landlords' General Association. According to the person in charge, Yu Shunyu, regardless of when the contract was signed, it is inappropriate to pay rent in US dollars within the territory of the Republic of China. Even if the property belongs to foreigners, it should not be calculated in foreign currency now that consular jurisdiction and extraterritoriality have long been abolished. Furthermore, the Executive Yuan has recently issued an order prohibiting the use of gold and real objects as rent standards, and US dollars themselves cannot be freely traded. However, he did not express an opinion on the point that the law is not retroactive. As for the organization of the Landlords' Association, it is reported that Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs has submitted it to the Municipal Council, and it will be established soon.

### Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Reports: Gas Supply Improvement Plan – Give Priority to Expanding the Wusong Plant – Establish Another High-Pressure Pipeline

[Report from this newspaper] Zhao Zengjue (趙曾珏), Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, reported on the city's gas supply situation and preliminary improvement strategies at yesterday's municipal meeting, stating in brief: The number of gas users has increased sharply recently. Before the war, there were only a few thousand households, but now there are more than 20,000 households, and applicants are arriving one after another. In order to meet future needs, a gas technology conference has been established to draft a ten-year gas plan for the city, planning to build another Nanshi (南市) gas plant along the Huangpu River, with an estimated daily production capacity of 5 million cubic feet, which will be the hub of the city's gas supply. However, due to the large amount of funds required, it is difficult to proceed in the short term. Therefore, a temporary plan is proposed to give priority to expanding the Wusong (吳淞) gas plant. Over the past two years, the plant's daily output has increased from 100,000 cubic feet to 800,000 cubic feet. However, the Public Utilities Bureau believes that the existing gas storage and transportation equipment capacity of the Wusong gas plant is too small to meet the needs after increased production. Therefore, it has been decided to lay another 8-inch high-pressure pipeline from the plant's Ouyang Road (歐陽路) pressure regulating room to connect with the high-pressure pipeline of the Shanghai Gas Company, and to add a pressure regulating station in front of Tongji University (同濟大學) on North Sichuan Road (北四川路) to reduce the pressure, from which it will be transported in five low-pressure lines. This plan has been approved by the Mayor. The mechanical gasifier is expected to arrive around mid-October of this year and can be installed by the end of the year, which will increase the gas supply. Before the Nanshi gas plant is established, the Public Utilities Bureau has decided to lay a new pipeline from the corner of Guangdong Road (廣東路) by the Wusong gas plant to the Min Guo (民國路) Road in the Nanshi area to benefit the citizens of Nanshi.

For those related to public daily life, or those who the employer believes cannot take vacation, the employer should pay them double their wages, but if there are other customs in various industries, the total number of vacation days in a year exceeding the number of commemorative days shall be subject to their customs. (B) When the above workers are dismissed, they shall be handled in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Jing Lao Zi No. 31037 of May 8, 1947 (or negotiated by themselves; if the negotiation fails, they shall be allowed to refer to the method for dismissing workers with indefinite contracts in factories resolved at the second meeting of the association), but if there is an agreement in various industries, the agreement shall still prevail (according to the above two methods passed, because they are supplemental regulations to the Factory Law, they must be submitted to the Ministry of Social Affairs for implementation).

(3) Regarding the dispute over the shutdown allowance at the Donggou (東溝) chip factory of the Da Zhonghua (大中華) Match Company, it was assessed that it should still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the mediation record No. 578 of the Social Affairs Bureau.

### After the Prohibition of Using Bills as Collateral – The Monetary Control Bureau Spot Checks Returned Bills – And Strictly Inspects the Bank Drafts of Various Banks

[Report from this newspaper] Since the implementation of the measures to prohibit the use of bills as collateral on June 1, the market response has been good, and the financial market has also remained stable. The amount of returned bills on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd showed a decreasing trend. The amount of returned bills on the 3rd was reduced to 178 billion. A person in charge of the Monetary Control Bureau said: The average daily amount of returned bills this month will not exceed 100 billion. From the 4th, the Monetary Control Bureau will spot check returned bills to minimize them, and strictly inspect the bank drafts of various banks. The issuance of bank drafts must be based on customer requests or contractual relationships. If it is found that banks are issuing blank bank drafts, the manager and the person signing the bank draft will be immediately transferred to the court for strict handling, and all banks have been notified to pay close attention. It is also said that the increase in the circulation of bank drafts is irrelevant, because the issuance of bank drafts has a certain procedure, and absolutely no returned bills are allowed. As long as the amount of exchange decreases, it can indicate that the credit circulation rate has been greatly reduced, which has a significant effect on stabilizing prices.

### Negotiations to Reduce Tariffs on Bleached Silk for Sale to the US

[Nanjing, June 4, Report from this newspaper] There is considerable demand for bleached silk produced in China in the US market. However, because the current import tariff rate on bleached silk in the United States is higher than that on dyed and printed silk, it is impossible for bleached silk from China to be sold in the US. The reason is that preferential terms for bleached silk have not been included in all US foreign tariff agreements, so the tariff rate is 30-40% higher than that of dyed and printed silk. The Import and Export Control Committee has suggested to the Ministry of Economic Affairs that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should formally negotiate with the US government to reduce the tariff rate on this semi-finished product in order to maintain China's silk industry and facilitate the earning of foreign exchange. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant agencies to conduct negotiations.

Kerosene rose to 2.8 million per bottle.

### Sales in All Areas Are Stagnant – Rice Prices Initially Rise and Then Level Off – Flour Prices Vary, Miscellaneous Grains and Cooking Oil Are Slightly Stronger

The rice market showed a slight recovery, mainly because tin prices stabilized, arrivals were not active, samples were not numerous, and owners quoted higher prices. The market opened very strong in the morning, rising by about 100,000 yuan. However, rice shops did not accept well, sales were stagnant, and the price lacked the power to rise, so the market turned flat in the afternoon and finally rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. White japonica rice in the north market was 6.95 million yuan, rising by 50,000 yuan. Extra high japonica rice also rose by another 50,000 yuan, to 7.25 million yuan. Because the price of glutinous rice was high, goods from Zhaoyuan arrived in four batches, and supply exceeded demand, so the price fell by 100,000 yuan. 4,635 dan (石) of goods arrived in the two markets.

Flour prices are stable before the new wheat arrives on the market. Inland prices are average, so the market sentiment is not active, retail investors are indifferent, and sales are more than purchases. Traders in the north are standing aside, transactions are not taking place, and prices are slightly rising and falling. Lao Che flour fell by 10,000 yuan, Bingchuan flour was average, and the China Trust Bureau sold 9,200 bags at the original price. Miscellaneous brand flour mostly fell. Wheat bran was stable, and the factory price of wheat still stood at 2.7 million yuan.

Miscellaneous grains are firm and stable. The price of soybeans is stronger in the afternoon, because customers are absorbing, so the market trend is firm. Hankou Za beans closed at 3.6 million yuan, rising by 100,000 yuan, and Du beans did not increase. Corn continued the previous day's rise, rising again by 100,000. Red sorghum, new yuan wheat, new silkworms, etc. were all firm. Mung beans customers selectively absorbed secondary goods, and the market was average. Sesame seldom showed prosperity, and raw kernels were rarely traded. The retail price in the local market rose.

Cooking oil prices opened high and turned flat at the close, rising slightly. The morning opening price continued the previous day's rise, and owners still insisted on raising prices. Da You soybean oil opened at 16.2 million yuan, and the closing price retreated to 15.8 million yuan, 150,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Raw oil rose by 200,000, but transactions were not numerous. Raw vegetable oil and others all rose by 1-200,000 yuan, but small cart sesame oil fell back by 200,000 yuan in the afternoon. Bean cake factories had no supply, and the market remained firm at a slightly higher price of 1-20,000 yuan.

### Stable Sugar Prices

After the sugar market rose the day before yesterday, the decline was insignificant. Yesterday, it stabilized. The guild's quoted price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 9.6 million yuan, up 50,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half white was 10.075 million yuan, up a small 50,000 yuan. There were no fluctuations for No. 20 medium granulated white sugar. Other local sugars, such as Shantou Qingdiao Qing and Xinghua white, remained mostly unchanged. However, Hainan red sugar was in tight supply, with high-quality sugar quoted at 6.05 million yuan, and ordinary sugar at 5.75 million to 5.81 million yuan, with a total of 800 to 900 transactions.

### New Decisions on Payment Methods for Goods: Grain Industry

Payment on Day of Transaction with Crossed Checks on the Following Day

The joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the three guilds of the local grain, flour, bran, and oil industries, and the three market management committees, was held at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 4th) at the Grain Market at 377 Min Guo Road. More than 50 attendees, including Zhang Chao, Fu Changyu, and Cheng Zhenxiang, were present. Fu Changyu and Zhang Chao co-chaired the meeting. The chairman first reported that since the financial authorities implemented the ban on using same-day bills, although many businesses used promissory notes for settlement, it was often impossible for the buyer to rush to the bank to exchange the crossed check for a promissory note on the same day. This has led to delays in settlement and significantly affected business operations. Therefore, all attending representatives were asked to jointly discuss specific methods for the collection and payment of goods. After the representatives expressed their opinions, it was resolved that for transactions in the grain market, the buyer should deliver the goods purchased by 11:00 AM on the same day, and the seller should pay 80% of the goods with a crossed check the following day. For the flour, bran, and oil markets, the full payment with a crossed check on the following day is required.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders All Agencies to Prevent Textile Factories from Moving to Hong Kong

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] To prevent inland textile factories from moving to Hong Kong without a legitimate reason, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided to take preventative measures. It has recently ordered the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office and the Flower Management Committee to pay close attention and stipulated that all equipment and materials of the aforementioned factories cannot be exported without prior approval.

### The Export Control Committee Begins Processing the Fifth Quarter's Milk Quota Allocation

[Our Report] The Quota Allocation Department of the Export Control Committee has been ordered to expedite the allocation of the fifth quarter's quota for products in Appendix (II). It is expected to be completed within a week. Quota allocation notices will be issued separately to factories, users, and qualified importers, allowing them to apply to the department according to the quotas they receive. For the fifth and sixth quarters of Appendix (II), the Executive Yuan announced in February of this year a total of US$73,476,000, with half allocated for the fifth quarter, totaling US$36,738,000. Due to foreign exchange difficulties after the announcement, allocation has only been possible now.

### Wool Textile Industry Requests Reversal of Decision Regarding Foreign Currency Deposit Certificates

The Central Bank, Export Control Committee, and China Trust Bureau have agreed on new methods for using special foreign currency deposit certificates purchased with self-provided foreign exchange. The new method still requires the original importer to provide a foreign exchange settlement certificate. After learning about this, the wool textile industry believes that this will increase difficulties for the industry and has expressed its inability to accept the new rules. Yesterday morning (the 4th), representatives Chen Yuanqin, Tang Huaru, Yang Liren, and Ye Yikang were dispatched to the Export Control Committee and the Central Bank to request a reversal of the decision. The industry requested that procedures that have not been completed should be processed according to the new rules. However, for those who have already completed all procedures according to the regulations, they should still be allowed to follow the original rules. The industry pointed out that when the China Trust Bureau purchases their goods, it already adds 150% to the cost, and now the special foreign currency deposit certificates they are entitled to receive require a foreign exchange settlement certificate, which will threaten the survival of the industry. Therefore, they strongly request a reversal of the decision.

### First Day of University Games: University and College Groups - St. John's and National Defense Medical College Lead; Shanghai University and Lixin Accounting School Dominate Women's Groups

[Our Report] The opening ceremony of the third Municipal Joint University and College Games was held at 1:00 PM yesterday at the Jiangwan City Stadium. A total of 18 universities and colleges participated, with more than 400 male and female athletes, marking the largest University Games event yet seen. The opening ceremony was presided over by the chairman, President Cheng Xiaogang of Jiaotong University, who delivered the opening address. Mayor Wu's representative, Canjun Wang Guanqing, delivered an instructional speech. The ceremony was simple and solemn, followed immediately by the start of the competition.

The results of the first day of competition showed that St. John's University led in the men's university group with 29 and a half points, followed by Tongji University with 19 points, Shanghai University with 14 points, and Jiaotong University with 12 points. However, with a gap of more than 10 points, St. John's is considered the strongest contender for the championship. In the women's group, Shanghai University led with 9 points, followed by Daxia University with 8 points, and St. John's, Guanghua, and Jinan Universities each with 6 points. The championship will be a fiercely competitive race. In the men's college group, the National Defense Medical College took the lead with 31 points, followed by Lixin Accounting School with 21 points and Shanghai Law College with 20 points. Today, there will be a heated competition with the National Defense Medical College. In the women's group, Lixin Accounting School scored 31 points, making the championship almost certain. The National Defense Medical College only scored 6 points, and Shanghai Law College scored 3 points. Only East Asia University participated in the physical education group, which was not scored and was only for demonstration purposes.

The results of the first day were mediocre, mainly due to the lack of training in each school. However, St. John's University broke the university record of 48.7 seconds in the men's 400-meter relay with a time of 47.5 seconds, which was particularly impressive. The performance of the physical education group was better than average, but the lack of competition made it somewhat unsatisfactory.

The games will continue at the same venue starting at 2:00 PM today, with awards and closing ceremonies immediately following the competition.

### Tense Moment: St. John's Overtakes Shanghai in 400m Relay

The tensest event yesterday was the men's 400-meter relay in the university group, where all the short-distance elites from various schools gathered. Wang Songtao of Daxia took the lead in the first leg, gaining a significant advantage. In the second leg, Shanghai gradually caught up, with Li Rongbang of St. John's closely following. In the third leg, Shanghai remained in the lead, with St. John's and Daxia running neck and neck. In the final leg, Shanghai continued to lead with the momentum, but Pan Yongyi, a short-distance prodigy from St. John's, chased frantically with amazing speed. He relied on the final sprint to edge out Wang Jingwei of Shanghai by a shoulder, winning first place with a time of 47.5 seconds, breaking the university record of 48.7 seconds held by Shanghai, and marking the biggest achievement of the day.

### Indonesian Chinese Delegation Departs Shanghai Today and Tomorrow to Return South

The Indonesian Chinese delegation participating in the 7th National Games departed Shanghai in batches by plane to Hong Kong yesterday and today. Yesterday, more than 40 male and female athletes departed, and today, more than 20 athletes will depart, led by team leader Qiu Zuorong at 6:30 AM. After gathering in Hong Kong, all athletes will board a mail ship on the 9th to return to Java. According to team leader Qiu before his departure, he expressed his deep gratitude for the praise and guidance given by all sectors of the motherland and the sports journalism community during their participation in the National Games. He also apologized for not being able to say goodbye due to the haste of departure.

### Gansu National Games Athlete Yun Ying to be Buried Today

Yun Ying, an athlete from Gansu Province participating in the National Games, unfortunately passed away in Shanghai last month due to illness. Friends of Yun Ying have scheduled a memorial service before the burial at the Guohua Funeral Home at 1:00 PM this afternoon, and the burial will take place at Anping Cemetery at 3:00 PM this afternoon.

### Snippets from the Venue

The cheers of the cheerleading squads are the only unique phenomenon of this sports meet compared to the 7th National Games. Shanghai University and St. John's University both have cheerleading squads. The former has a larger number of people and is more outstanding, but the cheerleaders are inevitably less impressive due to the underperformance of the athletes.

Most of the sports uniforms have a white background with red characters. Tongji, Shanghai Law, Normal College, Shanghai University, and Daxia are all examples. St. John's and Dental College have red backgrounds with white characters. Jiaotong has blue uniforms with yellow characters, and Jinan is all black, making them the easiest to identify.

Tongji's Mai Mingda and Pan Zhengming, with numbers 1 and 2, suddenly remembered this during the high jump final and couldn't help but smile at each other. In the end, they won first and second place, which can be said to be a coincidence.

Among the athletes of St. John's, there are two blue-eyed individuals, Bao Lai and Peng Sandi. The former is known for basketball and triathlon, while the latter participated in the 1500-meter race without any outstanding performance.

The track and field referee Liu Hesheng was very critical of athletes who false started and very considerate to those who did not.

The sixteen school flags were lined up horizontally, with five different colors. Among them, the St. John's school flag was the smallest, and the Tongde Medical College flag was the most eye-catching.

The opening ceremony yesterday was very simple. President Cheng's speech was short but meaningful. The athletes stood in the hot sun for only a few minutes, which they were very grateful for. This is a good example of an opening ceremony for a sports meet and is worth promoting.

The command platform lacked microphones, and the announcer shouted through a megaphone, straining his voice. The lack of a commanding soul for the conference was a shortcoming. It is said that it was not due to saving money, but rather a lack of electricity.

Having too many groups has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that everyone can score points and everyone is happy. The disadvantage is that it is distracting and cannot be focused. News reporters were dizzy. On the first day, there were as many as 30 finals, which can be described as a grand spectacle.

A sports meet with the participation of 18 universities is not small in scale, but some facilities are lacking. Even the university presidents, who are the president and vice presidents, did not have chairs to sit on and walked around on the command platform. It is said that this is due to insufficient funding.

The general decline in results does not resemble a joint university sports meet. Lack of training is the biggest reason, and the school authorities and sports directors should be held responsible.

Only East Asia University participated in the physical education group, which seemed like an East Asia Physical Education University sports meet inserted into the main event.

Several athletic ladies wore casual clothes and watched from the sidelines without participating in the performances, which was a pity. According to the coach, it was all due to unavoidable family matters.

In front of the western command platform, there were five large and small tents in total, one for St. John's, two for Guanghua, and two for Tongji. There were also six small tents on the north side, which were the base camp for the East Asia Physical Education University Boy Scouts.

The amount of allocation to each province varies, depending on the funds retained by the Ministry. On average, each central national school can receive a set of books. Fourteen kinds of reference books for elementary school teachers, totaling 108 volumes, were selected and combined into a set, costing 11.5 million yuan per set. A total of 3,000 sets were purchased. On average, each county or city can be allocated one or two sets. Forty kinds of reference books for teacher training were selected. The 24 provinces and cities mentioned above have a total of 688 normal schools, and each school will receive one copy.

Literary History

### A Study of "South Liang" as Written on the Surviving Fragments of Shou Wen's Rhyme Book

— Tang Lan

The surviving fragments of Shou Wen's rhyme book unearthed from Dunhuang are inscribed with "Written by the Han Buddhist monk Shou Wen of South Liang." Because Shou Wen's affairs are unverifiable, this inscription is a very important piece of material for researching Shou Wen.

Regarding the three characters "Han Buddhist monk" in this inscription, Mr. Luo Xintian stated in his postscript to the fragments that they were "to distinguish him from the Indian Sramanas" (Collected Papers of the Institute of History and Philology, Series 3, Part 2), which is generally credible. Concerning "South Liang," Mr. Luo said, "It does not indicate a dynasty, but rather a prefecture or city," and further stated, "After the Tang dynasty, only Zhu Wen's state was named Liang, but its initial capital was Kaifeng, and later it moved to Luoyang, neither of which can be prefixed with 'South.' Therefore, South Liang clearly does not refer to a dynasty." Besides a dynasty, it can only be said to be a "prefecture or city," but in the Tang dynasty, there was only South Liang Prefecture during the fourth year of Wude (621 AD), which was separated from Tanzhou and located in present-day Baoqing, Hunan. However, it was changed to Shaozhou during the Zhenguan era and then to Shaoling Commandery during the Tianbao era. This ephemeral prefecture name would not likely have been used by anyone at the end of the Tang dynasty. Therefore, Mr. Luo further suspected that this was the "South Liang" of the Tian Wan family in the Records of the Grand Historian. The "Annotations on the Records of the Grand Historian" quotes the "Geography of the Tai Kang Era of Jin" as saying:

During the Warring States period, Liang was called South Liang to

distinguish it from Greater Liang and Lesser Liang. It is believed that customs persisted, and since the Tang people often called Bianzhou "Greater Liang," perhaps they also called the old Liang County west of Linru "South Liang."

However, the Ming Dynasty Buddhist monk Zhen Kong's "Collection of Rhyme Penetration Pearls" provides a general introduction to the sources, stating:

Yang Xiong created rhymes in the Yewang chapter, Monk Shou Wen transmitted the alphabet. Like the son Guanyin, he established and created, The five sounds of breathing are from Xuanyuan.

The Great Tang monk Shou Wen established this framework, there must be an external source. Later, Chief Monk Shou Wen of Liangshan added six mothers to harmonize the palace and shang tones. He is also called "Chief Monk Shou Wen of Liangshan." Mr. Luo mentioned in a footnote, saying:

Does this so-called Liangshan refer to the mountain where Shou Wen resided? Or does it refer to Liangshan County, which belongs to Wanzhou in the Southern Circuit of Tang? Or is it simply a corruption transmitted from "South Liang"? For a time, I suspected that I could not decide and will await further study.

This doubtful case has been on my mind for eight or nine years. What initially caught my attention was Mr. Zhao Yinzhao, who suspected that "Liangshan" was the name of a mountain, a mountain in Hunan, and not a county. I remember he found a genealogy of many monks from Liangshan, but unfortunately, they were all from the Song and Yuan dynasties, and still, no clues could be found.

Recently, someone told me that Mr. Zhou Yiliang had once said that Liangshan was in Sichuan, which probably refers to Liangshan County of Wanzhou, which belonged to the Shannan East Circuit during the Tang dynasty.

In fact, the "South Liang" written by Shou Wen should be Nanzheng County in present-day Shaanxi. Chapter 190 of the "Extensive Records of the Taiping Era," under the entry for Wen Zao, says:

During the reign of Emperor Xianzong, the Rong and Jie barbarians caused chaos in China,

and teachers from all sides were used to quell the border troubles. An edict was issued to "South Liang" to raise 15,800 armored soldiers and send them to the passes. The general who was about to rise up instigated a rebellion, expelled his superior, and, fearing the court's conquest, gathered together those who refused orders for more than a year. Emperor Xianzong was deeply troubled by this and searched for a general for a long time. Wen Zao, the magistrate of Jingzhao, requested to go, and the emperor asked him about the supplies and expenses of the army. Wen said, "I will go without requesting a single soldier or an inch of weaponry." When he reached the border, the people of "Liang" spied and saw that he was only a scholar. They all congratulated each other, saying, "The court will surely not question their crime, so what else is there to worry about?" Wen only proclaimed the imperial edict to reassure and appease them, and upon arriving, he did not ask about anything. However, the "Liang" generals, burdened with their misdeeds, did not discard their weapons when they went in and out, and Wen also did not distrust them. One day, a musical performance was set up in the polo field, and all the lower ranks of the three armies were allowed to bring their bows and swords. They were then ordered to eat in the long corridor, sitting in two rows north and south of the steps, with two long ropes. Each soldier was ordered to hang his bow and arrows on the rope in front of him while eating. After a while, when the wine came around, with a shout, the two ends of the rope were pulled together, and the swords were three zhang above the ground. The soldiers were in great chaos, unable to use their courage, and then the doors were closed and they were all beheaded, more than five thousand people, and not a single one survived. Among them were many commoners who came to the banquet to accompany their relatives and substitutes, and both the worthy and the unworthy were destroyed together. Since then, the people of "South" have not dared to rebel for generations. I served in that place twenty years ago, and the elders still vividly remember it. – From "Wang's Observations"

This story is recorded in the Tang history. The "Old Book of Tang, Biography of Wen Zao" says:

In the fourth year of Taihe (830 AD), the Xingyuan army rebelled and killed the military commissioner Li Feng. Emperor Wenzong, considering that Zao had a strong sense of justice and hated evil, appointed him as Inspector of the Right Scattered Cavalry Attendants, Magistrate of Xingyuan, and Military Commissioner of the Shannan West Circuit. Zao resigned and went to his post, reporting to the emperor the chaotic state of Xingyuan, and Wenzong fully understood its root causes, allowing him to act at his discretion. The emperor, concerned about the cost of using troops, Zao reported: "I estimate that the troops of all circuits who conquered the barbarians have already returned. I hope that when I arrive in Baoxian, I will be granted a secret edict to restrict and bind them, so that they will arrive one after another along with my troops from Xingyuan. This will be sufficient." He then granted Zao four secret edicts, ordering the Shence Army General Dong Chongzhi, the Hedong General Wen Dehou, the Heyang General Liu Shihe, and others to all receive Zao's orders. Zao traveled to Baocheng, where he met Wei Zhizhong, the Xingyuan General who had returned from conquering the barbarians. Zao immediately retained him for self-defense, secretly conspired with Zhizhong, and also summoned the sub-generals Zhang Pi and Li Shaozhi to verify their intentions. When they set out for the prefectural city, he used 800 men as a guard team and 500 men as the vanguard. The vanguard entered the palace and divided up to guard the gates. Zao got out of the car and set up a tent, and the officials supplied the accounts at the tent. Zao said, "This place is narrow and not enough for the soldiers. Move it to the ya gate." After sitting down, the generals and soldiers lined up, and Zhizhong's soldiers surrounded them. Zao said: "I want to ask the new army about their intentions to stay or go. Let them all come forward, and the old army must not act rashly." After inquiring and greeting them, he ordered them to sit down. Those who had not arrived were ordered to carry wine and patrol around, and when the wine had gone around, those who had not arrived had all arrived, and the yamen soldiers also closed in. The seated soldiers did not realize what was happening. Zao raised his hand to signal them to rise, but Zao shouted at them, and they dared not move. He then summoned the seated soldiers and questioned them about the killing of Feng. Zhizhong and Zhang Pi stood on either side of the steps, drew their swords, and shouted, "Kill!" The surrounding soldiers attacked together, and the rebel leaders, including the training envoy Qiu Chou and more than a thousand officers and soldiers, were all beheaded on the spot, and blood flowed in all directions.

The "Extensive Records" differs from the "Old Book of Tang" in two major points. First, the "Extensive Records" is set during the reign of Emperor Xianzong, while the "Old Book of Tang" is set in the fourth year of Taihe during the reign of Emperor Wenzong. Second, the "Extensive Records" is set in "South Liang," also called "Liang," while the "Old Book of Tang" is set in "Xingyuan."

The "Extensive Records" notes that this story is "From Wang's Observations." This book is now lost. The "Extensive Records" quotes it 29 times, also calling it "Wang's Records," most of which are stories from the Former Shu during the Five Dynasties period, and often mentions Wang Renyu's experiences. It should be the "Wang Renyu's Records" in three volumes in the "Song History, Treatise on Literature." According to the "History of the Five Dynasties, Chapter 57, Biography of Wang Renyu":

When Emperor Zhuangzong of Tang pacified Shu, Renyu was later appointed

as a judge for the Qinzhou military commission. When Wang Sitong was stationed in Xingyuan, he was recruited as an aide. Later, Wang Sitong was defeated by the deposed emperor. "Wang's Observations" also has an entry on Wang Sitong, found in Chapter 459 of the "Extensive Records." According to the "History of the Five Dynasties, Biography of Wang Sitong":

When Shi Jingtang attacked Dong Zhang, Sitong was the commander of the vanguard. His troops entered Jianmen, but the rear army did not follow. Sitong fought Zhang and was defeated and retreated. After Jingtang's troops withdrew, Sitong was transferred to Shannan West Circuit. Soon after, he was again appointed as the Magistrate of Jingzhao and the Western Capital Garrison Commander. It can be seen that Wang Sitong was stationed in Xingyuan and recruited Wang Renyu as an aide, which should have been after the first or second year of Changxing of Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang and before the first year of Yingshun of the Han Emperor (931-934 AD).

The incident of Wen Zao killing the rebel soldiers in Xingyuan occurred much earlier, in the fourth year of Taihe of Emperor Wenzong of Tang (830 AD). Chapter 310 of the "Extensive Records of the Taiping Era, Wang Qi" quotes the "Records of Hedong" and the "Chronicles of Han" as being consistent. By the time Wang Renyu became an aide, more than a hundred years had passed. Stories heard from the elders are very prone to errors in dating. Moreover, Wang himself said, "I served in that place twenty years ago." It can be seen that when he wrote this story, it was already during the Later Zhou period (after 951 AD). According to his biography, he died in the third year of Xiande of the Zhou Dynasty at the age of seventy-seven, so he was probably in his seventies when he wrote the book. Such miscellaneous records, relying entirely on memory and not consulting books, inevitably make the mistake of confusing Wenzong with Xianzong.

However, place names are not easily mistaken. This story happened in Xingyuan. Wang Renyu served as an aide to the military commissioner of the Shannan West Circuit in his fifties, right in Xingyuan, so he said, "I served in that place twenty years ago." He heard the story locally, so he could not have misremembered the place. Now, he replaces Xingyuan with "South Liang," or "Liang," both of which appear, and the only possible explanation is that Xingyuan was also called "South Liang" or "Liang."

Xingyuan had been called Liangzhou since the end of the Wei Kingdom during the Three Kingdoms period. Liangzhou was established in the first year of Wude of the Tang Dynasty, changed to Baozhou in the thirteenth year of Kaiyuan, and then changed back to Liangzhou after only seven years, until Emperor Dezong fled west in 784 AD and changed it to Xingyuan Prefecture. By the time Wang Renyu became an aide, less than 150 years had passed, and it is not problematic that the old name "Liang" was still preserved among the people. This place originally belonged to Former Shu. After the fall of Shu, it became part of Later Tang, so Wang Sitong could be a military commissioner. When Wang Sitong became the Magistrate of Jingzhao and the Western Capital Garrison Commander again, Zhang Qianzhao succeeded him as the military commissioner. In the first year of Yingshun, Wang Sitong fought against the deposed emperor and was defeated. After that, Zhang Qianzhao submitted to Meng Zhixiang. Therefore, when Wang Renyu wrote this story, Xingyuan was actually part of Meng Shu's territory.

Wang Renyu was a native of Qinzhou, a former official of Former Shu, and had lived in Xingyuan, so he was very familiar with the local situation. When casually recording this story, he didn't say Xingyuan or Nanzheng, but wrote "Liang" or "South Liang." This shows that it must have been a very common alternate name at that time. But why add the word "South" to "Liang"? According to my speculation, Xingyuan is in Shannan, and Hancheng, north of the mountains, is the ancient Liang Kingdom, which is said to be the "Liang" and "Qi" mentioned in the Yu Gong's "Governing." And Xingyuan, also called Liangzhou, is said to be the "Liangzhou" in Yu Gong's "Huayang and Heishui are only in Liangzhou." If Hancheng, north of the mountains, is considered "Liang," then Xingyuan, south of the mountains, is naturally "South Liang." Furthermore, looking at it from a closer perspective, near Qianxian, which is the Fengtian County of the Tang Dynasty, is also Liangshan. During Emperor Dezong's time in Fengtian, Gao Chongjie and Zhu Ci's general Li Riyue fought here. It is precisely one south and one north with Xingyuan.

As for Zhen Kong calling Shou Wen "Chief Monk Shou Wen of Liangshan," this is easily explained. Southeast of Nanzheng is Liangzhou Mountain, also called Liangshan. The "Taiping Huanyu Ji" quotes the Erya: "Among the beauties of the south are the rhinoceros and elephants of Liangshan," saying that the prefecture is named after the mountain, which seems to also be called "South Liang." There is also a Zhongliang Mountain in the west. During the Five Dynasties, there was Monk Zungu of Zhongliang Mountain in Xingyuan Prefecture, as seen in Chapter 15 of the "Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp."

Liangzhou Mountain is very large, with more than thirty li of open land in the middle, which is said to be the former county seat. Shou Wen probably resided there. Unfortunately, people at that time only valued discussion and preparation, and the deeds of the place were not investigated at all.

We speculate that he was a person from the late Tang or Five Dynasties period. Now, the place name "South Liang" happens to appear in the records of people from the Five Dynasties period. This limited material is very precious. Wang Renyu (880-956 AD) was famous for his literature during the Five Dynasties period, and he also wrote "Idle Talk of Yutang," which is also lost. It is quoted a lot in the "Extensive Records of the Taiping Era." This book, "Wang's Observations," is a miscellaneous record, many of which are related to historical facts and not fictitious novels. It is a pity that it is buried in the "Extensive Records of the Taiping Era," which is full of gods, monsters, and goblins.
