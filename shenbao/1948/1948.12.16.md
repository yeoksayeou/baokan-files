### Statement by Undersecretary Lovett: U.S. Policy Towards China Unchanged; No Plans to Recall Ambassador to China; McDermott Says Hoffman's Remarks Are Personal Opinions

[Our Newspaper's Report] Washington, 15th - A radio broadcast reported that Undersecretary of State Lovett solemnly declared at a press conference that the U.S. policy towards China remains unchanged. He also stated that Madame Chiang's visit to the United States would not affect U.S. policy towards China. Lovett stated that the U.S. recognizes the Chinese government led by President Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate government, and the U.S. Congress's decision to provide aid to China refers to this government. A reporter then mentioned that he recalled the U.S. announced policy towards China had requested the Chinese government to broaden its base and include the Communist Party. Lovett stated that he did not recall it that way. Lovett stated that rumors about the formation of a coalition government in China were only found in the newspapers and there was no other information. When asked about the proposed amendments to the Chinese constitution, Lovett replied, "I have not heard of it." Lovett stated that to his knowledge, the U.S. government had no plans to recall the U.S. Ambassador to China to discuss the China issue. He also stated that Ambassador Stuart had considered returning home to deliver a speech last month, but he quickly dismissed the idea. Since then, Lovett had not heard anything about a proposal to suggest President Chiang Kai-shek relocate to the United States, and there were no signs of it at the moment. When asked when Madame Chiang would return home, Lovett replied, "I have not heard."

[United States Information Service, Washington, 14th Dispatch] State Department press liaison officer McDermott stated today that when Hoffman discusses future U.S. policy, he often only expresses his "personal opinions." McDermott also stated: "I have a very strong impression that he (Hoffman) is only frankly expressing his opinion on one topic, which is the continued aid to China, especially the continuation of aid to alleviate hunger and suffering."

He said: "The main purpose of the Economic Cooperation Administration is to help people. Journalists raised many hypothetical questions, and Mr. Hoffman expressed his personal opinion on the possibility of providing relief to those in need under various circumstances."

"However, he made it clear that political issues are beyond his official authority, and the final decision in special situations must be made by the White House."

"The State Department is unwilling to discuss hypothetical situations or questions, and will not engage in speculating on hypothetical possibilities. The U.S. government's policy towards China has not changed." McDermott also said: "I have no reason to believe that our people in Nanjing are urging President Chiang Kai-shek to form a coalition government. I believe that this news is fabricated."

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Bengbu, 15th] In the Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield, the fierce fighting on the northern front is adjusting the dullness on the southern front. Under the command of Du Yuming, three army corps launched a southern attack all day. On the 15th, they recaptured the important communist stronghold of Loulou and formed an encirclement around Lilou and Guolou. The communist troops on the north side of the National Army's position showed signs of turning to Qinglongji, and their intention was obviously to strengthen their forces to block the National Army's southward advance. On the southern front, according to the Suppression Headquarters's bulletin, after Li's army corps destroyed the communist positions near the north and south of Baojiaji yesterday, it began attacking the area south of Dagou today. According to reports, the National Army is strengthening its deployments, and the recent silence on the southern front should be the transition period before the storm.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Bengbu, 15th] The Suppression Headquarters announced: Huang Wei's army corps repelled communist offensives several times today in the Shuangduiji and the area east of it. According to reports, Huang's army corps has been fighting hard under siege for the 20th day.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Bengbu, 15th] Our tank units, under the close cover of the air force, cooperated with a certain unit of the National Army to develop mobile tactics, bypass Baojiaji, and attack Yaozhuang (six kilometers north of Baojiaji and five kilometers west of Xinji). After four hours of fierce fighting, all the stubborn bandits were annihilated, and the area was immediately occupied.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 15th] According to reliable sources here receiving military reports from Bengbu: (1) Huang Wei and Li Yannian's two major army corps are accelerating the removal of obstacles to try to get closer, and may achieve a rendezvous on the night of the 15th or the morning of the 16th. (2) Sun Yuanliang's troops have now made contact with the Suppression Headquarters and are coordinating with friendly forces to provide favorable support. The battle situation is stable and showing signs of dawn.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 15th] For more than ten days, the communist troops have been stalemated in the Xiao Yong area and Shuangduiji. In addition, Li Yannian's army corps launched a northern attack, and it seemed that they could no longer hold out. On the 12th, it rained all day, and no planes were dispatched to the front line, which was the time for the communist troops to be active. However, they were silent in the trenches and villages all day, which shows how exhausted they were. Aerial reconnaissance on the 15th discovered trains carrying 2,000 communist troops from Jinan and Yanzhou heading south towards Xuzhou. Seven hundred communist troops southeast of Suining were concentrating on Guzhen. It seemed that the communists were gathering all the remaining forces for a final struggle. The above-mentioned roaming bandits were all bombed by the air force.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 15th] (1) Zhao Zhuang, on the southern edge of Huang Wei's army corps in Shuangduiji, fell on the 14th. On the morning of the 15th, Huang's army corps sent a team to recapture it, but it fell into communist hands again in the afternoon. (2) In order to relieve the siege of Huang's army corps, the air force used good sunny skies on the 13th and 14th to send B-24 aircraft formations to drop bombs like rain on communist-occupied villages within a 20-li wide area to the east, west, and south of Shuangduiji. On the night of the 14th, air transport planes were dispatched to attack communist positions at night with bombs. (3) On the night of the 14th, more than 50 communist vehicles were discovered between Xuzhou and Suxian, fully loaded and heading south.

### Sun Ke Visits the President to Ask About Cabinet Formation Policies and Personnel

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 15th] The new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 15th after recovering from his illness in Shanghai. He immediately visited the President to ask for instructions on the two major issues of cabinet formation policy and personnel, making a final decision. At 12 noon, he hosted a banquet at his official residence for key central figures to discuss matters. Sun's heavyweight cabinet is waiting for its major policies to be finalized before determining the personnel, because most of the key figures invited by Sun want to take on difficult tasks with Sun when there are propositions and policies. It is heard that the possibility of Zhang Qun and Zhang Zhizhong, two key figures invited by Sun in Shanghai, participating is still high. Shao Lizi will decide based on the policies. If it is still the current policy, he will firmly refuse to participate.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 14th] The Sun Cabinet has been slow to form. The supervisors believe that it is necessary to urge it. This morning, more than 40 supervisors stationed in Nanjing held a current affairs forum, in which they decided to ask the Supervisory Yuan to consult the President to expedite the creation of a new cabinet. The forum was presided over by Liu Zhe, Vice President of the Supervisory Yuan.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Bengbu, 15th] The military attaches great importance to the local communist troops in southern Bengbu, not only because of their impact on transportation. According to reports, there are two larger groups of bandits between Pu and Bengbu, one is Sun Chuanjia's unit, south of Fengyang, and the other is the 331st Brigade, near Chuxian. According to intelligence from the Anhui Security Command, Liu Bocheng had previously sent some cadres to the Huaihe Bay area west of Huaiyuan and east of Fengtai to organize ten detachments. The so-called 331st Brigade may be one of these detachments.

All previous deposit cashing measures issued in various regions are invalid. On the morning of the 15th, various banks in Nanjing still accepted deposits and cashed them according to the old methods. After the Executive Yuan's meeting passed the new measures at noon, Minister of Finance Xu Kan immediately telegraphed the Central Bank, instructing the three banks of China, Communications, and Agriculture to temporarily suspend the acceptance and cashing. In the afternoon of the 15th, all banks simultaneously suspended operations. According to the measures for the deposit and cashing of military, police, public, and teaching staff promulgated by the Central Bank on the 13th, the various agencies gathered and requested the Central Bank to handle the procedures. The original implementation started on the 14th. The staff of the various agencies were running around to raise funds for the five taels of gold that they were allowed to deposit and cash, and now it is also invalid. The Central Bank has set the 17th as the start date for handling deposits and cashing in accordance with the new measures passed on the 15th, in order to complete various preparations on the 16th.

Article 11: The Handling Bank shall announce the names of each deposit and cashing account and the amount cashed out by each account in the local newspaper every ten days.

Article 12: These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 15th] After the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference passed the measures for cashing Gold Certificates deposits on the 15th, Minister of Finance Xu Kan issued a statement, stating briefly that the greatest significance of the government's promulgation of these measures this time is to thoroughly implement the deposit and cashing policy, so that its benefits will reach the majority of the people, and so that a few traitors and wealthy people can no longer use the tactics of manipulation and monopoly. In the process of implementing all policies, loopholes are inevitable, and it is important to pay attention to improving and remedying them at any time in order to achieve perfection, especially in financial measures, the circumstances are more complicated, and of course, they need to be improved at any time in order to achieve the true effect of the original policy. I hope that all sectors will continue to provide more guidance. As long as it is helpful to the country's policies and beneficial to the interests of the majority of the people, I will absolutely welcome its adoption.

### Editorial: The North-South Battlefields and Political Rumors

The battles in the Huai River region are currently deadlocked, and fierce fighting has reignited in the Tianjin-Beijing section of North China. Since the launch of the anti-rebellion military campaign, the nation's and the people's destiny have never been more seriously threatened than at this moment. However, looking at the political situation in the central government, the Weng Cabinet has resigned without resigning (nominally resigned but still in charge), and President Sun has accepted without taking office (nominally appointed but has not yet formed a cabinet). This paralysis is occurring in the central government at a time when the war situation is extremely serious. This is truly the strangest thing in history, both ancient and modern, both in China and abroad. Even though the war has been raging for years, with countless lives sacrificed by soldiers and civilians in the fight for freedom, inexplicable political rumors continue to spread daily. A few politicians, mixed with some reporters who pass on hearsay, seem determined to serve as advance guards for the Communist bandits' political offensive, eager to undermine the morale of our troops on the front lines. The U.S. government spokesman has already debunked the "coalition government" rumor yesterday, but our central authorities remain indifferent and turn a deaf ear. This is truly the strangest of strange things!

First, we must remind those who harbor illusions of peaceful dreams: In theory, who doesn't yearn for peace? But peace is not about seeking temporary ease; peace must be linked to freedom. Otherwise, peace is no different from servitude. Only by being able to fight can we defend, and only by being able to defend can we negotiate peace. In the current situation, even if the central government cannot immediately launch an offensive, it must at least be able to fight and defend in order to be qualified to negotiate peace. Otherwise, it is not peace but surrender! But if we are capable of fighting and defending, then why negotiate peace with the Communist bandits? Furthermore, those who are resisting the National Government today are the Chinese Communists, who believe in communism, follow the orders of the Third International, rely on weapons from the Soviet Union, and whose organized troops include international members of the Japanese Communist Party, Korean Communist Party, and Mongolian Communist Party. What they want to control and deprive is the free life of our people, which is closely related to their vital interests. How can a government entrusted by its people negotiate peace with bandits who betray the country and harm the people? Our Northeast troops and Jinan troops previously laid down their arms due to the "coalition government" rumors, misled by a few unscrupulous generals, leading to the current perilous situation. If, at this time, when morale is high in the Xuzhou-Huaihai area, and our troops are building strong defenses and fighting to the death, we allow rumors of peace that shake the foundation of the nation to spread everywhere, it would be tantamount to serving as a vanguard for the Communist bandits' propaganda war. If there are no Qin Huis in the court, then there will be Yue Feis on the battlefield! If peace rumors become prevalent again, the detrimental effects on the front lines may become too terrible to imagine one day. Therefore, if the central government is determined to fight resolutely, it should first debunk unfounded rumors with actions and facts, so that opportunistic bureaucrats and politicians cannot use their tricks.

Second, throughout Chinese history, when using troops in the north, Hebei and Guanzhong have always been equally important, and in the south, the Huai defense has always taken precedence over the Yangtze defense. The current battle on the Huai River has lasted for over a month, with both sides employing all their strength. Let us first discuss the importance of the Bengbu-Suxian campaign. In the past, people have said that whoever controls the Huai River can resist the north, and whoever controls the Huai River can prevent the south from defending itself. Although transportation has changed slightly today, and the navy and air force can further strengthen the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, the strategic importance remains largely the same as in ancient times. During the Eastern Jin Dynasty, when Emperor Yuan crossed the Yangtze River, and until the Chen Dynasty, the Southern Dynasties resisted the northern barbarians for five generations. Yang Xingmi occupied the region and, until the Li family, refused to submit to China for three dynasties, all because they controlled the Huai River region. Without the Huai River, the Wu kingdom was eventually annexed by the Jin Dynasty, and without the Huai River, the Chen Dynasty was eventually annexed by the Sui Dynasty. It is evident that to secure the Yangtze River, one must first secure the Huai River; without the Huai defense, the Yangtze defense is also in danger. Liu Ji once said: "Throughout history, defending the Huai River has been most difficult for Xie Xuan, and even more difficult for Yang Xingmi. Xie Xuan used 8,000 men to face Fu Jian's army of 900,000, and in the battle of Qingkou, Yang Xingmi used 30,000 men to face Zhu Quanzhong's army from eight prefectures. Despite the disparity in numbers, they were able to win because they controlled the Huai River to resist the enemy and did not allow the enemy to enter the Huai River." Today, the battles in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui are deadlocked in the same area as the Battle of Fei River, and it is precisely the decisive battle for the Huai River region. This is why our Supreme Commander has repeatedly deployed troops to reinforce the area. Central officials, frontline soldiers, and the people in the rear should recognize reality and attach great importance to this decisive battle in the southern theater, and mobilize all forces to fight for victory in this decisive battle. The outcome of this decisive battle is of immense importance! Victory does not depend on numerous small victories, but on victory in this decisive battle on the Huai River. But victory can never be achieved by those who lack confidence. The central government must eliminate elements of defeatism in order to achieve final victory.

Third, speaking of the fierce battles in the Tianjin-Beijing area of North China, we should fully trust General Fu Zuoyi, strengthen his forces as soon as possible, support his strategy, and, most importantly, encourage his soldiers to defend this famous city in Hebei. Throughout Chinese history, those who have fought for control of the country in the north have either used Guanzhong or Hebei, with Shanxi and Henan serving as their thoroughfares. Lü Donglai once said: "Those who used Guanzhong to conquer the country succeeded five times and failed three times, while those who used Hebei to conquer the country succeeded once and failed three times." He also said that the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties used Guanzhong, and Emperor Guangwu of the Han dynasty used Hebei. Only Cao Cao and Shi Le took Guanzhong by conquering Hebei, and Fu Jian took Hebei by conquering Guanzhong. All three controlled most of the country but ultimately failed to unify it. These assertions may not fully align with today's situation, but if the Communist bandits want to control the entire country, they must seize Hebei in the north and Guanzhong as well. The order may differ, but seizing both is inevitable sooner or later. Preparations should be made for the Guanzhong battles, but we will not discuss them for now. However, since Henan has already fallen into their hands, and only Taiyuan remains in Shanxi, the current situation in the north requires us to act swiftly and decisively to fight for this battle in the Tianjin-Beijing area, in order to stabilize the overall situation in Hebei. Lin Biao's bandit troops have entered the pass with all their strength, forced by Li Lisan and unable to retreat, resembling a desperate situation, determined to capture the area. However, General Fu is waiting at leisure, and his situation is far superior. If we are united from top to bottom, and civilians and soldiers cooperate, then with General Fu's veteran troops, known for their skillful defense, the heartfelt support of the people of North China, and the implementation of a strategy to shorten the defense lines and take the initiative, we dare to believe that Lin's bandit troops entering the pass will be defeated by this famous general in the suburbs of Tianjin and Beijing.

In conclusion, the current situation has deteriorated to this point due to past political failures, strategic errors, and the corruption of officials. This has left patriotic people in tears. If our central government does not curb the rumors at this time, and the people do not strive to defend themselves, but only seek temporary escape from difficulties and rush to seize benefits, even to the point of refusing to contribute even a single hair to alleviate the crisis, then I fear that the tragic situation of "before the discussion is settled, the Jin soldiers have crossed the river" may follow the footsteps of the Communist bandits' "fifth column"! Then there will be no time for regret.

The north-south decisive battles, which are related to the life and death of the nation, have begun simultaneously, yet the cabinet members who hold the reins of our central government are still sound asleep, dreaming. Nothing could be more absurd!

### Public Expenditure Standards for Leading Officials of Central Agencies Adjusted

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The case of adjusting the public expenditure standards for leading officials at all levels of central agencies was passed at the political affairs meeting on the 15th.

After increasing by a factor of six, the Premier would receive 1,200 yuan, the Vice Premier 960 yuan, the Minister 720 yuan, the Vice Minister 360 yuan, the Director 240 yuan, the Section Chief 120 yuan, and the Recommended Secretary 66 yuan.

### Wartime Military Law to Prevent Rebellious Elements

To be sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process

### U.S. Military Advisory Group Assists Us in Training 60,000 Service Personnel; Reorganizes Our Military Based on the U.S. Military System

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Despite the current tense environment, the U.S. Army Advisory Group is assisting the Chinese government in revitalizing a more efficient military organization, with "substantial and concrete" progress. According to U.S. sources, with the assistance of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, thirty basic service schools have been established in China, with 60,000 officers and technicians receiving training. U.S. advisors are reorganizing the Chinese military based on the U.S. military system as much as possible. Sources familiar with the matter indicate that there has been significant improvement in the care of Chinese soldiers' clothing, nutrition, and equipment. There is a severe lack of transportation equipment in China, especially railways. The Chinese Joint Logistics Command has now learned the U.S. technique of unloading cargo from trains in one and a half hours and unloading cargo from ships in one and a half days. Previously, it took workers three days to completely unload cargo from trains and four days for ships. Another example is the reorganization of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, which was previously extremely inefficient, but has now been reorganized into the American style, with the First Bureau responsible for administration, the Second Bureau for intelligence, the Third Bureau for personnel, and the Fourth Bureau for materials. Before adopting this system, accurate planning, supply, and troop movement were nearly impossible. Now, all Chinese troops have records to act on a cooperative basis. Basic service schools include artillery, infantry, medicine, signals, and ordnance centers. The instructors are all Chinese officers, mixed with four U.S. officers. Two years ago, the U.S. military began training a small number of Chinese officers, who were then transferred to the front lines to train other officers or establish other service schools.

The amended articles stipulate that the areas of implementation are the seven cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Chongqing.

As for automobile transportation businesses with large operations, the maximum number of small automobiles allowed is no more than ten, and the maximum number of large automobiles allowed is no more than twenty. The city governments may also review and increase or decrease the number of automobiles based on transportation needs within the total number of automobiles reserved for each city.

### U.S. House Speaker Martin Announces: Our Control Yuan's Plea for Assistance Telegram; Legislative Yuan's Telegram Also Submitted to Congressional Committee for Consideration

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 14th] The telegram from our Control Yuan to the U.S. Congress, appealing for increased aid to China to overcome the "urgent crisis" caused by communism and to safeguard the democratic way of life, was made public today by House Speaker Martin. The telegram was delivered by our Ambassador to the U.S., Gu Weijun, to Martin and Senate Speaker Vandenberg on the 11th of this month. Martin made no comment when he released the telegram. It is reported that the Legislative Yuan also sent a similar telegram to Martin and Vandenberg in the first week of December. Some observers believe that the telegram was sent directly to Congress, bypassing the White House and the State Department. The telegram stated: "If China is unfortunately overcome, the Far East will be turned red, and Asia and Europe will not be spared, and even the United States will hardly be safe." A spokesperson for our embassy in the United States stated that the Control Yuan's telegram to the U.S. Congress was sent by an elected body of one country to an elected body of another country, and there was no question of bypassing the executive branch of the U.S. government. The embassy also stated that submitting the Control Yuan's telegram to both houses of Congress was merely in response to a special request from the Control Yuan, and therefore this transmittal of the letter was "routine business" with no "special significance." The Control Yuan's telegram also stated that international communism is now using the old tricks of Germany and Japan to attack countries that love peace and democracy, and that China's communist rebellion is not merely a civil war, but an aggression against the democratic way of life and world peace. It also stated that China suffered severe damage in the Anti-Japanese War and is now forced to launch a great crusade against communism. If it must fight alone, it has no confidence in winning. Martin admitted that he had received telegrams from our Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, and said that the two telegrams have been forwarded to the relevant committees of Congress for consideration. So far, the Legislative Yuan's appeal telegram has not been made public.

### U.S. Republican Congressman Calls for Effective Aid to China

Miller Starts Drafting Plan

[United Press, Camden, New Jersey, 14th] Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Judd, said that the United States has injured China, and the best way to remedy it is to aid China immediately, lest it be too late. If China does not receive U.S. aid, it will fall under Soviet control, and in the end we will still have to stop the Soviet Union in China, so why not do it sooner? The current war against communism in China is the key to all world problems. Unless we quickly provide China with supplies, our investment in China will be exhausted, and the Marshall Plan will never be realized.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Miller, said: "The United States should immediately and effectively aid China to prevent Asia from falling to communism. I have already started drafting an aid-to-China plan, preparing to submit it on the opening day of the new Congress next year, which stipulates an immediate aid of one billion dollars to China, sending a large-scale military advisory group to China to guide the government army in combat, and collecting land and sea transportation equipment to transport necessary military supplies. I hope this plan can be passed in time to help President Chiang."

[Central News Agency, New York, 14th] U.S. Republican Congressman Proust discussed the China crisis on the radio today and called on the United States to give effective assistance to President Chiang's government. The policy of the United States should be to do its best to support President Chiang's government, because Chiang is a hope for saving China from the scourge of the communists.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Former Commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, General Eichelberger, will retire from military service at the end of this year. He said that if Japan succumbs to the communists after the withdrawal of troops from the occupied countries, he "will be frightened by the consequences." When asked what his opinion was on the situation in China, Eichelberger replied: "If the National Government fails and China turns red, then the victory in the Pacific in World War II is not a victory."

### U.S. Newspapers Demand Statement on China Policy

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] The New York Times said in an editorial today that the U.S. government should issue a clear and authoritative statement on its China policy. The New York Times said that American taxpayers have the right to know the whole truth, because the current situation in China is important to every American.

[United Press, New York, 15th] Howard News said in a fifteenth editorial that Hoffman's remarks in Shanghai were a serious blow to the Chinese government. "We must condemn Hoffman's pronouncements at this time and place. This policy is contrary to the Truman Doctrine of resisting communist aggression." "The Soviet Union, through the Chinese Communist troops penetrating the Northeast and North China, has isolated our military position in Korea and Japan. The strategic interests of the United States in the Far East have long been greatly threatened. If Washington encourages the establishment of a coalition government in North China, then South China and Southeast Asia may follow suit." "Was the purpose of our participation in the Pacific War to replace the previous Japan with the Soviet Union? We can hardly imagine President Truman continuing his current China policy. If the President insists on this, we believe Congress will stop him."

### Following the Japanese Finance Minister's Gaffe Incident, MacArthur Supports the Yoshida Cabinet; Even if the Diet Dissolves, the Liberal Party Still Prevails in the General Election; New Budget Expected to Pass Late at Night

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] As a result of the meeting of the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives at 11:00 a.m. today, it was decided to continue to review the budget proposed by the government, because Mr. Hodney, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the General Headquarters, told the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Matsuoka, that "the budget amendment proposed by the opposition party (that is, the budget drafted according to the new salary standards set by the Provisional Personnel Committee) cannot be applied due to the government's financial resources." The new salary standard will still be based on a certain amount of 5,328 yen set by the Ministry of Finance of the government, and the implementation date of the new salary will begin on December 1, and no previous salaries will be retroactively compensated. It is generally believed that this instruction from MacArthur's headquarters was the result of discussions between Yoshida and the headquarters yesterday morning. Therefore, it is generally expected that although some parliamentarians have requested the resignation of the Yoshida cabinet after the Izumiyama incident, the headquarters of MacArthur has implied that it supports the Yoshida cabinet in maintaining the remaining situation, so it will definitely not resign en masse. Even if the Diet is dissolved, the Liberal Party will still be in an advantageous election position.

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] The Yoshida Cabinet's Little Teaching Party and other opposition parties continued to argue over the new basic salary for civil servants on the afternoon of the 15th, but the budget is expected to pass late at night, and then the no-confidence vote against the Yoshida government is expected to pass. Yoshida is expected to dissolve the House of Representatives after the budget is passed in the upper house on the 17th. It is generally speculated that the general election of the new House of Representatives will be held in mid-January next year.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Minister Oya made his first statement to reporters after being appointed Minister of Finance on the 14th, saying: "Until the night of the 13th, the budget issue was proceeding very smoothly. Unfortunately, the situation changed due to Izumiyama's gaffe, and the relationship between the government and the opposition party deteriorated. However, it is expected to improve starting today."

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] At a meeting of the Japanese parliament today, several opposition members demanded the immediate resignation of the Yoshida cabinet, on the grounds that Finance Minister Izumiyama's flirtation with female parliamentarians had completely lost the cabinet's decency.

### Indonesia Asks Security Council to Meet Immediately to Discuss Situation Between Netherlands and Indonesia to Prevent Situation from Worsening and to Find Ways to Resume Negotiations

[This newspaper's report] Paris, 15th broadcast: The Republic of Indonesia requested the Security Council to meet immediately to discuss the tense situation between the Indonesian and Dutch troops. The Indonesian representative to the United Nations urged the President of the Security Council to pay attention to the report submitted by the United Nations Mediation Committee on Tuesday. The report stated that the current situation may escalate the war. He requested the Security Council to seek some ways to avoid the deterioration of the situation, and at the same time find ways to restore Indonesian-Dutch negotiations.

[French News Agency, The Hague, 15th] The Dutch cabinet held a very important cabinet meeting on the future of Indonesia. According to well-informed sources, the Dutch cabinet decided to take "police action" against the Republic of Indonesia, but the date of commencement has not yet been determined. The same source strongly claimed that this decision of the Dutch cabinet will not be changed by the statement announced by Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta on the 14th that Indonesia is willing to respect Dutch sovereignty during the transition period. Local well-informed sources believe that Hatta clearly expressed a compromise attitude, but this attitude is not approved by his cabinet colleagues and Indonesian military leaders. They also believe that the infiltration of Indonesian armed forces into West Java gives the Netherlands a reason to take military action at any time. According to the same source, the Netherlands may take action before the establishment of the Indonesian Provisional Federal Government to prevent the non-republican autonomous states in Indonesia from joining the Republic of Indonesia and working side by side with Indonesia against the Netherlands.

[United Press, The Hague, 14th] The Dutch cabinet held an emergency meeting all day today to discuss the new note submitted by Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta. The content of the note has not been announced, but according to reliable sources, Indonesia is willing to recognize Dutch sovereignty over Indonesia during the transition period. The Dutch government originally intended to establish the Indonesian Provisional Federal Government without waiting for the participation of the Republic of Indonesia, but it has now been suspended.

[French News Agency, Washington, 14th] Indonesian Representative to Washington, Dr. Sumitro, said today that the Security Council will soon try to resume negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands to find a peaceful solution. He also said: This hope is based on reliable sources, and this negotiation will be re-launched under the auspices of the Mediation Committee. If the war in Indonesia resumes, the communists will benefit the most. It should be known that the impact of the Indonesian incident will affect the entire Asia.

[French News Agency, The Hague, 14th] The Economic Cooperation Administration's representative in the Netherlands, Height, today denied rumors that the Netherlands had used U.S. funds to purchase weapons and military equipment for the Dutch army in Indonesia.

### Japan and Siam Sign Trade Agreement

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that Japan has signed a trade agreement with Siam, stipulating a trade value of 60 million U.S. dollars, which is the first trade agreement after the war. Japan will export railway vehicles, building materials, porcelain, electrical materials, cotton fabrics, glass, leadware, chemicals, and paper worth 7 million U.S. dollars to Siam.

### South Korea Celebrates Vigorously After Being Recognized by United Nations

In Seoul, 50,000 members of the right-wing youth groups and official organizations held a mass meeting in the Seoul Gymnasium. President Syngman Rhee addressed the masses, followed by parades of army units and youth group members in the streets.

### Former Commander of U.S. Eighth Army, Eichelberger, Advocates Equipping New Japanese Army with 150,000 Troops as International Anti-Communist Force

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Former Commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Eichelberger, pointed out when interviewed by a United Press reporter on the 14th that there is an "extreme importance" in establishing a well-equipped Japanese security force. He said that there are two possible methods: (1) Arm all the existing 125,000 police officers and increase the number to 150,000; (2) Maintain the existing police force as it is and establish a brand new security force with up to 150,000 people.

Eichelberger said that he favored the second method, and said that the force established by the second method would be a national security force responsible for international defense. He said that the maximum number of this force should be limited to 150,000 people, and should only be equipped with small arms. "If they are not well-equipped, they will be useless." Eichelberger also said that when he left Japan, all 125,000 police officers had only 18,000 pistols. When discussing the need for an organized Japanese armed security force, Eichelberger said: "When the communists on the Asian continent march south on a large scale, this move is even more important to Japan." He continued: "When the Allies defeated Japan without the help of the communists--I solemnly declare, without the help of the communists--we eliminated the obstacles to preventing the communists from marching south. The result of eliminating the obstacles is more important than any concessions we made to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference or the Potsdam Conference. When we defeated Japan, we destroyed the balance of power in Asia." Although Eichelberger did not explicitly state what kind of obstacles were eliminated, he clearly meant the Japanese Kwantung Army occupying the Northeast.

[United Press, Seoul, 15th] Twenty-seven members of the South Korean National Assembly attacked the economic cooperation treaty with the United States passed by the Assembly on Monday.

### French New Budget to be Discussed in Congress on Monday

Total Expenditure Close to Two Trillion Francs

[French News Agency, Paris, 14th] The French Parliament will begin discussing the 1949 budget bill starting next week. According to the draft budget, France's expenditure next year will reach 1,865 billion francs, two-thirds of which is the current budget, including the civil affairs budget of 750 billion francs, the national equipment maintenance fee of 150 billion francs, and the military budget of 350 billion francs. This expenditure will be fully offset by tax revenue. The other one-third of the budget, about 611 billion francs, is a special budget, including construction costs of 270 billion francs, and construction costs of the Monnet four-year plan of 310 billion francs.

### US Consul General and Naval Commander Jointly Host Press Conference Yesterday to Announce: Two Companies of Marines Arrive in Shanghai to Land in Emergency to Protect Overseas Chinese

[Report from Our Newspaper] Two companies of US Marines transferred from Qingdao to Shanghai to protect overseas Chinese, together with the supply units, a total of 695 people, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (15th) aboard the US warship "Belknap," which is expected to arrive at 1 PM this afternoon. This was jointly announced by US Consul General Cabot and Shanghai US Naval Commander Rear Admiral Crawford at a press conference yesterday. After the marines arrive in Shanghai, they will remain on the ship and land at any time in response to changes in the situation to protect the lives and property of American overseas Chinese in Shanghai. Ambassador Stuart, Consul General Cabot, and Rear Admiral Crawford will decide when the situation is urgent and the marines need to land to protect overseas Chinese based on the actual situation. The US Consul General solemnly stated that the Marines are here entirely to protect overseas Chinese, have no intention of creating a public concession in Shanghai, and have no intention of internationalizing Shanghai. All actions fully respect China's sovereignty. Maintaining order in an emergency is the responsibility of the Chinese authorities. The Marines have no plans to cooperate with local self-defense business groups.

Those Without Important Tasks Should Leave Shanghai as Soon as Possible

Regarding the policy of evacuating overseas Chinese, Cabot said that his opinion was completely consistent with that of Admiral Badger, that is, those without important tasks should leave on weekdays, and those with important duties who cannot leave Shanghai will not be forced by the consulate. As for whether American overseas Chinese who take refuge on ships should go ashore if the "crisis" situation disappears in the short term, individuals can decide for themselves based on the facts. In addition to this, the Marines who came to Shanghai this time had previously been stationed in Guam. One company is commanded by Captain Blyth, and the other company is commanded by Captain Lewis. The supply unit is commanded by Major Williams, and Colonel Hughes is in charge of the overall situation. According to Rear Admiral Crawford, there are no plans to increase the number of Marines coming to Shanghai at present.

After the US Warship Arrives in Shanghai, It Will Dock at Yangshupu Wharf

Cabot also said that there was no special significance in choosing this week for the Marines to come to Shanghai. The "Belknap" will dock at a US naval site so that the Marines have the opportunity to conduct field exercises and entertainment nearby. Cabot said that the State Department's policy remains unchanged, "The State Department still hopes that non-essential American overseas Chinese can leave first so that those who have to stay here for duty can be properly protected. The plan discussed today is consistent with what Lieutenant General Badger, Commander of the Western Pacific, announced the day before yesterday. The decision of American overseas Chinese to stay or leave is up to them. Of course, we have no right to force them to leave Shanghai or drag them out of the country. We should understand every possibility, but we do not intend to stipulate which overseas Chinese are essential and which are not. This should be decided by them based on the facts."

Rear Admiral Crawford also solemnly stated that the arrival of the Marines in Shanghai is only accidental and does not mean that the situation has deteriorated today.

[Another Report] The US warship Belknap, which arrived in Shanghai today, will dock at Yangshupu Wharf.

### The Council Meeting of the General Labor Union Decided on Many Important Cases; Living Allowance for Draftees Should Be Reduced; Request Improvement of Key Rice Rationing

The Municipal General Labor Union held its first council meeting after the re-election at 3 PM on the 14th. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) The living allowance for draftees. Workers have paid according to the lowest standard in previous years. Now, they have received a notice from the Military Service Association that they need to pay 1.2 dan and 2 dan, etc. It was decided to send council members Shen Shousi and Xi Xiangsheng to the Military Service Association to negotiate. It is hoped that workers can still pay according to the lowest standard. (2) Regarding the key rice rationing for industrial and professional workers this time, about 10,000 workers cannot get household rice coupons because their household registration has not been reported, and they cannot buy their key rice rationing. It was decided: to ask the Social Affairs Bureau to urgently seek remedial measures. If the key rice rationing for next month is still not improved, the workers are willing to voluntarily give up the rice rationing. It is also hoped that the authorities will handle the distribution of oil and briquettes for November as soon as possible. (3) Recently, the situation has been turbulent, and many factories have used the excuse of suspending business or relocating factories. Industrial unions in the Western medicine, machinery, cigarette, and wool spinning industries have requested assistance. It was decided to send council members Shi Wenbin, Yao Ligen, Wu Guoying, and Huang Yuezhen to the municipal government to petition, demanding the establishment of a specialized agency to handle the suspension and relocation of factories. (4) The association agrees in principle to the year-end bonus distribution method passed by the municipal government. Industrial workers should receive the same treatment as office workers for the year-end bonus. Professional workers can negotiate on their own according to past practice. Barbers should charge double fees at the end of the year, and the doubled part should belong to the employees. The tricycle business should be exempted from rent for a certain number of days as the year-end bonus for tricycle drivers. (5) The Central Bank is exchanging gold and silver, but workers are unable to queue up due to production reasons. They requested the Central Bank to allocate gold to them. It was decided to hand over the matter to the Standing Council to formulate a method and request it from the authorities.

### Accelerate the Handling of Traitorous Property Housing; Original Resident Traitor Families May Be Allowed to Purchase with Priority

Regarding the property and houses of traitors, after the court confirms the confiscation, in addition to the living expenses that the traitor's family can receive at its discretion, the houses they live in must also be confiscated and returned. Currently, many traitor's families are finding it difficult to find housing and earnestly request the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office to change the handling method. The Enemy Property Office drafted a method and requested instructions from the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has now replied: "The houses lived in by the families of traitors are also of a custodial nature. After the confiscation is confirmed, they should naturally be returned to the state. Now, in order to speed up the handling, the original resident traitor families may be allowed to purchase with priority." The office has now issued a notice to all its branches to handle the matter according to this instruction.

National Bank Discount and Loan Committee Decides on Future Agricultural Loan Policy

Adopting a Key Points Approach with All Calculations Based on Actual Goods

[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Discount and Loan Committee recently held its 18th meeting, approving 11 cases related to agricultural and mining companies, transportation, etc., and made decisions on future agricultural loan policies. The main points are as follows:

(1) In order to effectively increase production, meet the needs of farmers, and ensure that loans benefit farmers, future agricultural loans should adopt a key points approach, limited to important areas and areas where handling banks can effectively control and strictly supervise.

(2) Future agricultural loans should primarily be issued in kind. Whether for direct lending in kind or converting to cash, the principle should be to recover in kind. Allocation, repayment of principal, and interest payments should all be calculated based on actual goods.

(3) The interest rate for agricultural loans in kind is set at 0.8% per month.

Large Arrivals, Slow Sales: Rice Continues Downstream, Flour and Oil Prices Fall Across the Board

The rice market is weak and declining due to large arrivals and slow sales, making it difficult to stabilize prices. Initially, sellers were asking for the original price, but buying interest was weak. More samples were being offered in the central market, leading to lower prices. In the southern market, Japonica rice fell by 10 yuan, trading at 355 yuan, while thin Indica rice weakened slightly by 5 yuan. High-quality early-season rice opened at 340 yuan, down 10 yuan, while Indica glutinous rice was relatively stable. In the northern market, Japonica and thin Indica rice each fell by 5 yuan, while early-season rice remained unchanged, but sales were very slow, making the market very weak. Yesterday, the two markets received a total of 10,593 piculs of goods.

Flour:

Continued to decline. The market opened with declining prices in related industries and soft sentiment, with everyone anticipating a decrease. Many retail investors were still selling, while warehouses showed little interest. Old brand flour opened and closed at 140 yuan, a decrease of 13 yuan compared to yesterday. Military ship flour traded at 137 yuan at closing, also down 13 yuan. Red Bee fell by 10 yuan, Jiancheng fell by 7 yuan, and miscellaneous brands fell by 12-13 yuan each. Wheat bran also fell by 4 yuan.

Grains:

Prices fell across the board. With declining rice prices, market sentiment was dampened, and buyers temporarily closed their doors. Sales were slow. Soybeans slightly declined by 5 yuan. Although corn from the northern region was moving, buyers were very demanding, and prices fell by 10 yuan. Red sorghum was being offered more than purchased, with few transactions, and prices fell by 10 yuan. Sesame seeds slightly declined by 10 yuan, and raw peanuts also fell by 30-40 yuan.

Edible Oil:

Prices turned sharply downward. The market opened relatively stable, but rumors strengthened selling pressure midway, and prices in related industries were weak. Sellers were dumping inventory. Although factories were not selling, large amounts of repossessed goods were being released. Soybean oil retreated to 1,000 yuan, closing at 950 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 850 yuan, each down 100 yuan. Raw oil fell sharply by 150 yuan, and small-batch sesame oil fell significantly by 180 yuan. Soybean cake fell slightly by 3-4 yuan.

Totaling US$7.3 Million

[Our Newspaper] The amount of foreign exchange settlement applied for export goods from Shanghai last week (December 5th to 11th) increased significantly compared to the past, totaling over US$7.3 million, breaking the record for weekly settlement amounts.

Uniform Visa for Barter Trade: Rotating Management Committee Formulates Measures

Barter Debt Repayment to the Soviet Union to be Completed by the End of the Month

Our country's barter trade with the Soviet Union, France, Japan, Italy, the United States, etc., is actively underway. However, due to the different currency systems and varying prices in the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Japan, Italy, etc., the visa procedures for imported goods need to be handled separately. The Export Management Committee believes that there are many cases of import through this barter trade. If handled separately, the procedures would be too cumbersome and would waste manpower and resources. Now, to save and simplify, a uniform visa method for foreign barter trade has been formulated. All barter materials from various countries, when imported, will be uniformly visaed according to this method, without separate handling.

It is also reported that although our country has completed transactions in barter trade with various countries, imports have been temporarily delayed due to the current situation. However, the barter debt repayment to the Soviet Union is still continuing. Because it is entirely in the nature of debt repayment, this barter debt repayment can be completed before the end of this month.

Furthermore, in order to adapt to actual needs, the Export Management Committee has decided to "simplify its organization" and establish a Shanghai office to specifically oversee Shanghai's import and export trade matters. The Export Management Committee will only be responsible for the design and supervision of the four major offices nationwide. Once the Shanghai office is established, the Export Management Committee can operate freely. Currently, Shanghai's business is concurrently handled by the Export Management Committee, so the organization is quite large. The relevant measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, and the office will be established as soon as it is approved.

Industrial Loans to be Reviewed Today: The Scope of Purchase of Daily Necessities May Be Relaxed

Mr. Lin Chongyong, Chief Secretary of the Central Bank's Discount and Loan Committee, told reporters yesterday morning that since the National Bank decided to resume its discount and loan policy, applications from various factories have been very enthusiastic. To date, there have been about 30 applications requesting the purchase of finished products, including cotton textiles, leather, new drugs, and machinery industries, with the machinery industry being the most numerous. The Emergency Industrial Loan Review Committee of the Discount and Loan Committee has decided to begin reviewing them today. As for cases of re-pledging, because they need to be handled through banks, the committee has not yet received any applications. However, it is expected that a large number of applications will arrive within a day or two. Mr. Lin stated that the National Bank's decision to resume discount and loan is due to the approaching end of the year, when factories need a large amount of capital to cover workers' year-end bonuses and other expenses. The committee is also closely monitoring the potential impact of loan releases on the market's monetary situation. The quantity of applications from each factory will be based on the factory's actual situation and the impact on the market as the final criteria. Regarding the scope of finished product purchases, the National Bank has also decided in principle that products that are daily necessities can be relaxed in order to coordinate with price controls and facilitate currency management.

Decline in Import and Export Trade: Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Certificates

The official exchange rate for overseas remittances rose by another 2 yuan yesterday, to 52 yuan. The market price for foreign exchange transfer certificates initially traded at 50.5 yuan, then rose to 53 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan from the previous day. According to import and export traders, import and export trade has been very sluggish recently. There are fewer foreign exchange funds available for sale from exporters, and the needs of importers have also decreased significantly. The number of transactions each day is not large, and small transactions are prone to fluctuations. It is easy to rise, but also easy to fall back. It is predicted that if the situation stabilizes slightly, import and export trade can be greatly boosted. At that time, the trading of foreign exchange transfer certificates will return to normal, and overseas remittance income can also increase sharply.

Tea Market Bullish Sentiment Intensifies

[Our Newspaper] This reporter recently met with a prominent tea merchant, who reported that since the authorities restored export loans and foreign exchange transfer certificates, which are beneficial for exports, buying sentiment among exporters such as Taishi, Xiehe, and Yihuo has become even stronger and uncontrollable. However, sellers are becoming increasingly reluctant to sell, resulting in very few transactions and a further expansion of price increases. As for domestic floral teas, the market in this area is also active due to loose credit and added speculative investment, with prices initially rising sharply in the morning before gradually leveling off as sellers took profits, but still ultimately ending higher than before.

Sugar Market Declines

The sugar market was consistently weak yesterday. Sellers in the northern region were actively dumping inventory, while buyers in this area were unenthusiastic and sentiment was soft. Asking prices fell across the board. No. 4 and 5 refined white sugar initially traded at 445 yuan, gradually decreasing in each subsequent transaction, closing at 430 yuan, a decrease of 20 yuan. Medium and coarse sugar each fell by 25 yuan, and other white clay sugar from this factory also fell by 10-15 yuan.

Bank Bureau Revises Domestic Exchange Rate

The domestic exchange rate for the Four Banks and Two Bureaus and One Treasury will be revised from the 16th as follows: Guangdong Province: Guangzhou 100 yuan, Shantou and Haikou 150 yuan each, Zhanjiang 200 yuan; Guangxi Province: Ganzhou, Guilin, Shuzhou, and Nanning 100 yuan each; Hunan Province: Changsha, Hengyang, and Yuanling 70 yuan each; Hubei Province: Hankou 50 yuan; Sichuan Province: Chengdu 150 yuan, Wanxian and Zigong 200 yuan each; Guizhou Province: Guiyang 150 yuan; Yunnan Province: Kunming 150 yuan; Hebei Province: Tianjin and Beijing 50 yuan each; other regions remain unchanged.

Tung Oil Buying Sentiment Prevalent

In the tung oil market yesterday, white oil, which meets standards for export, was in high demand as exporters rushed to meet shipping deadlines, creating a lively atmosphere. Prices also reached their peak, reaching as high as 820 yuan per dan. While transactions for Hongjiang tung oil remained quiet, the trend was still upward.

Silk Prices Plummet

Rumors circulated incessantly in the silk market yesterday. Negative news prevailed, and sentiment was consistently weak, causing the market to decline.

No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 13,000 yuan in the morning, a sharp decrease of 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day's market price. Retail investors were selling actively, while buyers absorbed the supply, causing the market to soften and then rise. Finally, silk weavers sought to buy at lower prices, improving sentiment and causing asking prices to rebound to 13,500 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, prices in related industries fell across the board, increasing selling pressure while buyers were waiting and watching. Asking prices continued to fall by 500 yuan. Dongyang, Jin San, and Ma brands all declined.

Raw Silk: The market continued to weaken in the morning. Except for a few purchases from warehouses, transactions were very scarce. Silk weavers in this area were also unenthusiastic to buy due to the softening of yarn and the stagnation of silk sales, causing market prices to continue to fall. D-grade 78 evenness fell by 1,000 yuan to 15,500 yuan, and premium retail also fell by 1,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan.

Silk Fabric: The market opened lower yesterday, gradually declining downstream. Sentiment was soft, and the market continued to decline. Meiya opened at 10,000 yuan in the morning. Selling pressure was strong after the opening, and the trend was weak, falling all the way to 9,500 yuan at closing. Huaqiang closed at 9,200 yuan, each falling by more than 1,000 yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment outside the market became even weaker, and holders were eager to sell, creating a chaotic market with asking prices continuing to fall by 500-600 yuan.

Spot Cotton Weak:

The spot cotton market tended to be slightly weak yesterday morning. In the afternoon, sentiment was unsustainable. However, due to scarce purchases, transactions were not active. Jingyang flower, Hankou fine velvet, and Huoji brands opened at three levels, with 250 bales traded. Zhoupu seed cotton traded at 270-285 yuan.

Strong Selling Atmosphere: Cotton Yarn Stops Rising and Falls, Cotton Cloth Suddenly Rebounds, Transactions Sluggish

The yarn market stopped rising and fell. There was a strong selling atmosphere in the market, and holders were unwilling to defend their positions, selling actively, causing the market to turn sharply downward.

42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened 2,500 yuan higher than before, at 15,000 yuan. Later, as replacers purchased actively, the price rebounded to 16,200 yuan at closing, resulting in a decrease of 1,300 yuan compared to the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix also fell by 1,300 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 13,500 yuan, once reaching as high as 14,600 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot opened at 14,000 yuan, and although it initially rose to 14,600 yuan, it was unsustainable at closing, retreating to 12,900 yuan, a decrease of 1,700 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was at 11,600 yuan, ultimately falling by 700 yuan. 16-count Guangming and 10-count Boy Scout each closed at 8,500 yuan.

Cotton Cloth Suddenly Rebounds: The market opened lower for each type of cotton cloth, and although sellers tried to raise prices, actual sales were weak, and the trend was lifeless, ultimately becoming sluggish.

Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened at 475 yuan, and once rose to 490 yuan midway, but ultimately closed close to the opening price, at 480 yuan, resulting in a severe drop of 60 yuan compared to before. Medium-grade fine cloth such as Five Blessings and Trumpet Boy were both at 430 yuan, each falling by 4-5 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji opened at 505 yuan, then retreated to 480 yuan. At closing, there was a slight rebound, with the market price returning to 490 yuan, a decrease of 55 yuan.

Other cloth also tended to decline.

China Textile Sells Yarn:

Rumors were rampant, and sentiment was low, causing reluctance to buy yarn and cloth, with very few sales. Yesterday, China Textile offered six types of yarn, but only 27 pieces were sold, totaling 393,000 yuan in gold standard currency.

6th District Textile Union Discusses Cotton Allocation Issues

Ratio of Yarn to Cotton Does Not Match Cost, Plans to Request Increase

The 6th District Textile Union held a business director and supervisor meeting the day before yesterday to discuss how to handle the cotton already purchased in the first phase of participation in the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Association, as well as the ratio of yarn to be paid for the second batch of U.S. aid cotton. The following resolutions were reached:

(1) The cotton already purchased by the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Association, allocated to private yarn factories, is estimated to be over 4,000 dan. The amount of cotton individually allocated is very small. It was decided to sell it to the Joint Purchasing Association at market price and return the discounted amount.

(2) The original ratio of U.S. aid cotton does not cover costs, and it is proposed to request an increase. It was decided to send Standing Director Wang Zijian and others to request this from the Economic Cooperation Sub-Bureau and the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee.

A spokesperson for the Union claimed that the previous ratio for calculating U.S. aid cotton was set during the price control period, so the ratio was very low. Now, due to increased labor and service fees and consolidated taxes, the original ratio can no longer maintain costs, hence this request.

Commercial Briefs:

The foreign price of foreign pine is 1.5 cents per foot. If calculated at an exchange rate of 50 yuan per foreign exchange transfer certificate, each foot would be equivalent to 7.5 yuan in gold standard currency. Adding customs duties, each foot would cost at least around 10 yuan. However, the current market price is only 4.5-5 yuan, which is only half of the cost.

The market price of tin foil is stable, with supply and demand in balance. Liuyang Niukou war cannons are being gradually restocked for sale in this area, and the market is showing strength. Exports of Quick Bow were slightly more active than last week, and market prices are also firm.

Sentiment in the pig iron market is trending upwards, with asking prices generally rising. Australian iron is at 2,500 yuan, and Taiwanese and Hong Kong iron is at 1,600-1,700 yuan. However, due to factory closures and rumors of relocation to the south, actual sales remain weak. The allocation price of pig iron from the Resources Committee remains at 2,400 yuan per ton, but few are applying for allocation.

The market for medicinal materials is showing mixed trends, with some prices rising and others falling, but trading in the market remains sluggish. The asking price for Haimen Luopi is 32 yuan, but there are few buyers.

Sentiment for bricks and tiles has turned firm, with prices for bricks and tiles of all sizes rising by 400-500 yuan. Cement is opening at 55 yuan and is gaining momentum. This is because Ma brand cement produced in Tanggu, Tianjin, is no longer being delivered, and Taishan cement produced in Longtan, Nanjing, lacks transportation.

The Black Shops on Shenyu Road

Our Reporter: Jin Tao

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th (Airmail)] The Northeast has changed color. Vehicles and pedestrians are now traveling on the left side of the road instead of the right. Everything else has also been reorganized, implementing a different set of rules. Due to various circumstances, most military and civil servants cannot survive in that environment, and have no choice but to embark on the path they have chosen.

From Changchun to Pan Yang, from Shenyang to Jinzhou, from Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan, and from Shanhaiguan to west of the Luan River, there are large numbers of people traveling this road. This torrent is flowing, especially on the section from Shenyang to within the Pass. Among them are ordinary civil servants and teachers, wounded soldiers, "liberated" soldiers, and special figures in politics and the military. Some are disguised, some are in their original form, a colorful spectacle.

A Meal That Scares People

The villagers along the highway from Pan Yang to Shanhaiguan have found an opportunity to make money. Flatbread, millet porridge, large pancakes, boiled sweet potatoes, and sorghum rice have all become precious commodities. Dust and filth are no longer important to people. Not washing hands and faces for several days is not considered strange, because everyone is tolerating dirt and grime. I remember being scolded for rinsing my mouth and wiping my face in Hongluoxian, 30 kilometers west of Jinxi.

The small shops and kitchens along the highway, which were closed or suspended when trains were running smoothly, have now reopened and increased in number. A red circle is hung in front of the door, adorned with a piece of bright red cloth, which is the best lodging for these western migrants. Sleeping on a dirt kang for a night, or lying on a pile of straw on the ground, requires paying a high price. According to the bandit regime's exchange rate of 10 yuan gold standard currency to 1,000 yuan bandit money, that would be 100 yuan gold standard currency. Eating a meal of sorghum rice and white tofu soup would cost an additional meal fee equivalent to about 150 yuan gold standard currency.

Ten or twenty people sleep on one kang, crowding and pushing each other, but no one cares, because those who come later have to sleep on the pile of straw on the ground. This is several levels lower than the small shops "where you can see the sky at cockcrow." Everyone calls these dim, filthy, and deceiving places "black shops."

Risky River Crossing Carts

The Da Ling River is flowing with ice. The huge iron bridge is broken and cannot be reconnected, lying askew. Although the water is not very deep, it is quite turbulent. Carts and military and civilian pedestrians waiting to cross the river fill the east bank of the river. "Water bandits" wearing backward-facing fur pants are standing in the river testing the water. Passengers sit on top of the carts, and must run across the river in one go. People shout, horses neigh, ice blocks collide. The carters shout "Wo!", "Yu!", "Jue!", lashing the horses with whips. In this tense scene, many people overturn and fall into the water. Some drown, and some lose their belongings. Many "liberated" soldiers sell military supplies along the way in exchange for food and spending money, traveling at night and enduring hardship. Because they are suffering the consequences of the evil deeds of bad people in the past, they are subject to much discrimination and hear many harsh words. On the east bank of the Da Ling River, they insist on taking the "river crossing cart" to cross the river. The "river crossing cart" is a business of risk, and can only carry four people at a time. These soldiers are not paying, and the river crossing cart waits until it has enough passengers before crossing the river. Adding one more person would be dangerous. The carter shouts and curses, pushing them down. The soldiers glare, and the other side does not show weakness. Some people say that the carter is beating "a dog that has fallen into the water." There are many "river crossing carts" in the river. Due to being overloaded or being hit by ice blocks, they overturn, injuring people and killing horses. The scene is tragic.

Fierce District Yazi

There are countless bandit military checkpoints along the way in Heishan, Beizhen, and the Da Ling River. Each village and town has three or four or more. They check, interrogate, and demand travel permits. Some can read, some look at the red stamps, and some take pedestrians and carts to their platoon or company headquarters and hand them over to their political workers for questioning, delay, and detention.

Some staff members of the bandit "district government" deliberately make things difficult for pedestrians, cheating and extorting, which is unbearable and infuriating. Everyone calls these people "district yazi." Seeing pedestrians' watches and fountain pens, they offer ridiculous prices to buy them. In order to reduce trouble, pedestrians are happy to agree. At night in secluded places, they also confiscate people's gold jewelry and property.

Heishan and Beizhen are "old liberated areas." The bandit's local administrative organization is deeply rooted. They are particularly strict and ruthless in checking, interrogating, or detaining people. Everyone has a mutually cautionary saying: "In Heishan, even a goose loses a feather," and "In Beizhen, it is difficult to fly away even with wings." I don't know how many people have suffered there, and how many people have suffered because they were considered "not honest." The reporter suffered greatly in Beizhen.

Calling You "Stop A While"

The bandit "farmers' associations" in the townships around Suizhong have also been organized. In many villages, farmers use manure shovels to pick up cow and horse manure while asking pedestrians for travel permits. Some small stalls selling millet porridge and large pancakes do business and ask you to stop for questioning at the same time. If you drink a bowl of his millet porridge and eat a piece of pancake, he will show a very welcoming attitude. Some are planning to buy one or two items of clothing from the passers-by, so they call you to stop a while or stand a while so they can take the opportunity to get some cheap items. According to their saying, it is "for the public" and "production," without interfering with each other. In some places, "children's corps" are holding red-tasseled spears and asking for travel permits. Pedestrians who meet them should call "Little Brother" a few more times, and those who meet older farmers' association members should call "Grandpa" a few more times, which will lead to benefits and advantages.

In order to hurry on the road and reduce trouble, many people get up after midnight. Although the night is dark, the starry sky indicates the direction and also tells the pedestrians the time. Wild temples, deserted villages, mountains, and gullies have all been imprinted with the footprints of these people. Traveling again and again, in this 20th-century era, they are re-experiencing the life and suffering of the 18th century.

Su Bei Peng Zhutian Killed in Jiangnan Road

Refugees, Please Look at This Mirror

[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 13th] Peng Zhutian from Donghe, originally the village head, fled last year due to the tense situation and lived in Wanshiqiao, Yixing for a long time. This spring, he moved to Lijiaqiao Town in Qianhuang District of this county and opened the Gongshenghe oil, rice, and grain store with a friend. Business was not bad. Recently, fellow villagers from Wanshiqiao bought more than 20 mu of land, and Peng was invited to write the contract as a fellow villager. On the 13th, after Peng finished his work, he took a bus to Yuncun around 11:00 AM and was walking back to Li Town when he was suddenly attacked by three plainclothes bandits near Lukeng Village, who hacked him with knives and axes for six or seven blows to the head. Peng was caught off guard and fell to the ground in a pool of blood. A passing monk glimpsed the scene and rushed to report it to the local village office. The murderers had already fled. After identification, they immediately reported it to the Lijiaqiao grain store to arrange the funeral and reported it to the county to arrest the murderers. General speculation is that it was either a revenge killing or an assassination by bandits, but there are no clues as to the cause. The difficulty of being a refugee can be seen from this.

Relief for the War Zone on the Jinpu Line

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 12th] This time, the residents of villages and towns such as Huoxingmiao, Maojiagou, Chizhuang, Suji, and Zhujiagang Shiqiao in the northern countryside of Huaiyuan on the Jinpu Line suffered miserably from the devastation by bandit troops and the destruction of artillery fire. They were displaced and extremely pitiful. Peng Liren and Song Zixin, the steady-profit relief workers sent by the Ministry of Social Affairs to Bengbu, have been personally taking money to the disaster-stricken villages and distributing accounts for days, 40 yuan per person in the severely affected areas and 20 yuan per person in the slightly affected areas. It is learned that Peng and others will continue to Qianzhan to provide practical relief.

Suzhou Meiqi Theater Suffers Losses, Demands Compensation from Soochow University

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 15th (Wire)] The Theatre Industry Association convened an emergency meeting today and resolved to demand compensation from Soochow University for the losses suffered by Meiqi. At the same time, it sent representatives to the City Defense Department to petition for a guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future. The department then sent personnel with the person in charge of the association to Soochow University to negotiate, but the university denied that the students had destroyed it and said that they should not further provoke student emotions and that they could compromise and resolve the matter peacefully. In the end, the university agreed to assist in the investigation of the lost projection lens of the theater so that it could resume business as soon as possible.

Gaolan Promotes the Spirit of Wu Xun: Lanzhou Rewards Model Households, Yongjing Old Man Talks About Health

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 10th (Airmail)] The Yuanhechuan River Basin in Gaolan Dong Township is densely populated and has a beautiful environment. There are more than 600 school-age children, but there is still no central national primary school to date. The county promoted the movement to abolish temples and build schools last year. Zhao Dingjiu and other gentry who are enthusiastic about education raised 500 shi of wheat. After a year of preparation, Changshou Temple, which was dilapidated, has been renovated into a new-style Mulberry Garden Central Elementary School. The school held a completion ceremony on the 5th of this month, and a student achievement exhibition was held at the same time. Song Ke, Director of the Construction Department of Gansu Province, Hao Derun, Magistrate of Gaolan County, and more than 20 local gentry came from more than 40 li away to participate.

This day was the 110th birthday of Mr. Wu Xun. The school chose this day to commemorate it, with a deep meaning. A couplet was hung at the venue: "Proud of wealth and sincere but foolish, do you not see where Shi Chong's wealth and honor are now? Begging for school is a difficult task, please look at

### Free Boat Rides Arranged for Jiangya Victims' Families

The free boat ride certificates issued by the Relief Group of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association's Jiangya Wheel Tragedy Aftermath Committee caused disturbances because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had not reserved seats. After negotiations, Li Qingzhang, the head of the company's ticket office, agreed to do everything possible to resolve the matter. Additionally, the Dinghai Zhujianshan Township Office recently telegraphed the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, stating that the body of a Ye surname had been recovered by fishermen in that area and requested that the family come to collect it. The Relief Group located the family, Ye Hanxinglin, and issued a relief fund of 1,500 yuan and a free boat ride certificate for them to collect the body.

### Female Corpse Discovered in Nanhui Nicheng Township

Yesterday, the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association's Jiangya Tragedy Aftermath Committee received reports from Gu Zihao of the Dahui News Agency in Nanhui County, Pudong, and Ying Youchun, Sun Jinfu, and Zhu Ada, residing at No. 58 Dong Fahua Town in the city, stating that a female corpse from the Jiangya Wheel had floated to the second Bao area of Nicheng Township in Nanhui County and has now been buried. According to villagers who came to Shanghai, the female corpse wore a red cotton undershirt, a black cheongsam, high-top velvet cotton shoes, and had permed hair.

### General Manager and Eight Others of Tongyi Trust Company Sued

[Our Newspaper] Chen Zhigao, general manager, and eight others of Shanghai Tongyi Trust Company were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for violating the Banking Law yesterday. Chen, along with company executives Cheng Zhongfan (Assistant Manager), Ying Hejun (Deputy General Manager and Head of Banking Department), Feng Yunliang (Deputy General Manager and Head of Trust Department), Chen Gengyu (Head of General Affairs), Cheng Kefan (Deputy Head of General Affairs), Chen Zhihe (Assistant Manager and Head of Securities Department), Yin Qiyan (Assistant Manager and Head of Accounting), and Liu Huidong (Assistant Manager and Head of Cashier) were responsible for company operations. In 1947, they jointly used the company's organization to continuously violate the Ministry of Finance's Management of Banking Regulations and the Banking Law, directly engaging in commerce, hoarding goods and paper, trading gold, seeking illegal profits, and sharing them. To evade inspection by the supervisory authorities, they created secret accounts and deliberately made false records in various relevant accounts. In August of this year, they were anonymously reported, and the Financial Control Bureau investigated and found the accounts to be false, transferring the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.

### Rice Industry Representatives Explain the Mystery of Rice-for-Cloth Exchange: Cloth Stored in China Textile Corporation Warehouse, Delay in Withdrawal Has Reasons

After the rice industry's rice-for-cloth exchange case was revealed, all parties paid close attention, especially the fact that the cloth was still stored in the warehouse, leading to questions about how the rice was exchanged. According to a person in charge of the Rice Business Association, in order to suppress rice prices, the authorities decided to implement the rice-for-cloth exchange method. At the beginning of the implementation, Supervisor Jiang convened a meeting of rice industry representatives at the Central Bank on October 4. Mayor Wu and Yang Chuo'an, chairman of the Food Department's Emergency Storage and Purchase Committee, were also present. They instructed to find ways to purchase rice from rice-producing areas and transport it to Shanghai, supplying it at the limited price of 22 yuan per dan. However, the price of rice in various places had risen to more than 30 yuan per dan, and the loss would be compensated by the authorities by allocating 20,000 bolts of cloth at the limited price, which could be transported to other ports for sale. By October 23, the association had barely raised 560,000 yuan, paid for the cloth, and sold more than 30,600 shi of rice. The 20,000 bolts of cloth remained stored in the China Textile Corporation warehouse and were never withdrawn. Because of the precedent of the grain loan case, the rice shops first reported the accounts for purchasing and selling rice. After three accountants carefully audited and confirmed the accuracy, they planned to withdraw and allocate the cloth according to the prescribed ratio. Therefore, the cloth has not been touched at all.
