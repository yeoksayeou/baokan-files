### Active Air ForceÂ·Powerful Tanks: National Army Continues Advance on the Bengbu-Suxian Southern Front; Li-Huang Corps' Distance Extremely Limited

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Zhazhaopu, 13th] Today's battle of Zhaxian-Suxian continues to focus on the positions of the Huang Wei Corps, with fierce fighting occurring as both sides contest every inch of ground. The National Army's Li Corps has made continuous progress in recent days. To avoid the misfortune of being encircled and annihilated after the Huang and Li Corps join forces, the communist bandits, in addition to putting up a stubborn and desperate resistance against the advancing Li Corps in the north, have also launched an all-out assault on the positions of the Huang Corps. The Huang Corps, fighting a bloody battle in isolation, yesterday again routed a regiment of their 6th Column south of Biandui Settlement, and their positions remain unmoved. On the Li Corps side, under the cover of tanks, an attack was launched yesterday to encircle and annihilate a regiment of the Chen bandit's 6th Column, which was stubbornly resisting around the Doufudian stronghold outside Baojia Settlement. It was captured at 2:00 AM this morning, and over a thousand remaining bandits were completely wiped out. The weather here turned sunny today, and the silver-winged forces are constantly sortieing into battle. The 5151-type heavy bomber squadrons are even more active over the battlefield. With the weather cooperating, the Li Corps resumed its eastward advance this morning, taking advantage of the victory to capture Baojia Settlement at noon, creating a major advance on the southern front. Another elite force made a surprise attack and completely annihilated a certain independent regiment of the bandits near Shuang Gou Settlement (about thirty li northwest of Huaiyuan) this afternoon. The meeting of the Li and Huang Corps is approaching a crucial moment. In addition to capturing Baojia Settlement on its left flank, the Li Corps' right flank is also advancing rapidly like an autumn wind sweeping away leaves, advancing west along the Xie River, capturing Yaozhuang, Shenzhuang, Sanguanmiao, and other places in succession today, and advancing towards Dawangzhuang and Chenji Settlement. There seems to be no major resistance along the way, and the distance between the vanguard and the positions of the Huang Corps is extremely limited. From a smooth perspective, a meeting may occur immediately. However, in addition to the original 2nd and 9th Columns of the Liu bandits, and the 6th Column of the Chen bandits, the Bohai Column has now been used to reinforce this area. The bandits' obstruction efforts are, of course, an expected fact.

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Bengbu, 13th] It is reported that Liu Bocheng's headquarters is located at Buzhuang, fifty li east of Suxian. Also, there are often more than ten thousand civilian laborers in the Henan-Anhui border area, who are coerced by the bandits and assigned to transportation work.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 13th] Lieutenant Colonel Chiang Wei-kuo led a powerful armored unit, together with certain powerful units of the National Army, and captured many important strongholds near Baojia Settlement and Chenji Settlement this afternoon. The entire 17th Regiment of the Bandit 11th Division was annihilated, and more than six hundred prisoners were captured alive.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 13th] Well-informed sources said on the evening of the 13th that the communist army has been attacking the Xuzhou-Bengbu area for more than a month. Due to heavy losses, they have had to use poorly trained militiamen and captured soldiers of the National Army to fight on the front lines. It was also said that the communist army attacks more frequently than the National Army, while the National Army has high walls and deep trenches to defend, so the communist army's losses are far greater than those of the National Army. They also believe that the communist army may abandon the Xuzhou-Bengbu offensive and wait until next spring to make another move.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Neutral military observers said today that the communist army tied down by the Huang Wei Corps northwest of Suxian is at least 80,000 men. Once these 80,000 men are moved to the Huai River line, the National Army on that line will be under heavy pressure. Currently, the 6th and 8th Corps of the National Army on the Huai River line have a strength of about 80,000 men, and must obtain reinforcements in the future to resist the communist army's expanded offensive.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] In recent days, when civilian aircraft have been supplying ammunition to the National Army north of Bengbu by air, they have sometimes been hit by communist underground artillery fire, and some aircraft bodies have been hit by bullets. It is learned that the National Army's fighter squadron has been strafing with machine guns near the aerial supply area to eliminate the danger when civilian aircraft drop supplies.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 13th] The railway near Guandian, which was damaged on the evening of the 12th, was completely repaired on the morning of the 13th. Passenger and freight trains between Bengbu and Pukou are running smoothly. The Beijing-Shanghai Comfort Mission also changed to boarding the train and returning south at 10:00 AM today.

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Bengbu, 13th] After Deng Wenyi finished his official business in Bengbu, Liu Zhi had important matters to request instructions on, and took a special plane to Beijing overnight this afternoon.

### Lin Biao's Troops Move En Masse into Shanhaiguan Pass: National Army Determined to Defend Beiping and Tianjin; Garrison in Tangshan Withdraws from City, Causing Chaos

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The North China Pacification Headquarters announced today that the garrison in Tangshan and staff of various agencies took the initiative to withdraw from Tangshan City on the afternoon of the 12th. No fighting occurred, and all personnel and public property have safely arrived at the planned area.

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The National Army in Tangshan took the initiative to withdraw. An emergency alarm was issued in Tangshan City on the morning of the 12th, and everyone felt panicked. The city was in chaos, and military, government, education personnel, and refugees all rushed to the train station. The highest military commander stationed in Tangshan then dispatched all eight train cars at the station, preparing to open them south. At the same time, trains full of refugees also arrived from Guye, east of Tangshan. The order at the station was extremely chaotic, with people desperately fighting to get on each train. At 12:00, communist hidden agents were active in the city, and there were many cases of looting materials. At 2:30, the command car of the highest military person in charge was the first to leave Tangshan. The roofs and doors of each train were crowded with refugees, and some were hit by the bridge top and fell into the river. The situation was extremely tragic. All the trains that have left Tangshan have safely arrived in the Tianjin-Tanggu area.

[Another Dispatch] This morning at 7:00, the Tianjin Kailuan General Bureau still had telecommunications contact with the Kailuan Mining Company in Tangshan, but then the connection was lost. Currently, in addition to the chief of Kailuan Mining being stranded in Beiping, most of the other senior officers have not left Tangshan. The current chief engineer of the Tangshan mining area, De Flange, is in charge of everything. Defenses between Tanggu and Lutai in northeastern Tianjin have been strengthened.

Spokesman of the Pacification Headquarters Speaks

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The spokesman of the North China Pacification Headquarters recently issued a statement on the current military situation, saying: Lin Biao's bandit troops moved en masse into Shanhaiguan Pass and are advancing towards Beiping and Tianjin. In order to coordinate the overall situation, the National Army reluctantly withdrew from some strongholds. Zhangjiakou originally planned to withdraw according to plan, but the people of Zhangjiakou feared a cruel massacre and, with tears in their eyes, refused to let the National Army leave. Forced by circumstances, a part of the National Army was stationed in Zhangjiakou. We will firmly defend both Beiping and Tianjin, one being a cultural ancient capital and the other being an industrial base. Neither should be subjected to any destruction or damage. Therefore, we will do everything possible to properly protect the cultural relics and historical sites of Beiping and the industrial equipment of Tianjin. But since it is a city defense, the compatriots in the city will inevitably experience some suffering in their lives and spirits. This is the encounter of China's suffering destiny, which is truly unavoidable. On the one hand, we are willing to do our best to assist in life. We have absolute confidence in firmly defending. We hope that our compatriots will be patient and calm, and ensure order and security in the city.

### Beiping Enters Military State

Bandits Attacking North of Beiping Repelled

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Beiping has entered a military state. The curfew will be advanced to start at 8:00 PM on the 13th. Sandbags have been piled up at the gates of the city, barbed wire has been erected, and fortifications have been built around the city. The troops guarding the Xiyuan Airport have all entered their fortifications. Airplanes land, unload, and immediately take off, which is very tense.

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Martial law has been declared in the western suburbs of Beiping starting from the afternoon of the 13th. The Agricultural College of Peking University has moved into the city, and many Yenching University students have also entered the city.

[Another Dispatch] Tsinghua University in the western suburbs of Beiping has taken on a wartime appearance. In the northern battle last night, two shells landed in Tsinghua Garden. Today, students are successively entering the city, reaching four-tenths of the total. President Mei Yi-qi has also entered the city.

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The Pacification Headquarters announced: At 2:00 PM on the 12th, a group of more than a thousand stray banditsçªå° near Zhenggezhuang, east of Shahe, north of Beiping. Strong units of the National Army counterattacked. After a night of fierce fighting, due to the major pressure on the northern front of the National Army, the bandits were forced to retreat south. At about 2:00 PM on the 13th, the bandits were lured to the Madouzhuang and Banbidian area between Qinghe and Shahe. The National Army ambushed from the north and south, and after two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and fled northwest. The National Army is currently tracking and pursuing them.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The North China Pacification Headquarters announced at 11:00 PM on the 13th: In the fierce battle in Qinghe at noon on the 13th, the National Army inflicted a heavy blow on the Lin bandits and achieved an initial victory. The 4th Column of the Lin bandits took advantage of the gap at noon on the 13th from Changping to attack Qinghe. The National Army gave the bandits a head-on blow and launched a fierce battle in the Qinghe area. From morning to dusk, the sound of artillery boomed. All our officers and soldiers conserved their energy and bravely charged and killed, and the remaining bandits finally could not withstand it and were defeated and retreated. According to preliminary statistics of the battle results, a total of 200 bandits were captured, and more than 20 heavy and light machine guns and more than 300 rifles were seized.

### Gu Zhutong Reports on Military Affairs at KMT Memorial Week

Believes Future of the War Situation Can Definitely Be Optimistic

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Central Committee of the Kuomintang held a memorial week this morning, chaired by Li Zongren. Gu Zhutong, Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, reported on recent military affairs, outlining the recent situation of each battlefield. Gu expressed optimism about the future of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. He said: In this Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, the communist bandits have attacked en masse, which is giving our army an opportunity to annihilate them completely. In the past, our army has repeatedly sought but could not get an opportunity to fight a decisive battle with the main force of the communist bandits. Now, our northern and southern corps are jointly attacking the main force of the communist bandits. Another route of our army is also successively reinforcing the front line. I believe the future of the war situation can definitely be optimistic.

### Communist Bandits Gather in the Luohe-Yellow River Triangle Area, Plotting Disturbances in Hanyang;

Bandit Troops Gathered in Northern Hubei

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Xi'an, 13th] The bandits in the triangular area between the Luohe River and the Yellow River have been frequently moving in recent days. Currently, four columns have gathered near Hanyang, and there are signs of plotting disturbances.

### Hoffman Hosts Reporters in Muddy Pond, Explains Future Policies of Economic Cooperation, Visiting the President in Beijing Today and Flying to Tokyo Tomorrow

[Report from this newspaper] Hoffman has decided to visit Beijing today, two days after arriving in Shanghai, to visit the President and other government officials. He is scheduled to take a US military plane in Beijing on the 15th and fly directly to Seoul and then to Tokyo. He is expected to fly back to the United States from Tokyo on the 17th, ending his trip to inspect the Economic Cooperation work in Europe and Asia.

[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Hoffman, Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, held a press conference at 2:30 PM yesterday on the first floor of the American Club here. US Ambassador to China Stuart Lei, the head of the ECA branch here, John R. Lapham, and Deputy Director Griffin all attended. After Lapham gave a brief introduction, Hoffman stood up and addressed the audience in a pleasant tone, saying: I was strongly invited by Mr. Lapham to come to China, and the purpose is to collect information rather than provide news, so I may disappoint you. However, if you have any questions, I will try my best to answer them within the realm of possibility.

Answering Reporters' Questions

Then, foreign reporters asked questions one after another. The focus was on whether the work of the Economic Cooperation Administration would also be adjusted if the current political situation changes. In response, Hoffman specifically quoted US Secretary of State Marshall's speech to Harvard University on June 5, 1947, on the basic concept of the US economic cooperation policy. That concept stated: The establishment of the basic concept of economic cooperation is not directed at any country or ideology, but starts from hunger, poverty, and chaos, in order to restore the world's economic capacity, maintain a free system, and enable free-loving people to exist and live under a government that guarantees freedom under that system. From this point of view, if the political situation in China changes, the Economic Cooperation Administration can only temporarily take a wait-and-see attitude to decide on its second step of aid to China measures.

A reporter asked, what kind of coalition government would allow the Economic Cooperation Administration to continue its aid to China work? Hoffman said that this question, in addition to involving political issues that he could not answer, only in terms of the economic position, the so-called coalition government must be able to truly represent the people's will, fully protect the people's freedom, and the government must be the legitimate successor of the existing government. The measures to continue aid to China can only be considered after the necessary performance is confirmed. The current National Government is still the only legitimate government, and the Economic Cooperation Administration will still target that government and its people as the object of ECA's assistance. Hoffman also stated that the current phase of the Economic Cooperation Administration's assistance work in China has only three months left before it comes to an end. Therefore, the development of work in these three months will have a decisive impact on the future aid to China policy. However, in these three months, the Economic Cooperation Administration will, depending on the development of the situation, effectively allocate the scheduled aid to China procedures. After this stage, new countermeasures will be considered separately.

Another reporter asked whether the Economic Cooperation Administration could continue to provide purely relief work under a communist government. Hoffman said that it would be difficult for the US government to approve a government solely controlled by the Communist Party, even for pure relief work. If any of the six major cities in Shanghai where the Economic Cooperation Administration supplies food is captured by the Chinese Communist Party, and the new regime has not been recognized by various countries, the Economic Cooperation Administration will not be able to sign any contracts with it. During the transition period, it will inevitably use the method of submitting a memorandum to determine the necessary measures afterwards.

Regarding the point that the Shanghai Economic Cooperation Administration borrowed rice from the Hong Kong government to relieve the food shortage in Shanghai in November of this year, whether it has exceeded the authority of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman replied: Lapham's emergency measures may have slightly exceeded the scope during busy work, but he still expressed his approval of Lapham's ability to take this extraordinary move. Finally, Hoffman and Lapham respectively answered some sporadic questions, the main points of which are summarized as follows: (1) Many industrial component plans are still in progress, but those with a long-term nature, or whose implementation location is already unsafe, have been temporarily suspended. (2) Economic Cooperation Administration ships to China have not yet loaded industrial components, but ships transporting grain will continue to come to China and will not be transferred to other uses. (3) The Economic Cooperation Administration's offices in Beijing and Shanghai are still paying attention to the development of the situation and have not considered moving.

### Speaker Pan Visits Brigadier General Barr, Extending Regards on Behalf of the Citizens of Shanghai

US Marines Will Land if Necessary

[Report from this city] Speaker Pan visited Brigadier General Barr at the Broadway Mansion at 3:30 PM yesterday to extend his regards on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, explaining that all circles in the city support the head of state and strive for self-defense, and plan to organize a merchant corps to cooperate with the police to maintain order. The business community has a long-standing business relationship with foreign expatriates in Shanghai and hopes to obtain close cooperation in maintaining local order. Brigadier General Barr stated that he would order the Marine Corps to land if necessary in order to fulfill his responsibility to protect overseas Chinese.

### US Fleet Leaves Qingdao, Rumored to Be Coming to Shanghai

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Qingdao, 13th] The aircraft carrier and other ships of the US 38th Special Mixed Fleet gradually left Qingdao Port this morning. Their destination is unknown, but it is rumored to be Shanghai.

[Associated Press, Report from this city] The US Marines, who protect overseas Chinese, will depart from Qingdao for Shanghai on the American transport ship "Peified" this week. However, according to the US naval authorities in this city, the order to depart has not yet been issued, so the exact date is still unknown. The number of Marines coming to Shanghai this time will not exceed 1,200 at most. According to reliable estimates, the number will be between 800 and 1,000. If the "Peified" carries 1,200 people, the ship will be extremely crowded. If it is insufficient in the future, another warship will carry the second batch of Marines to Shanghai.

Lieutenant General Barr arrived in this city again from Qingdao on the morning of the 13th and will fly back to Qingdao on the 14th.

### Ensure Stability in Shanghai, Develop Various Regions of Jiangnan

[Report from this newspaper] Leaders from all circles in this city, arranged by Speaker Pan, went to the Economic Cooperation Administration's office here yesterday morning to meet with Mr. Hoffman and exchange private opinions. Participants included Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongsheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Cheng Cangbo, Zhang Yi, Zhao Dihua, Xu Guomao, Hu Dunfu, Xu Xinyu, Xu Kejun, and more than a dozen others.

Speaker Pan told Hoffman that the current important plan is to protect and stabilize China's economic nerve center in Shanghai. 80% of China's industrial activities have been concentrated in Shanghai. If Shanghai's economic nerve center can maintain stability, the economic activities of various regions south of the Yangtze River that have not been affected by the war can rely on it for development and stability. Therefore, economic assistance work should pay attention to ensuring the stability of Shanghai. Liu Hongsheng and Zhang Yi also spoke in succession.

In addition to expressing that the United States will continue to maintain friendship with China and its people, Hoffman pointed out that his main job is to instruct and implement economic assistance plans, and that aid to China work still occupies an important part of the Economic Cooperation Administration's work.

Hoffman was invited to a banquet by the directors of the American Chamber of Commerce at noon. At 5:00 PM, Lapham held a reception at the American Club to welcome Hoffman. Many leaders and people from all walks of life in this city attended, including Pan Gongzhan, Li Ming, Zhang Jiaao, Zhang Yujiu, and Shou Jingwei. In a harmonious atmosphere, they exchanged opinions with the distinguished guest who came from afar. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00. Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the US Aid Utilization Committee, was ordered to come to Shanghai to welcome Hoffman and took a car back to Beijing at 11:00 PM on the 13th.

### National Army in Northern Jiangsu Launches Western Offensive, Momentum Like Breaking Bamboo, Vanguard Directly Approaching Tianchang

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Jiangdu, 12th] Reliable news: The war in northern Jiangsu is developing smoothly. (1) The National Army on the Yang(zhou)-Tian(chang) line began to launch a western offensive on the night of the 12th, with the momentum of breaking bamboo. Within 20 hours, it successively recovered strongholds such as Gongdao Bridge, Gouquanshan, and Yangjiamiao. The vanguard has crossed Dayi Settlement (sixty li west of Yangzhou City) tonight. The remaining bandits fled to Gaoyou Lake and the surrounding areas of Tianchang. The Yang-Tian Highway can be opened up. (2) The National Army advancing north on the Canal Line is advancing towards Sishui, and the fierce battle with the bandits is extremely intense.

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, 12th] Elite troops of the National Army crossed the Yangtze River to the north overnight. The National Army advancing east from Yang has stationed in Dayi Settlement and is now directly approaching the border of Tianchang County. It is also learned that the National Army in Baoying has taken the initiative to withdraw, and refugees from the county have gathered in Yangzhou.

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, 13th] The Jiangsu Provincial Security Headquarters decided at the Yangtze River defense meeting on the 13th that all boats and rafts coming and going along the Yangtze River must be docked at the south bank ferry for inspection.

They chased and arrested them. When chased to Xingang harbor, the bandit ships were eventually sunk by the Navy one by one. (2) Since the Navy controlled the bandit army's supply line on the Bohai Sea, any bandit ship that moved was either sunk or captured. Recently, the Navy discovered a giant bandit transport sailing ship using radar near the Laotieshan Channel and immediately dispatched it for arrest and capture. There was a lot of food among the materials carried by the bandit ship.

### Dong Zhao Analyzes the Current Situation, Says Guanzhong Can Absolutely Be Stabilized

Denies That Shaanxi Provincial Government Will Move to Hanzhong

[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Xi'an, 13th] Dong Zhao, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, analyzed the current situation at the provincial government's monthly meeting today, saying: There is absolutely no problem with stabilizing Guanzhong, because the National Army's strength is several times that of the bandits. Currently, the National Army has twelve reorganized divisions in Guanzhong, at least 250,000 mobile troops. Together with artillery and mechanized units, and local teams, the total can reach 400,000 to 500,000. The bandit Peng in northern Shaanxi has only five columns. After several losses, broken soldiers and remnants are at most only 120,000 people. The huge difference can be seen. Dong hoped that everyone would stabilize their hearts and not be confused by some temporary phenomena. The Shaanxi Southern Shaanxi Inspection Group of the Provincial Government has set off today. Chairman Dong told reporters today that rumors that the Provincial Government is preparing to move to Hanzhong are absolutely untrue.

### Editorial: The Issue of Appeals by Japanese War Criminals

The announcement that the U.S. Supreme Court has accepted the "appeals" of Japanese war criminals Hirota and Doihara and is preparing to review the judgments of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East has shocked world opinion. British representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Mr. Shaw, declared that this action by the U.S. Supreme Court damages the standing of the Far East Tribunal. Our country's chief judge, Mei Ru'ao, pointed out that this move is merely a delaying tactic and believes it will not undermine the Tribunal's judgments. Although General MacArthur has ordered a stay of execution for the seven Japanese war criminals sentenced to hang, his surprise at this development is clearly no less than that of other Allied nations. According to a United Press reporter's observation, the Supreme Court apparently does not plan to judge the guilt or innocence of the war criminals; rather, it aims to answer two questions: (1) Does the Supreme Court have the authority to review the judgments? If it has this authority, then (2) Was the International Military Tribunal for the Far East lawfully established by MacArthur? In terms of both legal principle and fact, our answer is no. We should protest the U.S. Supreme Court's acceptance of the "appeals" of the Japanese war criminals based on reason.

First, the U.S. Supreme Court has no right to accept the "appeals" of Japanese war criminals, let alone review the judgments of the international tribunal. According to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has no power to review war criminal judgments made by military tribunals established by the U.S. military. The legislative aim of this is to demonstrate the purity of the judiciary and not to interfere with military justice administration. Japan is not a colony of the United States, and the U.S. military's presence in Japan is to carry out the Allied occupation mission. The U.S. military in Japan did not secretly try Japanese war criminals in U.S. military tribunals. The trial of Japanese war criminals by the United States and ten other Allied nations, according to the Potsdam Declaration and Allied agreements, was entrusted to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. This tribunal is not only "international" in name, but the judges and prosecutors of the tribunal's organization are also appointed by plenipotentiary representatives of eleven countries. Its organization is not based on the domestic law of any one country but entirely on international law and precedent. U.S. law does not supersede the law of any Allied nation, and the U.S. Supreme Court is not superior to the International Military Tribunal. Therefore, its power cannot undermine any judgment made by the International Military Tribunal. Hirota and Doihara's filing of an "appeal" to the U.S. Supreme Court is a shameless attempt to prolong their lives. The U.S. Supreme Court's acceptance of the Japanese war criminals' "appeal" completely disregards international law and international tribunals. This is something we must protest.

Second, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East was established by the Allied Headquarters. The Allied Headquarters does not interfere with the trial of war criminals, and the international tribunal is independent and lawful. As is well known, the trial of Japanese war criminals is not a matter decided by the United States alone. It was established according to the Potsdam Declaration and Allied agreements. MacArthur, in law, held the position of an Allied commander, representing various countries in establishing and executing this tribunal's establishment. MacArthur's superior in administrative matters should be the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission. Of course, MacArthur is an American, and his actions are bound by U.S. law. However, MacArthur serves as the commander of the Allied forces stationed in Japan, and his administrative measures are accountable to the Far Eastern Commission, not to the United States. Therefore, the Allied Headquarters' responsibility for establishing the International Military Tribunal is a lawful measure. The Allied Headquarters' review of the judgments and execution of the original sentences is similarly based on law. We have the right to protest the U.S. Supreme Court's acceptance of the Japanese war criminals' "appeal," and we also have the right to demand that the Allied Headquarters not accept any interference and promptly execute the death sentences of Hirota, Doihara, Tojo, and the other seven, as well as the life sentences of Kido and Shigemitsu, and the fixed-term imprisonments of others, to maintain the credibility of the International Military Tribunal.

The judicial organization of the United States is pure and enlightened and has always been respected by the world. In February 1946, when Japanese Commander in the Philippines Yamashita Tomoyuki requested a writ of habeas corpus, the U.S. Supreme Court summarily refused, which was praised by the legal communities of various countries. Since the outbreak of World War II, the U.S. Supreme Court has maintained a completely objective attitude toward any military law judgments made by the Allied forces and the U.S. military, refraining from interference or disruption, which is sufficient to show that the U.S. judicial community admires reason and respects international custom. This sudden acceptance of the "appeals" of Japanese war criminals is truly a strange and disturbing matter. In addition to protesting this measure that violates the law and goes against custom, we hope that the U.S. Supreme Court will make a wise and pure judgment to avoid delaying the case. In short, the delay of this case is the delay of justice. The sacredness of the U.S. judiciary should not neglect justice and public reason. This is our opinion.

### Improving Measures for Depositing and Exchanging Gold and Silver; Decision to Submit to the Executive Yuan for Discussion; Authorities Not Considering Adjusting Gold Prices

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] In addition to conducting meticulous research, Minister of Finance Xu Kan extensively sought the opinions of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members and various experts regarding improving measures for depositing and exchanging gold and silver. It was decided to submit the proposal for approval at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 15th, after which it will be announced and implemented. Once these measures are announced, they will be uniformly implemented nationwide. The exchange procedures established by central banks in various regions are merely temporary measures and will be canceled at that time. The general content of the new measures was largely reported in this newspaper on the 11th. When military, police, government, and educational employees exchange, they may handle the deposit and exchange procedures with the Central Bank after approval by the responsible authority. However, when receiving gold, they must still personally bring their identification card, verify the photograph, and then receive it to prevent abuses. Furthermore, external rumors that gold prices will be adjusted after the implementation of the new measures are absolutely inaccurate. The authorities have not yet considered adjusting gold prices.

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] Governor of the Central Bank of China, Yu Hongjun, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 13th. In the afternoon, he attended a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee and discussed issues such as improving measures for depositing and exchanging gold and silver with Xu Kan.

### Xu Kan and Yu Hongjun Invited to Attend Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee

Report on the Situation of Depositing and Exchanging Gold and Silver

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee held a closed-door meeting on the afternoon of the 13th to discuss measures for depositing and exchanging gold and silver. Minister of Finance Xu Kan and Governor of the Central Bank of China, Yu Hongjun, were both invited to attend. After the meeting began at around 3:00 PM, Chairman Wu Yuechao immediately invited Finance Minister Xu to report on the current situation and prospects for the implementation of the policy for depositing and exchanging gold and silver. He emphasized that the national treasury's reserves are substantial. Regarding gold alone, after the currency reform, the national treasury collected over 1.8 million taels, bringing the total, including previous holdings, to over 5.5 million taels. Currently, deposits and exchanges nationwide amount to less than 200,000 taels, so there is absolutely no concern about a shortage. However, the government is not completely disregarding efforts to guide sources. Currently, two matters are being considered: (1) obtaining a portion of gold from U.S. aid, and (2) purchasing a considerable amount of gold and silver from foreign countries. The Finance Minister also explained that the government has noted the various aspects of exchange techniques awaiting improvement nationwide, as well as the unsatisfactory order and rampant black market caused by scalpers. Meetings have been held several times in the past week to discuss improvements. However, all discussions have focused on technical issues, and all external rumors are purely unfounded. The government has great confidence in the deposit and exchange policy and is determined to implement it thoroughly to absorb idle funds and stabilize prices. Governor Yu then explained the actual situation of the Central Bank's handling of deposits and exchanges since its implementation, providing a detailed description of large-scale purchases by major players in the market and scalpers crowding overnight. He stated that the Central Bank, as the implementing agency of this policy, will continue to work hard to improve procedures and prevent abuses so that ordinary people can conveniently deposit and prevent wealth from being concentrated in the hands of a few major players and scalpers who profit from the middle, disrupting the financial system. After Yu's report, the committee members spoke in turn. Combining their common opinions, they amounted to the following points: (1) The government should pay attention to the gold and silver reserves to determine whether deposits and exchanges can be handled indefinitely, and constantly find ways to replenish the national treasury. (2) If the deposit and exchange policy can continue indefinitely, it should be implemented long-term to overcome the deeply rooted societal tendency to value gold and silver over currency, thereby restoring the government's long-lost credibility. (3) Regarding exchange techniques, major players exchanging over ten taels of gold must first fill out a purchase certificate, which must be approved before they can deposit or exchange. For those under ten taels, efforts should be made to ensure widespread participation, and if necessary, various commercial banks can be widely entrusted to act as agents. Regarding facilitating deposits and exchanges for government and educational employees, there should be no problem in principle, but the specific technical methods still need to be studied. Some committee members advocated exclusively handling deposits and exchanges for government and educational employees on holidays, but there are also concerns about crowding. Some committee members suggested that various agencies handle it on a unified basis, but the Ministry of Finance believes that government and educational personnel have few spare funds for deposits and exchanges, and they would inevitably be bothered by relatives and friends, turning them into special scalpers. As for issuing salary payments combined with exchanges for silver dollars at the time of salary distribution, there are also concerns about wage issues, which also need to be carefully considered. At the end of the meeting, Xu and Yu expressed their deep gratitude for the opinions of the committee members. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

### Supervisory Yuan Submits Corrective Proposal; Urges Adoption of Remedial Measures

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The Supervisory Yuan has submitted a corrective proposal regarding the Central Bank's improper handling of deposit and exchange procedures and the soaring black market prices of gold and silver, which are affecting currency confidence. The proposal was submitted by Supervisory Yuan members Yu Zhenzhou, Wang Xiangchen, Zhao Xi, and others. It was passed by the second temporary meeting of the Supervisory Yuan's Finance and Food Committee held at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, requesting the Executive Yuan to take swift and effective measures to remedy the situation. The proposal included the following corrective opinions: (1) To enable people to have equal deposit and exchange opportunities, staggered processing should be implemented. Each household should be limited to one deposit and exchange per period. The second period should only be continued after all households registered in the first period have been processed. (2) When ordinary citizens apply for deposits and exchanges, they should submit their identification cards for verification (all newly issued or reissued identification cards must be valid for three months to prevent abuses). After review and registration, a permit with an assigned number should be issued, and the identification card should be stamped (with the period number, permit number, and amount deposited or exchanged). Then, processing should be carried out in the order of the numbers. The Central Bank should announce the numbers to be processed each day one day in advance. Overdue applications will not be accepted. If necessary, the deposit and exchange funds may be collected at once when the permit is issued. (3) The maximum amount of gold and silver that each household can apply for exchange should be strictly limited (gold should not exceed two taels in principle) so that the people can deposit and exchange widely. (4) A number of days (or an average of one to two days per week) should be designated each period to specifically handle deposits and exchanges for civil and military government and educational personnel. Each agency and school should prepare a list, along with identification cards and deposit and exchange funds to be submitted to the accepting bank for processing, and then the original agency or school should collect and distribute the funds. (5) The government should swiftly adopt effective methods to eliminate the gold and silver black market and strictly crack down on fixed and mobile gold and silver vendors. For black market gold and silver transactions, the gold and silver should be confiscated or purchased at the official price, depending on the severity of the circumstances. The justification for the proposal mentioned the current abuses in the deposit and exchange situation, as well as the fact that various accepting banks are handling negative deposits and exchanges outside of daily business hours, taking advantage of the opportunity to collude internally and fraudulently purchase various realities, which is considered extremely unreasonable and should be corrected immediately.

### Cause of Shanghai-Taiwan Flight Accident; Investigation Reveals Collision with Mountain While Seeking Route; Treatment of Injured Passengers Progressing Well

[Our Taipei Office, 13th] The cause of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Shanghai-Taiwan flight accident has now been determined. The pilot of the aircraft, Liang Zhaolai, was an excellent driver with seventeen years of flying experience. When flying to Wenzhou, he realized that the weather was terrible, so he flew at a high altitude of 8,000 meters. When he reached the airspace above Tamsui, it was already past one o'clock in the afternoon. Affected by the low air pressure and the airflow from the hot spring water sources, the aircraft suddenly dropped to 1,500 meters. At that time, the fog was thick, and the direction could not be distinguished. He had no choice but to descend to find a route. When he discovered the Caigongkeng Mountain, which was more than 1,000 meters above sea level, blocking the road, it was unavoidable. Fortunately, pilot Liang quickly made an oblique flight, avoiding a head-on collision, and landed abruptly. The wings collided with the mountain rocks and caught fire. The passengers in the front row were burned by the fire, and most of the other passengers were also stunned. Fortunately, Yang Qing, Director of the Taiwan Office of the Resources Committee, was in the rear and bravely opened the aircraft door. Some of the conscious passengers helped the unconscious ones to jump down, resulting in injuries to many limbs. The treatment of the injured is progressing very well, but the telegraph operator Zhou Jinrong has all four limbs broken and a severe head injury and has not yet escaped danger. CNAC has already flown a special plane to the scene for inspection and may return to Shanghai that day. All today's flights arrived safely, but due to the worsening weather in the afternoon, they are scheduled to return to Shanghai tomorrow morning.

### Hankou to Resume Exchanging Gold and Silver from Today

[Our Hankou Office, 13th] The issuance of applications for exchanging gold and silver, which has been suspended here for many days, will resume tomorrow. It is also stipulated that soldiers applying for applications will be handled by the 12th Regiment of the Military Police, and citizens will be handled by the Police Department to prevent troublemakers. Furthermore, as of the 10th, Hankou City has exchanged 5,334 taels of gold and over 1.34 million silver dollars.

### Postal Remittance Bureau Raises Exchange Rate; Supervisory Yuan to Submit Corrective Proposal

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] Supervisory Yuan member Wang Xiangchen and others have recently submitted a corrective proposal to the Executive Yuan regarding the arbitrary increase in the exchange rate for small remittances by the Postal Remittance Bureau and other national banks, which is increasing the burden on ordinary people. It was passed by the Supervisory Yuan's Finance and Food Committee on the 13th. The proposal expressed dissatisfaction with the Postal Remittance Bureau's most recent adjustment of the exchange rate, which was 20/100, an excessive increase. The proposal also stated that it seems that national banks are completely standing on a position that is contrary to the interests of ordinary people, which is something that the people of the country cannot understand. It should request the Executive Yuan to promptly correct this and order all national banks to effectively reduce the exchange rate for small remittances and ensure that it does not exceed the standard set by the Central Bank.

### Division Commander Liu Shenghe Dies in Battle of Bayiji

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Liu Shenghe, Division Commander of the 44th Division of the 100th Army under General Huang Baitao's corps, was ordered on November 9, during the intense Battle of Xudong, to lead his troops at the railway bridge over the Grand Canal on the Longhai Road to cover the westward retreat of 300,000 soldiers and civilians from Haizhou. After completing the mission, he was again ordered on the 10th to advance to Bayiji, where he encountered the Communist's rapid column and the 4th, 8th, and 13th columns, and was immediately surrounded. At that time, six regiments of Division Commander Liu's troops were still on the line of the Grand Canal, and only one regiment was fighting the Communist's four columns.

### Hoffman's Written Statement (Continued from Page 1)

We reprint Hoffman's written statement issued yesterday as follows:

I have been very happy to visit China, even though my time here has been very short. I have been concerned about China and the Chinese people for many years, and I have many Chinese friends here. However, this is the first opportunity I have had in my life to come to China, so when Mr. Lapham suggested that I come to China for an on-site observation last October, I agreed without urging.

Originally, I hoped that my first visit to China would be leisurely, but I regret that this trip is urgent and almost entirely for official business. However, on the other hand, I am very pleased that this trip is related to the ECA's economic assistance program, which aims to support and supplement the efforts of the Chinese people to strengthen their national economic position. When I met with President Truman on the eve of my departure from Washington, the President specifically instructed me to convey the long-standing and continuous friendship of the United States for the Chinese people, because friendship, mutual respect, and common interests have been the cornerstone of Sino-American relations and remain the basis of American policy to this day.

The purpose of my visit to China is not to decide or explain American policy toward China, because I am not qualified or authorized to resolve the complex military and political issues involved in that policy. The ECA's task is only to implement the economic plans passed by the President and Congress. We are not responsible for obtaining or implementing military assistance.

Our current task is to make the most of the funds for this assistance program that have not yet been allocated and to make any suggestions to Congress regarding future programs sound and complete. The basic policy must be decided by Congress.

I am very satisfied and enlightened to have this opportunity to see the work status and problems of the ECA China program. No matter how accurate the telegram reports from thousands of miles away are, they cannot compare with even a very short on-site inspection.

So far, I feel that Mr. Lapham's report has omitted one point, namely, that he did not mention the outstanding achievements made by himself and the staff of the branch office. The success of the ECA's program in this difficult period cannot be attributed to the perfect cooperation and valuable opinions provided by Dr. Wong Wen-hao and other members of the US Aid Committee. After talking with President Sun Ke, I am confident that under his leadership, the ECA will receive the same friendship and assistance.

### Another Batch of Materials Plundered by Japan During the War Returned to Our Country Valued at US$733,000

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] The Allied Headquarters today returned to our country another batch of materials plundered by Japan during the war, with a total value of US$733,000. Furthermore, the Allied Headquarters has now received a suggestion from the Repatriation Advisory Committee to return materials to China with a total value of US$52,000. Wu Bannong, head of the Repatriation and Compensation Group of our country's delegation in Japan, said that the main items returned today include 771 pieces of machinery, valued at approximately US$583,000, while others include tin ingots, zinc, lead, vehicles, and books. As for the main items recommended to be returned to our country today, there are 33 pieces of machinery with a total value of US$48,000, including power generators, lathes, and shearing machines. Others include 49 kilograms of tin ingots valued at US$111, 2,483 kilograms of antimony ingots valued at US$2,103, one sedan valued at US$1,100, and printing machines from the Hong Kong branch of the Commercial Press valued at US$3,750. The printing machines will be transferred by the UK delegation to the Hong Kong Commercial Press branch.

### Ministry of Finance Issues Order to All Regions: Suppress Illegal Silver Dollar Vendors; The "Clinking" Sounds in the Capital No Longer Heard

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Recently, the Ministry of Finance, noting that silver dollar vendors in various regions were engaging in buying and selling silver coins, arbitrarily raising prices, creating a black market, and affecting the financial system, has dispatched telegrams to military and police agencies in the capital and financial management bureaus in all regions, ordering them to earnestly suppress these activities and immediately eliminate silver dollar vendors.

[Further Telegram] The Capital Police Department mobilized police officers on the 13th to suppress vendors privately buying and selling silver dollars and foreign currency. The "clinking" sounds in the Xinjiekou and Jiankang Road areas are no longer heard. A spokesperson for the Police Department stated: "After the government announced revisions to all regulations regarding the handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency, private buying and selling of gold, silver, and foreign currency remains prohibited by the government. However, as time passed, this practice resurfaced, and recently it has been reported that unscrupulous individuals are absorbing these items at high prices, leading to an increasingly rampant black market. This greatly disrupts the financial system and commodity prices. Previously, this department strictly ordered all bureaus to intensify suppression efforts. Today alone, over one hundred cases of suppression have been carried out. We will continue to rigorously enforce these measures in the future. The erroneous mindset of a small number of citizens who value silver over legal tender is also a cause for the existence of the black market. Therefore, we hope that citizens of this city, based on their enthusiasm for supporting the government in suppressing rebellion and building the nation, will assist the Police Department in implementing these legal measures."

### Third UN General Assembly Declares Adjournment; Approves US-China-Australia Proposal on Korean Issue; Establishes Seven-Nation Committee to Monitor Troop Withdrawal and Promote Korean Unification

[United Press, Paris, 12th] The United Nations Paris General Assembly, lasting twelve weeks, finally adjourned tonight. Prior to adjournment, the US-China-Australia proposal on the Korean issue was approved by a vote of 48 to 6, with only the Soviet bloc voting against and Sweden abstaining. The Assembly was originally scheduled to adjourn last night, but Soviet representative Malik's delaying tactics hindered the vote on the Korean issue, leading to a one-day extension of the meeting. During the afternoon session on Sunday, Malik continued to vehemently criticize the US and South Korea, but the representatives had no intention of debating further. It was said that representatives of Western countries adopted a "silent strategy" to force adjournment. Malik finally demanded that the Assembly vote on the Soviet proposal to end the work of the Korean Committee, which was rejected by a vote of 46 to 6. The content of the US-China-Australia proposal approved by the Assembly includes: (1) Recognizing the work of the Korean Committee. (2) Recognizing the South Korean government elected under the supervision of the UN delegation as the legitimate government. (3) Recommending that US and Soviet occupying forces withdraw from Korea as soon as possible within a feasible scope. (4) Ordering the Korean Committee to continue its work for another year, attempting to promote the unification of North and South Korea. (5) Ordering the Korean Committee to be responsible for supervision upon the withdrawal of occupying forces. The Assembly also passed a Canadian amendment, recommending that the Korean Committee be replaced by a seven-nation standing committee instead of the current nine-nation temporary committee. The Canadian representative stated that the current nine-nation committee includes China, France, Australia, Canada, India, the Philippines, El Salvador, Syria, and Ukraine, but Ukraine has never attended, so it is effectively only eight nations, which makes it difficult to pass important resolutions. Therefore, Canada requested to withdraw, making it a seven-nation committee.

[United Press, Paris, 12th] South Korean delegation leader Chang Taek-sang stated today that the UN's recognition of South Korea has "historical significance," and members of the delegation and the entire nation are extremely pleased to hear of it. He sincerely hopes that the UN can grant South Korea membership "in the shortest possible time." He dared to assure "all friendly nations" that South Korea would never surrender to communism or totalitarianism.

[United Press, Paris, 13th] The Republic of South Korea formally applied to join the United Nations today.

[United Press, Seoul, 13th] Today, the entire nation celebrated after the UN recognized South Korea. Furthermore, the South Korean parliament today approved the US economic aid to Korea agreement. ECA Administrator Hoffman will soon arrive in Korea to take over the aid work.

### UN General Assembly Shows Little Achievement; The East-West Divide Deepens; Security Council to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Applications from Siam and Israel

[United Press, Paris, 13th] This session of the UN General Assembly can be said to have achieved little and has deepened the East-West divide. However, the representatives can at least console themselves on their return journey that when they came to Paris in early September, they were apprehensive that a major war might break out, but it has not broken out to this day.

[United Press, Paris, 13th] The Paris UN General Assembly can be said to have ended on an unhappy note. The Soviet representatives still had courage to muster in the final minutes, accusing the United States. Soviet representative Vyshinsky declared after the Soviet proposal on the Korean issue was rejected that the Paris Assembly was not worthy of praise and would be historically referred to as a progression of policies that undermined international cooperation.

[United Press, Paris, 13th] After the end of the UN General Assembly in Paris, the next General Assembly will convene at Lake Success on April 1st of next year. The representatives have departed, and the members of the Security Council will remain in Paris until the end of the year. Furthermore, it is reported that the Security Council is scheduled to meet on the 15th to discuss the applications for membership from Siam and Israel. The Hyderabad issue is also on the agenda.

[Agence France-Presse, Beirut, 12th] The Third Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization passed the US representative's suggestion in a welcoming atmosphere today, requesting that the organization promote the recently passed Declaration of Human Rights by the UN General Assembly as widely as possible.

### Vyshinsky and Others Fly Back to Moscow

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The Soviet delegation to the United Nations, led by Vyshinsky, left here this morning by plane to return to Moscow.

[United Press, London, 13th] Tass reported on the 13th about the conclusion of the UN General Assembly, stating that Dulles, Schumann, as well as the representatives of China, Britain, and Mexico, "wanted to use various methods to reduce the resentment of world public opinion caused by the widespread use of US dictatorial policies."

### Bevin to Visit Paris; To Improve Anglo-French Relations

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] The Daily Mirror carried this morning that Anglo-French relations may be a matter for discussion when Bevin personally goes to Paris after Christmas to meet with French authorities. It was also stated that relations between the two countries have not been as bad as they are today since the Vichy era. The newspaper cited the following reasons for the difficulty in improving relations between the two countries: (1) The French government's rejection of the British four-year plan; (2) French resentment of Britain's policy of reviving German industry; (3) France's renewed distrust of Britain.

### Establishment of East Germany; May Be Realized Next Spring

### Mediterranean Joint Defense

Will Be Produced Following the Atlantic Treaty

[United Press, London, 12th] According to officials on the 12th: Once the Atlantic Treaty currently being discussed in Washington concludes, Western Europe's attention will shift to the Mediterranean Defense Treaty. A spokesperson stated: While Western European Union countries and the US and Canada are carefully constructing a global security system to prevent possible Soviet aggression, it is generally believed that the Mediterranean region is a gap in the system. It is generally believed that Italy will be an important role in the new treaty, and it is suggested that negotiations for this new treaty will include resolving the future fate of the Italian colonies in North Africa. The central work of the Mediterranean Treaty has not yet been produced, but it is generally stated that all efforts are currently focused on the Atlantic Treaty.

### Memoirs Reveal Secrets; Poland was Tricked by Roosevelt

[United Press, New York, 13th] Former Polish Prime Minister and leader of the Peasant Party, Mikolajczyk, who is currently in exile in the United States, has published his memoirs, "The Rape of Poland - A Typical Example of Soviet Aggression." It says that in June 1944, President Roosevelt told Mikolajczyk that it could be determined that Stalin was not an aggressor and would never dare to deprive Poland of its freedom, because he knew that the US government was "firmly supporting you." As a result, 15,000 people were collectively massacred in 1940 and buried in mass graves.

### All-India Congress Committee Meeting; Scheduled to Open on Thursday

### Costa Rica Notifies Security Council; Accuses Nicaragua of Violating Territory; Pan American Organization Prepares to Mediate

[United Press, Paris, 12th] Costa Rica formally notified the President of the Security Council, stating that armed forces from Nicaragua invaded Costa Rican territory at 11:00 PM on December 10. However, Costa Rica did not request the Security Council to take action. It is widely believed that the Security Council will not intervene in the dispute unless formally requested to do so. However, the Nicaraguan government denied the Costa Rican government's accusations, stating that those who entered Costa Rican territory came from the sea, not from bases located in Nicaraguan territory.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The Council of the Organization of American States (OAS) decided to meet on the 14th to determine whether to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of all American countries to discuss the issue of Costa Rica accusing Nicaragua of supporting rebels to invade its territory. At the same time, the Council sent a telegram to the governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, stating that it hoped that they would fully cooperate in maintaining order in the Americas, and at the same time work together to effectively realize the necessary means to maintain peace.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] Observers here believe that the discord between Costa Rica and its neighbors is closely related to the future of inter-American relations and may be a test of the Rio Treaty to see if it has real value in seeking peaceful solutions to inter-American disputes.

[Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 12th] Costa Rica, a small country in Central America, is now facing armed attacks from its northern neighbor Nicaragua. The Costa Rican government has ordered general mobilization to cope with the threat. It is learned here that the invading forces are composed of Nicaraguans and Costa Rican anti-government figures led by former Costa Rican President CalderÃ³n Guardia. Costa Rican interim President Figueres recently declared that this military development is not a revolution against his government, but a war between Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Figueres requested the use of the Inter-American Defense Treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1947 to ensure the safety of Costa Rica. It is noted that Figueres ordered the dissolution of Costa Rica's national defense force of only 500 people on December 1, declaring Costa Rica a peaceful country. The armed forces remaining in Costa Rica are only about 1,000 police officers. Because after CalderÃ³n Guardia left office in February this year and was succeeded by President Picado, Picado's government was overthrown by Figueres, and Figueres replaced him as interim president. CalderÃ³n Guardia and Picado fled to Nicaragua to plot an uprising and subvert Figueres' regime. When they planned to send troops in Nicaragua, they received support from Nicaraguan dictator Somoza.

[Report from Our Newspaper] For businesses in this city that have paid business tax for less than four seasons since the autumn of 1947, the base number for calculating the tax payment has been resolved by the Shanghai Municipal Business Tax Simplification and Inspection Committee.

For those who opened in the spring and summer of 1948 or the winter of 1947, and those who had no business activity for one, two, or three seasons during the period from the autumn of 1947 to the summer of 1948, the period of no business activity will be determined by referring to the total tax amount reported by businesses throughout the city for the autumn and winter of 1947 and the spring and summer seasons of 1948, proportional extrapolation will be used to determine the tax amount payable for the autumn season. Businesses that cease operations in the autumn of 1948 should report at any time, and report and pay tax as it occurs, and then rely on the investigation.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The national measures to improve gold and silver exchange, carried by Yu Hongjun to Beijing the night before last (the 12th) with currency, may be decided upon within days.

### Mystery of Cotton Cloth for Rice Becomes Increasingly Baffling; Cloth Still in China Textile Factory; Rice Merchants Refused Delivery Yesterday

As various circles express deep suspicion about the exchange of 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth for rice, hoping that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Committee and the Municipal Authorities will thoroughly investigate the matter, the Rice Merchants Association sent representatives at 10:00 AM on the 13th, holding 10,000 bolts of "Four Gentlemen" drill bills of lading from the China Textile Construction Company's 60,000 bolts of cotton cloth, to the company's First Printing and Dyeing Factory for delivery.

Therefore, the company had to temporarily suspend the delivery of the current cotton cloth.

### Tongji University Food Shortage; Two Meals a Day; "Life-Saving Auction"

(Our Newspaper's Report) Tongji University has been suffering from a food shortage, and students have been reduced to two meals a day since last week. The school previously borrowed 120 dan of rice from the People's Livelihood Coordination Committee and purchased a portion itself. It can only last for one or two days now, and they are urging the People's Livelihood Coordination Committee to issue the rice allocated for December as soon as possible. In addition to launching a food storage campaign, in order to cope with the current food shortage and the future living problems, the College of Liberal Arts sponsored a "Life-Saving Auction" yesterday. Students from various colleges sent clothes, stationery, supplies, etc. to be auctioned to maintain their livelihood by selling the proceeds. So far, a total of more than 200 students have applied to return to their hometowns or transfer schools, and most of the others are taking a wait-and-see attitude, deciding whether to return to their hometowns depending on the changes in the situation. The school authorities have so far stated that they will still hold the final exam on schedule in mid-January, and the Ministry of Education has not yet given instructions on the issue of relocation.

Xia Jianbai, the president of the school, told reporters: In addition to the two dou of rice allocated by the People's Livelihood Coordination Committee for public-funded students, the Ministry of Education also provides three sheng, which are converted into cash at market prices. However, the non-staple food fee is currently 40 yuan. In fact, the 40 yuan non-staple food fee is not enough to cover the expenses of vegetables, cooking oil, and fuel, so most of the price of these three sheng of rice has been used to supplement it.

### Rediscount Committee Approves Measures to Purchase Finished Products; National Banks Begin Processing Industrial Loans; Industrial Sector Believes Loan Interest Rates are Too High

[Report from this newspaper] The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee formally began processing emergency industrial loans yesterday. All application forms have been sent to national banks and commercial firms. Last Saturday, factories directly applied to the Rediscount Committee, which has issued over a thousand application forms to date. After receiving applications from various manufacturers, the Rediscount Committee will submit them to the Trade, Industry, and Agriculture Advisory Committees for review and comments before presenting them to the Rediscount Committee for final approval. The Rediscount Committee held a meeting yesterday, approving several applications. The detailed measures for purchasing finished products were also established by the committee as follows:

(1) The handling of finished product purchase cases should be limited to those where the finished products have poor short-term sales and the business needs to be maintained. (2) The objects of purchase should be limited to the following items: (A) Daily necessities: cotton textiles, leather, paper, soap, matches, medicines; (B) Basic industrial and mining enterprises: steel, cement, machinery, coal; (C) Other industrial and mining specialties that meet the purchase criteria. (3) The quantity of purchase should not exceed the average monthly output of each manufacturer in the past six months. (4) After the finished product purchase case is approved, the Business Bureau of this bank will be notified to advance funds and entrust various banks and treasuries to organize separately or jointly within their professional scope. (5) The applicant manufacturer should fill in and submit the relevant information in accordance with the regulations for review. (6) The procedures for purchasing finished product prices and acceptance of delivery shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions: (A) The purchase price shall be based on the average market price of the six days prior to the signing of the contract; (B) After the entrusted bank signs the purchase contract, it shall immediately accept the finished products and pay the price. After the acceptance is completed, it shall handle the transfer procedures with the Central Bank and pay the relevant warehouse receipts to the Central Bank for verification. (7) The disposal of purchased finished products shall be based on the principle of auction, which shall be handled by the relevant authorities entrusted by the Central Bank at any time, and a handling fee shall be paid. (8) After the purchased finished products are disposed of in accordance with the provisions of Article 7, the proceeds shall be remitted to the Central Bank at any time to recover the advances.

Moreover, in the handling of this industrial loan, the authorities emphasized strict review to prevent funds from flowing into the speculative market and stimulating prices; however, the industrial sector is also dissatisfied with the current measures, primarily believing that the loan interest rate is too high, making it difficult for factories to bear. Secondly, the valuation of finished products for purchase, based on the average price of the previous six days, is considered too low because the prices of most industrial finished products are currently below cost.

### Prices of Various Commodities Rise; Rice Market Remains Firm; Flour, Bran, and Edible Oil All Surge

Yesterday, the rice market, influenced by the rise in the prices of various commodities, also surged. Sellers were very firm, calling for higher prices from the morning, holding up prices quite strongly. Prices rose by 30 to 40 yuan in the morning, briefly weakening due to slightly sluggish sales, but turning firm again by the close. In the South Market, Bai Geng and Bo Dao were both priced at 375 yuan, each rising by 35 yuan. Early rice rose by 45 yuan, priced at 365 yuan. Xian rice rose by 20 to 30 yuan. In the North Market, Bai Geng was priced at 375 yuan, a rise of 25 yuan, and Bo Dao rose by 35 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 13,576 piculs arrived in the North and South Markets.

Flour

Rose sharply, influenced by the rise in rice prices. Sentiment was quite firm, and retail investors successively bought in, making the market exceptionally brisk. Old car flour opened at 160 yuan and then rose further to 162 yuan, a sharp increase of 16 yuan compared to the previous day. Soldier Ship flour fluctuated significantly, opening at 147 yuan, rising to 160 yuan at one point, and then falling back to 152 yuan at the close, a rise of 16 yuan. Xiong brand flour consistently rose by 15 to 16 yuan. Bran rose sharply by 15%.

Grains

Rose across the board. Due to the rise in rice prices, sentiment also turned firm, and guest traders purchased actively, leading to consistent price increases. Yellow beans rose by 15 yuan, picked green beans rose by 10 yuan, and corn and red sorghum were purchased by guest traders, leading to the strongest price increases, with corn rising by 20% and red sorghum rising sharply by 25%. Sesame rose by 20 to 30 yuan, and raw kernels continued to be purchased by Cantonese traders, rising by another 40 to 50 yuan.

Edible Oil

Yesterday's rise turned fierce. Due to the rise in rice prices, prices were raised by 70 to 80 yuan at the opening, and later, due to the significant rise in the prices of various commodities, retail investors bought in, and soybean oil finally broke through the 1,000 yuan mark, reaching as high as 1,040 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil was 930 yuan, each rising by 150 yuan, reaching 15%. Raw oil was 1,040 yuan. Soybean cake was 80 yuan, a rise of 7 to 8 yuan.

### Sugar Market Turns Brisk

The sugar market was flat first and then higher yesterday. Traders had ample funds, and the prices of various commodities rose across the board, making sentiment brisk and increasing demand.

Car No. 4545 white refined sugar opened at 400 yuan. After opening, there were more buyers than sellers, and the buying interest of various traders became stronger, pushing the market price straight up to a high of 445 yuan. After the high, the market softened, and retail investors switched from buying to selling, causing the price to fall back again, closing at 430 yuan, a rise of 50 yuan.

Coarse sand and medium sand gradually rose, each rising by 20 yuan. The factory's snow-white and cotton-white sugars each rose by 30 yuan, and the rest were generally brisk.

### Export Tea Buying Interest Strong

Yesterday, the tea market saw a consistent rise in export boxed tea. The reasons were that the foreign exchange transfer certificate remained stable, and the authorities allowed the restoration of loans to assist exports, so sentiment became more positive, and exporters' buying interest returned. However, holders, given the high cost, insisted on selling firmly, so transactions were in negotiation and stalemate, and no significant progress was seen, but the underlying trend was unwilling to lie dormant and was rapidly soaring. As for domestic tea, the process was active and unabated due to the concentration of buying interest from this street and other places.

### Tung Oil Advances Rapidly

Although the actual sales of tung oil were still sluggish yesterday, the trend reversed and advanced wildly. The reason was that after the increase in public utility costs, the cost invisibly increased, and at the same time, various commodities began to stir. In addition, there were many other favorable buying factors, which stimulated the market and raised prices. In terms of prices, in addition to the fully measured white oil being priced as high as 750 yuan per dan, the genuine Western Hong oil also reached 650 yuan per barrel, and the rest all jumped wildly.

### Lumber Market Turns Firm

The lumber market, since the loosening of monetary policy on Saturday, has seen sentiment firm. Yesterday, there were many buyers among the industry, and lumber that had been sluggish for a long time was able to stand out. Fir strips rose by 20 cents. Pine slices opened at 1.80 yuan, rising by 35 cents. Plywood also followed suit, rising by 2 to 4 yuan. Tanhu board increased by 5 yuan, and although foreign pine remained at 3 yuan, the market was also firm.

### Since the Implementation of the Chain System, the Export Industry Has Remained Difficult to Improve

It has recently been learned from the import and export industry that since the implementation of the import and export chain system, the export business once showed a thriving trend. However, to date, this phenomenon has returned to a state of decline. The reasons for this are, first, that due to domestic conditions, transportation is difficult, and the cost of export goods has increased sharply. Second, although the price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate has gradually improved, the sales have not yet reached the ideal stage, and there is still a very large gap between its price and the actual price.

### Indian Traders Plan to Acquire Silk; China Silk Company Announces Sales Price

Silk exports have been lively for days. Recently, Indian traders have frequently inquired about prices from various dealers. China Silk Company has recently replied by telegraph, announcing prices of 1,800 rupees per load for 210 double-strand silk, 1,500 rupees per load for 140 double-strand silk, and 1,400 rupees per load for 80 double-strand silk. It is said that if an agreement can be reached, the number will reach tens of thousands of loads.

### Silk Soars

Yesterday, external funds continued to flow into rayon, and buying interest suddenly surged. There was a shortage of chips in the market, and prices were constantly being pushed up, making sentiment firm and brisk.

120 Tianqiao opened at 13,000 yuan in the morning. After opening, retail investors vigorously absorbed the supply, and the buying interest of local traders became more brisk, with prices soaring all the way to a high of 16,000 yuan. Later, news came that the yarn market had shrunk, and because sales were scarce, sentiment became volatile. With many people eager to take profits, the supply in the market increased, and the market price fell back by 500 yuan. By the close, the market had stabilized, rising by 3,000 yuan, with Dongyang Gold and Sanma following suit.

Yesterday, the export price of raw silk did not improve, and no transactions took place. Domestic goods were slightly higher due to a slight increase in finished products, and factory buying interest expanded. Rayon and cloth rose together, and sentiment was bullish. Grade D was traded at 16,500 yuan, and superior odd lots were traded at 16,000 yuan, each rising by 3,000 yuan, and the rest all followed suit.

Yesterday, the market demand for silk fabrics improved, and guest traders were active. Prices opened high in the morning, and the opening prices for bed covers were 8,900 yuan and 9,000 yuan. After opening, buying interest turned strong, and market prices went straight up. Meiya closed at 10,400 yuan, and Huaqiang closed at 10,200 yuan, both up 2,000 yuan, and the rest also rose.

### Sentiment Bullish, Holders Raise Prices; Cotton Yarn Prices Called Higher Again

Yesterday, the rise in cotton yarn prices continued. The supply of money in the market was still loose and abundant, and sentiment was consistently bullish. Holders raised prices and sold sparingly, and buyers tried their best to gather supplies, causing market prices to rise again.

42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened at a high price of 16,500 yuan. At one point, local traders took the opportunity to sell at high prices, falling to a low of 15,500 yuan, but closing at 15,800 yuan, a rise of 800 yuan compared to the weekend. Other brands, such as Baoguang and Jincheng, also rose by varying amounts from 700 yuan to 1,200 yuan.

32-count Silver Moon rose by 1,800 yuan, and 21-count Shuangma spot goods, after opening at 14,500 yuan, fell slightly to 14,000 yuan, finally closing at 14,200 yuan, a rise of 1,400 yuan.

20-count Shuangma was uniquely unable to open strongly, so it remained unchanged at the original level of 11,700 yuan. Other brands, such as Jinji and Tiannv, also rose by around 1,000 yuan, and the remaining yarns, such as 16-count and 10-count yarns, also showed strength.

The cloth market reached its peak, and new high prices appeared again for various cloths in the soaring market. Holders expressed optimism about the future and were reluctant to sell, and local buyers scrambled to gather supplies, causing the market to flourish and prices to fluctuate sharply.

At the opening, Longtou fine cloth was 480 yuan, and Four Gentlemen yuan beji was 490 yuan. Later, due to strong demand from all parties, holders strongly resisted lowering prices under the coverage of buying interest, and various cloths advanced sharply towards their peaks. Near the close, prices fell slightly due to profit-taking sales, and Longtou fine cloth closed at 525 yuan, a sharp jump of 85 yuan compared to the previous week. Four Gentlemen beji was 535 yuan, up 75 yuan. Other mid-range yuan beji also rose by around 70 yuan.

Four Gentlemen yuan zhigong set a new high of 550 yuan, and 190 high-end Shilin factory disk opened at 920 yuan. Other cloths all followed suit.

Zhong Textile Sales

Yesterday, Zhong Textile sold four types of yarn as usual, selling a total of seven or eight pieces, totaling 1,060,800 yuan, with the approved price being 9,200 yuan for 20-count Jinyuanbao (excluding unified tax), 7,400 yuan for 15-count Shuiyue, 13,000 yuan for 40-count Hongbaoguang, and 14,500 yuan for 42-count Shuanggu Honglima.

### "Lamp Runs Out of Oil" Sends a Sigh; Mr. Chen Bulei in Hangzhou

â Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng for this Newspaper

[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou, December 12] In the early autumn of 1948, Mr. Bulei came to Haining to watch the tide and visited Hangzhou along the way. At that time, I went to Haining to meet Mr. Chen. On the way from Haining to Hangzhou, he and I were in the same car, and he told me a lot about the history of Hangzhou. Mr. Bulei came to Hangzhou to study when he was in his teens. He said that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway had not yet been built at that time, and he had to follow the Gongchen Bridge Canal to Shanghai, without the wide roads and new buildings that exist today.

Memories of Hangzhou

Mr. Bulei smiled and said: "When I was studying, Jufengyuan Restaurant was the most famous. We students didn't go to Jufengyuan very often. Going to Jufengyuan was a grand feast. If the students pooled their money to feast a teacher, it would be at Jufengyuan. Now there are several famous restaurants."

Mr. Bulei also told me that he used to live in Xiaoyunzhuang when he was the director of the Zhejiang Education Department, and he missed Hangzhou very much when he left Zhejiang. One winter, he came to Hangzhou alone, to the New New Hotel, wanting a room facing the lake with plenty of light, and wrote behind closed doors. The hotel owner didn't know what Mr. Bulei was doing, and was very curious. Little did he know that this article, which shocked the whole country that year, was produced on West Lake.

Recalling Visits to the Mountains

Mr. Bulei was able to recount all the scenic spots on the lake in detail. He asked me in the car whether the Yuexia Laoren Temple (Old Man Under the Moon Temple) was still intact. One afternoon in Nanshan, I accompanied him to Baiyun Nunnery. Mr. Chen asked for a fortune slip, and everyone who went with him got a slip. When we came out, we saw a fashionable couple walking in hand in hand. I said, "This is a couple in love." Mr. Bulei smiled and said to me, "They are here to fulfill a vow." After leaving the nunnery, I returned to the nunnery and saw that red candles were burning high, and the couple was bowing together.

On the trip to Beishan, Mr. Wang Fuqing, who was traveling with us, suggested climbing and crossing the peaks to Shang Tianzhu. Many of us were worried that Mr. and Mrs. Chen would be too tired, and we wanted to hire porters for them, but Mr. Chen refused, so we climbed to Shang Tianzhu. At that time, the weather was still hot, with a temperature of about 90 degrees, but Mr. Chen didn't feel tired at all. Later, we drove to Yunqi, and Mr. Chen expressed his sympathy when he saw the students from Qilu University trudging to Hangzhou. When he came out of the main hall, he saw a student buried in his studies, looking at him for a long time, and said to me with emotion: "It's not easy to study in peace now."

A Turn for the Better

During the four days that Mr. Chen was in Hangzhou, he was always concerned about official business, and he often muttered to himself: "The work is tense, and I'm still taking a break here to visit the mountains and rivers." We all advised him to let go for a while.

I once talked to Mr. Chen about the construction of Hangzhou as an ideal cultural city, and Mr. Chen expressed his strong agreement. He said, "Hangzhou has a quiet environment where you can write." He also said to me, "News reporters need to have good interpersonal relationships, be quick-witted, and write fast. Hands, feet, and eyes all need to be fast."

After Mr. Chen returned to Shanghai, on his way to Nanjing, he sent me a letter, saying: "...This trip to Haining and Hangzhou, lingering for four days, and coming into contact with the magnificent scenery of nature, made my illness turn for the better, and I am very happy..."

The True Colors of a Scholar

As Mr. Bulei said, these four days in Hangzhou were truly spent "together from morning to night." In our time "together from morning to night," I felt that Mr. Chen was respectful to his career, loving to his friends, and especially self-sacrificing to himself. When he visited Hangzhou, he stayed in a villa on the Inner West Lake. This villa was not very famous, the palm-canopy bed and equipment were very simple, but Mr. Chen was able to sleep soundly for several nights. He didn't order any famous dishes when he ate. He could swallow anything that was brought to him. During his stay in Hangzhou, he always wore an old felt hat and a faded chestnut-colored silk coat. He was always very strict and self-possessed throughout his life, maintaining the true colors of a scholar. In the current environment, where can you find a scholar-like reader?

Sleeping in the Lakes and Mountains Forever

Mr. Chen saw Hangzhou prosper, so he especially loved Hangzhou and cared about Hangzhou. The happiness he gained in Hangzhou after visiting Hangzhou actually made his illness turn for the better. If he could be given enough time to rest in Hangzhou for a period of time, he might not have encountered this tragic change.

There are many knowledgeable people in China. He himself sacrificed himself in order to maintain the true colors of a scholar, and society neglected to pay attention. Although Mr. Chen's suicide note contained the words "the lamp has run out of oil," why did "the lamp run out of oil"? Why didn't he add some "oil" and trim the "wick" to make it return to brightness, knowing that the oil was about to run out and the lamp was about to go out?

In his will, Mr. Chen instructed that he be buried simply and lightly in the suburbs of Nanjing, but Mr. Chen's family knew that Mr. Chen loved Hangzhou very much when he was alive. He had bought mountain land with friends in Xucun in those years, and Mr. Chen intended to build a house to retire, but he never fulfilled his wish for a long time because he was unable to build a house. Now, bury him in Hangzhou, so that he can sleep forever in this landscape and rest in peace.

Mr. Chen is gone! I feel empty and unreal. The gentleman who fully represents the Chinese scholar tradition is gone! It seems that a big problem is left for us to seek a solution.

### Scenes of Tangshan, the Coal Capital of North China

â This Newspaper's War Correspondent Yang Bingsheng

[This newspaper's Tangshan 8th dispatch] With the current situation in North China, the safety of the Kailuan mining area is a concern for people across the country. Especially after the retreat from the Northeast, and with Lin Biao's troops entering the pass, Tangshan is at the forefront of North China. Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) and Tangshan form a mutually reinforcing defensive position, making it the only major military town in North China and the first point of contention in the Eastern Hebei campaign.

Your correspondent arrived in Tangshan from Beiping (Beijing) on the 5th, traveling east along the Beining Railway. The large and small stations between Beiping and Tangshan were filled with troop trains and military supplies. The constant movement of military vehicles east and west gave people a palpable sense of tension.

The express train, which normally takes only six hours to reach Tangshan from Beiping, took twelve hours due to the large number of military vehicles along the line, causing frequent stops at each station.

Stepping out of the train and into the city, the first thing that catches the eye is the "street and alley fortresses." At major intersections and busy areas, cement and stone slab bunkers, five feet above the ground, have been built.

The retreat from Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan, and the destruction of the Luan River railway bridge, have created a superficial prosperity in Tangshan. Military, government, and educational personnel, as well as refugees, from various parts of eastern Tangshan are gathering in Tangshan. Land is scarce and people are crowded, and the city's thirty-plus hotels and inns are full.

In Tangshan, more than sixty businesses opened last month. The chamber of commerce and women's associations are engaging in farcical re-elections and campaigns. In addition, the continuous production of the Kailuan mines provides the local residents with a good sedative. The current city population has exceeded 200,000, leading to the influx of floating capital from various counties in eastern Hebei and the disruption of material supplies, causing high prices.

However, this area has a unique advantage bestowed by God: low coal prices, resulting in ample power supply. Looking deeper into Tangshan society, Jiaotong University has already moved south, Qixin Cement Company is about to be forced to shut down, Kailuan coal cannot be transported out, and inventory is increasing. The tragic plight of the poor and refugees, the westward migration of wealthy merchants, and the fear of an impending storm, constantly worrying about the safety of the Tianjin-Tangshan road, all combine to form the bright and dark sides of Tangshan society.

To defend Tangshan and leverage the power of total war, in addition to the thorough deployments made by the North China military authorities in response to the current situation in eastern Hebei, the local military has stipulated several emergency measures for wartime: (1) Residents who do not need to live in the urban area may voluntarily evacuate; (2) Citizens should store water and purchase at least half a month's worth of food; (3) Everyone must cooperate with the military and strictly abide by martial law; (4) Regulations on curfews, alarms for bandits, and combat alert signals.
