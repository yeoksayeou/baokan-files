After Cheng Qian and Li Zongren arrived in Beijing one after another on the afternoon of the 23rd, they immediately made statements about participating in the vice-presidential election. Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, also made an informal statement on the morning of the 23rd, announcing his participation in the vice-presidential election. The reporter visited Mr. Yu and asked whether the National Assembly should amend the constitution. Mr. Yu said: The biggest task of this National Assembly should be to complete the election. The issue of amending the constitution should be studied at length. The constitution is still in its early stages of implementation and should not be amended hastily. If there are those who want to amend it, then the amendment will be discussed and revised item by item, which will take more than two months. Therefore, I believe that if there is a need to amend the constitution, a temporary National Assembly can be convened for this purpose within these six years. The reporter further inquired about his views on the constitution. Mr. Yu said: To study it in detail, there are still areas for consideration in the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the overseas Chinese elections. The reporter asked Mr. Yu if he would be interested in concurrently serving as the current President of the Control Yuan after running for Vice President. Mr. Yu said: The President of the Control Yuan should no longer hold concurrent public office? I am participating in the Vice President election, regardless of success or failure, but I hope that the personnel of the Control Yuan can be changed to a new situation and develop a new style.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Yu Youren has decided to participate in the vice-presidential election. When Mr. Yu went to the National Assembly registration office on the 23rd, a reporter asked, "Have you decided to run for Vice President?" He replied, "I have decided." The reporter then asked him to state his motivation for running. Mr. Yu said in a firm tone: "My participation in the election is based on my long-standing aspiration to assist the Premier and the President for more than 40 years, to seek the realization of a constitution, and to create a Republic of China that is of the people, by the people, and for the people." The reporter asked, "Will you wait for the nomination of the Kuomintang Central Committee?" Mr. Yu replied, "Of course." The reporter further asked, "Have you resigned from being a member of the Control Yuan?" He replied, "I resigned a long time ago." Finally, the reporter asked, "Will you host a reception for the press?" He said, "I am preparing the invitations."

The Founding Father advocated the revolution with the Three Principles of the People, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, and established the Republic of China. The President inherited the legacy of the Premier, led the victory of the War of Resistance, and completed nationalism. This constitutional government is now being implemented, which can complete democracy. He believes that people's livelihood will be completed in the future. Regarding the issue of Vice President, Cheng Qian said that he should urge his friends to participate in the election, because he is a member of the Kuomintang and the party has its party platform and policies, and the Premier has left a good ideology. His political views and actions should be in accordance with the decision of the party. Cheng Qian mentioned the situation in the Wuhan Headquarters jurisdiction, saying that it was generally very good, and the bandits on the Pinghan Line have been defeated. Fang Juehui, Xia Douyin, and others came to Beijing on the same ship with Cheng Qian to attend the National Assembly.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] Shi Kuiling, a member of the National Economic Conference and director of the Tianjin Gold Control Bureau, flew from Beiping to Shanghai on the 22nd, and arrived in Beijing by train on the 23rd. In Tianjin, in addition to handling the work of the Gold Control Bureau, Shi also investigated the economic situation in the north on behalf of the National Economic Conference. Over the past month, Shi contacted more than 30 units. The results of his investigation have been drafted into a report, including a total of 24 items, including food, transportation, finance, diverting idle funds, and encouraging withdrawals, which will be provided to the government for reference. Shi is scheduled to visit President Zhang in the next few days to report on everything and will attend the National Economic Conference on the 25th. According to Shi, the economic situation in Beiping and Tianjin was still stable two months ago, but later, due to the rise in prices in Shanghai and the influx of idle funds from the Northeast, it also fluctuated. According to his investigation, if the government can take effective countermeasures and accommodate all parties' opinions, it can still improve the entire economic situation in the north. Regarding the idle funds in the Northeast, Shi believes that because the Northeast only has exchanges with Beiping and Tianjin, a large amount of idle funds are concentrated in Beiping and Tianjin. If the Northeast can exchange with other places, the idle funds will also disperse.

Decision to Allocate a Large Number of Armored Vehicles to Strengthen Defense

[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 23rd] Du Zhenyuan, director of the Guangdong Railway Bureau, came to Guangzhou to visit Chairman Song to discuss the security issues along the railway line, and the result was satisfactory. Du said that Chairman Song has agreed to increase the number of national army troops and allocate a large number of armored vehicles to strengthen the defense. At present, two armored patrol vehicles have been dispatched, which has been quite effective. He also said that the US aid allocated to the railway this time is about 30 million US dollars, but to improve the railway and restore it to its pre-war state, at least 12,000 tons of steel beams, 1 million sleepers, 540 kilometers of steel rails, 1,000 freight cars, and 100 passenger cars are needed. In addition to the 50 locomotives ordered from Australia six months ago, which also need to be paid, a machinery factory must also be established. Therefore, more than 30 million is not enough to cover the preliminary calculations.

### Merger of Aid to China Proposals: U.S. House of Representatives Begins Debate; $100 Million Grant Portion for Self-Defined Use

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The U.S. House Rules Committee announced today that the House of Representatives will begin a comprehensive three-day debate on the combined foreign aid bill, including economic and military aid to China, on the 23rd. The House Foreign Affairs Committee submitted a 100-page report on the foreign aid bill to the meeting today, emphasizing that the situation in China, whether economically or militarily, is similar to that of hope. The report also pointed out that measures to withhold aid in order to achieve reform in China first have been tried, but this has only produced adverse effects. Currently, there is a certain force within China, supported and directed by foreign countries, which is about to engulf all of China. If we do not provide aid to China, then China may become a vassal state of the Soviet Union, or the civil war will continue to drag on.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The aid to China bill is divided into two parts: the first authorizes an appropriation of $363 million to China, the use of which must be in accordance with the applicable provisions of the European Recovery Program. The execution of this economic aid to China will also be the responsibility of the administrator of the European Recovery Program; the second, the grant portion to China is up to $100 million, which China can use as it deems necessary, thereby allowing China to decide on its own to use this fund for military purposes. Since the Foreign Affairs Committee has made this $100 million a grant portion, allowing China to determine its own use, it technically avoids mixing military and economic aid in one case. After debates in the full sessions of the House and Senate, the aid to China bill will be submitted to a joint conference of the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses to resolve the differences. It will then become the most final bill to be sent to the President for signature. The bill also stipulates that before Congress approves the appropriation, the Reconstruction Bank will advance $50 million to begin the implementation of the aid to China program. Vandenberg told reporters that the general objectives of the European Recovery Program, applicable to the aid to China program, will be included in the agreement established by both parties. This will stipulate certain matters such as self-help and oversight of usage. Vandenberg continued that the scope and limitations of the European Recovery Program Act also apply to China. The period for the European Recovery Program Act is four years, while that for aid to China is one year. After the expiration, any aid to China must be carried out by new legislation. The $100 million grant portion to China will assist the Chinese government in purchasing military supplies, and can also help in the transfer of surplus U.S. military supplies and materials to China, as long as the Chinese government intends to do so.

Furthermore, on the evening of the 22nd, Communist bandits in northern Shanxi also launched fierce attacks on Yongjiabao and other places west and east of Tianzhen.

[This newspaper, Gui Sui, 22nd] A spokesman for the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Gui Sui announced on the 22nd: (1) In order to firmly defend Datong, the National Army in Yanbei voluntarily withdrew the defending troops from Zuoyun and Huairen on the 21st.

### Wei Lihuang Discusses the War Situation; Northeast Prospects Remain Optimistic; Military Success or Failure Depends on Human Factors

[This newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The official recapture of Liaoyang by the National Army has been fully confirmed by relevant sources here.

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 23rd] Wei Lihuang, speaking about the war situation, said: Although the bandits claim to have eleven columns, none of them are complete. As long as we seize the opportunity and wipe out two or three of their columns, we can defeat them all and fully recover the Northeast. The number of troops is not the only factor in military affairs; success or failure depends on human factors. Are the military operations effective? Is the coordination effective? He said: The strength of the National Army in the Northeast is not weak. Wei cited historical examples from China and abroad: Cao Cao's defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs, Fu Jian's rout at the Fei River, and the Allied defeat at the Battle of Tannenberg in World War I, all of which achieved victory with fewer troops against many. Wei continued: Although the situation is difficult, the prospects remain optimistic. The National Army is buying time, and is fully prepared in terms of morale and material, so as to be invincible. The Communist bandits are accustomed to "big eats small," and if we also "big eats small," we will not be harmed to this day. He finally emphasized the importance of Northeast industry, saying: China's revival must begin in the Northeast.

Editorial

### Relief Special Levy After Principles Established

The Shanghai District's fundraising for the relief special levy has had its principles determined at the third meeting. According to Mayor Wu's announcement, the main points are: (1) The target of the fundraising has been changed to great philanthropists, which is different from the original idea of issuing national crisis wealth, victory wealth, and bandit suppression wealth; (2) Everything will be handled in a coordinated manner, and there will be no rigid regulations on the amount of donations in various areas of the district; (3) The list of donors will also be drafted by the various areas themselves. Finance Minister Yu also stated: (1) There are no plans to impose rigid regulations on the amount, and it may be allocated by the various trade associations; (2) The names of the donors, if they do not wish to be published, should have their opinions respected and not be published; (3) Those who are stingy will not be forced, but it is hoped that they will be subject to public and moral condemnation. In this light, this relief special levy has truly become a special levy in name and in fact. It is not a tax, but a voluntary donation, not a compulsory allocation. Compared to the original idea of levying a one-time property tax, it is inevitably too far off-topic and feels like it exists in name only. However, in terms of the matter itself, the principles now being formulated can be said to be the most reasonable.

Because property tax was the original name proposed, it has undergone many modifications, such as temporary property tax, temporary special property tax, temporary property donation, property special donation, national construction donation, national construction special donation, etc., all of which have a very strong fiscal connotation, and the technology is not a little careless. Now that it is officially named the relief special levy, it has marked its special nature; in the second article of its measures, it is clearly stipulated that it is to be used for conducting relief work to aid refugees, and the responsible authorities have repeatedly stated that all the funds donated will be used entirely for relief and will not be diverted to military or political expenses: then, its nature and purpose are entirely charitable, compared with the usual water, drought, and winter relief donations, the scope is only particularly enlarged, and the central government and various local governments are only particularly solemn about it.

Since it is the same kind of donation, why should the scope be particularly enlarged this time? And why should all parties be particularly solemn about it? The reason is very clear. That is, after the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, which left scars everywhere, coupled with the rampant Communist bandits, who poisoned everywhere, burning, killing, and looting, the tragedy was extreme, so that all compatriots in the bandit areas, regardless of men, women, old, young, rich, poor, wise, or foolish, had no choice but to leave their homes and flee, to temporarily avoid their fierce flames and evil hands. Therefore, today there are particularly many refugees, and relief is particularly urgent, so the funds needed for relief are also particularly large. Furthermore, after the National Army recovered various areas, after the Communist bandits deliberately destroyed them, not only were nine out of ten houses empty and without food or clothing, but also production tools such as seeds and plowing cattle had been destroyed and plundered, leaving nothing. Under such circumstances of poverty and starvation, if a large amount of materials are not quickly transported and distributed for relief, what hope can there be for the survivors of the disaster? And how can all the production enterprises in such a vast area be restored? Is Shanghai not currently experiencing a raw material shortage? Although prices continue to rise, the actual sales are limited, and the purchasing power of the interior is extremely weak. If this phenomenon continues to deepen and cannot be actively restored, how can the raw materials and fuels needed by the industrial and commercial sectors be obtained from overseas? And how can the stockpiled manufactured goods rely solely on speculative hoarding as the only outlet? Therefore, the significance of carrying out relief and aid is not only passive, but also active: its nature is not only charitable, but also economic. If the focus is on providing disaster relief in areas such as Beijing and Shanghai, where refugees are gathering, in order to temporarily alleviate their hunger and cold, we believe that this is still only seeing one side of the problem.

Finance Minister Yu believes that the donation may be allocated by the various trade associations. Although the word "allocation" sounds very harsh, helping others is helping oneself. From the perspective of shared destiny and the lack of boundaries in the economy, we do hope that people in various regions will voluntarily and enthusiastically donate to revive the vitality of the disaster areas, which is to save the economic decline. As for those wealthy families, high officials, and dignitaries, although the authorities strongly advocate leniency and do not want to force them too much or hinder people from doing good, social atmosphere values leadership, and the disparity between the rich and the poor harbors crisis, and we even more eagerly hope that they will take the lead in donating and jointly support this good cause, not letting the ancient Bu Shi and Xian Gao monopolize the glory.

There is also one point that must be pointed out to the authorities, that is, providing relief and aid in accordance with reason has countless aspects, and cannot be accomplished in a moment. Disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and it cannot afford to delay or circle around. Therefore, although the relief funds are still in the process of being raised today, all preparations must be designed in advance to achieve rapid success. In addition to funding and personnel, all aspects such as regions, targets, materials, transportation, etc., should be planned in a coordinated manner and prepared systematically. It is not appropriate to waste any of the general expectations of the philanthropists, nor is it appropriate to be too trivial, resulting in the old formula of just adding a little embellishment. Because this fundraising has a large scope, the task is also increased accordingly. We remember that on the 5th of this month, when the Relief Special Levy Supervision Committee was formally established in the Executive Yuan, it made a decision to only allow success and not failure. We believe that this decision should be applied not only to the fundraising of the special levy, but also to the conduct of relief work.

### Li Zongren's Speech in Nanjing

(Above, according to page one) Mr. Li Zongren said: Some candidates for vice president seem to be divided into civil and military positions or southern and northern people. I am a soldier, and I am very concerned about politics on weekdays, and I am also very close to civil officials, so there is no difference between civil and military. Although I am a southerner, I get along very well with northerners, so there is no regional distinction. In terms of international relations, I get along very well with friends from the United States and the Soviet Union. Li explained his reason for announcing his candidacy for vice president at the earliest time: to promote a democratic political atmosphere. Regarding the nomination of candidates, Li believes that in terms of democratic principles, free elections should be the top priority. When reporters asked Li who Li's formidable opponent was in the election, Li smiled and said: There is no so-called formidable opponent, and he is happy that the election is like playing basketball. There are senior old predecessors participating in the election, and I admire them very much. When reporters asked what he would do to assist the President in handling government affairs if he were elected Vice President, Li said that military affairs were the most important issue in the near future. This bandit suppression work will take three to five years in the short term and ten to eight years in the long term. I usually pay close attention to politics and will contribute my personal experience to the future new government. Li also emphasized his confidence in assisting the new government in completing bandit suppression. Regarding the economic issue, Li believes that in the face of a serious economic crisis, if someone contributes money and those with strength contribute their strength, there will be no problem. The United States is helping us because there is an urgent need, especially military assistance, because we are using military force to protect the people. We welcome the assistance of friendly nations, but self-help is blessed by God. We should still be self-reliant and rely on ourselves. Regarding the situation in the Northeast, Li said: The National Army is at a disadvantage in the Northeast. The Communist bandits are using a policy of violence to control a wide area. We only hold a few major strongholds in the Northeast and urgently need reinforcements to expand. As for North China, the National Army still occupies an advantage, with a large area. It is normal for Communist bandits to raid, but there should be no problem. Finally, Li said in a humorous tone: After he is elected President and takes office, the first measure will be gender equality and the promotion of women's rights.

### Farewell Reception Before Leaving Shanghai

[Reported by this newspaper] Li Zongren left Shanghai for Nanjing by the original plane at 3:40 p.m. yesterday with Secretary-General Xiao Yishan, Chief of Staff Wang Hongshao, Office Director Li Yang, and more than ten staff members. Yesterday afternoon, Li held a banquet on the 14th floor of the International Hotel, hosting the heads of the city's party, government, and military agencies and leaders from all walks of life. Those present included Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Yan Huiqing, Du Yuesheng, Xu Rongqing, Huang Shaohong, Fang Ye, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Xiluo, and hundreds of others. Li delivered a speech first, stating that in view of the current situation, it is necessary to thoroughly reform politics to regain public support and win the assistance of friendly nations. Speaker Pan said in his speech that the citizens of Shanghai are willing to do their utmost to support the suppression of bandits, but hope that the government will thoroughly reform and eliminate the phenomenon of extreme disparity between the rich and the poor in society, and hope that Director Li will convey the opinions of the citizens of Shanghai to the central government from an objective standpoint. Mayor Wu said: The current government is determined to renew itself with the people and has indeed moved in a changing direction. The delegates to the National Assembly all come from the people, which is a new phenomenon, and a dawn has appeared for the future of the entire country. Yuan Xiluo and Fang Zhi also delivered speeches one after another. The grand meeting did not end until after one o'clock.

### National Assembly Delegate Zhu Ping Proposes "Three Policies to Save the Nation"

[Reported by this newspaper] National Assembly Delegate Zhu Ping (Director of the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau) has drafted "Three Policies to Save the Nation" and a plan for the comprehensive implementation of agricultural land reform. He will exchange opinions with various delegates and parties when he goes to Nanjing to attend the National Assembly, and then make recommendations to the government. The content is roughly as follows: A. Economic Reform: The core issue of China's current economy is "how to balance the budget." Considering that extraordinary measures must be taken to balance the budget during this period of mobilization to suppress the rebellion, military expenditures should be separated from the general budget so that the general budget is not affected by military expenses. The following economic instructions must be implemented simultaneously: (1) Establish domestic currency; (2) All foreign trade should be state-run, and a barter system should be adopted as much as possible; (3) Implement agricultural land reform; (4) Gradually adopt a planned economic system to promote industrial development.

B. Military Reform: (1) Adopt an elite force strategy to reduce the number and improve the quality; (2) The main line of defense should be built on the economy; (3) Use elite troops to firmly defend points and lines, resist enemy attacks, and at the same time organize mobile elite units to be placed at several important transportation points, so as to attack the enemy's main force at any time and assist the attacked areas; (4) Obtain military supplies from friendly nations through loans; (5) Obtain military pay from a small number of wealthy households through secret donations, so as to avoid the continued unlimited expansion of currency due to raising military expenses; (6) Military rations should only be borrowed from a small number of large households, and should not generally increase the burden on ordinary people; (7) Conscription should focus on military training and organize the masses locally for training to enhance self-defense capabilities. C. Political Reform: (1) Improve the treatment of civil servants while protecting their positions; (2) Employ new talents; (3) Strictly implement the constitutional provision that "military personnel shall not hold civil positions"; (4) In the past, politics focused on the central government and provinces, while neglecting counties and townships, which was abandoning the essential for the superficial and reversing priorities. In the future, a "talent returning to the hometown" movement should be promoted to bring the most outstanding talents back to the most grassroots level.

According to Mr. Hu's statement, after arriving in Tokyo, he visited the responsible persons of relevant agencies such as our delegation in Japan to strengthen communication and seek to accelerate the transportation of Japanese compensation materials. The first batch of compensation materials will be shipped by the end of April, but the second batch of 150,000 tons will have to wait for a lottery to decide. As for the business licenses for the Tokyo branch, Yokohama office, and Kobe office of the China Merchants Bureau, they have been issued by MacArthur's headquarters, but the official commencement of business still needs to wait. Currently, the focus of the China Merchants Bureau's work is to transport Japanese compensation materials to China and the barter materials transported to Japan by the Central Trust of China.

In addition to 1.3 million tons of ships maintaining domestic transportation, the remaining 300,000 tons can be used for foreign expansion. All Japanese ships are uniformly managed and controlled by the government, and their crews are also requisitioned, so they are easy to command, and work efficiency is also good. Japan's shipbuilding plan is estimated at 300,000 tons per year. Its exports were mainly cement a month ago, and the target markets were Southeast Asia and Manila, followed by steel plates, coal, and hardware.

Currently, the price of paper in Jinan is approaching 10 million per ream, and it is difficult to purchase, which has forced five newspapers to temporarily suspend publication, and the ten that are still published are struggling to survive. They requested that the amount of paper allocated to Jinan be increased to 80 tons, and that a batch be allocated first to maintain the status quo. The leaders expressed sympathy and ordered the relevant departments to actively find ways to increase the quota and discuss current maintenance methods. The petition delegation will go to Shanghai within a few days to negotiate with the Quota Allocation Office of the Transportation and Management Committee.

Furthermore, Wang Jifang, the former supervisor of the Anhui regional bureau, was ambushed by communist bandits in Xingliuzhen while supervising taxation with Zhu Weiyang, the former director of the Funan branch, and was captured at the same time, but later escaped by taking advantage of the opportunity. Recently, Wu Rongchun, the director of the Yingkou branch in the northeast, and his staff were also captured. Furthermore, after the National Army recaptured Yongji and Siping, Lin Qicang, the director of the Yongji branch, Zhao Huilin, the director of the Siping branch, and most of the staff members of the two bureaus have disappeared. Zhao Houfeng, the director of the Liaoyang branch, only led a small number of staff members to escape in disguise when Liaoyang fell. Zhang Baijie, the assistant of the branch, has been captured, and most of the staff members and their families have not yet escaped. In addition, many staff members of the Rehe Chaoyang branch, the Henan Xuchang and Nanyang branches, the Anhui Funan and Liu'an branches, the Northeast Chenan branch, and the county offices of each branch have disappeared, been captured, or injured, totaling more than 70 cases and more than 300 people. The Ministry of Finance is extremely concerned about these tax officials who adhere to their posts and are loyal and unswerving, and has ordered tax agencies in various places to investigate their whereabouts nearby, try to rescue them, and provide condolences and relief to their families.

### US Considers Handing Over Large Quantities of Military Supplies to National Army in North China; Chennault Criticizes US Policy Errors

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Congressional figures said that in addition to military aid to China in cash, they also intend to state that they require the United States to continue to handle any possible remaining military equipment and munitions for Chairman Chiang. It is reported that a proposal to airlift large quantities of surplus munitions from Hawaii and Okinawa to the Chinese government's troops in North China may have been under consideration, as the Chinese troops, although equipped with American equipment, lack munitions.

[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] The 19 newspapers of the Scripps-Howard system are now beginning to publish an article by Chennault describing the "Inside Story of American Policy Toward China."

Smason said that several other "national" programs have been approved by the mission and the American Relief Materials Handling Committee of the Executive Yuan.

The Chinese government and the Guangdong provincial government also contributed an equal amount of rice. Jilock, head of the Chinese Relief Mission, is scheduled to come to Guangzhou at the end of this week to inspect the embankment project.

### Southern Kingdom Asks for Gorizia in Exchange for Trieste Port; Italy Resolutely Refuses; US and Soviet Union Will Strive for the Hong Kong Issue

[United Press, Yugoslav Capital, 23rd] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Semic said at a press conference yesterday that the Yugoslav government is prepared to resolve the Trieste issue through mutual consultation, even at the cost of returning the Trieste port to Italy, provided that Gorizia to its north is assigned to Yugoslavia. Previously, the Yugoslav government announced that it had lodged a strong protest with the United States, Britain, and France, opposing the manner in which the countries proposed to return the Trieste port to Italy, but the note did not state acceptance or rejection. Semic said that the Yugoslav government is prepared to negotiate with the current Italian government led by Gasperi.

[United Press, Rome, 23rd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that Italy resolutely refuses Yugoslavia's proposal to exchange Gorizia for Trieste. "Italy cannot cut off a piece of its own flesh to exchange for another piece of its own flesh."

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] US diplomatic authorities today rejected Yugoslavia's proposal to cede Gorizia to Yugoslavia as a condition for returning Trieste to Italy. According to State Department officials, Trieste originally did not belong to Yugoslavia, and its return to Italy is not something Yugoslavia can use to bargain for. The opinions of the Yugoslav government are not of much concern to the United States, Britain, and France. When the three Western powers proposed returning the Trieste port to Italy last Saturday, they notified the Soviet Union and Italy, the two countries concerned, by formal note, and sent a copy of the note to Yugoslavia for reference only, out of consideration for diplomatic etiquette. Yugoslavia has nothing to do with the agreement to designate the Trieste port as an international free zone. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister's proposal to exchange the Trieste port for Gorizia is the same as that rejected by the Italian cabinet in 1946. The three Western powers will reject both Yugoslavia's formal protest and the exchange proposal.

[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] Observers here commented on the Anglo-American-French proposal to return the Trieste port to Italy, saying that the Soviet Union will not easily give up the right to speak in the administrative bodies of Trieste that it obtained through the United Nations. The Soviet Union has repeatedly urged the speedy appointment of a governor of the Trieste port. The Soviet Union's policy is aimed at supporting the United Nations, not at reducing the responsibilities of the United Nations.

### South Patrol Troops Cross Border and Cause Trouble; Situation in Trieste Suddenly Tenses; British and American Zone Border Defense Forces Strengthened

[United Press, Trieste, 22nd] According to an announcement by the Allied Military Government: Yugoslav patrol troops intruded into the British and American zone of the Free Territory of Trieste on the 22nd and engaged in a machine gun battle with police, seriously injuring one officer. A Yugoslav patrol troop crossed the southern border and intruded into Traga in the British and American zone and, "without warning," fired a machine gun at a civilian police officer. The officer returned fire, and the Southern troops fled back. It is unknown whether they were hit. Earlier, the military government authorities had declared that police on the border between this area, the Free Territory of Trieste, and Yugoslavia had engaged in a gunfight with Yugoslav people, so it is currently unclear whether the Southern patrol troop was involved or if this was a separate incident. After Britain, the United States, and France suggested that Trieste be returned to Italy, the Yugoslav-Trieste border became extremely tense. The most important people's organization in Trieste, the Trieste Regional Committee, has telegraphed Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the United Nations Security Council, requesting approval of the proposal to return Trieste and organizing a delegation to visit British Commander Airey, who is in charge of the British and American occupied zones, asking him to convey the gratitude of the people of Trieste to the Allied governments. There is no unrest in the city of Trieste, but the Italian people are celebrating wildly everywhere, with some taking spontaneous holidays and not working.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Rome Radio reports that the British and American troops in the Free Territory of Trieste, adjacent to the Free Territory of Istria, have been ordered to remain in their camps since midnight on the 21st and are not allowed to leave. At the same time, the defense forces along the southern border of the Free Territory have been strengthened.

### Italy Holds No Extravagant Hopes for Recovering Former Territories

[Associated Press, Rome, 23rd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman declared today that although the United States, Britain, and France have proposed amending the peace treaty to return Trieste to Italy, Italy does not hope to recover its former territories. This is because Britain strongly opposes this matter, making it difficult to reach an agreement with the United States and France. France is very willing to return Eritrea, Somaliland, and Libya to Italy, and the United States and the Soviet Union have no objections, but Britain's attitude is ambiguous.

### U.S. House Passes Interim Aid for France, Italy, and Austria

The Appropriations Committee pointed out that the $522 million in winter relief funds will be exhausted by March 25, and if additional aid is not provided, the three countries will be unable to survive the transitional period before the implementation of the Marshall Plan.

### French Foreign Minister Bidault Departs Italy for Paris

Italian Prime Minister Gasperi and his wife, as well as Vice Minister Baluscia, welcomed them there, and crowds cheered them. Bidault then spoke with Gasperi in the sanctuary's reception room for an hour, reportedly discussing issues related to the Christian Social parties of France and Italy.

[Associated Press, Rome, 23rd] Prime Minister Gasperi and Foreign Minister Sforza returned to Rome together today. Crowds at the station and along the way shouted slogans such as "Long live Trieste," "Long live Gasperi and Sforza." Gasperi said to the crowd, "We still do not know what the future holds. We must still wait. We must approach this with great patience. Nothing can be achieved without effort. Effort should transcend party lines."

### U.S. Fleet in the Mediterranean Does Not Carry Atomic Bombs, U.S. Navy Authority Issues Statement

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Naval authorities stated today that Republican Congressman Miller's claim that most of the U.S. fleet had been transferred to the Mediterranean, and that several ships were carrying atomic bombs, must be based on misinformation. Miller claimed yesterday that if Yugoslavia attacked Trieste or northern Italy, or if the Soviet Union tried to expel us from Germany, we would see atomic bombs fall within 48 hours. Most U.S. aircraft carriers are currently stationed in the Mediterranean, and several battleships are near Trieste, controlling the situation there. Naval authorities corrected this, stating that the United States only has fourteen warships stationed in the Mediterranean, namely, the aircraft carrier "Philippine Sea," three cruisers, and ten destroyers. None of them are equipped with atomic bombs.

[This Newspaper] London, 23rd Broadcast: Paris News, this afternoon, the spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry completely denied the rumors that the French Foreign Minister will go to Washington next month to participate in the Three-Power Conference.

### Soviet Union Boycotts Berlin Allied Control Council, U.S., Britain, and France Urge Soviet Union to Clarify Attitude

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] The British, American, and French military governments have demanded that the Soviet government immediately clarify the meaning of the Soviet Union's announcement that the Berlin Allied Control Council will not hold regular extended meetings. Allied military government officials specifically pointed out that the three powers issued a note to the Soviet Union "demanding" rather than "requesting." Today, the Soviet secretarial staff of the Allied Control Council went to work as usual, but did not hold a meeting. An Allied spokesperson said that the situation is currently very uncertain, and the Soviet Union should soon make a definitive statement as to whether the Berlin Four-Power Control Agency will continue or will end. It is also learned that American officials of the Berlin Four-Power Military Government are reviewing the possibility of making the American zone of Berlin a close-knit unit after the Soviet Union withdraws from the military government. According to sources, the note from the British, American, and French military governments to the Soviet military government includes the following demands: (1) The Soviet Union should immediately clarify the meaning of its actions; (2) Whether the Soviet Union is willing for the Allied Control Council to continue its mission; (3) If the Soviet Union intends to end the Allied Control Council, what kind of agency does it intend to replace it with; (4) The Soviet Union should know that the establishment of the Four-Power Control Council was determined by the Potsdam Agreement, and the Western powers participated based on their rights, so any alternative agency should also have the participation of the Western powers. This note can be jointly issued by the United States, Britain, and France. According to Berlin newspapers, six former German staff officers and two former senior members of the German Youth League have drafted a complete plan for the establishment of an independent government in East Germany in the past three months.

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Since Marshal Sokolovsky withdrew from the Four-Power Allied Control Council meeting seat, the activities of the Berlin Special Control Mechanism have entered their third day. A senior Soviet official stated that it has not yet been decided whether the Soviet Union will definitely withdraw its Four-Power representatives from the Allied Control Council. Currently, due to "heavy workload," Soviet officials are unable to attend the Allied Control Council. Although this indicates that the Soviet Union has not definitely withdrawn from the control mechanism, there is no indication that the Soviet authorities are prepared to restore Four-Power cooperation. At the same time, due to the unclear situation, various rumors have arisen. One rumor is that Marshal Sokolovsky has flown back to Moscow for instructions, and another rumor is that the families of Allied personnel have been evacuated from Berlin. The former has not yet been confirmed, and the latter has been denied by the relevant parties. Currently, propaganda attacks from both sides have been fully launched in Berlin's eighteen newspapers and radio stations.

### Papanek States in Security Council that Czechoslovakia Was Oppressed by the Soviet Union; Requests that Beneš Be Invited to Testify

[Reuters, Lake Success, 22nd] The Security Council today voted nine to two to allow former Czechoslovakian representative to the United Nations, Papanek, to participate in the Security Council's discussion on the situation in Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union and Ukraine voted against. Papanek then took his seat amidst applause. Papanek reported to the Security Council that the Soviet Union and the Communist Party had begun to undermine Czech democracy before the end of the war, and that every action of the Communist Party was aimed at destroying Czech democratic life and making Czechoslovakia completely diplomatically submissive to the Soviet Union.

Papanek cited the following examples: (1) After liberation, the Czech government delegation was prevented by Soviet troops from contacting the Carpathian Russians; (2) When Beneš led advisors to Moscow in 1945, the Communist Party forced the government to give important positions to Communists; (3) In the economic field, the Soviet Union has taken over Czech oil mines; (4) Last July, the Soviet Union forced Czechoslovakia to withdraw from the Marshall Plan. Beneš personally told him that when he went to Moscow in 1945, he was at one point prevented from communicating with the outside world by Soviet troops. At that time, Foreign Minister Masaryk was in San Francisco, and Molotov repeatedly threatened him, telling him that if he did not adopt the same policies as the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union would sever relations with Czechoslovakia. Papanek further said that President Beneš has lost his freedom, and if he had freedom, he would have resigned. Papanek asked the Security Council to invite Beneš to the United Nations to prove that he was forced to accept Gottwald's dictatorship. The success of the Czech communist coup will encourage communist forces around the world, especially in Europe, and will result in riots and conflicts, so it cannot be regarded as merely an internal affair. Papanek also said that the armed militias in the streets of Prague during the coup included Soviet spies, and witnesses to these facts are now in London and Germany and have telegraphed that they are willing to testify before the Security Council.

### Communist Tide Must Be Checked, Cadogan Warns

[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] Britain today warned the United Nations that the spread of communism must be stopped, even if it means resorting to war. British representative Cadogan told the Security Council, "There must be a limit to this communist tide, and it must be stopped when this limit is exceeded." Cadogan made an unprecedentedly harsh indictment of the Soviet Union in the Security Council, saying, "The British know that the Soviet Union is preparing to help the Communist Party seize power in Italy." He pointed out that the recent coup in Czechoslovakia, compared with previous coups in the Balkan countries, shows that this is a Soviet "old trick." Cadogan quoted a report from the new Czech Minister of Foreign Trade as saying, "We must thank our Slavic allies, especially the Soviet Union, for making it possible for us to defeat the reactionaries." This is enough to prove Soviet interference. Cadogan also agreed with Papanek that the reason for the Czech Communist Party's crackdown was the deep fear of being defeated in the May elections. Cadogan then mentioned the upcoming Italian elections, saying that the British know that a plan to assist the Italian Communist Party in carrying out a similar change to Czechoslovakia is already prepared. In the past few weeks, Yugoslavia has sent arms to the Italian Communist Party, and he said that these arms have been seized by the Italian government several times. In front of a nervous audience, Papanek directly pointed out that the Soviet Union's strategy is the same as that of Nazi Germany. He pointed out that the strategists in the Kremlin were already planning the coup in Czechoslovakia before the end of World War II. He said that Czech President Beneš is actually a prisoner of the communist government, and he strongly stated that former Foreign Minister Masaryk was definitely not a suicide.

### Czech General Election to Be Held in May, Two Important Figures Arrested

They were waiting for a foreign plane at the aviation club airport, planning to have a foreign diplomat secretly take them on board.

When Slamecka and others were arrested, they were carrying a large amount of foreign currency.

The chief representative of the Finnish delegation, Foreign Minister Enckell, said, "We believe that based on mutual goodwill, these negotiations can be successful. We will do our best to achieve this supreme goal."

### Three U.S. Military and Political Leaders Unanimously Advocate That the U.S. Must Enforce Conscription; Marshall and Others Conclude While Testifying Before the Military Service Committee

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal told members of the Senate Military Service Committee on the 22nd that it is absolutely necessary to quickly pass the conscription and universal military training law. The two cabinet secretaries made these remarks while attending a closed-door meeting convened by the Senate Military Service Committee, which is currently reviewing this preparatory measure proposed by Truman. Secretary of the Army Royal also attended the meeting.

Senator Gurney, Republican Chairman of the South Dakota Senate Military Service Committee, later told reporters that the closed-door meeting discussed the general emergency and the increasingly serious situation in Europe. The unanimous conclusion of Marshall, Forrestal, and Royal was that it is absolutely necessary to implement compulsory conscription and universal military training laws. He continued, saying that he firmly believes that all ten members of the committee who attended the meeting agreed after the meeting that it is absolutely necessary to quickly pass the two measures. Before the closed-door meeting, the committee heard the opinions of retired Supreme Court Justice Roberts and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Compton, who strongly urged the passage of the universal training bill. Gurney denied that any new agreements or secret information was revealed during the closed-door meeting regarding the world situation, saying that Marshall did not indicate the extent of the danger of the world situation, nor did he consider what steps to take.

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Senate Military Service Committee members said on the 23rd that Secretary of State Marshall refused to draw a line, beyond which, if the Soviet Union expanded, war would occur. Committee members asked Marshall on the 22nd whether the United States had decided on the scope of Soviet aggression that it could tolerate without considering war, and Marshall told them that no war line had been drawn.

### Menon Discusses Indian Foreign Policy in Nanjing

Striving to Reduce Tensions Between the Two Major Blocs

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] United Nations Korean Committee Chairman and Indian Ambassador Menon, who returned to Nanjing from Korea, will soon return to India to take office as Deputy Foreign Minister. Menon received a reporter from the Central News Agency alone on the 23rd and discussed Indian foreign policy at length. It is said that India's foreign policy, as marked by Prime Minister Nehru, follows two principles: (1) India avoids belonging to any power bloc, and further strives to reduce the tensions between the two major blocs in the world. (2) For Asian countries that intend to become independent, India is willing to provide any possible assistance. The economic situation of some Asian countries is progressing from a colonial status to a national economic status, and India will do its best to promote this progress.

### News Freedom Conference Opens Yesterday; Philippine Representative Elected Chairman; United Nations Under-Secretary-General Koh Heng Attends and Delivers Speech

[Special Dispatch from Geneva, March 23, from this newspaper] The News Freedom Conference opened here at 11:00 AM. The Chinese delegation's seats were arranged in the ninth row of the second section. The assembly hall was built in 1937 and used as the General Assembly Hall of the League of Nations from 1937 to 1939. The United States delegation included five representatives and five alternate representatives. The Soviet delegation was led by Ambassador to France, Mr. Bogomolov. The Chinese delegation has moved from the Seize Hotel to the Eton Hotel. They were quite tired after six days of continuous flying, and Mr. Ma Xingye's ears were severely affected by the noise of the aircraft engines. The Chinese government's response regarding the United Nations' news freedom issue will be presented tomorrow and is generally expected to be one of the most comprehensive responses submitted by various countries. In today's meeting, the Chinese delegation distinguished itself in two aspects: (1) Mr. Bogomolov suggested that non-member states of the United Nations should have the right to vote in the election of the General Assembly Chairman, but the head of the Chinese delegation, Mr. Zhang Pengchun, opposed this, and the result was a victory with 27 votes against 6; (2) The Chinese delegation recommended General Romulo, the chief representative of the Philippines, as Chairman of the General Assembly, and Mr. Romulo was elected as a result. (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing from this newspaper)

[United Press Geneva, March 23] The United Nations News Freedom Conference opened here today, with representatives from more than fifty countries, totaling 300 people, participating. United Nations Under-Secretary-General Koh Heng delivered the opening speech, criticizing world newspapers, saying, "It is most unfortunate that people in various countries around the world have not been able to obtain the truth about the world situation. The time has come to find ways to make news reporting both free and responsible. New scientific inventions have greatly advanced transportation, and the dissemination of current events and opinions through printing, speech, and images has greatly expanded the entire concept of what was previously called news freedom. Judging from the current general news reports, the world is on the brink of a third world war, which is regrettable." The conference is expected to last five weeks. All 57 member states of the United Nations and 13 non-member states were invited to participate, and almost all countries within the Soviet sphere of influence are represented.

### British House of Commons Discusses Defense Against Atomic Bombs

[Reuters London, March 22] The House of Commons held a civil defense debate today. Mr. Anderson, former Chairman of the UK Atomic Energy Advisory Committee and wartime Chancellor of the Exchequer in Churchill's coalition cabinet, advocated for the rapid formulation of policies to enable people to evade the effects of atomic bombs. He pointed out that the effects of an atomic bomb explosion can be studied in four categories: (1) the blast force of the explosion; (2) the high heat generated by the explosion; (3) the radiation effects after the explosion; and (4) the sustained effects after the explosion. He said that the blast force of an atomic bomb is the same as that of an ordinary bomb, except in the area close to the center of the explosion, so ground-based anti-bomb facilities can still be adopted. As for dealing with the burning of high heat after the explosion, even very thin materials, even parchment paper, can prevent it. To avoid radiation exposure, thick-walled facilities should be used. Air-raid shelters from the last war only need to have their walls thickened to avoid radiation effects. It is best to have thick concrete walls; otherwise, stacking several feet of sandbags outside can also isolate radiation effects. As for the persistence and transmission of effects after the explosion, it is difficult to determine how long people hiding in air-raid shelters must wait before they can go outside. The simplest preventive measure is to distribute simple instruments to test the effects of the explosion, to be used by the managers of the air-raid shelters after the bombing to determine whether the people inside the shelters can go outside. Although the handling of materials contaminated by radiation effects after the bombing is more difficult, most of the radiation will disappear in a very short time, so people in air-raid shelters only need to wear appropriate boots, shoes, and gloves to go outside for a short period, and can even pass through areas still affected by radiation.

### Japanese Transportation Workers to Go on Full Strike

### Conscription Lottery Completed; List of Selected Names to Be Announced Starting Today; Numbers 183 to 619 Drawn for Ages 21 and 23

[Report from this newspaper] This city's pioneering conscription lottery for this year was held yesterday under close scrutiny from all parties. The lottery numbers drawn included 183 and others for those born in the 16th year of the Republic (i.e., 21 years old), totaling 211 lottery numbers; 183 and others for those born in the 15th year, totaling 196 lottery numbers; and 45 and others for those born in the 14th year, totaling 212 lottery numbers. The names of eligible young men selected in each district will be publicly announced sequentially, starting today, after matching them with the numbers.

The Military Service Association held a grand ceremony when the lottery was conducted at 2:00 PM yesterday on the third floor of the City Council, as the city's conscription lottery was a pioneering effort. Attending the lottery meeting of the Military Service Association were all committee members, district chiefs from each district, representatives of district residents, representatives of the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party, representatives from the garrison district, City Council, Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, local associations, the Supervisory Commissioner's Office, and the District Prosecutor's Office, including Fang Zhi, Xu Jiyun, Zhao Junhao, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, Gu Ruilin, Cai Qinglan, Chen Tianqiao, and over a hundred other people. Commander Chuan Zhengmo from the Shanghai Garrison District attended the meeting on behalf of the Bureau of Military Service of the Ministry of National Defense to provide guidance. The ceremony was presided over by Mayor Wu Guobai, who also serves as the Conscription Supervisor, and City Councilor Speaker Pan Gongzhan, who also serves as the Director of the Military Service Association. Mayor Wu said in his speech: Military service is an obligation that citizens should fulfill, as is the case in the United States and the Soviet Union. Recruiting volunteers is not the best approach, so the lottery system is also being implemented this year. The selected young men have been reported to the central government for permission to stay in Shanghai to protect the local area, achieving two objectives at once. Representatives from various legal entities are invited to participate in the lottery process together, and the names of the selected young men will be announced to prevent abuses. If any sectors discover any instances of bribery, they are encouraged to report them as much as possible. Commander Chuan said in his speech that only 6,000 people are being selected from the city's more than 170,000 eligible young men this year, which is a very small number, and he specifically stated that selected young men who fail the physical examination will not be allowed to enlist.

### Reasons for Adopting an Indirect Lottery Method

Director Pan said in his speech that the reason for the indirect lottery is that the city has more than 170,000 eligible men, and "the situation does not allow each person to come to the venue to draw a lottery in person." The Military Service Association representatives will draw the lottery according to law, and he hopes that all parties will promote this more to establish a good foundation for the city's military administration. Director Fang provided two points of view: (1) Recently, slogans have appeared that damage military administration and oppose the lottery, which are clearly the work of underground communist agents, and it should be suggested that the government severely punish them. (2) The lives of the selected young men should be substantially improved in the future. Finally, Director of Civil Affairs and Deputy Director of the Military Service Association, Zhang Xiaosong, explained the lottery method (already published in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month) and reported that the total number of eligible young men in the 16th, 15th, and 14th years of the Republic is 220,299. The number of applicants for exemption or deferment was 118,631. After review and approval, 51,315 were granted deferment of call-up, 7,049 were granted deferment of conscription, 814 were granted exemption from military service, 11 were granted prohibition from military service, 13,831 provided supplementary documents, and 45,611 were disapproved. There are now 174,688 participants in the lottery. The 16th, 15th, and 14th years will participate in the lottery first. If the quota can be filled, the 13th and 12th years will stop drawing. Mr. Zhang continued to report on compiling the lottery number roster, using the bao as the unit. There are a total of 1,088 bao in the city. The third bao of Luwan District has the most eligible young men, with 211 from the 16th year, 196 from the 15th year, and 212 from the 14th year. The 39th bao of Yangjing District has the fewest, with only one from the 16th year and three from the 15th year. The 44th bao in the same district only has one person from the 14th year.

### Roster Sealed; Lottery Begins

After Mr. Zhang finished his report, representatives checked the lottery number rosters, and Mayor Wu, Director Pan, and representatives from each district sealed and signed each one, packing them into three wooden cabinets. Afterwards, according to law, Director Pan and representative Zhou Xuexiang began to draw the lottery. The atmosphere in the meeting immediately became tense. Under the gaze of the crowd, Director Pan first drew lottery number 183 for the 16th year, and then drew 211 lottery numbers in order, such as 125 and 100. For the 15th year, 196 lottery numbers were drawn, such as 183, 61, and 137. For the 14th year, 212 lottery numbers were drawn, such as 45, 201, and 88. All were carefully checked and recorded in the roster. The lottery work was completed successfully, and it was already early evening.

The names of the selected men from each district, which were drawn yesterday, are scheduled to be matched with the numbers at the City Council starting at 9:00 AM today. Two councilors from each district, one representative from the district residents, and one representative each from the Kuomintang, Democratic Socialist Party, and Youth Party are invited to supervise the process each day. The district assignments for matching numbers for the three days are as follows: 24th: Huangpu District, Wusong District, Yulin District, Tilanqiao District, North Sichuan Road District, Dachang District, Penglai District, Yimiao District, Laoza District. 25th: Luyu District, Changshu District, Xinshi District, Jiangwan District, Xinjing District, Longhua District, Sisheng District, Yangjing District, Gaoqiao District, Zhenru District. 26th: Changning District, Jing'an District, Xincheng District, Jiangbei District, Songshan District, Putuo District, Zhabei District, North Railway Station District, Hongkou District, Xuhui District.

District Chiefs' Opinions: List Should Not Be Published

The Military Service Association held an interim standing committee meeting after the lottery yesterday. To prevent various abuses, a detailed discussion was held on the issue of publishing the list of selected young men. It was decided that a partial list would be published after matching the numbers today, and a decision would be made later on whether to publish the entire list depending on the situation. The district chiefs of each district also held a meeting last night and generally believed that, given the current situation, the list of selected young men should not be published to avoid desertion. Each district separately convened meetings of bao chiefs overnight to provide input for the authorities to adopt.

### Applications for Review Can Be Supplemented for Reasons for Deferment or Exemption

(2) Issues that do not fall under "winning the election" or "election" but are due to improper actions by the central or local government that harm the rights or interests of the people can be appealed directly to the Ministry of Interior and cannot be litigated in court.

### Postal Remittance Bureau Personnel Fly to Hong Kong to Testify in the Xu Jizhuang Case; District Court Preserves Evidence and Seizes Ocean Liner

[Report from this newspaper] Fang Tinghua, the manager of the Postal Remittance Bureau, and Fang Jianbiao, the chief auditor of the Postal Remittance General Bureau, recently flew to Hong Kong to testify in the Xu Jizhuang embezzlement case. Furthermore, Peng Bingcheng, chairman of the Ocean Shipping Company, owed the Postal Remittance Bureau over 30 billion yuan in collateral. Mr. Peng plans to sell all of the Ocean Shipping Company's ocean liners, worth approximately 40 billion yuan, which would be more than enough to repay the debt. Because the District Court suspected that Mr. Peng colluded with Xu Jizhuang to commit fraud, to preserve evidence, it seized the ocean liner in accordance with Article 133 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Soliciting National Goods for Shipment to Vietnam to Participate in the Goods Exhibition

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall held a joint reception for reporters from various newspapers in the city at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon on the third floor of the Chamber of Commerce, together with the Vietnam Southern Branch General Chamber of Commerce. Representative Cai Maozhi reported on the purpose of coming to Shanghai, stating: In the past, Saigon, Vietnam, held a "Goods Exhibition" once a year, but most of the exhibits were local Vietnamese products. The exhibition period will come again on April 10 this year, but the scope has been expanded to include exhibitions of Chinese, American, British, Soviet, French, and Vietnamese goods. The Southern Branch General Chamber of Commerce has now opened a Chinese Pavilion in the exhibition hall and has received the support of our consulate in Saigon. A special representative has been sent to Shanghai to solicit samples from national goods manufacturers in the city to take back to Vietnam to participate in the exhibition, to add glory to the country and to fulfill the aspirations of the local overseas Chinese. The principle for soliciting goods is one item per manufacturer. If it is inconvenient to carry, photographs and samples can be substituted. If a price is required, the association will pay according to cost; otherwise, it will be responsible for sending it back after the exhibition. All participating manufacturers will be awarded certificates by the association as a souvenir. Mr. Cai also stated that he had negotiated with Air France in Saigon and secured a 500-kilogram tonnage, scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Vietnam on April 2. He hopes that national goods manufacturers in the city will actively participate and strive to send the exhibits for the exhibition to the Commodity Exhibition Hall by the end of this month so that they can be shipped out as scheduled.

### Meeting to Evaluate Standard Land Prices to Be Held Today

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Standard Land Price Evaluation Committee is scheduled to hold its fourth meeting at the Land Administration Bureau at 10:00 AM today to evaluate the standard land prices for the Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Fahua, and Caojing districts, for which land registration has been completed in the 37th year of the Republic.

### Resolving to Thoroughly Eliminate the Practice of Obtaining Materials and Profiteering Therefrom by Establishing Dummy Businesses Under False Names

[Report from this newspaper] The situation in the city is complex, and there are many businesses, some of which inevitably include illegal merchants setting up businesses under false names to make profits. Recently, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation was reported for sugar allocation fraud, which pointed to a large number of "paper" sugar firms with no business facilities or employees, which took advantage of the large difference between the allocated sugar price and the market price to resell the allocated sugar on the black market. The case is currently being investigated by the relevant authorities.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently issued a nationwide order to provincial and municipal authorities in charge, requiring them to thoroughly eliminate businesses that are established under false names and harm the social economy. In accordance with laws and regulations, legal companies and businesses should undergo legal registration, have a fixed capital, business premises or production factories, and should also hire employees and maintain accounts. However, recently, there have been instances where businesses have not been legally registered, or even if they have been registered, they only have a brand name and assume that the business has been established. In reality, they have no business premises or facilities, products, or factories, nor do they have employees or accounts. Some may not even have customer transactions throughout the year, using only the brand name as a talisman for taking advantage of speculation, swindling, disregarding business ethics, and corrupting good customs. Furthermore, during this period of suppressing the rebellion, there are those who seek to obtain important materials controlled and supplied by the government and profit from them, creating panic in the market and obstructing public order. Such businesses that are not properly established, set up under false names, and harm the social economy should be strictly eliminated. Any firm found to have a fictitious name will be punished lightly and ordered to cease operations severely. If someone claims to be a company, they should be sent to the court for punishment. Or, if they operate on the surface but are virtually fictitious, or if they meet the conditions of Article 26 of the Company Law, their registration should be immediately revoked. Businesses and companies that have been banned may not be allowed to resume operations unless they have been legally re-registered and meet the various requirements on the right. Those who knowingly violate the law should be held accountable in accordance with the law to stabilize the market.

Based on the current real amount of assets seized from traitors, it is estimated that lottery tickets can continue to be issued for more than six periods.

### Domestic Airmail Insured Letters; Postage Increased Starting Today

### Lingering Echoes of the Tang Jiapeng Blood Case; Gu Zhuxuan Not Guilty; Prosecutor Appeals

[Report from this newspaper] In the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, manager of the Great World amusement center, 14 years ago, Gu Zhuxuan, the old manager of the Tianchan Opera House, was charged with instigating murder. On October 27 of the 24th year of the Republic, the Second Special District Court sentenced Gu to 15 years in prison. Gu appealed to the High Branch Court, which declared him not guilty on June 26 of the 25th year. The prosecutor appealed the decision, and the Supreme Court sent the case back for a retrial. The War of Resistance broke out, and the case was delayed until now.

The High Court repeatedly summoned Gu for questioning starting on September 8 of last year. However, important witnesses Zhao Guangfu, Wang Xinggao, Zhang Tinggui, Xue Zhenji, etc., had either died or their whereabouts were unknown. The High Court then relied on the evaluation report of the clerk of the former High Branch Court, which determined that Zhao Guangfu's blackmail letter was handwritten, and that there was indeed a suspicion of blackmailing Gu Zhuxuan, and declared him not guilty on December 31 of last year. This 14-year-old blood case could have come to an end. However, Luo Shouchang, the prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, still had questions about the case and expressed disagreement with the original judgment. He recently filed an appeal with the Supreme Court. The reason for the appeal was that Gu's previous and subsequent testimonies were inconsistent, and there was considered to be a major suspicion of "instigating murder." The reason why the Supreme Court sent the case back for a retrial in the past was because Zhao Guangfu's blackmail letter was quite questionable. Now, the High Court is investigating the case, relying only on the evaluation report of the clerk of the High Branch Court from more than ten years ago, and there is no other more powerful evidence to prove that it was written by Zhao. The determination that it was written by Zhao's own hand is inconsistent with the original intention of sending it back for a retrial. Furthermore, even if we assume that the letter was written by Zhao, why did Zhao not blackmail others, but only blackmail Gu Zhuxuan? There must be a reason for this, and it should be investigated. This blood case, which had come to an end, has "lingering echoes that never cease" due to the prosecutor's appeal.

### Landing Craft Robbed in Yingkou, Over 20 Dead, Injured, and Missing; Crew Unions Hold Emergency Meeting and Resolve to Petition for Thorough Investigation of Responsibility

[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s Landing Craft No. 105 was detained by bandits in Yingkou on the 28th of last month. It escaped on the 4th of this month and was towed back to Huludao by the Ji Ping. Then, it was towed to Tianjin and is currently undergoing repairs there. These details have already been reported in previous editions. It is now known that the vessel was bombarded when it escaped from Yingkou, causing damage to the hull, resulting in the deaths of four crew members and injuries to three others. Eighteen people, including the chief mate, Sun Jibo, are missing and their whereabouts remain unknown. The bureau is currently making efforts to handle the aftermath for the dead and injured, and is also investigating the missing. Five senior crew unions, including those for merchant ship masters and marine engineers, believe that the authorities mishandled the incident involving the landing craft, arguing that the vessel should not have been forced to sail to that area, leading to its detention by bandits. They convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday (the 21st) and resolved to send a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stating that guarantees should be provided to crew members when vessels are dispatched in the future. They also submitted three points to the Ministry of Transportation: (1) Request the government to thoroughly investigate responsibility and severely punish responsible officials; (2) Send a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, offering generous compensation to the families of the victims (in accordance with the Maritime Law, three times the amount of compensation);

### Active Resistance Should Be Given to Hiring Foreign Seamen

(3) Also, the shipping companies (organized with vessels compensated by the government for private sector losses) have already sent personnel to the United States to receive new ships. It is heard that they are planning to hire foreign senior crew members on a long-term basis, which should be actively resisted. The five senior crew unions believe that shipowners are opposing the opening of inland river shipping routes on the one hand, while on the other hand, they are protecting their own interests and depriving Chinese crew members of their livelihood, which is contradictory. Moreover, in the past year, as many as seven Chinese merchant ships have been sunk and lost due to the dereliction of duty of foreign captains. The intentions of the shipowners are unknown and difficult to understand, so further discussions will be held to devise countermeasures.

### Flower and Tree Industry Holds General Meeting

According to weather forecasts, today will still be cloudy and cold, with light rain. It may become overcast in the evening. There will be strong northerly winds outside Wusongkou. The cold air currents have been repeatedly lingering and not retreating in recent days, so the arrival of a warm spring may still have to wait.

### Fire on Lin Sen Middle Road

### Conflict on Bus Involving Soldiers; Conductor Injured

[Our Report] Yesterday evening at 8:30 PM, on City Public Utility Bureau Bus No. 330, Route 13, as it arrived at Xieqiao Station from the South Wharf Station, three navy soldiers requested to board the bus. At that time, the bus was already extremely crowded, so conductor No. 756 asked them to take a later bus. However, the soldiers refused and insisted on boarding, eventually leading to an argument and then a conflict. The conductor was injured on the spot. At the same time, the buses that followed, upon hearing the news, stopped one after another, and some of the passengers also joined the fight. When the military police arrived, they took both parties to the police station for investigation. The navy soldiers involved, Lin Shouyue and Chen Xuehui, were sent to the Military Police Corps. That night, they, together with the City Public Utility Bureau and the navy's Shanghai-based agency, mediated the matter, which was resolved late at night. The injured conductor was sent to the Kung Chi Hospital.

### Suspected Grafting in Rice Distribution; Zhang Sen, Chief of the Changning District Bao, Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation

[Our Report] The Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday transferred the case of Zhang Sen, chief of the Changning District Bao, who was accused of corruption in rice distribution, to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. According to the bureau's letter, "The Shanghai Municipal Food Allocation Committee stated in its official letter that, according to the report submitted by the personnel dispatched by the committee to Changning District to supervise the second phase of rice distribution to the poor, Zhang Sen, chief of the 28th Bao in the district, handled the procedures improperly in several aspects. Three points were found: (1) Rice purchase certificates were withheld from those who had not paid military conscription consolation money. It was found that the rice purchase certificates of the residents of the Bao, including Huang Mecai, Hong Qinggao, Gong Yuren, Chuan Rongsheng, Jin Weidian, Gu Junhao, Zhou Shaozhi, and Chen Jinyuan, totaling thirteen large-size certificates, were withheld. According to Zhang Sen, this was because they had not paid the military conscription consolation money, resulting in the delayed issuance of rice purchase certificates. However, rice allocation and military service are two separate matters and are not related to each other, so the withholding of rice purchase certificates was inappropriate. (2) Rice purchase certificates of relocated poor people were not returned, but were transferred without authorization. Certificates were not issued to those whose names were on the roster, but were issued to those whose names were not on the roster. According to Zhang, the rice purchase certificates of relocated households were transferred to newly relocated households. However, the Bao had not created a roster for reporting and verification, indicating that there was private transfer of rice purchase certificates. (3) The rice purchase certificates were issued according to the household registration, not based on the roster approved by the committee, which violated the original intention of the committee to issue rice to the poor."

### Suspected Businesses of Illegally Exchanging Foreign Currency Request Unfreezing of Funds; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Appeals to Authorities on Behalf of Transit Merchants

[Our Report] On the 26th of last month, the Municipal Financial Administration, together with the Municipal Police Bureau, investigated 41 businesses suspected of illegally exchanging foreign currency. The responsible persons of each business were released on bail after being taken to the bureau for questioning, but their accounts and funds were frozen pending review. The Municipal Transit Merchants Association stated that the case involved many of its members and sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to uphold justice and quickly devise effective measures to negotiate with the competent authorities to unfreeze the funds first, stating: "Members of the association are engaged in transit trade and are entrusted by merchants from various regions.

After handling the goods, they are transferred to various destinations. The funds for the goods are returned by the merchants to facilitate turnover, which is customary. The methods of returning funds include direct remittances from the merchants, transfers entrusted by the merchants, direct remittances from the merchants' locations, and transfers entrusted by merchants in other locations. The circumstances vary. In essence, the handling of goods is the business of the members of the association, and the return of funds is the business of the entrusting merchants. The members of the association have no right to interfere in the source of funds or the method of returning them, nor can they interfere. Moreover, merchants rely on the use of funds as their lifeline, so when merchants' payments are received, they must be accepted quickly, and there is no reason to refuse or delay acceptance. The main reason for the involvement of the members in this case is that the source of funds and the method of returning them are unclear, leading to suspicions of gold and silver sales or black market foreign exchange transactions. The situation regarding the collection and payment of goods by members of the association has been described above. Unless the competent authorities have found solid evidence, how can they immediately accuse them of violating the law? Moreover, the inflow of funds, regardless of whether they come from any place, even from abroad, is not the same as the escape of funds. Those who receive the funds are not guilty of any offense. In this incident, some people have been detained for more than six or seven days, and all the funds of the businesses involved have been frozen. There is no prospect of when the funds will be unfrozen. If the funds are unfrozen only after the case is over, after several months, all the funds will be lost. (Omitted below)."

After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce stated that, according to the facts presented, the funds received by the transit merchants were purely funds returned by the merchants. If the funds were frozen for a long time, the merchants would be unable to operate, leading to closure and bankruptcy, which would be detrimental to the protection of industry and commerce. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Financial Administration and the Municipal Police Bureau, requesting them to unfreeze the funds of the transit merchants and hoping that similar measures would not be taken again in the future for similar incidents, except for legal investigations.

### A Lone Thief Breaks into a Home and Robs It; Turns Out to Be a Former Colleague

[Our Report] At around 9:00 PM on the 21st, a lone thief broke into the home of Ren Zhang, a driver for the Minsheng Motor Company, at No. 7 Xiangmao Lane, Damuqiao, Nanshi. Under the pretext of asking questions, he forced open the door, took out a sharp knife, and threatened Ren's wife. As a result, he robbed a pair of gold bracelets, four gold rings, and one pound of thread before escaping. When Ren returned home at 11:00 PM, he learned of the incident from his wife, who said that the thief looked familiar and had visited the house once before. After thinking it over, Ren determined that it was Xu Fengqing, a former colleague from the Minsheng Motor Company. He reported the incident to the Changshu Police Precinct and requested an arrest. Officer Yu Zhiming led police officers Liu Guansen and others to search for the suspect. They first arrested Xu's mistress and then captured Xu at Room 34, Aiwen Hotel, Beijing West Road. The case was solved only two hours after it occurred.

### The Magic of Automatic Telephone Connections

[Our Special Report] In recent years, almost all citizens who use the telephone daily have experienced the difficulty of getting through, especially during office hours in the central district. Often, after picking up the phone, one has to wait a long time to hear the dial tone. Everyone knows that this is the result of congested lines. But what exactly is meant by "congestion"?

Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Telephone Company invited reporters from various newspapers to visit the Baxianqiao Exchange and the Fujian Road Exchange, giving us a rough understanding of the telephone communication process.

There are currently more than 60,000 telephone lines in Shanghai (excluding "02"). The connection of these lines is done entirely by automatic rotary machines. Each telephone call, from dialing to connecting, goes through eight different components. The process is like a traveler taking a train. Picking up the phone is like a traveler entering the train station and asking where to buy a ticket. At this time, someone comes forward to help with the luggage, which is equivalent to the line-finding machine in the automatic machine starting to find a line. The user is found by the line-finding machine in a few seconds and connected to the transceiver, just like a porter leading the traveler to the ticket office. After the user is connected to the transceiver, a humming sound can be heard, indicating that the traveler can explain his destination to the ticket office. The desired number is dialed on the dial, and the transceiver connects to the other party through the selector according to these five numbers. This is like the ticket office at the train station arranging the itinerary on behalf of the traveler according to the traveler's wishes, passing through several platforms to reach the destination. The line-finding machine and transceiver each have two sets, and the selector has four sets, so each telephone connection goes through eight sets of machines.

Due to Equipment Limitations, Lines Are Often "Full"

Due to the current limitations of the equipment, every 100 telephone lines are handled by 14 line-finding machines. If 14 lines are in use at the same time, the 15th line will not be able to connect. So, when you pick up the phone and do not hear the dial tone, it means that 14 of the 100 lines in your group have already occupied the line-finding machines, and you must patiently wait until one of the lines becomes available before you can take its place. Because the population of Shanghai has increased dramatically after the war, the telephone fees are relatively low, and the traffic congestion, economic situation, and financial situation are chaotic, the amount of telephone usage has greatly increased. In the central district, each line is used an average of 20 times a day (New York telephone lines average 7 times a day), while the existing equipment is still based on the 1926 standard of 5 times per line per day, so it is naturally not enough. In other words, the 14 line-finding machines for every 100 lines are often all "full," which is why it often takes so long to make a phone call.

Equipment for 10,000 Lines Is Gradually Arriving

The telephone company is currently expanding its equipment. The first batch of equipment and materials ordered from abroad for 10,000 lines has arrived, and assembly has begun in the assembly plant of the Baxianqiao Exchange. These machines were manufactured in underground factories during the war by the French branch of the American International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation and are still arriving in succession. It will take about a year to fully assemble and apply them. The future distribution will be approximately 1,000 sets for numbers beginning with 8, 500 sets for numbers beginning with 9, over 4,000 sets for numbers beginning with 6, and over 2,000 sets for numbers beginning with 4. The rest will be only a small number. Last year, the company ordered another 15,000 lines, but due to foreign exchange difficulties, they cannot be imported in the short term. According to recent statistics, more than 30,000 households have registered with the company to install telephones.

Forgetting to Hang Up the Phone Causes the Green Light Bulb to Light Up

The operation of the machines for controlling users is truly magical. Every time a line is used, the recording machine will turn over a number. If the user fails to pay the telephone bill on time, as long as a plug is inserted into the user's line, they will be unable to make a call. If the user forgets to hang up the phone after using it, the green light bulb on the user's line on the monitoring machine will light up. If the phone is taken off the hook and the dial is not dialed for more than two minutes, a white light bulb will light up. At this time, the telephone company staff will immediately notify the user on the line or issue a strange sound warning on the user's line.

The coating of telephone lines is now gradually being changed to Pastie, which Shanghai people call "glass." The advantage of this type of wire is that it is heat-resistant, durable, beautiful, and does not leak electricity. In the near future, all telephone lines can be completely replaced.

97222 Will Prompt You to Wake Up on Time

In terms of service, in addition to the "01" repair service, the "09" telephone number inquiry service, the "00" emergency service, and the "95678" time report service, which are already familiar to the public, there is also the "97222" wake-up service and the answering service. If users must get up early on a certain day to catch a plane, train, ship, or other important matter and are afraid of oversleeping and missing their appointment, they can call "97222" to notify them in advance. The service can call on time to prompt them to get up. Also, if users go out of town with their whole family and there is no one at home to answer the phone, they can call this number to inform them. Afterwards, when someone calls, the service can answer and record the message on their behalf. The wake-up service is completely free, while the answering service is charged a fee.

Automatic Dialing Machines; Only Two in Shanghai

In addition, there are two new types of equipment. One is an automatic switchboard, which allows telephone users with many extensions to do without a switchboard operator. The other is an automatic dialing machine, which can automatically dial 50 numbers. This is for people who frequently make calls, saving them the trouble of dialing the numbers themselves. There are only two of these machines in Shanghai, and one has already been rented out.

Eight Different Machines Must Be Passed Through to Magically Connect

### Could the Circulating Notes Stand Firm? A Disputed Question

[Our Shenyang Office Dispatch, 20th] Since the Ministry of Finance announced the regulations for exchanging the Northeast Circulating Notes on February 15th, opinions have differed, and there has been much debate. People in the Northeast generally believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, causing unrest. A country's monetary system should be unified, and the special status should be broken sooner or later. However, the prolonged internal strife has prevented the realization of the ideal of reorganizing the Northeast currency system. The transitional measures announced by the Ministry of Finance are not entirely satisfactory. I would like to offer my humble opinions on the issuance basis, destabilizing factors, different viewpoints, and the impact of the new measures regarding the circulating notes.

Issuance Basis

After the recovery of the Northeast, the government carefully considered the implementation of the circulating note system, weighing the situation at the time. The separation of the currency systems inside and outside Shanhaiguan could ensure a more stable standard of living for the people of the Northeast. On the other hand, the Northeast is rich in resources with unlimited potential, and the barrier between currencies inside and outside Shanhaiguan would help the development of economic undertakings in the Northeast. To summarize, the basis for issuing circulating notes can be roughly divided into three points:

(1) At the beginning of the takeover, there were 12 billion yuan of puppet Manchukuo currency circulating in the market. It was difficult to determine the exchange rate between the legal tender and the Manchukuo currency for a while. The issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan would inevitably cause financial chaos. Therefore, the Northeast Nine Provinces Circulating Notes were issued. The exchange rate with the legal tender was announced by the Central Bank on August 16, 1946, set at one to eleven and a half yuan.

(2) To facilitate the plunder of resources in the Northeast, the Soviet army issued 9.725 billion yuan of Red Army notes in the Northeast (the figure notified by the Soviet side, which is generally doubted by the public). In the view of our government authorities, this tool of plunder should be limited to the Northeast for reorganization to prevent North China from being harmed. Prohibiting the issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan had the significance of economic warfare. By the end of August 1946, the reorganization of the Red Army notes had come to an end.

(3) At that time, the general prices in the Northeast were much more stable than those inside Shanhaiguan. The issuance of legal tender with large denominations outside Shanhaiguan would inevitably disrupt this state and cause unrest in people's lives, which would hinder political and economic recovery. However, people with foresight had pointed out early on that the Northeast is a part of China, and the special circumstances could not exist for a long time. In terms of the monetary system, it would be better to allow the legal tender to be issued outside Shanhaiguan as soon as possible and used at the same time as the circulating notes, determine the exchange rate, and gradually recover the circulating notes. From an overall point of view, this is very reasonable.

Destabilizing Factors

In the past two years, due to the continued destruction of internal strife, not only has the ideal of reorganizing the Northeast currency system been shelved, but the foothold of the circulating notes has also been unstable. In terms of the objective environment, military and political expenditures are enormous, the complete recovery of the nine provinces is nowhere in sight, transportation is cut off, exports are impossible, and everything depends on imports. In terms of human factors, the exchange rate management is poor, black market exchange has not been eliminated, the circulating notes are flooded in Tianjin and Beijing, the black market is devalued, and the circulating notes in the occupied areas are used to purchase materials from the recovered areas at low prices. These factors have shaken the credibility of the circulating notes. At the same time, the misfortune of inflation in the Northeast has caused great shock and fright to the people. The speed of printing circulating notes cannot keep up with such huge expenditures. The increase in the number of currency issued cannot keep up with the increase in prices. This violent blow has made the people of the Northeast deeply resent the circulating notes psychologically, doubt the issuance reserves of the circulating notes based on the enemy and puppet industries in the Northeast, and also hold a "non-belief doctrine" towards the issuance figures of the circulating notes. This is a secret figure. Wang Huayi, one of the representatives of the Northeast petition group, announced a figure of 5 trillion in Nanjing. The financial authorities of the local headquarters had strictly denied it. According to more reliable figures, it is 500 billion yuan. Judging from the lack of chips in the Northeast, 500 billion yuan is more accurate. This figure is very different from the astronomical figure believed by the people of the Northeast. There are also many people who are worried that the circulating notes will encounter misfortune like the Manchukuo currency and the Red Army notes in the future, so they have no confidence at all. The wave of enthusiasm for reforming the currency system surged from the Northeast to Nanjing.

Different Viewpoints

The financial authorities do not agree with reforming the Northeast currency system at this time. Mr. Zhang Jia'ao has studied the issue of issuing large denomination circulating notes of 2,000 yuan in detail, which shows his prudence in handling financial issues. There are many reasons why they oppose the current reform, mainly the following:

(1) The interest rates inside Shanhaiguan are higher, and there is an abundance of floating capital. Once the dam of circulating notes is opened, the floating capital will flow in in large quantities, which is obviously detrimental to the industry and commerce inside Shanhaiguan.

(2) If the legal tender is issued outside Shanhaiguan, the currency in the Northeast will increase, and prices will inevitably rise more sharply, which will be detrimental to the lives of the general public.

(3) In view of the financial market fluctuations caused by the exchange of Soviet military tickets, the issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan and the revision of the exchange rate will inevitably cause suspicion among the general public.

(4) However, no matter what method is adopted to reform the currency system, both currencies must be allowed to be used at the same time during the transition period. At the beginning, the Soviet military tickets were used to replace the Manchukuo currency in the recovered areas. Although the reorganization has been largely completed, the Soviet military tickets in other unrecovered areas still need to be reorganized. Due to military relations, the Manchukuo currency has not been fully recovered. If the legal tender is allowed to circulate again, it will increase the difficulty of reorganizing the currency system in the future.

Most local people hold the opposite view of the above viewpoints. They said that the Northeast is at the front line of national defense and it is extremely unfair to bear such huge war expenses alone, and it has reached the point where it is unable to bear it. The increasing devaluation of the circulating notes is making the people of the Northeast lose their property invisibly, so it must be reformed immediately.

The government authorities' position focuses on considering currency system issues from an economic point of view, while the local position is permeated with political emotions to measure it. Finance is a bridge between economics and politics, and the integration of the two depends on finance. Therefore, in handling currency system issues, there should be a long-term vision, detailed plans, deep understanding, and ample experience.

New Measures

The new measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on March 15 have been formally opposed by the Northeast provinces and cities' councils and civil groups. In the eyes of local people, the regulations restricting the use and exchange locations of circulating notes inside Shanhaiguan do not restrict the increase in the issuance of circulating notes. Therefore, the issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan is of little benefit to the prices and people's livelihood in the Northeast. At the same time, the exchange rate between the legal tender and the circulating notes has been revised to one to ten, and the official price of the circulating notes has been devalued. The increase in the prices of public utilities such as postal and telecommunications is a good example.

The actual impact of the issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan and the revision of the exchange rate of the circulating notes depends on the reaction after the Central Bank stipulates detailed measures for exchange and conversion. It is not appropriate to judge the gains and losses at this time, but three issues are worth noting:

(1) Will the circulating notes continue to be issued? Judging from the actual situation, it is probably impossible to stop the issuance. At present, there is a great shortage of chips in various parts of the Northeast, so that the salaries of public and private teachers and soldiers cannot be paid on time. It is quite difficult to transport a large amount of legal tender to the Northeast.

(2) Can the black market for circulating notes be eliminated? Since the exchange of circulating notes is strictly restricted inside Shanhaiguan, the large amount of circulating notes flowing into Shanhaiguan can only go to the black market. Assuming that the exchange rate in the Northeast is relaxed to the maximum extent, the inflow of circulating notes into Shanhaiguan cannot be avoided. For example, the vast area south of Jinzhou does not have internal exchange. At present, only the Beining Railway is open. Commerce is active. The exchange between Shanhaiguan and Beiping cannot meet the large demand. The black market cannot be eliminated. After the official price of the circulating notes is devalued, the black market will also be devalued.

(3) Although prices in the Northeast are at the peak of the country, the issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan will still give it a strong stimulus. Since the 15th, food and cotton cloth have risen sharply, which is very obvious.

The circulating notes have become a disputed issue. The central position and the local position are obviously opposed. If we do not focus on fundamentally reorganizing the currency system, it is difficult to reconcile the two positions. In short, at such a tense military stage in the Northeast, arguing about the issue of circulating notes is of no great significance and there is no room for doubt. (Our reporter Zhao Zhan)

### The Internal Situation of the Communist Banditry in Hainan is Empty

[Our Haikou Office Dispatch, 18th] The scourge of banditry in Hainan did not begin today. According to the pacification report publicly issued by the 46th Army in the past, as early as the period of the Republic of China in 1927, bandits had begun to operate on Hainan Island. By 1930, the bandit forces became more active. In 1937, when the war of resistance broke out, the bandits took the opportunity to form the "Hainan People's Self-Defense Group Independent Detachment." In February 1939, when the Japanese army landed, the bandits changed the independent detachment to the independent general detachment, with the permission of Wang Yi, the garrison commander at the time, and collected the guns of the people in Qiongshan, Wenchang, Chengmai, and Ding'an counties, as well as the original armed forces, and formed three battalions, one independent battalion, and one special service company. In April 1940, a group of more than 400 bandits from Zhuanggutian in southern Anhui sneaked to Wenchang and landed nearby. Since then, the bandit forces have grown day by day and actively expanded their armed forces and organization, dividing the general detachment into detachments, battalions, companies, etc. After 1943, the bandits had expanded from three detachments to five detachments. After the surrender of the Japanese army, because our side had not formally taken over, a state of anarchy was formed locally, and the bandits took the opportunity to operate again, and their power increased. Each county formed a Mengjin battalion, an independent battalion, etc., and each battalion expanded from 500 people to 1,000 people, scattered in the countryside to operate. The county was divided into districts, townships, baos, jias, and groups. Last year, the bandit army was ordered to be reorganized into the "Qiongya Column of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," and at the same time, the "Bandit Hainan Provincial Democratic Government" was established, with bandit leader Feng Baiju as commander and chairman of the provincial government. According to the South China News Agency, the bandit army in Hainan Island has planned to increase to 15 detachments. However, in recent years, due to the constant suppression by the national army, the strength of the bandit side has been reduced day by day. According to the people who escaped from the bandit area, most of the guns used by the communists are home-made powder guns, which shows that their internal situation is empty. Recently, the bandits have once again pretended to cover up their increasingly defeated signs and ran in different ways to Lingao Cui County, trying to create terror and disturb the people's hearts, but after being severely damaged by our army, the bandits have collapsed in a panic. According to the Qingxiang Department News Group, their ultimate goal is nothing more than plundering materials and disrupting order.

### One Bandit Shot in Daqi

On the morning of the 22nd, he was escorted to Daqi and executed by shooting.

### Talking About Sichuan Defense Amidst the Sound of War Drums

[Our Chengdu Office Dispatch, 16th] Since the provincial government announced the implementation of a wartime system in Sichuan Province this year and the establishment of the Sichuan Province Pacification and National Construction Mobilization Committee, it shows that Sichuan has entered a wartime state from peacetime. The deployment of troops on the Daba Mountains, the most important issue for the current provincial administration in Sichuan, has long been of concern to compatriots across the country. Thanks to the sincere cooperation between the military and civilians and the government in Sichuan in recent months, the copper wall and iron wall of Sichuan's defense has been built, which will also shatter the communist bandits' dream of spying on Sichuan. Chairman Deng Xihou once firmly and optimistically told reporters that he wanted to "settle the people within the Daba Mountains and keep the bandits outside the Daba Mountains." From the recent deployment trends in Sichuan, I can see the whole picture of Sichuan's defense and share his firm confidence.

Two Defense Lines, Three Major Projects

The defense line of Sichuan Province starts from Motianling on the border of Sichuan and Gansu, along the Micang Mountains to the Daba Mountains. This is the Daba Mountain National Defense Line bordering Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Hubei. It is divided into two defense lines. The first defense line includes Pingwu, Qingchuan, Guangyuan, Zhaohua, Nanjiang, Wanyuan, Chengkou, and Wushan. The second line includes Beichuan, Jiangyou, Jiange, Mianyang, Zhangming, Cangxi, Yilong, Bazhong, Daxian, Kaijiang, Xuanhan, Yunyang, and Fengjie. The deployment work on these two winding and long national defense lines is arduous. The Sichuan Provincial Government has launched a moving military-civilian cooperation, mobilizing millions of migrant workers: The first step is to rush to repair bunkers. Within a month, more than 1,500 bunkers were completed, of which 50 were giant chain-style, and there were telecommunications, waterways, and transportation lines connecting the forts, towering in the Daba Mountains. The second step is to form a highway network, rush to repair the arc-shaped national defense highway around northeastern Sichuan, and plan to complete the first phase of the project: (1) Nan (bu)-Ba (zhong) Line, (2) Wan (xian)-Kai (xian) Line, (3) Tong (jiang)-Nan (jiang) Line, the total length of the three lines is 585 kilometers. The second phase of the project is to complete: (1) Tong (jiang)-Qing (jiangdu) Line, (2) Guang (yuan)-Wang (cang) Line, (3) Liang (shan)-Kai (jiang) Line, the total length of the three lines is 190 kilometers. At present, the "Daba Mountain National Defense Highway Survey Team" is conducting a survey and mobilizing 100,000 migrant workers to implement the project. The third step is to deploy telecommunications, set up a communications network between special commissioner areas, counties, and townships within the defense area on the two defense lines. From Guangyuan, Dawu, and Bazhong, we will build a 2,400-kilometer-long power line. The funds are included in this year's local budget and are being rushed to repair. Bunkers, highways, and telecommunications are the material defense lines of Sichuan.

The People of Sichuan and Sichuan are Mobilized

As the spiritual defense line of Sichuan, the provincial government has mobilized the great and unparalleled manpower of the two Sichuan provinces; The first step is to launch a local self-defense movement, first in the prefecture and counties where the defense is set up, organize volunteer police teams and self-defense brigades, gradually register civil guns, investigate household registration, organize and train the people, and all people aged 18 to 45 are incorporated into the self-defense force to receive training and participate in the work of protecting their hometowns and defending the country. The second step is to implement the national compulsory labor, mobilizing nearly one million migrant workers to repair bunkers, highways, and telecommunications, three major defense projects. The third step is to launch a general movement for knowledgeable youth to join the army, calling on the passionate youth of the two Sichuan provinces to shoulder the task of pacifying the chaos and building the country. Initially, 200 youths were mobilized to join the camp in each county, but the actual number has now exceeded the target. The fourth step is to mobilize various specialized talents to participate in the promotion of various national defense engineering projects. The provincial government recently specially set up a "Talent Coordination Association" to handle this work. Sichuan contributed unparalleled manpower in the War of Resistance and created a glorious victory. Facts prove that the current compatriots in Sichuan have once again accepted the historical task, enthusiastically and generously, vying to serve in the military, and will write the glorious second page in the history of the War of Resistance and National Construction.

Four-Level Self-Defense, Three-Province Joint Defense

The defense plan implemented by the Sichuan Provincial Government: The first step is the widespread joint defense of counties and cities. 120 counties have implemented this, and 31 command posts have been established. The whole province is implementing a four-level self-defense system. The province is responsible for the security general team, the administrative special commissioner area is responsible for the security brigade, and the county and township are responsible for the police, so that each unit has the troop strength to be used flexibly. The second step is to implement the joint defense of the three provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. This month, Lin Shuen, the secretary-general of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, came to Rong and had specific discussions with Chairman Deng Xihou. A complete plan has been drafted. The joint defense counties include Bazhong and Tongjiang in Sichuan Province, Hanzhong and Baocheng in Shaanxi Province, and Xigu and Wudu in Gansu Province. The 27 counties are divided into the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu Garrison Area. The third step is to equip the armed forces and divide the defense area. The whole province is divided into the eastern Sichuan and northern Sichuan garrison areas. Eastern Sichuan is based on Daxian, and northern Sichuan is centered on Guangyuan, and is divided into commander by Fang Jing and Huang Yin concurrently. In addition, the Guangyuan Forward Command Post is responsible for unifying the command of military and political affairs in northern Sichuan. In terms of armed forces, it is a matter of national defense secrets, but it is generally believed that in addition to local armed forces such as self-defense forces and local teams, the total military strength in Sichuan will never be less than eight divisions and ten security corps. The fourth step is to cooperate with other defense affairs. Air Force: It is reported that the Central Government will send ×× bombing teams to Sichuan, and the Huaxi base will be used for ×× mixed aircraft groups. Air defense: It has been decided to restore the air defense headquarters, and four command posts will be set up in Chongqing, Wanxian, Zigong, and Luxian. Other measures such as the emergency requisition of commercial vehicles, the borrowing of civil guns, and the recent registration by the provincial government of aviation, railway, telecommunications and various transportation and other engineering specialized talents all show the determination and efforts of the provincial government in promoting defense work in Sichuan.

Keeping Bandits Out, Settling the People Inside

As for the communist bandits' attempt to spy on Sichuan, the situation has changed due to the recent strict deployment and increased pressure from the national army. In the past, it was rumored that the bandit troops of Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, Li Xiannian, and Kong Congzhou might sneak into Sichuan, but now Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng are trapped and embarrassed in the Dabie Mountains, Li Xiannian is cramped and gasping for breath in a corner of Chiefdom, and Kong Congzhou is fleeing in a panic to the border area of Shaanxi and Gansu. They are too busy to protect themselves, how dare they sneak west? At the same time, the establishment of the Henan-Hubei-Sichuan-Shaanxi Pacification Command has the greatest effect on the stability of Sichuan's defense. However, the Sichuan Provincial Government will never slack off in deployment due to the easing of the situation, because the Sichuan Provincial defense strategy is active. The highest principle of this strategy is Deng Xihou's declaration of "settling the people within the Daba Mountains and keeping the bandits outside the Daba Mountains." In Ming Dynasty, Gu Zuyu's Fang Yu Ji Yao defined Sichuan's defense in the first place as "Sichuan is not a place to sit and defend," and pointed out: "Defend with war, and the defense will be solid. Fight with defense, and the battle will be strong. Those who defend Jiange should not use Jiange, and those who defend Qutang should not use Qutang." He explained the principle of deployment "Setting up danger to gain people is the foundation, ensuring safety with wisdom is the first, people winning danger is the top, danger winning people is the bottom, and people and danger are equal, then we can get the middle strategy." The current defense work in Sichuan is being promoted based on these principles. Today, hundreds of thousands of troops have formed a copper wall and iron wall in the Daba Mountains. The healthy children of Sichuan have determined to eliminate the communist bandits outside the borders of Sichuan. If the communist bandits sneak in, the people of Sichuan believe that the towering and majestic Bashan Jiange will definitely be their burial place. (Our reporter Zhou Xueduan)

### Looking Forward to the Dajia River: A Huge Power Source Three Times Stronger Than Sun Moon Lake

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 18th Air Dispatch] He Wan has the only source of light - Sun Moon Lake, which has been shining powerfully for fifteen years, nourishing industry and farmland, and bringing vitality to the rulers. However, the requirements of the new era are forcing people to believe that Sun Moon Lake is gradually aging, and to re-invest in another new and great power source, which is the Dajia River Hydropower Station.

In coordination with the Japanese industrial plan, the 152,000 kilowatts of power generated by Sun Moon Lake is not enough to support it. They pinned their hopes on the Dajia River to develop the driving force for heavy industry. Not only is it limited to supplying the province, but it can also transmit light to Fujian through the Taiwan Strait. Originally, the Japanese held the ambition and illusion of permanent occupation.

The Dajia River is located in the central part of He Wan, with a length of 142 kilometers. It originates from Mount Cilai, which is more than 3,000 meters above sea level, and has the most abundant hydropower in the entire island. The plan is to build the Dajian High Dam and the Dajian Reservoir upstream as the hub. From Dajian downstream to the vicinity of Shigangzhuang, more than 60 kilometers away, using the huge drop of more than 1,200 meters, eight power plants will be established in succession. The combined power generation is 458,500 kilowatts. Because the Dajian Reservoir regulates the flow smoothly, the normal power generation is 321,000 kilowatts. It can support the main force for the development of heavy industry, and can also shoulder the tasks of flood control, water supply, and irrigation of 98,000 mu of paddy fields!

In February 1942, the Japanese Parliament approved the construction budget for the reservoir with a huge sum of 125 million Japanese yen. However, due to the lack of equipment and insufficient financial resources, it was impossible to avoid the setback of the project even if the construction standards were lowered, which led to the change of plan and the completion of the Meiji Highway and the construction of the railway from Fengyuan to Dongshi in 1943. The three power plants built by Taiwan Power Company, including Tianleng, Fengyuan First, and Meiji, also encountered the same fate. Among them, 80% of the civil engineering of Tianleng No. 1 Plant has been completed.

Taiwan Power Company is now handing over the civil engineering, which only needs to be completed by one-fifth, to the Provincial Engineering Company for execution. In September of the 35th year, the estimated cost of this project to be completed was about 210 million yuan, but now it needs more than 10 billion yuan (machines, etc. need about 10 million US dollars). This has to be said to be a large sum of money. Time has increased the value of this great project. The first phase of the project that the Engineering Company has decided to carry out is the longest No. 8 tunnel among all eleven tunnels (a total of 10 kilometers and 100 meters). Of the 3 kilometers and 100 meters of this aqueduct, the Japanese completed one-half, but those who receive this inheritance need to complete it. In the completed lower section of one kilometer, the water is usually deep enough to submerge the ankles, and in the rainy season, it becomes a flood. The project is unusually difficult, and the collapsed middle section needs to be rebuilt. The Engineering Company believes that this is not a technical problem, but whether the Wanli Company has sufficient funds and can be fully completed in three or five years after the current construction starts.

The preparation posture for this project has long been completed, and the Engineering Company also sent engineers to conduct on-site surveys last month. If this great and fruitful project can be started quickly, we should thank the American Reynolds Aluminum Company, because its cooperation with the Aluminum Company forces the Power Company to supply as much as possible to the largest customers in the province. Only in this way can the Dajia River emit light more than three times stronger than Sun Moon Lake, which is the starting point for Taiwan's heavy industry construction!

### Wuxi Employees' Salaries Calculated in Rice: Employers Request Payment Based on the Cost of Living Index

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 21st Dispatch] The salaries of employees in factories and shops in this county are all based on rice as the standard. The price of rice has risen repeatedly, making it impossible to sustain. Recently, the wages of workers in three industries, including smelting, machinery, and casting, are related to the rice issue. The employers have requested to change the calculation based on the cost of living index. After repeated mediation, it has not been resolved and is still in a stalemate. The reason for the recent weakness in rice prices in Xidi is that the farmers are unable to pay for the resettlement expenses of the conscripts from the four rural areas, so they have to borrow food or transport the food stored at home to the city for sale in order to pay. Therefore, the food supply in the summer and autumn of this year will inevitably become more panic due to the sale of most of the rice in the countryside. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.

### Deng Huamin Discusses the Reconstruction of the Southwest

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 16th Air Dispatch] Stepping into the magnificent building of the Tonghui Bank, we interviewed our friend from the financial community, Mr. Deng Huamin. The name Deng Huamin can be said to be not unfamiliar, because he is a senator, the newly appointed legislator of the Seventh District of Sichuan, and the chairman of Tongzhuan Industrial Bank, Sichuan Salt Company, and Chunmao Fa Wood Company. After graduating from the Hanover University of Technology in Germany, he returned to his home country and served as a professor at National Sichuan University. He then founded these businesses, from manager, general manager, to chairman, and reached his current position.

This young financier, of medium height, sturdy build, and ruddy complexion, does not appear particularly wealthy in his neat attire, but his simplicity and shrewdness are revealed in his actions and words. The reporter first inquired about his views on the reconstruction of the Southwest. He lowered his head and pondered seriously, and then said: "Speaking of the reconstruction of the Southwest, let's talk about a smaller area. I am from Sichuan, so let's talk about the construction of Sichuan. First of all, there are three basic problems: the first is the problem of fundraising, the second is the problem of construction focus, and the third is the problem of technical talent. Sichuan was originally a relatively backward economic area, and now all its industries and mines have developed to meet the needs of wartime, and have not grown slowly. Therefore, regardless of raw materials and markets, regardless of technology and talent, although it is a land of abundance and has abundant resources, it has not actually cultivated a self-reliant and autonomous foundation. Of course, we do not deny that there are some shortcomings in the industries and mines of Sichuan itself and in the surrounding economic environment. Building Sichuan is a major project, and it cannot be achieved by the efforts of one person or one place, but must be:

First, we must urge and assist the government to complete the great five-year construction plan.

Second, the government should support the excellent factories in Sichuan.

Third, the government should give preferential treatment to the factories that moved to Sichuan during the War of Resistance. For example, Japan's reparations to me have reached a concrete stage. Although the allocation numbers and allocation areas have not yet been officially announced, how to allocate them fairly and how to achieve practical results is a problem that our southwest industries and mines should and must pay attention to." Finally, he also mentioned that the United States launched a westward movement at one time. He said: "The reconstruction of Sichuan not only does not have the obstacles of the westward movement, but also has the superior conditions lacking in the westward movement, because human resources, material resources, and financial resources have the economic foundation of wartime, which is twice the result with half the effort."

### British Fear Scientific Backwardness and Fall to Third-Class Country: Dr. Shen Jiarui Returns to China to Talk

[Shenzhou News Agency] Dr. Shen Jiarui, a full-time researcher at the Institute of Zoology of the Peiping Research Institute, was invited by the British Council to go to England for inspection last September. Shen has completed his inspection and returned to Shanghai on the 20th of this month aboard the Huarui. According to Dr. Shen's conversation with reporters about his research and inspection experience in England, he went abroad last September and visited Portsmouth, Scotland, and other places. He also visited the Institute of Zoology, Institute of Oceanography, and Museum of various universities, and talked with experts from other countries and exchanged experiences, which was very beneficial. In Portsmouth, he studied the color-changing crustacean crabs at the Marine Biological Laboratory for a month. After that, in December, he was invited by the International Society of Biology to visit and study in Paris. This time when he returned to China, he brought back three large boxes of the latest zoology books, about thousands of copies. It is said that the British Labor Party government is implementing two major policies: (1) to do its best to solve domestic social problems, so that everyone can be employed, and the unemployed will receive subsidies; (2) to strive to increase production, step up the training of scientific talents, and support them, so that theoretical science and applied science are integrated. For example, the United Kingdom lacks meat, and it is trying its best to set up more fishing industry institutions on the coast, and the institute uses fish to supplement them. Artificial insemination is widely used to increase the number of dairy cows and increase milk production. Science students go to factories for internships, and the British government has specially increased the budget for scientific research. Dr. Shen said that the British are afraid that scientific backwardness will become a third-class country, so they pay special attention to advanced scientific research such as atomic energy and electron microscopes. Dr. Shen was also warmly welcomed and entertained in Hong Kong and Singapore. He is scheduled to return to Peiping at the end of the month and will preside over: (1) zoological classification work; (2) experimental zoology research work.

### Silver Market Tightens, Merchants Sluggish, Rice Prices Continue to Fall Yesterday, Civil Affairs Council Attempts to Sell Rice in the North Market but Finds No Bidders

[Our Report] Yesterday, the rice market experienced another round of tight credit. Prices in the production areas of Suzhou and Wuxi reported declines again, leading to a sharp drop in the local market. At the opening, prices fell by over ten thousand, and merchants were quite sluggish. Sellers had to lower prices to attract buyers. Later, prices for all types of rice reported small declines, further depressing market sentiment, creating a situation where supply exceeded demand. White japonica and early Ping rice in the North and South markets both fell by 200,000 yuan, with some prices falling by 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. White japonica rice in the North market was at 3.75 million yuan, thin rice at 3.65 million yuan, and special high-quality japonica also fell below the 4 million yuan mark. The total amount of rice arriving in the North and South markets was 7,275 stones.

Another Report: The Civil Affairs Council continued to sell large quantities of rice yesterday to suppress rising rice prices. Originally, early rice was scheduled to be sold in the North market, but because rice prices slightly decreased, the selling price was automatically lowered by 200,000 yuan to 3.4 million yuan. However, due to weak market sentiment, there were no bidders, and not a single grain of rice was sold. Since the Civil Food Allocation Council began comprehensive per capita rice rationing, it has never sold rice on the market. Recently, due to the prolonged storage of rice in warehouses and the arrival of 134 newly arrived shiploads of rice, some of which were not suitable for long-term storage, an inspection revealed that 1,235 stones were slightly damp. Therefore, the Council entrusted the North Rice Market Management Committee to sell this rice. However, due to the excessive drop in rice prices yesterday, the sale was temporarily unsuccessful. It is also understood that the rice rationed for April and June in this city will be entirely American relief rice. The rice rationed for May will be Siamese rice. According to the person in charge of the Council, the supply of grain exceeds demand, and plans are currently being drafted to directly protect sales and prevent a sharp drop in grain prices.

Flour sales were sluggish, and merchants were less inclined to buy. Amid continuous sales calls, the prices of all brands of flour fell to their limits. Lao Che and Bingshen flour each fell sharply by 115,000 yuan, while Hongfeng and Jiancheng flour also fell by 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour were quiet due to slow sales. At the close, Lao Che warehouse slips were at 1.475 million yuan, delivered at 1.49 million yuan, and Bingshen warehouse slips were at 1.46 million yuan. Large bags of bran fell below 800,000 yuan, a decrease of 75,000 yuan. Wheat factory disks were at 2.3 million yuan.

A wave of price declines swept across miscellaneous grains. Due to the preceding fall in rice prices, miscellaneous grains followed suit. Soybean merchants were not buying. Hankou Zhadou opened at 1.9 million yuan, but the Dachang New Oil Factory reduced the price to 1.85 million yuan at the close, with 300 bags traded, a decrease of 200,000 yuan. Although corn prices rose sharply the previous day, yesterday's decline was also severe, falling by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Red sorghum also fell by 200,000 yuan. Mung beans and sesame both fell by 200,000 yuan. Uncooked peanuts saw even less merchant interest, falling by another 300,000 to 400,000 yuan.

Edible oil prices plummeted, mainly because soybean and other miscellaneous grain prices all fell, causing market sentiment to be very weak. With credit tightening again, sellers had no choice but to lower prices to sell their goods. As the decline intensified, merchants became more cautious, and the market experienced a rapid downward spiral. Qingdao Ji bucket oil opened at 9.25 million yuan, then fell to 9.1 million yuan, a sharp drop of 500,000 yuan. Basket crude oil saw a few transactions at 8.65 million yuan. Dayou Factory opened with soybean oil at 7.65 million yuan, but returning goods quickly fell to 7.55 million yuan. Datong soybean oil opened at 7.6 million yuan, but returning goods were as low as 7.5 million yuan, each falling by 450,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil fell by 450,000 yuan. Raw vegetable oil initially fell by 300,000 yuan, and the market continued to decline. Small car sesame oil fell the least, at 300,000 yuan. Soybean cake merchants were not buying, and retail sellers were selling, lowering the price by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.

### Rumors of Advantageous Sales Rampant, Chinese Stocks Suddenly Rebound

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were initially weak and then stabilized due to short covering, with a strong rebound near noon. In the afternoon, there were rumors of advantageous sales both domestically and internationally, which ultimately led to a collapse, and the market became weak again. National banks saw significant declines, and the closing was even more unfavorable.

The morning opened flat and weak. Yong Yarn immediately traded at 1,805 yuan, with deferred delivery starting at a low price of 1,850 yuan. After buying at 1,820 yuan and 1,872 yuan, it retreated to 1,810 yuan and 1,855 yuan. It then rose again to 1,830 yuan and 1,885 yuan. Ultimately, due to many closing positions, the decline intensified, falling to 1,767 yuan and 1,818 yuan. It was then bought up and rose to 1,815 yuan and 1,870 yuan. At noon, spot and deferred delivery prices diverged further. Spot delivery stopped at 1,800 yuan, and deferred delivery rose to 1,890 yuan.

Spot and deferred delivery were then absorbed and rose to 1,850 yuan and 1,885 yuan. Although there was a brief recovery, the market became weak again due to rumors of President Zhang's resignation, coupled with a deficit of over 400 billion yuan in national banks, falling to 1,780 yuan and 1,805 yuan. The closing was 1,785 yuan and 1,810 yuan. Compared to the morning closing, spot delivery stocks Huochai, Rongfeng, Zhongsi, Yonggong, Jingfu, Qinxi, and Yiyi rose slightly, Huaxin and Shangwu were flat, and the rest fell slightly. Deferred delivery stocks all fell slightly. Among the unlisted stocks on the outside market, public utility stocks fell the most, by 5%.

Yesterday, public bonds were stable and steady, with limited fluctuations. Unified Class C opened at 100,800, with a high price remaining at 110,000 yuan, and a low price stopping at 100,500 yuan, before fluctuating. Approximately 4 million yuan was traded. Compared to the previous closing, Class A, B, D each rose by 1,000 yuan, and Class C and E remained flat.

Foreign stocks were pressured by tight credit. Banks sold off in large quantities. Securities firms bought after selling, and foreign firms also bought, but it was difficult to boost the market. Ewo Silk opened at 1.84 million, and the previous market was still stable, but only fell slightly to around 1.85 million. In the afternoon, it collapsed again, falling to around 1.73 million at the close.

The Shanghai Financial Management Bureau has been ordered to comply.

### Bank and Bureau Deficits, Credit Tightens Again

Yesterday, the credit crunch in this city was unprecedented. In the afternoon, this situation became even more intense. Underground interest rates in the market rose repeatedly.

If they fail to do so, interest will be calculated on overdue loans in accordance with the regulations issued by the Four Banks Joint Treasury. (2) Regarding the draft regulations for determining silkworm seed prices and approving seed loan methods, it was resolved to amend and approve them.

### Tea Market Firm and Stable

Since the strong buying interest in the tea market has continued to spread, the process has not slowed down at all. Unfortunately, the remaining stocks of each type of tea are still scarce, so trading remains limited due to the lack of supply.

In terms of prices, sellers wanted to raise prices again, but because tea prices had risen sharply and continuously, they felt powerless to raise them further. As a result, the market turned to a firm and stable trend. However, according to general opinion, because old tea is almost sold out and the production period for new tea is still far away, there is still hope for further progress in the future.

### Sugar and Coal Continued to Arrive

[Our Report] The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Zhe ship returned to Shanghai from Keelung yesterday, carrying over 1,400 tons of sugar, totaling over 14,990 bags, which is now being unloaded at the Jinliyuan Wharf.

Dahua Tobacco Company also distributed "20-pack Baoerkang" cigarettes, with a distribution price of 130,000 yuan per carton. Also, "Jipuka" cigarettes were at 100,000 yuan per carton.

At noon closing, the street saw low purchases, and buying interest was quite strong, with prices recovering slightly.

### Credit Still Tight, Sales Sluggish, Cotton Yarn and Fabric Prices Fall Again, 42-count Blue Phoenix Continues to Fall by 6 Million Yuan

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was characterized by tight credit. Customers in Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions remained sluggish. The local market adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The morning opened with a chorus of sellers. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately broke through the 200 million yuan mark, falling to 195 million yuan. Subsequently, small-scale replenishments by reproduction manufacturers and opportunists who saw slight gains came to take advantage of the situation and actively pushed prices up, and the market regained momentum. By the time of the close, bulls sold off to take profits, closing at 200.4 million yuan, a continued drop of 6 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Around 10 o'clock, all parties' positions became tighter, and frequent high-price sales occurred. It was also learned that the Yarn Management Committee swapped flowers for yarn, and manufacturers hoped for raw cotton, and each sold out, and the market's chips suddenly felt abundant, and each fabric fell rapidly. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell into the 4 million yuan mark, and even more scattered sales fell directly to 3.88 million. Near the close, fabric merchants saw low prices and absorbed them, returning to 3.96 million yuan, a sharp drop of 380,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

At the same time, Dacheng Company distributed "Guben" soap, with an allocated price of 5.8 million yuan per carton. Large customers took the opportunity to lower prices, and the market fell straight down. By the end, Guben soap fell by 70,000 to 80,000, closing at 5.88 million yuan.

### Domestic Opening of Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Has No Impact on Hong Kong Market

Hong Kong News, Regarding the opening of self-provided foreign exchange, local sources have received news from Shanghai that the General Transportation Management Council will hold a regular committee meeting in Shanghai, and Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun will also go to Shanghai to participate. The main purpose of the meeting is to discuss the partial opening of self-provided foreign exchange in order to use the deposits of Chinese people abroad and facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese to import production equipment and industrial raw materials and chemical products needed in the country. The main method is to use the deposits of Chinese people abroad and guide the escape of funds abroad to increase domestic production. However, it is stipulated that this self-provided foreign exchange is limited to foreign deposits before the end of December last year in order to prevent capital outflow and disrupt the financial market. Detailed measures are still being drafted. Yesterday, reporters asked local commercial leaders about this issue. According to their opinions, the import of self-provided foreign exchange will have no practical benefit to the Hong Kong market. Because the so-called self-provided foreign exchange has approximately the following two sources: (1) Overseas remittances (excluding Hong Kong) (2) Export exchange settlement. In terms of overseas remittances, overseas Chinese, especially US remittances, mostly remit US dollar checks directly back to Taiwan, and then transfer them to Hong Kong for storage. They have no confidence in either national currency or Hong Kong dollars, so it is doubtful whether encouraging overseas remittances to import production equipment will achieve the desired effect in the future. Moreover, Shanghai news said that it is limited to foreign deposits before the end of December last year, and there are many troubles in proving it. As for export exchange settlement, 20% is sold to the government, and 70% is freely allocated by merchants.

### Agricultural Loans to Start Next Week, Shanghai Agricultural Bank's Annual Quota Approximately 1.1 Trillion

The Farmers Bank's administrative meeting closed on the 22nd. It is reported that the results of this meeting were very satisfactory. Loan methods and technical issues have been resolved. The total amount of loans for this month was decided to be 1.475 trillion. The quotas for each branch have already been allocated in part. Those that have not been allocated will be further discussed by the managers of each branch with the Agricultural Loan Department after the meeting to suit the needs of each region. Fertilizers and seeds will be provided in kind, and the rest will be provided in cash in principle. In addition, in order to control materials on behalf of the government, agricultural warehouses will be established in grain and cotton production areas to handle the storage and pledge of agricultural products. The interest rate for agricultural loans is set at 7% per month, and loan procedures will be simplified as much as possible. Li Shuming, General Manager of the Bank, believes that agricultural loans cannot be delayed any longer because spring plowing is imminent. He took a train to Shanghai on the evening of the 22nd to discuss mortgage transfers with the Central Bank. It has been decided that the bank will raise 10% of the head office, and 90% will be transferred by the Central Bank. Once the contract is signed, funds can be allocated. Each branch of the Farmers Bank will start lending next week.

[Another News] The allocation of agricultural loans for the Shanghai area for this year between the China Farmers Bank and the China Cooperative Treasury has been roughly allocated. The China Agricultural Shanghai Bank is approximately 1.1 trillion yuan, and the China Cooperative Treasury is approximately 600 billion yuan. Among them, grain and cotton are the main ones, accounting for approximately 70%. The Shanghai Bank has decided to convene the heads of its branch offices on Saturday to discuss and decide on the implementation measures for approval and the distribution of loan amounts in various regions in order to follow the decisions of the administrative meeting and start approval next week.

### 11th Round of Taiwan Sugar Allocation Prices Determined

The Municipal Industry Assistance Office and other departments have decided to send representatives carrying this information to Beijing by overnight train last night to participate.

### Banks Believe That the Joint Liability of the Introducer of Check Accounts Is Difficult to Comply With

[Our Report] The Shanghai Bank Commercial Industry Association convened a meeting of the standing council yesterday, chaired by Li Ming. The following important cases were discussed and approved: (1) According to banking law, half of the deposit guarantee reserve can be offset by bonds, etc. It was decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to allow this. (2) The Ministry of Finance stipulates that the business income tax for profit-making enterprises should be collected at six times the amount levied last year. However, the operating income of the financial industry has not increased six times compared to last year, and it was decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to require collection based on the actual amount collected in the account. (3) Regarding the guarantee responsibility that the introducer of the check user should bear, according to the Financial Management Bureau's explanation, he should bear the responsibility of determining the identity and address of the check user. If the check user has any illegal activities, he should bear the joint responsibility. The industry believes that this is difficult to comply with.

### Shanghai Enamel Industry Requests Reduction in Antimony White Allocation Price

The Shanghai enamel industry has recently experienced a decline in production and sales and a bleak future due to the lack of imported raw materials and the small number of quota allocations. The soaring allocation prices of domestic pure antimony and antimony white are also affecting exports. A special presentation was made to the Resources Committee requesting a special reduction and an increase in allocation to maintain production. The original presentation stated that pure antimony is an essential chemical raw material for the enamel industry, and the factories under the association need more than 40 tons per month. Since the start of allocation in August last year, half of the allocation was initially received, and the price was 7.5 million yuan per ton. After several requests, a quarter of the allocation was received for the second time in November, and the price had soared to 35 million yuan. Within two months, the allocation price for the third time increased to 46 million yuan. By the time of the fourth allocation on February 16th recently, it suddenly soared to 73 million yuan. During these six months, the first allocation price was ten times higher than the fourth. Although the fifth allocation has not yet been distributed, it is said that the price will soar even more shockingly, reaching more than 100 million yuan. However, during the same period, the selling price of finished enamel products has increased by less than three times, and the huge losses can be imagined. A review of the amount of pure antimony allocated four times shows that it only accounts for one-fifth of the actual amount required. The Foreign Trade Office's letter stated that regarding the pure antimony needed by the enamel industry, the sale of antimony white should be gradually changed, urging each factory to strive for improvement. When the antimony white allocation price is higher than pure antimony, it is not enough to show encouragement. If the allocation can be reduced, each factory should be advised to purchase a trial, etc. After the letter was replied, there has been no news so far, and the sound of another price increase is coming one after another. The factories all believe that changing to antimony white is dark and affects the beauty of the finished product. And the amount used is 30% more than pure antimony, although a little Chilean nitrate can be used less, but the nitrate price is lower, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. In terms of production, pure antimony is used to formulate enamel powder, which can produce more than 200 pounds per day, while antimony white can only produce less than 180 pounds. Therefore, the result will increase the cost of the product and block the way to foreign sales. It is requested that the antimony white allocation price be specially reduced, at least by 30% from the February price, in order to facilitate improvement. In the next allocation of pure antimony, please also increase the quantity and maintain the original price of the last time, do not soar again, in order to maintain production and benefit exports.

Literature

### Drama and Literature

—

Engaging in drama requires a rich literary cultivation because drama is inseparable from literature. We know that the main branches of literature are poetry, prose, fiction, and drama; drama originally belongs to a branch of literature, but drama also assimilates other branches of literature; because drama itself is composed of poetry, prose, and fiction, drama presents poetry, prose, and fiction in three dimensions, so drama can be called a comprehensive art, and also a comprehensive literature.

Drama, whether musical or spoken, has a close relationship with poetry. Poetry can not only independently constitute a musical drama, but also embellish or regulate the atmosphere of a spoken drama, such as an interlude. Shakespeare used poetry to write dialogue. Early Chinese spoken dramas, like Tian Han's "Suzhou Night Talk," not only had dialogue that was poetry, but even the plot and atmosphere were poetic.

Prose is the same; prose can be used in the dialogue and artistic conception of drama. Prose is a literary style that emphasizes the beauty of words and the beauty of emotions, so a person who writes prose well will definitely write beautiful dialogue for dramas, and will definitely create subtle settings and atmosphere.

Fiction and drama are even more closely linked. A novel can be transformed into a drama because both novels and dramas have dialogue, plot, characters, and action. The difference lies only in the fact that drama is presented in a prominent way, while novels are depicted on a flat surface. With a foundation in writing novels, it is much easier to write dramas.

The above is about how drama creators must have literary cultivation, and the same is true for drama directors and actors. Because literature can help you increase your understanding, understanding how a line should be read to be harmonious; how a character's personality should be expressed to be emotional and flexible; how a plot should be interspersed to be appropriate and reasonable.

A playwright with literary cultivation creates dramas that are not only scripts suitable for performance, but also literary works that can be read. A director with literary cultivation inevitably rehearses dramas with a high artistic style. An actor with literary cultivation inevitably performs dramas without affectedness or artificiality.

Therefore, all drama workers must have considerable literary cultivation, even those who work on scenery, effects, and lighting. Because literature can help you understand how a set should be set up to coordinate with the plot; how an effect should be used to enrich emotions; how a light should be emitted to match the atmosphere.

As for how to cultivate literary cultivation, in addition to fully reading literary books, a playwright must especially engage in literary creation.

Reading literary books should not be done with a recreational mentality, nor should it be interrupted. One must sincerely, consistently, and even systematically appreciate the works of each era, each movement, and each author. After appreciating the good and bad of the works, then use a research attitude to analyze the works and analyze the author. Finally, one should strictly criticize, because criticizing other people's works is tantamount to warning oneself and encouraging oneself. Based on this reading spirit, one can not only directly help increase literary cultivation, but also raise a strong interest in writing.

To become an excellent playwright, it is best to experiment with writing literary works in various genres, such as poetry, prose, and fiction. Especially write more novels. Writing short stories lays the foundation for writing one-act plays because short stories have simple plots that can be turned into one-act plays. Writing long novels lays the foundation for writing multi-act plays because long novels have complex plots that can be turned into multi-act plays. Although novels and dramas have different forms, their essence is actually the same.

Of course, we cannot absolutely say that a drama worker cannot succeed without literary cultivation; he can succeed by relying on technical proficiency. However, dramas that succeed solely on technology ultimately lack flavor and substance. If literature is given equal importance with technology, then it can not only supplement the poverty of flavor, but also increase the weight of substance. Especially dramatic writing requires the edification of various branches of literature, and is also a successful combination of various branches of literature. Therefore, we dare to say absolutely that a playwright must have full literary cultivation.

### Song of the Earth

— Qing Guo

Road

Road of red earth, road of yellow earth.

Red, yellow, the healthy arms of the earth!

The road embraces the earth, embraces the mountains, forests, villages, towns...

The road extends to the distance, shaking hands with our hardworking friends; the road extends abroad, shaking hands with our dear neighbors.

The road also leads back here, spreading many beautiful things and valuable news everywhere, like scattering seeds...

Pagoda

Pagoda—

Like a strong will placed in the heart, the pagoda stands strong in the wilderness.

Many years have fallen from the top of the pagoda and shattered; many nebulae have fallen from the top of the pagoda and shattered. But the pagoda is not sentimental, always coldly shaking the rusty bell filled with wind and rain, letting the clear, distant, lonely and proud sound resonate throughout the wilderness.

Thus, the earth's dream awakens, and the earth has a strong will.

Bridge

Bridge, of wisdom.

Where there is a bridge, there is no foolishness. The bridge is a measure of culture.

In the sky, there is a rainbow of colored light, spanning the clear sky. I remember people saying that when the rainbow appears, it will not rain again.

On the ground, there is a bridge, spanning the living, flowing water. I know: when there is a bridge, the wisdom between people is connected.

Ah! Bridge, the wisdom of the earth!

Illustrated Collection of Grimm's Fairy Tales

Ms. Wanda Gág passed away in June 1946, leaving behind her "More Tales from Grimm."

Children are very familiar with her because they are used to seeing the cats and rabbits she drew. Children wholeheartedly love the books she illustrated, and then pass them on to other children; in this way, she is immortal!

Zigrosser's preface says that she "completed this work only after painful endurance before this book was published." Her illustrations do not follow the predecessors, they are her own creations. Just looking at the famous "The Elves and the Shoemaker" attached here, you can know. These illustrations are extremely imaginative and humorous.

Her "Tales from Grimm" was published eleven years ago. This "More Tales" has only one relatively unfamiliar story, "The Dragon and His Grandmother." The others are well-known to boys and girls and can touch the memories and joys of children of any age. Among them are the German versions of "Sleeping Beauty" and "The Six Swans," Marie Sherlock's retelling of "The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats" (this retelling once made middle-aged people laugh in the United States), and "Clever Hans," a lovely story, and the German version of "The Shepherd's Nosegay."

Lagerlöf's Fairy Tales

The fairy tale "The Wonderful Adventures of Nils" by Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf has recently been translated into English.

This book is a natural science research material provided to children in Swedish elementary schools. Few school textbooks are as popular as this book. This book was written in 1903 and published three years later. It contains hundreds of illustrations, which are especially valuable.

Nils is a naughty child. He is already fourteen years old, does not like to study, has a bad heart, and is especially cruel to animals. Therefore, a goblin turns him into a goblin, smaller than the small animals he has abused. Now he must be pitied by the small animals! He passes through the fields, castles, cities, buildings, etc. of various parts of Sweden. At this time, he understands the life of forest animals and also understands how to be a person. Finally, he is willing to sacrifice for the birds, and because of his kindness, he is transformed back into a human being.

This story is expressed in the form of comic strips. This book benefits both the eyes and the mind.

This book is published by Pantheon Books, which publishes a famous children's literature work every year. In the past, it has published stories and legends from Germany, the Soviet Union, and Greece. This one published this year is also something we are eager to read.

The illustrations are drawn by Hans Baumhauer. The one attached here is of little Nils being beaten.

### Characteristics of Qing Dynasty Painting

— Yu Jianhua

— And Wishing the 37th Art Festival in Advance

(1) Division of the Era

In history, the Qing Dynasty began in the first year of Shunzhi (1644) and ended in the third year of Xuantong (1911), totaling 367 years, which can be considered an independent era. However, in the history of painting, in terms of the changes in the schools and the shift in painting styles, the period from the Longqing and Wanli periods of the Ming Dynasty to the 25th year of Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty should be regarded as an era, because the mainstream of painting in this era was landscape painting, and the style of landscape painting completely inherited Dong Qichang's method and did not change until the middle of the Qing Dynasty. During the transition between the Ming and Qing Dynasties, although there were many eccentric geniuses in the painting world who transcended the influence of the Dong school, such as Shitao, Shixi, Bada, Banqian, Qushan, and Jianjiang, although they each occupied a territory and had considerable influence at the time, they were only like warlords who were divided and soon disappeared, with no successors and not widespread. After Dong Qichang, the so-called Six Masters of the Qing Dynasty, the Four Wangs and Wu Yun, all inherited Dong's method, developed it greatly, and created a unified situation in the painting world. Therefore, when people talk about Qing Dynasty painting, they often attribute Shitao, Bada, and others to the Ming Dynasty loyalists, and take the Four Wangs and Wu Yun as representatives of the Qing Dynasty. Among them, the Lou Dong and Yushan schools flourished especially, and lasted throughout the Qing Dynasty's period of peace and prosperity. After Daoguang and Xianfeng, the Qing Dynasty had many misfortunes and the national power gradually declined, and the Four Wangs and Wu Yun's school also declined with it. The Qing Dynasty had not yet perished, but the Four Wangs' school had already perished. Even if there were artists, they were equal to old loyalists, insignificant.

(2) The Source of Qing Painting

The Six Masters, the Four Wangs and Wu Yun, all inherited Dong Qichang's style and dominated the Qing Dynasty, so Dong Qichang can be said to be the father of Qing Dynasty painting. Among them, the Six Masters also had slight differences. Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, and Wang Yuanqi can be said to be biological sons (this is based on the style; in reality, Wang Yuanqi was Wang Shimin's grandson), while Wang Shigu and Yun Nantian can be said to be cousins, and Wu Mojing can be said to be a distant cousin. So who was Dong Qichang's father? That was Huang Gongwang, one of the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty. After the Four Masters of Wen, Shen, Tang, and Qiu were at their peak, Dong Qichang specialized in learning from Huang Gongwang through Gu Zhengyi's introduction, and also incorporated the ink methods of his distant ancestors Mi Nan Gong and Dong Beiyuan, forming a unique style that was warm, elegant, and refined. The Three Wangs inherited it, and then made a living from Huang Gongwang. Luntai never dared to step out of Huang Gongwang's range in his life. The influence of this style spread so widely that it became "everyone a peak" and "every family a Dachi," thinking that there was no painting outside of Huang Gongwang, and that the paintings outside of Huang Gongwang were all heretical and absolutely unlearnable. Therefore, the painting world for more than 400 years from Longqing to the late Qing Dynasty can also be called the "Huang Gongwang Era."

(3) Political Influence

The Manchus entered the Pass and unified China. Although their military power was strong, their culture was immature. The codes and systems mostly followed the Ming Dynasty's norms. By the Kangxi and Qianlong eras, they encouraged literature, rectified politics, and launched eastern and western expeditions, greatly enhancing their power and creating the Qing Dynasty's golden age. In order to block thoughts and win people's hearts, the government summoned learned elders and compiled large books such as the "Siku Quanshu." Over a century, with political clarity and social tranquility, talented scholars gradually forgot the pain of national subjugation and lived happily under the peaceful culture. Therefore, all poetry, calligraphy, and painting strived for purity and harmony. As for promoting vigor, uniqueness, and stimulating styles, they gradually softened and became invisible. In addition, the emperors, such as Kangxi and Qianlong, were all fond of calligraphy and painting. Even Emperors Renzong, Xuanzong, and Wenzong, although in an era of domestic and foreign troubles, often lingered in calligraphy and painting in their spare time. The upper echelons set an example, and the atmosphere spread, so for a time, social customs all engaged in writing and painting in order to attach themselves to elegance. The number of painters was the greatest in history. Since the emperors liked painting, although there was no painting academy, there were titles such as Inner Court Attendants and Ruyi Pavilion to treat painters favorably. Since those above liked it deeply and advocated it vigorously, most painters, even if they did not intend to curry favor, could become famous for a time if they won the emperor's appreciation. Therefore, some people inevitably flocked to it. Even ordinary literati and scholars mostly wielded their pens and ink to cater to the emperor's favor and advance their careers. Emperor Kangxi especially liked Dong Qichang's calligraphy and painting, and collected them throughout the country, inscribed jade tablets and gold titles, and attached great importance to them. Wang Yuanqi inherited his family's learning and became a Minister of Agriculture. He was especially known to Emperor Kangxi and served as the director of the Painting and Calligraphy Manual Hall and the chief painter of the Southern Tour Map. Therefore, those who studied painting competed to go to his door, forming the so-called Lou Dong School, which opposed the Yushan School. Yuanqi devoted his life to studying Huang Gongwang, and those who learned from him did not dare to change him slightly. Therefore, Yuanqi's students spread all over the world, and Huang Gongwang's method also spread all over the painting world.

(4) Revival of Thought

Ming Dynasty loyalists such as Gu Yanwu criticized the formalism and the emptiness and uselessness of ancient studies. They vigorously advocated the theory of application to the world, cited the ancient to prove the present, and thus started the trend of textual research. The early Qing Dynasty emperors also used this kind of learning that exhausted the mind and forgot the present to consume and isolate the intelligence and talent of scholars. Therefore, for a time, the court and the public all advocated the Han learning of textual research and annotation, replacing the Song learning of idealism and taking the lead in the academic world. Because of the rise of the archaeological trend, the revival of ancient thought also developed greatly. It was believed that everything in the world was good if it was ancient, and the more ancient, the better. Literati and scholars, influenced by this academic atmosphere, when engaged in painting, naturally only revered the ancient. They did not dare to be clever, did not dare to express their own ideas, and did not dare to show novelty. They only worshipped the ancients and imitated the established methods. As long as it resembled ancient paintings, they were already complacent, pretending to be content with being able to get "the ancient people's foot odor" or being able to "breathe out of one nostril with the ancients." The atmosphere of copying and imitating permeated the national painting world. There was no method outside of copying and imitating, and no painting outside of copying and imitating. As a result, it became a process of "successive inheritance," "each time worse than the last," withered, empty, mediocre, and stale, creating the incurable disease of Qing painting.

(5) Schools of Flower and Bird Painting

The main schools of Qing Dynasty landscape painting are nothing more than Wang Yuanqi's Lou Dong School and Wang Shigu's Yushan School. As for flower and bird painting, it is not as simple as the schools of landscape painting. Although the influence of Qing Dynasty flower and bird painting is not as great as that of landscape painting, it is more vibrant than other paintings, such as Daoist and Buddhist figures. (1) Sketching from life—sketching flowers from life, without the need for drafts, learning from Zhao Chang's and Yi Yuanji's sketching methods. Although there are dozens of people in this school, there are no famous masters, so the influence is not very great. (2) Wang Wu—stable in position and bright in color, quite admired in the early Qing Dynasty. (3) Yun Nantian—an outstanding talent, considering the past and present, taking the Northern Song Dynasty's Xu Chongsi as the ancestor and creating a pure boneless style, elegant and refined, meticulous and gorgeous, with both lively posture and rich charm and scholarly interest. It became the orthodox school of flower painting, with a large number of scholars, known as the Changzhou School, which is the main school of Qing Dynasty flower painting. (4) Jiang Tingxi—has the title of Nansha School, his brush and ink are more heavy and regular than Nantian's, either strange or upright, either colored or ink-washed, all can be integrated naturally. His official rank is also high, and there are many disciples, who can compete with Nantian. (5) Zou Yigui—the colors are bright and clean, the brush and ink are elegant, welcoming the wind and containing dew, graceful and lifelike, is the only famous master seen after Nantian. (6) Outline flower and dot leaf school—this school was originally created by Zhou Zhimian of the Ming Dynasty, between meticulous brushwork and freehand brushwork. The semi-meticulous and semi-freehand paintings of the Qing Dynasty include Sun Kehong, Zhang Ruoai, etc. (7) Freehand school—this school came from the ink freehand style of Lin Liang, Xu Wei, and Chen Chun of the Ming Dynasty. (8) The Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou—such as Jin Nong, Luo Pin, Gao Fenghan, Li Shan, Huang Shen, Zheng Xie, etc., became commoners or petty officials, each pursuing his own strangeness and opening up new aspects. Although they are not all flower painters, they all have the same tendency. At that time, they were called eccentric because their styles were different from the orthodox school of the Four Wangs. Now, looking at his paintings, he no longer feels strange. (9) Hua Yan—with his unrestrained and unrestrained brushwork and clear and elegant atmosphere, he became the master of flower and bird painting in the late Qing Dynasty. However, his brush strength is inevitably too soft, and those who learn from him tend to be thin and soft. Zhao Ziyi, Wu Ting, etc. used heavy brushwork to save it. At the extreme, it turned into Wu Junqing's roughness, and the Qing Dynasty was already over.

(6) The Rise of Different Forces

(A) Landscape painters—in the heyday of the Qing Dynasty, all the masters were skilled in copying and imitating, and the scholars followed suit, and did not dare to be different. Although there were one or two outstanding talents who sketched from real scenery, they were not valued by the world. Therefore, there are many stones and Zhang, but the history of painting contains quite a few people. For example, Fang Xianting's footprints almost covered the world, and what he saw was nothing but a powder book. Huang Ding read all the famous mountains in the world, and his method was to truly write about Huangshan. Hong Ran wrote about Tiantai Yandang, and Dai Benxiao painted Huashan. Huang Wenjian, a filial son, traveled thousands of miles to find his relatives, experienced the wildness, and captured all the strange scenery and strange peaks in his pen, which was especially outstanding. (B) Finger painting—Gao Qipei used his fingers instead of brushes to paint, and his flowers and figures were painted at will, creating a unique style in the painting world, and there were many scholars. (C) Western painting—the eastward spread of Western painting began in the Ming Dynasty, but the arrival of Western painters Lang Shining and Ai Qicha in the East had a great influence. They used meticulous and realistic Western methods to create eclectic Chinese paintings. For a time, there were many scholars, such as Jiao Bingzhen, Leng Mei, Tang Dai, Chen Mei, Luo Fumin, Ding Yuantai, Zhang Shu, etc., who were all known for their Western methods. Although this style of painting was popular for a while, it soon declined. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China that Western painting began to rise again, but it was completely different from the painting of Lang Shining's era.

(7) Conclusion

The Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office held an exhibition of Qing Dynasty paintings, coinciding with the opening of this Art Festival, and this short article is written to mark the celebration. (February 29, 1948)

### Wang Shimin's Light Green Landscape (One of the exhibits in the Qing Dynasty Painting Exhibition)

### Visiting Song Dynasty Flower and Bird Paintings

— Hu Ying

### Qing Dynasty Painting Exhibition

— Lu Danlin

Last autumn, the Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office held an "Exhibition of Paintings by Deceased Masters of the Past Century." Many visitors felt that it was a very meaningful art exhibition in recent years. After the closing, the colleagues immediately continued to prepare the Qing Dynasty Painting Exhibition. These two painting exhibitions are epoch-making, especially the Qing Dynasty Painting Exhibition. Its space and time are twice as large as the "Centennial Painting Exhibition." The period is from the early Qing Dynasty to Daoguang, and the authors are not limited to whether they resided in Shanghai, so its scope is relatively broad, and undoubtedly, its works are richer than before.

In Qing Dynasty painting, in addition to a part of the late period that has been displayed in the "Centennial Painting Exhibition" and will not be repeated, the schools worth mentioning include the Eight Masters of Jinling: Gong Xian, Fan Qi, Gao Cen, Zou Zhe, Wu Hong, Ye Xin, Hu Zao, and Xie Sun; and the Four Masters of Haiyang: Zha Shibiao, Sun Yi, Wang Zhirui, and Hong Ren. The Nine Friends in Painting include Dong Qichang, Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Li Liufang, Yang Wenzhao, Cheng Jiasui, Zhang Xuezeng, Bian Wenyu, and Shao Mi. Among the Nine Friends in Painting, there are also the Six Masters of Landscape, namely Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Hui, Wang Yuanqi, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping. Wang Yuanqi also established the Lou Dong School, and Wang Hui the Yushan School. The two schools stand side by side, each with its own characteristics. The landscape painters after Qianlong and Jiaqing to the present are mostly within the scope of these two schools, and their power can be said to be broad and strong. The Ten Philosophers of Painting include Dong Bangda, Zhang Zhao, Li Shizhuo, Wang Yunxi, Gao Xiang, Gao Fenghan, Li Shizhong, Wang Yange, Zhang Shiying, and Chen Jiale. The Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou include Jin Nong, Luo Pin, Zheng Xie, Li Shan, Wang Shishen, Li Fangying, and Gao Xiang. (There are also those who add or subtract Min Zhen, Gao Fenghan, and others.) Others include the Su Song School, the Hua Shi School, the Yunjian School, the Xin'an School, the Jiangxi School, etc., each with its own territory. There are also those who specialize in one art, such as those who disdain copying and specializing in green and blue, imitating Jing Hao and Guan Tong, copying Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasty Daoist and Buddhist figures, figure portraits, flower, bird, grass, insect, and animal paintings, etc., each searching for its best during this period. Except for the Ren Yi and Wu Junqing schools of the late Qing Dynasty and the Lingnan School, the various schools of Qing Dynasty painting are the most brilliant, connecting the works of the Centennial Painting Exhibition, which can be appreciated and studied as an epoch-making event. From this, it is also possible to trace the remaining charm of the Yuan and Ming paintings, the origin of the Shanghai School painting, and the origins and evolution of various schools and families. These can all be appreciated and appreciated in this painting exhibition. And in some works, we can see the Qing government's advocacy of civil governance, promotion of painting, and use of titles such as Inner Court Attendants and Inner Court Waiters to win over painters. And some painters also flattered, and in the pursuit of fame and fortune, they did not hesitate to lower their ambitions and humiliate themselves, wielding their brushes and ink to win "imperial appreciation." Those recorded in the Shiqu Baoji are mostly not painting experts, but literati and officials who are fond of fame and fortune. Therefore, by appreciating historical art, it is also possible to explore the thoughts and character of people in a certain era and a certain class.

### Passing the Guan Di Temple

— Li Qifeng

Frontier Grass

In childhood days I loved the blue sky

Never said there was verdant entanglement with me

Coming the evening of river maples and fishing lights

Carrying hope and holding the fire of youth

I loved the excessive sorrow of dawn at Yin hour

Hated the homesickness so much when the flowers fell

Dreams become desolate rubble fields

Do you have the heart to say it's a lucky mound?

I think it's that I'm tired of the bitter red dust

Ancient roads and desolate mountains easily stir sorrow

External things are sails and sand birds

(Young people, don't practice with your hair uncut)

When will you finish enduring yellow sutras and green lamps?

Spider silk dragon covers the stories of the previous dynasty

The smoke and dust of the Han family drifts away cleanly

Can the Old Master endure the wind and rain of his wife?

Bao Dao falls to the ground, Zhou Cang is afraid of fatigue

Who believes that the Old Master is melancholy and loves?

Don't you see the bright lamps and incense in front of the hall

A stick of mirror sound shakes thousands of autumns

Smart people, will you also have this result?

Dreams hold up the mountain mist, empty and desolate

Iron horses lightly jingle, crows and sparrows fly in groups

I hope white clouds and flowing water will be quiet soon

I return the evening of river maples and fishing lights

(Sent from Shenyang)

### Meteor

— Song Ping

At night, a meteor, deftly劃過天海,

The consciousness of life: cherish and be vigilant.

Perhaps, that was also a world, and there had been mankind,

In an instant, causing eternal silence and destruction

Who can say that our world is bigger than that eternally消失了的?

Why should we be more intelligent than the humans of that world?

This vast sea of the universe is full of beautiful stars

Eventually, the destination must be a long rest.

Our world is just the dust of dust in the sea,

We live in the dust of dust, seeking.

Disturbances, pain, eroding the short lives of most humans,

The longed-for quiet and peace, unless all mankind rests.

But that terrible moment will come before humanity reappears.

Will humans on other worlds sigh for our陨落?

(1947·July·Pingliang stormy night)

### Self-Portrait

— Gong Liu

Looking at the eyes, I know you have insomnia,

From insomnia, I guess what you are thinking about...

The eyebrows have lost their former vigor,

It seems that melancholy has伤 your youth.

But the iron jaw is still tightly biting a determination,

And that determination is biting the enemy tightly.

### Preface to the Exhibition of Famous Paintings from the Qing Dynasty in China

— Li Ximou

Looking back to ancient times, the purpose of painting was primarily practical, with aesthetics being secondary. During the Xia, Shang, Zhou dynasties, and the Qin and Han dynasties, painting was often used to decorate objects and to promote education. In the late Han and the Six Dynasties periods, Chinese painting was influenced by Indian Buddhist paintings, resulting in brilliant religious paintings. Descending to the prosperous Tang dynasty, with the rise of Lao-Zhuang philosophy, Buddhism, and poetry, painting shifted its focus to brushwork, ink, and the pursuit of spirit and rhythm, pioneering the style of literati painting. By the Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan dynasties, artists strived for freehand expression, and masterpieces often depicted landscapes. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, imitation became prevalent, coexisting with literati painting.

During the Qing dynasty, due to the advocacy of painting, many talented artists within the country devoted themselves to calligraphy and painting, serving the court. At that time, prime ministers and attendants who were favored for their painting skills were not uncommon. Their influence was widespread, and the prosperity of painting rivaled that of previous dynasties. The most prominent schools of painting included the Xin'an School of Zhejiang, the Jiangxi School of Luo Shouzhi, the Suzhou School of Chi Mu, the Loudong School of Wang Yuanqi, and the Yushan School, which was derived from the Loudong School and dominated the latter half of the Qing dynasty. Other notable schools included the Huating School of Dong Qichang and the Songjiang School of Zhao Wenmin. Among these schools, those that emphasized reviving ancient styles produced paintings that were gentle and serene, while those that emphasized innovation created paintings that were fresh and unrestrained. In particular, the Ming dynasty loyalists, seeking alternative paths, expressed their resentment towards the country and family in their brushwork, creating a unique style in Qing dynasty painting, which had a significant impact on later generations.

Throughout history, the most valuable paintings were those collected in the imperial court. The Qing dynasty especially expanded its collection, as evidenced by the calligraphy and painting catalogs of the Department of Palace Affairs. At that time, countless officials and gentry families collected ancient paintings, but they were often hidden and kept as private possessions, preventing the public from studying these works of art, which were essential to the nation's culture, causing cultural stagnation. Now, with the advancement of science, distances between people have been shortened due to convenient transportation, and ancient artifacts can be easily distributed through improved printing technology. Various academic fields are flourishing, benefiting both individuals and society. Since the early Republic of China, with the promotion by the government and the support of local people, paintings have had the opportunity to be publicly exhibited, allowing enthusiasts to appreciate and study them, thus reviving the almost extinct art.

The Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Art Museum previously held a painting exhibition of the past century, which was well-received by the public. Now, tracing back to the source, they are holding a Qing dynasty painting exhibition, aiming to promote painting and art education, in order to rectify the decadent social customs and usher in a new era of culture. And since Shanghai is the gateway for international cultural exchange, showcasing Chinese art to international audiences has a significance that goes beyond merely promoting art!

### Viewing Liu Kaiqu's Bas-Relief

— Lü Di

Braving the piercing wind and dense snow, I arrived at the home of the sculptor, brother Liu Kaiqu.

In a somewhat damp sitting room, furnished with a few old rattan chairs, hung a newly created bas-relief, more than two feet long. Light from the low window slanted across the artwork, bringing the shallow undulations to life. It depicted the spring sunlight, gently illuminating the fields; farmers, in groups, busy tilling the land, renewing the earth, and clothing it in a lush green garment.

Spring, as the artwork tells us, brings new hope to the farmers. They dedicate their entire minds, all their labor, and all their money, even resorting to borrowing, to cultivate, sow, and nurture. During the day, they keep a watchful eye; at night, they dream of a bountiful year, filled with food and clothing.

Hope, hope. These most virtuous Chinese farmers, who endure what others cannot endure, and suffer what others can no longer suffer, toil year after year, yet their fate grows more tragic day by day. They cannot till the land, they cannot live in their homes, their wives are separated from their children, and tens of thousands are on the brink of death.

The artist, with his refined skill and the heart of a farmer's son (Kaiqu was born into a farming family), depicts the labor of farmers, making it exceptionally intimate, authentic, and moving. Those plowing the fields, those planting rice, those three women with a child – simple, unadorned, earnest – reminded me of the farmers I saw and lived with during the ten years of upheaval and wandering in the rural areas of various provinces. I thought of the refugees I saw just now on the street, gaunt and emaciated in the cold wind and heavy snow, their bodies barely covered, begging for food. Aren't they precisely the people celebrated in this bas-relief? Thinking of this, my heart felt truly heavy.

Brother Kaiqu told me that he plans to create four such bas-reliefs, depicting his childhood experiences in the countryside, tending to mountains, cutting grass, feeding cattle and herding sheep, and the year-round labor of the farmers he witnessed. This is a subject matter that Chinese art, especially sculptural art, has traditionally avoided, but it is precisely where Chinese art can find new development. I agreed with his opinion. I feel that artists can no longer be concerned solely with romantic scenery or entertaining high officials and wealthy people. For the sake of their art, for the sake of the nation and the people, they should face reality and earnestly speak for the majority of people, especially for the farmers.

### Earthworms

— Boyong

After a spring rain, with the sun shining, earthworms can often be seen on the damp ground. Mencius once used this tiny creature to compare to Chen Zhongzi, a virtuous man of Qi, but he did not approve, believing that he was too concerned with personal purity and had nothing to do with saving the world. Therefore, he said, "If one were to follow the principles of Zhongzi, then one would have to be like an earthworm. For the earthworm, it eats withered matter above and drinks from the Yellow Springs below." This sounds good on the surface. Earthworms only deal with soil and the Yellow Springs and do not contend with other things. However, to consider this as self-preservation is a great mistake. Everyone knows that earthworms "eating withered matter above" can improve the soil and increase fertilizer, which is of great benefit to farmers. The earthworm itself may not be aware of this, but this precisely embodies the virtue of achieving merit without claiming credit, acting silently like the sun and moon, which we cannot help but admire and praise.

It is said that Darwin studied this creature from a young age, spending most of his life on it. In 1881, he published his great work, "The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms," proving that most of the soil on earth has been transformed by earthworms. The original text states: "When we see a large expanse of flat land covered with turf, we should remember that this smooth surface is largely due to earthworms leveling out the unevenness. It is strange to think that the entire surface of this flat land has passed through the bodies of earthworms, and will pass through again every few years. Before humans invented the plow, earthworms had already been plowing the fields! Is there any other small animal in the world that plays such an important role in the history of the earth?"

We really cannot imagine that a dirty little worm could have such great merit. The scientist Thomson calculated that every square mile of land has more than 62,200 tons of soil brought to the surface each year. In 27 years, all the soil to a depth of two feet will be turned over to the surface. Darwin calculated that on average, there are 53,000 earthworms per acre of cultivated land in England, and there may be 500,000 on barren land. These 53,000 earthworms per acre can completely pass ten tons of soil through their digestive systems and move it to the surface in one year. In fifteen years, this soil can accumulate to three inches, and in sixty years, it can accumulate to one foot thick. This is even more astonishing.

Therefore, we also think of all the silent majority, who do their duty and work without praise or reward. What in the world is not made by these people's hands and feet? The pyramids of the Egyptian kings, the Great Wall and canals of China, and even the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station in the Soviet Union. Aren't the hundred-story skyscrapers of the United States and the miles-long Golden Gate Bridge the same? We see that in cruel wars, some people complain, saying things like, "Do not talk about the rewards of nobility; one general's success is built on the bones of ten thousand soldiers." As a result, Paris has a tomb of the unknown soldier, and Washington also erected the same monument. However, I have never heard of anyone holding a memorial service for those who sacrificed themselves for the cause of workers and peasants. War is extraordinary, bestial, and destructive. Frankly speaking, it is the most foolish act of humanity. Yet, some people praise it and commend it. Why is it that those who work hard for the happiness and benefit of all mankind are so neglected? I cannot help but feel pessimistic and doubtful about human reason again.

Confucius is perhaps greater than Mencius. Just looking at words like "A scholar who is devoted to the Way but ashamed of poor clothes and poor food is not worth discussing" shows that he is more broad-minded and practical than Mencius. Also, "Eating coarse rice and vegetables, drinking water, and using one's arm as a pillow – joy is also in it" is even more proactive. Although he would visit Jie Ni, whom Zilu opposed, he did not excessively blame Heaven or Earth when he was hungry in Chen and Cai. Moreover, his replies to the madmen Jie Yu and Chu Kuang also had the meaning of accepting one's fate and sacrificing oneself, that is, "If I am not a follower of these people, then who am I?" It seems that earthworms are destined to eat dung and soil. It is not necessarily as sweet as delicacies, but they swallow grass roots and rotten leaves. Perhaps "knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it" is just like this. Only by knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it, can one ultimately "achieve something." Human progress is not in speculation or shortcuts, but in step-by-step, bit-by-bit accumulation. Even a bloody revolution is just a little bit of acceleration, making it faster. All speculation and luck are like sediment and mineral deposits in a water pipe, which must be cleared. This is precisely the purpose of revolution. Confucius greatly praised Yan Hui's living in a humble alley and drinking from a gourd because although he ate fallen leaves and rotten soil, he truly restrained himself and restored the rites, becoming a model for others, showing his greatness in the ordinary, and not covering up his incompetence with external greatness, such as "mountains carved with birds and beams painted with seaweed."

However, the world teaches by making "great men the idols of young children, ordering them to worship and imitate them," which is truly incomprehensible. Great men are like tigers and leopards among beasts, or falcons among birds, or perhaps even like gorillas and parrots. Suppose all the beasts were tigers and leopards, and there were no dogs to guard the night or cats to catch mice; if all the birds were falcons and there were no murmuring swallows, catching insects, formations of flying geese, or messengers to deliver letters, what kind of world would it be? In chaotic times, there are especially many great men. Cao Cao claimed to be great, and Lü Bu and Yuan Shao were not willing to fall behind. Liu Bei and Sun Quan were even more ferocious. Thus, there was the battle of Puyang, the second battle of Xiapi, and the third battle of Chibi. Eight hundred and thirty thousand soldiers turned into monkeys and cranes, sand and insects. Who bestowed this? As long as someone wants to be a hero, then "order" and "peace" can never be attained. Everyone must be an ordinary worker who eats withered matter above and drinks from the Yellow Springs below, so that we can strive for a little more happiness. Not only that, but in my impression, being a hero and firing a loud cannon is not difficult. As long as one chooses things that ordinary people are unwilling to do or do not want others to do, and does them in a big way, wouldn't that be a hero? The ancients said, "If there were no heroes, then villains would become famous." This saying should be looked at in reverse. The ordinary and honest work and people who "work when the sun rises, rest when the sun sets, dig wells to drink, and till fields to eat" seems easy, but in reality, it is so difficult! Shanghai is crowded with five million people, but the countryside has nothing. Isn't it because everyone wants to come to the city to be a hero and sees farming and digging wells as a long journey? I dare to assert that if the Chinese people and even the people of the world do not have an awakening in their hearts, replacing the special with the ordinary, replacing the great with the universal, replacing the noisy with the silent, like tens of thousands of earthworms, turning out tens of thousands of tons of dung and soil in a year, giving plants a force to grow, so that the masses can all benefit from it, this world will never have peace and true progress.

Please learn from earthworms

### Black

— Nian Chuan

Why do so many people despise black? Is it because it represents a shameless soul? Is it because it symbolizes terrible encounters? But they forget the special quality of black. In a large dyeing vat, so many colors change, but black, it always preserves this color, even though it is unsightly. Let's think again: Crows may be considered unlucky birds because of their black color, but their filial piety is enough to show their greatness. Therefore, when we dislike something or something, don't just look at its surface; we should examine its inner characteristics. Black is an example.

### Morning at South Lake

— Qifeng

While the morning mist was still thick and the dew was still wet, we, filled with youthful joy, quietly stepped into the boat cabin. The boat tilted to one side, and in slight surprise, we couldn't help but smile at each other. We only felt that the boat was gliding through the mirror-like lake surface with the sound of oars, leisurely moving forward.

The reed mat roof had been removed. A clear, refreshing fragrance carried by the morning breeze gently brushed across the lake. In the distance, we could only see a lush green expanse, veiled in a hazy white mist, indistinguishable as fields or houses. A crescent-shaped black shadow floated on the water's surface. As it approached, it turned out to be a bridge, low and narrow. A sturdy farmer stood on the bridgehead, a pipe in his mouth, looking at us in surprise, as if saying, "Such early travelers!"

The sound of the oars resonated rhythmically, monotonous yet a pleasant addition in this serene and beautiful morning. The boatwoman, her eyes still drowsy, perhaps did not sleep well last night, but her face was wreathed in smiles. Her dark face, strong arms, and a clean blue cloth shirt covered her healthy body. No wonder the boatwomen of South Lake have been famous in the Jiangnan region since ancient times! Their natural beauty is truly unique! She seemed to notice our gazes, turned her head slightly, and said shyly in her local accent, "We've arrived at the Misty Rain Tower!"

Before us, we could only see red walls and green trees blurred together in the mist over the water. A few towering, long branches and upturned roof corners vaguely appeared in the vast white mist. We remained silent, filled with a feeling of endless contemplation, allowing ourselves to be immersed in this gentle beauty.

We gently glided past the Misty Rain Tower, pondering in our hearts: Today there is no rain, so let the mist count as rain! Casually looking back again, the red walls and black tiles, pavilions and terraces, were all hidden in the green shade. In this scene, I almost felt like I was in a painting.

A rustling sound came from under the boat, as the short reeds that had been cut grazed the bottom. In the dense aquatic grass on the side of the bank, a flock of ducks leisurely swam by, waddling their plump bodies, stretching their necks, and piercing the silence with their loud calls.

Turning in a circle, the morning mist had unknowingly thinned and dispersed. Raising our heads, we could only see a clear sky and ten thousand miles of light, with a few wisps of floating clouds drifting by. The sunlight shone all over the earth, and we only felt the glittering golden light dazzle our eyes.

Lightly jumping onto the shore steps, we took a few steps, still frequently turning our heads to gaze. This quiet South Lake! It is so tranquil and unadorned, truly making me reluctant to leave.

### The Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 13: Attempting to Remedy (107)

Yunqing lifted her eyelids and glanced at Zhu Qi, saying, "What does it matter if I'm thin or not?" Zhu Qi said, "Your complexion is not good. Are you sick?" Yunqing said, "Sick or dead, it's nothing to do with you!" Zhu Qi stood up, placing both hands on the table, and said, "Yun, how is it nothing to do with me? Not a day goes by that I don't think of you!" Yunqing coldly smiled and said, "Think of me? You haven't shown your face for half a month! Please say these words to someone else!" Zhu Qi said, "Who should I say them to?" Yunqing said, "Think for yourself who you should say them to." Zhu Qi still leered and said, "I'm saying them to you." Yunqing shook her head and said, "I'm not worthy!" Zhu Qi said, "There's no one else! Could it be Fengsheng? I've already divorced her!" Yunqing shook her head. Her tears were already flowing down, drop by drop. She put down the yarn and quickly took out her small handkerchief, dabbing it on the corners of her eyes, and said, "Fengsheng, I'm the one who harmed her. If she hadn't listened to me, she wouldn't have divorced you. I never thought you were this kind of person. Every time I think about it, my heart aches. If you really have a conscience, you should go back and kneel before her, beg her forgiveness, and cancel the divorce papers." Zhu Qi feigned surprise and said, "What are you talking about? I don't understand." Yunqing said, "Don't pretend to be confused. Say something clear. We both know what's in each other's hearts." Zhu Qi said, "The reason I divorced Fengsheng was for you." Yunqing tilted her head back, her face full of anger, and said, "For me?" As she said this, she shook her head and then lowered it again. Zhu Qi, at this point, still did not understand the situation and said, "Don't misunderstand. If it wasn't for you, why would I divorce Fengsheng?" Yunqing shook her head and said "I haven't misunderstood, I understand very well, you shouldn't see others as muddleheaded and yourself as clever, this time you have been clever for your own sake!" Zhu Qi had been so coldly ridiculed that his face could not help but flush red. He sat down again and said, "Yun, I see that your spirit must have been stimulated again, right?" Yunqing said, "I have been stimulated for more than a day, and I am like a mute eating bitter herbs, I have no place to complain, I hope that you will correct your conscience, and do good deeds in the future, and stop deceiving women. Fengsheng is pitiful, you should hurry back, I can understand everything, as for my intention, you know it, I would rather be in debt to others than have others in debt to me, I will not change until I die. Now I am determined to serve my mother, and once my old mother passes away, I will find a charitable organization to serve society, and end my life there. You don't have to come anymore, there is nothing to say even if you come!" Zhu Qi said, "Why is this so?" Yunqing shed tears and said sadly, "What can I say, I can't bear to say even if I can say it. If you must know, you can ask Uncle Xiao Bai."

### The Mystery of the Sword Immortal

— Zhaolong

Having read the article "Two Stories of the Old Capital" in the "Free Talk" section of the 20th of this month, I have not heard of the story of Mr. Chu and dare not comment. As for the story of Wang, the Sword Immortal, I have seen the person and would like to tell it to the readers. Before August 13th, I always resided in Beiping. In the years 1925 and 1926, I heard of Wang, the Sword Immortal, and the legends of running races in the Western Hills. I wanted to meet him very much, but there was no opportunity. Until the years 1932 or 1933 (I don't remember clearly), led by Wang, the Sword Immortal's disciple, I went to meet him. He lived in the last large courtyard of a temple in the western part of Beiping, which was a very quiet place. When we were about to knock on the door, his disciple said, "Don't knock hard, if you knock hard he will get angry, use your finger and gently tap." As expected, after a tap, he came to open the door and welcome us inside. He was about five feet ten inches tall, wearing a blue cloth gown, with a thin face and bright eyes. At first glance, I knew he was a person with a foundation in Chinese martial arts. There was a Buddhist altar in the house, and the table was full of hundreds of sea shells of various sizes. After sitting down, he did not offer tea, but took out a wine glass and poured white liquor to offer to the guests. In conversation, I felt that he did not have much literary cultivation and no profound knowledge. I wanted to spend more time with him, so I talked about this and that for more than an hour. Later, I said I would treat him to dinner, he said okay, so we knocked on the door and went out together. I saw that he looked like he was in his fifties, but he walked with remarkable speed (the word "flew" is just used to express his quickness, not flying like a sword immortal in novels). When we arrived at the restaurant, when offering him the seat, I deliberately used my hand to push his waist to make him sit in the upper place, to test his strength. I felt that his body was very hard and difficult to push, but it was generally possessed by those who were proficient in martial arts, not surprising. After the meal, we parted ways, regretting this visit, it is true that hearing about it is not as good as seeing it, Mr. Wang is just someone deeply proficient in martial arts. As for coming to open the door after tapping his finger, I later carefully observed that there was still a small door in his courtyard, leading to a corridor, directly to the temple door, or someone might have entered the door in advance to report, and then he would wait for a while before coming to open the door, also not knowing. In short, the saying of the Sword Immortal is unbelievable, and Mr. Wang is absolutely not a Sword Immortal. (Paid)

### Poetry Records from Haihonglou

— Xu Banmeng

Dedicated to You Mojun

A heart filled with noble talent is hidden, with generous tragic songs that can also be sorrowful. The literary works of a generation, the pen of Jiang Ling, with winds and rains from all directions, like the Terrace of Yan Zhao. The heart is wounded by the lifelessness of the courtiers, tears fall for the homeland, leaving behind ashes of calamity. Form a poetic realm with a few confidants, throwing out excellent lines, bright as jade.

Spring Wind

The sun and moon throw the shuttle, busy day and night, the spring wind is like scissors cutting out the spring light. Waves shake the mirror-like surface, the writing is gorgeous, the grass greens the waist of the skirt, the embroidery is fragrant. The Narcissus enjoys the hospitality of Tao Qian, the mountain ghost wanders and sings like Qu Yuan, greedily admire the peach and apricot blossoms bustling on the branches, and the bees and butterflies compete to cross the wall.

Inscribing on Shi Guzi's Peach Blossom Spring Painting

Chickens, dogs, mulberry trees, and hemp are all that is needed for immortality. Peach Blossom Spring is not necessarily a fiction. It is only because there are few refined guests in the mundane world that they do not believe that there is a paradise on earth.

A great man, like the governor, is equally busy, but it is difficult to come to a land of peace and happiness after all. Good water and good mountains are everywhere, only a fisherman seeks them out.

When is there ever no struggle in the world? One should avoid Qin and go to this place. It is a pity that fame and profit have entangled people for a long time; who would be willing to spend a lifetime in an empty mountain!

The calamity of war and weapons fills the eyes, and the white bones of the Central Plains fly as ashes again. Where is a good place to settle down in the human world? One should come to the Peach Blossom Spring in the painting.

### Marriage Expert

— Mao Yi

Thomas Finegan is the American man with the most marriages. He often dresses as a groom and holds wedding ceremonies with strange women in the courthouse of Wyandotte County, Kansas. Does Finegan often suffer marital discord? No. Is he a philanderer? That's not right either. Finegan is a lawyer in the county who represents grooms and brides who are overseas in proxy wedding ceremonies.

Not long before Japan surrendered, Finegan's business was booming, with marriages happening almost every two weeks. He thought that once the war ended, this marriage career would calm down. Who knew that the opposite would happen? His proxy weddings became even busier, and he even had to pull his wife in as an assistant.

Mrs. Finegan's role is to be the bride. Some American veterans, because their brides were still overseas and wanting to have a marriage ceremony first, came to consult lawyer Finegan. Because Mr. Finegan is male, it was inconvenient for him to represent the bride, so he brought his wife out. Local people often jokingly ask Mrs. Finegan when they meet her, "How many husbands do you have now?"

Finegan's proxy wedding business began in 1943. That year, a person came to the prosecutor's office in Washington, D.C. He had a niece living in the country who longed to marry someone serving overseas but didn't know how to do it legally. After reviewing the laws of various states, the prosecutor found that only Kansas had a proxy marriage law. So, he wrote a letter to the Wyandotte County Bar Association, whose president at the time was Finegan. He accepted the request to represent the marriage and started this new business.

Now, Finegan has married dozens of brides. Before each wedding, he always calls in his secretary to memorize the name and address of the bride for this particular ceremony. Sometimes, after the proxy wedding ceremony is over, the officiating judge pulls him aside and quietly asks, "Which number is this bride—number forty-five or forty-six?"

Proxy weddings don't always take place in a leisurely manner. There was a country woman who had a relationship with her lover before marriage. Later, the man was transferred abroad, but the woman became pregnant. Both parties wanted to complete the marriage ceremony before the baby was born. Time was very pressing. The woman was in a hospital in Missouri waiting to give birth. She really had no other choice but to seek help from Finegan. He rushed to the hospital to pick her up and accompanied her to Wyandotte County. During the ceremony, Finegan and the heavily pregnant bride were extremely nervous, fearing that the fetus would not be able to hold on and would come out to "attend the ceremony" when the wedding march began to play. Fortunately, this joke did not happen. The bride gave birth the next day after returning safely to the hospital. It was a girl—a girl with "legal" parents.

### Luoyang in Central China

—

Recently viewed the exquisite map of Luoyang on the front page of the Shen Bao on the 17th, which can be regarded as a symbol of the most abundant page of Chinese territory and history. The old saying "the center of the world," the saying "county flowers like brocade," the saying "ancient capital of emperors," there are enough adjectives.

Henan Province is known as "Central China," but Kaifeng, although it is the provincial capital in modern times and the capital of the Five Dynasties and Northern Song Dynasty, cannot represent the word "Central China." Luoyang is the "center of the world," formerly the first county of "Henan Prefecture." Henan Prefecture is the outer prefecture of "Henan Province," so it is said, "Henan is not in Henan Province." During the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Wei held the emperor to command the vassals, occupying the Zhang and Luo areas, claiming to be "China" to oppose Shu and Wu, and also called "Central Plains." Therefore, the "center" character of China was first prosperous in Henan. As for whether Central China is the "center of the world," the "world" in ancient times refers to the territory of the country, and it is more based on the southeast being the sea and the northwest being the mountains as the standard. Roughly measure it, find a place that is close to the sea in the east and far from the desert in the west, which is relatively moderate, and this Central China is close to it.

"Luoyang brocade has myriad flowers," "Since ancient times, the valley has been a land of spirits," the prosperous and beautiful historical sites, and the sad stories of Shi Chong and Green Pearl, are permanently passed down, and there are still relics of "Golden Valley Garden" today. Li Bai wrote in a poem: "I remember Dong Caoqiu in Luoyang in the past, who built a winery for me south of Tianjin Bridge." Luoyang's "Tianjin Bridge" is well-known because of the poet's high praise. So, a good name of Henan was transferred to Tianjin in Hebei, not called "Gu Shang," but called "Jin Qiao." "Gu Shang" is indeed the local scenery of Tianjin (seventy-two Gu), while "Jin Qiao" is borrowed from "Luoyang." Although there are many rivers in Tianjin, there are no famous bridges or ancient sites. As for "Wanguo Bridge" and "Jingang Bridge," although the architecture is extremely magnificent, they are "Western-style Jin Qiao."

The scenic spots of Beiman outside Luoyang City and Yique Longmen are seen in various travel notes. Yu Quyuan was impeached and dismissed from his post as Henan Xuezheng and returned to his hometown, regarding "having visited Yique and Longmen" as not in vain, which shows that it is a famous site. Beiman Mountain has been a burial place since ancient times. Countless celebrities have been sleeping there in the capitals of the past. There was an old man who comforted people in a poem: "Don't sigh about the white hair when you are old, it is also very difficult when the hair turns white. How many young and good sons. A gust of wind blows them up to Beiman Mountain." However, since the Northern Song Dynasty, Central China has not been the capital again, the status of the city has declined, and this "ghost capital" (Beiman) has gradually declined. The Western Hills of Beiping have become the rising Beiman in the north. Duan Qirui, a senior military and political figure from Anhui, died in Shanghai and was also buried in the Western Hills of Beiping. Zhang Shaozeng died in Tianjin and was also buried in the Western Hills. General Zhang Zongchang, a Shandong native, died in Jinan and was also buried in the Western Hills. Celebrities Liang Qichao and Luo Wengan, who were from Guangdong, were also buried in the Western Hills. There are also some Futian Cemetery and Wan'an Cemetery. All the retired officials of Pingjin and various circles in Hebei, once they die, mostly send their bones to the Western Hills. Therefore, the ground in the western suburbs outside Beiping City naturally formed a "modern Beiman."

During Wu Peifu's heyday, Luoyang was virtually the political center. Although it did not have the name of the capital, its momentum was above that of Beijing. At that time, after his successive victories in the wars against the Anhui and Feng armies, he was the Inspector of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan. He chose Luoyang as his residence because it was located at the strategic point of the Longhai Railway and not far from the intersection of the Pinghan Railway. Transportation in all directions was convenient, and it was the capital of emperors of past dynasties. Especially, it was the location of the forest and tomb of Guan Yu, whom he admired most. He thought he was controlling the situation in the center and that the overall situation of China was in his grasp. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, when he was fifty years old, celebrities from the military and political circles and various provinces went to congratulate him. Kang Youwei sent a birthday couplet: "The eagle soars in Muye, only half of the fame and achievements of a hundred generations," "The tiger watches in Luoyang, the winds and rains of all directions will gather in Central China." Zhang Jian, the top scholar from Nantong, sent a birthday couplet: "The prestige of ten thousand miles is like thunder and reaches far"; "The longevity of a hundred years is like the sun in the middle of the sky." This shows the momentum of Luoyang at that time. While Li Yuanhong and Cao Kun were presidents in Beijing, the military and political circles remotely obeyed the command of Luoyang, and Lao Wu's limelight reached its peak. The following year (Jiazi), he failed in the war against Feng, and from then on, he fell into decline. The fiery situation in Luoyang also disappeared, but the importance of its position left an even deeper impression.

In September of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the Japanese invaders launched the "September 18th Incident." In January of the following year, they created a large-scale invasion in Shanghai, threatening Nanjing from Songhu. For the sake of safety and resistance, the government designated Luoyang as the temporary capital, and a part of it had already moved there. At that time, if it were not for the mediation of various countries and the establishment of a peace agreement, then a full-scale resistance would have been forced to begin, and Luoyang would have been the Chongqing of the nearly eight-year war. Isn't its historical value important?
