During the banquet, Wang gave an informal report on his attendance at the United Nations General Assembly, and the legislators expressed their opinions. Wang's attitude was sincere, and his analysis of the overall diplomatic situation was very detailed. The banquet ended at around 9 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] The Weng Cabinet's intention to resign remains firm. However, they still went to the Executive Yuan to work on the 5th, handling various important official matters. The collective resignation of all cabinet members will depend on Weng's actions. The President is still earnestly urging Weng to stay.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu resumed his duties on the 5th, arriving at the ministry around 9 AM to handle official business and leaving at noon. Wang had not been to the ministry since his resignation on the 1st, for four days. His intention to resign remains firm, but he was moved by the President's repeated sincere entreaties and persuasion.

However, according to Wang's aides, he will continue to request his resignation.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] Legislators from the nine northeastern provinces and three municipalities held a full-day meeting during the Legislative Yuan's regular session on the 5th to review the evolution of the situation in the Northeast and the issue of responsibility. They issued a statement based on the opinions expressed during the meeting, stating that the fall of Changchun, Jinzhou, and Shenyang "in reality, it is equal to saying that the United Nations has never won peace, and it has not even won victory. World War II is still continuing to develop." The statement criticized the Soviet Union, saying it "is actually a partner of the Axis countries, and today it is even more the successor of the Axis countries." The statement further detailed the government's failures in diplomacy, domestic affairs, economy, military affairs, and education from the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty to the takeover of the Northeast, the start of the suppression of bandits, and the eventual fall of the entire Northeast. It severely criticized these failures and hoped that the government could learn from its failures and, from the standpoint of the people of the Northeast, formally inform "the free world, politicians and people, especially American politicians and people," that 40 million people "have entered the dark age of the second September 18th." The statement continued, "We, the people, are fighting for national freedom, so we will not hesitate to shed the last drop of blood against all foreign aggressor forces. At the same time, we must also strive for political democracy before we are willing to contribute all our strength. We are saddened by the loss of our homeland, but we are even more saddened and indignant that we cannot exert the strength of our people." Finally, it demanded that "the privileged class must retreat, and the people's strength must advance" to "seek national freedom, political democracy, and finally, the liberation of all people trapped in darkness and terror."

### Premier Weng Speaks on Truman's Re-election as US President; China and the United States Share the Same Desire to Strive for World Peace

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] After hearing the news of President Truman's re-election, Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan issued a statement on the 5th as follows: "The election of President Truman for another term in the United States is a matter of great joy upon hearing in China. President Truman has always attached great importance to world peace. After being elected this time, he reiterated his efforts for the future of world peace, which is completely in line with the wishes of the Chinese people. China hopes to achieve true peace, both domestically and internationally. The resistance to totalitarian countries in the past and the current war against the Communist bandits are being pursued with hardship and without fear of difficulties. The only goal is to overcome the causes of the disturbance and lay the foundation for stability and peace. At this time, the Communist bandits' military force is expanding even further, and its threat to the overall situation of world peace is even greater. President Truman has always been sincere in assisting China. It is hoped that under President Truman's leadership, the United States will understand that the situation in China has a great impact on world peace and will actively assist our country's strength so that the legitimate efforts of our government will achieve success sooner."

### South China Morning Post Editorial: Warning to Reactionaries

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 5th dispatch] The authoritative South China Morning Post here once again warned leftists and all kinds of anti-government elements who have fled to Hong Kong, saying: "The Hong Kong government is friendly to China, so it will not allow those who live here to engage in any actions against the Chinese government, and it is not a good policy for you to adopt the same line as the Communists."

### US Far East Navy Learns Simulated Warfare, Will Hold Exercise for Three Days Starting on the 17th

The Navy will be commanded by Rear Admiral Kinter, and the Air Force will be commanded by Brigadier General Timberlake.

### Truman Wins Election; US Will Continue to Aid China; Both Democrats and Republicans Recognize China as a Pillar of the East; Washington Far East Experts Analyze the Overall Situation

[United Press, Washington, 4th dispatch] Far East experts here mostly believe that the United States will continue to aid China when analyzing Truman's election victory on the 4th. Many experts concluded that even if the Republican Party had won, the final outcome would have been the same. They said that the amount of assistance would depend on future developments in the Far East and Europe. Although there are few proposals to continue or increase aid to China, Truman has guaranteed to oppose any communist government in China. The current situation in the Far East is critical, and Democratic members of Congress have shown no less awareness than Republican members. Even if the Democratic Party lacks the driving force to aid China, there are still Republican stalwarts who are keen to aid China, such as Judd, Fulton, Voorhis, and Bridges, who have returned to Congress this time. In the past, Republican members of Congress often attacked the Democratic Party's Far East policy. Some Democrats believe that they were not really concerned about the Far East and that this was just a political tactic. The withdrawal of the National Army from the Northeast shocked most Americans, who clearly recognized the danger of communism dominating China. Americans are both afraid of the Communist Party sweeping China and concerned about the entire Far East because the Far East policies of both the Democratic and Republican parties recognize China as the mainstay of the East. Judd told the United Press on the 3rd that the fall of the Northeast was the second "Pearl Harbor" and the "most serious crisis" for the security of the United States itself. Other Far East experts believe that when the next Congress convenes, there will be a surge of support for Judd's views, and key figures from both the Republican and Democratic parties in Congress will listen to this call. The mistakes of the United States' Far East policy before World War II are not far away, and memories are still fresh. It is generally believed that Bloom will once again chair the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Based on his past experience, Bloom is expected to be in line with the President and the Secretary of State. Although it is often said that Marshall opposes further aid to China, well-informed sources claim that Marshall's opposition is not to the principle of aid but to the method of handling aid. They said that if Marshall remains in office, he will recognize that the fate of all Far Eastern countries is linked to the fate of China and will advocate strong assistance. They also said that if the United States continues to aid China, it may stipulate that aid will be given according to the precedent of aiding Greece, sending military and economic advisers to assist Chinese officials in promoting their work. Well-informed sources indicated that Truman's election will by no means reduce China's hopes of receiving aid because the Democratic government has shown no signs of tolerating the Communist Party's domination of China and the East. On the contrary, there is reason to believe that the United States' determination to help Far Eastern countries revive and democratize will be expressed by further aid to China. They said the basic factors of the situation have not changed, and Truman's victory has not altered them.

### Yingkou Retreat: Difficult and Magnificent

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] Navy Headquarters News: The National Army of Liaoxi and Pan Yang, which retreated from Yingkou this time, has completed a difficult and magnificent feat of retreating in front of the enemy with the support of our navy ships. The entire course from the entrance of the Liaohe River estuary to the city of Yingkou is about sixteen nautical miles. The riverbed is a winding, narrow, and shallow waterway, with the narrowest point being only a quarter of a nautical mile wide and the shallowest point being only about ten feet deep. Navigation is already difficult on weekdays, and the navigation signs have all been destroyed. The Communist army has also set up various obstacles in the waterway. There were more than three sunken ships at marker number eight alone. After our navy worked day and night, it was successfully opened on the 26th. On the 29th, our navy began to assist the Nationalist army in concentrating, suppressing the Communist army on both sides of the Liao River with fierce firepower. By the 1st of this month, all our main forces had completed their concentration, and they began to board and transport troops at noon that day. By the 4th, all our land forces had safely retreated.

### Admiral Badger Announces in Shanghai: The US Will Not Abandon the Qingdao Base; May Send Marines to Shanghai to Protect Overseas Chinese

[United Press, Shanghai] Admiral Badger, Commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, came to Shanghai from Qingdao for a short visit. He told reporters yesterday: "The US Western Pacific Fleet has no intention of abandoning the Qingdao base as long as it is beneficial to the interests of the United States and the Chinese people. But this does not indicate that it intends or expects to actively participate in the Chinese civil war, nor does it indicate that it is preparing to evacuate American expatriates and other expatriates in China. The Western Pacific Fleet is stationed in China at the request of the Chinese government to support civilian agencies that aid China, support American diplomatic personnel, and protect the lives and property of American citizens. If it is necessary to evacuate expatriates from this country and other countries, the fleet will fulfill its traditional mission based on humanitarian principles and will provide as much assistance as possible to the people of other countries. If requested, it can also evacuate important figures in Chinese politics, just as it evacuates anyone else. As for the fact that Task Force 38 arrived in China at this critical time, it was a coincidence. The current situation is unlikely to cause the task force to remain in Chinese waters for too long. Western Pacific ships are unwilling to transport munitions or supplies to the war zone for the Chinese army to avoid suspicion of participating in the Chinese civil war and must be especially careful not to show favoritism to either side. The safety of the thousands of American expatriates in China depends on the United States maintaining neutrality. If the Navy violates neutrality, it will endanger their safety." When asked if the US Navy would increase its personnel stationed in Shanghai and send marines here, Badger replied: "This is a possibility, but it is purely protective in nature. Its purpose is to protect American expatriates and take into account the people of other friendly countries. The Marines have a special status as international police, so according to international law, they can land on foreign coasts without being considered an act of war." Badger predicted that the results of the US presidential election would not change the Navy's policy in any way. The US Navy will not participate in the Chinese civil war and will only protect expatriates and support the civilian representatives of the US government. As for the evacuation of naval personnel and their families, there is no problem. Any ship stationed in Qingdao can evacuate all of them, so the Navy's position is the safest.

### American Expatriates in Jiangsu and Anhui Regions Ordered to Consider Evacuation

[Our Newspaper] American consulates in Nanjing and Shanghai yesterday simultaneously advised American expatriates residing in Jiangsu and Anhui to consider evacuation while normal means of transport are still available unless there is an urgent need to reside in the area.

The evacuation advisory was issued in Shanghai by the US Consul General in Shanghai to the 3,008 American expatriates registered in the city. In Nanjing, the US Embassy issued the advisory to American expatriates residing in Nanjing and Pukou, estimated to be over a thousand.

The evacuation advisory stated: "Judging from the development of the military situation in North China, the war may continue to spread south, which may interrupt Shanghai's external transportation. At the same time, winter is approaching soon, and the supply of food and fuel is becoming increasingly scarce. Those who remain in Shanghai and its vicinity may encounter various difficulties. Therefore, it is recommended that you consider evacuating while normal means of transport are still available unless you have an urgent need to reside in the area. US Consul General Robert T. Gilbert."

### Tianjin Residents Flock South

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 5th dispatch] There are no signs of a large-scale evacuation of foreign expatriates here, but the Chinese people seem even more unsettled.

The Jin Gang and Yuan Pei, two ships sailing to Shanghai on the 4th and 5th, were chaotic due to the scramble to board the ships.

### Truman Reports: Foreign Aid and Relief Plan

Dissatisfied with Rice Distribution in Nanjing

[United Press, Washington, 4th dispatch] President Truman reported on the 4th that China had not fully fulfilled its agreement to receive US relief supplies between April and June 1948. The government stated in the report prepared by the Administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration that China had clearly not deliberately disregarded the basic principles of the relief agreement, so the failure to fulfill the agreement was due to "the ups and downs of the political, economic, and military situation." The report, the fourth report on relief work, listed the work of the $350 million relief plan for China, Greece, Italy, Austria, and Trieste in the second quarter of 1948. The report pointed out the following errors in the relief program in China: (1) The food ration plan was suspended in Nanjing. (2) Delays in payments in various plans. (3) The inability to set prices at realistic market prices in Shanghai. The report continued: "The Chinese government's records have never been completely accurate and timely," and said that, on the whole, the relief program in China was "successful." The report also said that Chinese officials were "discouraged by low salaries." President Truman warned that US aid must be closely monitored by Americans locally. He emphasized that there were "many difficulties" in providing effective assistance to China. Truman's remarks were considered particularly important in light of the fact that some members of Congress and others are now calling for a sharp increase in aid to China.

### Chairman of Jehol Province Talks About Provincial Affairs

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan passed a temporary motion by Zou Shuwen and others in its regular session on the 5th to send a telegram of condolence to Director Yan Xishan and all the soldiers and civilians in Taiyuan who are holding firm.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan held the 17th meeting of the second session on the 5th, chaired by President Sun.

Chen Mingxian moved to change the order of the agenda and advance the discussion of the reports of the Finance and Budget Committees on improving the treatment of civil servants. The committee members spoke enthusiastically, all advocating that the adjustment of the treatment of civil servants and teachers should be based on the ability to maintain the lives of their families so that they can work with peace of mind. The distribution system must be handled properly so that they can obtain real benefits. Pan Lianfang and others also proposed amendments to the two proposals A and B (the main points were recorded in this newspaper on October 31) proposed in the review report, advocating that the gold yuan coupons should be issued in full according to the salary amount.

No conclusion was reached at 6 PM, and it was announced that the meeting would be adjourned after it was decided to continue the meeting on the 6th.

### And the Defensive War Enters a New Stage: Bandit's Fourth Offensive Thwarted · 300,000 Residents Unanimously Mobilized · Yanggao in Northern Shanxi, Chicheng in Eastern Chahar, and Xianghe in Eastern Hebei All Reportedly Recovered

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, This Newspaper, 5th] The air force from the Xi'an base was dispatched day and night yesterday and today to bomb and destroy multiple artillery positions of the bandit army on the mountain east of Dalao Mountain and Guadi Gully, killing hundreds of bandits and destroying more than forty bandit wagons in Dongjiazhuang, Shangzhuang, and the east bank of the Fen River in the southern suburbs.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th] The defense of Taiyuan has a tendency to move to a new stage. The fourth offensive launched by the invading bandits on October 31 was met with a heroic joint counterattack by our infantry, air force, and artillery in the battles of Shantou, Numazi, Niutuo Village, etc., and after being crushed, the bandit offensive was again thwarted. From the evening of the 4th to the morning of the 5th, the war in the suburbs has shown a state of tranquility. Only the remnants of the 39th Brigade of bandits in the area east of Numazi, ten miles east of the city, attempted to invade on the evening of the 4th, but were immediately subjected to a flanking attack by powerful national troops. The bandits were attacked from both sides and fled in panic. At night, a gang of bandits attacked our positions near Beiwu City and Xutan, more than 30 miles north of the city, but were repelled by the defending soldiers. Near Numazi and southeast of Songzhuang, there were also gangs of bandits attempting to cause trouble this morning, but they did not succeed.

Editorial

### Two or Three Things After the Economic Reform

Economic conditions are the most complex. Once a national policy is changed, when it shifts from its original state to the new level after the change, there will inevitably be a period of disturbance and chaos for a considerable period. This is a fact that cannot be avoided. To shorten this transition period and reduce the degree of chaos, it is essential to take prompt and decisive action and quickly adopt some necessary and reasonable measures to be effective.

As far as the supplementary plan for this financial and economic reform is concerned, such as the immediate cancellation of the exit restriction measures, the quick decision on pricing based on cost for some items, and the preparation for wage adjustments, these efforts are all appropriate and timely measures. However, the phenomenon of market turmoil has not improved so far. In particular, market prices are shouted wildly without any guidelines, and general solo operators, scalpers, and special figures are taking the opportunity to snap up goods, which has increased market chaos and the public's panic. The relevant authorities cannot but bear considerable responsibility for this.

Because the supplementary measures clearly stipulate that items such as yarn, oil, flour, coal, and salt should all be priced by the central government based on cost, and these items are undoubtedly most closely related to people's daily needs. If the prices of these items are quickly determined and universally enforced, not only can clear guidance be obtained for future living standards and management policies, but also there will be standards for other general price negotiations and free markets to refer to. It is a pity that the central government is too busy with personnel matters at this critical moment and has not paid attention to this. According to local authorities, even the routine documents of this supplementary plan have not yet been forwarded. No wonder there is so much turmoil everywhere, without a practical solution.

The relevant ministries and departments may think that other important items, namely daily necessities and industrial raw materials, have been authorized to be managed by local authorities, and that the central government should not be solely responsible. However, various prices are mutually related. For example, if the price of cotton cloth is not determined, local authorities will have no way to start with the price of cotton, its main raw material. Also, the price of coal briquettes should of course be based on the price of coal. Now that the price of coal has not yet been determined by the central government, how can local authorities deliberate? We are not saying these words to shirk responsibility for local governments. There are now many counties and cities that have not even earnestly abolished the previous ban on obstructing the outflow of goods in accordance with the central government's intentions, and even inspections and searches have intensified. There is even less talk of pricing or price negotiations. This is really too outrageous! But why are government orders so slow? And why does the higher-level agency allow it to happen naturally without supervision? The higher-level authorities cannot say that they have no responsibility at all.

In addition to prices, the most crucial issue is the adjustment of wages and salaries for civil servants and teachers. The salaries of civil servants and teachers have already been decided by the three-day administrative meeting to increase by one and a half times according to the October standard. The resolution of this issue can be considered quite fast, but it completely ignores the current facts. Because current prices are at least four or five times higher than before, even seven or eight times higher. Take the postal service operated by the government itself as an example. Once adjusted, it jumped up twenty times. Why is the salary of civil servants and teachers only allowed to increase by one and a half times? In addition, the total amount of currency issued at the end of October has reached about 1.6 billion yuan. Except for about 600 million yuan issued to redeem gold notes, it has actually increased fivefold. In this situation, it is not difficult to imagine the future trend of prices. Why are rigid regulations still being made, refusing to restore the index calculation method? Therefore, the government may think that this problem has been solved, but in fact it cannot be solved.

As for how to adjust winter wages, this issue is even more serious. Because according to the central government's intention, the cost of living index can only be used as a reference, but not as a standard. Moreover, this reference material must still be kept secret and not allowed to be published. We also know that the cost of living index is not the only standard for calculating wages. In the past, when salaries were calculated based on the index, there were indeed many criticisms. However, in the absence of other more reasonable standards, this statistic is at least a scale that all parties can trust and abide by. Since the central government allows the index to be used as a reference, it can be seen that they have not denied that it has reasonable value. Why is it not allowed to be used as a calculation standard? And why is it not allowed to be published on a regular basis? Do they think that the wage issue is as simple as the salaries of civil servants and teachers, and can be resolved with an order? Now, the city's Chamber of Commerce, Industrial Association, and General Labor Union have jointly telegraphed requesting the official restoration of the index as the standard for adjusting wages. We hope that the central government will quickly consider appropriate measures to eliminate the many labor disputes that are just beginning.

Following the supplementary nine-point plan, there are many urgent issues to be resolved, such as how to handle foreign exchange, how to maintain rationing, how to change bank interest rates, how to open up loans for production enterprises, and how to conduct import and export trade. These are all things that the central authorities cannot delay. At the local level, there are naturally many tasks that need to be sorted out, such as how to clear and return sealed goods? Should the method of purchasing and borrowing with vouchers continue to exist in the future? In addition to concealing gold notes and not reporting them, should the method of randomly reporting accusations be used to harass industrial and commercial operators? There are still some commodities priced based on cost that have not been formally decided. How should the procedures be completed as soon as possible? These are all urgent issues to be resolved now. Among them, the most concerned by the public and the most difficult to handle is how to implement price negotiations. That is, after pricing based on cost, how to make these prices effectively take effect and no longer have a black market. This is where the success or failure of the new plan lies, and it is also the most important task for all localities. After suffering from the pain of rigid price limits, everyone naturally does not want to repeat the old story and return to the strictly controlled situation of the past. However, negotiating without limiting is the same as not negotiating, and limiting after negotiating first clearly takes into account production costs and the interests of merchants, and does not force any party to suffer unreasonable losses. Therefore, general merchants should automatically restrain each other and earnestly abide by the price negotiations, and not engage in the pursuit of excessive profits, harming themselves and others!

### Yan Jiagan Flies to Taipei to Discuss New Financial and Economic Measures and the Use of US Aid

[Special Dispatch from Taipei, This Newspaper, 5th] After being repeatedly summoned by Wei Daoming, Yan Jiagan flew to Taiwan on the morning of the 5th. After getting off the plane, he immediately met with Chairman Wei for a long talk to discuss the new financial and economic measures to be taken in the province in the future. At 3:00 p.m., Yan met with reporters and said that his mission here was to discuss the financial and economic measures that Taiwan Province should take in the future and to negotiate the use of the US aid receiving agency in Taiwan Province. Regarding financial and economic matters, Yan said that the economic development of the mainland has obviously had a significant impact on Taiwan Province, and that Taiwan's own economic situation should be able to avoid this phenomenon. The key is the current value of the Taiwan dollar. The central government has adjusted the Taiwan exchange rate and decided on the principle of reasonable adjustments in the future, which has provided important guarantees for stabilizing the Taiwan economy. How to make it more stable still needs to be studied and discussed. Regarding the US aid issue, Yan first made a comprehensive report, saying that the economic assistance part totaled 275 million US dollars (of which nine-tenths were grants and one-tenth was loans), including 20,380,000 US dollars in grants for grain, cotton, petroleum and its products, and fertilizers. Except for grain, Taiwan can obtain quotas for cotton, petroleum, etc. The quota for cotton will be distributed based on the number of spindles in operation. A large amount of crude oil will be supplied to the Kaohsiung Petroleum Plant for petroleum. Taiwan will receive a considerable amount of fertilizers, but the method of distribution has not yet been determined. There are also 70 million US dollars for the construction part, half of which is to supplement funds, 25 million US dollars is for special construction funds, and the remaining 10 million US dollars is for the Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee. Taiwan has received the following US aid for the construction part: (1) 2.5 million US dollars for power equipment, (2) 3.5 million US dollars for special construction funds, 1.5 million US dollars for railways, (3) 5 million US dollars for fertilizers, (4) 1 million US dollars for sugar, (5) 250,000 US dollars for the groundwater development plan. Regarding the development of groundwater, Yan said that Hawaii has been very successful. After investigation by American experts, Taiwan also believes that there are water sources that can be used for water supply and agricultural irrigation. If development is successful, it will become a new resource for Taiwan. A small amount of aid will also be obtained for coal mines. Yan finally said that the US aid materials are not limited to purchases in the United States. The only condition is the lowest price. The purpose is to enable US aid to have economic exchanges with other countries and benefit each other. These imported products replace regular imports, so they have the effect of balancing international payments and contracting currency internally. As for the aid for the construction part, people generally misunderstand that it must be completely controlled by the US. In fact, according to bilateral agreements, the United States is only responsible for the overall design for the replacement of equipment or the new establishment of projects. All project commissions are based on the conditions of the lowest price, the fastest time, and the highest quality. Yan is scheduled to return to Shanghai in three days to take care of the affairs of the US Aid Council and will come to Taiwan again, and will stay for a longer period of time.

### The United States Decides to Maintain a Strong Force to Prevent Communist Threat to Western Europe; UN Political Committee Debates the Greek Situation; The US Hopes that Greece's Neighbors Will Correct the Current Situation

[United Press, Paris, 5th] The US representative, Dulles, declared at the end of the debate on the Greek issue in the UN Political Committee on the 5th, "The United States is currently arming because the Soviet Union and communism threaten the sovereignty of various countries, and the world fears both. Our strength is not only for our own use." Dulles also said that the Soviet representative Vyshinsky's constant criticism of the US foreign policy initiatives was "malicious slander." He said, "Vyshinsky accuses us of developing Greece into a so-called US-dominated base for global aggression. By this, he wants to divert the world's attention from Greece. We firmly deny such malicious slander." He said that the reason why the United States suspended disarmament was that the world feared the Soviet Union, and the United States "is determined to maintain a strong force" until communism no longer threatens the sovereignty of various countries. Dulles said that US diplomacy is clear and upright, with nothing to be ashamed of. "What we have done is not the behavior of those who aim to dominate the world. The United States has suspended its disarmament plan today, and this is true. However, the defeat of Germany and Japan has not eradicated the fear in people's hearts. This is a new fear that cannot be eliminated by international organizations. The partial reason is that the Security Council has become paralyzed." He said that some countries do not even dare to express their fear. Dulles reviewed the Greek Communist attack strategy and said that Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia are undoubtedly assisting the Greek Communists. He pointed out that after the war, the United States "completely withdrew and did not organize any fifth column." He said that the motivation for the US military buildup program is for self-preservation, but also for the security of the whole." Dulles said that the United States is willing to accept Australia's suggestion to request the UN to convene a meeting immediately to hear the opinions of representatives from Southern Albania, Bulgaria, and Greece to find a way to resolve the dispute.

### Atomic Energy Control Plan; UN General Assembly Passes Suggestions from Western Countries; Six Countries to Consult and Seek a Basis for Agreement

[United Press, Paris, 4th] The United Nations General Assembly today passed the international atomic control plan proposed by the United States with a vote of forty to six, by a show of hands. The Soviet bloc voted against it, and India, South Africa, Afghanistan, and Venezuela abstained. This is the first major resolution of this General Assembly. The Soviet counterproposal and the Indian compromise proposal were both rejected beforehand.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky criticized the US plan, saying that since there is no possibility of agreement between East and West, there is no room for discussion on atomic control. The US plan is false and untrue and will only subject the economic life of other countries to the trampling of its controlling agencies. Philippine representative Romulo regretted that the Soviet Union could not implement the spirit of compromise it showed at the beginning of the conference. The contents of the atomic control plan passed by the General Assembly are as follows: (1) Approve the atomic control plan agreed to by the majority as the basis for establishing effective international control. The plan was drafted two years ago by the US representative to the Atomic Energy Commission, Baruch. (2) Formally express concern about the stalemate between the Soviet Union and Western countries on the atomic issue. (The Soviet Union opposes the monitoring provisions in the Baruch Plan). (3) Request the six countries of China, the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Canada to jointly study whether there is a basis for agreement and submit a report before the next General Assembly. (4) Order the Atomic Energy Commission to continue the work that was suspended this spring.

The total number of people in the aforementioned institutions is 5,181, and according to the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the number of people to be relieved can reach 29,398. The Committee deeply hopes that all sectors of society will help together to promote this international relief program.

[Our Newspaper] Gui Sheng, the captain of the Criminal Police Team in Shanghai County, along with team member Li Longfu, inspected vehicles on Minhang Road on August 11th of last year. As a result, they found a package of heroin weighing 12 ounces on four passengers: Wang Li Shi, Xu Xiu Fang, Li Xi Ying, and Chen Xiao Ren. Except for Chen Xiao Ren, who was released on bail, the rest were detained. Ding then swallowed ten ounces of the heroin and falsely told the detainees, "It is being sent to the forensic doctor for examination. When you are sent to court in the future, you should only say it was two ounces; saying more will get you into trouble with the officials." The case was discovered in Shanghai County, and the three suspects were sent to the Shanghai Government's Judicial Office for questioning. After interrogation, it was learned that Ding had embezzled ten ounces of heroin. County Magistrate Yu Yueqiu of the county then detained Ding and Li. Subsequently, Li died due to illness. The county had not yet concluded the investigation when someone secretly reported to the Third District Public Office of Jiangsu and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, claiming that County Magistrate Yu Yueqiu, County Police Chief Yang Huanzhang, and Security Captain Xu Shaoyun colluded with Li and others to embezzle and commit fraud. Upon receiving the report, the Provincial Government transferred the case to the Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office, but due to a jurisdictional error, it was transferred to the Wuxian District Prosecutor's Office. After submission through the Supreme Court, it was designated to be investigated by the Shanghai Municipal District Prosecutor's Office.

### Celluloid Industry Association Makes Five Demands

Therefore, we feel particularly difficult about building houses and relocating. However, government orders should be strictly followed. For the sake of both sides, we propose that the authorities approve the following: (1) If the report about the upcoming order to suspend operations is true, it should not be implemented to avoid the worry of starvation among the members of this association. (2) We hope the Land Administration Bureau will assist in leasing land. (3) We ask for the approval of loans to facilitate land leasing and house construction. (4) We hope the Public Utilities Bureau will assist in installing water, electricity, and public telephones. (5) We hope the Police Bureau will install fire-fighting equipment and security guards. If the above five items are approved by the authorities, the member factories of this association will start relocation.

### Suppression Work in Southern Anhui

— Our Reporter Huang Xingtian

[Our Newspaper, Tunxi, 2nd] The hilly area of 23 counties in southern Anhui is suitable for the growth and development of bandits, especially those areas bordering Anhui, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Anhui, Jiangsu, where the terrain is complex and administratively a no-man's land. In the past, southern Anhui was particularly prosperous in culture and produced many talented people, which led to a civil character that valued literature over military affairs. The residents all had a gentle character. Due to these natural environments and favorable conditions, southern Anhui has always been a place where banditry is particularly prevalent. This reporter visited southern Anhui this time and will briefly report what I know.

This is the Third Generation

The current bandits in Anhui are already the third generation. Initially, during the suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Fang Zhimin led 70,000 to 80,000 troops into southern Anhui to establish a base. The second time was when Ye Ting's "New Fourth Army" returned to southern Anhui, established a base, and grew to 50,000 to 60,000 people. Now, this third generation of bandits are old subordinates of the "New Fourth Army" who have learned from the lessons of the second time and have gradually grown. The current title is "Southern Anhui Detachment of the People's Liberation Army of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi." The combat-ready troops are approximately 4,000 people. However, according to official reports, its strength is approximately 11,500 people, with one heavy machine gun, more than 30 light machine guns, more than 60 short guns, and more than 1,700 rifles. Its commander is Xiong Zhaoren, deputy commanders are Liu Kui and Lin Hao, political commissar is Hu Ming, and chief of staff is Yang Ming.

A small number of remnants left behind by the "New Fourth Army" lurked among the people and secretly carried out activities, which were not noticed by the local government and local gentry. In the spring of the 36th year of the Republic of China, they began to stir, recruiting bandits and coercing hooligans, and then seizing rural security forces to establish mountain bases. Later, they organized militias and used resistance to conscription, resistance to grain, and resistance to rent as slogans. As a result, many blindly followed, and the bandit forces became rampant. All counties in southern Anhui were devastated, especially Taiping, Shitai, Jingde, Jixi, Yixian, and Shexian counties. All four borders were lost, and they closed their city gates to defend themselves. Government orders could not be enforced outside the city, and the situation was very serious.

Southern Anhui Headquarters

In June of last year, the Anhui Provincial Authorities established the Southern Anhui Supervision Group to supervise and reorganize the administration and grass-roots organizations of the counties in southern Anhui. Subsequently, due to the weak self-defense forces in southern Anhui and the further aggravation of the bandit situation, the Southern Anhui Headquarters was established in October of last year to be responsible for commanding the entire Southern Anhui Security Regiment and Security Police Force, becoming a sequential organization for the suppression of bandits in southern Anhui.

After the Southern Anhui Headquarters was first established in Wuhu, it formed an advance command post and led Cheng Ying of the Fourth Anhui Security Regiment southward, capturing Jingxian and Maolin in one fell swoop. It swept along the way and went straight to Huizhou. It successively destroyed important military bases of the bandits, such as Qiaoshanling in Jing County, Shangjinshan in Jixi County, Jiuhuashan in Qingyang County, Banqiao in Ningguo County, Wuxishan and Longmensi in Taiping County, Yangjiadun in Yixian County, and Hengshandian in Shexian County. It ordered the county party headquarters to organize anti-rebellion work teams to go deep into the bandit areas with the army to carry out reconstruction work, and successively recovered more than 220 towns and villages. At the same time, political workers from various counties expanded propaganda and instigated bandits and militias to turn against the government and surrender, successively disintegrating more than 160,000 militias.

Self-Defense Regular Army

In this way, after developing from point-line recovery to area control in military affairs, and strengthening the people's sense of belonging in politics, it focused on strengthening the self-defense regular army in various counties. The counties in southern Anhui have gradually been replenished over the past year, and 67 companies have been added successively, and more than 230 machine guns and more than 1,900 rifles have been purchased. At the same time, seven county joint defense district offices and 76 township joint defense district offices were established, and more than 2,300 large and small watchtowers were built. Civilian forces were mobilized to repair provincial and county highways, and troops were dispatched to sweep and defend them, so as to develop transportation and protect the safety of travelers.

Two Major Conspiracies

Over the past year, the bandit forces in southern Anhui have been greatly damaged. Currently, the bandits have two goals: one is to roam in the mountains, seize rural security forces, run around, rob grain everywhere, and extort money and goods to disrupt social order and damage the rear. The other is to expand the confusion of ignorant people and youth, gradually expand the bandit forces, and actively try to flee back to the old lair in Jiangxi. In response to these two conspiracies, the Southern Anhui Headquarters has appealed to the government to add two regiments of the National Army to use the National Army as the main force, cooperate with the provincial army, and mobilize the regular self-defense forces of various counties. Under unified command, the party, government, army, and people are mobilized to cooperate and launch a major suppression in order to thoroughly eliminate them. General Tang Enbo, Director of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters, recently went to southern Anhui to inspect and decided to strengthen mobility to deal with the bandits' roaming and to improve the rural security organization to deal with "breaking into parts." In this way, the suppression work in southern Anhui will be smoother in the future.

### "Tobacco Famine" in Great Britain

— Special Correspondent in London for This Newspaper: Ben Geng

[Airmail from this newspaper, London, October 28th] British-made cigarettes are quite famous, but recently a "tobacco famine" has occurred in Great Britain. In normal times, cigarettes in Great Britain do not seem to be a readily available consumable. The usual approach is, if you absolutely must have cigarettes, or even a specific quantity of a certain brand, it's best to identify a tobacco shop and regularly buy a fixed amount. This way, after establishing yourself as a "regular customer," you'll have many advantages. Otherwise, you might not get the quantity you need, or you might not get the brand you particularly like. But in any case, the problem of a "famine" had not yet occurred. Not long ago, the government announced that the supply of tobacco would be reduced by four percent, and then the tobacco famine occurred. The tobacco industry union approached the Board of Trade to discuss the situation. It is said that the issue was also raised in a recent cabinet meeting.

The main tobacco-producing region within the British Empire is Rhodesia in South Africa. However, because Rhodesia can exchange tobacco for gold dollars, it currently only sells two-thirds of its production to Great Britain each year.

Great Britain currently needs 205 million pounds (weight) of tobacco each year. This year, it has already purchased 135 million pounds from the United States and 60 million pounds from other countries. The total falls short by about 10 million pounds. Therefore, there are only three solutions: reduce the supply, increase purchases, or use stockpiles. It is said that even after reducing the tobacco supply by four percent, it is still more than before the war. Before the war, tobacco shops received only 1.45 billion cigarettes per week. Recently, it has reached 1.6 billion cigarettes.

The current tobacco famine involves approximately two factors: 1. The increase in the number of smokers in recent years, especially women smokers; 2. Some people, hearing that the tobacco supply would be reduced by four percent, are hoarding cigarettes. Perhaps some people think, why not use the method of increasing taxes and prices to reduce the number of smokers? But today's tobacco taxes and prices in Great Britain are already very high. Last spring, a pack of twenty cigarettes increased from two shillings and four pence to three shillings and four pence (price), and now it is three shillings and six pence. Excessive increases could lead to demands for wage increases. Not long ago, the Board of Trade's tobacco advisor made a speech, advising everyone to smoke one less cigarette out of every ten, and not to hoard cigarettes.

### Rice Market Transactions Still Suspended; Flour and Grains Continue to Rise

Yesterday, rice transactions were still suspended, with scarce arrivals and no goods on the market. Rice shops had no rice for sale. Because some producing areas, such as Pinghu, are still preventing rice from leaving the area, arrivals are difficult to improve. 785 piculs and 5 dou arrived at the South Market, but were not opened for sale, and were mostly sold at the door. The North Market quoted 105 yuan for medium white japonica rice, with only 203 piculs arriving. It is reported that the price of white japonica rice in the suburbs is 150 yuan.

Flour transactions have not yet officially opened. The six major flour mills, including Fu Ti and Fu Xin, opened grades 234 and 2 flour in the afternoon. Grade 2 flour was priced at 41 yuan, and miscellaneous brand grade 2 flour was quoted as high as 53 yuan, another increase of 8 yuan. Wheat bran rose another 2 yuan to 45 yuan.

Miscellaneous grains are rapidly climbing to a peak, rising unanimously due to shortages. Soybeans rose 15 yuan, and corn and red sorghum each soared by as much as 17 or 18 yuan. Mung beans and red beans have risen sharply, sesame seeds have risen another 10%, and shelled peanuts have risen 20 yuan.

Edible oil is similarly stagnant, with no goods on the market. Manufacturers are not opening due to low raw materials and high costs, and traders cannot transport them due to high prices in the producing areas, so there are no sellers.

Soybean cake soared by 14 yuan, and large bean cake was priced at 47 yuan.

### 26th Period of Taiwan Sugar for Sale; Allotment Price 135 Yuan

[Report from this newspaper] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation yesterday afternoon put up for sale over 12,000 bags of No. 24 raw sugar from the 26th period, with an allotment price of 135 yuan, allotted to 308 companies. The maximum amount applied for by sugar merchants was 100 bags per company, with 20% of that amount set aside for public servants and teachers. For re-refined sugar merchants and direct users, the maximum amount applied for was 20 bags per company, and the sugar obtained through redistribution did not need to be set aside again.

Yesterday, sugar was not traded in the market. Initial spot prices were quite inflated. In the middle of trading, the market’s cash flow became tight. Interest rates crept back up. Speculators caught up in capital flow problems showed a willingness to offload inventory. Overall, there were not many transactions at the spot market. Quoted prices varied greatly. The market looked chaotic.

### Tea Market Transactions Stalled

[Report from this newspaper] According to tea industry authorities: Since the authorities permitted negotiated pricing, various industries have gradually returned to normal, but tea market transactions remain stalled. The reason is that re-refining manufacturers are aware that tea stocks in the producing areas are scarce, prices are rising rapidly, labor and all ancillary raw materials have increased sharply, and rumors of changes in foreign exchange have become widespread, further strengthening the reluctance to sell, with prices rising without limit. It is reported that this year's special Keemun tea costs as much as 1,000 yuan per dan, and Wutun large batches are quoted at 700 yuan, and although exporters intend to purchase them, the current prices are extremely high, and it is difficult to open up various patterns.

### Spot Cotton Market Stagnant; Quoted Prices Chaotic

[Report from this newspaper] There were no transactions in the spot cotton market yesterday. Most speculators are watching and not selling. Sources from producing areas are extremely scarce, and prices are rising day and night, so the market is stagnant, and the quoted prices for Zhoupu seed cotton are also very chaotic.

[Another report] After the announcement of the supplementary economic control plan, the National Cotton United Purchasing Company will also stop purchasing cotton. Cotton merchants in the city have recently been remitting funds to the producing areas to start cotton purchasing work. It is reported that the cotton supply in various producing areas such as Hankou and Nantong is not strong, and the inventory is not large. The reason is that during the price restriction period, cotton farmers and cotton merchants were afraid of being searched by the authorities and selling at the restricted price. Under the atmosphere of panic, the raw cotton was secretly moved away and stockpiled in remote villages far away. It has been many days since the price restriction was lifted, but there are still not many supplies on the market. The business of various cotton purchasing firms is extremely quiet, and the prospects for this year's harvest are expected to be pessimistic.

### Cotton Yarn Quoted Prices Chaotic; China Textile Allotments Adopt Finished Product Exchange Method

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was still not open. Outside the market, transactions were booming due to the loosening of credit. Prices were increasingly chaotic due to the rising cost of raw cotton, and prices hit new peaks. 42-count fine yarn Blue Phoenix soared to 9,500 yuan, with buyers willing to purchase. 32-count Silver Moon was at 6,500 yuan, 21-count Double Horse was at 5,700 yuan, 20-count coarse yarn Golden City was at 5,500 yuan, and 16-count Guangming was at 4,500 yuan. The market was very active.

Another report: The China Textile Company's supply of cotton yarn did not post prices yesterday. It is reported that the allotment method adopted a barter system. Yesterday, dyeing and weaving industries (A, B, C, D) were limited to four groups. Each piece of 20-count yarn (exchanged today for 20-count Tianguan big bag) was exchanged for 12 pounds of fine cloth (56×58) 31 bolts. Other industries will start processing next Monday.

Yesterday, cotton cloth quoted prices soared, and people were optimistic. Although customers seemed hesitant, it was heard that capital from North China was pouring in, and brokers were competing to purchase. Moreover, the Textile Construction Company's supply of cloth to dyeing factories and retail stores was limited to only ten bolts per household, and it was rumored that the company needed to exchange for finished products in order to supply military and civilian needs and purchase raw materials. From yesterday (5th), the yarn and cloth sold by the company and the Central Bank must be exchanged for finished products, and detailed measures will be formulated separately. At the same time, there were rumors of layoffs, so the market was particularly active. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was quoted at 210 yuan to 240 yuan with buyers willing to pay. Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji hovered between 230 yuan and 260 yuan. 190 high-grade shilin cloth was quoted at 400 yuan. Therefore, cloth shops in the city still cannot resume business.

### Tight Money Market; Capital from North China Flows South

Yesterday, the money market remained tight, but the trend was slightly looser than on Thursday. Overnight interest rates fell from a high of 25 yuan to 22 yuan, and the average was around 20 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 6.4%. The number of remittances from northern capital has increased sharply. Passenger ships arriving at the port all carry funds to Shanghai. In South China, Guangzhou, commodity prices have recently fallen back. Those with funds generally consider Shanghai as their destination. Cash transport and single-item trading are exceptionally active. Yesterday, the interest rates for cargo escorts soared again. The price for beautiful bedding was 4,000 yuan. The overnight interest rate for same-day payments was 4,200 yuan. A monthly interest rate of 1.5 yuan for every 100 yuan was charged, but there were still many people scrambling to pay.

### Amount of Old Legal Tender Recalled Reaches 300 Trillion

It has been two and a half months since the currency reform. The exchange of old legal tender will be declared closed on the 20th of this month. According to Deputy Director Chen of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, 300 trillion legal tender has been recalled in these two and a half months. This figure is equivalent to half of the total amount of old legal tender issued. It is estimated that at least 200 trillion can still be recovered, excluding damaged and discarded currency. Whether the exchange period for legal tender will be extended is not currently being considered.

### State-Owned Enterprise Shares Sold for Over 6 Million

[Report from this newspaper] As of the end of last month, the Central Bank and its entrusted banks in various locations have sold state-owned enterprise shares totaling 6,682,500 gold yuan. Textile Construction shares accounted for 3,460,500 yuan, Taiwan Sugar shares for 2,787,300 yuan, Taiwan Paper Industry for 377,200 yuan, China Merchants Bureau for 53,500 yuan, and Tianjin Paper for 4,000 yuan.

### Silk Rises Uniformly

Yesterday, the quoted prices for artificial silk continued to rise sharply. Prices for various goods outside the industry have been rising steadily recently. There is much speculation in the industry about whether the Central Trust Bureau will continue to supply silk next week, so sentiment is uniformly bullish. 120-count Tianqiao was quoted at 9,500 yuan, and Dongyang approached 10,000 yuan. However, there were no accurate reports for over-the-counter transactions between brokers. The market remains chaotic.

After the lifting of price controls on raw silk, supplies have not yet increased significantly. Due to the surge in artificial silk prices, sentiment in the industry has followed suit. Moreover, with the opening of foreign trade, the silk weaving industry is eager to replenish supplies. People are buying as soon as they see silk for sale, regardless of price. The trend is still that demand exceeds supply. D-grade 78 yuan has increased from over 9,000 yuan to 11,200 yuan. Premium small lots are quoted at 11,000 yuan. There is no news of other transactions.

Due to the rising cost of raw materials, silk satin has followed suit. Factories are selling very little, and buyers are trying hard to purchase. Retail stores on the street have sold a lot during the price restriction period and have been continuing to replenish stocks in recent days, so the market continues to be active. Huaqiang bedding has risen to 5,500 yuan, and other goods such as Dawei呢 have also risen uniformly.

### China Farmers Bank Begins to Handle Emergency Loans for Winter Cultivation

In order to increase production and regulate food supply, the Farmers Bank of China has launched emergency loans for winter cultivation.

[Report from Dazhong News Agency] Yesterday morning, students at Guanghua University in the city, in view of the alarming rise in prices after the government lifted price controls and faced with the unbearable burden of tuition, fees, and living expenses, demanded that the school be nationalized, but did not receive a satisfactory response.

### ### Title Copying

— Yi Jun

When schools hold exams, students always ask when they receive the paper: "Should we copy the title?" The answer is uncertain. Some teachers say to copy, others say not to. Encountering a teacher who says it's unnecessary, one can certainly not copy the title, but copying it doesn't hurt either. However, encountering a teacher who says to copy, not copying it becomes a bit of a problem. Therefore, an experienced student who has been through many exams knows that whether they ask or not, it's always safer to copy the title.

A scholar once said: "Life is a constant examination." I think this is very true. For example, talking to someone is an examination of language, knowledge, and understanding; buying things is an examination of discernment, choice, and calculation; eating is testing whether your tongue can taste, your teeth can chew, your throat can swallow, and your stomach can digest, and so on; walking is testing whether your feet can lift, your eyes can recognize traffic lights, and your brain can distinguish directions; a worker is tested on whether they can create certain kinds of objects; a farmer is tested on what products they can harvest; a merchant is tested on how much profit they can gain; an official, if good, is tested on how much benefit they can bring to the public, if bad, is tested on how skillful their corruption is.

Life is a constant examination, truly.

Then, does the examination of life need a title?

In Aesop's Fables, there is a story of a wolf eating a lamb. The gist of the story is:

One day, a lamb went to a stream to drink water and happened to meet a wolf, who was eager to eat the lamb but had no reason. So he said sternly, "How dare you! You dare to muddy the clear water in my stream! How am I supposed to drink it?"

The lamb was shocked and hurriedly protested, "You are standing upstream, and I am standing downstream. Even if I dirtied the water, it wouldn't flow back to you!"

The wolf then changed his tune, "Even if that's the case, you're still a bad egg. I heard you were secretly scolding me last year..."

At this time, the lamb cried out, "Mr. Wolf, that's a real injustice! I wasn't even born last year!"

The wolf had another reason. He bared his sharp teeth, roaring, "Hmph, you rascal, if it wasn't you who scolded me, then it was your father! In any case, you deserve to die!" He pounced and ate the poor lamb.

In the above story, the reasons the wolf gave were the title for him eating the lamb. With a title, the act of eating the lamb became justified. Whether the content matched the title was of no concern to him.

Many people are like wolves. Zheng Zhuang Gong of the Spring and Autumn period deliberately wanted to expel his younger brother, so he indulged him as much as possible, deliberately providing him with all kinds of conveniences to "commit many unrighteous deeds," until "Uncle finished accumulating resources, prepared armor and weapons, equipped soldiers and chariots, and was about to attack Zheng, and his mother was about to open the city gate for him," only then did he say, "It is permissible!" (meaning: there is a title now.) Thus, "he defeated Duan at Yan."

However, the difference between many people and Zheng Zhuang Gong is minimal.

### ### Mr. Has Wine and Food

— Da Jun

It sounds like a myth, but it's a fact, a moving fact: some elementary school teachers can still eat good white rice and delicious dishes every day.

Yesterday, my aunt came from the countryside. She told me about the education situation in the countryside, especially the meals of elementary school teachers. ×× Temple is a small town belonging to Nanhui County. When private elementary school teachers in Shanghai were already enacting a tragic drama of hunger and cold, elementary school teachers in ×× Temple seemed to be enacting a comedy, although it was still heartbreaking!

School started, and the children in the countryside seemed very happy, even though their fathers and brothers could no longer buy them new schoolbags or foreign leather balls. The tuition fees in rural schools have always been much lower than in urban areas, but even the small amount of tuition fees is a price paid with hard work and sweat in the eyes of farmers. The clever teachers of ×× Elementary School made the following agreement with the students' parents: each student would provide the teacher and school worker with a meal for one day per semester, and parents who were too poor would be exempt. The meal procedure was as follows: a few days in advance, the student on duty would be informed, the student would tell their parents, and on that day, all the teachers and school workers would set off. But unexpectedly, the villagers were truly respectful of teachers and valued the Way. They went to town early in the morning, bought big fish and meat, and even hung wine bottles beside the basket. Such a feast was almost like a holiday.

They had three meals a day. Breakfast was picked up from the parents on duty by the school worker, and for lunch and dinner, everyone would travel the five or six miles, regardless of wind, rain, or sunshine. ... When my aunt spoke of this, I seemed to see the farmers' sincere attitude and kind faces; but I also understood the teachers' sorrowful feelings!

My aunt also told me, "The villagers are very attentive! Before leaving, they would say, 'There's no good food, teachers, please excuse us! Is it Wu Quanfa's turn tomorrow?' Several teachers who received this kind of courtesy for the first time blushed."

### ### Miscellaneous Poems on the Lake

— Shi Shufan

Visiting Yue Fei's Tomb Late, Osmanthus Flowers Scented Profusely

Crows croak in reverence, what words do guests offer? Stiff southern branches and northern branches, Regret is often felt for what happens after death, shaking heads, writing poems of the present, the integrity of that time was unparalleled, our loyalty is also close to foolish, changes happen in the world the tomb is still green, allowing the wind to blow all over the sky.

Late osmanthus emits a clear fragrance on the high walls, I take it in with my nose and feel a bitterness in my heart, as a guest I am startled that autumn is already old, Facing the duke, I lament that there is no one like him! Who can repay the endless wishes of the East Sea? Thinking of the casual spring in Southern Capital. The stubborn iron eyebrows can speak: In my eyes, these youths are not as good as Qin Hui.

Passing South Screen

Withered ink flies disorderly, crows on the trees, old friend died in hundreds of battles in Changsha, the sun slants, passing the Honglai Mountain House, wheat flowers blooming reflected in plain. (The building is on the site of the Leifeng Pagoda ruins, I used to sit there with Mengsun drinking tea, now it is destroyed, my old friend revolted in Hengyang, and it has been nearly five years. That day his wife traveled with him.)

Boating on the Lake

Old grudges dissipated like smoke, a young woman sings the water chestnut gathering song again, Fish froth floats on the mossy clumps, a stench, weeping beside the oars, many rotten bones.

### ### The Cost of World War III

— Mao Yi

War is a costly and wasteful undertaking. In World War II, the United States alone spent 330 billion US dollars, and at the height of the war in 1944, the annual war expenditure reached as high as 90 billion US dollars. If World War III breaks out, the lives and property lost will certainly be even more considerable. The October issue of "Reader's Digest" published an article titled "The Price of Another War," in which the figures listed focus on the United States, but can also be extrapolated to estimate the total cost of the next war—if it is unavoidable.

Military Expenses—Assuming that the next war will arm 12 million people and purchase the same amount of military supplies as in 1944, it will cost 143 billion US dollars a year at current market prices. If this war lasts as long as World War II, the total cost will reach 540 billion US dollars. This is still calculated at the current value of the US dollar, and if the US dollar continues to depreciate, it will be more than this amount.

Military Supplies—The price of steel has risen by 37 percent since August 1945. The price of gasoline has more than doubled since then. The price of rubber is fluctuating wildly. The cost of raw materials and finished products in any possible new war will be at least 50 percent higher than before.

Lives—It is impossible to predict how many lives will be sacrificed if war breaks out between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, exceeding the number of casualties in World War II is beyond doubt. In World War II, 294,000 American soldiers were killed in action, and 670,000 were injured. The casualty rate on the European battlefield can be learned from Germany's experience. The German army lost 5 million killed and missing in World War II, and another 4 million were injured, most of whom were lost on the front lines against the Soviet army.

Resources—The United States consumed more than 5 billion tons of the best minerals and about 8 billion barrels of gasoline in World War II. The next war will consume even more resources. By the end of the war, the United States will become a "have-nothing" country.

Freedom—In order to control manpower, laws may be enacted to "join the war or work," applicable to people under the age of 65. Strikes are illegal, wages are controlled, and occupations cannot be changed arbitrarily. Rationing and price controls are implemented. The production of civilian goods stops, and military contracts have priority everywhere.

Aftermath—World War II increased debt to 220 billion US dollars, and interest, veterans' benefits, and pensions became a heavy burden on the people. If World War III breaks out, the debt will reach 300 billion US dollars. Interest and veterans' benefits and pensions will naturally be even more enormous.

### ### God of Wealth

— Shi Ming

I went to a printing house by chance to find a friend. I saw that they were printing a colorful picture, in the middle of which was a portrait of an ancient warrior with a dark complexion and a beard around his cheeks, holding a steel whip in his hand, with a tiger squatting beside him. I didn't know who the person in the portrait was. If he was Wu Song, who fought tigers, the scene didn't look like tiger fighting, and the tiger wasn't baring its teeth and claws. Who was the person in the picture? I couldn't help but ask my friend. My friend told me that this was the God of Wealth, for the reason that the New Year was approaching, so they were doing a bit of speculative business, printing them in preparation for people to buy them and paste them in their halls or on their doors. I couldn't help but feel some doubt. The God of Wealth should be holding gold bars and banknotes, with an abacus and ledger beside him, and he should be refined and elegant. The picture is so different, it's really a bit baffling! My friend also told me that there are two types of Gods of Wealth, civil and military. The one in the picture is the military God of Wealth. I seemed to understand a little, but I still felt that it wasn't quite right, so I said: That's right! The civil God of Wealth earns money with an abacus and ledger. The military God of Wealth is a green forest hero, so he should be holding a pistol. My friend laughed when he heard this, saying that I only knew one thing but not the other, saying that this picture has a special subtlety, and told me to think about it.

I sat silently beside him, smoked half a cigarette, and remembered. In this day and age, to get rich, you must first hoard goods. Those who hoard paper are called "paper tigers," those who deal in gold and foreign exchange are called "gold tigers," and the government cracking down on these hoarders is called "fighting tigers," so the God of Wealth and tigers have a considerable relationship. The God of Wealth has tigers around him, and those who kowtow to the God of Wealth are willing to submit to the God of Wealth and be tigers at his feet. The God of Wealth raises tigers, so the God of Wealth must protect the tigers, holding a steel whip, ready to resist those who fight tigers.

My friend clapped his hands and said I was right when he heard what I said.

### ### Pigpen Direction

In this time when public school employees are crying from hunger and cold, schools are closed here, and workers are lazy there, with no difference between north and south, and universal grief in all directions, I suddenly saw a telegram from Nanjing that the government will issue 35 yuan per person for winter clothing expenses this month, which is considered a thoughtful gesture from the government. The mention of "winter clothing" is full of poetic meaning, "everywhere the sound of knives and rulers hurrying to make winter clothes," "how can I get thousands of mansions to shelter all the poor scholars in the world and make them happy," those who read these lines have always felt a surge of sympathy, especially with the reality of the approaching harsh winter before their eyes, and the cries of hardship ringing throughout the land. Seeing these two words, who wouldn't feel a thousand emotions!

The "winter clothing expenses" is a good intention, but if we talk about the facts, let me briefly describe the clothing prices in the former capital. The cheapest clothing markets are in Tianqiao and the small markets in the east, west, north cities. A thin quilt costs 90 gold yuan, a cotton robe that is six or seven tenths new costs 70 or 80 yuan, and a small padded jacket and cotton trousers cost 30 yuan or so. The goods in the so-called "used clothing stalls" and "old clothing sheds" are mostly old (sourced from pawnshops and drum stalls), or cheaply made new items, so the prices are cheaper. If you buy new materials from silk and cloth stores and have tailors make new clothes, the labor and material costs will be three or four times or six or seven times higher than "used clothing."

A coat at the used clothing stall that looks decent (thick enough to keep out the cold) costs 150 or 160 yuan, and leather clothes and leather tubes were the main items on the market at this time last year. Fox, sheep, mink, everything was available. An ordinary sheepskin robe with a completely new lining and clean fur and bottom cost no more than 700,000 or 800,000 yuan, and a fox tube with a satin surface that was eight or nine tenths new cost no more than 2 million yuan. But at this time this year, there are only a few leather goods stalls, and in a vast public market, only worn-out sheepskin and smelly dog and wolf skin can be seen. If there is a slightly neat sheepskin robe that is six or seven tenths new, it costs 300 or 400 gold yuan, and people rush to buy it. Fox fur is not seen for three or five days, and if it is seen, it is being sold by one or two women who are selling it because their families are in urgent need of money, but the asking price is always 1 million or 2 million yuan, and who dares to inquire! Therefore, even if there is such goods, it is difficult to sell.

Sheepskin is easy to sell but there is a shortage of goods, because leather robes can save coal, so those who have them at home are unwilling to sell them. If there are any for sale in the market, they are snatched up immediately. Stallholders have goods in hand, hoarding and waiting for an opportunity, hiding them and not showing them. Therefore, the serious situation of "winter clothing" this year is no less than that of food!
