### America to Send Delegation to China; Joint Conference Committee Passes Compromise Foreign Aid Bill; to be Executed after Presidential Signature

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The US Senate and House of Representatives Joint Conference Committee passed a $6,098,000,000 global aid bill on the evening of the 1st, which stipulates $338,000,000 for economic aid to China and another $125,000,000 as a gift to China; the latter gift can be used by the Chinese government for military purposes. The term of the entire aid to China plan is one year. The aforementioned bill was passed after 11:00 PM on the 1st and has already been sent to the two houses of Congress, which will quickly pass this compromise plan on the morning of the 2nd and send it to the White House for President Truman to sign. The Joint Conference Committee deleted part of the clauses regarding the purpose of the bill in the Senate's aid to China plan and changed the amount of aid before passing the plan. The economic aid granted to China in the Senate's aid to China plan was reduced by $25,000,000 to $338,000,000, but the amount given to China that can be used by the Chinese government for military purposes was increased to $125,000,000. The Joint Conference Committee also passed the House's proposal to establish a "Sino-American Joint Rural Reconstruction Committee" and stipulate that 5% to 10% of the economic aid to China be used for rural reconstruction in China. Before Congress appropriates funds to implement the aid to China plan, the Reconstruction Bank will advance $50,000,000. The Joint Conference Committee also passed its preface regarding the purpose of aiding China. The deleted preface to the Senate's aid to China bill stated: "Aid to China is necessary to alleviate the suffering of the people, delay economic deterioration, and give China the opportunity to revive its economy through self-help." The new preface states: The purpose and policy of the United States in granting aid to China is, first, to encourage China and its people to exert their long-term joint efforts to accelerate the completion of domestic peace and economic stability; second, to encourage China to maintain true independence and the integrity of its government; and third, to maintain and strengthen individual freedom and free institutions through aid programs based on self-help and cooperation. Aid to China will be conducted in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act in all aid bills, including the European Recovery Program. This means that economic aid to China will be implemented by the same executor who manages the European Recovery Program. The United States will send a delegation to China to ensure the effective implementation of its plan. Aid will be based on a bilateral agreement. The aid to China bill does not stipulate the specific tasks that China will agree to in the bilateral agreement to ensure that the above funds are effectively used for the purpose of the bill; but the bill specifically stipulates that China should take various measures to improve commercial relations between the two countries. The provisions in the bilateral agreements between the United States and the countries in the European Recovery Program, such as increasing production, stabilizing currency, and assisting in the transportation of strategic materials to the United States, will serve as a guide for the Sino-American agreement negotiations. The aid to China bill only stipulates that $125,000,000 will be given completely to the Chinese government and does not mention military aid. Therefore, it can be said that the bill does not make any commitments to military aid to China. The economic plan, as outlined by the Congressional Committee, will include important imported materials purchased with funds granted or loaned at the discretion of the economic plan executor. The executor can also decide on the rural construction plans that are about to be undertaken. All foreign aid bills also approve: (1) $5.3 billion for the European Recovery Program, which must be approved and appropriated annually, (2) $275 million for military aid to Turkey and Greece, and (3) $60 million for the International Children's Emergency Relief Fund.

### National Assembly to Hold Fifth Preparatory Meeting Today; Formally Elect Presidium; Election Method Amended and Passed Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Assembly held its fourth preparatory meeting at 9:25 AM on the 2nd, amending and passing three articles of the election method for the presidium of the assembly:

(1) The presidium consists of 85 members, who will be elected by the delegates to the assembly from the general list of presidium candidates using an anonymous ballot method. Those with more votes will be elected, and in the event of a tie, lots will be drawn to determine the winner.

(2) The general list of presidium candidates will be composed of candidates generated by the following methods: 1 Each representative unit will elect one candidate, not limited to representatives generated by the unit. When each unit elects presidium candidates, the oldest representative in each unit will convene the election.

2 Ten representatives may jointly nominate one candidate, but each representative is limited to one nomination.

(3) These measures will be implemented after being approved by the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly.

The meeting was still temporarily chaired by Yu Bin. Hong Lanyou read the original letter from the Office of the Civil Service of the National Government, the original submission from the Legislative Yuan, and the National Government's order announcing the amendment of Article 5 of the National Assembly's Organizational Law. Chairman Yu then stated: The number of presidium members has been legally amended from 25 to 85. Next, the method of generating candidates was discussed. Representatives successively spoke or submitted written opinions, reaching 93 people. At 11:00 AM, Chairman Yu announced the cessation of speeches. The opinions submitted afterwards that had not been read will also be considered by the Secretary-General and the Chairman when studying all opinions. After a break, Chairman Yu presented a general new draft and explained that attention should be paid to the mutual election regulations in the Organizational Law, and the opinions of each unit being able to generate a chairman should also be taken into account. However, a small number of representatives insisted that each unit should elect separately, and the units should also be subdivided. Representative Sun Shengwu proposed changing the anonymous multiple-vote method in the first article of Chairman Yu's draft to a single-vote method to make it easier for unit representatives to be generated. Xie Chengping, a representative of the Youth Party, also spoke in favor of Chairman Yu's draft. Finally, after Chairman Yu asked the meeting to speed up the meeting process and conduct a vote, Representative Sun Shengwu's amended draft was approved by a majority of 1,241 out of 2,061 representatives present. Mo Dehui was then selected as the chairman of the fifth preparatory meeting, and the meeting adjourned at 12:10 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Assembly will adjourn on the morning of the 3rd to carry out the work of electing the presidium.

It is expected that the election can be completed before 4:00 PM on the 3rd, and the fifth preparatory meeting will be held at 4:00 PM to formally elect the presidium.

### Dispute Over Signature of National Assembly Delegates to be Resolved Flexibly

So That Those Elected Can Attend the Assembly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The dispute over the withdrawal of signatures by National Assembly delegates is gradually showing signs of resolution. Chen Lifu, Hu Shi, Yu Bin, and others have been discussing with the signatory representatives for several days, and the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party have also been in contact. The general approach will be to adopt a flexible method so that those elected as signatory representatives can still attend the assembly. This method must be approved by the National Assembly. On the 2nd, some representatives have signed and submitted proposals, requesting the assembly to resolve that the elected signatory representatives be allowed to attend the assembly. It is heard that this proposal has been agreed upon by all parties, but the technical problem of how to get it approved by the National Assembly will be discussed. Among the ten representatives on hunger strike, Su Mingfang and Yang Shilin have been eating for two days and attended the assembly. The remaining eight are still on hunger strike, but are slightly taking fruit. On the morning of the 2nd, He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, and others went to persuade them to eat. Zhang Fu, who is the weakest, has slightly taken milk, but is still on hunger strike in the afternoon. Yu Bin visited the hunger-striking representatives again at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to persuade them to eat.

### Decisive Battle to Take Place in Eastern Henan; Situation Around Fuyang in Northern Anhui Improves; Bandit Troops Cross Xiang River by Force on Border of Hubei and Shaanxi

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 2nd] Yan Zuyi, Chief of Staff of the Xun Command Headquarters, told our reporter at noon on the 2nd: The bandits Liu and Chen's siege of Fuyang was originally exploratory. Now that they have encountered setbacks, they are bound to flee in a panic. Xu pointed out that another larger-scale battle is brewing in eastern Henan a month ago. The first, second, and tenth columns of Liu's bandits have gathered near Xincai, attempting to make a major move. The National Army has completed a new deployment and began attacking the bandit army on the morning of the 2nd. A decisive battle may break out within a week. When asked about the bandits' intentions, Xu smiled and said that this move may be to support the Fuyang battle, intending to attack in the east and strike in the west. Now that the situation in Fuyang has improved, the bandits in Xincai may invade Runan and Queshan in the west, fleeing back to the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. However, the National Army is prepared and will not find it difficult to crush them. It is also judged that after this battle unfolds, the bandits near Fuyang will inevitably retreat without being attacked.

### Chronicles of the National Assembly: It's Hard to Step Down, Difficult to Ascend

Special Dispatch from This Newspaper (Nanjing, April 2nd)

The preparatory meeting has been going on for four days, and the presidium still hasn't been formed. The presidium has the opportunity to sit on the platform, and some people hope to ascend, but the difficulties are numerous. Those who have sat on the platform before, like Hu Shih and Yu Bin, when the attendees were speaking, calling out, and even pointing fingers at the chair, felt that stepping down was not easy. Bishop Yu Bin, while stealing a moment of leisure, quietly wiped the sweat from his forehead, perhaps thinking, "I can't get away from stepping down, why are you all so bravely demanding to ascend the platform?" It wasn't until 12:10 that it was announced that Mo Dehui would chair the fifth preparatory meeting, and Bishop Yu must have felt relieved.

Although today's meeting was the most peaceful and uneventful, with less chaos and no booing, this only resolution was achieved by the loud appeals of Lin Zigui, a representative from the Fujian region. The chair had intended to put the revised draft of the presidium election method to a vote, and just as the representatives were preparing to press the buttons, someone loudly accused the chair of misinterpreting the articles and misinterpreting the opinions of the representatives over the past three days. Bishop Yu's face turned ashen, and he almost couldn't step down. The time had reached 12 o'clock, which was the legal recess period. Sun Shengwu suggested: "Submit the opinions of the representatives to the secretariat for comprehensive arrangement, taking into account both the units and the talents, and put forward a three-day meeting for discussion." This was originally a way to resolve the situation, but the mood of the attendees could not be resolved by this. Lin Zigui jumped up from his seat, pointed at the microphone, and shouted: "Please pay attention, everyone! Every day we hold a meeting here, the national treasury loses more than 7 billion. How can we hold a meeting for a day without any results? Today, no matter how late we have to continue, we must finish the discussion!" His words were quite effective and also helped Chairman Yu. So Yu Bin immediately seized this popular sentiment: "Judging by everyone's intention, you don't want to break up without any results. Now let's try it out, first put the second draft to a vote. If it doesn't pass, then put the first draft to a vote. Even if both plans don't pass, we can still formulate a third draft." After a unanimous applause, the voting machines emitted colorful lights, with 2141 votes against 820 votes, the second draft passed by a majority. Some people still wanted to speak, but Yu Bin had to find an opportunity to step down himself: "The extended time is up, the meeting is adjourned!"

After the National Assembly Organization Law was revised and passed by the Legislative Yuan to have 85 members in the presidium, the presidium election method originally proposed by the preparatory committee was no longer applicable. Chairman Yu Bin hoped to gather public opinion and let the representatives speak freely. The speech slips flew to the chair like snowflakes at three o'clock, and soon piled up very high. Some representatives were unwilling to speak themselves, so they wrote their opinions on paper and asked the secretary-general to read them on their behalf. This was hard on Hong Lanyou, whose throat was already hoarse. For almost an hour, he sang a solo show, and fortunately, some people still wanted to speak themselves, so Hong Lanyou had the opportunity to drink a cup of tea. Yu Bin said: "Many people have the same opinions, so later only new opinions will be read, and those without new opinions will only have their names read," which also rescued Hong Lanyou. Yu and Hong on the platform were considerate and helpful to each other, cooperating to the most satisfactory extent.

The opinions of nearly a hundred representatives mostly had a consistent view. First, it is hoped that each unit will have a representative to participate in the presidium. Second, the six units in the free professional groups should individually produce chairpersons to participate in the presidium. Third, direct election, each unit separately elects, no need for a general list. Fourth, regarding the surplus beyond one person per unit, some advocated increasing the number proportionally to the number of people in the unit, and some advocated a general election for the surplus. Fifth, for each unit election, two or three times the number of candidates can be nominated, but each unit counts votes separately, ensuring that each unit has one person participating in the presidium. Regarding the quota for women, some advocated separate counting, and one representative even advocated "separate voting for men and women." In addition, the most noteworthy opinion is that "incumbent senior officials should not be candidates for the chair of the National Assembly." Xie Hongxuan said: "Incumbent senior officials participating in the presidium have the suspicion of exercising the powers of the National Assembly on their behalf!" Some applauded, some hissed. No matter what these opinions were, their purpose was the same: "Ascend the platform!" Even if someone ascends the platform and declares that they will never be the chairman, or even cites the precedent of being elected and resigning from the Constituent National Assembly, they are extremely rare.

The chairman is hardworking, and he cannot rest during breaks. He hastily drafted the first draft of the election method. Yu Bin explained that this accommodated the opinions of the representatives, but he insisted on the "mutual election" point and did not stipulate the method of self-election by each unit. The draft method was generally in line with the opinions put forward by Pan Gongzhan and others. On the one hand, each unit elects one candidate, and on the other hand, ten representatives can jointly nominate one person. Yu Bin's method was to use an anonymous cumulative voting method, which not only made it difficult to be elected, but also increased the technical difficulties in counting votes. Someone shouted against it, saying that someone was manipulating it and completely ignored the opinions discussed by everyone for three days. What was that opinion? Each unit elects one person on its own. Yu Bin patiently explained on the platform that he did not distort or manipulate, and according to the revised opinions, he changed the anonymous cumulative voting method to an anonymous single voting method, and put forward a second draft, so that anyone with 25 votes could be elected.

In any case, the second draft was finally passed. Although some people were still dissatisfied, Zi Bin stepped down and sighed deeply. For three days, he didn't have to ascend the platform, but according to the passed election method, on the afternoon and evening of the second and the morning of the third, I don't know how many people were vying for the opportunity to ascend the platform.

### Editorial: The Theme of the Pan-American Conference

The Ninth Pan-American Conference opened in the capital of Colombia on March 30th and is proceeding according to the agenda. It has now touched on the core of the conference's agenda; the 21 representatives are deeply aware of the danger of communist forces infiltrating all parts of the world, and the need for countries in the Western Hemisphere to work together to strengthen ties. On the opening day of the conference, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall raised the issue of "investigating secret activities by foreign countries against the institutions, peace, and security of American countries," which was unanimously supported by the representatives of the participating countries. From this, it can be seen that the interests of the Pan-American countries are closely related. Therefore, we have sufficient reason to believe that this Pan-American Conference will achieve satisfactory results.

In terms of the agenda of this Pan-American Conference, the most important are the following three: (1) Establishing a permanent American Defense Committee to implement the Pan-American Mutual Defense Treaty signed in the capital of Brazil in September last year; this treaty was approved by the U.S. Congress on December 8th last year. (2) Signing a Pan-American Economic Cooperation Agreement. Latin American countries, for their own economic recovery, all need the assistance of American capital, machinery, and equipment, so everyone hopes that Marshall can also propose a "Marshall Plan" similar to the "European Aid Plan." (3) Establishing a Pan-American Peace System, so that any disputes between American countries can be resolved peacefully. From the above three points, on the one hand, we can know the importance of this Pan-American Conference. In addition to military issues, there are even more important economic issues; therefore, the U.S. delegation of more than 90 people, in addition to Secretary of State Marshall, also includes Secretary of Commerce Harriman and Export-Import Bank President Martin, which shows the importance that the U.S. government attaches to this Pan-American Conference. On the other hand, it can also be known that since the United States wants to obtain the full cooperation of the Pan-American countries in military affairs, the United States must give considerable satisfaction to the wishes of the Pan-American countries in economic terms. U.S. economic assistance to Latin American countries is absolutely no problem in principle; however, at present, the focus of U.S. foreign aid is concentrated in Europe, and whether Latin American countries can also have a "Marshall Plan" at the same time is an important issue.

Looking back at the Pan-American Conference held in the capital of Brazil last year, the Mexican representative, Foreign Minister Bo Taite, repeatedly emphasized the importance of economic cooperation between American countries, and the implication was self-evident. Because since 1942, the total amount of loans lent by the United States to Latin American countries under the Lend-Lease Act was only 796 million U.S. dollars; however, this loan has long been used up; because during the war, the United States concentrated its national manpower and material resources to fight against Germany and Japan; therefore, Latin American countries naturally did not find it convenient to ask the United States for loans all the time. But since the end of the war, the situation has changed, and the need for U.S. dollars in Latin American countries has also increased day by day. In order to seek domestic economic recovery, it is necessary to obtain U.S. economic assistance. What Foreign Minister Bo Taite called economic cooperation refers to "U.S. aid"; however, the U.S. representative has always insisted on first discussing the issue of joint defense of the Western Hemisphere, with the intention that economic cooperation cannot be discussed without first implementing military cooperation. Therefore, the representatives of Latin American countries also followed the wishes of the United States and completed this Pan-American Mutual Defense Treaty; and the issue of economic cooperation was left for future consideration, so the theme of this Pan-American Conference is the issue of economic cooperation.

But since the end of the conference in the capital of Brazil, the U.S. authorities believed that the defense of the Western Hemisphere was no longer a problem since the Pan-American Mutual Defense Treaty had been completed. Therefore, its attention has been focused on Europe. In addition to implementing the Truman Doctrine in Greece and Turkey, the Marshall Plan is also being actively implemented. First, the Emergency Aid to Europe Act was passed by Congress, and now Congress is discussing a large-scale long-term aid to Europe plan, the enormous amount of U.S. dollars required is unprecedented. How can it not arouse the envy of Latin American countries? We studied the psychology of the representatives of Latin American countries and can say that it is completely like this: The United States wants the Western Hemisphere to implement joint defense, and wants the Latin American countries to unanimously support the United States' new anti-Soviet policy. There is no problem in principle; but there is one condition, that is, the United States must also have a "Marshall Plan" for the Latin American countries. According to the report of the United Press, the Colombian representative has proposed a "small Marshall Plan," advocating that the United States lend 5 billion U.S. dollars, managed by an international financial company, for Latin American countries to increase production. Based on this, Marshall's plan to ask Congress to allocate 500 million U.S. dollars to lend to Latin American countries may not be able to satisfy the wishes of Latin American countries. Marshall repeatedly explained the current difficulties of the United States in his speech at the meeting, and asked for the understanding of the Pan-American countries. He said: "Although the United States is prepared to expand the scale of its economic assistance to American countries over the years, in view of the urgent demands in other areas, the contribution that the United States can provide can only include a small part of the development needs of American countries. Therefore, the American countries still need to rely on and encourage domestic and foreign private investment. Assuming that the basic rights and freedoms of mankind are violated in Europe, the New World will also increase its unease. This matter is as deeply related to your country as it is to the United States." The representatives of Latin American countries, after hearing Marshall's "Europe First" theory, I am afraid that only one in ten can express satisfaction!

Looking forward to the future of the Pan-American Conference, although it can proceed smoothly, especially the United States' anti-communist policy will certainly gain the sympathy of most countries, because in Latin American countries, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has always been in favor of the United States' tough approach to the Soviet Union. As the saying goes, "to resist foreign aggression, one must first pacify the domestic front." Marshall came with this mission, asking the countries of the Western Hemisphere to strengthen unity, implement joint defense, and unanimously resist foreign aggression. Naturally, he will not fail to live up to his mission; but in the process of the conference, unexpected twists and turns are inevitable. Because under the principle of "Europe First," if the Pan-American countries cannot obtain huge economic assistance from the United States, then whether in terms of emotion or in fact, they will inevitably show a slight Han attitude towards the military cooperation required by the United States. This is the only hidden reef of the Pan-American Conference. Whether Marshall can avoid touching the reef and make the Pan-American Conference a complete success depends on whether Marshall can avoid adhering to prejudices and making selfish plans.

Starting yesterday, they have begun to solicit the signatures and nominations of National Assembly representatives. There are no words of praise in the signing book. The front is just a few simple words: "According to the provisions of Article 4 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election and Removal Law promulgated by the National Government on March 31, 1936, we jointly nominate the current President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, as a presidential candidate." It is said that this is also the position of President Ju himself. He tried his best to avoid propaganda with praise in the signing of the nomination.

Non-Action Government

Contains Positive Significance

President Ju's usual proposition is "non-action government". When the reporter asked him to express his campaign platform, he always avoided talking about the specific problems of the current political situation. When some questions were mentioned, he did not want to publish them publicly in the newspaper. Regarding the explanation of "non-action government", he said: "Non-action government" is not inaction, but not acting rashly. "People have things they don't do, and then they can have things they can do", so "non-action government" seems passive on the surface, but it still contains positive significance in essence. Mr. Ju is running for president, and he said that "non-action government" is his campaign platform. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the president is only the head of state. If responsibility is implemented at different levels and the system is adhered to, it would be good for the president to achieve "non-action government". The reporter repeatedly asked him what the first thing he would do after being elected president. In addition to humbly saying that he would not be elected, he always said: What to do should be the responsibility of the president of the Executive Yuan. At the same time, although Mr. Ju is unwilling to talk about political views on political reform, he also deeply holds concerns about the current state of the country. The revolution has been reformed for decades, and the Principle of People's Livelihood has not yet been implemented. Mr. Ju advocates that under the current situation, quelling the chaos should be the first priority, seeking stability from quelling the chaos, and seeking construction from stability, but political reform should also be a top priority. When the reporter asked him whether political reform should start from the central government or from the local government, Mr. Ju held a different opinion from Mr. Li Zongren and replied: It should start with local reform. If the grass-roots politics is not reformed, it is useless to rely solely on central reform. The Outline of National Reconstruction stipulates that provincial autonomy will be completed only after the autonomy of each county is completed. It can be seen that political reform must be from the bottom up.

Facing Good Urging

I Will Not Be Active

For the presidential election, Mr. Ju has always advocated adopting a "non-action government" approach. Except for his friends who are conducting election activities for him, he himself is unwilling to conduct any activities. He especially emphasized to the reporter: "I will never treat guests! I will never spend money!" Even whether to invite reporters to publish his campaign platform once is still under consideration. Among the friends who are active in campaigning for him, some advocate adopting a no-publicity approach. They are also doing things based on President Ju's proposition. Xie Guansheng once said to President Ju: He even thinks that a press conference may not be necessary. In the heat of the vice-presidential election, President Ju was the first person to announce his candidacy for president. Mr. Ju is already 73 years old. In terms of revolutionary merit, he should not give way to running for president, but he repeatedly humbly said: "The president is really none other than Chairman Chiang!"

### US, Britain, and France Issue Warning to the Soviet Union: No Interference with Berlin Airlift; Otherwise, Armed Escort Will Be Forced

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] The commanders of the British, American, and French zones have prepared a note, which was submitted to the Soviet authorities at noon on the 2nd. It will state that any attempt by the Soviet Union to control air traffic in and out of Berlin indicates a "shooting incident". When revealing the aforementioned news, authoritative sources also confirmed that although the British side does not intend to protect passenger planes with fighter planes, if the Soviet side refuses the three powers' request not to interfere with the airlift, armed escort will be unavoidable. It is said that the note from the three powers will state that the note does not have a strictly final customs clearance nature, but observers do not understand how diplomatic rhetoric can conceal the true and serious significance of the note.

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Berlin and the western occupied areas currently rely solely on air routes for communication, and the atmosphere in the city is very tense. The Soviet Union has stationed sentries at various road junctions, equipped with tanks, jeeps, and other equipment, to prevent the passage of cars and buses. In addition, there are rumors that the Soviet army is busy mobilizing. People close to the Soviet authorities expect that the Soviet Union will soon control air traffic, but as of 1:00 PM, nine of the twenty-two American transport planes originally scheduled to fly to Berlin have safely arrived in Berlin.

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] British military sources have recently confirmed that when British planes flew over the Soviet military area of Berlin, Soviet fighter planes dived or hovered near them once or twice, but when protesting to the Soviet authorities, the Soviet side denied the incident. American planes have also encountered similar incidents when flying to Berlin. A British spokesman solemnly denied that the British side had ever considered escorting with fighter planes.

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] The head of the Soviet intelligence agency, Shabanov, told Germans in Walled City in the Soviet military area that a large number of spies from the British and American areas were sneaking into Berlin and transferring to other places in the Soviet area to spy on military, political, and economic news. The Soviet Union can no longer tolerate the "plunder" of Berlin by the British and Americans.

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] The four-power deputy commanders of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union in Berlin held their weekly routine meeting as usual today, but the Soviet Union's intensified control of traffic was not on the agenda. In addition, the four-power joint military government in Berlin is still continuing its normal activities.

### US and Britain Pay Attention to the Berlin Incident: Soviet Union Strengthens Border Traffic Control, US Planes Airlift Food to Supply Military and Civilians

[Report from this newspaper] London, 2nd broadcast: The Soviet Union is intensifying its blockade of Berlin, and even railway transportation will be affected. Twenty-three American military aircraft have landed at Dengbelhof Airport, carrying food to supply residents in the American-occupied area of Berlin. Another six or seven planes will arrive soon. In addition, five American passenger planes have arrived. British trains carrying food passed through the Soviet-occupied area and were only subjected to ordinary inspections. The Soviet side did not obstruct the movement of aircraft. Judging from various signs, the Soviet blockade is unlikely to ease, because after Britain and the United States protested, the Soviet Union declared, "We will not change what we have already decided."

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Regarding the Soviet Union's control of traffic between Berlin and West Germany, diplomatic officials here believe this is the beginning of the Soviet Union's attempt to force Western countries to withdraw from Berlin. General Clay, the commander of the US forces in Berlin, has the right to take all countermeasures, and the State Department reiterated the US's determination to stay in Berlin. Some people believe that Clay's actions will not go beyond the established policy of the US government. The State Department and the Department of Defense do not show any signs of panic and seem to hope that this serious dispute can be resolved locally without escalating to an unmanageable level. However, Berlin has long been regarded as a testing ground for US-Soviet foreign policy, with crises lurking on all sides. If both sides are forced to show their cards, it is related to their own prestige, especially at a time when the United States is guaranteeing that European countries will resist Soviet expansion.

[Reuters, London, 1st] British Foreign Office officials are very indignant at the developments in Berlin and are prepared to take a firm stand, but what kind of action will be taken has not yet been decided. The Western countries have not yet obtained any legal basis to deal with the Soviet Union's traffic control measures. Officials from the German Department of the Foreign Office pointed out that the four-power written agreement only stipulates the four-power occupation and joint management of Berlin and does not prohibit any country from inspecting personnel entering and exiting. The Soviet Union's move has undoubtedly gone far beyond the spirit of the four-power understanding, but it is expected that it will be difficult to achieve results if the Western countries negotiate with them on this basis. Moreover, the measures taken by the Soviet Union in Berlin have already been implemented in the Soviet military area of Yue country, and the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have not previously expressed any objection. This is also one of the reasons why it is inconvenient for the Western countries to take a tough attitude.

[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 2nd] The struggle between the East and West in Berlin caused great anxiety in the United Nations on the 2nd. Generally, it is feared that the great powers will show their cards in Berlin, which will have a serious or even unmanageable impact on the United Nations. The possibility of submitting the traffic dispute to and from Berlin to the Security Council or the General Assembly is almost zero. It is believed that even if the issue is raised, the United Nations will not be able to do anything.

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] A British military train, after being blocked for twenty hours at the Marienborn station on the border of the Soviet-occupied area, returned to Berlin on the morning of the 2nd. Shortly after the British train left Marienborn, the Soviet authorities closed the 100-mile railway between Berlin and the Soviet-occupied area checkpoint of Vulsfeide, prohibiting traffic at night and requiring special permits for traffic during the day. The military trains carrying coal from the Ruhr to Berlin all take this route. At the same time, it is learned that the families of twelve German railway staff members near Marienborn station have been ordered to move out by the Soviet authorities to provide housing for Soviet border troops. The 800 residents of Walteich Village, five miles north of Marienborn, have also been ordered to move out to provide housing for Soviet troops. According to the German News Agency, the obstacles set up by the Soviet army at one intersection of the crossroads on the side of the Gedo airfield on the edge of the British military area in Berlin were removed on the night of the 1st, and the other three intersections are still blocked by the British army. The Soviet authorities have lifted the control of the transportation of goods from the Soviet area to other areas in Berlin on the night of the 1st, but well-informed sources said that the Soviet authorities will implement stricter control next Monday. Two US military transport planes, carrying 15,000 pounds of food needed by the US military personnel in Berlin from the US military area of Germany, safely arrived at the Tanbu Erhof Airport in the US military area of Berlin on the night of the 1st.

### News Conference Passes Peacetime News Censorship Case: Freedom of the Press Principles to Be Voted On

[Reuters, Geneva, 1st] The Soviet Union today formally recommended to the International Conference on Freedom of the Press that all advocates of fascist propaganda or any form of aggressor should not enjoy the right to freedom of thought and expression. The Soviet Union is making amendments to a resolution on freedom of the press principles proposed by the United States. British representative 台夫斯 pointed out that the words in the US resolution condemning all monopolies, especially government monopolies, are equivalent to prohibiting the "British Broadcasting Corporation". He suggested deleting the aforementioned words. The conference will vote on the 2nd on the US resolution and the British and Soviet amendments. The conference today also passed that peacetime news censorship should be prohibited unless it is necessary for military security. Peacetime news censorship should meet six conditions, including that reporters must be informed of the conditions of censorship in advance, and that reporters must not suffer unnecessary delays and expenses. These six effects were passed by a vote of nineteen to six against Eastern Europe.

### US Congress Joint Resolution: Repeal Aid to Spain Plan

[United Press Washington 1st dispatch] The joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives voted today that unless the six countries of Western Europe independently invite the Spanish government to participate, the country will not be included in the Marshall Plan for European Recovery. This resolution was made less than an hour after an official announcement that Marshall was completely opposed to Spain being included in the aid program. The Senate has already rejected inviting Spain to participate, and heated debate is expected when the House reconsiders the matter, but it is generally expected that the joint committee's resolution will be accepted in the end. The committee is currently continuing to discuss the $6.205 billion foreign aid bill passed by the House last night, attempting to reconcile the differences between the two houses regarding the portion for aid to China.

### Marshall Asks South American Countries to Prevent the Spread of Communism, Accuses the Soviet Union of Threatening World Peace

[Central News Agency, Bogota, 1st United Press Dispatch] Marshall recently condemned the Soviet Union for preventing the world from achieving peace and called on South American countries to contribute to the Marshall Plan to help the United States contain the spread of communism in Europe. He told the second plenary session of the Ninth Pan-American Conference: "If human rights and freedoms disappear in Europe, they will also become insecure in the New World." Marshall did not give any hints on what kind of action the conference should take to contain communism. When he focused on discussing economic issues, he gave South American countries bad news, namely that they cannot expect to receive any special assistance from the United States. In addition to his prepared speech, Marshall made an impassioned statement, saying that the United States is spending billions on military construction to defend the entire Western Hemisphere against subversive actions.

### Finnish Negotiating Representatives: Two Recalled Home

[Reuters Helsinki 2nd dispatch] Finnish President Paasikivi abruptly telegraphed two members of the Finnish delegation negotiating a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union in Moscow last night, namely Kikkonen of the Agrarian League and Söderhjelm of the Swedish People's Party, to return to Helsinki to meet with the cabinet on the 3rd.

### Truman Requests Congress to Increase Defense Spending

Needs 3 Billion Yuan to Add Military Equipment

[Reuters Washington 1st dispatch] President Truman authorized Defense Secretary Forrestal today to prepare detailed estimates for $3 billion to add to US military equipment during the fiscal year from September 1948 to June 1949. In a letter to House Speaker Martin, the President pointed out that this additional $3 billion is necessary to meet the United States' international responsibilities. Truman also asked Congress to approve an appropriation of $375 million for the next fiscal year for the Federal Supply Bureau to order strategic materials. Truman's letter pointed out that the United States, with its foreign aid program and the increase of its military strength, will be able to reduce international tensions and move towards the goal of achieving a reasonable and lasting peace.

[United Press Washington 1st dispatch] The House today passed an additional military spending bill of $324 million by a vote of 339 to 3, of which $150 million was given to the original Tenth Army Committee, and the rest was for occupation troop expenses and the construction of the Alaskan military highway. The bill has been sent to the Senate for discussion.

### Clapp Returns to America, Farewell Remarks State Massive Aid to Japan is Coming, Clapp Will Urge Japan to Restore Peaceful Economic Foundation

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd dispatch] Clapp, the Undersecretary of the Army, in his farewell remarks this afternoon, told the Japanese people that the US government is currently considering a bill that, if passed by Congress, will allow a steady stream of raw materials to be shipped to Japan in large quantities. However, Clapp warned that the next few years will definitely be extremely difficult, and the Japanese people should shoulder the responsibility for the country's economic recovery.

It is reported that Clapp and his delegation arrived here on March 20 and, after a thorough two-week inspection, took a plane back to the United States at 5:00 pm.

[United Press Tokyo 2nd dispatch] The Clapp delegation will leave here on the 2nd to return to the United States and submit a "solution from the industrial sector" to the US government regarding Japan's economic problems. Sources close to the delegation said that the report will propose a plan for the United States to restore the Japanese economy to a peacetime basis even before a peace treaty is concluded. The delegation, headed by US Undersecretary of the Army Clapp, will submit it to the Secretary of the Army in Washington.

Japanese Minister of Transportation Okazaki had requested Undersecretary of the Army Clapp to lease American ships. Recent developments, although the delegation did not reach any conclusions, have provided several indications that the United States may grant such permission.

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo 2nd dispatch] The Japanese government submitted a bill to the Diet on the 2nd, requesting the establishment of a Maritime Safety Agency, which includes a coast guard of 120 patrol boats and 10,000 sailors.

(7) My Relationship with General Stilwell

If I can manage to analyze it, my three-year dispute with General Stilwell was due more to a conflict of methods than to a conflict of personalities. His dispute with the Chinese Central Government, on the other hand, was a combination of both.

I know that General Stilwell, based on information from his subordinates, believed that I made the Chinese oppose him. This is not surprising. It is not easy for a superior officer to believe that he is not well-liked because of himself.

But I am convinced that his ability and method of dealing with Chinese leaders was the main factor in his failure and the disruption of Sino-American wartime cooperation between 1942 and 1944.

From the beginning, General Stilwell never concealed his dislike for me and for the Chinese leaders he dealt with, so it was not easy for me to treat him as a friend.

I have a longer and more intimate practical understanding of the Sino-Japanese War than any other American, but General Stilwell never consulted me on any important issue regarding Sino-American military relations. When I offered advice, it was often contemptuously rejected.

Although I was his senior air force officer and Chiang Kai-shek's air force chief of staff, I was never called to the war zone headquarters to present my views on our air situation until after General Wedemeyer replaced Stilwell in 1944.

I do not feel ashamed that I often disagreed with Stilwell on policy, but I always faithfully executed every order he gave me. I do not argue that I was always right and Stilwell was always wrong. Under my guidance, mistakes were indeed made, but I believe that most of these mistakes were procedural rather than judgmental.

Our disagreements never reached the point of a public break, which is a success in that we both knew our limits. As later events proved, Stilwell's failure was entirely due to his relationship with the Chinese and his incorrect strategic choices in dealing with the war against Japan.

Long before he was recalled, General Stilwell had forbidden me to hold press conferences, even though I was the commander of the Fourteenth Air Force, whose headquarters was located in Kunming. The Chongqing War Zone Headquarters believed that only the war zone commander could meet with journalists at press conferences, although in fact, for most of the war, the Fourteenth Air Force was the only US combat unit in China and was therefore of great interest to the American public. The war zone headquarters' regulations and the field correspondent's insistence to the contrary forced me to adopt a ridiculous compromise, which was a "collective interview with journalists" instead of a press conference. The only difference was that the correspondent did not say "press conference" but "meeting" in the news he released. This slight difference seemed to satisfy everyone involved, including the war zone commander.

In 1945, as my mission as air force commander was coming to an end, it became very clear that even though Stilwell had been gone from China for a year, his judgment still carried weight in Washington, to my disadvantage. During my tenure as commander, I was always the target of malicious rumors and gossip spread by irresponsible officials. I am afraid that senior officials must have believed it and did not consider the truth.

In 1945, I was accused of failing to cooperate with General Stilwell, but it was the Fourteenth Air Force, which Stilwell sometimes considered dangerous and talked about, that completely ruined the US effort in China, as I will point out in these memoirs.

In 1945, before the air war in China had been won and far from confirming this achievement, a senior air force headquarters was established in Chongqing. Perhaps not on the surface, but in reality, I believe this action was directed at me.

I came to China in 1937 because I was invited to establish the Chinese Air Force. I stayed in China because I wanted to help China defeat Japan, which was four years before the Pearl Harbor incident.

After the Pearl Harbor incident, I re-enlisted in the US Army because I believed there was greater work to be done.

In July 1945, my usefulness to the United States and China in the war was over, so I retired from the US Army again. I retired with some disappointment, but I remained firmly convinced that Stilwell was an excellent field commander—one of the best division commanders the United States has ever produced.

### Unhappy Exit of Reynal: Quietly Flies Back, Adventure Plane Impounded, Our Government Will Officially Protest to the US Ambassador

[Reported by this Newspaper] After Reynal announced the abandonment of his exploration plan, Zhu Jiaju, Director of the Academia Sinica, and Sa Bentong, Director of the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica, telegraphed the Shanghai Civil Aviation Administration office yesterday morning to impound his exploration plane. Unexpectedly, Reynal, along with his pilot Auden, co-pilot Lee, and radio operator Lear, after arriving in Shanghai from Ping by the damaged exploration plane the day before yesterday afternoon, quietly got up from the Lizhi Society guest house where they were staying at 3:00 am yesterday morning, drove to Longhua Airport, and took off from Shanghai at around 6:00 am. By the time the Civil Aviation Administration discovered this, it was too late to stop them, and they were instructed to return to Shanghai by radio, but the plane ignored it and flew directly to Calcutta, India. The Civil Aviation Administration immediately telegraphed the "escape" of the plane to Nanjing. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 pm last night, the "Exploration" plane suddenly flew back to Longhua Airport. The reason for this is said to be that it had not contacted the Indian side in advance, so the Calcutta Airport did not allow it to land, and it had no choice but to fly back to Shanghai. The Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration was very surprised to see the plane fly back and immediately impounded it. As for Reynal himself, after this "dishonorable" futile round trip, he did not stay at the Lizhi Society guest house last night, but stayed at the Cathay Hotel. He claimed that he would go to Beijing this morning to explain to the authorities. It is reported that Reynal's exploration plan started in mid-January this year. He came to China twice and traveled between Beijing and Shanghai, formally establishing the exploration team under the contact with our government authorities and the Academia Sinica, with scientists from both China and the United States participating. On the 7th of last month, his self-funded exploration plane came to China from the United States. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, the fuel tank leaked oil and flew back to the United States for repairs. On the 26th of last month, the plane came to China for the second time and arrived in Shanghai. Everyone thought that the exploration work would be able to proceed smoothly, and Chinese and American scientists went to Lanzhou to wait first. Unexpectedly, the plane took off from Shanghai on the 28th, and the original route was from Hankou to Lanzhou, but it temporarily claimed that it was raining in Hankou, and without the consent of our Civil Aviation Administration, it changed its route and flew to Beiping. When it took off from Ping on the 31st, the right wheel suddenly tilted, causing a propeller to be damaged. Reynal immediately expressed discouragement and announced the cancellation of the exploration. After the damaged plane was repaired, it flew to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon, without contacting our Civil Aviation Administration in advance. After arriving in Shanghai, the Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration instructed Reynal to complete the formalities and asked how long he would stay in Shanghai. Reynal said that it would take at least two or three days to repair it. Unexpectedly, he quietly flew away before dawn yesterday, and finally had to fly back late at night. After repeated setbacks and delays, this Jishi Mountain exploration plan, which attracted the attention of the whole country and even the world, was officially called off in an unhappy state.

The content of the telegram sent by Zhu Jiahua and Sa Bentong yesterday morning stated: "Shanghai Civil Aviation Administration, please notify Longhua Airport that Reynal's plane must not leave China before completing the completion procedures." Now that the plane has returned, Reynal must have a headache to complete the completion procedures and cannot "just walk away." As for the Chinese and American scientists, Kosvi and Ross, who had already gone to Lanzhou, flew to Beijing and Shanghai to return to the United States yesterday, and the rest will also pack up and return, and the mysterious Animaqing Mountain will still be a mystery to the world.

[Another Report] According to the Associated Press Nanjing news, Sa Bentong issued a written statement accusing Reynal of violating the Sino-US agreement on the Jishi Mountain exploration. The government authorities will also formally protest to US Ambassador Stuart Leighton.

"Come to Chicago to Collect Unsettled Accounts in China"

The reporter visited Reynal at the Cathay Hotel late last night to inquire about his motive for leaving Shanghai in a hurry. Reynal said: "It is rumored that the Chinese government impounded my plane because my accounts in China were not settled, but I have had a lot of money dealings all over the world in the past, and if there are any unsettled accounts, they will be sent to Chicago to be handled. If there are any unsettled accounts in China this time, they can also be sent to Chicago to be collected." He also said: "Flying to Calcutta today was not because the airport there did not allow landing, but because I thought of the passport not being completed on the way, so I still flew back to Shanghai."

### Spot Checks on Speculative Firms, Several Found to Have Concrete Evidence, Three Secret Radio Stations Cracked

[Reported by this Newspaper] Since the 1st, the city's financial control agencies have sent personnel to conduct spot checks on several firms and shops suspected of speculation and operating in the black market for Hong Kong dollars and gold. As of yesterday, concrete evidence has been found for Xinghua Company in Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, Chengchang Company in Sichuan Road, Longxing Iron Company in No. 47 Lane, Chengdu Road, Yinghe Company in No. 12, Lane 301, Weihai Road, and several commercial banks. In addition, three secret radio stations have been cracked. Investigations are currently being expanded and will be announced after a period of time.

### Plotting to Purchase Gold Bars, Five Suspects Detained, Involving an Employee of the Bank of China

[Reported by this Newspaper] The police station's Economic Police Brigade yesterday received a report and seized a black market gold case at No. 38, Lane 404, Haining Road, and detained five suspects, Zheng Zuoyi, Huang Zezhen, Wu Xuecheng, and Li Zhenwu. During the investigation of this case, because the suspects were extremely cunning, the police station had to work hard and sent personnel to dress up and make contact several times in advance. Zheng Zuoyi, the person in charge of the place, initially refused sternly. Only after explaining that he was introduced by someone did he agree to talk. However, Zheng requested that all transactions be in cash. The police officer originally planned to purchase four large bars, but Zheng only promised one bar, with a price of 285 million legal tender, and still insisted on paying in cash. The police officer had no choice but to return to ask for instructions. After the police station borrowed cash from the Financial Administration, he took the money back to the place again. However, Zheng suddenly said that he was out of stock. After repeated consultations, Zheng notified Huang Zezhen, an employee of the Financial Investigation Office of the Bank of China, by telephone, and then Huang introduced him to Jiang's Xie Kang Money Shop at No. 88 Nanjing East Road to pick up the goods, and Zheng accompanied the police officer with cash to the shop. After the shop employee checked that it was correct, he only issued a receipt for 285 million legal tender, and then claimed that he had no goods. The police officers saw that they were repeatedly shirking responsibility and were afraid of other problems. They showed their identity and searched the shop, but found nothing. Jiang took the opportunity to escape. In addition to the fact that the borrowed money was not lost, only the above-mentioned suspects were taken to the police station for questioning.

### Customs Strengthens Efforts to Combat Smuggling; Confiscation Accompanied by Penalties

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the recently promulgated regulations for punishing smuggling, the Jianghai Customs has strengthened its anti-smuggling work starting from the first day of this month. In addition to the existing anti-smuggling personnel, customs police have been stationed at various port and airport terminals starting today to assist in the execution of duties. The customs has also posted notices in prominent positions at various port and airport terminals, stating that any false declaration, clandestine transportation, concealed carrying, impersonation, concealment, or secret unloading will be regarded as smuggling. In addition to the confiscation of smuggled goods, the offender will be sent to court for investigation and prosecution. According to the person in charge of the Jianghai Customs' anti-smuggling efforts, previously, ordinary smuggling cases did not involve judicial proceedings; according to customs regulations, only the smuggled goods were confiscated, and there were no provisions for imprisonment for smugglers. Now that the Legislative Yuan has passed the regulations for punishing smuggling, there are provisions for punishing smugglers. In the future, when the customs discovers smuggling cases, in addition to the confiscation of the smuggled goods, the smuggling offender will be transferred to the local court for trial according to judicial procedures. If passengers mistakenly bring a small amount of contraband due to unfamiliarity with customs regulations, the customs will deal with the goods but does not intend to transfer them to the court, as such cases are common and numerous, and it is practically impossible to subject them to judicial review one by one. However, it is difficult to distinguish the standard for what constitutes smuggling and what does not. If there are no clear regulations, abuses will inevitably arise in the future. The customs authorities are currently considering this issue in detail.

### Comical Lawsuit is Incoherent; Most Glorious Title is "Bailiff;" Request to Confirm Zhang Zhongyuan has Mental Illness

[Report from Our Newspaper] A certain Gao Jingqing often sends lawsuits to the court, but their contents are mostly incomprehensible. For example, in June of last year, he filed a lawsuit with the High Court's Civil Division accusing Shen Junru of "obstructing civic duties," which was completely nonsensical. Yesterday, he filed another lawsuit with the District Court's Civil Division against City Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan, requesting confirmation that the defendant is in a state of mental illness. The District Court refused to accept it on the grounds that the lawsuit was incoherent. The reporter requested to read the lawsuit, which was comical and bizarre. It began with a lengthy description of his experiences, with his most glorious title being "Bailiff of the First Special District Court," and now "my wife is a peddler, sorry, sorry." The object of the lawsuit: "(1) The defendant, the Chinese Furniture Industry Guild, should submit to the Shanghai Education Bureau for identification as to whether he had a mental illness before December 31, 1947, and within six months from the date of the judgment, he should be ordered to provide a diagnosis report. (2) The defendant Zhang Zhongyuan should submit to the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society's First Hospital Department of Psychiatry for identification as to whether he had a mental illness before December 31, 1947, and within six months from the date of the judgment, he should be ordered to provide a diagnosis report. (3) All litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant." Etc. The District Court refused to accept it, and Gao was still resentful.

### To Boost Morale; Raise Shoes for the Troops; This City Must Raise Two Million Pairs

### Six Times the Estimated Profit Tax; Various Trade Associations Request Reduction Again

This year's profit tax for profit-seeking enterprises, as stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, is estimated at six times the amount of profit tax from the previous year. The Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce had previously represented 126 trade associations in this city, and asked the central government to withdraw the order, but it was not adopted. Recently, after the Direct Taxation Bureau issued estimated payment notices in accordance with the above tax amount, 111 trade associations in this city, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, knitting, and inland river shipping, jointly submitted a letter to the Municipal Council again yesterday, listing reasons and requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, to consider the difficulties of the business, to allow for flexible collection methods. The four opinions originally submitted were: (1) Reduce the estimated payment multiple, (2) Postpone the payment period, (3) Exempt from further auditing after occupying and paying, (4) Those who have experienced significant differences in business prosperity or decline for two years, or whose tax burden is too heavy to pay, are allowed to apply for auditing immediately, and the decision on payment or exemption will be made after auditing. As for the reasons for requesting a reduction listed in the original letter, the most important is that according to the new Income Tax Law that has been amended and passed by the Legislative Yuan, its provisions on the starting point and tax rate have not reached six times the number of the previous year, and industrial and commercial profits and losses vary from year to year. Last year, due to rising prices, purchasing power decreased, while wage expenses increased sharply, and profits should not be compared with prices in general.

### Local Basic Education Symposium Convened Yesterday by the Ministry of Education Discussing Principles for the Distribution of Subsidies

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 2nd] The Ministry of Education convened a local basic education symposium at 3:00 PM on the 2nd.

Each attending representative discussed the "Principles for the Distribution of Subsidies for Local Basic Education" proposed by the Ministry of Education, item by item, offering opinions for reference. The key points of the principles set by the Ministry of Education are as follows: (1) The principle is to concentrate the use of this funding to maximize effectiveness. (2) Distribution Principles: (A) 77% will be used to universally subsidize each province and city, totaling 616 billion, emphasizing both quality and quantity, and paying attention to the development of national education in remote and impoverished areas. (B) 20% will be used for the expenses of demonstration areas for universal and basic education, totaling 160 billion, designating the capital and Beiping as basic education demonstration areas, to complete universal education within two years, half of the funding for universal education will be raised locally. (C) 3% will be used for experimental research and compilation of teaching materials, totaling 24 billion. (3) Each province and city should follow the principles of allocated universal basic education plans to spend funds: (A) 73% for basic education; (B) 17% for supplementary education; (C) 10% for teacher training. (4) Each province and city should concentrate on central national schools for the use of this subsidy in basic education, with two-thirds used to enrich equipment such as books and teaching aids, and the remainder for qualified teacher grants (urban schools emphasize expansion, rural schools emphasize quality improvement). Half of the subsidy for books and equipment will be allocated within the funds subsidized to each province and city. The ministry will form a procurement committee based on the needs of each region to uniformly manage distribution. In supplementary education, it should be concentrated in the larger cities of each province. (5) Each province and city should raise sufficient funds to match the central government's subsidy funds for joint subsidies, at least 20% of provincial education expenses and 70% of county and city basic education expenses must be allocated, otherwise, the central government will reduce the subsidy amount. (6) The subsidy fees that each province's pacification area should receive should be allocated proportionally, and no additional allocation will be made in the future. If it is temporarily impossible to use, it should be reserved or purchase supplies for future use. (7) Each province and city should publicly allocate and announce the amount distributed to each county, city, and district, as well as the dates of income and expenditure, and the ministry will send personnel to audit at any time. (8) For each province and city in the Northeast, in addition to purchasing supplies for future use in bandit areas, the regions where teaching is possible will still be issued subsidies according to the allocation principles.

### Open Badminton Tournament Concludes Li Guofan Wins Singles Championship 2-1 Thrilling Victory Over Hong Dequan

The last two matches of the Open Badminton Tournament were held at the Gymnasium starting at 6:30 PM yesterday. As a result, the Pan-Qu group defeated the Wei-Xin group in straight sets to win the women's doubles championship. Li Guofan reversed the defeat and defeated Hong Dequan to win the men's advanced singles championship. In the men's advanced singles final, the two sides were evenly matched. Hong Dequan relied on his agile figure and quick moves, frequently using smashes. Li Guofan was not his usual self when he first took the court, resulting in being at a disadvantage throughout the first game. In the second game, Hong Dequan still led, once occupying an absolute advantage with a score of 2-11. At this time, Hong could have defeated his strong opponent in one go, but unexpectedly he declined and was overtaken by Li, who took back one game, making it a tie. In the third game, Li Guofan went smoothly, while Hong Dequan was in a difficult state and could not recover. With a score of 1-2, Li Guofan won the championship of this group. The Open Badminton Tournament has now completely concluded.

### Telecommunications Q&A Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

[Fuyou Road Dacheng Clothing Store asks] Our keyboard is often damaged, causing dialing errors. After your bureau sent someone to check, they said there was no problem. Why?

[Answer] The cable of an automatic telephone depends entirely on the rotation of the dial. Therefore, the speed at which the dial returns is closely related to the mechanical action. Users often help the dial to return by hand after dialing, so the key action cannot be accurate and problems occur. We hope that when you dial, use your right index finger to press the dial into the finger hole according to the desired number to the copper hook, and then remove your finger, allowing it to return on its own. Never speed up or slow down the return, so as to avoid damage to the keys or incorrect wiring.

[Mr. Gu Decheng of Linsen Middle Road asks] I went to Sinan Road to send a telegram, but because it was past 5 o'clock, I needed to send it to the main business office, which was very inconvenient. It is said that international telegrams are still accepted as usual there between 5 o'clock and 6:30, but I don't know why?

[Answer] The Sinan Road branch is a mixed office of our bureau and the international radio station. In view of the fact that there are fewer domestic telegrams sent there, the business hours are temporarily set to 5 PM. We have now ordered the branch to be lengthened to 6:30 starting from the 18th of this month, which is the same as the business hours of the international radio station, in order to facilitate the public.

Literature and History

### The Ten Circuit Inspectors During the Reign of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang

— Tang Lan

The Tang History, Chronicle of Zhongzong, in the second year of Shenlong, has:

"In the second month, Yiwei, Minister of the Ministry of Justice, Wei Juyuan, along with the Zhongshu Menxia, became a three-rank official. Ten envoys were sent to inspect customs."

This record is slightly different in the New Tang History, Chronicle of Zhongzong. Yue Cheng "Bingshen, envoys were sent to inspect customs." The Treatise on Documents, volume 61, under the heading of "Inspectors, Investigators, Governors, and Other Envoys," states:

"In the second year of Shenlong, an edict was issued for twenty officials of the left and right wings and of the inner and outer fifth rank or above, who were knowledgeable and clear, and who would not yield, to be divided into ten circuit inspectors, rotating every two years, to honestly inspect the prefectures and counties."

This is somewhat more detailed.

The system of circuit inspectors during the Tang Dynasty probably originated in the eighth year of Zhenguan during the reign of Emperor Taizong. The Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance, volume 194, states:

"The Emperor wanted to send senior officials as grand examiners to the circuits, but had not found the right people. Li Jing recommended Wei Zheng. The Emperor said: 'Zheng warns me of my faults, and cannot be separated from my side for a single day.' Therefore, he ordered Jing, along with Xiao Yu, the Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, and others, a total of thirteen people, to travel throughout the land, observe whether the chief clerks were virtuous or not, inquire about the people's hardships, show courtesy to the elderly, provide relief to the poor, commend the good, and promote those who were delayed, so that wherever the envoys went, it would be as if the Emperor had witnessed it himself."

The Old Tang History, Chronicle of Taizong, and Chronicle of Gaozu, mention these thirteen people, only saying that they "were sent to the four directions to observe the customs." The Treatise on Documents, volume 61, under the heading of "Examiners," states: "In the eighth year of Zhenguan, eighteen circuit grand examiners were dispatched." But this event says "eighteen circuits," which is probably a mistake. Examiners were actually circuit inspectors, which the Tang people often confused. However, at that time there were only ten circuits, so it was also simply called the "Ten Circuit Envoys," as in the New Tang History, Biography of Su Wei, "requesting the dismissal of the Ten Circuit Envoys," while thirteen people were sent in the eighth year of Zhenguan, and it is not known how they were distributed.

The Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance, volume 208, states regarding the ten circuit inspectors during the Shenlong period:

"Twenty officials of the left and right wings and of the inner and outer fifth rank or above were selected as ten circuit inspectors to examine officials and pacify the people, recommend the virtuous and rectify injustices, and rotate every two years, examining their merits and demerits to advance or retreat them. Jiang Shidu of Weiren, the prefect of Yizhou, Ma Huaisu, a staff member of the Ministry of Rites, Yuan Ganxu of Linzhang, an imperial censor, Lu Huaishen of Lingchang, an investigating censor, and Li Jie of Fuyang, a junior minister of the Court of Imperial Insignia, all participated." The Old Tang History, Biography of Ma Huaisu, states:

"He was repeatedly transferred to the position of staff member of the Ministry of Rites, and along with Yuan Ganxu, Lu Huaishen, Li Jie, and others, served as the ten circuit examiners."

Jiang Shidu is not mentioned. But even according to what the Comprehensive Mirror says, only five people are pointed out. Recently, while reading Tang history, I have also examined several other people, which are recorded below.

1. Jiang Shidu The New Tang History, Biography, states:

"He was also the inspector of the Hebei Circuit and the envoy in charge of military supplies for the branch."

The Biography of Xiao Song also states:

"Jiang Shidu, the examiner of Hebei, appointed him as a judge."

2. Ma Huaisu The New Tang History, Biography, states:

"He was transferred to the position of staff member of the Ministry of Rites, and as the envoy of the ten circuits, he examined Jiangxi."

3. Yuan Ganxu The New Tang History, Biography, states:

"During the Shenlong period, as an imperial censor, he examined Jiangdong."

4. Lu Huaishen The New Tang History, Biography, only says that he "was promoted to imperial censor during the Shenlong period... and transferred to the position of censor of the Right Censorate." He may have served as an envoy in the capacity of a censor, but it is not known where he went.

5. Li Jie The New Tang History, Biography, states:

"During the Shenlong period, he was the examiner of the Hebei Circuit."

6. Ni Ruoshui The New Tang History, Biography, states:

"He was selected as a successful candidate in the imperial examination and repeatedly promoted to the position of supervisory censor of the Right Censorate, examining the Jiannan Circuit."

7. Lu Congyuan The New Tang History, Biography, states:

"He was transferred to the position of supervisory censor and served as the inspector and pacification envoy of the Shannan Circuit."

8. Hou Lingde The New Tang History, Biography of Li Shangyin, states:

"During the Shenlong period, Hou Lingde, the censor of the Left Censorate, served as the examiner of the Guannei Circuit. Shangyin assisted him, and because of his outstanding performance, he was promoted to supervisory censor of the Left Censorate."

9. Lu Jingqian The New Tang History, Biography of Li Suli, states:

"The examiner Lu Jingqian recommended him for his integrity."

The Old Tang History, Biography of Yin Sizhen, states:

"At the beginning of the Shenlong period, he was the Minister of the Court of Judicature... and was sent out to serve as the prefect of Qingzhou... Lu Jingqian, the inspector of Weizhou, arrived in the prefecture in August."

The Collection of Inscriptions on Metal and Stone, volume 68, "Wei Wen by Lu Gongqing," states:

"In the first year of Shenlong... he was changed to the magistrate of Rongyang County... Lu Jingqian, the inspector of the Henan Circuit and the chief clerk of Weizhou, reported his exceptional political skills."

Here are a total of nine people, and the places they went to include: Hebei, Jiangxi, Jiangdong, Hedong, Jiannan, Shannan, Guannei, and Henan, for a total of eight places. Only Lu Huaishen's destination is still unknown.

The original ten circuits at the beginning were:

1. Guannei, 2. Henan, 3. Hedong, 4. Hebei, 5. Shannan, 6. Longyou, 7. Huainan, 8. Jiangnan, 9. Jiannan, 10. Lingnan.

See the Geography Treatise. However, the circuit examiners during the Shenlong period also had Jiangdong and Jiangxi, which is very strange.

The Song Lian inscription on the Wurenxu Qieling Preface, reprinted by the Palace Museum last year, states:

"During the Longxing period of the Great Tang Dynasty, Lian asked about the counties, and there was a Ping Hou Sixian, the circuit examiner of the Jiangdong Circuit, who was from the Ding family of Yanguo, and whose canopy covered the capital."

When I wrote the postscript, because there was no Jiangdong Circuit during the Tang Dynasty, I said that "East is a mistake for South," and because the Xiang postscript was written as "Jiangdong South Circuit," I suspected that it was a "mistake for Jiangnan East Circuit." Now I know that not only was there Jiangdong, but there was also Jiangxi, which shows that one should not easily make judgments when reading ancient books without collecting all the evidence.

The "Ping" in "Ping Hou Sixian" is probably a surname. He was the circuit examiner of the Jiangdong Circuit, but according to the New Tang History quoted above, Yuan Ganxu examined Jiangdong. Then, there were at least two examiners in the Jiangdong Circuit. I suspect that the character "Da" (Great) in "Da Shi" (Grand Envoy) is somewhat related. According to the Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance and the Treatise on Documents, the envoys at that time had to be officials of the fifth rank or above, but Yuan Ganxu's official rank was only from the seventh rank, while Hou Lingde, the censor of the Left Censorate, who was the examiner of the Guannei Circuit, was acting in the capacity of a censor of the fourth rank. Therefore, Ping Sixian's rank may have been higher and he was a Grand Envoy, while Yuan Ganxu was his assistant, just as Li Shangyin was Hou Lingde's assistant. The New Tang History, Biography of Song Wuguang, states after the memorial to the Emperor on the great flood in the first year of Shenlong:

"Soon, he was sent as an imperial censor to inspect the Henan Circuit."

It can be seen that the Henan Circuit also had two people, Lu Jingqian and Song Wuguang. Then, in addition to the nine people mentioned above, three people, Ping Sixian, Li Shangyin, and Song Wuguang, can be added to the twenty people during the Shenlong period, so that twelve people can be examined.

The New Tang History, Biography of Xi Yu, states:

"Four times as an envoy, he traveled the Jiangnan, Jiangdong, Huainan, and Hebei Circuits." It seems that Jiangdong and Jiangnan are different. Then, although it was said to be "Ten Circuit Envoys" during the Shenlong period, Jiangdong, Jiangxi, and other circuits were actually separated, and were outside the ten circuits set during the Zhenguan period. I think this may have something to do with the thirteen envoys sent in the eighth year of Zhenguan, and I hope there will be other new evidence.

### Li Gou and Mencius

— Qi Xia

During the Northern Song Dynasty, scholars and officials in Jiangnan West Circuit, such as Ouyang Xiu, Li Gou, and Wang Anshi, all focused on the system of institutions and successively proposed some reform proposals for the politics of the time. These people were born in the same time and place, and their academic thoughts and political views were naturally easily influenced by each other. Mr. Hu Shi wrote an article on Li Gou's thoughts twenty years ago, in which he mentioned this matter, especially saying that many of the new laws implemented by Wang Anshi were extremely in line with Li Guan's propositions, so there must be a relationship of origin between them.

However, there were also differences in their thoughts and opinions. For example, Li and Wang's attitudes towards Mencius and Buddhism were very different.

Wang Anshi had quite a few exchanges with monks at that time. In his collection, there are still no less than thirty or forty poems dedicated to Master An, Baojue, and the monk Daosheng. He did not have a single text severely criticizing Buddhism, and in his later years, he lived in seclusion in Jinling, traveling in the mountains and rivers. Not only did he have more frequent exchanges with monks, but he also converted the garden house where he lived into a monastery, and donated a part of his private land to the Taiping Xingguo Temple in Jiangshan. In Li Gou's collection, however, articles criticizing Buddhism can be seen everywhere. He said that Buddhists "widely occupy fertile fields and profit houses, wear warm clothes and eat their fill, and talk emptily to deceive foolish believers." He also said that they "are not among the four classes of people," and that they "have no father and no ruler, combining the evils of Yang Zhu and Mozi," and should be strictly prohibited. This was very different from Wang Anshi.

Wang Anshi greatly admired Mencius. Many examples can be found simply from his poems. For example, in his poem in response to Ouyang Xiu, he said: "If I can glimpse Mencius in the future, how dare I hope for Han Yu in my whole life." He also wrote a poem with the title "Mencius": "Sunk souls and floating spirits cannot be summoned, but reading the remaining books makes one hope for his demeanor. Why be afraid that the world considers him eccentric, for there is such a person to comfort the lonely." However, Li Gou was a person known to all as "not liking Mencius."

Since the Northern Song Dynasty, many people have recorded Li Gou's "dislike of Mencius" in writing. Wang Cheng's "Dongdu Shilei" 114, Biography of Li Gou, states:

He never liked Mencius, thinking that Confucius respected the king, while Mencius taught the feudal lords to be kings. He once took the imperial examination, and could not get one of the six essays right, saying, "I have never not read the books, it must be the annotations and commentaries on Mencius." He threw down his pen and left, and people checked it for him, and it was indeed so. In the end, he did not pass the examination. Chao Gongwu's "Junzhai Dushu Zhi" also recorded this matter under Li's "Xu Jiang Ji," and the text was almost the same as in "Dongdu Shilei." The text says:

Gou was from Xujiang. He once took the imperial examination, and could not get one of the six essays right, saying, "I have never not read the books, it must be the annotations and commentaries on Mencius." He threw down his pen and left, and people checked it for him, and it was indeed so. Then he failed the examination and returned home. Chen Zhensun's "Zhaizhai Shulu Jieti" also records this matter:

Taibo did not like Mencius, and often spoke exclusively against him. He once took the examination for eminent talent and did not pass. It is said that in the cabinet examination, there were essay topics that he did not remember the source of at all, saying, "This must be an annotation on Mencius." He threw down his pen and left.

It is also recorded in Luo Dajing's "Helin Yulu":

Li Taibo wrote "Changyu" against Mencius. Later, he took the examination for eminent talent, and the essay topic was "When the classics are correct, the common people prosper." He did not know the source and said, "I have read all the books, this must be a saying in Mencius." He threw down his pen and left. In the "Daoshan Qinghua," whose author is unknown, there is an even more interesting story:

Li Gou, styled Taibo, was from Xujiang. He was virtuous and had literary talent, and many officials greatly respected him. He did not like Buddhism or Mencius; he liked to drink wine and write articles; his ancient prose was excellent. One day, a high official sent him several dou of wine, and Taibo's home-brewed wine was also ready. However, he was solitary and did not associate with people. A scholar knew that he must have wine, but had no way to get a drink, so he wrote several poems scolding Mencius, one of which said: "Whether the warehouse will be emptied or the stairs will be abandoned is not yet known, Mencius's talk about benevolence is also foolish; the father-in-law still wants to be the emperor, why did the son-in-law kill his younger brother?" Li was very happy to see the poem and kept him for several days. All they talked about was scolding Mencius. Before long, the wine ran out, and he left. Later, there was another person who sent wine, and the scholar heard about it and came again, writing three articles on righteousness, mostly criticizing Buddhism. Li read them and smiled, saying, "Your writing is very strange. But I was very lonely after you drank all the wine last time; I dare not keep you this time, I will keep this wine for my own comfort." Everyone who heard this burst into laughter.

Since the stories of Li's opposition to Mencius were so widely circulated, their truthfulness should be beyond doubt. From Li's own "Changyu," we can also see the intensity of his opposition to Mencius. There is a saying in "Changyu":

...How can it be said that "Confucius's teachings were not passed down"? That Mencius, who nominally studied Confucius but actually betrayed him, how could he have passed them down? May I ask what that means? Confucius's way is that the ruler is the ruler and the subject is the subject; Mencius's way is that everyone can be a ruler. When the world is without a king, those who are domineering speak falsely and debate endlessly without being killed, so that the philosophers can carry out their intentions. The wisdom of Sun Wu, the deceit of Su Qin and Zhang Yi, and the benevolence and righteousness of Mencius have different origins, but they are the same in that they disrupt the world. There is also a saying:

Mencius said: "The Five Hegemons are the sinners of the Three Kings." I think Mencius is the sinner of the Five Hegemons. The Five Hegemons led the feudal lords to serve the Zhou Dynasty. Anyone with humanity must know what is right and wrong. Mencius lived during the reign of King Xian of Zhou, and after another hundred years, the Qin annexed the Zhou. Alas! He was so cruel that he regarded the Zhou royal family as if it did not exist. There are also many words of disparagement of Mencius scattered throughout other articles, for example:

"Mencius considers himself benevolent, but I know that he is extremely unbenevolent."

"Believing in Mencius and not believing in the classics is like believing in others and not believing in one's parents."

"I think the world can do without Mencius, but it cannot do without the Six Classics."

He criticized Mencius's theories and his character so much that, as Yu Yunwen said in the preface to "Zun Meng Bian," "He criticized him to the core."

The words in Li's "Changyu" quoted above are not found in the currently circulating collection of Li's writings. I quoted them from "Zun Meng Bian." The reason why these passages are not found in the current edition of Li's collection is that the compilers of the Siku Quanshu in the Qing Dynasty thought that they had been deleted by those who edited this collection in later generations. The summary of the Xujiang Ji in the general catalog of the Siku Quanshu states:

According to Li Gou's chronology: In the third year of Qingli (Guiwei, 1043), he compiled the twelve-volume "Tuiju Leigao," and in the fourth year of Huangyou (Gengchen, 1052), he compiled the eight-volume "Huangyou Xugao." This collection was compiled by Zuo Zan of Nancheng in the Ming Dynasty, and contains thirty-seven volumes of poetry, prose, and miscellaneous writings, with a chronology of one volume at the beginning, and an outer collection of three volumes containing imperial edicts and recommendation chapters. It is probably not the old version of that time. People in the Song Dynasty often said that Gou did not like Mencius. Yu Yunwen's "Zun Meng Bian" contains seventeen articles from Gou's "Changyu," but this collection only contains three articles about Confucius's disciples disregarding the affairs of Duke Huan and Duke Wen, and Yi Yin deposing Taijia and the Duke of Zhou enfeoffing Lu. It is said that Zan concealed and deleted them. The preface to "Tuiju Leigao" by Zu Wuzhe at the beginning of the collection specifically compares Mencius to Gou; and the letter to Li Guan in the collection says: "The theories of Mencius, Xun Kuang, and Yang Xiong cannot be lightly assessed"; other articles in the collection also quote Mencius quite a bit, which is contrary to the various records of people in the Song Dynasty. Judging from the deleted "Changyu," could it be that Zan has tampered with it?

### The Year Yang Guifei Became a Daoist

— Chen Yuan

The "Tang Da Zhaoling Ji" forty has three documents regarding Yang Guifei:

1.  The text for conferring Yang Xuan's daughter as the Consort of Prince Shou. The twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month of Yihai in the twenty-third year of Kaiyuan.

2.  The text for conferring Wei Zhaoxun's daughter as the Consort of Prince Shou. The twenty-sixth day of the seventh month of Yixi in the fourth year of Tianbao.

3.  The edict for ordaining Prince Shou's Consort Yang as a female Daoist. The month and day at the bottom should be the second day of the first month of the twenty-ninth year of Kaiyuan.

Zhu Zhuti's "Shushi Ji" fifty-five has "After reading the Biography of Yang Taizhen," saying that the Consort entered the palace as a virgin. His explanation of the text conferring the Consort in the twenty-third year of Kaiyuan, according to the "Kaiyuan Li," is that when a Prince marries a consort, it involves accepting betrothal gifts, asking for a name, accepting auspicious omens, accepting tributes, and requesting a date for the wedding. All of these require divination, and there is no ceremony of accepting betrothal gifts, being conferred, and immediately returning to the Prince Shou's residence.

Now, examining "Tongdian" 129 on the imperial body, the consorts of princes receive their rank after the request of a date and before the personal reception. The reception follows immediately after the reception and cannot be based on this to say that the Consort did not return to Prince Shou's residence.

His explanation of the edict for becoming a Daoist is based on the sentence "belonging to the anniversary of the Empress Dowager's death," saying that the Empress Dowager was Emperor Xuanzong's birth mother, Empress Zhaocheng, who received the imperial seal on the second day of the first month of Changshou year two. Empress Wu used the Jianzi month as the beginning of the year. According to "Ceifu Yuangui" twenty-three, the first year of Yongchu was only changed to the second day of the eleventh month as the anniversary. During the Kaiyuan period, they still followed the old custom, so the date of the Consort becoming a Daoist should be the second day of the first month. His saying is very precise.

However, to think it was in the first month of the twenty-fifth year of Kaiyuan is because Empress Wu Hui had not yet passed away at that time. Empress Wu Hui's death was on Bingwu in the twelfth month of the twenty-fifth year of Kaiyuan. The old Jiulu, the new Jilu, and Tongjian 214 are all the same. Ceifu Yuangui three says it was the seventh day of the twelfth month. The seventh day is Bingwu, and the first day of the month was Gengzi.

Old Tang Book 51, Biography of Empress Hui, and Old Tang Book 107, Biography of Prince Shou, also say it was the twenty-fifth year. Only Old Tang Book, Biography of Empress Yang, says it was the twenty-fourth year Empress Hui died, and New Tang Book, Biography of Empress Yang, followed it, and deleted the year of Empress Hui's death in the Biography of Empress Hui in order to unify them. But they did not know that the Benji still said it was the twenty-fifth year. This is because the biographies and benji were not written by the same person.

Zhu Zhuti based his argument on the Biography of Empress Yang and pushed Empress Yang's entry into Daoism to the twenty-fifth year of Kaiyuan, which is actually too early. And if she really had not returned to Prince Shou's residence, then how could the anniversary of the Empress Dowager's death relate to an unmarried consort? This cannot be defended.

Zhang Shizhai's "Yishu Waibian" three, Bingchen Zhaji, is contrary to Zhu Zhuti's saying, stating that in the twenty-third year of Kaiyuan, the Empress was appointed as Prince Shou's Consort. The Empress was only seventeen years old. In the fourth year of Tianbao, there was an imperial order for Prince Shou's Consort Yang to become a Daoist, so Empress Yang had been in Prince Shou's residence for ten years.

I do not know what Zhang Shizhai based his claim that it was the fourth year of Tianbao when the edict for becoming a Daoist had no month or year. It seems rather arbitrary. His idea is that becoming a Daoist and being appointed as a Noble Consort both happened in the same year. He does not know that becoming a Daoist and being appointed as a Noble Consort have different purposes. Before being appointed as a Noble Consort, she could enter the palace first, but before leaving Prince Shou's residence, she could not be taken into the palace. Becoming a Daoist was to formally sever her relationship with Prince Shou's residence. After Empress Hui's death in the twenty-fifth year, the Emperor urgently sought a person to his liking. Having found someone to his liking, how could he wait until the fourth year of Tianbao? Therefore, Zhang Shizhai's estimation of the year Yang Guifei became a Daoist is too late.

So in what year did Yang Guifei become a Daoist? It is recorded in the new Ji for the year of Kaiyuan twenty-eight, under the entry for the tenth month Jiazhi, that the Emperor visited the Hot Springs Palace and then wrote "made Prince Shou's consort, Yang, a Taoist nun, titled Taizhen." Comparing this with the old records, it is known that this entry was added by the new record, and Tongjian did not record it either. What is the basis for the new record? It is based on the "Biography of Taizhen."

The "Biography of Taizhen" says: In the eleventh month of the twenty-second year of Kaiyuan, she returned to Prince Shou's residence. In the tenth month of the twenty-eighth year, Emperor Xuanzong visited the Hot Springs Palace and ordered Gao Lishi to take Yang from Prince Shou's residence and ordained her as a female Daoist, titled Taizhen. Zhu Zhuti considers this to be hearsay and does not believe the saying that she had returned to Prince Shou's residence.

Le Shi saw in the Song Shi 306 that he lived in the early Northern Song Dynasty, and his words should have a basis. The eleventh month of the twenty-second year is an error in the current version of the outer biography, as the month and year of the imperial edict can prove. However, taking Yang from Prince Shou's residence and ordaining her as a female Daoist may not have happened at the same time. According to the edict for becoming a Daoist, it clearly states that she was ordained because of the anniversary of the Empress Dowager's death, so becoming a female Daoist should have been on the second day of the first month of the following year. Since the new Ji took the Outer Biography, it should have recorded the event in the first month of the twenty-ninth year, and not in the tenth month of the twenty-eighth year.

### The End of March Has Passed

— Ping Zhai

Today is April 1st, and I have carefully read this newspaper's local news, paying more attention than usual. Why? Because the April 1st newspaper publishes the events that occurred on March 31st, and I have a special interest in what happened on that particular day at the end of March in Shanghai.

Isn't the end of March the deadline for half of Shanghai's dance halls to close down?

However, there is no news about these dance halls closing down in the April 1st newspaper. I am not surprised; on the contrary, I would find it a great surprise if the dance halls really closed down as scheduled.

Several of the Shanghai city councilors are acquaintances whom I meet every day. Therefore, during the most recent city council meeting, I happened to turn on the radio to listen to the proceedings. I originally wanted to hear the speeches of the councilors I knew, but instead, I heard a discussion about the dance ban issue, specifically the speech of Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau. I don't remember many of the things he said that day, but a few sentences made a particularly deep impression on me, so I still remember them very clearly. From these sentences, I had already anticipated that the April 1st newspaper might not have any "lottery-winning dance halls closing" news. He said: "My attitude is: if the central government does not urge me to handle this matter by the deadline, I will definitely not execute it automatically." At that time, several of the councilors were quite agitated. Because the council had already resolved to oppose the dance ban, but the government ignored it, they proposed a new motion with very impolite wording. Director Wu advised them about this motion, saying: "Please don't provoke the central government too much..." To be fair, Director Wu's tone that day was a bit overly cautious, but it was indeed quite sincere, and his words did take the overall situation into consideration to some extent.

Perhaps the grandiose dance ban will just be ignored? The unfortunate ones are the doors, windows, teacups, tables, and chairs of the Social Affairs Bureau.

I never dance, but I never oppose others dancing either – and I absolutely and resolutely oppose the dance ban. I believe that since the dance industry is a legal business, then the government's dance ban is wrong. Secondly, I believe that the savings achieved from the dance ban are not significant, while the resulting unemployment problem is very serious. The incident of dance industry workers smashing the Social Affairs Bureau may have been caused by a few ambitious individuals attempting to create a "tragedy," but it was the officials who suddenly had the strange idea of banning dancing who sowed the seeds of instability in Shanghai, giving these ambitious individuals something to exploit!

I also admire those who are simply headstrong to the end, because at least they mean what they say, and their orders are carried out, which demonstrates efficiency and prestige. However, in a democratic country, the public opinion of the people cannot be completely ignored. We individuals should pay attention to "being able to pick up and put down" and to "not hesitating to correct mistakes" in our dealings with the world, and the government should do the same. Even Roosevelt often encountered opposition from Congress during wartime, and if public opinion did not want him to do something, he could only accept it. Since our officials seem to lack the courage to urge the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to implement the dance ban – then why not simply abolish the dance ban altogether and at least earn the reputation of respecting public opinion?

First, they repeatedly issued orders to ban dancing, completely ignoring the representations of the public opinion organs. Then, when something happened, they didn't dare to be truly stubborn to the end. However, they were too embarrassed to publicly admit that they had been a bit frivolous, so after racking their brains, they finally came up with a policy of "opening one eye and closing the other," and the local government responded with "playing dumb." After admiring this, we common people feel both angry and amused!

### Jiangsu Has Abundant Water

— Hong Xian

The name of Jiangsu Province contains the character "Jiang" (江), meaning river. There are many rivers and lakes in the province, and its border faces the sea to the east. The names of the counties in the province are mostly derived from water. These can be classified into four categories:

(1) Counties named directly or indirectly after the sea: Donghai, Haimen, Haian, Shanghai.

(2) Counties named directly or indirectly after rivers: Songjiang, Wujiang, Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Jiangning, Jiangpu, Huaiyin, Huaian, Jingjiang, Lishui, Liyang, Jiangdu, Lianshui, Siyang, Shuyang.

(3) Counties named directly or indirectly after lakes: Baoying, Gaoyou.

(4) Other counties with water-related names: Peixian, Guanyun, Yancheng, Yangzhou, Gaochun, Qingpu, Nanhui, Chuansha.

The above four categories comprise twenty-nine counties, which account for almost half of the counties in Jiangsu.

### The Taste of Middle Age

— Shuang Lu

The ancients said: "Life is like a white colt glimpsed through a crack." But according to my personal experience, this may only apply to the stage from youth to old age. In youth, you just use your parent's money, feel there's more good times than you can live. In younger years, I was single, what I earned was enough for myself, even after marriage, still didn't have children, life was still passable, I still had some leeway to engage in flights of fancy. When a person has the leisure to dream, they will never feel life is difficult. But now as I reach middle age, I am forced to live practically and constantly preoccupied with the cost of living, without leeway to think, without leeway to avoid it, and without realizing it, the years go by.

Occasionally, I run into a classmate from middle school, we all have more wrinkles on our foreheads, our chins are jowly. If I encounter a few attractive young ladies, I might well think I can befriend them, yet they already think of me as belonging to the older generation, and call me uncle uncle, do I still have the courage to befriend them? My mood for excitement has diminished, I would rather quietly flip through old books. I can still see the child star Shirley Temple's movies right before my eyes, but the newspaper says that Shirley Temple not only is married, but already is a mother to a child. At those little moments, you will be astonished by the speed of time, and awaken to the fact that you have entered middle age. But the things of youth are still fresh in my mind, and when I think of the ancients' simile of "a white horse glimpsed through a crack", how can one not sigh ruefully!

People such as ourselves in our 30's, if we assume that "seventy years is rare from ancient times", it seems that we are already on the downward slope of our life journey, in our younger years we once had great ambitions, and had ambition, now we realize that we aren't cut from that cloth, and reality also makes it so you can't violate it, to ponder over it makes for the so called "tragedy of fate". Life is like exploration, enduring hardship is the support of future daydreams, now that we have a rough idea of the end of the journey, the exploration doesn't have much meaning, how many can give up and turn around?

Yet middle age has its benefits, too, books that we read formerly we often did not seek to understand to the greatest extent, or we were not able to really grasp them, now with an increase in knowledge, we are naturally able to solve the problems, or be able to recognize things more completely than in our youth. We can't help but say that it's a benefit of getting older.

Proficiency in human affairs is, mostly, a thing of middle age, until it reaches the right heat, it can't be pure and skilled. In our younger years, we easily trusted people, were easily moved to emotion, spoke with no room to turn around, and liked to criticize people, and in the end we reaped the losses for it, when I think about it, it's simply the work of an idiot. But what's gone is gone, going forward we won't repeat our mistakes, when I think of this, there's a lot of consolation, too.

When you get a little older, you see a little more, you hear a little more, you taste a little more personally, life is just watching people perform plays, and performing plays for people to watch, when you meet people and talk about plays, you're actually able to talk like a family, or have played every role, aren't those pleasures?

All this is a benefit of middle age, outside of sorrow there are also things to be happy about.

Westerners have a saying, "Life begins at forty", this statement is very true, to have good dreams is of course joyful, if you have bad dreams, at least you can understand a little taste of the dreams. If the dreams you had before forty were not very good, then why not start again at forty, and dream once more? If you can penetrate the logic of it, then life begins at forty is of course all right, but starting at fifty, sixty is also fine? If you can not have the worst ideas, and grasp some good states from reality, that is close to being an enlightened person, and close to being a god or immortal.

### Last Will

— Li Li

In the 19th century, Canadian Denlope made a will before his death:

—I bequeath five acres of land to my eldest sister, Joan, to comfort her for marrying a husband "dominated by Lanway."

—Give the small house on the edge of the land to my second sister, Sally. It seems that no one will marry her, and this small house is enough for her to use alone.

—Give my big Bible to my third sister, Katie. She can learn to be a good person from the words she knows.

—Give a large silver snuffbox to my brother James, so that he will know when he should get up.

—Give my best pipe to my brother-in-law Christopher, to show my gratitude to him for marrying my sister Meggie, who any man of taste would shake his head at.

### The Inspiration of Cars

— Yi Jun

I saw this sentence in an educational test book: "For four- or five-year-old children living in the city, the test question 'Who is faster, a car or a tram?' may be an effective intelligence test, but it is not suitable for children in the countryside." I, a 24- or 25-year-old adult in the city, cannot even answer this question, so my stupidity is evident. This happened the summer before last. But since then, I have often paid attention: Which is faster, a tram or a car?

After nearly two years of observation, I found that most of the time, cars always overtook trams like arrows. Only rarely did trams appear to be faster.

Therefore, I further studied the reasons. It turns out that trams have tracks (although trackless trams have no tracks under the wheels, they are still inseparable from the overhead wires, which is equivalent to having tracks). So when moving, if the road ahead is blocked by traffic, the tram itself is limited by the tracks and cannot freely overtake, so it has to drive slowly, and even stop. This is one reason. Even if there are few people and vehicles ahead and there are no obstacles, driving too fast risks derailment, so it cannot be fast. This is the second reason. Cars, on the other hand, are not limited by tracks, so they have plenty of freedom. If one place is blocked, they can go to another place, dashing around as they please, so naturally they are faster. However, trams may be slow, but there are fewer accidents. Cars may be fast, but there are more chances of accidents.

Therefore, I got an inspiration. The absence of freedom hinders one's own progress; unrestrained freedom easily infringes on the safety of others. The freedom we should strive for is full personal freedom that does not harm others. Only such freedom is worthy of saying: "Life is precious, love is more valuable; but for the sake of freedom, both can be abandoned."

### Terrible Adaptation

— Ye Gong

We humans are the best at adapting. First, let's talk about the eyes. When we first walk into a pitch-black movie theater from the bright daylight, our eyes are blinded and we can't see anything. After a while, our vision recovers and we can see our neighbors on either side, whether it is a man with a full beard or a beautiful young woman. The eyes have adapted to the darkness.

Next, let's talk about the ears. When we first move from the quiet countryside to a noisy city, we feel really irritated and uneasy, but after a few days, we become deaf to it and go about our business as if nothing had happened. The ears have adapted to the noise.

Third, let's talk about the nose. When we first enter a place that sells dried abalone, the fishy and stinky smell makes us nauseous, but strangely, we don't smell the stink after a while. The nose has adapted to the rotten smell.

Fourth, let's talk about the mouth. When we first tell a lie or say something base and vulgar, we blush and stammer, but after a few times, you will consider lying an art and scolding people a talent. The mouth has adapted to deception and curses.

Fifth, let's talk about the hands. When we first pick up a knife to kill someone, our hands will be soft and our courage will be weak. After killing too many people, it will be difficult to live without killing. The hands have adapted to the bloody cruelty.

Sixth, let's talk about the conscience. When we first have evil thoughts, we can't help but be cautious and feel lost. But ah, after a long time, the life philosophy of "I would rather betray the world than let the world betray me" is formed. The conscience has adapted to cruelty.

Ah, terrible adaptation!

### The Resistance of Air

— Ruzi

The German philosopher Kant once said: The difficulty that a pigeon flying in the air must overcome is the resistance of the air. The ignorant pigeon may think that if the air is removed, it will fly faster and more comfortably. Little does it know that if the air is really removed and the pigeon flies in a vacuum, the pigeon will immediately fall to the ground and be unable to fly. Air is the resistance to the pigeon's flight, but without the resistance of air, the pigeon cannot fly. From this, it can be seen that without suffering, without obstacles, without difficulties, great undertakings cannot be accomplished.

### The Magic in the Ordinary

— Leng Leng

The great French painter Claude Monet often set out at dawn, taking with him his lunchbox, painting tools, canvas, etc., to the countryside. He sat in front of a haystack—an utterly ordinary haystack in the middle of a field—and took out his painting tools to begin painting. He painted one picture after another from morning until it got dark, then packed up and went home. All twelve paintings made in a day were of the same haystack, but as time slipped by minute by minute, the sun shone on the haystack from different angles and with different intensities. The colors displayed were far more than twelve—truly ever-changing and infinitely beautiful, filling Monet with deep satisfaction.

### Recent Situation of a Prodigal Son

— Yongxiang

Mr. Xiang Kairan, known for his "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" and other novels, the prodigal son of Pingjiang—is now old, his hair half gray, but his body is still robust. He is usually silent and does not associate much with the world, but when he meets someone he is compatible with, he can talk endlessly without showing any signs of fatigue. He often writes letters and other ordinary social correspondence under the lamp with swift strokes. His calligraphy is elegant, and he can still write small characters, showing that his eyesight is not bad.

He had a deep friendship with Liao Lei, the former Chairman of Anhui Province. Liao recruited him and consulted him on important government affairs within the office. When he resided in the office building, many subordinates were in awe of him. In reality, he was not a harsh person, but he rarely smiled, and subordinates were afraid of running into trouble with him.

He had considerable courage. When the Japanese invaders occupied Hefei, he accompanied Chairman Liao from Lihuang to eastern Anhui for inspection. While passing through the Fenan intersection in southwestern Hefei, he accompanied Liao on the lecture platform to address the people. At that time, a pair of eagles suddenly appeared in the sky, coming from afar. Traitors suddenly shouted that enemy planes were attacking, and the crowd scattered in a panic, trampling on each other and causing injuries. Only he and Liao remained standing on the platform, unmoved. Last year, the Eighth Route Army harassed Lihuang, and Xiang was arrested. Ultimately, he was able to escape from danger with his eloquence, but he lost all his life savings in that incident. Although he is from Pingjiang, Hunan, he has bought a small plot of land in Liuan and plans to buy a house in the city to live there permanently. It turns out that he likes to drink tea and is very fond of the tea from Qitou Mountain in Liuan and the water from the Yi River, feeling reluctant to leave and enjoying the place so much that he forgets his hometown of Hunan.

In recent years, he has liked reciting Buddhist scriptures. He can recite the Diamond Sutra and the Great Compassion Mantra flawlessly. He likes vegetarian food, and prayer beads are always in his hand. He has taken refuge in a temple in western Anhui and become a Buddhist disciple. Xiangshan Temple in Lihuang was successfully renovated under his supervision. If it had not been destroyed by the bandits, he would have wanted to lead a group of monks to hold a seven-day Buddhist retreat and build a water and land dharma assembly to deliver suffering ghosts.

In his youth, he was also a strong contender in the game of love. He is the person who experienced and wrote "A History of Students in the East." Now, his wife is much younger than him, and they have children around their knees, the youngest being only six or seven years old.

### Beyond "Knee Room"

— Lei

A young couple went to see a very small apartment room while looking for housing. At a distance away from the landlord where their conversation couldn't be heard, the couple whispered to each other. The wife later nodded, so the husband turned back and said to the landlord, "Okay, I think we can rent it, although the room is a bit too small."

"I don't understand," said the landlord. "After all, this kind of apartment was designed and built for two people."

"Of course, that's right," said the young husband. "But you know, we hope to keep a goldfish as a pet in the room in addition to the two of us!"

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14: Carefree at Sea (116)

Zhu Zhai said, "My thinking was completely wrong before. Now I feel that our home is too good, and I can't bear to leave it." Feng Sheng said, "Don't say too much in front of me. If you really think this home is good, you wouldn't have divorced me." Zhu Zhai said, "The divorce that day was due to my temporary confusion. Now I understand completely. Please forgive me this time." Feng Sheng said, "I can forgive you, but I cannot forgive your heart. You were determined to divorce me that day because you must have had other plans in your heart. Now, the person you wanted to marry doesn't want you anymore, so you want to come back home again. Although I am a woman, I want to keep my word. I won't be fickle like you. We are already divorced, so we should follow the terms of the agreement." Zhu Zhai said, "You keep saying that you want to follow the agreement, but you should know that the divorce agreement we wrote was made privately between the two of us and is not legally valid. Furthermore, we did not announce our divorce to the outside world. Even our parents don't know about it. How can we use this piece of waste paper as a basis?" Feng Sheng said, "Then you deceived me. I can't agree to you even more." Zhu Zhai said, "There's no need to mention the past. Please forgive me and cancel the divorce certificate we made first, okay?" Feng Sheng said, "No, no. You want to trick me out of my written document, but that's impossible. Don't even think about it. The document is in my hand, and I can't give it to you no matter what." Saying that, she angrily turned around and wanted to go into the room. Zhu Zhai hurriedly said, "Feng Sheng, don't misunderstand. I didn't mean that. If you don't believe me, I have proof to show you." Saying that, he took out the letter from his pocket and handed it to Feng Sheng, saying, "You'll understand what I mean by looking at it. What is my intention for coming back this time." As soon as Feng Sheng saw that it was Yun Qing's letter, her face immediately showed a very astonished look and asked, "It's her letter." While saying that, she sat down in a chair with a thud and read Yun Qing's letter from beginning to end, then read it again. Then, staring at Zhu Zhai's face with wide eyes, she asked, "Do you mean you want to come back? I think you're better off outside." Zhu Zhai said anxiously, "Why don't you understand what I mean? I am sincere, repenting and correcting myself, asking for your forgiveness. You should know my temper. If I didn't believe Yun Qing's words, I wouldn't want to come back." Feng Sheng said, "Then you don't have to come back!"
