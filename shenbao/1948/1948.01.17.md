### Further Developments in the Kowloon Walled City Case: Diplomatic Authorities Express Deep Regret; Executive Yuan Orders Protection of British Consulates and Nationals Nationwide

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Foreign Minister Wang met with British Ambassador Sir Ralph Stevenson at 4 PM on the 16th to continue discussions from the 15th regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident. Simultaneously, reports were received of the British Consulate and Information Office in Guangzhou being attacked and burned by enraged crowds. The two officials also exchanged views on this matter, both acknowledging that the dispute arising from the Kowloon Walled City had become excessively large and expressing deep regret. To maintain the friendship between China and Britain, this issue must not be allowed to escalate further. The most important matter at present is to swiftly achieve a proper resolution to the case. However, no response from London to our repeated protests has been conveyed to our Foreign Ministry through Ambassador Stevenson. Some individuals believe that the British side bears greater responsibility for the unfortunate incident in Guangzhou, arguing that the Chinese government has exerted every effort to guide the high tide of protest and sentiment, and has repeatedly intensified negotiations with the British side, hoping to find a solution to the problem in the shortest possible time. However, the Hong Kong side acted unilaterally, and London failed to recognize the seriousness of the situation, repeatedly delaying, ultimately leading to this deeply regrettable incident.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] After receiving reports of the British Consulate-General and the Jardine Matheson & Co. in Shamian, Guangzhou, being attacked and burned, Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun convened relevant officials on the 16th and issued instructions, also sending telegrams to provincial and municipal governments, instructing as follows: All illegal acts of violence, regardless of any pretext or reason, should be severely punished according to law. Provincial and municipal officials should urge security agencies to effectively protect the lives and property of British consulates and their nationals in their respective jurisdictions. Failure to do so will result in the assignment of due responsibility. In addition, instructions were given to the Foreign Ministry to actively continue negotiations based on the government's established position and policy regarding the Kowloon incident, to quickly seek a proper solution.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Office, Dong Xian Guang, stated on the 16th that the government deeply regrets the unfortunate incident in Guangzhou on the 16th caused by the demonstration.

### Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters Issues Proclamation: Criminals Infiltrated Demonstration Ranks and Committed Violence; Determined to Investigate and Prosecute to Maintain Foreigners' Safety

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] After the unfortunate incident in Shamian, Guangzhou Mayor Ouyang Ju went to meet the British Consul-General to express his regret, and assured him that the security authorities would jointly protect the safety of British nationals' lives and property.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Director Song of the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters issued a proclamation tonight regarding the unfortunate incident during the demonstration parade: "Regarding the recent forced demolition of civilian residences in Kowloon Walled City, the central government has repeatedly declared that the Foreign Ministry will actively negotiate based on legal standing and the principle of safeguarding sovereignty, seeking a reasonable solution. Local governments and people, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, have engaged in rights protection movements, which should also await central government disposition and not exceed the bounds of the law. However, at noon today, residents of this city held a demonstration parade protesting the Kowloon Walled City incident. At 2 PM, a portion of the demonstrators broke away from the ranks and rushed into Shamian. Criminals seized the opportunity to infiltrate, burning the British Consulate-General and throwing bricks and stones, injuring foreigners and engaging in extremely hateful and lawless violence. Shamian has already been recovered and belongs to our national territory, and the lives and property of resident foreigners should naturally be equally protected. This act of violence is an extraordinary event. This Director, in order to maintain public order, is determined to investigate and prosecute severely. If such incidents occur again in the future, they will be stopped by force and will not be tolerated. Therefore, this proclamation is issued for all to obey."

[Another Dispatch] After the British Consulate in Shamian was destroyed by the mob, the authorities here expressed deep concern. Chairman Song Ziwen personally expressed condolences to the British Consul and stated that he would do his best to maintain the safety of British nationals. A full curfew has been imposed in Shamian.

### Accident Occurs During Demonstration Parade: British Consulate in Shamian Burned; Impacts Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, and Reuters

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 16th] Various sectors in Guangdong and Guangzhou held a demonstration parade on the morning of the 16th to protest the Kowloon Walled City incident. Over 20,000 people from various sectors gathered upon hearing the news. The demonstration route had originally been temporarily changed to avoid Shamian, to prevent unpleasant incidents. However, as the main column passed Taiping South Road, a group of students and workers first broke through the police blockade and rushed into Shamian. They first tore down the British flag hanging from the British Consulate with iron chains, and broke the flagpole, declaring revenge for the British's humiliation of our national flag in Kowloon Walled City.

Under the raging flames, the British Consulate and the adjacent British Information Office, Reuters Guangzhou Branch (having just started publishing five days ago), Jardine Matheson & Co., and Butterfield & Swire were instantly reduced to ashes. A portion of HSBC Bank was also affected. The fire was extinguished at 6 PM. The crowd surrounded Shamian, shouting "Down with British Imperialism" and "Recover Hong Kong and Kowloon." At that time, the British Consulate staff had fled one after another. Those who did not manage to leave were escorted away by our military police with strict protection, so no bloodshed occurred. The occurrence of the unfortunate incident in Shamian is generally believed to have been caused by a series of unfriendly actions by the British side.

The old hatred of the 'June 23rd' Shamian Massacre remains. We absolutely cannot allow such atrocities to be seen again today. We are always willing to sacrifice everything to defend Kowloon Walled City, recover Kowloon, and recover Hong Kong." Lu Jin, a representative of the Kowloon Walled City disaster victims, arrived in Guangzhou on the 14th and paid a visit to Chairman Song on the 15th to report the details of the tragedy.

### My Application for U.S. Loan Purposes: Divided into Two Parts, Construction and Currency Reform; Minister to Submit Long-Term Aid to China Plan

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th Dispatch] According to reliable sources: The loan utilization plan brought by Bei Zuyi from the United States is divided into two parts. The total amount of loans proposed to the United States this time is over 1.5 billion US dollars, up to around 2 billion US dollars. According to the plan, one part will be used for construction expenses, and the other part will be used as a fund for currency reform. The latter accounts for about one-third. Construction expenses include railway construction and the development of industry and mining. The currency reform will entail the recall of all legal tender currently in use, with several billion yuan allocated to a new currency fund. In the future, new currency will be issued, and legal tender will be withdrawn. The old legal tender will no longer circulate.

[Further Dispatch] The U.S. Department of State issued a formal statement tonight, expressing a warm welcome to the Chinese technical delegation to the United States led by Bei Zuyi. The delegation will arrive in Washington on the 16th. The State Department's statement said that it expects the Chinese technical delegation to assist the State Department and other government departments involved in the aid plan. The State Department is prepared to discuss China's economic situation and the policies currently adopted by the Chinese government with the delegation. The State Department stated that it recently received a notification from the Chinese government stating that China was preparing to send a small technical delegation to the United States to discuss matters related to aid. The State Department immediately responded, welcoming the delegation to the United States. [United Press, Cincinnati, 15th Dispatch] Lieutenant General Albert Wedemeyer, former U.S. presidential special envoy to China and current Chief of the Operations Plans Division of the British Army General Staff, stated on the 15th: "As long as the United Nations continues to be useful, war will not break out immediately." However, he pointed out that China is a dangerous location that could become a "springboard" for major conflict. His report on China is still kept secret by the Department of State, so he could not elaborate on this point during his interview with reporters here. He stated that the outcome of Chinese President Chiang's efforts to establish democracy depends on "foreign aid or foreign interference."

Editorial

### Action or Stagnation, Unity or Division?

The delegation of petitioners from the three Speakers of the Tianjin, Hebei, and Hebei Provincial Assemblies, along with representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association, a group of five, flew to Shanghai the day before yesterday. They first consulted with the President of the Central Bank and attended a banquet held by the Shanghai press yesterday afternoon, detailing the economic crisis in North China and urging reporters to pay attention. Last night, they boarded a train to Nanjing to earnestly petition the central authorities, hoping to convey the heavy voice of the people of the North to the ears of the central government. Due to the pressing expectations of their group, and the intermittent appeals of Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors over the past month, people can generally feel the increasing severity of the economic crisis, which cannot help but evoke a long-suppressed question in everyone's mind: Is the current government's economic policy one of action? Unity? Or division?

The ten examples listed by the Northern Petition Group and the seven measures they hope for, such as (1) encouraging exports, (2) opening up foreign exchange, (3) restoring production loans, (4) negotiating the purchase of American cotton and wheat, (5) increasing grain and cotton production, (6) implementing coal-for-grain exchanges, etc., are not only major issues related to the livelihood of the people in the North, but also major issues related to the national economy and the people's livelihood of the entire country. Whether these measures can be adopted, and whether the current artificial obstacles can be removed, is the key to whether the national economy can turn from danger to safety in the future. Therefore, we should not regard the success or failure of this petition to Nanjing by the Northern Petition Group as a local matter for the North, but as a matter concerning the overall pacification of the rebellion. We can almost say that this trip by the Northern Petition Group is a touchstone for whether the central government will consider adopting public opinion and changing its economic policies in the future. In essence, what we demand should be an "active" economic policy, not a "stagnant" economic policy; it should be a "unified" economic policy, not a "divided" economic policy. The former is the path to life for the national economy; the latter is the path to death for the national economy!

Stopping production loans, stopping industrial loans, stopping foreign exchange, stopping salt loans, restricting the transport of northern coal to the south, restricting the transport of southern grain to the north, stopping the reclamation of farmland in Hebei, reducing grain and cotton production—these examples listed by the Northern Petition Group all illustrate that the current policy is one of "stagnation" and "division." But what our country urgently needs is "mobilization," "total mobilization," "unity," and "great unity"; to want to mobilize but instead cause stagnation, to want unity but instead promote division, this is truly running in the opposite direction, and there is no stranger thing in the world.

We have long said that the Communists use every means to achieve their goal of destruction. Only by destroying the countryside and making it impossible for farmers to produce, obstructing the circulation of materials, and trapping the country in a state of division, can the Communists drive all the homeless, jobless, and displaced people to become tools for harming the country and destroying the nation. For the sake of saving the country and the people, we must mobilize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to suppress the bandits and quell the rebellion. We must prescribe the right medicine, and only by using construction to overcome destruction, by using production to overcome annihilation, by using unity to overcome division, and by using mobilization to overcome obstruction, can we unite all the patriotic people's strength to strike at this unprecedented national traitor in history. Therefore, the general key to resolving the current economic crisis lies only in starting from (1) increasing production, (2) circulating materials, (3) guaranteeing employment, and (4) stabilizing society. All government measures and methods that conform to these four major principles are the "active" and "unified" policies that the people hope for. Conversely, if those in charge of major plans have limited vision in economic policy, only focusing on small calculations, only focusing on local calculations, only focusing on temporary calculations, and do not understand how to mobilize and use the people's strength, thinking that they can resolve the economic crisis by using some means of "stopping" or "restricting" something, they will surely regret it too late!

We would like to take advantage of the opportunity of the Northern Petition Group's entry into Nanjing to offer a few superficial views to the senior officials in charge of economic policy, without fearing the criticism of being unpalatable: (1) Economic stability is a prerequisite for political stability; a political system on the right track is a prerequisite for military power. (2) If the Northeast is lost, there will be no North China; if North China is lost, there will be no Central China. (3) The economy is like the blood vessels of the human body, interconnected and flowing at all times, and a slight movement in one part affects the whole body. There is no reason to forcibly obstruct it with human power; once the blood vessels stagnate, they will inevitably wither. If the economy "cuts off flow" for a long time, it may lead to its own collapse. We must loudly proclaim that the current economic phenomenon is extremely imbalanced and extremely dangerous! The North and the South are imbalanced, the countryside and the cities are imbalanced, the common people and the wealthy are imbalanced! Accumulating the consequences of all kinds of imbalances, or allowing them to evolve, will lead to unimaginable consequences for the economic future! What is the way to salvage it? It is;

Change the "stagnant" economic policy to an "active" economic policy!

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th Dispatch] Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, attended the eighth meeting of the Price Committee of the National Economic Council at 9:00 am on the 16th, and gave a detailed report on the recent situation of cotton yarn and cloth. Yuan first stated that due to the rampant activities of the Communists, transportation has not been restored, supply and demand are imbalanced, and prices are soaring. The central government has therefore decided to implement controls on important materials to stabilize finance and meet the needs of quelling the rebellion. The recent measures for the management of cotton yarn and cloth are one of the important decisions. Yuan's report is divided into three parts.

The Upward Trend Over the Past Year

(1) The upward trend of cotton yarn and cloth prices over the past year: The rate of increase of the three (cotton, yarn, and cloth) is quite uneven. Taking January 1947 as the base period (100), by December, cotton was 2.011, cotton yarn was 1.300, and cotton cloth was 1134. The rate of increase in cotton was more than 20 times in one year, far higher than general prices, almost approaching the rate of increase in the black market for gold and banknotes. The particularly rapid increase in the price of cotton is due to (A) insufficient domestic cotton supply. It is estimated that the cotton production in 1947 was 1.073 million piculs, but the annual demand for cotton used for hand spinning and folk quilts is 4.5 million piculs. The annual cotton demand for the nation's yarn spindles is more than 10 million piculs, so the cotton supply is insufficient by 5.5 million to 6 million piculs; (B) transportation difficulties. Cotton production in war zones is difficult to transport due to traffic obstruction, so the cotton that could have been supplied to yarn mills must be discounted; (C) reduced imports of foreign cotton. In 1946, the total import of foreign cotton was 6.891 million piculs, including 1.264 million piculs from UNRRA and 5.627 million piculs from imports. In 1947, UNRRA imported 1.401 million piculs, but the import quota for foreign cotton was 80 million US dollars, which could import about 2 million piculs of foreign cotton, totaling 3.401 million piculs, less than half of the import volume in 1946; (D) purchases by all parties in the producing areas. When cotton was put on the market last year, all parties rushed to purchase in areas where transportation was relatively easy. The government did not manage it in advance, resulting in soaring cotton prices, which stimulated the rise in yarn and cloth prices.

Review of Past Regulatory Policies

(2) Review of past regulatory policies: In the past, the Textile Adjustment Committee only focused on cotton yarn and did not comprehensively control the three (cotton, yarn, and cloth), so it could not be effective; past regulatory policies were nothing more than two ends: (A) flexible price negotiation. Because market prices fluctuated too violently, price negotiation was difficult to do. If it was too low from the market price, production would not cover the cost. If it followed the market price, it would stimulate prices; (B) selling banknotes along with materials. This policy, because the government's materials are limited, cannot be sold in large quantities, only having a temporary effect and difficult to sustain. From November 28th last year to the 7th of this month, the amount of yarn sold reached 13.249 pieces, which is quite considerable, but not a fundamental solution.

Future Control Seeks to Be Reasonable

(3) Implementation of future control: The overall control of cotton yarn and cloth in the future lies in maintaining and supporting within the management. The implementation plan for each item seeks to be reasonable. This detailed implementation rule has been agreed upon and is being drafted. The main aim of the management is to appropriately coordinate the entire process of production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales, so that hoarders and speculators have no skills to use. Even if it rises again in the future, it can rise reasonably. From cotton farmers to textile factories, in addition to production costs, they still maintain their legitimate profits. The government manages and assists at the same time, allowing our national capital-accumulated textile industry to enter a prosperous development path. Future control methods are (A) unified purchase of cotton. Entrust the Textile Construction Company and organized cotton merchants to purchase on behalf of the government. The price will be determined by the Management Committee according to the local cost, quality, and transportation situation, and the standard price will be adjusted at any time; (B) processing on behalf of others. Stipulate the standard for converting cotton into yarn and yarn into cloth in kind. All yarn mills (over 3,000 spindles) and cloth mills (over 30 machines) that meet the regulations can process on behalf of others. The calculation standard for processing fees is quite flexible. All finished products are controlled by the Management Committee; (C) reasonable distribution of yarn and cloth. In the past, the quantity of yarn and cloth supply and demand could not be balanced, resulting in it becoming an object of speculation. In the future, the government will control all materials and distribute them reasonably. Most of the cotton yarn, in addition to being handed over to cloth mills for weaving on behalf of others, will be distributed to registered qualified replica factories and their trade associations. The distribution of yarn and cloth to yarn merchants, cloth merchants, and dyeing factories will adopt a bidding method. Users will report the price they are willing to pay and the quantity they are willing to purchase, and apply for distribution. The Management Committee will approve a reasonable price and distribute it separately, so that the supply and demand of yarn and cloth in the future can be appropriately adjusted, without the risk of disconnection.

Production and Distribution Carefully Considered

Yuan's conclusion stated: The Management Committee has comprehensively considered how to fully supply raw cotton, how to stabilize cotton prices, how to expand yarn and cloth production, and how to distribute reasonably. It is committed to the normal development of this national industry, the practical guarantee of the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the effective implementation of the central government's wartime economic measures. According to Yuan, the standard for converting cotton into yarn is 712.5 pounds of cotton for one piece of yarn, of which 453 pounds are given to cotton and the remaining 259 pounds are converted into legal currency for payment. The labor cost is calculated according to the index. The abstract tube standard for weaving cloth from yarn used to be 24 to 28 pieces of cloth for one piece of yarn, including the labor cost, which is still being implemented.

### I Allow Church Special Plane to Fly to Laohekou to Evacuate Missionaries; St. Paul Flies from Zhengzhou to Shanghai

[Our Dispatch] The Lutheran Church officially announced yesterday: The Chinese Air Force has now allowed the church's special plane, St. Paul, to land at the Laohekou military airport once to transport about 40 American and Norwegian missionaries from the area. Since three missionaries were killed by bandits in northern Hubei, the Lutheran Church has repeatedly negotiated with the Chinese Air Force authorities, hoping that St. Paul could go to Laohekou to undertake evacuation work. The military situation in the area is very tense, and fierce fighting is taking place 25 miles northeast of the city.

[Further Dispatch] The church's special plane, St. Paul, flew from Zhengzhou to Longhua Airport in this city on the evening of the 15th, carrying the wife of the director of the Southern Church Hospital, Ayers, and the missionary couple Harris. All three are members of the Baptist Church (an organization within Christianity). St. Paul flew back to Hankou yesterday morning. If there are no accidents, it will go to Zhengzhou again this morning to carry out the work of airlifting hospital equipment and medical personnel. According to Harris's statement to reporters: We have been away from our country for a long time and long for our hometown. We will take a boat back to the United States in the near future. From my observations, although the bandits are very rampant in the Zhengzhou-Kaifeng area, they do not have the strength to occupy the two cities. However, the Longhai Railway has been cut off for a long time, and the food and materials in the nearby counties have been looted by the bandits and must also supply the large army, resulting in a very serious economic situation, especially the food situation in Kaifeng.

[United Press, Washington, 16th Dispatch] The State Department announced last night: Due to the growing anti-foreign sentiment in areas threatened by the Chinese Communists, it has ordered American missionaries in the area to evacuate as soon as possible.

### Downsizing of Various Agencies: Executive Yuan Orders Subordinates to Draft Implementation Measures

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th Dispatch] The measures for downsizing central government agencies were passed by the Executive Yuan Council some time ago. The Executive Yuan has now issued orders to its subordinate agencies to comply and implement them, and the heads of each agency are immediately drafting implementation measures. According to the principles of downsizing, starting from February of this year, the number of employees will be reduced by 5% each month. After five months, it can be reduced to three-quarters of the number of employees before the month. The implementation measures drafted by each agency are to allocate the 5% of personnel that should be reduced each month. According to relevant sources: After the government decided to adjust the treatment of public employees, a huge amount of money will be added to the financial budget. The authorities, while stabilizing the living conditions of public employees, also take into account the country's financial budget, so there is a move to downsize. If the implementation measures can be realized as scheduled, the increased expenditure will not be too large.

### New Method for Paying Workers in Central Agencies: Divided into Two Parts, Technicians and Laborers

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th Dispatch] It is learned that the Executive Yuan has decided on a method for paying workers in central government agencies, which is roughly divided into two parts, technicians and laborers. The standard for technicians is a base salary of 20 yuan to 60 yuan, and the standard for laborers is a base salary of 6 yuan to 18 yuan. The method of gradually reducing living allowances each month in the Executive Yuan's approved measures for improving the treatment of public employees is to stipulate that agencies should downsize, and each agency will not increase expenses after deducting salaries. Those that are insufficient will be compensated by downsizing.

### Sharp Decline in Production and High Prices in the Northeast: Who is to Blame? People's Livelihood Declines Further Under Communist Interference

[United Press, Shenyang, 15th Dispatch] Repeated attacks by the Communists have reduced the farmland in the areas controlled by the Northeast National Army to 5% of the total area. The general industrial level has also fallen to a new low. The number of kilometers of railways open to traffic is very few. The production of electricity and coal has been greatly reduced, resulting in a shortage of various necessities. For the past two and a half months, imports and exports in the Northeast have virtually come to a complete standstill. The main imports used to be cotton, cloth, flour, cotton yarn, and cigarettes. Currently, American cigarettes sell for 160,000 yuan per pack. Even if the Communists stop attacking the Ping-Shen Railway, the repair work will take at least two months. Only the coal-producing areas of Fushun and Benxi still have railway connections with Shenyang. The workers in Fushun are not in good spirits because their income is not enough to have a full meal. Engineers in the area earn only the equivalent of 15 US dollars per month, and the income of workers is certainly even lower. The lack of electricity has greatly reduced the production of yarn mills. Only 25,000 spindles are operating in the areas controlled by the National Army. The lack of electricity and raw materials has caused paper, cement, and other smaller industries to cease operations. The price index in December last year, compared with ten years ago, was 22.222 times for food, 21.343 times for clothing, 4.167 times for rent, and 24.260 times for fuel. Currently, 55,000 yuan, 70,000 yuan for flour, and 100,000 yuan for sugar. 320,000 yuan per piece of local cloth, and 5.3 million yuan per ton of coal.

### Full Text of Draft Implementation Measures for the Financial Portion of the Economic Plan

(Continued from yesterday)

B. Control of Tax Sources

A. Direct Taxes: Zi. Vigorously implement a general survey of industry and commerce and registration of the business premises of independent professionals to facilitate control of taxpaying units. Chou. Offer the highest possible withholding reward to encourage timely withholding of taxes. Yin. Increase penalties; impose heavier penalties on taxpaying units that fail to declare or conceal their income and overdue taxes. Mao. Request judicial authorities to establish a special tax court or appoint dedicated judges to ensure swift and effective handling of tax cases.

B. Commodity Tax: Zi. Shorten the price assessment period. Under the current commodity tax regulations, the average market wholesale price over three months is used to determine the tax-inclusive price and tax amount. It is proposed to revise this to use the average wholesale price of the most recent month as the basis for determining the tax-inclusive price and tax amount, so that tax revenue can better reflect actual price fluctuations. Chou. Improve tax assessment methods: The current method requires price fluctuations of 25% before the tax amount can be adjusted. It is proposed to revise this to allow adjustments when price fluctuations reach 20%.

C. Customs Duties: Zi. Strengthen investigation and enforcement capabilities. Directly negotiate with the U.S. Navy to purchase sixteen minesweepers and one hundred and thirty various motorboats, which will be converted, equipped with weapons, and fitted with wireless telegraphs for use by various customs stations. Naval vessels will also be transferred, customs officers will be assigned to vessels to investigate and intercept smuggling by vehicles and people, and customs police will be rigorously trained, their numbers expanded, and dispatched to South China to perform their duties. Chou. Actively pursue negotiations. Request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue negotiating with the Hong Kong government on customs matters, to implement anti-smuggling measures within Hong Kong's territory, and request the Ministries of Finance and Communications to jointly draft measures for customs inspection of railway passengers and goods, to coordinate with anti-smuggling efforts. Yin. Investigate civilian inducement flights to prevent smuggling via air transport. Mao. Strictly establish penalty measures. It is proposed to submit a special anti-smuggling law to the Executive Yuan to severely punish smugglers.

D. Salt Tax: Zi. Sufficient production areas. Standardize tax rates, tighten sales areas, and in the future, concentrate as many police units as possible in the production areas to strengthen control of salt fields and eliminate private leakage. Chou. Establish a supplementary collection line: For smuggled salt in the Communist-controlled areas, a temporary inspection and supplementary collection line will be established near the Communist-controlled areas, taxes will be supplemented, and sales will be released. Tax reductions will be made in the areas long disturbed by the Communist bandits in Eastern Shandong and Northern Shaanxi.

C. Improvement of Tax Collection Procedures

A. Direct Taxes: Zi. Advance the payment of business income tax, to be paid semi-annually. To facilitate tax assessment, the tax amount for the entire previous year will be halved, and then adjusted based on the price index to calculate the increased amount for payment. Chou. Clearly stipulate that withholding agents are responsible for paying the second, third, fourth, and fifth categories of income tax, to clarify responsibility and prevent evasion.

B. Commodity Tax: Simplify the cigarette tax collection method. Implement graded taxation on a trial basis, classifying cigarettes into nine grades based on their price and quality to determine the tax amount to be collected, to avoid the trouble of individual evaluation.

C. Customs Duties: Zi. Refer to the "International Convention on the Simplification of Customs Formalities" and simplify and facilitate all necessary customs procedures as much as possible. Chou. Utilize the coastal and border customs agencies to collect commodity taxes and implement laws and regulations related to import and export, such as prohibition of transportation and foreign exchange settlement.

D. Salt Tax: Zi. Collect tax at the warehouse and release salt at designated locations. For all edible salt nationwide, except for salt sold locally and salt sold by ticket, and salt transported between regions by individual merchants, which should still be handled, the salt authorities will raise funds to purchase salt from salt fields, transport it to important distribution hubs in the sales areas, store it in warehouses, determine the warehouse price, collect tax at the warehouse, and release the salt for sale. This will solve the difficulty of merchants raising funds, stabilize salt prices, and increase national treasury revenue. Chou. Centralized management. The location for warehousing should be based on the principle of using the originally established important distribution hubs in the sales areas, with official warehouses available for supply, to facilitate centralized management and save expenses.

Original Plan (5) Enemy and puppet properties and surplus materials should be sold quickly, and state-owned enterprises that do not need to be operated by the government should be sold to private enterprises by issuing stocks or other means.

Implementation measures:

A. Handling of enemy and puppet properties

Proceed with acceleration according to the "Measures for Accelerating the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Properties" and the implementing rules, and formulate steps for implementation within a limited time according to the following methods. Zi. Divide the country into several regions and assign personnel to supervise business, audit revenue and expenditure, and ensure that income from the handling of enemy and puppet properties is quickly remitted to the treasury. Chou. Avoid retention by various agencies as much as possible, and adopt the principle of paying the current price to reduce transfers. Yin. For enemy and puppet properties occupied by military agencies, please have the Executive Yuan send personnel to lead those appointed by the Ministries of Finance and National Defense to conduct on-site inspections in various places, handle them practically according to needs.

B. Handling of surplus materials

Surplus materials from the US military should be handled expeditiously. Except for materials available for construction and applied for by government agencies, other materials should be sold off quickly or entrusted to merchants for consignment sales, as follows: Zi. Step up the transfer of surplus materials. Those issued by the government should be quickly allocated according to category and use, and prioritized for requisition by the original applying agencies. Simplify the requisition and issuance procedures and the procedures with the syndicate to prevent material decay and reduce their utility. Chou. All materials should be based on the principle of paying cash for delivery. When various agencies apply for requisition, they often request off-budget transfers or transfers at the original price when the contract was signed with the United States, and expand the scope of appropriated materials. In the future, these should be deducted from their original and additional budgets, and the scope of transfers should be tightened. Other materials will be sold at market prices and the proceeds will be remitted to the treasury. Yin. Accelerate the processing of materials to be auctioned. Daily necessities and vehicle parts that can be sold off in the short term should be entrusted to merchants for consignment sales. Items other than those requisitioned by agencies may be purchased by foreign merchants paying in foreign exchange to increase foreign exchange reserves. Damaged items will be sold at auction, and the reserve prices of various types of materials will be assessed in advance and sold publicly. Mao. Select and purchase the mechanical materials and materials not shipped from the islands in the Western Pacific by the United States at island prices, obtaining foreign exchange and saving transportation costs.

C. Sale of state-owned enterprises

To convert state-owned production enterprises to private management, determine the method of transfer based on the nature and current status of each state-owned enterprise, as follows: Zi. Sell off in full. The competent authorities should quickly assess the total assets of state-owned enterprises such as the China Textile Company and sell them to private management. Chou. Issue shares. The competent authorities should set a deadline and quickly estimate the total value and issue shares for all state-owned enterprises available for private management and sell them publicly. Yin. Hold auctions. The competent authorities should quickly estimate the auction price based on the market price and business conditions of some state-owned enterprises and sell them off as soon as possible.

Original Plan (6) Promote the issuance of public bonds to absorb idle funds to compensate for the shortfall in fiscal revenue.

Implementation measures:

A. Domestic debt raising

(Zi) The issuance methods of the two types of bonds, the 36-year short-term treasury bills and the US dollar bonds, should be improved. Short-term treasury bills were originally sold based on the central bank's US dollar exchange rate, but since the foreign exchange management measures were revised, they will continue to be sold based on the designated bank's listed market price for the US dollar. US dollar bonds were originally intended to be purchased with US dollars and other foreign currencies and gold, but the British pound has fallen in price and cannot be exchanged everywhere. They should be temporarily changed to be purchased with US dollars.

(Chou) Launch a nationwide campaign to encourage wealthy people to purchase bonds, and the Ministry of Finance should consult with relevant agencies to conduct a rigorous investigation of the sales targets. Leaders from the party, government, military, and all walks of life should be the first to purchase bonds to set an example. After overseas depositors declare their deposits, formulate measures to promote bond purchases to expand sales. (Yin) Launch a bond purchase campaign among overseas Chinese, and the Ministry of Finance should consult with relevant agencies to use propaganda methods to solicit donations. When necessary, the competent authorities may send personnel to assist in various places overseas. (Mao) First allow foreign currency bonds to be listed and traded on the exchange, use public bond policies to regulate the financial market, (Chen) Plan to continue issuing new bonds worth 300 million US dollars at an appropriate time, improving the conditions as much as possible to facilitate sales.

B. Borrowing of foreign debt

(Zi) Coordinate with the currency system reform plan and consult with foreign governments to order large loans to serve as preparation. (Chou) Coordinate with the economic construction plan, consult with various ministries and commissions to formulate plans, and contact the US Export-Import Bank and the International Bank to borrow loans to promote construction and increase production. (Yin) When restoring the repayment of foreign debt, consult to improve the repayment conditions to reduce the burden.

Original Plan (7) Prioritize allowing the purchase of foreign exchange from the Central Bank with gold for the purchase of permissible imported goods.

Implementation measures:

See the financial portion for details.

Original Plan (8) Based on the needs of national construction, determine the abolishment of agencies. Agencies that are too large must be streamlined, and agencies with redundant functions must be merged.

Implementation measures: (A) For all military and political agencies and their state-owned enterprise agencies and affiliated agencies, those with the same nature and business should be merged separately and assigned to the more closely related competent authorities. The Executive Yuan will organize a group to discuss and implement this within a limited time. (B) The number of general affairs, personnel, accounting, and statistics personnel in business agencies should be reduced as much as possible, to a maximum of 30% of the number of business personnel. (C) The collection fees of tax agencies should be reduced as much as possible and the ratio of revenue to expenditure should be stipulated. Those whose expenses exceed the ratio should be abolished or merged. (To be continued)

### Britain and Iraq Formally Sign 20-Year Treaty of Alliance, Stipulating Methods of Military Cooperation Between the Two Sides

[United Press, London, 15th] Britain and Iraq today signed a 20-year treaty of alliance, under which Britain can immediately secure military bases and dispatch British troops to Iraq in the event that either country "becomes involved in war or is threatened by war." Under the treaty, a "British-Iraqi Defense Council" will be established to coordinate United Nations strategy, command and direct Iraqi forces, and to arrange annual training exercises involving British and Iraqi air forces. Britain also relinquishes its previous right to garrison troops in Iraq during peacetime and to interfere in Iraq's foreign policy.

[Reuters, Portsmouth, 15th] British Foreign Minister Bevin and Iraqi Prime Minister Jamil al-Madfai today signed the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty, which replaces the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi treaty, in Portsmouth. Before signing, Bevin stated that "this treaty is the beginning of several similar treaties, all of which demonstrate Britain's friendship with the Arab world." Madfai replied that the treaty shows that both Britain and Iraq are willing to coexist as free and equal allies and friends. "In today's turbulent world, this treaty can enable the world to work together for international peace and prosperity." Bevin also said that "we have revised all the points that could be criticized in the old treaty. The new treaty was chosen to be signed in Portsmouth because the Iraqi delegation wanted to see the British naval facilities and docks." In addition to reaffirming the Anglo-Iraqi alliance, one of the most important articles is Article 3, which stipulates mutual assistance in wartime and the methods of mutual assistance, which are detailed in the treaty's military annex. It states that when one of the treaty countries is involved in war or feels threatened by war, Iraq will ask Britain to immediately send the necessary troops and transport all weapons to Iraq, and the Iraqi King will provide Britain with all facilities within Iraqi territory, including transportation equipment, on financial terms equal to those applicable to the Iraqi army. The annex also stipulates that Britain will continue to train the Iraqi air force and army, and will continue to supply the Iraqi army with modern weapons in accordance with current methods. The British army also has the right of transit in Iraq during peacetime, and the British government will transfer its wartime military facilities in Basra to Iraq free of charge. An exchange of letters between Britain and Iraq also stipulates that Britain will provide Iraq with economic and social assistance.

### Anglo-American Combined Zone Takes Active Steps to Restore German Foreign Trade, General Clay Issues Report on German Governance

[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] General Clay's (Commander of the US Occupation Zone) November 1947 Report on German Governance was released today, in which he strongly emphasized that the Anglo-American Combined Zone is able to and must play an important role in the general European recovery mission. The report states that the Anglo-American Combined Zone has taken active steps to formally launch import and export trade with the sixteen European countries. With the exception of Britain and the Soviet Union, the only European countries that have not yet established trade agreements with the Combined Zone are Portugal, Spain, and Romania.

To restore export trade and complete export targets, an international exchange rate for the Mark should be set to establish satisfactory trade relations between the Combined Zone and Europe and the rest of the world. Before the war, one-sixth of the total foreign trade was accounted for by the Eastern European countries of Czechoslovakia, the Balkans, Poland, Finland, and the Soviet Union. Germany, especially West Germany, has always been an integral part of the Western European economy. Even now, when the economic level of West Germany is low, Ruhr coal and coking coal are still supplied in large quantities to France, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Scandinavian countries. Without Ruhr coal, the situation would be worse today. If the Marshall Plan for European Recovery can be implemented as scheduled, then by 1949 and 1950, the Combined Zone will be able to supply more materials to other European countries. Within five years, the Combined Zone's exports to European neighbors can exceed imports.

### French Prime Minister Receives Koenig

### Communist International Conspiracy: 10,000 Workers in Three Cities in the Ruhr Area to Strike

[Reuters, London, 15th] A Foreign Office spokesman said: The Foreign Office has no reason to doubt the veracity of the rumor that the Communist International Information Bureau issued "Plan M" to the Communist Party in the Ruhr area to undermine the Marshall Plan. After the Foreign Office received this secret plan from the British authorities in Germany, it was carefully studied, but the names of the Communist Party members listed in the secret document are not known in the Ruhr area. They are thought to be pseudonyms or masterminds outside the Ruhr area.

[United Press, Berlin, 15th] More than 100,000 workers in three cities in the Ruhr area have been ordered to go on strike on the 16th. The Allied occupation authorities believe that this is probably part of a Communist Party conspiracy to launch strikes throughout the west to destroy the Marshall Plan. Strikes have already been called in the three cities of Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen, and Oberhausen. Prior to this, the US military government authorities had made a strong response to the Soviet conspiracy attempts. The US authorities also informed the unnamed, that they would play a key role in the Marshall Recovery Plan, and that if they cooperated, Germany's recovery could be expected. Reliable sources told United Press that British counterintelligence personnel are searching for the secret strike plan initiated by the Communist Party.

[Associated Press, Cairo, 15th] The Arab League today announced that it has notified its seven member states to send regular troops to occupy the entire territory of Palestine when British troops withdraw from Palestine on August 1st of this year. If an international peacekeeping force arrives before the British troops withdraw, it will be considered an unfriendly act, and the Arab League will take countermeasures.

Then, Katayama, in his capacity as party chairman, delivered a speech stating: "It has been half a year since the formation of the cabinet. During this time, we have diligently worked for the stability and improvement of the people's lives. However, due to the severe economic difficulties following the defeat in the war, our policies have not been implemented as desired, which is regrettable."

"However, to rebuild the collapsing economy, there is no other way than to rely on the strength of the democratic forces centered on the Socialist Party. Since I formed the cabinet, I have been in charge of the political situation from the standpoint of the working class. While I must seek the implementation of socialist policies, I intend to do so through peaceful means of democracy. Although there has been various criticisms of the current cabinet, I am willing to accept legitimate criticism. However, things have an order and a limit. I hope that all party members will demonstrate the spirit of trust and friendship between comrades and give their full support." Subsequently, Chairman Matsuoka reported on party affairs over the past year, and Nishio reported on the achievements of the Katayama cabinet over the past year and future policies. Afterwards, local councilors engaged in fierce debates on the proposals, and the confrontation between the left and right factions was particularly evident.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The Socialist Party Congress was held today at the Nihon University hall in Tokyo. The atmosphere was unusually tense. It is expected that policy issues will be the focus of debate among the various factions of the party during this congress.

### Back to the Netherlands

— By Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

(Hague Dispatch) Before the war, there were two peaceful and happy sister countries on the coast of Western Europe, one was Belgium, and the other was the Netherlands. After six years of war, Belgium has not only restored its pre-war prosperity, but also, because it possesses the vast African "Congo" colony, which produces large amounts of "uranium" ore, has now become the second richest country in the world after the United States. Today, when the Dutch think of Belgium, they often express envy from the bottom of their hearts, and at the same time, they feel sadness from the bottom of their hearts!

The East Indies dispute was a fatal blow to the Netherlands after the war. "100,000 troops" are now trapped in Java and Sumatra. As long as the state of war continues, the supply of raw materials from the former colonies and the market for industrial goods cannot be restored. According to unofficial estimates from The Hague: the Dutch government's initial military costs for the Indonesian war, the heavy tax burdens, the shortage of materials, and the reduction in transportation capacity are all enough to deepen the Netherlands' current predicament. The current Prime Minister, Dr. Beel of the Catholic Party, once stated in the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament: as long as the Indonesian problem can be resolved "quickly and cleanly", no matter what the conditions of the resolution, including any price, it would always be good for improving the current situation in the Netherlands! Therefore, not long after Dr. Beel took office, he hurriedly risked his life and flew to the East Indies!

I arrived in The Hague five days before Christmas last year, shortly after Prime Minister Beel flew away from the Netherlands. Mr. Mu'er, the head of the press office of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sent me a copy of the Prime Minister's face-to-face conversation before his departure, the gist of which was: the Dutch government is determined to achieve a rational solution to the Indonesian dispute, so as not to allow the situation in the East Indies to deteriorate further, "but if the government of the Republic of Indonesia acts blindly, then the Dutch government will not hesitate to make all sacrifices to fight for justice and order." At that time, many officials in The Hague did believe that the current government would take a tougher policy, but some Dutch friends told me: the Netherlands' position can no longer continue to "fight" down. The Netherlands attaches more importance to the economic aspects of the East Indies than to the political aspects. As long as the Dutch government continues to maintain special economic rights in Indonesia, the Dutch government can make even greater concessions politically, which is not a concern.

Regarding the two opinions, I sympathize with the latter. Because I am confident that I understand the character of the Dutch quite well. Two years and five months ago, not long after Nazi Germany surrendered, I had been to the Netherlands. At that time, it was not long after liberation, and everything was in chaos, but the excitement and revelry of the Dutch were far above that of the French and Belgians. At that time, I was still a "war correspondent", living in the headquarters of the Canadian Army in "Utrecht", the fourth largest city in the Netherlands. I met, saw, and talked with many Dutch people every day. From the common English they spoke, I knew that the Dutch often revealed an excessive "sense of self-esteem". In Chinese slang, the Dutch often "care too much about face". Sometimes, it can even surprise the most face-conscious Chinese.

Other Europeans call the Dutch a "cold-blooded nation". I remember more than two years ago, at the residence of Mr. Zhang Guoshu, a leader of the overseas Chinese community in The Hague, I met a scholar of Oriental languages who called himself a "China expert". He said that the Dutch are called the "Chinese of Europe" and that the philosophy of the Dutch is similar to that of China. He even strongly compared Spinoza, the great philosopher who grew up in the Netherlands, to Confucius of China. This time, I did not talk to Zhang Guoshu about this person, but my impression of the Dutch is still the same as it was more than two years ago. The Dutch are not as serious and cold-blooded as the Chinese, but in many places, they are indeed learning from the British in every way.

English in the Netherlands is almost as common as the Dutch national language. In fact, German and Dutch are very similar. We speak Dutch, but we only use English when absolutely necessary. Germany was defeated, and speaking German in the Netherlands is more or less considered an "indecent" thing. A friend told me that in the Dutch national anthem, there is a sentence that says: "We are proud because we have the blood of the Germanic nation," but the Dutch are absolutely unwilling to mention this matter. I know that it is an impolite act to peel the "sore" of a person who cares about face.

But, in any case, the Netherlands is still a "land of culture and artifacts". Living in this small country of more than nine million people, there is a feeling of elegance and kindness everywhere. General Jiang Dingwen came to the Netherlands on New Year's Eve and praised the cleanliness of The Hague. In winter, the temperature hovers around freezing, but you can see exotic flowers and plants everywhere in the Netherlands. Blood-red roses, bright peonies, and even all kinds of plum blossoms, orchids, chrysanthemums, and bamboos. Many Dutch people are often proud of their "floral world", but I think what they can be even more proud of is more than this.

The story of "Jingwei filling the sea" in Chinese history has been fully realized in the Netherlands. No other country can match the Dutch engineers' control over seawater. In the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, there is still a historical map hanging, showing that during the ancient Roman Empire, the Netherlands was all low-lying lake areas. The geographical Netherlands of today has been gradually filled up since the 16th and 17th centuries. The English word "Netherlands" means low-lying wetlands. Even now, 40% of the land in the Netherlands is lower than the sea level at high tide. 25% of the land is absolutely below sea level.

Looking at this aspect, the Dutch people's achievement of "conquering nature" is worthy of special mention. They not only built embankments in the lowlands, but also filled in several corners of the "Zuiderzee". On December 28, 1925, Dutch engineers completed the dike at the mouth of the "Zuiderzee", blocking the waves of the North Sea. Then, the land reclamation work of "Wieringermeer" was completed, and the former blue waves of the sea turned into beautiful pastoral land.

Seventeen days before the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945, on the morning of April 17th, the commander-in-chief of the German army stationed in the Netherlands ordered the Dutch residents of "Wieringermeer" to evacuate quickly. Then, at 12:15 noon, the dam was breached, and the tide poured in. That unprecedented catastrophe was a groundbreaking event in Dutch history. The loss of people, livestock, cattle, and sheep was incalculable. Today, the Dutch still gnash their teeth when they talk about the German army, just as we recall the Japanese robbers breaching the Yellow River in 1938. But the spirit of the Dutch is still admirable. On the third day after the Nazi defeat, the Dutch dike repair project immediately began, and the closing project was completed in just three months.

Mr. Pu Xi of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Office told me many stories of "water control". He said that the Dutch government is now planning to fill in the southwestern part of the "Zuiderzee", reducing the area of the existing Zuiderzee by half. Once this plan is realized, the country can add at least 500,000 acres of arable land, and the Netherlands' valuable agricultural products are expected to more than double.

More than two years ago, when I came to the Netherlands, because I was just passing through in a hurry, I did not visit the embankment. This time, despite the severe winter, I still braved the wind and rain and took a trip to the northwest coast of the Zuiderzee. My simple impression reminded me of the TVA water conservancy project in Tennessee, USA. The TVA is to prevent flood surges in the plateau mountains, while the Zuiderzee water conservancy project is to prevent seawater intrusion. Although the structure and construction of the two are completely different, they both have a close connection with China in terms of water control.

Today, many countries around the world send students to study water conservancy engineering here. I heard that two Chinese students were also sent to The Hague last year. Unfortunately, because I was too rushed for time, I did not visit the Dutch National University of Technology, which is known for its water conservancy. (January 7, Hotel de Zalm, The Hague)

[This Newspaper's Report] The North China Petition Delegation, consisting of Liu Yaozhang, Speaker of the Hebei Provincial Temporary Council; Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Beiping Municipal Council; Shi Zizhou, Speaker of the Tianjin Municipal Council; and Li Zhushu and Ji Dianchuan, representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, a total of five individuals, arrived in Shanghai on the 14th. They paid visits to Mayor Wu and President Zhang for discussions. Originally scheduled to travel to Nanjing by train on the evening of the 15th, the trip was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances until the evening of the 16th. In Nanjing, they will separately visit Chairman Chiang, President Zhang, and the heads of relevant ministries and commissions to present reports on the crisis in North China, requesting prompt solutions.

Speaker Liu Yaozhang and others, on the afternoon of the 16th, accepted an invitation from Mr. Liu Yizhi of Yi Shi Bao and Mr. Cao Gubing of Da Gong Bao to attend a banquet hosted by the press. During the banquet, they explained the purpose of their petitioning in Nanjing and detailed the suffering endured in North China, appealing to the Shanghai press for assistance in jointly conveying the importance of North China to the central government. After Speaker Liu's address, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of this newspaper, Mr. Qi Jianzhong, Director of Southeast Daily, and Mr. Wang Yunsheng, Editor-in-Chief of Da Gong Bao, delivered speeches successively, unanimously urging the government to pay attention to the economic crisis in North China and to devise solutions as soon as possible.

Speaker Liu pointed out that the people of the Yellow River basin and the Yangtze River basin are closely interconnected. Currently, North China is experiencing a grain shortage, while Shanghai is facing a coal shortage. This illustrates the close relationship between the two regions. How to strengthen the transportation of coal from the north to the south and grain from the south to the north in the future is an urgent issue. The seriousness of the situation in North China is more economic than political, and more political than military, with all three being intertwined. This delegation, representing tens of millions of compatriots in North China, is petitioning primarily on economic grounds, hoping that the central government will continuously support increased industrial and agricultural production, smooth the flow of grain, and facilitate the circulation of currency. The central government is undoubtedly concerned about this, but unfortunately, there are still areas where the spirit is not fully penetrating, so we have come south to present a detailed account to the central government for consideration. Here are a few simple examples.

### Export Goods Piling Up and Rotting, Mining Equipment Unable to Be Replenished

Tianjin's exports account for approximately 12% of the national total, but the allocation of foreign exchange for imports is less than 4%. As a result, export goods are piling up and rotting on the one hand, while the equipment for various factories and mines cannot be replenished on the other. Tianjin has always had a trade deficit with Shanghai, so when the Shanghai foreign exchange ceased, two phenomena immediately occurred: first, the exchange rate soared, stimulating prices; second, cash was transported for import, and capital flowed south. The flow of capital southward has been continuous, and last August, it was rumored to be as high as 800 billion (including transfers from areas other than Beiping and Tianjin). As a result, the regular turnover in Beiping and Tianjin is only 300-400 billion, with Beiping having less than 100 billion, which is less than that of a single bank in Shanghai. The anemia is worsening. After the suspension of production loans, Huaxin, Hengyuan, and Beiyang textile mills have already reduced working hours and laid off employees. Of the three Shoufeng flour mills, only one is operating. Small and medium-sized factories, such as the soap industry, have only 23 of 54 factories in Tianjin operating. The oil extraction industry has almost entirely ceased production. Of the 54 dyeing factories, the output of those in operation is less than one-fifth. It is feared that by the Lunar New Year, not only will raw materials be impossible to purchase, but also wages will not be able to be paid. The Changlu salt production urgently needs government loans to cover drying costs; otherwise, not only will the production increase plan fall through, but output may be drastically reduced. The Beijing-Shanghai area has a great need for coal, but the selling price of coal is only 1.08 million per ton, while the selling price in Shanghai reaches 7-8 million, a difference that seems unreasonable.

Rice and Flour Expensive

The selling price of flour in Shanghai is about 600,000 per bag, while in Beiping and Tianjin, it has reached 1.2 million, because each bag must also pay 150,000 for the permission certificate fee, another 150,000 for the exchange fee, plus transportation costs, etc. The high price of rice in Beiping and Tianjin is 16,000 per catty, which is two to three times more expensive than in Shanghai. Generally, due to various restrictions on grain, such as permits, re-exports, and quotas, merchants hesitate to advance. The efficiency of government agencies is slightly lacking, and the amount transported north in name often fails to meet the urgency of the situation. Or the population figures of Tianjin do not fully match the export figures of Shanghai. Before the war, about 2 million bags of flour were transported from Shanghai to Tianjin each month, with miscellaneous grains from Hebei and the Northeast and Northwest excluded. Recently, the population of Beiping and Tianjin is no less than 3.5 million, exceeding the pre-war level, and the source of miscellaneous grains has almost been cut off. Even if 450,000 bags of flour are transported from Shanghai to Tianjin each month, it is still far from meeting the demand.

Farmland Abandoned, Cotton Production Insufficient

At least 200,000 to 300,000 mu of farmland (not entirely in communist areas) that Japan had already reclaimed in North China is lying fallow, and at least one-half of the food in Hebei and Tianjin, based on last year's figures, needs to be transported from the Yangtze River basin for relief. However, Hebei was not included in the first or second year of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's five-year grain production increase plan. The current cotton-producing areas in Hebei have only one-half of their original holdings, and last year's cotton production was not even enough to meet one-half of the needs of the textile factories in Hebei and Tianjin. If no foreign cotton is shipped in three months, production cannot be maintained. But this year's cotton loan is still undecided. Last year, Hebei's land tax was collected from 330,000 shi in 47 counties and cities. To date, 13 counties and cities have fallen one after another, and the total amount collected is less than one-half, mostly consumed by security teams and self-defense corps, and cannot be allocated for military rations. As for the purchase price, it is only about one-eighth of the market price, which is even more difficult.

In order to solve the above problems, we sincerely hope that the central government will consider the following measures: Encourage exports, try a linked system, with import quotas accounting for at least 20% of the national total, purchase production equipment, and please allow long-term foreign exchange settlement. Open the Shanghai foreign exchange. Restore production loans and change the hypothecation method. Please quickly negotiate with the United States to purchase wheat and rush it to China. Maintain salt loans and increase salt production. Lift restrictions on the transport of grain from the south to the north and implement the exchange of coal for grain. Increase grain and cotton production and provide generous loans.

### US Consul General Hosts Reporters, First Lesson is Learning Mandarin, Willing to Work to Restore Normal Trade

[This Newspaper's Report] The newly appointed US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, arrived in Shanghai with his wife and daughter. Yesterday morning at 11:30, he held an informal press conference in his office in the Construction Building, making a statement to reporters from various newspapers in the city. At 2:30 in the afternoon, he hosted reporters from foreign newspapers stationed in Shanghai.

During the meeting, Cabot stated that he had decided to learn Chinese and would make learning Chinese one of his initial tasks. When reporters asked about his views on US businesses operating in China, Cabot said that restoring normal trade relations was extremely important after the war. He himself was willing to work towards this restoration. He also stated that the success or failure of trade is related to the normalcy of economic and political conditions and must also depend on the confidence of traders in these conditions.

Cabot further stated that US businessmen operating in China should do their best to comply with the management and restriction measures currently established by the Chinese government, as there is a need for the Chinese government to implement these measures. However, if US businesses find it impossible to proceed according to the regulations, the US government can point out to the Chinese government that these measures are detrimental to the interests of both China and the United States, so that the Chinese government can understand the actual situation.

Regarding the views of the general American public on the current situation in the country, Cabot replied that opinions in the United States varied. However, their basic view is the same, which is that they are unanimously willing to help China alleviate its difficult situation and express respect for China's independence and sovereignty.

After arriving in Shanghai, Cabot has been busy with social engagements and will meet with various leaders of the city. He will visit Mayor Wu in the coming days. This afternoon at 6:00, Mr. and Mrs. Cabot will attend a dinner at 70 Route Say Zoong at the invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Bielski, the acting Consul General.

### Chamber of Commerce on Kowloon Incident, Submits Petition to Chairman for Serious Negotiations

The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce expressed outrage over the Hong Kong government's dispatch of armed police to force residents in Kowloon City to relocate and forcibly demolish civilian houses. On the 16th, it telegraphed Chairman Chiang of the National Government, President Zhang, and Foreign Minister Wang, requesting serious negotiations and expressing its commitment to fully support the government. The original telegram is recorded below: (Formalities omitted) The Hong Kong government has three times forced residents in Kowloon City to relocate, and recently dispatched armed police to forcibly demolish civilian houses, firing shots and causing trouble, and arresting residents' representatives, sentencing them to hard labor, encroaching on our territory, undermining our sovereignty, insulting our people, and acting recklessly, still in the old imperialist manner. The Kowloon Peninsula Lease Treaty stipulates that the Kowloon City area was not originally included in the lease, and the administration of the city area has always been under the jurisdiction of our government officials. Regardless of the original text of the treaty and historical facts, there should be no misinterpretation. China and Britain have always had cordial relations, and even shared adversity during the war. While trade between the two countries is gradually being promoted, the Hong Kong authorities acted recklessly, leading to this unfortunate incident. What is the meaning of benevolence and friendship? What is the meaning of international justice? In order to safeguard our country's sovereignty and protect the lives and property of our people, we should demand that the Hong Kong government immediately release the arrested residents' representatives, investigate and compensate the losses of the affected residents. Severely punish the perpetrators and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. If necessary, we should request that our government resolutely adopt tough diplomacy, with the great spirit of abolishing unequal treaties, seriously negotiate, and reclaim what is not intact on a specific date, vowing to fully support the government, to the utmost of our urgent prayer. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, all directors and supervisors kowtow, Yin Zixian.

### International Gold and Dollar Case, Criminals Escorted, Family Members Weeping

[This Newspaper's Report] The international gold and dollar black market case involving criminals Maddox and 16 others was transferred by the police station to the District Prosecutor's Office at 5:30 pm yesterday, along with the seized evidence (the gold and dollar portions were sent separately to the National Bank for safekeeping). This is the largest and most significant gold and dollar case cracked in the city to date in terms of the number of criminals involved. When they were brought out of the police station's detention center, they were all handcuffed, heads bowed, and looking dejected. Before their arrest, they were all well-known figures who manipulated gold and dollars. When they were escorted yesterday, their prestige had vanished, and they were shivering in the cold wind. Their families followed behind, crying and calling out, creating a rather pitiful scene.

### Housing Charity Sale Tickets, Worth Promoting for Gift-Giving, Formal Tickets to be Issued Regularly

The formal tickets for the housing charity sale issued by the Winter Relief Association's Housing Charity Sale Department were all printed yesterday. At 4:00 pm yesterday, the association convened representatives from various banks, shops, newspaper offices, and companies that managed the sales, at the City Bank on the fourth floor, to discuss exchange and issuance methods.

The pre-order voucher numbers are not the winning numbers; the formal ticket numbers are the winning numbers. From today, various banks, shops, newspaper offices, and companies will simultaneously promote the purchase of "housing charity sale tickets" for gifts during the Spring Festival and for giving New Year's money. The association has also printed exquisite red envelopes with the four auspicious characters "吉祥如意" (Good Fortune as You Wish) and a picture of a house for decoration.

### Winter Relief Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Refugees from Zhabei Fire

### Severe Coal Shortage, Expected to Be Resolved in Short Term, Consumption by Public Utilities Not to Be Reduced Temporarily

[This Newspaper's Report] This year's coal shortage has entered its most severe stage. It is understood that the city's current coal reserves are only sufficient for 35 days, lasting until about February 20th. The Fuel Management Committee convened a meeting on this matter and decided to request that various public utilities under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Bureau immediately reduce coal consumption by half, in an attempt to remedy the situation. The Public Utilities Bureau uses coal as its largest driving force. If the amount of coal is reduced by half, work must also be suspended by half, which would greatly affect the citizens' basic needs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. After discussion at the municipal government's municipal affairs meeting, it was decided to reluctantly maintain the status quo and temporarily not reduce the amount of coal. However, each company will be responsible for conserving as much as possible and using it carefully in order to overcome the current difficulties together.

However, according to Director Zhao's statement yesterday: the severe coal shortage is expected to be resolved in the short term. The city currently has more than 70,000 tons of coal in reserve. Approximately 40,000 tons of coal are being shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai, and another 40,000 tons are being shipped from Central China to Shanghai. Moreover, the average coal reserves of various public utility companies in the city are sufficient for 20 days of use. The central government has now ordered the Central Bank to allocate foreign exchange for the Central Trust Bureau to purchase 100,000 tons of American coal, which is expected to arrive around February 20th. Furthermore, Director Shi of the Beining Railway telegraphed, informing that the railway from Kailuan to Xingang has been opened, and the first train has already departed, so the coal reserves there can be continuously transported to supply Shanghai.

In order to alleviate the grain shortage in North China, encourage exports, and revive construction,

The Tianjin Importers and Exporters Association has provided the authorities with four main recommendations, which the North China petition delegation carried to Beijing on the evening of the 16th. The contents of the recommendations are as follows: Use foreign exchange from exports to exchange for foreign wheat flour. Method: According to the association's estimates of export goods, the total export amount may increase to US$10 million within March, April and May of this year due to the encouragement of the grain exchange method. Calculated according to the price of American and Canadian flour, it can import one million bags of flour, which is sufficient for the needs of the North for three months. As for the export and import procedures, it is proposed that the Tianjin office of the Transportation and Supervision Committee be responsible for handling them, with the participation of the Central Bank, the Tianjin Municipal Government, and the association's responsible person. Sincerely encourage the export business to earn foreign exchange. Method: 1. Regarding loans: A. The original method of export of raw goods should be quickly restored. B. The original loan period for packaging was three months, but recently it was changed to one month. Export procedures often cannot be completed in one month, so please restore the minimum three-month period. C. The procedures for borrowers are complicated, please simplify the procedures to avoid unnecessary difficulties. 2. Regarding control: A. Export goods can be exchanged for foreign exchange and are different from general materials that may flow into communist areas. Please do not obstruct export goods that have been certified by designated banks by local material control agencies. B. The inspection standards issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the inspection of export goods often do not match the actual situation and are not required by foreign markets. Please instruct the relevant authorities to provide effective assistance and flexibility to exporters. 3. Regarding local barriers: The export of local products from the North is restricted by local government orders, and goods that can be transported smoothly, such as soybeans, oils, and hides, are subject to layers of control, causing many obstacles. Please order the governments in each producing area to lift these barriers. Import quotas are too small and far from meeting the needs of North China's industrial construction. Please relax them as much as possible so that the North's recovery work can proceed smoothly. Method: Please increase the reasonable share of the national import foreign exchange quota according to the Northern import situation before the war and the current needs of industry and mining. The Tianjin Transportation Control Committee, the Industrial Association, and the Association will be responsible for the investigation and request approval. The linked system is a relatively good method to save foreign exchange depletion and adjust international trade. Please adopt and implement it. Method: Import goods are still restricted according to government regulations to prevent the import of unnecessary items. The percentage of export foreign exchange that should be returned to the national treasury and technical issues should be handled by the Transportation Control Committee, the Central Bank, and the Association in consideration of the situation in the North.

### Legislative Election, Reaching White-Hot Stage

[This Newspaper's Report] The legislative election in this city has reached a white-hot stage. At 9:00 am yesterday, the Civil Affairs Bureau convened more than 200 staff members and Baozhangs from the six districts of Hongkou, North Station, Tilanqiao, Jianlin, Yangshupu, and Xinshijie, and held a meeting at the Yong'an Grand Theater on Yokohama Bridge. Candidates such as Fang Zhichao were present. Director Zhang chaired the meeting, reported, and introduced each candidate separately. Subsequently, each candidate delivered a speech successively. Also, at 8:00 pm last night, Fang Zhichao again broadcast his election platform on the Junsheng Radio Station.

Tongji University students Shi Yun, Chen Zhenxi, Fang Shanshu, Xu Xuewu, Xu Rongfan, Pan Zuyong, etc., in support of former professor Fang Zhichao's legislative election, held a pre-celebration dinner party at the Yijing Club on Shaoxing Road last night. More than 200 people were present. Pan Zuyong chaired the meeting and delivered a speech, expressing support and pre-celebration. Professor Fang was also invited to express his election opinions.

Zhou Yizhi is running for legislative election in this city area. Yesterday, Vice Chairman Sun specially wrote a recommendation for him. The original text reads: "Exercising constitutionalism is a major event in China today, and it is related to the fate of China in the future, as everyone knows. The election of National Assembly representatives has been completed, and now the legislative election is underway. According to the Constitution, the duties of the Legislative Yuan will be very important in the future, so the selection of legislative candidates has become a problem that the whole country attaches great importance to. Shanghai is China's largest city, an area of international importance, where most of China's industrial and commercial strength is concentrated, and it is also the base for China's cultural development, so the election of Shanghai's legislative members should be even more solemn. Former legislator Comrade Zhou Yizhi has been in office for fifteen years and should have experience in legislative work. He has always advocated democracy and insisted on justice, which I think is also well known to all walks of life. He is currently practicing law in Shanghai, has been nominated by a political party, and is participating in the election. Because I have known him for many years of revolution and he is determined to serve the people, I would like to recommend him to all citizens of Shanghai with sincerity and honesty, hoping that everyone will vote for Comrade Zhou Yizhi!"

Xie Renzhao

Auditing Director of the Municipal Party Department, Legislative Candidate

Xie Renzhao held a press conference at 48 Fuming Village yesterday afternoon to announce his election platform, advocating good people's politics, promoting the spirit of the rule of law, advocating industrial salvation, pursuing independent diplomacy, promoting Shanghai's construction, and representing the interests of the majority.

Liu Piji, the current director of the Six District Cotton Spinning Association, and Wang Zhuyi (pictured), the association's deputy secretary-general, both legislative candidates from Eastern District industrial and mining groups, gave their election speeches at the Kangle Yujia yesterday. More than 100 people were present. Liu has been involved in the textile industry since he was a child. During the Anti-Japanese War, his factory moved inland, and he later founded the Daming Textile Company. During the Anti-Japanese War, he contributed greatly to the supply of cloth in the rear, and is truly a rare talent in the industrial sector. Wang graduated from Jinan University at an early age, obtained a master's degree in economics in the United States, and returned to China to serve in politics for many years, and was deeply valued by his superiors. After the victory, he served as a member of the Shanghai Municipal Government and made many contributions to the revitalization of industry and commerce.

Two Year-End Bonus Disputes Resolved [This Newspaper's Report] The year-end bonus dispute in the machine-made sewing industry has been resolved after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau's Year-End Bonus Handling Committee. Labor and management have agreed that the standard for monthly workers' year-end bonus is one month's salary, and the standard for piece workers is fifteen days' work. Employers who are unable to afford the bonus due to business losses may negotiate on their own. Special shops can handle it on their own.

An agreement has been reached on the year-end bonus for the white weaving group of the dyeing and weaving industry. Last year, the bonus was issued in three grades, A, B, and C, each with two levels. Grade A was 50 yuan, 40 yuan, and 27 yuan. Grades B and C each decreased by 2 yuan per level. This year's year-end bonus is calculated at 80% of last year's bonus. Of this, 40% is issued according to last December's index, and 60% is issued according to the assumed index for January (last December's index plus 30%). It will be paid in full by the 26th of this month. The year-end bonus for the patterned fabric group and the dyeing and finishing group is still under negotiation and can also be resolved soon.

### 林區時裝店 為爭年獎怠工

[Report from our newspaper] Fashion industry workers in the Lin Sen district shops went on strike yesterday due to disputes over year-end bonuses. A small portion of the Jing'an Temple area also experienced similar situations. According to workers, the union petitioned the industry association to issue year-end bonuses on November 17th of last year, but the employers did not respond. The union then petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, but the employers consistently failed to send representatives. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that if there was a past practice of providing year-end bonuses, they should still be issued. As the end of the year approaches and workers urgently need to return to their hometowns, they are demanding prompt payment. Yesterday, worker representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau to request instructions from the Year-End Bonus Handling Committee, which decided to transfer the case to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for processing and advised the workers to resume work immediately.

### 承印共黨小冊 蘇僑被提公訴

[Report from our newspaper] Soviet citizen Vasily Aiyev, currently working as a doorman at the Klimen Company, was originally a printer.

### 查禁茶舞 分區執行 新舞女停止登記 傳習所再度訴願

[Report from our newspaper] After the ban on dancing and related measures arrived in the city a few days ago, the Business Section of the Police Bureau was ordered to implement them yesterday. Each sub-bureau has divided all officers into several small groups according to the location of dance halls, bars, and cafes, and dispatched them to patrol and check whether tea dances are still being held. The Police Bureau also dispatched a large number of juvenile police officers to various dance venues yesterday afternoon for inspection. The Dance Hall Industry Association has notified its 29 member dance halls to comply with the order to stop tea dances. In addition to allowing already registered dancers to transfer their registrations, the Police Bureau has stopped registering new dancers as of yesterday. However, according to statistics, the total number of registered dancers in November of last year was 2,022. Since the announcement of the ban on dancing, the total number of registered dancers has decreased to 1,645 as of yesterday. Therefore, it is expected that the number of dancers will gradually decrease after the tea dances are banned. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently planning for the aftermath of providing relief to the dancers.

In addition, there are 314 licensed cafe dancers and barmaids in the city, as well as 29 dance training schools, which are also within the scope of the ban. Representatives of the training schools held an emergency meeting last night and decided to send Bao Longyun, Li Yasheng, Zhou Yuehan, and Qian Zonglian to Nanjing by night train to appeal to the Executive Yuan again. Their reasons are: Dance schools do not train dancers, but are purely for the study of dance art. The names and qualifications of the students admitted to the dance schools can be provided to the authorities for review. The British Academy of Dance Art receives government subsidies every month. The authorities should regard dance schools as legitimate academic groups, and manage and supervise them instead of forcing them to close down. Dance school teachers have difficult lives, and the tuition fees collected are difficult to refund in a short time. Therefore, they hope that the deadline for closing down can be extended for a reasonable period. It is heard that they will spare no effort to the very end and will once again state to the authorities the pain of closing down if ordered to do so. At the same time, they have requested the Municipal Government to suspend execution until the Executive Yuan has responded to their appeal.

### 新任輸管會主任委員 霍寶樹就職視事 輸出輸入力求平衡發展

[Report from our newspaper] The newly appointed Chairman of the Import and Export Control Commission, Huo Baoshu, officially took office at 10:00 AM yesterday at the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. Huo addressed all the staff of the Control Commission, pointing out that the past management of import and export policies had been too drastic and was not appropriate. He also said that the Control Commission is a complex business organization, and that the promotion of work in the future should be as simple as possible, avoiding complexity, and put forward three principles: International trade should be fair, the quota allocation between industries should be fair, and the attitude of handling matters should be fair. The efficiency of the Control Commission will be improved to make it a sound organization. Huo particularly emphasized two points: First, the various regulations of the Control Commission will not be easily changed unless absolutely necessary, so as to avoid the suffering of merchants who do not know what to do. Second, the rights and obligations of importers should be balanced. In other words, importers should not be satisfied with obtaining quota allocations, but should further assist the government in promoting exports and earning foreign exchange.

After Huo took office, he met with reporters and gave brief answers to the various questions raised: Smuggling in South China is still rampant, but it is expected that the situation will improve in the short term because the Chinese government has now strengthened anti-smuggling measures and can obtain the cooperation of the Hong Kong government. In the future, import and export should be balanced and developed, and should be coordinated with relevant departments to adapt to current needs. The amount of import quotas should be reasonable, and the export of agricultural products in our country should be encouraged as much as possible. At present, all countries lack US dollars, so the method of barter is worth considering.

### 利用中紡餘力 解決南市電荒 併車試驗成功下月正式供電

[Report from our newspaper] The Public Works Bureau, considering that the Lunar New Year is approaching and that electricity is urgently needed for merchants and residents in the South City, is considering using the self-provided generators of China Textile Company's First, Sixth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Factories to supplement the power supply. The total capacity of the four generators is 60,000 kilowatts, and the actual power generation is 4,500 kilowatts. In addition to supplying its own use from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM every morning, China Textile Company can supply residential use during the remaining time. The Public Works Bureau plans to combine its power generation with the Shanghai Electric Power Company to transfer it to users. The above method has been successfully tested in the Sixth Factory. Liu Shengqu, Section Chief of the Bureau, Lu Futang, Chief Engineer of China Textile Company, and Anderson, Chief Engineer of Shanghai Electric Power Company, went to the China Textile Sixth Factory on Roberts Road at 7:00 AM the previous morning to participate in the combined vehicle test, which was completed at 9:40 AM. The combined vehicle work of the other three factories can also be completed by the end of this month, and power can be officially supplied from February 1st. At that time, the electricity shortage in the South City is expected to improve.

[Another dispatch] The 4,000-kilowatt generator ordered by China Merchants Electric Power Company from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has been shipped from the United States to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in February. It can be officially generating electricity this summer.

### 私售行總卡車 藍春池被偵查

[Report from our newspaper] Lan Chunchi, former Specialist Commissioner of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, is being investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office for allegedly abusing his position to sell trucks privately. While serving concurrently as Chairman of the Truck Distribution Review Committee of the Administration, Lan falsely used the name of the "Fupu Xian Automobile Transportation Company" of Fujian to purchase two three-ton Ford trucks. The District Prosecutor's Office had previously found that one truck was sold to China National Aviation Corporation for 128,650,000 yuan, and now it has been found that another truck was sold to the Sino-French Pharmacy for 40,000,000 yuan. The reason for the low price is that Lan's brother is a shareholder of the Sino-French Pharmacy and the manager of the Sino-French Serum Factory. The defendant Lan Chunchi has repeatedly failed to appear when summoned, and the District Prosecutor's Office is continuing to search for evidence.

### 張桂年的發明之夢 未完成的濬河激水機 離開實際研究試騐的科學道路 走上途徑竟妄想鉅額獎金 跟吳鼎昌薛篤弼打官司

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] "Inventor" Zhang Guinian cherished a dream of inventing a river dredging and water-pumping machine, and hoped to obtain a huge reward from the government in this dream. However, when this dream was shattered, he did not intend to investigate the reasons for his failure, but instead took legal action to sue the current Secretary-General of the National Government, Wu Dingchang, and the current Minister of Water Resources, Xue Dubi. His reason was that his invention was reported to the Ministry of Water Resources but was not approved for a long time. There was no suspicion of anyone copying it, and the government's reward for his invention should not be only 500,000 yuan. Therefore, he believed that Wu and Xue were both obliterating his hard work in invention and seemed to be deducting his bonus.

Zhang Guinian actually filed a lawsuit, and the defendants are high-ranking officials in important positions today. This is the same ability as his self-confidence in inventing a river dredging and water-pumping machine without testing it and being confident of success. At the same time, he also regularly does one thing, which is to constantly send letters to Chairman Chiang. It is said that in the past there was a period when he would write a letter every ten days. It is truly painstaking and persistent, and one cannot help but admire him! Now, this

lawsuit will be heard in the Shanghai District Court on the 27th of this month. The reporter once visited Minister Xue Dubi and asked him if he would appear in court. He smiled and said, "I will not pay attention to him. Many facts do not need me to explain, and we only regard him as a patient with mental illness." Xue's words are not without reason. Now let us take a look at the process of his invention.

Zhang Guinian is from Tianjin, 45 years old this year. He entered a private school as a child, and dropped out of school at the age of 15 due to poverty. He lived by the Haihe River in Tianjin. In 1917, North China was devastated by floods, and the Haihe River was cut straight, and the Sancha River mouth was abandoned. The river channel was straightened, but the silt accumulation could not be reduced. For the inventor Zhang Guinian, in his

residence by the Haihe River, listening to the angry sound of the water, began his motivation for invention. Of course, this motivation was to save people and the world. Finally, in the form of the water flow, he realized that there was a necessity for a new invention, so he decided to invent a river dredging and water-pumping machine to make the water flow in a circular shape, so that the water flow would not stop and there would be no more silt accumulation.

What is this thing? It is a simple machine with rotating four blades to be installed on

a flat-bottomed boat. It is made of iron plate, three zhang in diameter, and the blades are six or seven chi thick. It completely uses water flow force, has no power itself, but can convert the water flow force into impact force that can impact 50 li.

After he submitted the description of this invention to the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Water Resources sent technician Peng Dusheng to contact him. It is said that Peng went six times, talking with him each time for two or three hours. Zhang's expression to Peng was that he would not accept criticism before testing, and subjectively believed that it would be successful. Therefore, the Ministry of Water Resources, after studying and researching after not obtaining his blueprints and

test instructions and other practical examples to prove it, believed that there were many forces to be tested, so it decided to give him a subsidy of 500,000 yuan to reward Zhang for his hard work in inventing the river dredging and water-pumping machine.

That is the fact, but Zhang, based on his dream of both fame and wealth, was unwilling to settle for a subsidy of only 500,000 yuan, and finally angrily took the

legal solution.

Now, what I want to report to the reader is Zhang Guinian's character. After Zhang was fifteen years old, he worked and learned business. In 1929 and 1930, he repeatedly wrote to Chairman Chiang and General Commander Yan, talking freely about current affairs. Later, he wrote to the then Mayor of Tianjin and the provincial committees, but all were unsuccessful. In the winter of 1931, he wrote to Executive Duan again. This time he unexpectedly received a summons, but did not get any work. Finally, he wrote to the Tianjin Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and was able to work as a clerk in the Social Affairs Bureau for several years. After the Anti-Japanese War, in 1942, he left Tianjin and went to Shanghai, working in the Yarn Exchange. In December of last year, he began to write to Chairman Chiang and the Executive Yuan again, presenting the process of his invention of the river dredging and water-pumping machine, up to now.

One of the most important conditions for an inventor to possess is to accept criticism, but Zhang Guinian does not accept criticism. At the same time, there must be test instructions in the invention process, but he has never tested it and has no way to explain it. This is a kind of stubbornness that transcends reality. What will be the outcome of the lawsuit? After a trial in court on the 27th, everything will be clear. (Reported by Zhang Ming, reporter of this newspaper)

### 避讓當路野狗 人車翻身墮河 蘇州鉅商季小松 子受重傷侄兒死

[Report from our newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] A tragic traffic accident occurred in Suzhou on the afternoon of the 14th, with one death and one injury. Ji Xiaosong, a wealthy timber merchant who is a well-known figure in the local business community and former president of the Chamber of Commerce, was recently recuperating at home. At about 3:00 PM on the 14th, his son Shanchu went out to handle business with his cousin Kunyi. They rode their own machine bicycles, and when they passed the Pinghua Bridge on Lindun Road, they accidentally crashed into the river while avoiding a stray dog in the road due to the front wheel being unstable. After the accident, nearby patrol police bravely jumped into the river to rescue them one by one. Unfortunately, Ji Kunyi had a hole in his left temple, with blood gushing out. Ji Shanchu was injured in the face and was not seriously injured, but his mind was still blurred due to severe internal shock. The deceased, Ji Kunyi, had an elderly mother and a beloved wife. After hearing the news, they rushed to the scene and wept loudly over the body, fainting one after another, which was unbearable to witness.

### 鄱湖水位低落

[Report from our newspaper, Poyang, 15th] Poyang Lake is the only reservoir in Jiangxi Province, and the rise and fall of its water level is related to shipping and transportation. Last year, the water source of Poyang Lake was not large. There was a severe drought for two months after autumn, coupled with a sudden drop in river water, and the lake water drained outward. The siltation around Longkou and Zhumushan was the most severe, making it difficult for civilian ships to navigate. In the counties along the lake, large quantities of local products were piled up and could not be transported smoothly. Porcelain from Jingdezhen and coal from Leping were mostly exported through the Jinqi Highway and dry road transport.

### Price Stabilization: Changzhou Relieves 20,000 Poor People

[Our Newspaper Wujin Fifteenth Dispatch] In order to maintain the livelihood of the poor in view of rising prices, the local authorities of this county specially invited representatives from various institutions to the county government and decided on a price stabilization plan. The beneficiaries of the price stabilization are based on the list of poor people from the Winter Relief Association, estimated to be more than 20,000 people, with a total rice volume of 3,000 shi. The price difference will be borne by the Chamber of Commerce with 300 million [currency unit], which must be paid off by the end of this month. The shortfall will be borne by the Grain Storage Committee. The source of grain for price stabilization will be supplied by the Grain Storage Association, purchased and sold as needed, and handled by the Grain Association. Price stabilization will be carried out in four phases, one phase every five days, with four sheng for large households and three sheng for small households per phase, handled in five locations: east, south, west, north, and center. The first phase will run from the tenth day of the twelfth lunar month to the twenty-fifth day. All procedures are being rushed through.

### Suzhou Legislative Yuan Election: Reaching the Stage of Close Quarters Combat

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Fifteenth Dispatch] The election campaign for the Legislative Yuan in Suzhou is becoming increasingly heated. The propaganda war of various candidates has already begun. Yan Xinqi, nominated by the Kuomintang, and Song Jicheng, nominated by the Min She Dang (Social Democratic Party), are competing most fiercely. Campaign slogans are colorful and plentiful in the streets. At night, wine shops and teahouses are brightly lit, and behind-the-scenes lobbying has reached the stage of close quarters combat. Mr. Yan is the current Speaker of the Senate and is usually enthusiastic about local public welfare, promoting it with all his might. He has great credibility among township Baojia (local security system) and also has the enthusiastic support of more than a hundred senators scattered throughout the townships, and is about to sweep the Suzhou votes. Mr. Song is a lawyer and a senior figure in the legal profession, with considerable potential in the old society. This time he is participating in the election, nominated by the gentry class, and he will also compete with all his might. Other candidates from outside Suzhou include Di Ying from Taicang, Wu Shaoshu from Songjiang, and Zhong Zhaoxiang from Wujiang, and many others. They are fighting each other fiercely, and the atmosphere of democracy is quite strong.

### Ripples of Paradise: Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe in Hangzhou

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Fifteenth Electric Dispatch] On January 10th, the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe was brought to Hangzhou by the West Lake No. 1 cruise ship and car. It was a cloudy afternoon, and the Hangzhou city station was packed with people. Although the railway police tried their best, they could not maintain order. When the car arrived, it was even more crowded. With great difficulty, a path was squeezed out to allow them to board the two most beautiful tour buses in Hangzhou, heading straight for the Xinxin Hotel in the inner West Lake.

Seven or Eight Days of Hospitality In the afternoon, they attended a welcome meeting from all walks of life and performed several programs. The next day, they braved the rain to visit Beishan. The third day they played on the lake and visited the Youth Association. The fourth day they climbed to the top of Yuhuang Mountain, went to the Liuhe Pagoda, the Qiantang River Bridge, and then to Zhijiang University, the "most excellent school environment" in the world. The fifth day they visited silk weaving factories, silk weaving scenery factories, and youth halls that they did not have there. The sixth day they visited the National Art College and National Zhejiang University, and the seventh day they visited the Air Force Officer School.

The Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe spent almost every day of their seven or eight days in Hangzhou with a tight schedule. There were three or four banquets from agencies and organizations every day, and one or two tea parties every day. People crowded everywhere to see them. Several performance nights broke the iron doors of the theaters and collapsed the emergency exits. People were packed inside to enjoy their dance skills. Forty Xinjiang children indeed infused the calm surface of West Lake with a primitive emotional excitement, causing ripples.

The Emergence of the Song and Dance Troupe The reporter spent seven or eight days with them, so I know them relatively clearly. They were organized by the Propaganda Committee of the Xinjiang Provincial Government. Originally, song and dance were extremely common in Xinjiang. Children who can run and jump at the age of five or six, and old people in their seventies and eighties, can all dance and sing. The emergence of this song and dance troupe was due to the selection of people who are relatively good at singing and dancing from various regions to participate. After a month of training in Dihua, they set off for Nanjing. Among this group of people, the most educated are graduates of normal schools, followed by middle schools, and then primary schools. In Xinjiang, there is a Xinjiang Academy, as well as provincial normal schools, provincial middle schools, and provincial girls' middle schools.

Reporters Participate Inside In the era of Sheng Shicai's rule in Xinjiang, schools had to study Russian. Now schools no longer read Russian, only Uyghur and Chinese. Uyghur is relatively similar to Turkish. There are three newspapers in the area: Xinjiang Daily, Freedom Daily, and Uyghur-Chinese Daily. Each of these newspapers sells only a few thousand copies. It is said that each newspaper originally sold more than 10,000 copies, but later the number of sales gradually declined due to traffic obstructions. There is also a publication called Altai Monthly, which also sells only a little over 1,000 copies. In this song and dance troupe, two are newspaper reporters, one is Mr. Haiber, the editor-in-chief of Altai Monthly, and the other is Ms. Palida, a reporter for Xinjiang Daily and Freedom Daily. However, they are not accompanying reporters, but members of the troupe, song and dance performers.

Don't Treat Xinjiang as an Outsider They hope we don't treat Xinjiang as an outsider. In the era of Sheng Shicai, it is said that Han people bullied Uyghurs. After Zhang Zhizhong's rule in Xinjiang, Han and Uyghur people are truly one family. They do not like ideologies without ethnicity or country. They love ethnicity and country. Due to their beliefs and the development of their good knowledge and abilities, it is believed that the Yili problem will be resolved.

A Glimpse of Xinjiang Customs There are no bananas, pears, or some fruits produced in the southeast on the streets of Xinjiang. There are particularly many melons there, which are sweet and fragrant. Most people wear wool, and silk is a precious fabric. When there are important guests, they use pilaf to entertain the guests, which is to cook fruits and rice together and grab it with their hands, unlike here where dishes are served one after another endlessly. Funerals involve wrapping the body in white cloth and burying it in the ground, without coffins.

This time, they came to the inland and received such a warm welcome from the people of the inland. They will return with incomparable joy to convey our good intentions. They are even more eager for our inland culture to have an exchange role with the frontier culture. They want us to see Xinjiang as closely related as lips and teeth, and to help them as much as possible.

Frontier Cultural Research Now, we have finally seen their culture: the rough and cheerful music, the simple and lively dance. Especially the flute, which leads the musical instruments, and the swaying neck in the dance, these are all our own culture, treasures inherited from our ancestors. How can we forget it? How can we not study and improve it, and seek something else from foreign pianos, foreign drums, thighs, and decadent sounds? Are we really old? No, the frontier culture is still very young. As long as we study and improve it, we will have a thriving and vigorous day.

During their seven or eight days in Hangzhou, they were warmly loved by the people of "Paradise," and they were also intoxicated by the environment of "Paradise." It is hoped that after they leave, they will bring back our enthusiasm and cultural relics, and leave behind their enthusiasm and performance spirit, so that we can brace ourselves and study and improve well to enrich our own national culture. (Our newspaper sent staff member Chu Yusheng)

### "Female Police Officer, Arrest, Permed Hair": Hangzhou Hairdressers Are Furious

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Fifteenth Dispatch] Hairdressers in this city have suddenly become furious after the "Fake Phoenix and False Phoenix Case." Recently, Zhejiang Provincial Radio Station inserted a humorous program "Female Police Officer Arrests Permed Hair," which was intended to encourage women to practice thrift. Hairdressers, after listening to it, all believed that it had a significant impact on their business. Therefore, they were all indignant and sent representatives to the Recreation Workers' Union to lodge a serious protest. After the union publicly apologized, the storm subsided. Hangzhou is experiencing a severe shortage of housing, and landlords are calculating rents based on goods and cost of living indexes. Poor civil servants cannot afford it and many are staying in office small hotels. Staff from various departments of the provincial government have initiated the formation of a tenant association to resist various illegal measures by landlords. More than 600 people have signed up, and a general meeting is scheduled to be held at the People's Education Center on the 18th. (Special correspondent Shao Yue)

### Economic Reform Plan (Complete): Draft Implementation Measures for the Transportation Sector

B. Dredging of Waterways

Major waterways directly connected to seaports shall be dredged by the central competent authority, and secondary waterways shall be dredged by the provincial, municipal, and county governments after being approved by the central government. For navigation needs, the Ministry of Transportation should divide the national inland waterways into several regions, such as the Xiang-E navigation line in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the Pearl River Delta area, etc. After the seaport construction plan has been approved, the competent authority shall carry out dredging matters.

C. Increasing the Tonnage of Privately Operated Shipping Vessels

Opening up shipping and encouraging private operation has always been the main policy of maritime administration. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, most of the private shipping companies destroyed by the enemy and puppets were assisted by the government. The following steps are formulated to encourage private operation:

Compensating for Losses of Requisitioned Vessels: In addition to the US$3.6 million approved by the Executive Yuan for compensation, a portion of the US ship purchase loan will be allocated to allow shipping companies to purchase vessels in the United States.

(Continued from yesterday's fifth edition)

The original loss of 120,000 tons of vessels is planned to be jointly operated by organized companies. The ship purchase loan will be repaid in ten years in the future.

Salvaging Sunken Vessels: Assisting shipping companies in salvaging enemy-sunken vessels, repairing and using them, in accordance with the measures for salvaging sunken vessels.

Assisting Loans: Negotiating loans with the Four Banks Joint Office to encourage shipping companies to build new vessels, the method of which will be formulated separately.

Rewarding Overseas Shipping Routes: If shipping companies have the strength to operate overseas shipping routes, they will be given as much assistance and rewards as possible.

Rewarding the Import of Shipbuilding Materials: The method of which will be formulated separately.

Original Plan (5)

Telegraphs are operated by the central government, and wireless stations for special needs in the sea and air, such as aviation and shipping, should be allowed to be set up independently under the management of the central government.

Implementation measures:

A. Active Establishment of Aviation and Maritime Wireless Stations

The independent establishment of aviation and maritime wireless stations should be supervised by the Ministry of Transportation in accordance with the "Aviation Wireless Station Establishment Rules" and the "Ship Wireless Station Regulations" to urge aircraft and ships to independently set up radio stations. In addition to aviation and maritime, various agencies have a large number of dedicated radio stations with chaotic wavelengths and many abuses, which should be gradually eliminated to comply with regulations. The Ministry of Transportation should strengthen the control of radio waves.

B. Strengthening the Implementation of Central Government Operated Telecommunications

To strengthen the implementation of central government-operated telecommunications, we should follow the telecommunications five-year construction plan formulated by the Ministry of Transportation in the 36th year [of the Republic of China, i.e. 1947]. The first two years will focus on restoring the pre-war status quo, and the last three years will gradually increase equipment to have a minimum preliminary communication network. Special attention should be paid to the acquisition of equipment and materials to achieve the purpose of strengthening state-owned telecommunications.

Original Plan (6)

Long-distance telephone trunk lines and inter-provincial rail lines are laid by the central government within each province, and branch lines are laid by the province, but they must not be parallel to trunk lines or inter-provincial lines (the division of trunk and branch lines is stipulated by the central government), and county and township branch lines are laid by the provincial government.

Implementation measures:

In accordance with this plan, the Ministry of Transportation stipulates that the lines along the coast, railways, national highways, provincial highways, and rivers where ships navigate shall be used as trunk lines, and the rest shall be used as branch lines. The Ministry of Transportation shall immediately plan and draw a trunk line distribution map and publish it. The laying method for provincial branch lines and city, county, and township lines will be formulated separately.

Original Plan (7)

For urban telephones, except for municipalities directly under the central government, which are operated by the central government or publicly, the remaining counties are encouraged to operate by the people, and methods are stipulated to allow them to connect with long-distance telephones. Implementation measures:

A. Operation of Urban Telephones

Regarding privately operated urban telephones, the Ministry of Transportation should support the normal development of private operation in accordance with the principles of the "Regulations on the Establishment and Elimination of Privately Operated Urban Telephones," and appropriately revise these regulations and handle them according to the actual situation.

B. Stipulating Methods for Connecting with Long-Distance Telephones

The connection between urban telephones and long-distance telephones is also stipulated in the above regulations, and a contract format for the connection of state-owned long-distance calls and privately operated city calls has been formulated, which will be signed by the telecommunications bureau and private companies at any time, and still be handled by the competent department in accordance with the announced rules.

Original Plan (8)

The government should do its best to supervise and assist the construction of various transportation projects and the manufacturing of transportation vehicles.

Implementation measures:

A. Supervision and Assistance in the Construction of Various Transportation Projects

Regarding the supervision and assistance in the construction of various transportation projects, in addition to strengthening the implementation of various state-owned enterprises, the supervision and assistance of public and private enterprises shall be gradually handled in accordance with the above implementation measures.

B. Supervision and Assistance in the Manufacturing of Transportation Vehicles

We should do our best to encourage people to manufacture various transportation vehicles, provide various manufacturing and inspection standards, and provide technical assistance. The qualified products should be purchased as much as possible by various state-owned transportation agencies. The government should improve the industrial environment, protect industrial profits, and at the same time ensure that funds have sources and loans are convenient. In the initial stage of implementation, we should relax the import quota of raw materials and supply foreign exchange. Other measures such as stabilizing prices and wages should also be actively promoted to seek the development of private enterprises.

According to reports: "At 11:40 a.m. on the 10th of this month, the 61st train arrived in He [Jiaxing]. Chen Hourong, the captain of the Qing Middle School team, did not obey the order and exited the station from the entrance. The road police interfered and were insulted and beaten. Because the road police resisted, Chen's nose was accidentally injured. After Chen returned to school, a Qing Middle School official came to the police substation to negotiate, making many conditions and changing them repeatedly until the next day. At 7:50 p.m. on the 11th, more than 100 Qing Middle School students poured into the Mingxing Grand Theater, searching for road police but failing to find them. However, a traffic police technician was mistakenly beaten because his uniform was similar to that of the road police. When they realized they had made a mistake, they became even more angry. That night at 8:50 p.m., they gathered three to four hundred people and surrounded the station in three routes. Zhu Shenggao and two other police officers on duty were tied up, and Inspector Deng Gongrui and three other police officers were beaten and injured. The police substation office was also destroyed. At that time, there were gunshots. In the dormitory, the road police heard the alarm and fired six shots. Later, Qing Middle School officials and the police substation chief arrived and stopped them.

### Public and Private Colleges and Universities in Shanghai Protest the Kowloon Walled City Incident, Issue Joint Declaration, and Propose Five Demands

[Our Newspaper News] More than 30 presidents of public and private colleges and universities in Shanghai, including Zhang Yi, Zhu Jingnong, Ou Yuan, and Ling Xian, attended the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee the other day to discuss the issue of the British Hong Kong government forcibly demolishing the residences of Chinese residents in Kowloon Walled City. It was decided to entrust Zhu Jingnong and six others to draft a joint declaration in the name of the "Shanghai College and University Association." The full text of the declaration is recorded as follows: Recently, the British Hong Kong government forcibly demolished the houses of our Chinese residents in Kowloon Walled City, shot and injured many innocent residents, causing bloody incidents, and illegally arrested resident representatives and sentenced them to penal servitude. This kind of behavior that despises our national sovereignty and goes against humanity makes us unable to refrain from making a serious statement.

The "Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory," signed on June 9, 1898, stipulated: "All Chinese officials now stationed in Kowloon City shall continue to exercise jurisdiction there, and it is further agreed that the district of Kowloon City and its vicinity shall be reserved as a place of resort for the convenience of Chinese men-of-war, merchant vessels and junks, and for the free passage of the inhabitants of the city and its neighbourhood." It can be seen that the Chinese government still retains sovereignty over Kowloon Walled City and its nearby docks and sea areas. Now the Hong Kong government is illegally forcing the demolition of the houses of Chinese residents in the territory under our country's jurisdiction, which is an aggressive act that destroys our national sovereignty.

Recently, the British government has gradually adopted a moderate policy towards the rule of colonies, such as allowing the independence of India and Myanmar. This is indeed a gratifying thing in the eyes of the Chinese people. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong government is still executing the aggressive policies of the past imperialist rights, which is infinitely regrettable and indignant. China and Britain were allies during the war. Our army fought side by side with the British army on the battlefields of India and Myanmar, and the friendship was excellent. Now that the war has ended not long ago, the British government is treating its previous loyal allies in this way, which is contrary to the way of making friends. Leaving aside the above points, we have always known that Britain has always respected personal freedom, property, and life. Now, it has forcibly demolished the houses of Chinese residents, causing countless people to be displaced, and opened fire on the unarmed old, weak, women, and children, causing serious injuries to many people, creating a bloody incident. This is indeed a cruel act that goes against humanity.

### Compensation for All Losses, Strict Punishment of Responsible Personnel

We are all people who serve in the education sector. We cannot but protest seriously against the Hong Kong government's actions that infringe on Chinese sovereignty and violate humanitarianism. We cherish Britain's friendship with China, and we sincerely hope that British people will not easily damage this friendship. It must be known that maintaining the independence and integrity of Chinese sovereignty is the responsibility and obligation of every Chinese person. Regardless of political views or religious beliefs, the entire country is united in this determination. The British government must not disregard the unanimous will of our people to safeguard sovereignty simply because China is currently in internal turmoil. In addition to urging and waiting for the government to lodge a serious protest and negotiation, we hereby make the following demands on the British government: Compensate all losses of the residents in Kowloon Walled City. Immediately release the illegally arrested residents. Strictly punish the personnel responsible for this incident. Apologize to the Chinese government and people. Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

### Return Kowloon First to Eradicate Unfortunate Events

Moreover, we have to say that the occurrence of this unfortunate incident was entirely caused by the dispute over the sovereignty of Kowloon Walled City. In order to eliminate the source of future disputes and promote friendly relations between China and Britain, we advocate that the British government should immediately return the leased territory of Kowloon. The establishment of leased territories was originally due to the weakness of the Qing government at the end of the 19th century, when various imperialist countries forcibly signed leases, and sovereignty still belonged to China. Now that our country is an independent and sovereign country, the leased territories of Jiaozhou and Guangzhou Bay have been recovered one after another, and Britain should also return the leased territory of Kowloon as soon as possible to eradicate the occurrence of unfortunate events in the future. As for Hong Kong, although it belongs to Britain, it is closely connected to southern China and has close and inseparable political, economic, and military ties with China. The British government should also hold negotiations with our government as soon as possible to return it to our country as soon as possible. In this way, not only will similar bloody incidents in Kowloon Walled City not happen again, but the relationship between China and Britain will also become closer. This is the declaration.

### University Representatives Protest to British Consulate and Petition the Chairman

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai University Student Groups United Association Protesting the Kowloon Incident yesterday issued a letter to the people of the whole country. At 3 p.m., nine representatives were sent to the British Consulate in Shanghai to present a letter of protest. Deputy Consul Zhi Leide received them. The protest letter pointed out the errors in the British government's diplomacy and put forward a number of oral protests and demands: Confirm that Hong Kong and Kowloon belong to China. The Chinese government should take back Hong Kong and Kowloon, and the British government should unconditionally cede them. Please the British government adopt diplomatic means to resolve the Hong Kong and Kowloon incident and immediately stop the brutal actions. Compensate the losses of the compatriots in Kowloon. Immediately release the two resident representatives. Please forward to the British government a satisfactory reply within one week; otherwise, they will respond to the current crisis with the spirit of the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan. The British government should not take advantage of the situation to attack, which is unjust. Zhi replied that the opinions of the Chinese people on the Kowloon incident should be conveyed to the British government by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was not clear about the truth of the incident and could not answer. After the representatives withdrew, they went to the Municipal Government at 4:30 p.m. and presented a letter to Mayor Wu and a letter to Chairman Chiang, asking Mayor Wu to forward the petition.

### A Message to the People of the Entire Nation

Now, the Shanghai University student groups' joint announcement protesting the Kowloon Incident, a message to the people of the entire nation, the original text is recorded below: "Thanks to the government's firm leadership and the people's sacrifices and struggles, the war of resistance defeated the stubborn enemy, abolishing unequal treaties. However, due to the Communist bandits' two years of rebellion, inviting wolves into the house, burning, killing, looting, destroying sovereignty and territorial integrity, and persecuting and damaging the people's lives, the international status of the four powers has declined daily. The new foreigners' contempt and exploitation of us, the old humiliation has returned. Hong Kong and Kowloon, territories that should have been recovered by our country, the British government stubbornly occupies and refuses to relinquish. The Hong Kong government even puts on the face of old imperialism. It has already caused the Ping Shan Airport Incident, and now forcefully demolishes Chinese people's residences in Chinese territory, arresting residents' representatives, which is barbarous and unreasonable. When our countrymen hear of it, they are filled with righteous indignation and resentment. The students of Shanghai universities are even more uneasy because the nation's dignity has been violated and their compatriots have been trampled upon. Therefore, they urge Chairman Chiang to strengthen the suppression of the rebellion and national reconstruction, strengthen national defense capabilities, adopt strong diplomacy, and use force to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon. For all the losses suffered by our people in this Kowloon incident, we demand that the British government compensate immediately. We, the youth of the whole country, pledge to fight again at all costs to be the government's backing. At the same time, we issue a message to the people of the whole country, hoping that they will jointly demand that the government strengthen the suppression of the rebellion and national reconstruction, implement strong diplomacy, and immediately do everything possible to donate funds to comfort the residents of Kowloon. Compatriots, warlord separatism led to the invasion of Japanese pirates, and the Communist bandits' rebellion has caused a series of unfortunate events that have humiliated the nation and ceded territory, such as the Northeast, Northwest, and Kowloon. We must overthrow the Communist bandits in the same way that we overthrew the warlords in order to solve all external unfortunate events. We must have independent and autonomous strong diplomacy in order to protect our compatriots and combat the wild flames of all red and white imperialists."

### World Games Football Pre-selection - Rong Qizhao Reports - Selection Criteria - And Issues Important Statement

[This newspaper report] Dr. Rong Qizhao, Chairman of the Football Committee of the Shanghai Sports Association, held a reception for the sports news media in this city at the Kang Le Restaurant at 4:00 PM yesterday to report on the work of the Football Committee this year, and to discuss the recent trip to Hong Kong to negotiate inter-port competitions and World Games selection. Le Xiurong, Peng Wenyu, Yu Hengzhi, Shen Huichun, Lu Xiangqian, Shen Peiji, and more than 30 reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers attended. Rong's report is recorded as follows:

### Football Committee's Work This Year

The work of the Football Committee this year is: The league was changed to a single round-robin system due to the later start. The rest of the groups remain the same. Cup competitions: Registration for the Mayor's Cup has begun, and the Junior Cup is already underway. Entrusted by the National Sports Association of China to prepare for the World Games pre-selection in the Shanghai area. Preparing to hold the Shanghai-Hong Kong Inter-Port Competition, to be held in Hong Kong on the Lunar New Year's Day.

### World Games Pre-selection - Resolution of the Sports Association

The National Sports Association of China, in order to prepare for the organization of a Chinese World Games football team, resolved at a plenary meeting of directors and supervisors last year: To hire Rong Qizhao, Zhou Jiaqi, Yu Hengzhi, Huang Jiajun, and Li Huitang as selection committee members, with myself as the chairman. In order to facilitate the participation of teams from Chinese compatriots in Singapore, the Philippines, Java, and Saigon in Southeast Asia in the pre-selection, and due to climate conditions, it was decided to hold pre-selections in two regions: Hong Kong and Shanghai. North China, Central China, West China, and East China will participate in the Shanghai region. The National Sports Association has financial difficulties, so it must hold competitions along the way when the football team goes abroad to participate in the meeting, and use ticket revenue to subsidize travel expenses. Therefore, the football team will go abroad early, so the pre-selection must be held in advance. Although the National Games are scheduled to be held on May 5, the Sports Association must prepare for any eventuality. The route of the football team out of the country is tentatively set to pass through the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and South America to reach the United Kingdom.

### Mission to Hong Kong - Negotiation Process

My mission to Hong Kong and the negotiation process: In the capacity of Chairman of the Football Committee of the Shanghai Sports Association, I contacted the Hong Kong Football Association on matters related to the inter-port competition, accepted the Hong Kong side's opinions, and agreed that the Shanghai team would go to Hong Kong on the Lunar New Year's Day, and restore the previous method of hosting the home and away teams, that is, the home team is responsible for hosting, the visiting team raises its own travel expenses, and the ticket sharing system is cancelled, in order to conform to the purpose of the inter-port competition to connect friendship. In the capacity of Chairman of the World Games Football Representative Selection Committee of the National Sports Association, I consulted with Hong Kong committee members Huang Jiajun and Li Huitang on the World Games selection criteria.

### Football Representative - Selection Criteria

The following selection criteria for football representatives were agreed upon: Those who have sportsmanship and obedience, and are sufficient to represent the country, Those who are young and strong, strive for progress, and can lead those who come later after returning to the country, Excellent skills.

### Hong Kong Side - Caused Misunderstanding

The misunderstanding caused by my trip to Hong Kong was that I did not visit the heads of various football clubs and the Chinese Football Federation. The reason for this is that my qualifications and mission for going to Hong Kong have been described above. Since it has nothing to do with the football clubs, there is no need to visit them. The National Sports Association has directly sent a letter to the Hong Kong branch to report on the pre-selection matters, and since I am not a representative of the association, I have no opportunity to intervene. The Hong Kong Chinese Football Federation is also not directly affiliated with the National Sports Association of China. Furthermore, I should correct the suspicion that my conversation with reporters involved attacking individuals. I handle sports affairs purely out of interest, and have absolutely no ambition, let alone any conflict of interest with any individual. The reporter from the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily newspaper asked me, and I only answered the news published with my personal opinion. As for the issue of Mr. Hu Jun of Hong Kong and Macau being superior, it is purely intentional rumor-mongering. I have never met Mr. Hu. Participating in the World Games is a matter of national prestige, and should be understood and supported by all parties. I hope that my comrades in the news media will provide more guidance and criticism.

### World Games Selection

I handle affairs without prejudice, especially to ask for any detailed criticism in order to improve. I am very grateful for the article published in the Southeast Daily a few days ago, offering me a word of advice. The following is a summary of my reply: Sports are civilianized in the past, so it is now, and so it will be in the future. The National Games have been decided to be held, and the World Games pre-selection is a preparation for any eventuality. The football team must go abroad early due to travel expenses. The selection of World Games representatives is based on individual skills, not on the entire champion team. It is difficult for Central China and West China to participate in the pre-selection. The selection committee has already taken this into consideration. There are very few football talents in the above-mentioned regions, so it is also possible for one or two people to come to Shanghai to participate. Regarding the cooperation and venue issues for the Hong Kong pre-selection, Hong Kong Football Association Chairman Shi Gen has agreed to assist. If the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong can put the nation first and eliminate personal opinions, they will naturally fully support it.

### Bank of Communications Sports Group - Celebration Party Tonight

The bank has scheduled to hold a celebration party at 6:00 PM today at the Four Banks Building, 261 Xichuan Road, 8th floor. There will definitely be a grand occasion at that time, and sports news reporters will be invited,

### Basketball League Tonight - Hualian Meets Shantou Team

In addition to 10,000 yuan for upstairs tickets and 20,000 yuan for downstairs tickets, numbered seats inside the wire mesh are still sold for 50,000 yuan, and sales will start at 4:30 PM. The order of the stadium will still be maintained by the Siwei Boy Scouts. Today's schedule is as follows:

Qianghua vs. Qingqiu (Women's Group) 5:30 PM Xi Qing Lü vs. Yang Hang (A2B) 6:30 PM

Hualian vs. Shantou Team (A1 Group) 7:30 PM In the women's group, Qianghua vs. Qingqiu, Qingqiu is composed of students from Minli, and is not different from the Xuebai Sisters Team. It is difficult to predict the outcome when they meet Qianghua today.

In the A1 group, Hualian vs. Shantou Team is the most exciting scene today. Hualian is the leader at sea, and Shantou is only a little bit behind. When the two teams meet again today, Shantou should increase its efforts.

### To Prevent Price Fluctuations During the Lunar New Year - The Authorities are Tightening the Money Supply - The Gold Control Bureau Conducts Emergency Inspections of Banks and Firms

The money supply has been very tight for days. Yesterday morning, it was generally tight, and the tightness eased slightly in the afternoon. Yesterday, a total of 11,490 checks were exchanged. The Four Banks and Two Bureaus also advanced 344 billion yuan, and the total amount of exchanged checks was 4,064,916,047,000 yuan. As the Lunar New Year is approaching, all parties are busy raising funds, and it is expected that the money supply will continue to be tight.

According to sources, in order to prevent price increases before and after the Lunar New Year, the financial authorities have decided to cooperate with various economic departments to tighten the money supply, continue to sell large quantities of goods, and strengthen the absorption of floating capital to prevent market fluctuations.

[This newspaper report] In order to prevent price fluctuations during the Lunar New Year, the Gold Control Bureau will implement emergency inspections of various banks and firms in the near future and is planning methods. The Bureau's original general survey will also be launched. Previously, to facilitate the survey and clarify the actual situation of various banks, firms, insurance, and trust companies, a financial institution survey form was specially prepared and distributed to various units for completion. As of now, 50 commercial banks, 52 money houses, 6 foreign banks, 2 credit cooperatives, 1 provincial bank, and 4 trust companies have submitted the completed forms.

According to the person in charge of the Bureau, the above-mentioned emergency inspection is temporary, fearing that various banks and companies will engage in illegal activities during the Lunar New Year and stimulate prices. The general survey is fixed and will be conducted at least once a month to audit the use of remittances and loans, and will be carried out in batches by region.

Another dispatch: According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, the Bureau's inspection of bank and firm operations is divided into four categories for the sake of strictness and prudence.

### Revision of the Unified Accounting System - Adding the "Loan on Behalf" Subject

It is learned that the unified accounting system has been revised. The asset class has added the "Loan on Behalf" subject, and the liability class has changed the subject to "Entrusted Loan on Behalf," which is revised based on the opinions of the Shanghai Banking Association.

According to the Shanghai Banking Association's request to the Ministry of Finance last year to revise the unified accounting system, it is proposed to change the liability class 70 "Loan on Behalf" subject in the original system's Chapter II, Article 24 to the "Entrusted Loan on Behalf" subject. Its explanation: "All funds entrusted by colleagues to be released on behalf due to contractual relationship belong to this."

In Chapter II, Article 23 of the asset class, add the "Loan on Behalf" subject. Its explanation: "All funds released on behalf entrusted by colleagues due to contractual relationship belong to this." The Ministry of Finance directly requested the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to verify it. According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics' reply, since the above-mentioned addition and amendment of the subject is a factual need and does not violate accounting principles, it can be agreed to. The Ministry of Finance instructed the Shanghai Banking Association to inform it and pass it on to all members of the association to comply with.

### Government Bonds Weak - Foreign Stocks Mediocre

The asking price rebounded in the afternoon, and finally leveled with the market price of the previous day. A box of Guang, 120 Xuzi, was still traded for 90 million yuan at the opening in the morning, and then immediately dropped to 87.55 million yuan, and then further dropped to 4 million yuan, and there was no shortage of people absorbing at low prices. The closing price rebounded to 8.5 million yuan. The final price in the afternoon was 91 million yuan. Tianqiao, Dongyang, etc. also rose and fell accordingly.

Factory Finished Goods

The market fell yesterday. It was also because those who traded in special goods needed funds, resulting in a transaction price that was 6-7 million yuan less than the asking price of the previous day. The opening price for D-grade was 95 million yuan. There were transactions for Gao Lingdan at 4 million yuan and 5 million yuan. All goods were paid for with deferred-date tickets.

The market recovered slightly in the afternoon, and the opening price for goods was 40 million yuan outside the customs. The rest of the goods were slightly weak.

Spot Cotton Falls

The spot cotton market was still quiet yesterday. The industry was in a hurry to close the year. The money supply was tight. Moreover, the fabric market continued to be weak, and people's minds were softening. The opening prices for the textile industry were even lower. The market was soft again. Each grade fell by about 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 514 bales were traded.

### Continued Decline in Cotton Yarn and Cloth; 42-count Blue Phoenix Down 2 Million Compared to Previous Day

Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened with a morning decline due to the impact of tight monetary conditions. Operators facing financial pressure reluctantly liquidated their positions, leading to a soft market sentiment. Numerous floating orders were resold, with most transactions being arbitrage-driven, resulting in a sluggish and spiritless market with a declining trend.

Ultimately, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn experienced a sharp drop of 2 million yuan compared to the previous day, settling at 58.3 million yuan. Other counts of both coarse and fine yarn also saw price reductions ranging from 700,000 to 1.2 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market opened with a weak sentiment, and trading was sluggish. Prices were initially quoted lower across the board. However, the market slightly recovered as Ningbo and Shaoxing merchants showed interest in purchasing unbleached drill, and some merchants from the Yangtze River region also made limited acquisitions.

Towards the close of trading, some operators, constrained by tight monetary conditions, continued to sell off their holdings. Buyers became less active as the year-end approached, and the market ultimately experienced a decline.

As a result, 12-pound fine cloth across all grades continued to fall by 20,000 to 35,000 yuan. Throughout the day, only bleached cloth, dyed cloth, and shirting maintained their firmness, while other cloth types showed mixed performance, ranging from flat to weak.

Spinning and Weaving Company Sells Yarn

[Report from this newspaper] The China Spinning and Weaving Company sold yarn yesterday as usual, totaling 271 pieces, equivalent to 443.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were 122 subscribers, and the selling price remained unchanged.

### Cotton Merchants Continue to Report Cotton Inventory; Approaching 50,000 Market Loads

[Report from this newspaper] Since the establishment of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, various departments have intensified their work. Regarding cotton registration, as of the 15th of this month, cotton merchants in this city have continued to report cotton inventory, totaling 47,059 market loads. The committee has already notified the China Spinning and Weaving Company to continue purchasing it.

Furthermore, cotton mills in this city have reported a total cotton inventory of 617,201 market loads. Cotton mills in other provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui) have reported a total cotton inventory of 311,713 market loads.

Tea Market Turns Promising

After the owners released stocks of black and green tea, the situation temporarily stabilized. Yesterday, sellers, realizing the market had limited supply, began to hold onto their goods in anticipation of higher prices, resulting in a gradually improving market sentiment. Prices for various grades of tea rose sharply. However, export tea remained sluggish due to the cautious approach of exporters. As for domestic tea, local merchants and buyers continued to seek supplies, and transaction volumes remained reasonably good.

### Soap Industry Association Meeting

Request to Ban Imports of Industrial Soap [Report from this newspaper] The Fourth District Soap Industry Association held a meeting yesterday to discuss appealing to the authorities to ban imports of industrial soap. It was decided that the chairman of the association, Liang Songling, would meet with the newly appointed Chairman Huo Baoshu of the Import and Export Management Committee today to discuss the matter in detail before determining the association's position.

Furthermore, the association noted that the Finance Bureau recently announced a reduction of half the business tax for industries related to national defense and people's livelihoods. However, soap products, which are essential for daily life, were not included in the tax reduction. Therefore, the association will also attempt to submit separate appeals to relevant parties.

Guben Factory to Distribute Goods [Report from this newspaper] Amid rising soap prices, it is reported that the Guben factory is about to begin distributing goods to alleviate supply and demand issues. The intended distribution volume for Guben brand daily-use soap is reportedly set at 1.8 million. The market for daily-use soap saw significant sales yesterday due to high interest rates in the black market, leading to numerous holders releasing their stocks and lowering quoted prices. As a result, Jian brand and Ben brand soaps saw a sharp drop of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, while other brands fell by 20,000 to 50,000 yuan. Matches also declined by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while kerosene remained stable.

Cigarettes Decline

Yesterday's cigarette market saw sluggish activity due to tight credit conditions. Bearish sentiment prevailed in the market, with continuous selling pressure from multiple sellers. As a result, ten packs of Old Knife brand cigarettes from British American Tobacco continued to fall by 300,000 to 450,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Prices for all other Chinese and foreign cigarettes declined across the board, ranging from 1,000 to over 10,000 yuan.

### Woolen Fabrics Sales Sluggish

The standard prices for woolen fabrics remained firm, with both official and unofficial rates increasing. Dealers followed the lead of factories and remained optimistic. However, actual sales were slow across various regions and among different merchants, occurring earlier than in previous years. Recently, a piece of new Melton robe fabric costs approximately 3 million yuan, while slightly more presentable flannel for long gowns costs over 4 million yuan. A tailored suit averages 6 to 7 million yuan, and melton riding breeches and long-haired wool overcoats for women are priced around 6 million yuan, beyond the reach of ordinary people.

### High Costs of Tung Oil and Bristles; Exports Still Not Active

Domestic prices of tung oil and bristles have recently risen due to the general increase in prices, leading to higher costs and making exports more difficult. The price of tung oil is 1.66 million yuan per market load in Chongqing, 2.27 million yuan in Hankou, 2.8 million yuan in Shanghai, 2.3 million yuan in Changsha, 1.82 million yuan in Wanxian, 2.28 million yuan in Wuzhou, and 2.666 million yuan in Guangzhou.

Due to weak year-end sales, the overseas selling price is US$0.2625 per pound for spot goods in New York, US$0.2525 per pound C&F for electricity price in Hong Kong, and £186 per ton OFF for barrelled oil in London.

After the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement, tung oil smuggling to Hong Kong will inevitably decrease. However, goods already in Hong Kong and registered with the Hong Kong government are exempt from providing foreign exchange settlement certificates, so prices in Hong Kong are unlikely to rebound in the short term.

The price of bristles is 28 million yuan per customs load for Chongqing bristles. Washed and dressed grade 17 bristles from Hankou are quoted at 40 million yuan, but no transactions have occurred. Shanghai bristles are 28 million yuan.

Overseas market prices are US$8 per pound C&F New York for Tianjin grade 55 and US$6 for small grade 55, both seller's offers with no transactions. Chongqing grade 27, paired in boxes, is US$2.2 per pound C&F, with some small transactions occurring. London prices are CFF 14 shillings and 6 pence. Hankou and C&F New York bristles are US$3.25, and Shanghai bristles are US$2.25, all remaining firm. However, due to rising domestic costs along with general price increases, exports have not been active.

### Japanese Cement Arrives in Hong Kong; Cement Association Asks for Strict Prevention of Smuggling

[Report from this newspaper] According to reliable information obtained by the National Cement Association, a large batch of over 14,000 bags of Japanese cement has recently arrived in Hong Kong, and more will continue to arrive. The association believes that Hong Kong's construction needs are very limited, and domestic cement brands such as Taishan, Xiang, and Wuyang already have ample supply. The ultimate destination of this batch of cement will undoubtedly be smuggling to various locations for sale. At a time when domestic cement supply exceeds demand and sales are extremely sluggish, the association is paying close attention to the movement of Japanese cement arriving in Hong Kong. It has telegraphed the Customs Administration and other responsible authorities, instructing customs offices along the coast to strictly prevent its smuggling into the country to prevent future problems.

Literature and History

### Essays and Language

— Zhou Zumo

Language and literature are both tools for expressing thoughts, but they are not exactly the same. Language uses many sounds to express thoughts, while essays use writing to replace language, so they are different. When we speak, we can have different tones and pitches in our voices and words, and we can also express emotions and gestures to help others understand. These are not all completely expressible in essays. Therefore, Lu Ji's "Wen Fu" says, "I am always worried that the intention does not match the object, and the words do not express the intention." This is exactly the point. At the same time, on the receiver's side, essays are not as direct as language. The purpose of the essay, the truthfulness of the words, and the tone all need to be discerned and savored by the reader from the words, which inevitably adds another layer. Therefore, the effectiveness of essays is not necessarily the same as that of language.

However, although essays are different from language, they can never be separated from language and exist independently. It is putting the cart before the horse to discuss essays without language. Essays represent language, and language is the source of essays. Words and structures are all secondary matters. Looking at the essays of ancient people, the most brilliant ones are like speaking. All essays that are like speaking are also the most vivid. Even the dull narrative historical texts become more lively and engaging when dialogue is inserted. For example, Sima Qian often used this method in his writing of the "Records of the Grand Historian". In the "Biography of Lord Xinling" (Volume 77), almost half of the content is dialogue, which makes it extremely brilliant. There are also many direct records of spoken language. For example, in the "Biography of Zhou Chang" (Volume 96), when Zhou Chang advised Emperor Gao not to abolish the crown prince, it is said:

The Emperor wanted to abolish the crown prince and make Concubine Qi's son, Ruyi, the crown prince. The ministers strongly opposed it, but they could not prevail. Zhou Chang strongly argued in court. The Emperor asked him why. Chang stuttered and was very angry, saying, "I cannot speak well, but I know that it is impossible. Even if Your Majesty wants to abolish the crown prince, I will not obey the order." The Emperor smiled happily.

This vividly captures Zhou Chang's stuttering and repeating words. Also, the writings of Ru Lu in the Later Han Dynasty also have many parts that are simple and approachable. For example, in the "Biography of Fan Pang" (Volume 57), Wang Fu's interrogation of Fan Pang after he was imprisoned is written as follows:

As a subject, you do not show loyalty to the country, but instead create factions, praising each other and criticizing the court, fabricating groundless accusations. What do you want to do with all your conspiracies? Answer truthfully, and do not hide anything!

Although this is in four-character lines, it is all spoken language, and the scene of Wang Fu's sternness is fully expressed. From this, it can be seen that to make writing lively and smooth, one must pay attention to actual language.

Conversely, when we read the essays in the "New Book of Tang," we always feel that there are too many places where the writing is not smooth. Therefore, Wang Ruoxu's "Hunan Relics Collection" contains "Critiques of the New Book of Tang" (Volumes 22 to 24), which specifically attacks its shortcomings. For example, the "Biography of Linghu Defen" in the "Old Book of Tang" says:

Emperor Gaozong often summoned the chancellors and scholars of the Hongwen Pavilion and asked, "How does one cultivate to become a king? How does one cultivate to become a hegemon? Which comes first?" Defen replied, "If you want to implement them, the way of the king is the best, but it is difficult to implement." Emperor Gaozong said, "What is the most important policy to implement now?" But the "New Book of Tang" changed it to:

The Emperor asked, "How does one cultivate to become a king? How does one cultivate to become a hegemon? Which often comes first?" He replied, "If you use them, the way of the king comes first, but it is the most difficult." The Emperor said, "What is the most important thing to do now?"

Comparing the two, it is natural to see how strange and obscure Song Qi's writing is, and how it does not conform to grammar. This is exactly the opposite of what was mentioned earlier, and it is the problem of essays being divorced from language.

Today's writing styles are divided into classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese. Some people still think that writing in classical Chinese has its own grammar, which is different from the colloquial vernacular. Essays must be elegant to be considered good. But this is only one side of the view. If we recognize that essays should be close to language, we will naturally find that ancient essays, except for the difference in function words and vocabulary and the sounds of modern language, still use the grammar of speaking in terms of syntax. It is a mistake to discuss grammar without language. Because the habitual usage in language is grammar. It is in line with grammar to use language. The current language has been passed down from the Qin Dynasty, and although the pronunciation is different from ancient times, the arrangement of words in the language (i.e., Syntax) has not changed much. In ancient times, writing tools were difficult to use, so the sentences were concise and difficult to understand, such as the Book of Documents and some of the bronze inscriptions, which are not as clear and easy to understand as later sentences. This is inevitable and can be ignored. However, the articles after the Spring and Autumn Period were much clearer. For example, the "Analects" is more than two thousand years old, but it is still readable today because it is based on the Lu language of that time. Not only are the word order the same, but even the auxiliary words in the language are written out one by one, almost like speaking. This shows that essays must be attached to language in order to be

However, the styles of writing have changed greatly over the dynasties. Some people like to take the law from above and learn the articles of the Han and Wei dynasties, which is not wrong; however, they must be selective. There are many difficult articles by the Han people, but there are also shallow ones. The main purpose of the article is to convey meaning, and there is no need to be difficult. For example, the imperial edict recorded in the "Book of Han·Emperor Wen Ji" says:

The way to govern the people lies in focusing on agriculture. I have personally led the farmers of the world for ten years, but the fields have not been expanded. If the year is not good, the people will be hungry. This is because there are few happy events and the officials have not worked hard enough. I have issued decrees several times, urging the people to plant trees every year, but the work has not been done well. This is because the officials do not diligently follow my decrees and do not clearly persuade the people. Moreover, our farmers are very bitter, but the officials do not care about them. How can they be encouraged? Half of this year's rent and taxes will be given to the farmers.

Also, the "Treatise on Criminal Law" records Emperor Wen's edict abolishing corporal punishment: I have heard that in the time of Yu, people were punished by drawing clothes and wearing different clothes and ornaments, but the people did not commit crimes. What a great governance it was! Now there are three corporal punishments in the law, but adultery does not stop. Where is the blame? Is it not because of my thin virtue and unclear teaching? I am very ashamed. Therefore, the training is not pure, and the foolish people are trapped. The poem says: "Kind gentlemen, parents of the people." Now people have committed crimes, but education has not been implemented and punishment has already been added. Or they want to change their behavior for the better, but there is no way to go. I feel very sorry for them. Corporal punishment to cut off limbs, carve muscles and skin, and never stop for a lifetime. How painful is this punishment and how unkind is it? How can it be called "parents of the people"! Abolish corporal punishment and replace it with something else.

These are all first-class clear and straightforward texts. Therefore, Liu Xizai said in the "Yigai," "The most unattainable of Western Han texts is Emperor Wen's edict. The Book of Zhou's "Lv Xing" is considered by commentators to be sad and compassionate, and the meaning of the loyalty and kindness of the three dynasties can still be imagined. However, they only reached the form, not the essence. How can it be compared to Emperor Wen's emotions that reached the essence and created the text?" However, what Liu said, "Emotions reach the essence and create the text" means that the words are all true, pouring out the heart, and the resulting sentence is language, so it is naturally beautiful. The ancients said, "Cultivate the words and establish its sincerity," and also said, "Words convey the meaning." This is what they meant.

However, after the Qi and Liang dynasties, parallel prose became popular, which was a major change in the style of writing. However, famous writers still paid attention to the fluency of the writing in addition to paying attention to the rhythm and style. Down to the Sui and Tang dynasties, those who wrote parallel prose abused the idioms of the ancients and widely cited stories to show their erudition. As a result, the essay was separated from the language. Not only was the narrative unclear, but it was also lifeless. Therefore, until Han Yu advocated the revival movement, he removed the accumulated habits. The so-called "revival" is to restore the ancient way of writing essays, not to copy the words of the ancients, but to imitate their appearance. This made the essay embark on a clear and smooth path. Han Yu replied to Li Yi in his "Essay on Essays":

Qi is water, and words are floating objects. When the water is large, the floating objects, large and small, will float. The relationship between qi and words is the same. When the qi is strong, the length and sound of the words will be appropriate.

The "qi" he said is the "qi" of "righteous and strong." "Words" are the "words" of "what you want to say" in your heart. The utterance of language is all created by the breath, that is, "qi" carries "words". Moreover, everyone has a consistent tone when speaking. When the tone is strong, the words are also strong. When the tone is smooth, the words are also smooth. Then it is obvious that writing must correspond to the tone. In the past, ancient essayists knew this in their hearts, but they never made it clear. The ancient essayists of the Song Dynasty, such as Ouyang Xiu and Su Shi, were indeed masters, and they were also cultivated gradually. Their skills were so deep that they could "be slow and complete, repeating hundreds of times, but the passages were clear and smooth without interruption." They could "be leisurely and easy, without difficulty and hard work" (see Su Xun's "Letter to Ouyang Neihan"). But it was also because they had read Han Yu's articles for a long time that they realized the relationship between essays and language.

I do not intend to praise the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties here. In fact, the Eight Great Masters are enough to represent those who can write essays according to the consistent method of "text" and "words" of the ancients. Therefore, from Mao Lumen and Tang Jingchuan of the late Ming Dynasty to the essayists of the Tongcheng School of the Qing Dynasty, they all attached great importance to the Eight Great Masters, which was not without reason. As for Li Mengyang's revival in the Ming Dynasty, his writing was like felling wood and viewing stones, only for later generations to laugh at. In the past, Mr. Zhang Taiyan liked to imitate the texts of the Qin and Han Dynasties and before in his early years. His articles were full of ancient characters and the language was concise and obscure. However, in his later years, he still believed that beginners should start with the Eight Great Masters. Moreover, his own works, such as the articles collected in the "Supplement to the Zhang's Series," have also changed from the old to the simple and elegant. This shows that Mr. Zhang fully understood and discerned the right path of military writers from experience, which is in line with reason. In this way, although the styles of writing have changed in history, the beauty and ugliness of essays, in addition to revision, must first look at whether they are similar to language. Those that do not correspond to language are mostly not worth following.

In short, no matter what style of essay you write, being fluent and clear, like speaking, is the first priority. Stiffness and unnaturalness that do not conform to language habits are all inappropriate.

Respectfully because the tribute envoy is going, the memorial is not appropriate, respectfully stated.

It can be seen that before Cao Yijin, there was a generation of Cao Rengui. According to Jiu Wudai Shi Thirty-one Zhuang Zong Ji Tongguang Second Year May Yichou: "Cao Yijin, the left behind of Quan Zhi Guiyi Army, was made the Jiedushi Shazhou Thorn History Jianjiao Sikong," and Ce Fu Yuan Gui 980 also said that "Cao Yijin, the Shazhou Weishi in Tongguang, sent envoys to pay tribute," Cao Rengui and Cao Yijin were both left behind and Changshi, but Cao Rengui was Jianjiao Ministry of Rites Shangshu, while Cao Yijin was added Jianjiao Sikong by the imperial court. Furthermore, according to the general naming convention, the generation before Yi is often the character Ren, and there are very few cases where the generation before Ren is the character Yi. There is also a lot of evidence that Yuan De and Yuan Zhong were the sons of Yijin, so it is undoubtedly that Rengui was the previous generation of Yijin, and Yijin was the successor of Rengui.

### Mr. Qian Xuantong's Posthumous Letter

Zhizhi:

In the New Annotation of the Book of Songs, the issue of "rhyme," I think can simply be ignored. Because -

We can only examine whether a certain character rhymes with another character in ancient times, or whether they do not rhyme, but we cannot determine how a certain rhyme was pronounced. For example, we know that the "xia" and "nü" of the last chapter of "Picking Watercress" rhymed in the ancient "mo" rhyme, but we cannot determine that this "mo" rhyme is pronounced the same as "X" sound now.

Even if we reluctantly assume it, since the current pronunciation is not like this, it has nothing to do with the syllables of the poems in the Book of Songs.

Moreover, the ancient and modern different pronunciations of these rhyming characters have no impact on the art of poetry.

Therefore, I feel that this matter can be ignored. However, it seems that the difficult characters in the Book of Songs, or those that do not follow the ordinary pronunciation in a certain poem, should be noted for their pronunciation. I think it is best to use phonetic alphabet to note the modern pronunciation — the so-called national pronunciation. "Cheng" is pronounced "　　"; "Nu ru tiao　" of "Tiao" is pronounced "　　"; "Wei she" in Lamb is pronounced "　　　". This is because it is prepared for middle school students to read, so rare characters and rare pronunciations are noted for their pronunciation. Do you agree with this idea?

After you have completed this annotation, I would like to offer a short preface. In this short preface, all "nonsense" will not be said, only one thing will be stated: "Mao" is "mo", "tong" is "shou", and "　" and "xie" in the Peiping poem will be explained in detail, and I think there will be many new annotations of this kind in the future. This layer will definitely arouse the opposition of a group of "inflexible" gentlemen. But I think this is really a revolution for the vulgar annotations said by scholars since the Han and Tang Dynasties. The ancient meaning must be "cleared through the fog to see the blue sky" by using this method. This method is -

Seek the meaning of words from the sound, not being bound by the shape of the characters.

Certify the ancient meaning with modern language.

Since Huang Sheng, Qian Daxin, Wang Niansun and his son invented the method, they have clarified many ancient meanings. Master Zhang Taiyan made a new dialect and invented the method, and clarified many ancient meanings. We must use this method to read ancient books now, and I will use this method, so I plan to write a short preface to commend it, one is to prove that you have used this method to explain many meanings of the characters in the Book of Songs, and the other is to indicate that readers must use this method to verify the difficult-to-understand meanings of the characters in ancient books. What do you think?

Your brother Xuantong, 1922, 8, 27

### On "Arranging Music Sequences"

— Ge Jin'e

Mr. Zhizhi:

My work "Arranging Music Sequences" was published in Shenbao Literature and History Issues 2 and 3 (December 13th and 20th), which I deeply appreciate. However, there are a few points that need to be stated and corrected: 1. It is true that the article says "Mr. Lu did not indicate what version of the Wulin Old Affairs he cited." But then it says, "If we compare several versions of Wulin Old Affairs, we can know that the one he used must be the glossy paper version of the Shanghai Progressive Bookstore." This is probably not my original text. If it is my original text, I also admit that this is my mistake. Because the glossy paper version of the Progressive Bookstore is the same as the Zhizhuzu Studio edition. I have now found the basis for the text cited by Mr. Lu, which was indirectly cited from Mr. Xu Zhiheng's History of Opera (lecture notes printed by the Peking University Publishing Group). However, Mr. Lu only cited the "text" and did not cite the "punctuation." I don't know what this means. Just in terms of text, Mr. Lu did not correct any omissions or unclear places in Xu's History. Therefore, I said, "If you rely on such a version (referring to Xu's History) without consulting other versions for comparison, then Mr. Lu should be held responsible for all the errors in it." 2. The above article was originally sent to the Shanghai Dagong Bao "Literature and History" edited by Mr. Because I saw that Dagong Bao "Literature and History" was suspended, my article was not published, and I thought that this article might not be published. At that time, Mr. Luo Genze asked me for contributions, and because I had already discovered that Mr. Lu's basis was Xu Zhiheng's History of Opera lecture notes, I revised the above article and submitted it to Mr. Luo for publication in the 67th issue of the "Literature and History Bureau Journal" of the Nanjing Central Daily on November 10th. I did not "submit one article to two journals" and deliberately violate the "editing ban". I hereby declare this together. I respectfully wish you editorial success, Lu Jin'e (December 15th)

### Historical Materials on the Power Transition Between the Zhang and Cao Families in Shazhou During the Tang and Five Dynasties

— Lao Gan

Shazhou in Hexi, during the Tang Dynasty, fell to the Tubo in the first year of Zhenyuan (785). In the fifth year of Dazhong (851), Zhang Yichao recovered it and became the Jiedushi of the Guiyi Army. It was passed down to his nephews, Huaishen and his brothers, and his grandnephew, Zhang Chengfeng. During Zhang Chengfeng's time, he proclaimed himself the White-Clad Son of Heaven of the Xihan Jinshan Kingdom. During the Zhenming period of the Zhu Liang Dynasty (915-920), the Zhang family's regime transitioned to the Cao family. According to Luo Zhenyu's "Supplementary Biography of Zhang Yichao of the Tang Dynasty" (from the manuscript of Yongfeng Xiangren) and the "Chronological Table of the Cao Family in Gua and Sha" (revised edition from Qijing Kan Congkan), the Zhang family ended with Zhang Chengfeng, and the Cao family began with Cao Yijin. Afterward, it passed through Cao Yuande, Cao Yuanshen, Cao Yuanzhong, Cao Yangong, Cao Yanlu, Cao Zongshou, and Cao Xianshun. In the fourth year of the Song Dynasty's Huangyou period (1052), they severed their tributary relations with the central court (according to the Song Huiyao). Furthermore, according to the "History of the Song Dynasty, Biography of Xixia," Xixia had already captured the three prefectures of Gua, Sha, and Su in the second year of Jingyou (1035). There is a slight discrepancy here. Combining these two sources, it appears that Xixia only captured a portion of Gua and Sha in the second year of Jingyou, not the entirety, which is why they were still able to pay tribute until the fourth year of Huangyou. Additionally, according to fragments from the Dunhuang Stone Chamber, there is a remnant calendar book from the second year of Jiayou (1057), which is the last year of Chinese rule in Dunhuang that can be ascertained from existing materials. As to whether it completely fell that year, that cannot be proven.

The Zhang family made significant contributions to Dunhuang, and their regime lasted for more than sixty years. During this time, there was a year when it was usurped by Suo Xun, Zhang Yichao's son-in-law, but eventually, it was seized back by Li, another son-in-law of Zhang Yichao, and returned to the Zhang family. As for the circumstances of the transition between the Zhang and Cao families, that is now unclear. According to Zhang Huaiqing's eulogy from the Dunhuang manuscripts copied by Hada Toru, Zhang Huaiqing was from the Nanyang Zhang clan and belonged to the same lineage as Zhang Yichao. The eulogy contains the line, "[ ] King appears, Your Excellency attends in time, assisting closely, paying tribute to your majesty." His official title was "Former Guiyi Army Yingguan Nei Yamen Du Yaya." (The "[ ] King" should be Cao Yijin, who referred to himself as Tuoxi Great King in the Yulin and Mogao Caves. Qiaojun was the ancestral seat of the Cao family.) This suggests that at the time of the rise of the Cao family, there were still members of the Zhang family serving as his close confidants. It seems that the transition between the Cao and Zhang families occurred in a peaceful manner, rather than through a military usurpation.

According to the Zhang Family Meritorious Deeds Record from the Dunhuang manuscripts, Zhang Yichao and Zhang Yitan both died in Chang'an. Yichao had no sons, and Yitan's son, Huaishen, later succeeded Yichao, but his family and friends were probably all in Chang'an. Therefore, after the death of Huaishen's brother, there was only one orphan left, namely Zhang Chengfeng (according to the Li clan's re-inscription of the Meritorious Deeds Stele: "Brother died, younger brother passed, the state tottered, entrusting the orphan, barely escaping hardship." and "Re-illuminating the heir, restoring the surviving grandson."). It is not clear whether Zhang Chengfeng had any heirs. Considering various collateral evidence, Zhang Chengfeng seems to have had no heirs, and figures like Zhang Huaiqing were distant relatives.

Suo Xun and Li Mingzhen were both sons-in-law of Zhang Yichao, but Suo Xun was killed, and Li Mingzhen had already died. Moreover, for Zhang Chengfeng, the Suo and Li families were no longer considered close relatives. Huaishen's son-in-law seems likely to have been Cao Yijin's father. The inscription of the first donor on the north wall of Cave 42 of the Thousand Buddha Caves reads:

The deceased maternal grandfather, former Jiedushi of the eleven prefectures of Hexi, Commissioner of Inspection, Commander of Pacification, Director of Defense, Commander of Farming... (missing middle section) Marquis of Ten Thousand Households, bestowed with a purple fish pouch, Supreme Pillar of the State (missing bottom section)

Furthermore, the inscription of the eighth female donor on the east wall of Cave 75 reads:

The deceased maternal grandmother, Lady Yin of Wuwei Commandery, offering devoutly.

And the inscription of the third female donor on the south wall of Cave 42 reads:

The deceased (maternal) grandmother, Grand Lady Yin of Wuwei

This cave was constructed by the Cao family. The male inscription holder's official title was an official title from the time of the Zhang family's rule in Hexi, and according to other evidence, Huaishen's wife was a member of the Yin family. Therefore, Huaishen was Cao's maternal grandfather (this is based on Mr. Xiang Jueming's transcription and argument from his "Notes on the Western Expedition"). Thus, the Cao family was a closer relative of the Zhang family during Zhang Chengfeng's time than the Suo and Li families were.

Jiang Fu's copy of the "Sand State Archives" contains Cao Rengui's Mid-Autumn Memorial, which states:

May your Excellency's honored body be in excellent health. As of today, Rengui has received grace, but has not yet been able to pay respects in person. My humble feelings of reverence have increased. I humbly request your examination.

### Chi Yizi Pi Was Not Fan Li

— Wang Shumin

The "Fan Lun" chapter of the Huainanzi states: "In the past, Duke Jian of Qi relinquished the reins of his state and entrusted them entirely to senior ministers and generals. They usurped authority and formed factions for their own benefit, and justice was not done. Thus, Chen Cheng and Tian Chang, along with Chi Yizi Pi, were able to accomplish their difficulties."

Qian Daxin stated: "The assertion that Chi Yizi Pi was a member of Tian Chang's faction is not found in other books. According to historical records, Yue had not yet conquered Wu in the year that Tian Chang assassinated the ruler. How could Fan Li have entered Qi? This is an error in the Huainanzi." (Ten Carriages Studio, Cultivating New Records, vol. 12)

My view is that Qian's statement is incorrect. According to the "Biographies of the Money-Makers" in the Historical Records, "After Fan Li wiped away the shame of Kuaiji, he sighed and said, 'Of Ji Ran's seven strategies, Yue employed five and achieved success. Having already applied them to the state, I wish to use them for my family.' Thereupon, he sailed in a small boat on the Five Lakes, changing his name and surname, and went to Qi, becoming [ ] ." This is how Sima Qian identified Fan Li as Chi Yizi Pi, which is the basis of Qian's statement. However, Chi Yizi Pi was not Fan Li. The fact that Chi Yizi Pi was part of Tian Chang's faction is also repeatedly mentioned in other books. The earliest instance is in the "Against Confucianism, Part 2" of the Mozi, which states:

"Confucius was resentful towards Duke Jing and Yanzi, and thus planted Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang." The statement that Confucius planted Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang may be a [ ] expression. But the fact that there was a person named Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang aligns with what is written in the Huainanzi, so it is not a false claim. Another instance can be found in the "Sayings from the Forest, Part 1" of the Han Feizi, which states:

"Chi Ti Zipi served Tian Chengzi. When Tian Chengzi left Qi and fled to Yan, Chi Yizi Pi carried the luggage and followed him. Upon reaching Wangyi, Zipi said, 'Have you not heard of the snake in the dried-up swamp? When the swamp dries up, the snake will move. A small snake said to a large snake, "If you go and I follow, people will only think the snake is moving, and someone will definitely kill you. It's better to bite and carry me as you go, and people will think I am a divine lord." ' They bit and carried each other, avoiding the public road as they traveled. People all avoided them, saying, 'A divine lord!' Now you are handsome, and I am ugly. If you are considered my honored guest, you are the lord of a thousand chariots. If you are considered my envoy, you are a minister of ten thousand chariots. It is better for you to be my attendant." Tian Chengshi carried the luggage and followed him. Upon arriving at an inn, the lord of the inn treated him with great respect and offered him wine and meat."

This passage recounts in detail Chi Yizi Pi's association with Tian Chang's flight to Yan, which proves that there was a person named Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang, and can verify that the Huainanzi's claim is not an error. Another instance can be found in the "Arts of a Minister" chapter of the Shuo Yuan, which states:

"Chen Chengzi said to Chi Yizi Pi, 'What is your relationship with Chang?' The reply was, 'If the lord dies, I will not die; if the lord perishes, I will not perish.' Chen Chengshi said, 'Then how do you serve Chang?' The reply was, 'To leave death before one dies, to leave ruin before one perishes. What death or ruin is there in that?' To obey commands that benefit the lord is called compliant; to obey commands that harm the lord is called flattery. To disobey commands that benefit the lord is called loyalty; to disobey commands that harm the lord is called rebellion. If the lord has faults and one does not remonstrate, it will endanger the state and destroy the altars of the soil and grain. One who can fully speak to the lord, if he is used, he remains; if he is not used, he leaves. This is called remonstrance. If he is used, he lives; if he is not used, he dies. This is called disputation. One who can harmonize and unite, leading the masses to correct the lord together, even if the lord is uneasy, he cannot help but listen, and thus alleviates the great troubles of the state and removes the great harm to the state, achieving the veneration of the lord and the peace of the state, this is called [ ]. One who can defy the lord's commands, reverse the lord's actions, and seize the lord's army to secure the state from danger, remove the lord's disgrace, and wage war to achieve the great benefits of the state, is called an assistant. Therefore, those who remonstrate, dispute, assist, and support are ministers of the state. A wise lord honors and respects them, while a foolish lord considers them enemies. Thus, what a wise lord rewards is what a foolish lord kills. A wise lord loves to ask questions, while a foolish lord loves to be alone. A wise lord elevates the worthy and employs the capable, enjoying their accomplishments; a foolish lord fears the worthy and is jealous of the capable, destroying their achievements, punishing the loyal and rewarding the rebellious. This is called utter [ ], the reason why Jie and Zhou perished. The Book of Odes says, "Never listen to them, and the great mandate will collapse." This is what it means.' This passage recounts in detail Chi Yizi Pi's discussion with Tian Chang about 'If the lord dies, I will not die; if the lord perishes, I will not perish,' which proves that there was a person named Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang, and also verifies that the Huainanzi's claim is not an error. Another instance can be found in the "Pointing to Weapons" chapter, which states:

"Tian Chengzi Chang was arguing with Zai Wo. Zai Wo ambushed soldiers at night, intending to attack Tian Chengzi, and ordered the soldiers, 'Do not rise unless you see the signal flag.' Chi Yizi Pi revealed this and informed Tian Chengzi. Tian Chengzi then used the signal flag to raise Zai Wo's soldiers and attack him, and thus destroyed him." This passage recounts Chi Yizi Pi's and Tian Chang's attack on Zai Wo, which also proves that there was a person named Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang. Therefore, all the Chi Yizi Pis mentioned in various books and the Huainanzi are not Fan Li who went from Yue to Qi. According to the "Arts of a Minister" chapter of the Shuo Yuan,

"Chi Yizi Pi relied on Qu Chun, and Sun Po was his friend. The intelligence of these two men was enough to make them prime ministers, but they did not dare display their intelligence and instead entrusted it to Qu Chun."

This shows that he was alive during the reign of King Ping of Chu, clearly distinguishing him as a different person from Fan Li. However, why did Sima Qian refer to Fan Li as Chi Yizi Pi? There must have been a reason. Based on the evidence cited above, Chi Yizi Pi was indeed a person of "great intelligence and suspicion." Perhaps after Fan Li left Yue, he compared himself to Chi Yizi Pi, and Sima Qian adopted this into his writings?

The records in the Mozi, Han Feizi, and Shuo Yuan can all corroborate the Huainanzi's claim. Qian carelessly glossed over the facts and hastily declared the Huainanzi to be in error. Once a mistake is made, it is difficult for superiors to avoid criticism. (Written at the end of the thirty-sixth year while visiting Jinling)

### Fireside Chats

— He Ku

On cold winter nights, breath turns to frost. After sitting at a desk for a long time, a cup of malted milk seems to ease the chill. A poetic line says, "On a cold night, a guest arrives, treat him like wine." At this moment, I experience the meaning of that poem; drinking a cup of hot tea can warm the whole body. Actually, when a guest arrives on a cold night, why not drink wine? The best situation is to have a roaring fireplace. Warming oneself by the fireplace while chatting closely is one of life's joys.

Of course, a fireplace is the most ideal. My own room originally had a fireplace installed, but because it was sealed off during the war years, the chimney was blocked. Also, with the continuous increase in the number of people, it became increasingly inadequate as a bedroom. It became a kind of mixed-use room. Finally, in order to gain this bit of extra space, I removed the fireplace. Now, the space once occupied by the fireplace is now occupied by a small cabinet, and even the lingering charm of the fireplace cannot be recalled.

The other day, I went to a friend's house. Not only did he have Nandina and winter plum on his desk, but he also had a charcoal brazier for warming hands. The burning charcoal was warm and radiant, filling the room with spring. The room's rustic elegance was just right. Did the owner perhaps achieve a sense of serenity in the ordinary? Having a charcoal brazier for warmth may be common in the north, but in today's war-torn conditions, it may be difficult. If it is in the south, where transportation is difficult today, installing a fireplace is not something you or I can do easily. Therefore, having a charcoal brazier to warm hands can be considered satisfying.

The most desirable thing, of course, is a fireplace burning firewood. When humans long for the past, they often gain relaxing and comfortable memories. I am no exception. Last winter, I went to a friend's house for dinner several times. Their family had a usable fireplace. The host split cedar wood to start the fire. Several people sat around peeling melon seeds and walnuts. The burning wood made crackling sounds, as if sparks were about to fly out of the fireplace. The faces of all of us were illuminated by the warm firelight, turning them into a bright, light crimson, like a light buzz after tasting fine wine. The night was late and the evening wore on. It was a very pleasant night. There is a Western saying, "Splitting wood and starting a fire with your own hands can warm you twice." I think the best environment for splitting wood for warmth is a fireplace. A person warming himself by the fireplace not only gains warmth, but can also feel as if he is falling back into the era of "the good old days."

Of course, in today's devastated and starving cities, we don't hope to enjoy excessive pleasures. Having enough to eat and wearing warm clothes is already not easy. Wanting to warm oneself by a fireplace, although it is a pleasure that life should offer, still carries a hint of luxury today. Be mindful of danger in times of peace. We are fortunate to be able to occasionally warm ourselves with a charcoal brazier at this time and in this place.

### My Love of Reading

— Jin Jin

Humans are selfish and self-serving animals, always starting from "the self." My writing about my love of reading here cannot escape the fault of egoism, as I am expounding on my "brilliant views," which may just be other people's "biases" or "narrow views."

I love Amy Lowell's poems, John Dos Passos's novels, and I haven't yet discovered a favorite writer in terms of essays.

Amy Lowell was an American female poet, born at the beginning of the 20th century, and died about twenty years ago. I used to collect some materials about her life, but they were all scattered due to accidents. She excels at writing love poems, using delicate language and profound meaning as her specialties. With a woman's delicate style, she expresses the highest love between men and women. I first encountered her works in Beiping and finished reading all four or five volumes of her poetry collections. After coming south, I searched for her collections in various bookstores and secondhand bookshops, but I could never buy them. The only thing I could find was one or two works in poetry selections. If I remember correctly, perhaps "The Golden Treasury" also includes her masterpiece.

I used to be able to recite her poems, reciting them fluently, but now, due to the busyness of life, I have forgotten most of them. However, I still remember the general idea of one poem, which shows her general conception. Her poem says that there was a painter who was painting a picture of the sun, but after the lover came, the sun faded. Why? The original poem does not explain. I think the clever readers can certainly guess that the original poem is praising the lover's brilliance, which makes the sun pale in comparison.

In terms of the types of poems, her works can be classified as Symbolist. She had a great deal of knowledge of Eastern learning. She once mentioned the Chinese poetry saint Li Bai in a poem, saying that the strangeness in his poems came from the strange scenes he saw after drinking. She gave an explanation for the reason for the fame of the number one genius in the poetry world, which is not without considerable meaning.

Speaking of John Dos Passos, he is another novelist whom I admire privately. This writer of the vast, million-word "U.S.A." trilogy (The 42nd Parallel, 1919, The Big Money) has made [ ] achievements in his use of words and psychological analysis. I follow the characters in the book, singing and weeping with them. Some of the descriptions made me cry.

John himself is an honorary graduate of Harvard University. He participated in World War I, and his book "Three Soldiers," published in 1921, was based on his wartime experiences and has since been considered the standard of war literature.

In addition to my private admiration for literary books, in terms of my "profession" - economics - I very much like to read Stuart Chase's articles. Chase's writing style is lively and full of passion, with thorough and detailed reasoning. He emphasizes "practicality" everywhere and does not engage in empty talk. This is another characteristic of his works.

Chase's academic background is as follows: he studied accounting and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology early in his career, and later specialized in economics at Harvard University. Afterward, he performed accounting work for private companies and government agencies for fourteen years. He is the author of "Men and Machines," "Mexico," and other books, and often has articles published in various popular magazines in the United States.

Finally, I would like to present another book, titled "Commonsense Speculation." It was written by someone under the name of "Insider" and published by Barron's, a financial publisher in New York. It is a book written for merchants, and the writing is not good. Moreover, there are places where the grammar is incorrect. However, if the reader is interested in speculation, or wants to know some common knowledge in this area, it is worth reading. My final statement is: My introduction of this book is not to encourage speculation. Anyway, speculation has been strictly prohibited by the authorities and can no longer cause trouble.

### Abandoned Funds

— Dao Xian

People are sometimes quite forgetful, and some people even forget the money they have in the bank. These "abandoned funds" in American banks amount to as much as 250 million US dollars. Even people who buy lottery tickets and win forget to claim the prize. Residents of New York City had as much as 40,000 US dollars in cash sealed in "dead letters" in 1946. This is because they forgot to write the sender's address or wrote the wrong address. There are 500,007 packages across the United States that cannot be delivered because of incorrect addresses. These packages contain valuable Persian lambskin, seventeen-jewel watches, and cameras.

People work hard and save money by eating frugally, putting a little money in the bank. They should never forget these deposits. But as of March 31, 1945, New York State received 4,731,000 dollars in unclaimed deposits from banks. New Jersey received 800,000 dollars, and Kentucky received about 400,000 dollars.

Chase Bank in New York finally found a female depositor, but she herself did not remember ever having entered the bank's door. But the signature was exactly the same, proving that the deposit was indeed hers.

Many of the "abandoned" deposits are secretly deposited by husbands and wives without letting the other know, and in the end, he or she forgets the money themselves. There are also some deposits that people made when they were children, forgot when they grew up, and never touched throughout their lives. Some people deposit money for their children, but forget to explain this clearly when they pass away.

The laws of thirty-six states in the United States deal with the issue of abandoned funds. For example, in New York State, if a deposit is unclaimed for more than fifteen years, it reverts to the state. South Carolina stipulates that if a deposit is unclaimed for more than five years, it is transferred to the fund for state universities. Minnesota's deadline is twenty years.

Although the law strictly stipulates how to deal with abandoned funds, people are still forgetful as usual. The total amount of these abandoned funds is now enough to cover the one-year expenses of Delaware, Utah, Wyoming, Mississippi, Colorado, and Arkansas.

There are also many people who forget the deposits for public utilities such as telephone, gas, and electricity. Accumulated over many years, this is also a considerable amount. For example, by the end of 1946, Consolidated Edison of New York had accumulated $3.35 million in unclaimed deposits, all of which were transferred to the state government.

Many people forget things when they travel. The lost and found office of Pullman Company in New York picks up an average of 500 items in train cars each month, including jewelry worth 20,000 dollars and dentures.

The strangest forgetfulness occurs in horse racing. Many people throw away or tear up winning tickets. Someone bought number five, but number eight won. He threw away the ticket, but after a while, number eight was disqualified, and number five won.

For example, someone bought number two, but the ticket was mistakenly given to him as number three. Number three won, and he thought he had bought number two, so he tore it up.

At the end of the most recent horse racing season, the New York State Treasury received 200,000 dollars in unclaimed winning tickets.

There are also people who forget to make a will, causing many property disputes after death.

### Happy-Go-Lucky Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Six: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (44)

Zhu Zhai said, "You must pluck up your courage and not be concerned about Lu. You must think, if my relationship with her was very good, then it would be wrong for you to come out and provoke her, tempting her to divorce. Now that my relationship with the two of us has deteriorated to such an extent, it is for her future happiness that you are persuading her. What is wrong with that?" As he said this, he stood up and bowed deeply to Yunqing, saying, "Please have mercy and save the two of us!" Yunqing feigned anger and said, "Don't talk nonsense. I first want to ask you, what are your divorce conditions? If the conditions are good, I can observe the situation and give it a try. If the conditions are not good, I won't do this immoral thing!" Zhu Zhai said, "My conditions are as follows: First, after she divorces me, all her living expenses will still be borne by me until she gets married." Yunqing said, "If she doesn't get married, you will be responsible for providing for her for the rest of your life, is that right?" Zhu Zhai said, "Don't be anxious, I haven't finished speaking! Second, after the divorce, we must still maintain our friendship. If she has any difficulties that I should help with, I will do my best to help. Third, the divorce between the two of us will be settled privately by signing a contract between ourselves, without the need to announce it. Fourth, if she needs me to give her a lump sum of money to sever ties forever, I can also do that. Fifth, if she agrees to maintain a friendship with me, I can still go to her place to chat and have meals. Sixth, my current house and all the furniture will be given to her, excluding my clothes and all my books, etc." Yunqing listened to Zhu Zhai reciting these conditions, and felt both amused and annoyed. She asked, "Are you joking, or do you really want to divorce her? How can you propose such nonsensical conditions?" Zhu Zhai said sternly, "I think this is the best way to divorce Fengsheng. I want to oppose divorce for my family, so I don't want to announce this matter. For the sake of Fengsheng's future living problems, I will provide her with alimony and give her the house and all the furniture. To avoid hurting her, I will still maintain our friendship, and we can meet often. These conditions of mine are purely for her sake, without any selfishness. My divorce from her is not because of any hatred, but entirely for the sake of each other's future happiness. Do you understand my meaning?" Yunqing pursed her lips and said, "Don't make it sound so high-sounding. A person wouldn't casually divorce his wife unless it was a major issue!" Zhu Zhai said, "I don't deny what you said. In short, I want a divorce certificate from her to avoid committing bigamy, and I don't want to cause family disputes, so I formulated these conditions. Do you think they are appropriate? If there is anything inappropriate, it can be revised." Yunqing said, "I'm not a lawyer, so I can't talk about revising the conditions. However, you are willing to give her living expenses, give her a house, etc., so you are still somewhat moral, and you haven't completely abandoned her. If she is clear-headed and can see the future clearly, planning for her own future happiness, these conditions may not be unacceptable. However, whether her thinking is the same is unknown!" Zhu Zhai said, "Then, I rely entirely on my Buddha-like lotus tongue to guide and enlighten her ignorance!"

### Forgetfulness

— Mao Yi

There was a woman who was so worried that she suffered from neurasthenia. One day, she was watching a play with her husband in a theater, when she suddenly remembered something and said:

"Oh, John, I just remembered that I forgot to turn off the electric iron."

Her husband didn't care at all and replied lightly, "Don't worry, darling. I just happened to forget to turn off the faucet in the bathtub, so water and fire counteract each other, and nothing will happen. Just watch your play!"

### Liu Bieqian's Achievement

— Pingzhai

The death of Liu Bieqian is not only a loss to Hollywood, but also to the world film industry, which has lost an incomparable treasure. The world is gradually tending to equate Hollywood with low-level burlesque, which is actually very unfair. Hollywood does not lack serious people who strive for art, and Liu Bieqian is one of them.

Now, anyone who talks about movies, whenever mentioning the difference between movies and stage plays, the most appropriate saying is: movies bring the audience closer to the actors—because movies have close-ups, the slight trembling of the corner of an actor's mouth holding a cigarette, or the gentle fluttering of the eyelashes of an ecstatic girl, can be amplified by the power of "close-ups" so that even the most insensitive audience will not overlook them. On stage, your movements cannot but be slightly exaggerated, and the range of your body movements must be larger than usual—because if you don't, the audience sitting further back will not be able to understand the emotions you want to express. The same is true for makeup. On stage, your makeup must be very heavy and the contrast very obvious, but this is not the case in movies.

Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the biggest difference between stage and film is that film has close-ups. And Liu Bieqian was the first person in the film industry to use close-ups. In other words, the close-up in film was invented by Liu Bieqian. Eisenstein of the Soviet Union made further attempts, trying to expand the "close-up" further to achieve the effect of "exaggerated satire" (Caricature), but obviously his attempt failed, and we cannot imagine how much Caricature can play in tragedy.

Liu Bieqian deeply understood that the difference between film and drama lies in the length of the distance from the audience, so his "small movements" have achieved unprecedented success, which is the so-called "Liu Bieqian touch" (Lubltshe touch). These small movements are often impossible to perform on stage, especially for less important roles in the back stage. However, in movies, because the director has the freedom to choose the frame, even in a "medium shot" it can be expressed clearly and powerfully. Needless to say, it is even more so in close-ups. Some people call this technique "delicate", but in fact every director with artistic conscience is working "delicately"; Liu Bieqian has a "camera eye" (Camera eye), and when he sees a slight movement that can be touching, he seizes it, expands it, and emphasizes it. This is exactly like a good journalist must have a "news eye": the first element is to have the sensitivity of an artist, the second is to have the ability to think from the perspective of the audience (or reader), and the third is to be able to fully develop and yet properly restrain when discovering such a wonderful scene (the most brilliant display is also the strictest restraint).

Wasn't Reinhardt a master in the theater world? But his movie "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is a lavish waste, a miserable failure of overflowing talent. The crux is very simple, he almost entirely used medium shots, he is the king of the stage, he is loyal to the stage—and ignores the characteristics of film.

The only one who can compete with Liu Bieqian is Rene Clair of France. Perhaps I should say that this French master is even better than Liu Bieqian in handling "transition of stories"; in terms of wit and humor, the two seem similar. However, in the history of film, the one who resolutely broke away from the scope of the stage is Liu Bieqian.

### Advertisement

— Le

The skills of American advertisers are certainly beyond doubt. But if we look at an advertisement in an American newspaper fifty years ago, we will have a different impression. The advertisement said: "Please buy Quanbai brand toothpaste—this toothpaste is not of higher quality than general toothpaste, and the price is not cheaper than general toothpaste. However, this toothpaste is made by my nephew. He is young and promising and knows how to make progress. If this kind of toothpaste sells well, then he may be able to get married with this profit. I hope all sectors of society will take care of him."

### More on Plagiarism

— Leike

I wrote an article on "plagiarism" for this publication before. A friend who teaches saw it, and he told me two interesting things about plagiarism, which are worth recording. He teaches in a girls' middle school, so the things he remembers are all about female students.

Once, this teacher was grading compositions and read an extremely fluent article. The student's handwriting was very neat, which made it particularly pleasant to read. However, near the end of the article, he suddenly saw a sentence that was not only incoherent but also strangely difficult to understand:——"There is only a white slave." He thought for a long time, and he finally figured it out. It turned out to be "well-known". The girl had an older brother at a university, and she copied his coursework, because the original manuscript was too sloppy, so she misread the words.

There is another thing worth writing about in detail. Not only can it illustrate the copyist's willingness to make mistakes, but it can also warn plagiarists that they are bound to fall into a trap. What is recorded here is not a composition, but a history exam. In this class, there were two students sitting together, one with excellent grades and the other who liked to steal a little, often chatting in the classroom. Whenever there was an exam, she would never prepare carefully. She also had a big problem, which was that she liked to peek at the exam papers of the students next to her and copy them as they were. And the female student next to her was too embarrassed not to let her copy.

In this exam, one of the questions was to ask who the founder of Buddhism was. After the exam, the teacher graded the exam papers. The two students sitting together got excellent grades. They answered all the questions correctly, except for this one question, which was answered very strangely and comically——"Fallen beauty". If translated according to the transliteration, it may not be wrong, but it is ultimately inelegant. The teacher certainly understood the mystery behind it. The hardworking student could not prevent others from plagiarizing, and was unwilling to report it publicly. The teacher also did not take care of it properly in the examination hall and could not catch the thief. So she came up with this clever plan, setting a trap for the literary copyist (?) next door to stumble into. In this way, the teacher couldn't help but discover it. After discovering it, they couldn't ignore it. The teacher didn't say anything, but graded one paper with ninety-five points and the other with zero points. The student who plagiarized was also "sensible." She ate the loss silently. This attitude is much smarter than the general literary copyist who doesn't buy it.

### False and Fake

— Lingxiaohan Pavilion

After the Japanese occupied North China, their first goal was the economy. The people they originally intended to establish the puppet organization were two: Zhang Daishan and Wang Shulu, both of whom had served as finance ministers and were veterans in this field. Daishan was seriously ill, and Xida (the Japanese special agent who arranged the puppets) visited him but could not meet him, so he decided to use Wang. Zhang died in Tianjin in the spring of the twenty-seventh year, at the age of sixty-three, the same age as Kemin. They were from the same hometown in Zhejiang and were also successful candidates in the imperial examination, but Wang's exam was one session earlier than Zhang's (Wang Dingyou, Zhang Renyin). He liked to squander money, and although he had held financial positions many times, he was extremely poor in his later years. His home could not even afford a stove, and he became ill from worry. Given his predicament, it is unknown whether he would have been clean if he had lived. It was fortunate that he passed away at this time, preserving his reputation.

Wang also liked luxury. At that time, the treasury was empty, and his rise to power was partly to clear his own debts, which officials call "taking a bath." During the five months from August to December of the twenty-sixth year, Japanese gold notes, puppet banknotes, puppet Manchurian notes, national currency (Central Bank of China notes), and Hebei Provincial Bank notes were all in circulation in the market. When the puppet "Provisional Government" was established, Wang issued the so-called "United Reserve Bank" notes, devaluing the national currency and gradually discontinuing its use. At the same time, he gradually eliminated Japanese, puppet Manchurian, and puppet Mongolian notes, making the puppet "United Reserve Bank" the only currency, with an exchange rate of "one to one" with Japanese notes. After serving as a puppet for more than two years, another old "Wang" (Yitang) succeeded him, who was purely "bowing and scraping" and had nothing to say other than bowing and smiling, and he also muddled through for more than two years. After a short transition by someone surnamed Zhu (Shen), a small "Wang" (Yintai, the son of Wang Shitong, the head of the Yuan government's secretariat) came to power for more than a year. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, the puppet regime ended, and he played the role of the "filial son" who saw it to its end. In ancient times, there was the Li family who "generationally wrote surrender memorials." Now there is the Wang family who "specializes in playing puppets," which can be said to be a contrasting pair.

In January of the twenty-seventh year, the puppet "Provisional Government" appeared. From the perspective of the National Government and the Chinese people, it was naturally denounced as a "puppet government." What is wonderful is that Japanese newspapers also called it China's "fake government." China called it "puppet," which is the "puppet" of "puppet," that is, the "puppet" in Luo Binwang's proclamation against Wu Zetian, "the puppet Wu clan who usurped the throne." And the "fake" that the Japanese called it is the "fake" in Han Xin's willingness to be a "fake king" when he conquered Qi, that is, the "fake" in Wang Mang's claim to be a "fake emperor." "Fake" means power, temporary. The text after "fake" is "true," and the text after "temporary" is "official." Therefore, the word "similar" does have a hint of "temporary." The Japanese still like refined language and like to use classical allusions, so they also called the "Provisional Government" that they arranged themselves "fake." And the meaning of "fake" and "puppet" is basically the same. It seems that the Japanese themselves admitted to playing puppets, which can be said to be "confessing without being beaten," which is wonderful.
