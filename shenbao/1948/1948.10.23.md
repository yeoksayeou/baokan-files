[Our Newspaper, Huludao, 22nd] Bandit troops between Tashan and Gaoqiao are retreating eastward. The National Army has captured several of their soldiers. The Liao Corps is approaching Jinxi.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] To seize the initiative, the National Army in Jinxi launched an attack on the 20th, swiftly recovering Shuangyubao, located ten li south of Yinan. On the 21st, they further recovered Hanjia Gou, twelve kilometers away. Bandit independent divisions such as the Independent Sixth and Independent Eighth fled towards Xingcheng from the aforementioned areas, pursued by the National Army. The bandits at Tashan, under heavy attack by the National Army, feel greatly threatened and are hastily constructing fortifications. Due to heavy casualties, they are busy replenishing their forces. Small skirmishes continue to occur in nearby areas, and the National Army is also making deployments. The bandits east of the Daling River are feeling the threat from the westward advance of the Shenyang corps. There are signs that Lin Biao and his command are moving from Beizhen to another location. Furthermore, the bandit Tenth Column is rushing from the area south of Xinlitun towards Beizhen, hoping to strengthen Beizhen's defenses.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] The bandit Eighth Column in the Northeast appears to be lying in wait in Jinzhou. The Second Column is in Goubangzi, the First Column is in Heishan Dahushan, the Fifth and Sixth Columns are in the Fuxin area, the Tenth Column is southwest of Xinlitun, and the Twelfth Column is in Kaiyuan. In total, the bandits have twelve field columns in the Northeast, and almost all have now been deployed south of the Liao River to the western Liaoning area.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd] Our crack troops advancing from Xinlitun decisively routed the bandit Tenth Column of Maoshan Ju on the 20th, killing and wounding over 700 bandits.

Our other army, advancing westward from Yujiangtun (between Xinlitun and Zhangwu), approached Jiuhuan Chi (northeast of Fuxin) yesterday. The bandit Fifth Column stationed there was forced to retreat towards Fuxin, and the National Army is advancing towards Jiuhuan Chi and the Fuxin line.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] There is a possibility that the entirety of southern Liaoning will come under National Army control. Currently, military operations are proceeding according to plan. The Shuifeng hydroelectric plant on the Yalu River, which connects lines to Anshan, Yingkou, Dahushan, Goubangzi, Fuxin, and other places, had been providing power regularly after the communist bandits occupied Anshan. During their recent rout, they did not destroy the plant beforehand. It was reconnected to Shenyang at noon on the 10th, transmitting 10,000 kilowatts daily. However, on the night of the 20th, the bandits suddenly cut the power, depriving Shenyang of a source of electricity. Anshan and the bandit-controlled areas are now without light. The bandits may have anticipated that they would not be able to hold Yingkou, Dahushan, and Fuxin for long.

### Proposal to Announce Soviet Breach of Contract Facts; Heated Debate in Legislative Yuan; Vote Result is to First Question the Executive Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The 13th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 22nd, chaired by Chen Lifu. The meeting began at 9:30 AM. After listening to two reports, the discussion of the "Organizational Regulations of the Legislative Yuan's Disciplinary Committee" began. After discussing the draft prepared by the Legislative Committee article by article, without any amendments, it was passed. Subsequently, the report by the Foreign Affairs Committee on the review of Pan Chaoying's and others' proposal requesting the government to announce the facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in order to correct international public opinion and clarify right and wrong sparked heated debate. Mr. Pan's original proposal listed evidence of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-American Treaty, believing that the current severe military, political, and economic situation in our country was largely caused by the conspiracy of international communists. Diplomatic measures were weak, unable to correct international public opinion and inspire national morale. He advocated requesting the government to announce all facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, lodging a serious protest with the Soviet Union, and if it was still ineffective, filing a complaint with the United Nations. During the Foreign Affairs Committee's review, Deputy Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao and Deputy Director of the National Government Ye Nan were invited to attend and report, as well as answer inquiries. After repeated detailed discussions, it was decided to report to the Yuan and first question the government. However, Mr. Pan and some other proposing members still declared their opposition, reserving the right to speak at the general meeting. Therefore, after the Foreign Affairs Committee's report was read by the secretariat and explained by the convener Zhang Daohang, Qi Zhihou and Pan Chaoying immediately raised objections, advocating for the original proposal to be passed. Mr. Pan pointed out that the government's provincial governors had repeatedly publicly admitted that the Soviet Union had indeed violated the Sino-Soviet Treaty, such as providing limited assistance to the communist bandits, hindering the takeover of Dalian, sending aircraft to participate in the Beitashan battle, and looting Northeast factories and allowing the Red Army to burn, kill, rape, and plunder in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia. Foreign Affairs officials also answered inquiries in the Foreign Affairs Committee, stating that the facts of the Soviet Union's breach of contract could not be officially announced until the situation was completely desperate. The current international and domestic situations are extremely serious, and it is time to resolutely announce these facts. He also said that if it is believed that announcing the Soviet Union's breach of contract will trigger a Sino-Soviet war, it is a groundless fear. However, Zhang Qingzhen immediately expressed opposition, believing that the facts of the Soviet Union's breach of contract have long been known to all, and there is no need to formally announce them again. As for the two steps of lodging a serious protest with the Soviet Union and filing a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly after the announcement, considering the country's strength and the world situation, it is feared that it will also be useless. Even questioning is not appropriate, as the government's unavoidable difficulties in dealing with Soviet diplomacy are well understood by everyone, and there is no need for the Legislative Yuan to question and propose explanations. Therefore, he advocated that the case be reserved. Cui Shuqin supported the Foreign Affairs Committee's review report. He emphasized that announcing the Soviet Union's breach of contract is an important diplomatic step, and there should be strong and effective action preparations afterward. Although a third world war may not be avoidable, we must not rashly take war as a way out, let alone be sacrificed first. Therefore, the consideration of diplomatic actions should be extremely cautious. As for the strength of the United Nations, before the veto issue is resolved, it is difficult to expect effective results after this issue is raised. The meeting adjourned at noon. The meeting continued at 3:30 PM. Chen Ruxuan again supported the passage of the original proposal. She recalled that when the Legislative Yuan agreed to ratify the Sino-Soviet Treaty two and a half years ago, it believed that although the treaty was humiliating, it could bring 30 years of peace and stability, so it reluctantly approved it. Who would have thought that even this equal treaty could not be truly fulfilled by the Soviet Union? Today, the high arrogance of the communist bandits and the deterioration of the domestic situation are all caused by the Soviet Union. She accused diplomacy of being weak and lacking policy, advocating for the government to announce the facts of the Soviet Union's breach of contract according to the original proposal, and file a complaint with the United Nations, so that the people can understand the government's difficulties and the true background of the communist bandit rebellion, and the world can also understand the Soviet Union's ambitions. Zhang Qianhua called for dealing with this matter rationally and considering what consequences would arise from this showdown behavior, advocating that the entire case be reserved. In total, about ten people spoke and submitted written opinions in the morning and afternoon. Finally, Yu Zheng and others' motion to stop the discussion was established. As a result of the vote, out of 262 attending members, 201 supported the review report, and it was decided to present a question to the Executive Yuan. The text of the case: "Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the treaty have emerged endlessly. After three years, it has not only caused serious domestic disputes, but also constitutes an international crisis and affects world peace. Has the government prepared any measures to maintain the dignity of the treaty and ensure national sovereignty? We hereby raise this question." At 5:00 PM, the discussion of the National Defense Committee's report on convening an enlarged meeting to review and investigate the responsibility for the loss of the Jinan battle began. Due to the matter involving military secrets, the meeting was changed to a closed meeting with the consent of the attendees. According to the Legislative Yuan Newsroom, the case was passed according to the review opinions and changed to a question. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

### Agencies' Policy Plans for Next Year Should Strive for Simplification; Executive Yuan Orders Compliance with Relevant Matters

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Regarding the formulation of policy plans and the assessment of work for the 38th year of the Republic by agencies subordinate to the Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan has recently stipulated several matters that should be noted and ordered all agencies to comply. The details are as follows:

A. Planning Aspects: (1) Policy plans (including administrative, operational, and business aspects) should strive for simplification, focusing on numbers. Regular administrative work does not need to be included. Agencies can decide whether to list items separately or use concise tables. (2) The plans of each agency, together with the preliminary estimates, will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then forwarded to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to compile the general budget proposal and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for approval. Each agency will then prepare a policy plan table and a monthly or quarterly schedule based on the budget as a basis for implementation and for the Executive Yuan to use for assessment.

B. Assessment Aspects: (1) Written reports are divided into two types: periodic and ad hoc. The monthly progress of important tasks and reviews, as well as the difficulties encountered in promoting work and the reasons for not being able to proceed according to the planned schedule, should be noted in the report and in the remarks column. Site inspections, supervision, rewards, and punishments should also be noted during the assessment.

C. Retention or Abolition of the Design Assessment Committee: Whether or not to establish an assessment committee in each agency is to be decided by each agency itself. However, if established, the principle is still to not increase personnel or expenses.

D. Planning, Formulation and Assessment during the Period of Not Yet Electing Provincial Governments: During the period when provincial and municipal governments have not yet been elected, the formulation and assessment of their plans shall still be handled in accordance with the procedures for central second-level agencies.

### Striving for the Initiative on the Central China Battlefield; National Army Holds the Handle of Victory; Xu Zuyi Reports on the Battle Situation to Reporters

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] General Xu Zuyi, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Central China, hosted reporters in the afternoon of the 22nd and reported on the battle situation in Central China. With an excited tone, he pointed out that the military situation for suppressing the rebellion in Central China has now broken through the past situation and has definitely gained the initiative. The great battle brewing in southern Henan and northern Hubei and the bandits' attempt to provide reinforcements have been completely grasped by the White General Commander-in-Chief's brilliant plan. Xu analyzed the bandit's situation and said: Since mid-September, Liu Fei has mobilized its 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, 10th, and 12th columns, totaling eight columns, and gathered in the northeastern area of Nanyang, preparing to besiege Nanyang and destroy the railway along the line from Xinyang to Queshan, in order to coordinate with Chen Fei's offensive in Shandong. Seeing that our deployment was comprehensive and fearing annihilation, he fled back to Yuxian in early October, with the 1st, 3rd, and 4th columns occupying Wuchang, Fangcheng and Nanzhao, and the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 12th columns fleeing south to Pingshi (south of Biyang) and Huyang, in an attempt to avoid a decisive battle and defend by attacking. On the 15th of this month, with the 2nd and 6th columns fleeing south to the northwest of Ying Shanxi, our army had already prepared. We launched a fierce counterattack immediately. The bandit army suffered heavy losses and had to retreat westward on the 17th. At the moment, the bandits 2nd and 6th columns are fleeing to Maozifan (west of Suixian), and the 10th and 12th columns are fleeing to the area north of Zaoyang, and we are encircling and suppressing them. Talking about the battle results of the past half month, Xu said: (1) There are no large bandit troops in the Jianghan area and the Dabie Mountain area; (2) After the National Army occupied Biyang, the main force of Liu Fei was forced to flee north and south. At present, the vast area between Nanyang and Queshan, Suiping, and Xiping has been recovered under our control. (3) After Suixian and Zaoyang were recovered, a part of Liu Fei's main force has been greatly threatened. At the moment, the handle of victory has been completely grasped by us. It is expected that a greater victory in encircling and annihilating them will be achieved within days.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 22nd] A large number of bandit troops from Wanxi have gathered.

### Seeing the Crisis in Asia from South Korea

In South Korea, more than 3,000 policemen in Yeosu suddenly launched a mutiny on the 20th, and with lightning speed, occupied the two cities of Yeosu and Suncheon in one fell swoop, and called on all the Korean people to overthrow the newly established Korean government. At that time, Seoul immediately declared martial law to prevent the fifth column from taking the opportunity to act. Defense Minister Lee Beom-seok immediately dispatched two brigades of regular troops from Jeonju to suppress the rebellion. They immediately defeated this group of motley rebel forces led by the communists, and withdrew south toward Gurye, fleeing into the mountains. Looking at the general trend, the South Korean government is able to control the overall situation, and there should be no problem; however, the mutiny that occurred in South Korea this time happened just when the Soviet troops in North Korea began to withdraw, and it is definitely not comparable to ordinary events. Moreover, whether these motley rebel forces will disappear from now on after fleeing into the mountains, and no longer be a future problem for South Korea, is also a serious problem. At least at this time, when the current situation has not been completely clarified, we cannot make rash judgments.

According to Reuters, "Some parties do not believe that this mutiny in South Korea is related to the withdrawal of Soviet troops in North Korea, nor do they believe that it is related to the communist activities in South Korea. These motley rebel forces do not seem to be communist elements in South Korea. There was no plan beforehand, and after occupying the two cities of Yeosu and Suncheon, they did not consolidate their positions, and then withdrew southward." Judging from this, the mutiny of the Yeosu police in South Korea does not seem to be the rebellion of the South Korean communists, but a political demonstration. But from our third-party point of view, the inside story of the mutiny in South Korea will never be so simple, and its meaning should not be ignored.

Although the United States is very cautious about this mutiny because the U.S. military is not involved in the vortex, the State Department and the Army Department are closely watching the development of the South Korean situation, and believe that if the South Korean situation deteriorates, the U.S. military commander stationed in South Korea can immediately take action. Only from this point of view, the mutiny in South Korea may not only expand into a civil war in Korea, but also, if not careful, may evolve into a full-scale war in Asia. We do not want to be alarmist, but we cannot help but point out the facts we have recently seen in Northeast Asia in order to arouse the vigilance of all countries related to the Far East about the crisis in Asia.

First, the new South Korean government was established not long ago, and North Korea quickly caught up and also organized a North Korean government, and immediately obtained Soviet recognition, and sent Steikov as a special ambassador, who will further conclude a military alliance as an aid to North Korea's resistance against South Korea. In the event of a military conflict between North Korea and South Korea in the future, the Soviet Union can provide military assistance in the name of an allied country. In addition, the Soviet Union has also adopted an offensive in diplomacy, first announcing that the Soviet troops have withdrawn from North Korea, forcing the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea to withdraw to their country. In this way, the entire Korea may fall under Soviet control! The Soviet Union has long harbored ulterior motives for South Korea. Communist cells are lurking in the police or army in South Korea. This time, the Yeosu police mutiny was expected by those who are familiar with the internal situation of Korea.

Second, the current focus of Britain and the United States is on Europe. Because of the Berlin blockade, they are trying to use the United Nations Security Council to condemn the Soviet Union's blockade behavior as a threat to world peace, and attempt to have a showdown with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union took the opportunity of Britain and the United States neglecting Asia and launched an offensive in Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia to coordinate with the communist bandits' rebellion in China. The activity of communist forces in Southeast Asian countries has already been discussed in the editorial of this newspaper; now, a mutiny has suddenly occurred in South Korea, and its meaning is exactly the same, that is, the Soviet Union wants to control the entire Asia behind the scenes. Therefore, the mutiny in South Korea this time is an alarm for Asia, giving a head-on blow to Britain and the United States who only know that the communist forces are gradually advancing to Western Europe and ignoring the Asian crisis. The German anti-communist leader regarded the South Korean mutiny as a warning to Germany, and believed that Germany may become Korea today in the future, which contains infinite truth and insight.

Third, the Comintern in Northeast Asia has already been organized and established in Outer Mongolia. The only task of the Comintern is to form a "pro-Soviet buffer zone" composed of Korea, Mongolia, and the Northeast of our country. This work is currently being actively carried out. The mutiny in South Korea this time is echoing each other with the communist bandits in the Northeast launching an offensive against Changchun and Jinzhou, which is a step in their execution of this task. We must not take it lightly and only regard it as an internal political struggle in Korea.

In short, since the communist forces have invaded Southeast Asian countries, and are now launching an offensive in Northeast Asia, coupled with the expansion of the communist bandits' rebellion in China, it fully demonstrates the depth and seriousness of the crisis in Asia. For the sake of their own survival, Asian countries should become aware of this as soon as possible, unite together, and quickly formulate a major plan for self-defense and regeneration. Even countries related to Asia, especially Britain and the United States, even if not for the sake of Asian peace, but for their own interests, should take a broad and long-term view, re-examine their foreign policy, and make plans to "mend the fold after the sheep is lost" as soon as possible.

Guilin [This Newspaper, 22nd] A rush to purchase suddenly arose in the quiet rice market.

Brahma-Gria first ordered someone to read the full text of the draft resolution in English and French, and then began to deliver a lengthy speech in Spanish, reviewing the neutral countries' mediation of the disputes among the four powers. Brahma-Gria said that the neutral countries had always carried out mediation work with perseverance and had created an atmosphere of harmony. He urged all member states to be frank and cooperate, and said, "What we seek is a simple, clear and practical solution. If this solution can be achieved, it will breed the hope of peace. The intention of the compromise plan is a clear and practical solution, to ease the agitated and tense emotions, and to avoid resolutions that could cause war."

[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 22nd broadcast: The six neutral countries of the Security Council formally continued to ask the four powers to end the Berlin blockade crisis and proposed a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four powers around the end of November to discuss the German question.

Acting Chairman Brahma-Gria said that the compromise plan was intended to avoid resolutions that could cause war.

### Jewish and Egyptian Armies Cease Fire in Accordance with the United Nations Deadline; United Nations Personnel Go to the Negev for Supervision

[United States News, Paris, 21st] The United Nations Acting Mediator for Palestine, Bunche, stipulated tonight that noon on the 22nd (Greenwich Mean Time) is the deadline for the ceasefire between the Israeli and Egyptian armies fighting in the Negev desert in southern Palestine.

### The United States is Determined to Safeguard Free Nations; Clay Gives a Speech

[United States Information Service, New York, 21st] General Clay gave a speech at the Smith Foundation here tonight, saying that the Soviet Union deliberately chose Berlin as a place to try to obstruct the political and economic recovery of free European countries. However, Soviet planners failed to recognize the strength of our air force, and they did not understand the determination of the Western allies to fulfill their responsibilities. With political and economic stability, the people of free European countries with self-esteem have the ability to safeguard their freedom, and they cherish this freedom. At that time, no government can force the European people to accept its will, and a minority of people who rely on external forces to seize power by means of coercion will also be replaced by governments elected by the people and responsible to the people. Before stability is ensured, we must persist in our determination to maintain peace, otherwise others will use aggressive acts to deal with defenseless people and lead to the destruction of peace. Maintaining peace means avoiding war.

He believes that this police force is a potential military organization. Clay said that although there is no obvious concentration of troops in East Germany, the police force is expanding every day. He told reporters that, as far as he knows, there is no preparation or movement in the Soviet occupation zone to indicate that the Soviet Union is preparing for war. After holding the press conference, Clay went to the White House to report to President Truman on the Berlin situation. This afternoon he met with the National Security Council.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] President Truman recently approved General Clay's request for additional aircraft to strengthen the Berlin airlift on the eve of the six member states of the Security Council putting forward another compromise plan for the Berlin issue. Clay visited the President this morning to report on the Berlin situation. The President instructed Clay to request additional C54 transport aircraft for the airlift. Currently, there are more than 200 American aircraft carrying out the Berlin airlift.

### Berlin Municipal Government Splits

[United Press, Berlin, 22nd] Western Allied officials predicted on the 22nd that even if the Soviet Union lifts the blockade, the split of the Berlin municipal government will continue unchanged. Since the beginning of the blockade, the Soviet Union has been taking steps to split the city into eastern and western parts. Allied officials believe that there is little hope of reversing the situation. Even if more extensive problems can be solved, there will be many difficulties in restoring the political situation in Berlin as it was. Today's Berlin has two police systems, two major trade unions, and two currencies. Communist mobs forced the municipal council to withdraw from the city hall located in the Soviet zone and move to the British zone, and the Soviet Union declared all actions after the relocation illegal. It is expected that the final split will occur during the city elections held according to the Western plan on December 5. The Soviet Union does not allow elections to be held in its zone, and even if a new municipal government is established, eastern Berlin will definitely not recognize it. Berlin communists have learned the techniques of the Soviet occupation zone and are also preparing a "people's government," just waiting to take the stage.

The General Assembly advocated electing Greek representative Spiropoulos, while the Security Council advocated electing Indian representative Rau.

### Local Rebellion in Southern Korea; Can Be Quelled in a Few Days; Government Forces Recapture Yeosu at 1 AM Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 22nd] Yeosu, where 2,500 security forces launched a mutiny, was recaptured by government troops at 2 AM this morning. Therefore, the date for the resolution of the South Korean rebellion should be earlier than expected. Syngman Rhee told reporters this morning: The situation in Yeosu is safe and sound, and the restoration of security in other areas is only a matter of days. A Korean government spokesman confirmed today that senior government military officers, including Commander-in-Chief Song Hu, had flown south from Seoul on nine transport aircraft to command the operation. The naval defense forces are now guarding the sea off Yeosu to prevent the rebels from escaping by sea. It is also heard that rebellions have also occurred in other places, but this has not yet been confirmed.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 22nd] The local armed anti-government disturbances that occurred on the Yeosu Peninsula in southernmost Korea the day before yesterday have now been suppressed by government forces. According to the government information office, the disturbances affected Yeosu, Suncheon, Gwangju, Namwon, and other places, and order has now been restored in Suncheon. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense issued Public Announcement No. 1 at 2 pm on the 22nd: "On the 20th of this month, the 14th Regiment stationed in Yeosu launched a mutiny. The Masan troops stationed in Gwangju have now been ordered to rush to Yeosu to suppress the unrest. The Jiri Mountains have been surrounded by a commando team. The rebellion can be quelled. We hope that the people will stay at their posts." According to the ministry, the mutiny was instigated by the North Korean People's Republic, which can be proved by the fact that they raised the Korean flag during the operation. The reason for launching the operation at this time may be to commemorate the Soviet "October Revolution."

[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Korean Minister of Home Affairs Yoon Chi-young predicted on the 21st that the Communist-launched attempt to overthrow the government could be "defeated" in four or five days. Police forces loyal to the government have dispatched nine small aircraft to search for the remaining troops of the rebels. These aircraft were previously borrowed from the United States and are piloted by Koreans.

Both men had combat experience in Poland and Germany, but had no previous contact with the West.

### Tokyo Tribunal to Reopen Next Month; Japanese Class A War Criminals Will Be Convicted; Verdict Exceeds 3,000 Pages

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] According to reliable sources close to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, at least three judges in the International Military Tribunal made it clear that their attitudes were contrary to the opinions of the entire tribunal, and they may not agree with the final judgment currently being prepared by the majority of the judges. But he also pointed out that the contrary opinions of a very small number of judges based on English, American and French law are not enough to diminish the power and effect of the judgment of the majority of judges. The judgment of the majority of judges on the 25 Japanese war criminals will still be the legal final conviction. The person also said that the final verdict has not yet been completed, so the military tribunal cannot open on November 1 as announced by the Secretary General of the tribunal yesterday, and the date of the tribunal's reopening is likely to be in mid-November.

He also told reporters that the completed final verdict will be a document exceeding 3,000 pages. Among them, 1,300 pages are the verdict drafted by the majority of the judges, and 400 pages are appendices. Another 1,300 pages are the statements of the judges with dissenting opinions, but only the legal final verdict of the majority of the judges on the Japanese Class A war suspects will be read in the court, and the rest will be filed again and will not be read publicly. It will take eight or nine days to read the verdict before announcing the sentences of the defendants.

### The Government Can Purchase and Distribute Registered Raw Materials and Daily Necessities; The Social Affairs Bureau Orders Manufacturers to Register Finished Product Inventory

[This newspaper's dispatch] The Supervisor's Office announced last night: For the goods that the city's industry and commerce registered with the Social Affairs Bureau for the first time, if necessary, the government can purchase the raw materials and daily necessities and distribute them to factories and citizens at a limited price. At the same time, all manufacturers and wholesalers must register their inventory of finished products with the Social Affairs Bureau and must not hide them. These inventories include wool fabrics, cotton fabrics, knitted fabrics, soap, cigarettes, rubber products, etc. The Social Affairs Bureau will issue a formal notice today, and registration will begin before the 27th. Those who hide them will be confiscated. The Supervisor's Office has also sent a letter to the municipal government, asking it to check underground warehouses during the general household registration check.

It is reported that the reason why the responsible authorities have taken the above-mentioned strict measures is because they firmly believe that there is no shortage of materials in Shanghai, but most of them are hidden by merchants, waiting for prices to rise. The Shanghai Economic Control Supervisor's Office also sent a letter to the municipal government asking it to instruct manufacturers to supply goods. The original letter stated: The purpose of the general registration of the city's main daily necessities is to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding goods and to understand the inventory of manufacturers. In the past ten days, a few merchants have believed that the goods that have been registered have been registered and obtained the government's recognition, so they can wait and see, and are unwilling to sell them on the market, which is a great loss of the meaning of the general registration. We should send a letter to you to check and instruct all manufacturers to supply the market as much as possible with the goods that have been registered to maintain the normal operation of the market. The municipal government has recently instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct all industries to comply.

On June 3 of this year, after being discovered by the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Finance transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for prosecution.

### Prosecuted for Hoarding Yarn, Cloth, Soap, and Candles

[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Procuratorate recently prosecuted three cases of hoarding for speculation: (1) Rong Bingsheng, the warehouse director of Shenxin No. 2 Factory, along with factory director Wang Yinzhan and personnel section chief Li Yaoting, jointly purchased twenty-one bales of Jin Shuang Ma brand cotton yarn in March of this year. They stored them in the factory's No. 5 warehouse and did not offer them for sale on the market. When the currency reform took place in August and the government strictly enforced economic controls, the city implemented warehouse inspections. The defendants disobeyed the order to report and register the yarn, and instead transferred it to the No. 4 warehouse. They covered it with hemp sacks and waste cotton in an attempt to evade inspection. On the afternoon of September 27th, Rong Bingsheng ordered workers to take out the stored yarn, intending to load it onto a ship for external transport. This was met with dissatisfaction by worker Chen Dahong, who secretly reported it to the Putuo Police Sub-bureau, which then investigated and uncovered the case.

(2) Gu Weiliang from Haimen and Li Biaoyuan from Guangdong are both without legitimate occupations. On the morning of the 7th of this month, they came to Shanghai from Nanxiang. They acquired sixteen bolts of striped bedding cloth and fourteen bolts of printed cloth in the Wuma Road area. They divided the cloth between two bicycles and transported it back to Nanxiang for hoarding. In order to evade inspection, they took small roads, passing through Nan Lu and Taopu Road. As a result, they were apprehended by plainclothes police officers.

(3) Cao Youtang from Cixi hoarded thirty-one boxes of soap, four boxes of foreign candles, six cans of vegetable oil, and two jars of spirits for more than four years without offering them for sale. The Huangpu Police Sub-bureau discovered the hoard.

### Pigs Destined for Shanghai Detained in Yangzhou: Merchants Request Authorities to Intervene for Release

### Real Estate Transactions Stalled, Building Materials Difficult to Purchase, Affecting Housing Construction Movement

[Our Newspaper's Report] Real estate transactions in this city have noticeably entered a standstill in recent weeks. While asking prices continue to rise, transactions have slowed down. This is because building materials are difficult to buy, making housing construction extremely difficult, thus weakening the demand for vacant land. Generally, sellers, amidst a strong buying frenzy, continue to raise prices. For example, vacant land on Yuyuan Road near Jiangsu Road is being priced as high as 150,000 yuan per mu, but there is a lack of buyers, resulting in a de facto stalemate. It is reported that those with idle funds are increasingly turning to alleyway properties that are already occupied, as prices are relatively lower. For example, a recent transaction for alleyway properties opposite the Hankou Road Securities Building was only 220,000 yuan per mu (including the buildings on the land). It is estimated that if the land were vacant, it would be worth 450,000 yuan per mu.

Furthermore, it is reported that due to the strict price controls recently implemented in the city, the supply of building materials such as cement, bricks, tiles, yellow sand, and gravel has also become scarce, which is affecting housing construction in the city. It is reported that the Shanghai Real Estate Association is encouraging its members to continue building new houses in support of the authorities' "Ten Thousand Houses" movement. The first batch of new housing construction organized collectively by the members has already designated a site on Dunxin Road, where it is planned to build thirty-three detached houses, each forty feet deep, and either fourteen feet or eighteen feet wide. The materials for this batch of houses have mostly been secured, and it is expected that all will be completed by December of next year. In addition, members of the association are also building new residential houses separately, with one project on Daxilu consisting of twelve detached houses, and another at 76 Jessfield Road, planning to build over one hundred detached houses. The materials for the former project have mostly been secured, while the latter is still in the planning stage.

### Fresh Fish Shipped to Shanghai Flows into the Black Market: Four Reasons Analyzed for Fish Shortage: Fishing Boats Lack Rice and Diesel

The fish shortage in this city is becoming increasingly serious. The Supervisor's Office and the Police Bureau have convened three meetings with the fishing industry in recent days and are now carefully studying how to remedy the situation. According to the fishing industry, the reasons for the fish shortage are as follows: (1) Half of the fishing boats have stopped working due to a shortage of rice and reduced allocations of diesel fuel. (2) Many freshwater fish being transported to Shanghai are intercepted en route, and those that do arrive are mostly flowing into the newly emerging black markets in Nanxiang, Fangjia Yao, and Caojiadu, evading regulations. (3) The export of salted and dried fish is prohibited in the production areas. (4) In the past, over twenty pairs of fishing boats from North China regularly supplied Shanghai, but they have now disappeared because it is no longer profitable. The fishing industry urgently hopes that the authorities will quickly resolve the above-mentioned difficulties.

### Ministry of Agriculture Director Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Reorganizing the Fish Market

### Clothing Stores Prevent Panic Buying, Approve Purchase Restrictions Based on Certificates

[Our Newspaper's Report] Because wool, cotton cloth, and silk clothing materials are difficult to buy and subject to purchase restrictions, panic buying has spread to clothing stores on Shilu Road. The Clothing Industry Association submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau appealing to it, stating that the source of clothing for the industry is from goods that have reached the end of their term at pawnshops. Currently, pawnshop business is far from what it used to be, the source of supply has decreased, and it is impossible to purchase new clothing materials. They requested restrictions on customer purchases. The Social Affairs Bureau has approved limiting each person to purchasing one long garment or one short suit based on a certificate.

### Man and Woman Traveling by Car, Hiding Pockets Full of Gold, Seized and Sent to the National Bank for Exchange

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 8:40 AM yesterday, the Hongqiao Road Chengjiaqiao Economic Inspection Station inspected vehicles passing through. A private car (license plate number 04-0604) heading to the suburbs contained one man and one woman. During the inspection, it was discovered that the two appeared flustered. A detailed search revealed two cloth bags in the woman's handbag, containing a large amount of gold, including eighty American and Japanese gold coins, ten American silver dollars, sixteen Japanese gold coins, four American small gold coins, two American small gold corners, one five-tael gold bar, and six large and small gold nuggets (weighing a total of nine taels, five fen, and four li).

### Case of Murder at Xuhui Public School Solved: Janitor Loyal to His Duties, Hated and Killed by Thieves: Three Perpetrators Arrested and Confess

[Our Newspaper's Report] Fei Wenquan, the janitor of Xuhui Public School in Xujiahui, Husi, was on duty at approximately 1:30 AM on the 15th when four thugs rushed in from the darkness. They took out ropes, tied up Fei, took a Boy Scout knife, and repeatedly slashed his neck and other parts, killing him on the spot, as detailed in this newspaper. Afterwards, the school authorities reported the situation to the Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau. Zhang, the head of the bureau, ordered Yuan Jie, the chief of the criminal division, along with Patrolman Zhang Wenyuan, and officers Jiang Bin, Wang Jianping, and Wei Jintang, to rush to the scene at night to investigate the truth. They summoned other janitors, Huang Guangyuan and Ruan Youqing, for questioning. According to Ruan Youqing, a fireman named Xu Fengbiao had conspired with others on the night of September 21st to steal four shi of white rice from the school, which they put in sacks. Two shi had already been taken over the wall, and the remaining two shi were left inside the wall. Someone discovered them, and they immediately fled. The incident was reported to Yang, the director of general affairs, who reported it to the police bureau for investigation. In addition, water pens and clothing were frequently stolen from rooms B, C, and the self-study rooms, as well as the dean's office.

It was observed that this group of thieves was very familiar with the routes in the school, so it was determined that it was an inside job. After Fei Wenquan was killed, a white running shoe was found that the criminal had dropped while escaping over the wall. After examination, it was determined that this shoe may have been worn by Shen Hongdao, a worker who had been dismissed in mid-August. It was suspected that Fei's murder was committed by Xu and others. Based on the above points, police personnel began their investigation. They first summoned Zhu Liansheng, Xu Fengbiao's brother-in-law, for questioning to find out where Xu was. It was said that Xu was now a laborer in a certain warehouse, lived in Xiangqiao, Taicang, and had several relatives and friends in Shanghai. Chief Yuan obtained this clue and sent Patrolman Zhang to lead police officers Ling Xian and Chuan Peiying to Taicang, Xu's hometown, and Kunshan, his sister's home, to arrest him, but they found nothing. At the same time, more officers were dispatched to Shanghai to track him down, but there were no leads. Later, another secret report was received, stating that this group of criminals was hiding in the home of a fellow villager of Xu, surnamed Lu, who repaired foreign umbrellas for a living in Yangjialou, Hongqiao Road. The police officers were then dispatched to question Lu. They then found Xu's name on the worker roster at the Transportation Department of the Hongkou Materials Supply Bureau, knowing that he lived at 93 Zhangqiao Road, Qimei Road. At 2:00 AM on the 20th, officers were dispatched and沈鴻道(Shen Hongdao) was arrested. During interrogation, he confessed to helping kill Fei, and also said that Xu Fengbiao and others were hiding at Baziqiao, Shuidian Road, Zhabei. Police officers were dispatched again, but they had left four hours earlier. After further investigation, it was learned that Xu

was extremely cunning and had moved four times in five days. Until the afternoon of the 20th, police officers Jiang Bin and Wang Jianping, who were waiting in Taicang, reported by telephone that they had learned that Xu and others had left Shanghai and were hiding in the home of Tang Fugeng in Hengtang, Kunshan City. Patrolman Zhang was then dispatched alone to Kunshan, along with police officers Jiang and Wang, to rush to the Tang's home and arrest Xu Fengbiao and Cao Yongqing. Stolen goods such as water pens and绒线衫 (rongxian shan, wool sweaters) were seized. They were then escorted back to Shanghai that night and interrogated thoroughly. They all confessed without denial. Xu was the main culprit, using the military knife to commit the crime, Cao held the hemp rope, and Shen and two others who are still at large were the lookouts. As for Fei's murder, it was actually because he was loyal to his duties, which caused the thieves to hate him and commit this act.

### All Three Plans Pose Problems: Methods for Conserving Automobile Gasoline Resubmitted for Study

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The Shanghai Municipal Government has drafted plans for conserving automobile gasoline in Shanghai. In addition to vehicles that will not be cut, three additional plans were proposed for those that cannot be cut and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is now known that the Executive Yuan's Steering Committee for Conservation has reviewed each of these plans. The first plan, which would reduce 6,500 vehicles, and the second plan, which would reduce 1,500 vehicles, were considered to have serious consequences as they would lead to driver unemployment and vehicle damage. However, if the third plan, which conserves gasoline without reducing the number of vehicles, were adopted, it would violate the emergency order for financial and economic emergencies and would inevitably lead to a black market for gasoline. It was then decided to hand it over to representatives of the Ministry of Transportation and other relevant agencies to resubmit the study and then submit it to the Steering Committee for Conservation for decision.

### Revision of House Tax and Construction Tax Rates: Director of the Bureau of Finance Explains the Truth

[Reported by this Newspaper] Recently, citizens of this city received house tax payment notices from the Bureau of Finance, with the listed amounts increased by as much as five hundred times. Citizens are纷纷 inquiring with the Bureau of Finance about the truth. Tian Yongqian, Director of the Bureau of Finance, in order to clarify the truth for the citizens, stated to reporters yesterday: The current house tax directly uses the "total value of the house" (i.e., the total value of all houses) as the base for taxation, which is different from the previous base of "assessed rental value." In the past, during the concession era, the highest house tax rate, based on the assessed rental value, reached 30% (with an additional 50% surcharge), and the lowest was 13%. After the recovery of the city, the tax rate was 10% of the assessed rental value for commercial properties and 5% for residential properties. This revision changes the base to the assessed total value of the house, with a total tax rate of 1.4% (14 per thousand) for commercial properties (including both house tax and municipal construction tax) and 0.8% (8 per thousand) for residential properties, with each tax accounting for half. Therefore, the actual tax rate has been reduced. The reason this is easily misunderstood by citizens is that the house tax and municipal construction tax are collected together, and the notice only states the total amount without specifying the separate amounts. Regarding the tax rate, the resolution of the Municipal Council is that the house tax and municipal construction tax each account for half, so the burden is borne equally by the homeowner and the tenant, as stipulated. However, the house tax must be paid by the residents on behalf of the homeowner for the convenience of collection, and all of this is stipulated by the original central regulations and has not been changed. It is hoped that citizens will understand this clearly. Although the old assessed total value of houses in this city was determined through scientific and detailed procedures, omissions or discrepancies may be unavoidable. If such situations occur, it is hoped that citizens will apply to this bureau for reassessment and re-evaluation to ensure fairness. However, before the reassessment, it is hoped that all house tax and construction tax will be paid in advance. Director Tian also stated that it is estimated that there are over 200,000 households in the suburbs, rural areas, and urban areas of this city, and the collection of house tax and construction tax may amount to over 3 million gold yuan. However, whether the budgeted amount can be fully collected is difficult to predict at this time.

### Influx of Floating Capital into Guangzhou Creates a Tempestuous Situation

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liang Feng

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 20th] The golden autumn is originally the most lovely season in southern China. There is a saying in the business community here: "The fifth month is poor, the sixth is beautiful, and the seventh month brings a rebound," meaning that everything comes to life in the autumn. Unfortunately, this year, a storm in late autumn unexpectedly stirred up a tempest in the market. General prices have soared, rising three to four times compared to "August 19th." The speed of this price increase and the chaos in the market are unprecedented compared to previous inflationary periods before the currency reform. Ordinary citizens are naturally living in fear, and the authorities responsible for economic control are also finding it difficult to cope. The Special Price Review Committee has not held a meeting for one or two weeks, probably because the market is too chaotic and they cannot evaluate prices.

A Terrible Loophole

Originally, the general situation had been relatively stable for a month and a half after the currency reform, and the wave of panic buying had not yet reached Guangzhou. Chairman Song Ziwen had already considered the problem of floating capital flowing south. As early as September 7th, he announced measures to restrict remittances. However, there was still a loophole: after the currency reform, the Ministry of Finance revoked the previous restrictions on carrying national currency south. This made it difficult to restrict remittances, while the carrying of gold yuan was still free. As a result, the Guangzhou Management Office had to immediately telegraph the Ministry of Finance, urging the swift implementation of a restriction on passengers traveling south, limiting each person to carrying no more than one thousand gold yuan. However, official correspondence takes time. Before this measure was implemented, those perceptive merchants from Shanghai, Wuhan, Hunan, and Jiangxi took advantage of this opportunity, carrying large amounts of floating capital that could not find a way out, and flocked south along the Yuehan Railway. As a result, the high-end hotels here were completely full, and the restaurants and dance halls were crowded with these "outsider" big spenders. Some, with connections, smuggled this floating capital to Hong Kong. Those who could not, rushed to buy goods in Guangzhou. They did not care about prices at all, only seeking to grab goods, from many to few, from large to small, scavenging everywhere and even extending to the surrounding four rural counties. With such an influx of floating capital, how could the Guangzhou industry and commerce, which was already on the verge of suffocation, resist? As a result, general store owners, seeing these big spenders, desperately increased prices, and some even closed their doors to avoid customers. Some of this floating capital could not buy goods and instead started buying foreign currency, causing a sharp reaction in the market, and the black market for currency revived. The market began to stir up about two or three days before National Day, and in less than half a month, general black market prices had risen more than three times.

The Existence of Black Market Price Differences

Because there was a black market price difference between the gold yuan and the Hong Kong dollar, the cost of goods in general became increasingly divergent from the official prices set. Guangzhou is a consumer market, and all goods rely on the surrounding four rural counties for supply. The government's strict enforcement of price controls caused goods from the surrounding rural areas to be hesitant to arrive. Merchants, seeing the source of goods become scarce, were reluctant to release their stock. In addition, some unconscionable merchants took the opportunity to hoard goods and manipulate the market, resulting in a peculiar shortage of daily necessities. Except for rice, which was relatively stable, other items such as cooking oil, firewood, pork, lamb, fish, and vegetables were almost extinct in the market. As a result, housewives have been lamenting for days that there is no food to buy, leading the ignorant citizens to believe that the enemy's army is about to invade. People are agitated, and a general atmosphere of fear prevails, which has created a serious problem for the managing authorities.

Speculators Have Opportunities to Take Advantage

According to experts, this drastic fluctuation in finance and prices is due to: (1) the postponement of the exchange of foreign currency, giving financial speculators an opportunity; (2) the impact of the war; (3) rampant smuggling; (4) hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants; and (5) the failure of government price controls to coordinate with commodity regulation. Chairman Song further pointed out that the main reason for the rise in prices is that the exchange rate of the gold yuan is too different from the original black market rate of foreign currencies in Guangzhou, and the government stipulates that the prices of "August 19" should be the standard, so the rise in black market prices is "unavoidable."

The managing authorities have formulated or implemented the following measures to address the current poor situation. In terms of finance: (1) Vigorously curb the southward flow of floating capital; (2) Private radio stations and telecommunications disrupting finance and buying and selling foreign currency are all punishable by death; (3) Employees in the gold and silver industry are not allowed to hold foreign currency from October 15th; (4) Incoming merchants are strictly inspected at airports, ships, hotels, and trading houses, and any foreign currency found is exchanged for gold yuan. Anyone found with more than one thousand yuan will be detained. In terms of commodity prices: (1) Coordinate commodities in various regions; (2) Restrict the external transport of commodities; (3) Strengthen control of grain; (4) Distribute daily necessities in advance; (5) Register inventory and inspect warehouses; (6) Strictly crack down on unscrupulous merchants; (7) Order stores not to close without reason; (8) Strengthen anti-smuggling efforts.

"The Way of Benevolence" and the Reality

The above measures can be said to be a remedy for the symptoms, and the plan can be said to be well-rounded. The operating personnel can also be said to have made the greatest efforts. Chairman Song has replied to the five legislators of the Legislative Yuan, denying the accusation that he is not effective in implementing the emergency economic plan. However, some people still believe that although Song has worked hard and his plan is thorough, the implementation of various plans is not quick and strict enough. They believe that Song's "way of benevolence" is not enough to solve the current problem. It is said that Song once summoned the leaders of the financial industry in the city and severely warned them. Huo Shishu also announced on the spot that he had cracked down on more than 30 private radio stations and seized a lot of evidence of black market trading. If everyone does not make every effort to curb the black market, he will never be lenient. At that time, Director Li of the police bureau was also present. Everyone was so scared that they were sweating profusely. However, after the meeting, the financial black market activities resumed as usual. Therefore, people generally believe that although using harsh penalties in a chaotic world is not necessarily the best way. Since the currency reform in Guangzhou, although hundreds of cases of disrupting finance and violating price limits have been detected, few have been severely punished, which is somewhat suspected of condoning unscrupulous merchants!

Turning Nothing into Something

However, looking at it from another perspective, the formation of this market chaos is of course the responsibility of the government, but according to the actual situation, the general public should also bear a great responsibility. On the one hand, the objective situation has caused drastic price fluctuations, and the unsound psychology of the people is most likely to affect the implementation of all operating measures. In the past, during currency inflation, it is not surprising that people discriminated against national currency, but after the issuance of the gold yuan, it not only had full reserves, but also the issuance has not yet reached the full amount, so there is no reason for inflation, and commodities have not really been lacking. The situation is definitely not as serious as people think. However, the general public is creating trouble for themselves, rushing to buy, making general merchants holding goods think that they can make a killing. They stop selling and close down, so turning nothing into something. In fact, everyone should calm down a bit, understand the facts, and take out their conscience to assist the government in consolidating economic control and maintaining a stable life!

Qiongya Anti-Traitor Association Established

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Haikou, 19th] The Qiongya Anti-Traitor Association was reorganized and established on the 17th of this month.

The predecessor of the association was the Qiongya Committee for Reporting Corruption from All Walks of Life, which was originally organized by people from this island traveling to the provincial capital. Later, because the people in charge returned to Qiong one after another, the association was established in this city, and it has made repeated achievements in cracking down on corruption and clarifying officialdom.

### Chongqing High Court Youyang Branch First Investigates Zhang Zhenyin's Wrongful Case: Ministry of Justice Ordered to Strictly Handle It; Gelaohui Gang Will Be Cleared Up

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Li Chongfu, President of the Youyang Branch of the Sichuan High Court, took advantage of the remote location of Youyang to traffic in opium and even allowed his wife, Ms. Sun, to openly operate opium dens. Last August, Shi Keming and other residents of the township filed a complaint with Zhang Zhenyin, the chief prosecutor of the court, requesting a strict investigation. Zhang sent police on the 23rd of the same month to search the residence of Li's wife Sun, accompanied by the保甲 (local security force). They found opium pipes, lamps, and ash on Li's wife Sun's bed. They arrested Li's wife Sun and the opium den operator. While the case was being investigated, Zhou Bilu, the chief prosecutor of the Youyang Local Court, Wang Degui, the president of the court, and other members of Li's Gelaohui gang colluded with the county government of the special commissioner's office. When Zhang was interrogating Li's wife Sun, they instigated twenty to thirty thugs, including Li's sons and nephews, to snatch Li's wife Sun away, making it impossible to pursue the case. The next day, they dragged Zhang out of the house, beat him until he was injured, and the special commissioner's office sent more than twenty soldiers, armed with guns, to escort Zhang to the Youyang County Police Bureau for detention and interrogation. The soldiers then escorted him to the prosecutor's office of the local court, falsely accusing Zhang of disturbing public order and arbitrarily detaining him, and assigning ten soldiers to guard him for four days and nights. At the same time, many of Li's female relatives dragged Zhang's wife to the street, insulted her, tore her clothes, and took away her gold jewelry. Zhang was helpless and had to endure their violence and insults. Later, due to the indignation of the party groups and various organizations of the Youyang County Assembly, Zhang was released, while Li's wife Sun remained at large, openly smoking opium as usual. It was so dark and without light. After Zhang regained his freedom, he reported the injustice to the higher authorities last September, requesting a thorough investigation. The Ministry of Justice ordered the Sichuan High Court to transfer it to the Chongqing Branch to send someone to Youyang for a thorough investigation. However, the investigator was surrounded by Li's party and was unable to handle the case impartially. The investigator only considered it as a dispute between the court and the prosecutor's office and requested that personnel be adjusted. Recently, the President received another report, confirming that Zhang was earnestly handling the opium prohibition case in accordance with national policy. The report stated that he was insulted and detained by lower-level judicial officials colluding with administrative personnel, which was extremely outrageous. The President immediately ordered the Ministry of Justice to conduct a thorough investigation and handle the matter strictly in accordance with the law. In addition, the Law Officer Training Institute of the Judicial Yuan, Chaoyang College, and the students and villagers from Yixing, Jiangsu, in Beijing all expressed their indignation and repeatedly appealed to the authorities for justice, providing strong moral support.

### A Glimpse into the Yixing Pottery Kilns

— Our Correspondent, Zhu Xianggao

[Our Yixing Dispatch, 14th] It is undeniable that Chinese farmers are more hardworking and resilient than any other people in the world. They are the stalwarts of the land, not only toiling in agricultural production as adults, but also making full use of their agricultural off-season to engage in side occupations. Their lives are simple and honest, creating a fine tradition for centuries. Taking my hometown of Yixing as an example, in addition to a fertile farmland, the agricultural off-seasons of spring and winter are of great significance to them. By-products have a deeply rooted foundation in the countryside, such as spinning cotton, raising silkworms, and making grass paper—among which, pottery production is the most prominent. Speaking of pottery, the people of Yixing proudly say that it is a rare specialty. Since it represented national products at the Canadian Exposition in earlier years and was awarded the highest prize, it has become famous at home and abroad. Yixing pottery is used for decoration in luxurious living rooms. Although it is considered a treasure by foreigners, just like Jingdezhen porcelain, it has been shackled by a lack of progress and adherence to old ways. It has not been able to compete for a large amount of foreign exchange in the international market. In an era of rapid scientific advancement, although China's handicrafts cannot be said to have declined completely, they are at least on a downward slope. The current situation of Yixing's pottery kilns illustrates the serious crisis that Chinese handicrafts are facing in this era of rapid scientific progress.

Ding and Shu Towns

This time, the reporter accompanied local reporters on a special boat. At about 9 a.m., the motorboat entered the Jiu River from the inland river. The vast expanse of blue waves was dotted with sailboats, stretching as far as the eye could see. Before the war, the government had planned to renovate the east and west Jiu Rivers into parks, but shortly after, the incident occurred. Now, there is naturally nothing to talk about. Otherwise, if carefully organized, it could be compared to West Lake. At about 11 a.m., we arrived at Shushan Town, disembarked, and walked to Dingshan Town to inspect the pottery kilns in person. As early as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, Fan Li took Xi Shi to live in seclusion in the county and called himself Tao Zhugong. Yixing pottery making has since been known to the world, which, calculating from Fan Li, has a history of more than 2,000 years. The reporter and a group of more than 20 people first inspected the raw materials for making pottery, located behind the streets of Ding and Shu towns. There are three hills in total, each covering an area of ​​tens of acres and reaching a height of ​​thirty to fifty zhang. Xilong Mountain is located to the west, and is commonly known as West Mountain. Huanglong Mountain is located to the east, and is commonly known as East Mountain. Together with Benshan, they form a tripod, hence the name Dingshan. Located at the foot of Shushan Mountain, it is named Shushan Town.

White Clay Field

The above-mentioned mountains produce green, yellow, purple, and various other colored soils. In addition, there is a solitary mountain more than 20 li away from Dingshan that specializes in producing white clay, commonly known as the White Clay Field, which is the source of all raw materials for making blanks. First, the soil is transported from the mountainous area, and then crushed with a stone roller by animal power. After grinding, the fineness of the powder is determined, and it is divided into coarse, fine, black, and yellow sand, according to grade, for making jars, urns, pots, and even delicate tea sets, which require the finest clay. After the water is mixed evenly, it can be handed over to technicians to make various pottery blanks according to the model. Then, it is transported to the drying yard to be blown by the wind. Once it is completely dry, it is glazed, and soon it can be loaded into the kiln, which is the most important juncture of the entire project. The kilns are like centipedes of various lengths and sizes, undulating and stretching continuously, hidden in the mountains and ridges, and are called Dragon Kilns by the people of Ding and Shu. Except for the lower entrance, which is the formal kiln opening, there is only one round hole at the bottom, which is the outlet for all flue gas and ash. On the left and right of the back, kiln windows are dug opposite each other every two feet. When the pottery blanks enter the kiln, they are stacked according to size, just like arranging jars and urns in layers, and even tea sets, placing them sequentially from the bottom to the opening. Then, the round holes in the back are closed with mud. If the kiln is loaded with coarse goods, pine branches and firewood are used, and if it is loaded with fine goods, thatch is used. The burning begins at the kiln opening.

Fire Watching Technicians

The success or failure of the entire kiln depends on whether the fire is used appropriately. Skilled workers must stay and watch the fire day and night. After a certain period of time, the kiln door is sealed with mud, and the first pair of window holes on the left and right of the back are opened. Fuel is burned in the first pair of holes, gradually moving upwards in sequence, until the last pair of window holes. Each medium-sized kiln takes about one day and night to stop burning, and then it takes two days to cool the kiln before the goods can be taken out. From the beginning to the end of this entire project, the categories of procedures are deeply divided and the boundaries are clearly defined, without any confusion. For example, a worker who makes urine pot blanks can only make urine pot blanks for the rest of his life. He cannot make anything else. Among all the technicians, the fire watching workers are the most important, because their work is crucial and related to the success or failure of the entire kiln. The living standards of all workers are quite high, and the fire watching technicians are the most well-off. On average, each person can get seven dou of white rice per day, and the rest of the workers have at least four dou. The ownership of the Dragon Kiln, like the landlords in other places, is regarded as a source of livelihood. Being able to own a kiln is called the richest person. Most of them are owned jointly by three to five or even a dozen families. The success or failure of a kiln greatly affects the life of the kiln household. As the saying goes, "Three kilns poor, three kilns rich." If the kiln is not operated well, it is common to lose everything, which forces the people in the area to become superstitious. Therefore, it is no wonder that they carry a shadow of misfortune when entering the blanks. After we finished watching all the Dragon Kilns on the four mountain ridges, we rushed to Tangdu Township, about three li away from the town, to inspect the area, which is famous for producing jars at the time. The kilns are built on flat ground, and the kiln tops are covered with shades to avoid sudden rain in summer and autumn. The equipment is complete and the products are particularly good. Dingshan Town mainly produces coarse goods, such as jars, urns, and household goods. Shushan Town produces fine goods, such as tea sets and decorations. Kiln households are most nervous when firing kilns, and they must not only pay attention to the strength of the fire, but also must not allow it to be interrupted. It is said that a kiln household, when firing the kiln for the first time, could not get enough fuel due to the interruption of fuel supply. He first chopped up the doors and windows of his house, and then even sent the bedclothes and clothing into the kiln. Standing on the top of the mountain, we saw smoke billowing everywhere all day long, stretching continuously. Therefore, the air in the area is particularly dry and the air dust is very low, which is quite harmful to human life. People who come here for the first time find it extremely difficult to bear.

Pottery Industry Guild

When we visited the Pottery Industry Guild, they expressed a "sigh of regret" about the future of pottery, which is about 70% of what it was before the war. According to the guild's statistics, there are about 5,000 technicians in total, and tens of thousands more people rely on it for food and clothing. In recent times, it has been difficult to maintain a livelihood and unable to bear the huge costs. Therefore, half of the Dragon Kilns have now been abandoned and production has been sharply reduced. Famous craftsmen such as Shao Quantong have formed the Shangyuan Pot and Jar Production Cooperative to revitalize the country, raising funds of several thousand dan of rice, producing and selling themselves. There is also the Tangdu Jar Production Cooperative, which is quite large in scale. The industry regards Tao Zhugong as its ancestor and enshrines him in the Kiln God Temple on the top of this mountain. The temple is unremarkable and no different from other desolate land temples.

Ceramics School

Finally, we rushed to see the Jiangsu Provincial Ceramics School established by the Department of Education, located in the center of the Dingshu Highway, surrounded by water on three sides. The environment is very beautiful. It is said that the original school building was destroyed by artillery fire, and the Democracy Hospital is now used as the school building. The principal is Wang Shijie. There are currently 40 students, who can graduate in three years. It is said that the school is stagnant and the students have little interest in the industry. Of course, the environment is also a factor. The lack of opportunities for handicrafts has led to a downward spiral. At its peak before the war, there were more than a thousand students, divided into ordinary and specialized, who graduated in six years. Now, although Principal Wang has worked hard to manage it, it is still difficult to improve. The new model kiln designed by teachers and students on the top of Huangshan is still spewing black smoke, which can be regarded as a reflection of the pre-war prosperity. The residents of the area use lime to build houses from broken and leaking urns and porcelain, which not only makes use of waste, but is also strong and durable. This is a unique phenomenon that is rarely seen in other places.

At 2 a.m. in the middle of the night, our group inspected the urban area. It is a miracle that such a great industrial area has no electric lighting equipment. The shops are deserted, with only county gas lamps. At this late hour, pedestrians seem to be coming and going continuously. One-third of the food shops have not yet closed, and the snack stalls along the street are lined up one after another, which is much more prosperous than Yicheng. There are not too many pottery shops selling in this town, but there are especially many restaurants and wine shops. All the technicians, because of their high income, must eat and drink to their heart's content before going to work, consuming at least half of their income. There are some workers from northern Jiangsu who are naturally diligent and thrifty. Although their income is high, they still try to save money. On the other hand, the demand for consumption is also great, and the prevalence of smoking and gambling is more prevalent than in other areas and more difficult to prohibit than in other areas. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that the highway between Ding and Shu towns, about three li long, is both wide and flat, and is planted with weeping willows on both sides. Looking as far as the eye can see, the willow waves flutter, which is quite poetic and picturesque. Behind the trees, jars and porcelain are piled up like mountains, stretching endlessly. The current trend makes people feel a sense of "beauty in decline."

### The First Batch Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Early Next Month: Vietnamese and Burmese Rice Will Soon Be Shipped; National Bank Sends Telegram to President Weng to Actively Purchase Rice

[Our Dispatch] Central Bank officials revealed that our country's grain purchase quota in the Southeast Asian region totals 126,300 tons, worth US$31.68 million. Of this, rice from Inner Dha accounts for 68,000 tons, and Burmese rice accounts for 60,000 tons. Most of it will be purchased with funds under US aid, but the quantity will be determined after consultation with Washington; the balance will be purchased by our government, handled by the China Trust Bureau. Part of the rice from Vietnam and Burma will soon be shipped, and the first batch will arrive in Shanghai early next month.

According to further inquiries by the reporter, Central Bank officials have telegraphed President Weng, actively proceeding to purchase foreign rice. The telegram mainly included three points: (1) The third phase of US aid rice should be expedited. (2) The government should allocate foreign exchange to purchase 15,000 tons of rice from Burma and 4,000 tons from Annam; the Burmese rice portion will be settled in pounds sterling. (3) Please forward a telegram to Song Ziwen, asking him to assist in the purchase of Vietnamese and Burmese rice, so that it can be successful as soon as possible.

### Rice Arrivals Increase; Market Trading Still Did Not Open Yesterday

Rice arrivals increased. Yesterday, the South Market reported a total of 1,070 shi, including 645 shi from rice stores, 85 shi from rice mills, 95 shi from sales agents, and 245 shi from rice firms. The North Market reported 704 shi from rice stores, 360 shi from sales agents, 213 shi from rice firms, and 462 shi from rice mills. Non-industry arrivals were 178 shi, totaling 1,917 shi. The two markets together totaled 2,987 shi of arrivals. Market trading still did not open. Market quotations included several types such as white japonica, thin rice, and special japonica, all priced at the original prices.

The miscellaneous grain market was stagnant yesterday. The allocation of soybeans has been temporarily suspended because the proceeds from the sales of goods allocated in previous days have not been received from the tofu industry, so it is expected that allocation will continue today. Sesame, raw peanuts, and other miscellaneous grains were not opened.

### Tight Credit Conditions Slightly Eased

Yesterday morning, credit conditions in the market were still tight. General overnight rates were still between 6.5 yuan and 7 yuan per thousand yuan, but because several Chinese commercial banks had obtained interbank loans from foreign banks, the supply was more abundant. At the same time, the rush to purchase has gradually subsided. After the merchants sold their goods, they were unable to replenish them, and they released their cash for high interest rates while the dark interest rate was high.

[Our Dispatch] Recently, the high dark interest rates in South China have caused a large outflow of funds from this city. The reporter inquired with the Anti-Smuggling Section of the Jianghai Customs yesterday about the investigation of passengers carrying cash. According to reports, the customs only announced and implemented the regulation limiting each passenger traveling to Guangdong to carry 1,000 yuan on the 21st, so there were no restrictions before the announcement. However, in the past few weeks, no incidents of carrying large amounts of cash southward have occurred. It is said that passengers transporting cash mostly take the Yuehan Railway southward.

### Assisting Post Offices in Allocating Treasury Funds

The National Treasury Bureau Announces Four Measures

The National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank has recently issued a circular to all branches and offices, stating that in order to assist post offices in allocating treasury funds, four measures were previously stipulated. Now, in order to assist the Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank in allocating the difference between the total deposits received and paid, it is also permitted to handle according to the previous measures.

The four measures for assisting post offices in allocating treasury funds are as follows: (1) When post offices need to request the bank to assist in allocating the difference between the total deposits received and paid, they should list the funds received and paid on behalf of the treasury and send them to the district treasury for verification, and the bank will allocate them free of charge. (2) The allocation area is limited to within this district, and cannot be allocated from District A to District B. (3) The number of allocations is limited to once per month. (4) The request for allocation period is limited to two months, and overdue requests will be considered abandoned.

### Foreign Exchange Transferred and Deposited by Money Shops Can Be Allocated to Increase Capital in Cash

[Our Dispatch] According to the financial authorities, the foreign exchange transferred and deposited by money shops with the National Bank is no different from the people who hold gold and banknotes and go to the National Bank to exchange them for gold yuan notes. Therefore, the foreign exchange transferred and deposited can be allocated to the cash portion of the capital increase. The authorities have convened a meeting of money shop representatives to discuss this matter, and there should be no problems in its implementation.

### Strong Buying Interest in Export Tea

Yesterday, the inland sales of fancy Tianjin tea were still stagnant due to difficult transportation. However, sales in this street and the areas of Su, Xi, and Chang continued to be good, so the market atmosphere was not lonely. It is a pity that transactions were not smooth due to the scarcity of goods, but the situation was quite stable and promising.

It is reported that recently, there has been a creeping trend in various routes in Jiaxing for coarse red and green tea. Currently, Xinmao Chun Tea Firm is in negotiations with merchants from that area. As for the foreign tea market, the process continues to be like a fish in water. Although exports to foreign countries are still declining, the appetite of exporters is still strong, so the market is full of buying interest. However, the gap between the two sides in negotiations is large, and the initial opening ended in flatness.

### Taiwan Sugar Supply Scarce

Yesterday, the sugar market was still scarce in transactions. The association's allocation matters are being actively handled. Due to the discussion of registering inventory and concentrating sales among colleagues, there is no need to buy and sell again in the market, so the market situation has become deserted. The sugar refiners in this street have been selling well in the past few days due to the brisk sales of candies and pastries, and the demand is quite high. The supply of southern goods firms is decreasing day by day because the quota has not been determined.

### The China Trust Bureau Has Re-established the Group Profit-Sharing Savings Method

The China Trust Bureau has previously issued 13 issues of the group profit-sharing savings certificate. After the currency system reform, the method has been revised and approved by the Ministry of Finance for implementation.

The 14th issue of the savings certificate is scheduled to be sold simultaneously across the country starting on November 1st. 50,000 households form a group. Each depositor deposits 2 gold yuan at a time, and can be divided into two sub-households, each sub-household depositing 1 gold yuan. The first prize winner can receive 5,000 gold yuan, 5 households can each receive 200 gold yuan, and 2,500 households can receive 2 yuan. The term is 6 months, but withdrawals are not allowed.

### Dyes Banned from Export; Sales at the Door Are Unsealed on the Spot

It is reported that the customs has notified various transportation firms that dyes are temporarily prohibited from leaving the country, resulting in a weakening of the dye market yesterday, with scarce supply and demand. However, prices are still hovering at firm levels. Also, sales at the doors of various dye shops have been brisk in recent days. In addition to limiting the quantity purchased, the seals are also unsealed on the spot to avoid the malpractices of speculative purchases and hoarding.

### Sales of State-Owned Enterprise Stocks Increase

[Our Dispatch] The sales quantity of state-owned enterprise stocks has increased considerably recently. It is reported that on the 19th of this month, a total of 99,700 gold yuan were sold in the five major cities, bringing the total sales to 4,517,400 gold yuan. This includes 2,982,000 gold yuan for textile construction, 50,500 gold yuan for China Merchants Group, 1,336,700 gold yuan for China Paper, 144,200 gold yuan for China Paper, and 4,000 gold yuan for Tianjin Paper.

### Cigarettes Revolve; Soap Still Popular

The cigarette trend is declining, and colleagues are all handling inventory registration procedures. Holders of goods are not moving their inventory casually because the registration procedures have not been completed, so transactions are still taking the line of friendly relations. Daily necessities are still popular under the scarce source of supply from the factory. Recently, sales of Another Star cigarettes have still been good, and it is said that prices in other ports are very high, and vendors are still searching for purchases, and quotations are still firm.

### (Total Import and Export Value in August; Import Surplus of 240 Billion Legal Tender)

The national import and export trade figures for August have been compiled by the Directorate General of Customs. The net value of imported goods was 1,259,262,354,730 legal tender, and the net value of exported goods was 1,010,378,829,790 legal tender. The import surplus was 248,883,524,940 legal tender, an increase of more than 421.4 billion legal tender compared to the July export surplus of 172,519,746,060 legal tender.

From January to August of this year, except for July, which was an export surplus, the remaining months were all import surpluses. The import surplus figures for each month of this year are listed below in legal tender:

January import surplus: 34,173,468 yuan. February import surplus: 24,455,084 yuan. March import surplus: 304,237,834 yuan. April import surplus: 258,775,118 yuan. May import surplus: 515,602,150 yuan. June import surplus: 13,983,619 yuan. Including the above-mentioned August import surplus, and offsetting the July export surplus, the total import surplus from January to August of this year was still 211,486,506,200 legal tender.

In August, animal and animal products accounted for the largest share of exports, with a value of more than 260 billion legal tender. The second largest was cloth, with a value of more than 233.211 billion legal tender. The third largest was yarn, silk fabrics, and knitted goods, with a value of more than 119.055 billion legal tender. The fourth largest was oils and waxes, with a value of more than 100.313 billion legal tender. The fifth largest was metal and mineral products, with a value of more than 84.576 billion legal tender.

In August, machinery and tools accounted for the largest share of imports, with a value of more than 207.084 billion legal tender (similar to July). The second largest was candles, soaps, oils, fats, waxes, glues, and rosin, with a value of more than 189.981 billion legal tender (less than July). The third largest was metals and minerals, with a value of more than 133.435 billion legal tender. The fourth largest was chemical products and manufacturing, with a value of more than 102.812 billion legal tender. The fifth largest was books, maps, paper, and wooden paper, with a value of more than 100.524 billion legal tender.

### After the Truth About Yarn and Cloth Exchange, Distribution Will Gradually Decrease

The date of the next distribution of cotton cloth has not been determined, and it is feared that it will be one of the last distributions. According to the person in charge of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, once the issue of the exchange of re-spun yarn and cloth is agreed upon, it will have a major impact on the cotton cloth industry. According to the Supervisory Office, yarn mills will be able to obtain legal profits after paying processing fees for the cloth made from yarn distributed to re-processors. The same applies to the dyeing and weaving industry. The cloth will then be returned to the yarn mills and transported to the production areas or abroad to exchange for cotton. However, cotton cloth, whether retail or wholesale, will be sold at limited prices based on inventory. If it is not distributed in the future, it will eventually be sold out, and there will be no way to replenish it, resulting in many difficulties.

Also reported: The Cotton Cloth Association had originally scheduled the fourth round of distribution to private factories in the dyeing and weaving industry yesterday afternoon, but it was temporarily suspended due to technical problems with the allocation and because some of the waybills had not been collected. It is said that the allocation will be made next Monday.

(Spinning Construction Opens Yarn)

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to be suspended. The Spinning Construction Company opened yarn as usual, including 20-count Double Happiness large package at 700 yuan (blue list), and 15-count Bumper Harvest straw package at 573 yuan. 32-count Yanghe cone yarn at 787 yuan. 40-count Sunlight cone yarn at 880 yuan, 40-count three-strand Shiguang straw package at 1,030 yuan, and 40-count three-strand limited (wood yarn group industry) application, 32-count limited (electrical group C and D), and 15-count and 20-count Double Happiness limited (dyeing factory bed sheet industry) can choose any one, and applicants were very enthusiastic.

Also reported: The Inspection Committee has decided to use in advance the yarn and cloth seized in various warehouses in the city that has been hoarded for more than three months. As for the method of use, according to news from the Economic Control Supervisory Office, it will be divided into two parts, one part for distribution and one part for transportation to rice-producing areas to exchange for food. It is feared that the rumor that it will be sold off will be difficult to implement.

### Silk and Satin Desolate

Because goods from China Trust Bureau will arrive soon, the silk weaving industry is waiting for distribution of the next allocation, and people are calm. Small silk factories that have not received an allocation have limited inventory in the past. In the midst of this raw material depletion, they feel unable to maintain operations. The association is distributing only about 30 small packages, but because the source is unsustainable, the allocation amount cannot be increased either.

For export raw silk, it is said that some goods have arrived at other ports, but the opening price offered by foreign firms is not high, and deals cannot be reached. For domestic sales, silk factories still have an appetite, but holders are not willing to sell, and the market is still desolate.

Recently, many silk and satin factories have been undertaking weaving of export products with allocated raw materials. There are very few shipments of goods made from self-purchased raw materials, and it has been stipulated that domestic sales goods will be jointly distributed by the association, so each factory is no longer opening goods independently. Small silk factories have neither obtained an allocation of raw materials nor undertaken weaving, and most of them have no raw materials to weave, so there are even fewer shipments. Wholesalers have little intention of selling their inventory, and transactions are not progressing. The market is desolate.

### Part of the Purchase Price for Raw Cotton Will Be Matched with Yarn and Cloth

It is said that Mr. Weiweijing, General Manager of the Cotton Joint Purchasing Office, said that since the beginning of the purchase work at the various branches of the office, the factory has had considerable difficulty due to the impact of the price limit. In order to facilitate the purchase work, the office has decided to transport a batch of yarn and cloth stored in the city to various places and deliver it to the seller together with cash to facilitate the purchase of raw cotton.

Also, according to news from the US Aid Cotton Yarn and Cloth Joint Management Office, some of the teams dispatched by the office to various places to inspect the actual number of spindles in operation at various factories have reported their findings. This report will be used as a reference for the second batch of US cotton allocation.

### Special Price Rice for Private Elementary Schools to be Collected on the 28th

Two Hundred Party Members to Prepare Rosters

[Dahua News Agency] This month's specially allocated rice for employees of private schools in the city will be distributed directly by the Civil Food Allocation Committee because rice shops are crowded with people buying household rice. The secondary schools will collect their rice separately from the Civil Food Allocation Committee, but because there are so many elementary schools, the Civil Food Allocation Committee, lacking manpower, is asking neighboring schools to automatically prepare rosters for approximately 200 party members, affixing the school seal, and sending a representative to take the rice allocation certificates and special allocation certificates to the Civil Food Allocation Committee on the 28th of this month to pay and collect the rice.

### Hu Shih Returns to Peiping from Shanghai Yesterday; Ming Dynasty Version of "Commentary on the Water Classic" Reunited; Plans to Visit Australia Next Spring for Educational Tour

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] Hu Shih flew back to Peiping from Shanghai today and spoke to reporters about several matters: (1) Regarding the visit to Japan, he said that it was not as definite as Shao Yulin had stated. If he has time next year, he will take a trip, and Shi Jingsheng will go with him. Regarding the level of democracy in Japan, Hu Shih quoted Li Ji as saying, "Judging by the excellence of their national voting, it may be more thorough than ours." (2) He will go to Australia next March for a month to visit the seven universities there to increase his understanding of countries in the Pacific. He also wants to visit New Zealand if he has the opportunity. Hu Shih praised the democratic system and social legislation of Australia and New Zealand as being top-notch and advanced countries in the Pacific. (3) He brought back a treasure this time, namely the first half of the "Commentary on the Water Classic" from the Yongle Encyclopedia, which is treasured by the Commercial Press. Hu Shih said that this is the best and most complete rare book. The second half is in the collection of Li Xuanbo, the nephew of Li Shizeng of Gaoyang, who gave it to Peking University a few years ago. This time, the two halves are reunited and will be exhibited together with dozens of other items at the 50th anniversary of Peking University. (4) Regarding financial reforms, Hu Shih reiterated his opinion that after more than two months, the advantages and disadvantages are already apparent, and the government should immediately invite domestic experts and scholars to study and determine the reforms. Because they are not people in the speculative market, their views are free and appropriate, and he hopes that people from Peking University and Tsinghua University will participate. (5) Discussing the issue of university funding, Hu Shih said that before the currency reform, salaries accounted for 99% of the total funding. After the currency reform, the research funding for one department of the medical school was only equivalent to 7.5 US dollars, and the dean resigned because of this. Peking University has recently proposed a concrete proposal, which was approved by the president's meeting in Peking and agreed to by the Ministry of Education, and may be implemented next year. According to this proposal, salaries will account for 60% of the total funding, with the remaining 40% used for running the school, 20% for academic research, 15% for operating expenses, 3% for general lecturer fees, and 2% for miscellaneous expenses. Finally, a reporter asked Hu Shih if he had discussed the issue of the university returning to the south in Peking. Hu Shih waved his hand, saying that it is best not to talk about this matter.

Free Talk

### Feelings About Rush-Buying Tobacco by Ji Yong

These days, newspapers are rarely without talk of rush-buying, even trains are crowded. It is said that wealthy young men, fearing the loss of opportunities for timely enjoyment, are taking the opportunity to visit Suzhou and Hangzhou before prices officially skyrocket. I live in Suzhou, and sure enough, the Tiger Hill scenic area has been very lively these past few days. According to local newspaper reports today, even a high-ranking official from the Ministry of Transportation could not squeeze onto the train and had to jump in through the window of a mail car, temporarily becoming a piece of mail.

However, this is all irrelevant. My feelings arose from the two queues I saw this morning for buying rice and tobacco. Although Suzhou is a land of fish and rice, nowadays rice can only be bought by the liter. The day before yesterday, each person could be allocated five liters, but yesterday it was only two. However, the rice queue I saw this morning had two characteristics that clearly distinguished it from the tobacco queue: (1) the number of people was relatively small; (2) everyone quietly lined up and waited for the door to open, with some women taking the opportunity to knit sweaters. The tobacco queue, on the other hand, was terrible. There were at least one or two hundred people at one shop, some even standing on other people's shoulders, grabbing and snatching, with no order whatsoever. So I pondered in my heart, is smoking more important than eating? But looking at those rush-buying friends, they were definitely not "Analects" types, not one of them with a scholarly air, thinking of increasing their "spirit of smoking" with "Big Cannon Tower" cigarettes. On the contrary, most of them were working-class types, the so-called scalpers. Only then did I suddenly realize the truth: rush-buying rice is for eating, while rush-buying tobacco is for profit. There are fewer people who are buying for eating, and they are still somewhat leisurely, while there are more people who are buying for profit, and they are disregarding their lives at the same time.

Fame and fortune are inherently helpless, but when it comes to the edge of starvation, most people still tend towards profit, and this phenomenon is worth studying. Human history for thousands of years is actually a history of struggle. What is the object of struggle? In short, it is "profit"! For one's own livelihood is certainly profit, but exceeding one's own enjoyment is even greater profit. Where profit lies, there is no limit to its size, even if there is equal harm accompanying it, it is still ignored and blindly pursued. For example, every day there are people who are sued or even executed for price gouging or corruption, but this does not reduce price gouging and corruption in society. The people who are currently "gouging" and "corrupting" will not wash their hands because they are warned. They understand legal provisions better than judges in their hearts, but they cannot resist their covetousness for gold yuan and enjoyment. Someone once said that the evolution of history is quantitative rather than qualitative. People in ancient times invaded others and other tribes for their own benefit, and people today still do the same. The ancient people used spears and swords, and the modern people use tanks and airplanes, that's all. Some even say that human culture is an extension of animal culture. Animals use claws and poison to harm their own kind, while humans use various weapons to kill those of the same kind with round skulls and square feet. This statement also makes sense. Recently, someone interviewed the American scientific authority on atomic energy, Dr. Albert Einstein, and asked him what kind of weapons would be used in the Third World War. He replied humorously, "I don't know about the Third World War, but I know for sure about the Fourth." The interviewer was surprised and asked why. Einstein smiled and said, "With stones." What he meant was that three world wars would destroy all of humanity, and what is called culture would no longer exist, so the world would return to chaos, and humanity would return to its origins, so when fighting, they would have to use stones. Assuming that this is inferred, who knows whether our hundreds of thousands of years of civilization, from "Peking Man" to the atomic bomb era, had not existed a million years ago? It's just because everyone is fighting for profit, making chaos come again. It really seems like Zhuangzi said, "Suddenly a sudden one 　 Chaos of it, and Chaos died." Since humanity has had a love of profit, humanity has been doomed to perish.

It's strange, every invention is first used for war tools to protect oneself and one's own interests or to invade the interests of others. At the beginning of the Bronze Age, Guan Zhong said, "Good gold is used to cast swords, and bad gold is used to cast hoes." The hoes used for production are far less important than the swords used for killing. Nobel invented smokeless gunpowder, originally for opening mountains and mining, but unexpectedly it was used for cannons and machine guns. Einstein's atomic energy was also first tasted by Japanese devils, and now it has become a secret that the world is scrambling to seize, making this old man complain. Some people say that atomic energy will soon be used in industry, but my view is that if there is no newer weapon to replace it, there will never be a possibility of using it for production. It is today's "good gold," and only "bad gold" is used for production! It's also like how the scalpers can make the greatest effort to rush-buy tobacco, and if they have extra energy, they will use it to rush-buy rice.

If I were the authorities, I would definitely open up the sale of cigarettes, allowing the prices to rise at will, and the cigarette factories would extract a certain number of cartons every day and distribute them free of charge to writers, distributed by various publishing agencies. Otherwise, both rice and cigarettes would be price-limited, but after buying cigarettes, it would not be allowed to buy rice. However, the latter method would inevitably make it difficult for friends who like to smoke, such as Mr. Zeshi, so the first method would still be appropriate. (Editor's note: Mr. Zeshi once published an article in this column entitled "Talking About Paper," saying that tobacco has become one of the daily necessities.)

### On Vegetarianism

— Why Bother

These past few days, we have all been forced to be practitioners of vegetarianism.

Regardless of how Buddhist and health advocates promote the benefits of vegetarianism for the body, regardless of how George Bernard Shaw's longevity is attributed to his strict vegetarian diet, regardless of how moralists attack meat-eaters as base, I never believe that humans should be vegetarians and not eat meat. Therefore, these past few days of vegetarianism, we certainly feel helpless, and only hope that this abnormal situation can be cleared up as soon as possible.

Judging from the actual situation, the problem is not the scarcity of meat such as fish, chicken, and shrimp, but the abnormal supply. Why is it that many large restaurants still have fish and meat as usual, while in small vegetable markets they are extremely rare? The few that are available require queuing and waiting from six o'clock in the morning until eight o'clock before they can be bought. Each person must have a number written on their body with chalk. To put it tragically, it is like prisoners receiving rations, but this "ration" still has to be exchanged with money.

If vegetarianism is feasible, then it would be better to simply let everyone in the world eat a vitamin pill that can prevent hunger, like the legendary elixir of immortality in ancient China, and not eat human food, how pleasant and convenient would that be? In fact, in addition to filling their stomachs, humans also need to satisfy at least the minimum level of their appetite. Of course, "Yi Ya's taste is universally appreciated." We are advocating frugality in this era, not to promote the delicacies of mountains and seas, nor to teach every household to live in luxury. At the very least, people should be able to obtain some nutrition so that these already thin people have some food to replenish their strength.

When the World Games open in London, what will our athletes eat? Preserved eggs and canned food, and supposedly some ham. But compared to the food of athletes from Britain and the United States, our athletes are far behind. With poor nutritional supply, it is difficult to compete with others in the competition. However, I believe that what Chinese athletes eat overseas is still considered top-notch. Isn't it just simple meals in the country? The body's nutrition cannot be achieved overnight. If you want a strong physique, you must pay attention to nutrition, which is related to your health, from early on.

Absolute vegetarianism is as unworkable as absolute meat-eating. Usually, our food is mostly a combination of vegetarian and meat dishes, which have a mutual effect. We have an idiom in our hometown that says, "Rice is the root, meat is the branch," meaning that for a person's nutrition, meat treats the branch, and rice treats the root. Most Chinese people do not eat cod liver oil, do not get booster shots, and do not have Sanatogen and multiple vitamin pills. Their health is maintained by meat and rice alone. Therefore, my conclusion is: I do not support long-term vegetarianism!

### A Record of a Visit to the Vegetable Market

— Commentator

Because he couldn't buy the food he needed in the vegetable market, the cook hired by the group submitted his "resignation": unless someone accompanies him to buy food, he will never go to the vegetable market alone. Although colleagues felt that going to the vegetable market was troublesome, they finally decided to take turns going to the vegetable market with the cook every day: to decide what to buy and how to buy it; as for the basket, of course, the cook would carry it. In other words, the cook who carries the basket is always the same one, and the one who "partners" with him is the one on duty.

I have never been to the vegetable market to buy food, and now I have to experience the taste of going to the vegetable market as a housewife. This taste is really not very pleasant: circling between the vegetable stalls, squeezing through the crowd, walking on wet and slippery ground, smelling the fishy and smelly odors. Buying meat and fish requires "standing in line" and waiting respectfully. It is lucky to buy them. Maybe you will be pushed and squeezed and fall to the ground, which would be terrible!

After waiting in a relatively short line, I bought the fish, and then my eyes turned to the vegetables.

There are only a few kinds of vegetables! The chicken mustard is not to my liking, the cabbage has traces of insect bites, and I'm afraid the radish is hollow... Should I not buy them? How will I explain it when I get back? And what will we eat?

"Why are the good cabbages all infested with insects?" Knowing that this question is meaningless, but after flipping through the cabbage, I walked away. The reason seemed insufficient, and I was afraid of being scolded, so I took preemptive action in order to retreat safely. Unexpectedly, the vegetable stall owner calmly said, "The ones that aren't infested have all been sold! You're late!"

I turned around to leave, and the cook who was carrying the basket protested:

"Forget it, don't run around anymore, anyway, all the cabbages you find will be infested." So, I made a deal with this cabbage stall owner. I looked at the watch on my wrist, pointing to 8:16.

### Courage Like a Lion

— Ge Chunliang

That beautiful lion tamer stood still, biting on a piece of white sugar. A ferocious lion roared and pounced, biting the white sugar from the tamer's lips.

"There's nothing special about that, I can do it too!" a young man shouted loudly.

"Dare you?" The circus lady said with a sneer.

"Of course! I can do better than the lion!"

### Three Poems for Farewell

— Shi Shufan

A short three months together, I clearly saw your heart and soul. Your talent roars like illness, Who will appreciate your good poems? The wilderness road of Dian and Shu, A humble gift at Yanjin's ferry. This journey is not your choice, Your disappointment is also bitter.

You are like an untamed horse, And I am an unbridled donkey. No tears to shed at parting, But home is still far away. Fame is as thin as dust, Sweat and blood under the dim lamp. This meaning travels a thousand miles, We look forward to competing for the top!

Gold often suffers hardship, A red heart always supports the sky. No way to serve the country? I pity my own writing. My promise is firm, See you again next year! When old friends ask, My beard is gray but my bones are still strong.

### Impressions of Guangzhou

— Ji Mu

A friend of mine went to Hong Kong on business a month ago. Recently, after completing his work, he returned to Shanghai via Guangzhou and described to me his experiences in Guangzhou, which gave me a vivid and deep impression.

It is said that Guangzhou's urban area is vast, and the population is dense, not inferior to Shanghai. The housing shortage problem is particularly serious, and there are very few houses for rent. The city's main roads are wide and flat, and the buildings along the roads often extend beyond the sidewalks, supported by pillars. When it rains, walking under the buildings can prevent you from getting wet, which is somewhat similar to the Jinling East Road area of Shanghai. However, the narrow streets and alleys often have twists and turns, and there are few straight and cross-roads that lead in all directions.

Those who visit Guangzhou for the first time find it quite novel that the roofs of some buildings are level with the road surface, or even lower than the road. This is because the terrain in Guangzhou is uneven, and some roads are filled in on low-lying areas, resulting in this phenomenon. Visitors must step down to visit the residents there.

As the saying goes, "Eat in Guangzhou." Guangzhou residents seem to be very interested in eating. Whether they are from middle or lower-class families, they all go to restaurants for breakfast to eat small snacks such as sesame paste and fish porridge. The prices are quite expensive, but the restaurants are crowded in the morning, and the profits are tripled. From the restaurants, one can also glimpse the "tough" character of the Cantonese people, who are not accommodating. For example, shops that specialize in selling sweets do not sell salty food, and vice versa. In addition, the same shop stipulates that it will supply a certain dim sum in the morning and another dim sum in the afternoon. If you ask for a dim sum other than the stipulated one, you cannot buy it. This is quite different from Shanghai's Wu Fang Zhai, which sells large meat noodles and fish noodles, and also sells mung bean soup and candied sweet potatoes depending on the season.

Guangzhou people are very frugal and casual in their clothing. In summer, most people wear silk gauze trousers and wooden clogs, even rickshaw pullers cannot avoid this. Pulling a rickshaw while dragging wooden clogs naturally makes them pull very slowly.

Daily necessities in Guangzhou, such as rice, vegetables, meat, and cloth, are more expensive than in Shanghai. Before the currency reform, the legal currency inflated too much, and most of the transactions in the urban area were based on Hong Kong dollars. However, since the issuance of the gold yuan coupon, the market has stabilized. The exchange rate between Hong Kong dollars and gold yuan coupons is also regulated, which shows that the credit is well-established and deeply trusted by the people.

Speaking of Guangzhou women, the daughters of the South are known for their passion. My friend believes that they wear a lot of makeup, such as smearing dark circles around their eyes, applying powder, and dabbing rouge. As the poem of the ancients says, "Light makeup and heavy makeup are both suitable." Guangzhou women belong to the heavy makeup type.

### Reunion

— Tingzhi

One day, in Adelaide, Australia, a woman boarded a bus, wanting to find a seat. At that time, a male passenger stood up politely and gave her his seat. She thanked him casually and was about to sit down when she suddenly caught a glimpse of the man's face. She suddenly cried out, "George!" and fainted to the ground, unconscious.

It turned out that the man who gave up his seat was her husband, who had been missing for a long time after joining the army and was said to have been killed in action.

The man was shocked and jumped up. At that time, the ticket seller and other passengers had rushed over to take care of the woman. They helped her up. The man stared at the woman's face blankly, as if drunk or in a dream. Slowly, his dull eyes came to life, and he woke up as if from a dream, recognizing that this was his long-lost wife. It turned out that he had suffered severe brain trauma on the battlefield and developed a disease. He had forgotten who he was and where he lived. Even after the war ended, he still wandered around in a semi-conscious state. Even though he wandered to his hometown, he was unaware of it. It wasn't until this moment that he woke up and the couple was reunited.

This is a recent true story, and the Associated Press of the United States has reported this news.

### Glimpses

— Jinlin

The total number of horses in the world—excluding wild horses—is approximately 110,000,000. The Soviet Union accounts for one-third of this number, approximately 35,000,000.

The world's largest pearl belongs to American explorer Wilburn and weighs fifteen pounds. The second largest is the famous "Hope Pearl," which weighs only six ounces and is worth 45,000 pounds.

### Answering Readers' Questions Regarding Student Aid

And Please All Schools Promptly Submit the List of Free Students to the Scholarship Review Committee

In the past week, we have received many letters from readers asking about the payment date of the Shen Bao Reader's Student Aid. We are now giving a general response here.

The "Reader's Student Aid" for this year began soliciting donations in July and began accepting applications in late August. The newspaper completed the preliminary review of all 300+ applications in late September and submitted the applications to the Municipal Scholarship Review Committee for review. According to the Committee's regulations, students applying for student aid from any organization or group must have the school they are attending have a prescribed number of free student slots before they can be approved. This is a necessary measure to prevent schools from "being generous at the expense of others." However, to this day, nearly half of the schools whose students have applied for student aid from this newspaper have been slow to submit the list of free students to the Committee, or even if they have submitted it, the required number of free slots is insufficient. According to the investigation, the secondary schools that have not yet submitted the list of free students for review include Hu Xin, Guanghua Affiliated High School, St. Francis, Zhen Dan Affiliated High School, Patriotic Girls' High School, Minli, China, Weiyu, Southeast, Zhengzhong, Zhengzhong Girls' High School, Xuhui Girls' High School, Huaien, YMCA, Qixiu Girls' High School, Xinhua, Dajiang, Dade Midwifery, Lixing, Sino-French, Qingxin, Mengxian, Law School Affiliated High School, and Minzhi - a total of 24 schools. As for those with an insufficient number of free student slots, there are Datong Affiliated High School (Campus 1 and 2), Minli Girls' High School, Chongshi, Xiaoguang, Shenjiang Girls' High School, Jingwen Girls' High School, Qianghua Technical College, Xihua, and Guangcheng Technical College - a total of ten schools. Therefore, the reason why the student aid from this newspaper cannot be distributed quickly is not due to this newspaper, nor is it due to the Review Committee.

The Review Committee has now ordered the aforementioned schools to submit their applications by the end of this month. We sincerely hope that the authorities of the aforementioned schools can submit the list of free students as soon as possible within the deadline so that the impoverished students who are waiting anxiously every day can receive the student aid as soon as possible and can study with peace of mind.
