### Situ Limen Announces Ten Plans in Washington to Assist Our Recovery; Second Batch of Industrial Component Funds Allocated at US$17.85 Million; Railways and Electricity Will Be Expanded and Smuggling Suppressed

[United States Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), 14th] Mr. Situ Limen, head of the U.S. ECA Investigation Team, announced ten new plans on the 13th at a Washington press conference to assist our economic recovery under the US$35 million ECA industrial component plan.  A total of US$17,850,000 has been tentatively allocated to each project. (The first batch of funds, US$4.4 million, was announced in Shanghai on September 1.)  This plan is extremely important to China's industrial production increase and economic stability.

The majority of the aforementioned total is designated for improving China's four major railways.  The Canton-Hankow Railway, the lifeline of South China's transportation, received US$5 million; the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway, which connects the Yangtze River basin and the Canton-Hankow Railway, received US$2.5 million; the Peiping-Tientsin Railway, which connects Peiping and Tientsin and transports coal from the Kailan mines, received US$1.5 million; and the Taiwan Railway, which surrounds western Taiwan, received US$1.5 million.

Situ Limen also announced five new electricity projects, among which the Nanjing Small Power Plant received US$2.5 million.  Peiping received US$2.5 million.  Next, the small power plants in Central and Southern China, run by the Resource Committee, received a total of US$2.5 million.  The power plants in Peiping, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shenyang, and Tsingtao received US$2 million (including the funds previously announced for merging with the Peiping-Tientsin power grid).  The Hankow Power Plant received US$300,000, and the Chongqing Power Plant received US$250,000.  The tenth project announced by Situ Limen is for supplying components and equipment for Chinese customs to suppress smuggling, totaling US$1 million.  Situ emphasized the overall importance of the industrial component plan to China, stating that it will benefit every level of the Chinese people.  Situ also said that the industrial construction and component plan will make the most of the materials supplied to China by UNRRA.  Also, surplus U.S. military materials will be utilized as much as possible.  He also stated, "We are now preparing all steps to ensure that the materials and equipment supplied by the ECA can be guaranteed in procurement, transportation, and after arrival in China in terms of installation and effective use. We firmly believe that these items will not be left in warehouses or flow into non-productive channels due to a lack of proper preparation, financial arrangements, or supervision."

Situ and Yan Jia'gan are scheduled to return to China together within a week to carry out the final steps of implementing the industrial construction and component plan.  To date, the total industrial component funds that have been announced have reached US$22,250,000.  The remaining US$12,750,000 will be used for other components, possible material value-added, and other unforeseen needs.  The ECA's US$35 million industrial construction plan (US$35 million has already been allocated for component use, and the same amount will be used for industrial construction) is currently under discussion with the Chinese government.  The ECA hopes that Situ and Yan will be able to reach an agreement with the Chinese government upon their return to China.

### Yu Hongjun Attends Kuomintang Memorial Week and Reports on U.S. Aid Utilization Work Based on Self-Reliance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Yu Hongjun, Deputy Chairman of the Executive Yuan's U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, reported on the utilization of U.S. aid at the Kuomintang Central Memorial Week this morning. His original remarks were as follows:

Before reporting on the utilization of U.S. aid, I would like to first report on the purpose of U.S. aid utilization: The utilization of U.S. aid is based on the "Agreement between the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America regarding Economic Assistance," signed by the two parties on July 3rd of this year, which is the so-called bilateral agreement. The United States, based on its national policy, provides economic assistance to various self-reliant countries after the war. Therefore, it passed the Economic Assistance Act for European and Asian countries. Based on this act, the bilateral agreement between China and the U.S. was created. The preamble of the agreement briefly and concisely explains that because the Chinese government is determined to implement a self-help plan to stabilize the domestic economic situation, and the United States government is also providing economic assistance to the Chinese government and people in accordance with the provisions of its 1948 China Aid Act, the two parties negotiated the terms to promote this friendly international policy.

Therefore, the utilization of U.S. aid can be said to be based on self-reliance, with U.S. aid complementing it to promote its success. If we make good use of U.S. aid, it will certainly be easier to become self-reliant. The utilization of U.S. aid is based on the spirit of self-reliance. The entire U.S. aid program comes from self-reliance and must be implemented with the spirit of self-reliance. This is the meaning of the current U.S. economic assistance to China and is different from ordinary international reciprocity treaties or treaties for other purposes.

The colleagues of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, under the direction of Chairman Weng, follow the above principles in utilizing U.S. aid. We also coordinate with the current domestic financial and economic situation, focusing on key points and prioritizing based on urgency to ensure the proper utilization of funds. The purposes of utilizing U.S. aid are threefold: (1) to stabilize the economy in order to balance domestic income and expenditure; (2) to save foreign exchange reserves in order to balance international income and expenditure; and (3) to promote agricultural and industrial production in order to lay the foundation for economic recovery. In general, selling U.S. aid materials is a way to contract currency and balance domestic income and expenditure; transporting materials is a way to save foreign exchange and balance international income and expenditure; and formulating construction plans and assisting agricultural and industrial development are ways to promote production and revive the economy. Some of the above methods are aimed at long-term solutions for centuries to come, while others are aimed at addressing the current urgent problems and seeking solutions. The aforementioned items (1) and (2) are closer to symptomatic treatments, while item (3) is closer to fundamental treatment. In the current situation, symptomatic treatment is more urgent than fundamental treatment, but in terms of nature, fundamental treatment is certainly more important than symptomatic treatment. Therefore, most of the U.S. aid is used to stabilize the current economy, while encouraging production is also planned for concurrently, so that we can overcome difficulties, lay the foundation, and realize the principles of self-help, self-reliance, and regeneration.

Status of U.S. Aid Materials

Now, I will briefly report on the status of U.S. aid materials separately:

Important Contents of the Agreement: The full text of the Sino-U.S. Economic Assistance Agreement consists of twelve articles, and its content is quite extensive. The most important points are described below: (A) Our country promises to implement various self-help plans, such as the effective utilization of economic resources, the promotion of agricultural production development, the improvement of production and marketing, the stabilization of the currency and finances, and budget matters, in order to cooperate with U.S. aid and maximize the improvement of the economic situation. (B) The U.S. aid materials supplied shall be agreed upon by both China and the United States for processing and distribution. (C) Our government shall open a special account at the Central Bank and deposit the amount of U.S. dollars equivalent to the value of the materials supplied by the U.S. on a grant basis, in national currency, to be used for (1) the U.S. administrative expenses for implementing U.S. aid, (2) rural reconstruction funds, (3) domestic transportation costs for relief materials and packages, (4) freezing measures taken to stabilize the currency and finances, (5) expenditures to encourage production and develop new wealth, (6) expenditures to promote programs or plans, and (7) expenditures for relief and work relief programs under the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement that have not yet been completed. If there is a surplus as of April 3, 1949, the two governments will separately agree on how to spend it. (D) For materials that are lacking in U.S. resources but produced in our country, our country shall facilitate their transfer in accordance with the terms of sale, exchange, barter, or other methods agreed upon by the two governments.

According to the agreement, when the U.S. supplies materials on a grant basis, our country shall deposit the U.S. dollar cost of the materials into a special account at the Central Bank in national currency. This is tantamount to the government purchasing materials with national currency. Therefore, if the sales price of the materials cannot cover the original cost, and the funds allocated to the special account are not frozen as much as possible, then the various expenditures will require hundreds of millions of dollars, or even increase the national debt. This point is of utmost importance and must be given special attention to tighten up at any time in order to meet the purpose of stabilizing finance and economy.

Time Limit for the Use of Special Funds

The amount of U.S. aid to China is US$275 million for the economic portion, of which US$215 million is a grant and US$60 million is a loan. The agreed allocation of the grant portion is as follows: (1) US$70 million for food, (2) US$70 million for cotton, (3) US$50 million for oil, (4) US$13.8 million for fertilizer, (5) US$10 million for industrial supplementary equipment, and (6) US$1.2 million for U.S. administrative expenses. The total is US$215 million. The loan portion is US$60 million for the Industrial Construction Plan.

According to the law, the above-mentioned materials and special funds for construction plans have a time limit from April of this year to March of next year, which is one year. For the sake of convenience, the appropriation time will be divided into four phases, each lasting three months. (Continued on page 2)

### Zhang Qun and His Wife Return to Shanghai; Will Go to Nanjing to Report on Their Visit to Japan Within Days

[Reported by this newspaper] Former Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun arrived in Shanghai by Northwest Airlines flight from Tokyo at 1:20 PM yesterday, accompanied by his wife and advisor Shao Yulin. Zhang was immediately surrounded by the welcoming crowd after disembarking. Chiang Ching-kuo, Fang Zhi, Chen Guolian, Zhang Jiaju, and others who were waiting at the scene rushed forward to shake hands and express their joy. Zhang was wearing a dark blue tweed suit with stripes. After three weeks in Japan, his complexion was noticeably darker, but he was in good spirits and did not appear tired. When reporters rushed forward to ask him to make a statement, he laughed and said, "I have already made many statements in Japan. Now, I am in a hurry and have nothing else to say." When a reporter asked him about the problems of Japan's relationship with India and the U.S. support for Japan, he replied, "Today, I cannot answer any questions. If I have any statements, I will make them publicly and will never make them to any reporter alone." After speaking, he left the airport with his wife and Zhang Jiaju in the same car.

According to someone close to Zhang, Zhang will stay in Shanghai for about one or two days and then go to Nanjing to report to the central government on his visit to Japan. His statement to the press may be made in Nanjing.

### Finance Minister Wang Scheduled to Fly to the U.S. to Preside Over International Development Bank Board Meeting and Seek Construction Loans

[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Board of Governors meeting for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is scheduled to be held in the United States on the 27th of this month. As the chairmanship of this meeting is to be rotated to our country's Finance Minister, our Finance Minister Wang Yunwu has decided to personally attend the meeting in the United States. He is scheduled to travel by night train from Nanjing to Shanghai on the 20th, and fly to the United States on the 22nd. Only Song Ziliang and one or two others will accompany Wang. Song, as an alternate director of the IBRD, will participate in the meeting as an alternate director. In addition to presiding over the IBRD Board of Governors meeting, Wang will also take the opportunity to propose loans for reconstruction and development. After the currency reforms in France, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Luxembourg, these four countries all received loans from the bank. With our country's currency reform and the prospect of economic stability, we can also hope to follow their example and submit an application for loans. It is reported that Wang will stay in the United States for two weeks, during which time the affairs of the Ministry of Finance will be temporarily handled by Political Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan.

### Legislative Yuan Continues to Hold Closed-Door Meetings; President Weng and Others Attend to Answer Questions; Finance Minister Wang Says Leak of Secrets Was Due to Careless Hiring

[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Legislative Yuan held its second closed-door session at 9:00 AM on the 13th to continue questioning about the emergency financial and economic measures, with more than 300 members in attendance. Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Qitian, Sun Yueqi, and Agricultural Vice Minister Xie Chengyu were all present. President Sun attended with illness and presided over the meeting. Members who spoke included Liu Youchen, Liu Mingyang, Hou Shaowen, Chen Shaoxian, Zheng Zhenyu, Wu Shipeng, Yang Baolin, Huang Shaozi (read on his behalf), Zou Shuwen, Shen Chongyu, Zhou Yongneng, Wang Dezhen, and Dong Wei. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 noon. The afternoon session resumed at 3:00 PM with more than 200 members in attendance. President Sun was excused due to illness, and Wang Qijiang was elected as chairman. Members Duan Jianmin, Yang Dagian, Pi Dezhong, Lian Mou, Ye Daoyuan, Miao Qiping, Li Yu, Zhang Ziqu, and others spoke successively. During the members' questioning, many valuable opinions were expressed. The case of the Ministry of Finance's leak of secrets was also mentioned. At 5:40 PM, in addition to those who had switched to written submissions, there were still dozens of people who had not had a chance to speak. After the chairman sought the opinions of the members, it was unanimously passed that those who had not yet spoken would switch to written questions.

### Wang Yunwu's Reply

Finance Minister Wang then gave a reply. Wang first expressed his gratitude for the valuable opinions of the members, and said, "I should not only reply verbally and in writing in the short term, but also reply with facts." This remark immediately earned a round of applause. He continued, saying that the budget revenue and expenditure for the second half of the year could be offset. The issuance of 2 billion Gold Yuan, compared with the 1.6 billion legal tender issued by the central government before the war in 1937 and the 400 million provincial currency, totaled 2 billion, which was obviously not a large number. The reason why eight-ninths of the budget for the six months of the second half of this year was used up in July and August was in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the Implementation Regulations of the General Budget Act. In the future, with the stability of the currency value, the reduction in the rate of currency circulation, and the stability of prices, the budget can be balanced. Regarding the salt tax increase, Wang said that the government was very sorry, but in order to balance the budget, it was adjusted according to the price index in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the Implementation Regulations of the General Budget Act, and the government had no intention of ignoring the Legislative Yuan's resolution. As for the salaries of public school teachers, the government originally intended to adjust them after reducing redundant personnel in order to balance the budget, but was afraid of creating unemployment problems. However, they are not increased at present, and there is still a possibility of increasing them in the future. Regarding the leak of secrets by senior officials of the Ministry of Finance, Wang repeatedly made a "frank explanation," saying that it was only "careless hiring." He himself was indeed responsible for preventing the leakage of secrets, and he also personally assisted in the arrest after the incident. Wang concluded by saying that his personal decision to stay or leave was entirely based on the interests of the country. If the country does not need him to serve as Finance Minister, he will resign immediately. If he is still needed, he can only do his best. (Applause).

### Yu Hongjun's Reply

Next, President Yu Hongjun replied: (1) Commercial banks must have reserve funds when issuing cashier's checks. If it is found that the reserve funds are insufficient and cannot be cashed, the license will be revoked immediately. (2) The matter of wealthy families obtaining foreign exchange illegally has been thoroughly investigated by the Control Yuan in advance, and a report has been issued. (3) Someone mentioned the Yangtze Electric Company. In fact, the company is not the Shanghai Yangtze Export Company. He concluded by saying that at the beginning of the reform, the Central Bank had many shortcomings, and he hoped that the members would give more guidance (applause).

### Weng Wenhao's Reply

Finally, President Weng gave a reply. First, he explained the handling of the case of the leak of secrets by officials of the Ministry of Finance, and then explained several points: (1) The grain rationing system in the five major cities is being implemented in accordance with the established policies of the previous Executive Yuan. Although there are difficulties, there are many advantages and it has continued value. (2) The government is actively rectifying the handling of enemy and puppet properties, which can be sold to enrich the national treasury. (3) People can openly report foreign exchange at home and abroad and foreign assets, and the government welcomes this assistance. (4) The deadline for the purchase of gold, silver, and foreign exchange (September 30) will be the end, and the credit of the Gold Yuan will be further enhanced at that time. At 6:30 PM, Weng's reply also ended in applause, and the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting.

### Foreign Deputy Minister Yieh Kung-chao Discusses the South Korean Representative Issue

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] Foreign Deputy Minister Yieh Kung-chao told reporters on the evening of the 13th: "Now that the South Korean government has been formally established, the Chinese government will naturally recognize the official diplomatic representative it sends. However, before the establishment of the South Korean government, the Chinese government obviously had no way to recognize any national group representing the Korean people." Mr. Yieh made these remarks in response to reporters' questions after meeting with Ambassador Cho Byung-ok, the private representative of the South Korean President, at 3:30 p.m. to hear his request to revoke the recognition of the South Korean delegation. According to Mr. Cho, who, upon arriving in Nanjing on the 12th, involved Kim Gu and the current South Korean delegation in Nanjing when addressing reporters, the head of the delegation, Min Seok-rin, issued a statement on the afternoon of the 13th to refute him. The statement said, "The remarks made by Representative Cho Byung-ok to reporters, as published in various newspapers on the 13th, contain many misunderstandings and improprieties regarding this delegation, which must be corrected. Mr. Cho completely failed to understand the history of this delegation and the reasons why it has continued to operate until now, and he abruptly told reporters that he would ask Foreign Minister Wang to revoke recognition of this delegation, which is deeply regrettable. This delegation has been established for more than three years since the return of the provisional government to the country, and its mission has been well known to the Chinese government and people from all walks of life. With the establishment of our country's government, this delegation's mission was completed, and it was originally intended to be dissolved. However, on August 11, this delegation received a telegram from President Lee, instructing it to temporarily continue its operations, so it obeyed the order to postpone the dissolution. Mr. Cho's remarks about revoking recognition of this delegation are completely baseless and absurd. Mr. Cho came to China as a representative of the country and made such undignified remarks, which are extremely inappropriate. The above is not a personal attack on Mr. Cho; his remarks to reporters were so false and improper that they had to be corrected." Mr. Cho then issued a statement in response to this statement in the evening, saying, "The 'Korean Delegation' is an unofficial body, but its name is misleading and easily leads people to believe that it can represent the Korean government. The Korean government will soon appoint an official representative to China, but until this happens, any temporary delegation in China should not be recognized as representing the Korean government." He said that he had conveyed this intention to Foreign Deputy Minister Yieh Kung-chao when he met with him in the afternoon.

Editorial

### Supplementary Points for Cracking Down on Hoarding

There are three types of laws and regulations regarding cracking down on hoarding: (1) the "Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times," which were ordered to be re-applied in February of the 36th year [1947]; (2) the "Implementation Precautions for the Above-mentioned Measures," which were drafted and promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in January of this year; and (3) the "Supplementary Points for the Above-mentioned Measures," which were recently passed by the Executive Yuan and ordered by the Executive Yuan to be implemented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

The so-called supplementary measures consist of seven articles, the full text of which has already appeared in this newspaper on the 11th. The supplementary points are four:

(1) Goods needed for the business operations of merchants in this industry shall not exceed one-quarter of the annual need (except for seasonal goods);

(2) Implement warehouse inspections at designated locations;

(3) Fines of less than 1,000 Legal Tender Yuan are changed to fines of less than 1,000 Gold Yuan;

(4) The competent authority for implementing these laws and regulations, in municipalities and provincial capitals, in addition to the Bureau of Social Affairs or the Department of Social Affairs, will "handle cases jointly with public security and police agencies."

The above points two, three, and four are all natural measures adapted to the facts. The more novel point is the first point, that is, seasonal inventory can be excluded from the annual business needs limit, which can be said to be a balance between legal regulations and commercial information, and is naturally welcome to merchants.

Here, it is necessary to provide additional explanations to the authorities: (1) Outdated goods, that is, styles, colors, and varieties that are no longer fashionable and cannot be sold in time, are especially prominent in fast-changing metropolitan areas. (2) Slow-selling goods, such as cement and machinery, have accumulated inventories that are difficult to clear. (3) Unpopular goods, such as books and instruments, have sales that cannot be achieved by one-sided promotion. Therefore, we believe that the scope of the proviso for seasonal goods is still too narrow.

Some people believe that these supplementary points are intended to supplement the crackdown on hoarding of important daily necessities, and their scope is limited to food, clothing, fuel, daily necessities, and other important daily necessities designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and has nothing to do with other goods. If this interpretation can be followed during the implementation, we also consider it very appropriate.

The second item of the supplementary points stipulates that the finished products and goods stored by factories and shops should be supplied and sold as much as possible and should not exceed the price limit. However, there is no quantity limit on the raw materials stored in the factory, only that the output, purchase, sales, and inventory (finished products, raw materials, and important materials) should be reported together when submitting the monthly report. This is also a commendable thing. Because raw materials are the basis for factory re-production, the more abundant the reserves, the more guaranteed the production. Now that it is taken out of the scope of hoarding that should be cracked down on, it cannot be said to be a very wise move. However, we still hope that hoarding by non-merchants or non-industry merchants will be strictly cracked down on according to law in order to reduce costs and increase supply. Judging from the past situation, non-industry people monopolizing raw materials and shirking responsibility are obviously an important factor in raising prices and suppressing manufacturers! And the factory itself should not accumulate raw materials for production needs within the scope of crackdown.

The hoarding behavior referred to in the crackdown measures is conditional on large-scale purchases and storage, but what number is considered a large amount? This question was not clearly explained until the promulgation of the "Precautions", that is, "any amount exceeding one-fifth to one-third of the annual need is considered a large amount." However, the first item of the supplementary points issued this time stipulates that "it shall not exceed one-quarter of the annual need", which is inconsistent before and after. Fortunately, the lower paragraph of the same article still has the provision that "the limit for crackdown shall be determined by the local competent authority... based on the above standards... taking into account the supply and demand situation at any time." During the implementation, it should be considered and changed according to the situation, and do not stick to the one-quarter standard in order to promote the greatest benefit.

The so-called crackdown measures and precautions are not without shortcomings. For example, speculative behavior is originally conditional on raising prices above legal profits (Article 3 of the crackdown measures), but the legal profits of each goods are not consistent, and how to distinguish them is not an easy task. Also, if the goods that should be sold at a limited price cannot be sold by the deadline, the material management or fair-price supply and marketing agency shall purchase them at a fair price (Article 12 of the same measures). Until today, we have not seen this material management or fair-price supply and marketing agency able to cooperate. This is an implementation problem, not a legislative problem, but if it is not feasible in practice, it seems better to directly amend it.

Regarding various economic laws and regulations, due to the environmental factors at the time of promulgation, they are inevitably piecemeal and random, and they are dealt with at any time, and there is no consistent policy, resulting in many repetitions and contradictions. The various points mentioned above are still relatively minor problems. We very much hope that the competent department will pay more attention to the work of sorting out laws and regulations, because the implementation of all policies still depends on the law as a standard. If the laws and regulations have shortcomings and loopholes, it will inevitably make the executors feel a lot of difficulties.

### National Austerity and Construction Movement Outline Draft Submitted to the President for Review Economic and Spiritual Collaboration Development and Transformation of Society

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] The "National Austerity and Construction Movement Outline" initiated under the leadership of the President has been drafted by Huang Shao-gu, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and others designated to be responsible for it. After several meetings, the draft has now been completed and submitted to the President for review. It is expected to be promulgated and implemented in the near future. According to a reporter's investigation, this outline is similar to the New Life Movement, but its scope is broader. It can also be said to be the embodiment of the New Life Movement, the National Spiritual Mobilization, and the National Economic Construction Movement. Diligence in production refers to the positive aspect, and frugality in consumption refers to the negative aspect. Production is economic, and thrift is spiritual. The two complement each other and develop together as a social movement. It can also be said to be a social transformation movement. The full text of the outline is divided into three parts: one is to explain the needs of the current era, the second is the mission of national construction, and the third is the covenant. According to Minister Peng Zhao-xian, who jointly drafted the case, the movement focuses on creating a trend and avoiding the formalism of the past. It does not specifically establish an agency to be in charge of it. Although the advocacy is in the President, it still needs the assistance and expansion of local public opinion agencies and social figures to ensure that this movement can be effectively promoted and achieve results, and that it is automatic for each other, then the future can be optimistic.

### Nickel Coin Case in Kunming and Chengdu Interview with Person in Charge of National Bank Delay in Announcement May Be Due to Practical Difficulties

[Central News Agency, this city] Regarding the case of the Kunming and Chengdu branches of the Central Bank delaying the announcement of the resumption of the use of nickel coins and taking the opportunity to make profits, the person in charge of the National Bank said yesterday: According to reports, the Kunming and Chengdu branches of the Bank, after the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, delayed the announcement for several days regarding the conversion of the old nickel coins into Gold Yuan notes and the resumption of circulation, causing a buying spree of nickel coins in the market, taking the opportunity to make profits, and disrupting the financial market. There is suspicion of perfunctorily selling their jobs and engaging in corruption. The provincial councils of Yunnan and Sichuan have respectively reported the case and telegraphed the central government to thoroughly investigate and punish it. Regarding the part of the case involving private corruption, in addition to the central government paying close attention to the investigation, the head office attaches great importance to it and is now sending people to thoroughly investigate it. It is believed that there will be facts to investigate. Before the truth is clarified, the head office does not intend to express any opinions. However, the head office believes that there may be practical difficulties in delaying the announcement of the resumption of the use of auxiliary coins. The reason is that the Bank announced the issuance of Gold Yuan auxiliary currency notes and auxiliary coins on August 20 and telegraphed it to the branches in various places at the same time. At that time, because the full text was too long and the content was complicated, and there were many branch units, it had to send a summary telegram, so the branches in various places, after receiving the telegram, did not dare to announce it immediately due to the lack of clarity on the technical details of the issuance of Gold Yuan currency, and repeatedly telegraphed the head office for clarification. Therefore, the exchange of telegrams inevitably took some time, and such important telegrams were different from ordinary commercial telegrams because the codes were dense and translation took time. The translators also needed to be particularly careful, so the time for translating telegrams was longer than that of ordinary telegrams. Therefore, whether the Kunming and Chengdu branches deliberately delayed the announcement of the issuance of auxiliary coins needs to be determined after a thorough investigation. As for whether there was any opportunistic corruption before the announcement period, it is a matter of fact and can be thoroughly investigated.

### Students in Exile Beat Machinists Tram Stopped All Day Yesterday The Municipal Government Promised to Send Police to Protect Them Reopened in the Evening

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 13th] The tram, which is the only means of transportation in the Beiping city area, was finally defeated by the students in exile on the 13th. The tram stopped all day on the 13th. More than 700 machinists originally planned to carry 27 injured machinists in a parade this morning and go to the Suppression General's Office and the Municipal Government to petition. However, due to public security issues, the company authorities persuaded them to give up. As for the resumption of work, the workers proposed that the government must be able to guarantee their safety before they can resume work. Later, Gao Zaitian, the managing director of the company, went to the Municipal Government to discuss the matter. It was decided that each shift would add one policeman to suppress the situation, and each major station would add several policemen to maintain order. In addition, two patrol cars would be dispatched regularly to patrol the tram lines. The workers have reluctantly accepted this and resumed traffic at 6 p.m. According to news from the company, the students not only beat the machinists on the tram, but even went to the machinists' homes to beat them. The workers are very angry about this. If it is not handled properly in the future, the consequences will be very serious.

### Yu Hung-chun Reports on the Utilization of US Aid

(Continued from Page 1) First phase: From April to June of this year, the US Congress approved a total of US$36.5 million to be advanced by the Reconstruction Bank Corporation, stipulating that the funds would be used for: (1) US$13.5 million for food, (2) US$13 million for cotton, (3) US$1.5 million for fertilizer, (4) US$8 million for oil, and (5) US$500,000 for investigation expenses. Among the above items, the food item can purchase about 9,000 tons of flour and about 67,000 tons of rice, about 70,000 bales of cotton, about 10,420 tons of fertilizer, and the oil item is mainly fuel oil, worth more than 2.9 million US dollars, followed by diesel, worth more than 1.7 million US dollars, followed by gasoline for vehicles, worth more than 1 million US dollars, and the remaining aviation gasoline, kerosene, lubricating oil, crude oil, etc., worth more than 2 million US dollars.

Second phase: From July to September of this year, the total amount of expenditure was US$71.2 million, allocated as follows: (1) US$6.5 million for food, (2) US$41.7 million for cotton, (3) US$14 million for oil, (4) US$4 million for fertilizer, and (5) US$5 million for industrial equipment. Among the above items, the food item can purchase about 9,000 tons of flour and 22,000 tons of rice, and more than 232,000 bales of cotton; for the fertilizer item, technical experts are consulting with the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration to jointly discuss the procurement and distribution methods; the oil demand has been estimated, and the quantity to be purchased in the second phase has been calculated. The request has been submitted to the US Economic Cooperation Administration by the US Economic Branch and the delegation led by our technical team, and is awaiting approval; the industrial equipment item can only be handled after the construction plan proposed by the Stuart Leighton investigation team has been approved.

Third phase: The appropriations for the third phase from October to December of this year and the fourth phase from January to March of next year, including construction funds, total US$167.3 million, of which about US$100 million can be used to purchase materials. How this fund will be distributed in stages is being discussed by both parties.

As of August 31, the materials shipped in the first and second phases included 65,730 long tons of rice and 8,939 long tons of flour. The materials being shipped included 11,168 long tons of rice and 8,961 long tons of flour. Of the rice shipped, 61,746 long tons have been delivered to the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee for distribution and sale in Shanghai, and 2,685 long tons in Guangzhou, including 1,500 long tons in Shantou. The amount sold by the Shanghai People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee is 37,263.80 long tons, and the actual price received is 2,339,302.95 Gold Yuan. For the cotton item, the US has agreed to transfer the funds from the two phases to pay for the US cotton that the China Textile Construction Company originally ordered and has been shipped to Shanghai. The first phase of cotton, 69,878 bales, is in the process of customs clearance. The second phase of cotton, more than 232,000 bales allocated under the US aid program, has been issued a payment notice by the US and can also be cleared through customs. For the oil item, the intention is also to transfer the funds from the two phases to pay for the oil that has arrived in Shanghai. After the US approves and the payment procedures are completed, the goods can be picked up.

Methods of Using Materials

The methods of using various materials are briefly described as follows: (A) The utilization of rice and flour will continue to follow the method of supplying and distributing rice in major port cities. At present, in addition to the five major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, Qingdao is also temporarily included. The above measures can reduce the supply of rice from domestic rice-producing areas to the above-mentioned major cities, making the price of food in the interior gradually stabilize. At the same time, the sales income can be transferred to support agriculture and industry, so that all relevant areas can benefit from US aid. However, the proposed distribution price should be close to the market price. If the selling price is too low, it will be equivalent to providing relief to a portion of the people, which seems unfair. At the same time, if the income decreases, the benefits of utilization will also be reduced. However, according to US estimates, all US aid food is only enough for the allocation of the above-mentioned major cities by more than 40%, so if the distribution is implemented, the remaining 60% must be provided by our government itself. The quantity of US aid food that can be purchased may not be able to fully meet our hopes due to world food quotas and harvest seasons. At the same time, the timing of the US aid portion and the portion provided by our government must also be taken into account. Therefore, the food distribution problem is still being discussed and planned by the committee and the competent department at any time in order to find a solution. (B) Cotton According to recent estimates, from July of this year to March of next year, within nine months, the amount of raw cotton in my country's textile industry will be about 900,000 to 950,000 bales short. The US cotton obtained under the US aid program is only 360,000 bales, which is still 600,000 bales short. In order to remedy this, the funds for US aid cotton should be managed in a way that allows them to circulate and be used to maintain production. The Cotton Committee has agreed on the following distribution principles: (1) cotton is exchanged for yarn or cloth; (2) half of the exchanged yarn and cloth are exported, and half are sold domestically; (3) the foreign exchange obtained from the export of yarn and cloth is jointly managed by the US Aid Association and the US Economic Branch to exchange for cotton or related supplies to maintain domestic production. Regarding the ratio of cotton to yarn, it has been discussed many times and a compromise has been reached. In the first phase, 599 pounds of cotton will be exchanged for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn. The first phase of US cotton, 69,878 bales, can be delivered to the Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Joint Transportation Office for distribution to various spinning mills within days. (Continued on Page 3)

### The Berlin Problem Remains Unresolved: The Three Powers Plan to Force a Showdown with the Soviets; Three Envoys to Visit the Kremlin Again Today; If Negotiations Fail, Resolution Will Be Submitted to the UN General Assembly

[Our Dispatch] London, 13th (Broadcast from Moscow): The special envoys of the United States, Britain, and France held a meeting at the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union this morning to consider the report from Cythot, foreign affairs advisor to the French military governor Koenig, who returned from Berlin after discussions with the four governors. The three envoys, recognizing that their next meeting would be the final juncture, sought to ensure adequate preparation beforehand to align their views. It is therefore anticipated that the three envoys will not visit the Kremlin tonight, the 13th. Western observers suggest the three envoys might visit the Kremlin on the 14th.

[United Press London, 13th] United Press learned on the 13th that the instructions prepared by the Western three powers in London and delivered to the three envoys in Moscow have been finalized. Their content "amounts to a demand for a showdown in direct negotiations in Moscow." The three envoys will explain to the Soviet Union that the West has become impatient with Soviet perfidy and will not allow such a fruitless approach to continue. This is not an appeal to Stalin; in fact, the strong tone of these instructions borders on an ultimatum, although Western diplomats are still reluctant to use that term. It is understood that the instructions explicitly state that the procedures agreed upon by Stalin and the Western envoys in Moscow, and the orders sent by the Soviet government to Sokolovsky, differ greatly in spirit and content. According to the original agreement, by this point, the Berlin Conference should have reached an agreement, paving the way for a foreign ministers' conference to discuss the global situation caused by Germany, ultimately leading to a relaxation of tensions in Europe. Conversely, the Berlin blockade remains in place, the situation is deteriorating, the overall condition is worsening, and the inevitable breakdown of negotiations is causing an "extraordinarily serious situation." With the West determined to adopt a new strategy in Moscow, the prospect of progress remains uncertain. Therefore, the purpose of the three-power discussions in London is to draft a countermeasure to deal with the situation should the Moscow talks collapse. Britain and France are both reluctant to refer the matter to the United Nations, asserting that they should deal with Moscow with extreme patience and insist on direct negotiations. Now that patience is nearing exhaustion, it is widely believed that the three countries have agreed in principle to submit the case to the UN General Assembly on September 21. It is particularly emphasized here that the Western three powers have decided on their course of action after the failure of final measures, "and are completely united." A Western spokesman said, "There is no doubt about our firm attitude. This is not an appeal to Stalin. The situation has gone far beyond that point. It is now a showdown." Moscow may now recognize that the opinions expressed by Stalin and Molotov in Moscow are quite incompatible with Sokolovsky's actions in Berlin. The general public is extremely pessimistic about the entire situation. Public opinion is increasingly alarmed by the stalemate in the Berlin talks. Foreign Secretary Bevin is expected to issue a comprehensive statement on the progress of the negotiations. It is believed here that the Moscow talks should not be allowed to flounder as they have in the past, so the West is informing the Soviet Union in the most direct language that the time has come. An external spokesman said, "The Western three powers have agreed on the next step regarding the Berlin situation," but did not disclose the nature of the "next step," but said that relevant news would be released soon. The spokesman also said that it was not the case that the three countries had previously disagreed, but that in the early stages of negotiations, it was of course impossible for the three countries to be absolutely identical. The "Committee of Three" in London does not plan to hold a meeting on the 13th, but the French Ambassador Massigli has had talks with external officials.

### The Soviet Union Plans to Use the Old Trick Against Czechoslovakia; Attempt to Usurp Political Power in Berlin; Using Balloons and Anti-Aircraft Guns to Obstruct Anglo-American Airlifts

[United Press Berlin, 13th] A British-licensed newspaper reported on the 13th that Soviet leaders have drafted a plan to have communist action groups seize political power in Berlin on a specific date designated "Day X," after the U.S. presidential election in November. Prior to this, official reports indicated that the Soviet Union, in addition to conducting air force exercises, is using anti-aircraft fire, blocking balloons, and strong, dazzling searchlights to obstruct the American airlift to Berlin. The American newspaper "Monday Echo" claims that the Soviet Union is currently launching a provocative campaign, and then, under the pretext of maintaining order, will come forward to seize power.

It also stated that Soviet officials told the Communist Party that the Soviet Union does not intend to reach an agreement with Western countries regarding Berlin or Germany, "as this would hinder the process of the people's democratic state transforming into a proletarian dictatorship." The newspaper stated, "The Communist Party will do its utmost to exacerbate the situation in Berlin, and then, under the pretext of having the actual responsibility of protecting public order, will conceal its conspiracy to seize power." It further stated that the Berlin action group will be organized in the manner of the Czech action group in February.

### Yu Hung-chun Reports on the Use of U.S. Aid

(Continued from Page Two) (C) The method of oil utilization has now been agreed upon: (1) The current quota and extra-quota import system will continue. (2) The current allocation methods for aviation fuel, diesel, and fuel oil will continue. (3) The quantitative allocation of gasoline for automobiles in Shanghai will continue in the current manner, and the same will be done in other places. (4) Kerosene, engine oil, lubricating oil, etc., will now be sold by oil companies through their agents. (5) The selling price will be determined with reference to cost and exchange rates, ensuring that it is realistic and taking into account the costs of public utilities. (6) Oil importers are allowed to operate U.S. aid oil, but they must comply with the principle of supply economics. Once customs declaration, oil withdrawal, and price determination are completed, implementation is planned accordingly. It is also estimated that 60% of U.S. aid oil will be supplied to transportation and public utilities, and the remaining 40% will be used for general consumption. (D) Fertilizer: Of the 100,000 tons of U.S. aid fertilizer, the following distribution methods have only been decided: (1) Approximately 40,000 tons of fertilizer will be sold on the Chinese mainland through private merchants. (2) A quantity of no more than 10,000 tons of fertilizer will be reserved for use by the Chinese Rural Reconstruction Commission. The plan will be submitted by the association to the Economic Cooperation Administration for review in October. (3) Approximately 50,000 tons of fertilizer will be temporarily reserved for purchasing rice in Taiwan for emergency food storage. (4) If the fertilizer reserved in the second or third item is not used effectively and there is a surplus, it will be sold through private merchants. (5) Fertilizer is exclusively for food production, and priority should be given to rice production. The above is the most recent decision made by both parties, but in order to facilitate implementation, the first batch of fertilizer will be concentrated in Taiwan for a trial run.

Regarding the U.S. aid to our reconstruction and construction plan, it was originally planned to lend US$60 million specifically for reconstruction and construction, plus US$10 million for industrial supplementary equipment, which belonged to the aforementioned donation item. After the Stoolman investigation team conducted a wide-ranging industrial survey and research, it was believed that the greatest current need of our country's industry was the accessories required for industry. Therefore, the industrial equipment accessories and the reconstruction and construction special funds were changed to US$35 million each, reducing the number of loans and increasing the number of donations. , which is more convenient for me. Among the various applications for assistance, we are trying our best to select appropriate targets, and the following have been selected: (1) Kailan Mining Bureau, (2) Yangzi Power Company, (3) Tianjin Power Plant, (4) Taiwan Sugar Company. The four units are the first recipients of assistance, and the amount of assistance totals US$4.4 million, because the above four companies occupy an important position in our country's industry and are closely related to people's livelihoods, so they should be assisted first. As for continued assistance and how to distribute it, the government has sent Yan Jiagan, a member of the committee, together with Stu Li Men to fly to the United States on the 4th of this month to participate in the meeting of the US Economic Cooperation Administration to discuss and make a decision.

Organization of the Utilization Committee

Here is a brief report on the organization of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee. The U.S. Aid Utilization Committee is subordinate to the Executive Yuan. In addition to the committee working in cooperation with the U.S. Economic Cooperation Branch in Beijing and Shanghai, offices are also set up in Ping, Tianjin, Qing, and Sui. In view of the fact that the organizational structure of several material processing agencies in the past was huge and the expenses were huge, we strive to be compact and flexible. , only as a decision-making and supervisory implementation agency, and not directly involved in business. All imported materials are sold by the competent authorities, (for example, food is entrusted to local civil food allocation committees for storage and sale), so the number of people in all departments, offices, offices and subcommittees below the committee is less than 200, and their treatment is in accordance with the government's promulgated public servants' treatment methods, which are no different from those of employees of general state-owned enterprises, and most of the staff at all levels are borrowed from relevant institutions, so the expenses are not large. For this reason, the U.S. government established the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration to contact the U.S. aid affairs with European and Asian aid-receiving countries. The Chinese Branch of the U.S. Resident Office is presided over by Mr. Lai Louhan. Our committee maintains close contact with the Chinese Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration and has held joint meetings. In order to cooperate with the U.S. measures, we have sent a technical delegation to the U.S. capital to contact the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration and other institutions at any time. In addition, the US Aid Association will join forces with relevant and competent agencies to form food, cotton, petroleum and other subcommittees to hold regular meetings to review the material distribution policies and related issues.

The above report gives a general overview of the use of U.S. aid. Before the report concludes, I would like to specifically mention the government's self-help plan in coordination with U.S. aid. During Dean Zhang's tenure, the Ten Guidelines for Self-Help have been promulgated. Now, Dean Weng has announced new economic measures, issued new currency, and promulgated emergency financial measures. All of the above are ironclad evidence of the government's implementation of a strong self-help plan in accordance with bilateral agreements. , which is also a very effective way to coordinate U.S. aid and stabilize the economy. We firmly believe that self-reliance combined with U.S. aid, and U.S. aid will help achieve self-reliance, is the true meaning of U.S. aid. Today we are facing the most serious juncture. Under the great goal of suppressing bandits and quelling the chaos, both military and economic affairs have become critical to success or failure. The dynamics of the economy directly affect the daily lives of every citizen. The importance of U.S. aid today is self-evident. Please comrades, give more supervision so that this U.S. aid can achieve the best results.

### Long-Term Stabilization of Prices; Strive to Increase Production; Important Meeting of the Management and Supervision Office

[Our Dispatch] The Management and Supervision Office held an extremely important internal meeting yesterday afternoon, personally presided over by Chiang Ching-kuo, with many experts and key personnel in attendance. According to attendees: the discussions were not about the branch technical problems of implementation, but about the direction of the entire economic control. The most important point is that for the long-term stability of prices, Shanghai's production not only needs to continue, but also needs to be expanded. The "August 19" price limit decision will be maintained, but if, due to the price limit, there is a work stoppage or factory closures, the state will take over to ensure that production can continue. The raw materials currently stored in factories can be maintained without difficulty for one or two years. The problem is that some factories would rather hoard raw materials than produce, and this must be corrected. Secondly, foreign exchange and import policies were also discussed in detail at the meeting. It was deeply felt that most of our country's past imports were luxury goods such as private cars and nylon stockings, which were an unnecessary waste of national foreign exchange. In the future, we will import as much production equipment as possible. If the operators suffer losses as a result, the government can provide subsidies if necessary. Regarding the implementation of comprehensive rationing, there have been many discussions in the past, but it has not yet been materialized. The current first step is to use the power of the government to make the supply of daily necessities more and more sufficient. In the future, the attitude towards industry and commerce is to crack down on excessive profits and protect its legitimate profits. Therefore, in addition to maintaining the continued production of large industries, it will fully support small and medium-sized enterprises. The above points were only discussed on the original plan at the meeting, and detailed implementation plans will be formulated later.

(2) To start performing tasks in accordance with Article 13 of the Management Regulations, first regularly convene representatives of industrial and commercial groups to hold talks, announce laws and regulations, encourage them to declare and register within the time limit, and provide guidance and assistance at any time. (3) The office of the committee is located in the municipal government. Before December 31 of this year, any information received regarding those who conceal foreign exchange assets will be used as the target for responsible persuasion to declare and register. (4) Universally notify various companies, firms, societies and countries (all of the above are legal entities) and individuals that all foreign exchange assets stored abroad as of August 20 of this year only need to be declared and registered in accordance with the law, and the process of how they held this foreign exchange in the past will not be questioned. In accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the Registration Measures, the deposits that have been declared and registered and transferred to the Central Bank or its entrusted banks can be used for the following purposes respectively: (1) legitimate purposes approved by the Ministry of Finance, (2) use import permits to pay for import goods, (3) Exchange for gold yuan or purchase the Republic of China 36-year U.S. dollar bonds or government gold yuan bonds to be issued in the future. However, if illegal acts such as private foreign exchange smuggling are discovered after August 20, they will be severely punished. After the meeting, the committee members told reporters that once the representative of the Ministry of Finance clearly announced the attitude of holding the declaration and registration to the heads of various industrial and commercial groups and important companies in the coming days, it is expected that all industries will be very active in declaring within the time limit, and the amount will not be too small.

[Our Report] The third session of the seventh general meeting of the City Council was held at 3:50 p.m. yesterday in the auditorium of the council. One hundred and forty-six councilors were present, and Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Shen, and more than 20 heads of bureaus and departments attended. Yesterday's meeting discussed various proposals on finance, police affairs, public works, land administration, and proposals submitted by the speaker and the mayor, as well as the budget and final accounts committee. The entire process was smooth, and most of the proposals were successfully passed in accordance with the review opinions, making it the quietest atmosphere in the history of the council. The meeting was completed on time at 7:00 p.m. The fourth meeting will be held at 3:00 p.m. today to continue discussing proposals on education, public utilities, civil affairs, and health. Among the various proposals passed yesterday, the most important one was the mayor's proposal "to re-draft the city's property tax and municipal construction tax collection methods for currency reform." During the discussion, Zhao Yangxiong, the convener of the Finance Review Committee, first reported on the review process, and Wang Naixu, the convener of the Budget and Final Accounts Review Committee, reported on the review process. Then, Tian Yongqian, the director of the Finance Bureau, explained its importance. Director Tian began with the first sentence: "I have been in office for 18 months, and today is the first time I have asked you for help." He listed that the property tax rates levied by the old Public Works Bureau and the French Concession Board of Directors before the war were higher than the current adjustment rate. He said: "I have always prioritized the burden on citizens, but today, the property tax has to be adjusted. The municipal government has been losing money for months, and the central government will not subsidize it, so the salaries of public education personnel cannot be allocated." After Director Tian finished speaking, Councilors Jiang Jizhou, Jiang Hao, Shi Zongde, Yu Shun, Qu Yue and others put forward amendments to the original method. After Speaker Pan summarized them, the revised methods were passed as follows: property tax and municipal construction tax are collected together, and the tax rate is based on the re-estimated total value of the houses as the tax base. The tax rate is 14 per thousand for commercial houses and 8 per thousand for residential houses per year (half for property tax and half for municipal construction tax). According to the above-mentioned revised methods, the Finance Bureau will still revise the detailed collection rules and submit them to the council for review, and implement them from the autumn of this year. As for another proposal submitted by the mayor, which was a letter sending the city's revised four-month budget book of revenue and expenditure from September to December for review and reply, it was successfully passed after the review opinions revised by the small group, and did not cause debate.

### Theater Industry Requests Adjustment of Ticket Prices, Social Affairs Bureau Will Consult with Jiang Jingguo

[This Newspaper] Representatives of the city's Peking opera, Yue opera, and other theater industries went to the Social Affairs Bureau again yesterday to request an investigation into ticket prices. Their reason is that the actors invited to perform on stage after the autumn are generally larger than the package silver of the actors performing in the summer. Different actors, increased expenses, so ticket prices cannot be based on 819. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that this is an overall problem related to government laws and regulations, and will consult with Supervisor Jiang to resolve it. Xin Guang, Empire and other theaters that originally showed movies have changed to Yue opera after the autumn, and the ticket prices have been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau respectively. Lan Xin has recently performed a drama, and the ticket prices have also been decided. As for Yan Huizhu's performance of Peking opera at the China Grand Theater, the Social Affairs Bureau did not allow the ticket prices to be adjusted because Li Wanchun also performed Peking opera at the theater in the previous period. The Great Shanghai Cinema will soon have Yuan Xuefen perform the Yue opera "Coral Introduction" and show the Yue opera movie "Sister Xianglin". The highest ticket price for the two plays will be set at 1.8 gold yuan.

### Private Currency Exchange to Purchase Indian Cotton: Special Criminal Court Indicts Rong Hongyuan; Zhang Yamin Received Bribes in June to Conceal the Crime

[Our Newspaper] Rong Hongyuan, general manager of the Shenxin Textile Corporation, and others, were indicted yesterday by Special Criminal Court Prosecutor Li Yulong after a swift investigation into their private foreign exchange dealings. The original indictment is transcribed below: Defendant Rong Hongyuan, 43 years old, from Wuxi, residing at 186 Seymour Road. In custody. Chen Yuanzhi, Lu Jinzhang, and Pan Yaowen, the above three are at large. The case of the above-named defendants, No. 309 of the Republic of China year 37 for engaging in foreign exchange business, has been investigated and concluded, and it is deemed that prosecution should be initiated. The facts of the crime, evidence, and applicable laws are listed below: (1) Facts of the crime: Rong Hongyuan, as the general manager of the Shanghai Shenxin Textile Corporation, signed a contract with Shanghai Shenghong Foreign Firm on May 20, 1948, to purchase 1,500 bales of Indian cotton, totaling 735,000 rupees, due to a shortage of raw materials. It was stipulated that an initial deposit equivalent to HK$189,650 would be paid, to be received by the Hong Kong Kelai Zhen Foreign Firm as a representative, and that the full amount would be paid after the company shipped 17,450 bolts of Shuangxi brand cotton cloth to Hong Kong for sale.

Unable to Borrow, Illicit Currency Exchange

Due to the urgent deadline for the deposit, Rong Hongyuan twice instructed Chen Yuanzhi, the company's representative in Hong Kong, to borrow from the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank. Chen Yuanzhi, unable to secure a loan, then asked Pan Yaowen, an employee of the bank, to purchase HK$189,650 in Shanghai foreign exchange for the dates of June 1st and 2nd, 1948, from Daoheng Foreign Exchange, which specializes in foreign exchange business. This amount was converted into 41 billion legal tender, designated to be received by seven firms including Tang Yaoan in Shanghai. After receiving the telegram from Chen Yuanzhi relayed by Lu Jinzhang, Rong Hongyuan dispatched Lu Jinzhang to deliver 8 billion legal tender to Tang Yaoan, 6 billion legal tender to Gong Chongrui, 13 billion legal tender to Lin Siping, 3 billion legal tender to Liang Qianli, 3 billion legal tender to Li Shiying, 2 billion legal tender to Zhou De, and 3 billion legal tender to Guanghua Firm. Rong Hongyuan could not remember where the remaining 3 billion legal tender was exchanged.

Airmail Letter, Detailing Addresses

Afterward, Chen Yuanzhi sent an airmail letter listing the detailed locations of the seven firms, including Tang Yaoan, and the amounts to be paid, to Rong Hongyuan for verification. This letter was seized by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, photographed, and handed over to the Shanghai Police Department, which arrested and transferred Rong Hongyuan for investigation. (2) Evidence and applicable laws: It has been confirmed that Rong Hongyuan, in the name of the Shenxin Textile Corporation, ordered 1,500 bales of Indian cotton from Shenghong Foreign Firm, and after receiving Chen Yuanzhi's notice regarding the required deposit of HK$189,650 in Hong Kong, dispatched Lu Jinzhang to deliver a total of 41 billion legal tender to seven firms including Tang Yaoan. Furthermore, there is a photograph of Chen Yuanzhi's airmail letter and the contract with Shenghong Foreign Firm on file as evidence, making the facts of the crime clear.

### Although Claiming to Maintain Credit, He Should Have Telegraphed to Prevent It

Although it was argued: "Because the company lacked raw materials, I contacted the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank to borrow the deposit. Chen Yuanzhi purchased Shanghai foreign exchange without my consent. To maintain Shenxin's credit, I had no choice but to pay." However, it is found that the defendant, Rong Hongyuan, knowing that Chen Yuanzhi had purchased Shanghai foreign exchange, should have telegraphed to prevent it and return the deposit. Instead, he used the excuse of maintaining commercial credit and instructed Lu Jinzhang, who relayed the foreign exchange telegram, to deliver the payment. It is clear that he should bear the responsibility for engaging in foreign exchange business jointly with Chen Yuanzhi, Pan Yaowen, and Lu Jinzhang. He cannot be excused on the grounds that he procured raw materials for production and purchased Shanghai foreign exchange.

In summary, the defendants Rong Hongyuan and others have indeed violated the regulations for punishing the buying and selling of gold and foreign currencies, and the Central Bank's foreign exchange control regulations. Therefore, this public prosecution is initiated.

As for the seven firms, including Tang Yaoan, involved in the Rong case, the court will open a separate hearing for investigation and registration.

### Zhang Yamin Discovered and Extorted a Large Sum

There is an interesting episode in the Rong case. Rong Hongyuan's illicit currency exchange was discovered by Zhang Yamin, the former chief of the Economic Section of the Garrison Headquarters, on June 2nd. Zhang photographed the evidence and used it to extort a large sum from Rong, and thus the matter was suppressed. Later, Zhang was arrested for corruption and sentenced to death. Rong was also imprisoned. This exchange between Rong and Zhang was successively discovered in their confessions. This fact sufficiently explains why the Rong case occurred in early June but was only subjected to legal sanctions now.

### British-Owned Trolleybuses in Shanghai Briefly "Slashed Prices"; Autumn Festival Issue Awaits Mediation

[Our Newspaper] Before last year's Mid-Autumn Festival, employees of the British-owned trolleybus company borrowed half a month's salary from the company, to be repaid in installments. With this year's Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, employees have been requesting to borrow salary as usual. The union decided at a meeting on September 5th to request the company to advance 20 days' salary for the festival, to be repaid over four months. The company stated it could not afford to lend, resulting in a deadlock. As a result, employees' emotions were high. This morning, employees drove the buses out of the factory as usual, but ticket sellers implemented a "price slash," charging a flat rate of 100,000 legal tender regardless of distance. The union's persuasion was ineffective. At 10:30 AM, the union chairman Qiu Changjiang and others went to the Social Affairs Bureau to report the situation to Deputy Director Zhao. Mayor Wu was also informed and instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to order the workers to immediately restore normal operations. The Social Affairs Bureau issued an emergency order, and union leaders returned to persuade the workers. By 11:35 AM, all trolleybus lines had resumed normal ticket sales, awaiting mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. According to employees, the company's daily income before last month's currency reform was around 40 billion legal tender, and recently, income has been good, averaging around 60 billion legal tender daily. Employees' salaries have not increased, and the management's claim of being unable to advance salaries is clearly a pretext.

### National Treasures in Chengde: Zhou Bronze Sacrificial Vessels; Two Out of Ten Missing

— Our Reporter Xing Ruofeng

[Chengde Airmail Report, 7th] This mountain city of Chengde, because it was the summer retreat of the former Manchu emperors, still has many relics. Although it has been baptized by artillery fire and undergone great changes, outsiders still visit the "Eight Great Temples." Locals enjoy reminiscing about the past. It is said that when the emperor resided here and officials came and went, many precious treasures were kept in the summer palace of the Mountain Resort, the Ten Scenic Spots, and the Outer Eight Temples. After the Eight-Nation Alliance looted the so-called "Inner Court" treasures in Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion in the late Qing Dynasty, most of the treasures from Rehe were transported to Beijing to replenish the "Inner Court" for display. The remaining treasures were later moved into the Rehe Treasure Museum (located within the Summer Resort). During the twenty years of warlord rule, the treasures in the museum decreased with time. During the occupation period, the Japanese managed the museum for over a decade. It is said that the Japanese made the Treasure Museum look very presentable after much research, but in reality, some of the items were replaced with forgeries. Among the most precious and fortunately preserved treasures were only ten Zhou bronze sacrificial vessels, simply called the "Ten Zhou Bronzes."

Zhou Bronze Archaeology

According to the analysis of archaeologists and the records in the "Chengde Prefecture Records," the "Ten Zhou Bronzes" are indeed rare national treasures. After the "August 15th" surrender of the Japanese, Soviet troops entered Chengde from northern China. Order was lost, and all cultural relics were thrown into chaos. From that time on, the "Ten Zhou Bronzes" disappeared amidst the turmoil. The Eighth Route Army occupied Chengde for a year, and of course, no one talked about this matter. It was not until the National Army recovered Chengde in the autumn of 1946 that the story of the Zhou bronzes was brought up again.

Treasure Names

At that time, suspicion about the whereabouts of these ten national treasures was inevitable, and everyone thought it would be difficult to recover them intact. However, Fan Jian, the then magistrate of Chengde County, found seven of them. The provincial government reported to the central government, and Magistrate Fan was awarded a commendation for his efforts. The names of the seven recovered treasures are: (1) Zhou Pan-Wen Hu (2) Ju Lei-Wen Hu, (3) Zhou Shu-Zhen (missing base), (4) Zhou Bin Zun, (5) Zhou Su Xi, (6) Zhou Dang-Wen Jue, and (7) Zhou Pan-Wen Yan (missing lid). In addition to these items, there are three that have not yet been found, namely (8) Zhou King Wen Ding, (9) Zhou Meng Feng You, and (10) Zhou Chan-Wen Gui.

"Wenwang Ding"

The seven treasures mentioned above had already been transported to Beiping by the provincial government during the Chengde defense war this summer for safekeeping. The remaining three, however, remained missing. Unexpectedly, the military recently discovered a "King Wen Ding," which is truly "unexpectedly fortuitous." The ding was sent to the Provincial Assembly for unified safekeeping on the 5th by General Shi Jue of the Sui District. The Provincial Assembly convened an appraisal meeting on the 6th, attended by many local elders, who carefully distinguished and determined that the treasure was indeed the King Wen Ding. The ding was measured on the spot, weighing six catties and seven taels (new scale of ten taels), with a total height of 25.3 centimeters, ear height of 4.4, ear width of 4.4, abdominal depth of 9.5, mouth length of 16.5, mouth width of 12.5, and leg height of 12.2. After the appraisal, it was tagged, and the attendees stamped their seals as proof, and then sent it to the provincial government for storage. They also jointly sent a letter thanking Commander Shi Jue, requesting that the original discoverer be given a commendation for his meritorious service.

So far, only two of the "Ten Zhou Bronzes" are missing. A local elder said: "The Ten Zhou Bronzes are national treasures passed down for more than three thousand years. Now that eight have been found, the discovery of the remaining two must not be far off."

### Autumn Festival Comfort for Troops, Energetic Preparations in Nanjing and Zhenjiang

[Our Report from Zhenjiang, 13th] With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, all sectors of society in Zhenjiang are preparing to comfort the veterans and stationed troops.

[Another Telegram] Since the launch of the comfort-the-troops-with-cloth-shoes campaign, the response from all parties has been enthusiastic. After Chinese women in the Philippines donated funds to Madame Chiang to produce 18,000 pairs of cloth shoes, the wives of the heads of military institutions in the capital have also responded enthusiastically. Those who have already donated include: Madame He Yingqin, wife of Minister of National Defense, 250 pairs; Madame Zhu Tong, wife of Chief of General Staff Gu, 200 pairs; Madame Yu Hanmou, wife of Commander-in-Chief of the Army Yu, 100 pairs; Madame Gui Yongqing, wife of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Gui, 100 pairs; Madame Guo Chan, wife of Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Forces Guo, 100 pairs; Madame Sun Lianzhong, wife of Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison Command Sun, 100 pairs; Madame Li and Lan, wife of Deputy Minister of National Defense Li, 50 pairs. The wives of other leaders are also donating successively.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The comfort-the-troops-with-cloth-shoes campaign is being launched nationwide. In order to expand the response, all sectors of the capital have specifically organized a prize-winning entertainment event from the 17th to the 19th. Beijing artists will participate in performances of Peking opera, spoken drama, Yue opera, variety shows, etc. Civilians can exchange a pair of cloth shoes or one Gold Yuan for a ticket to enter the venue.

[Our Report] On the night of the 8th, the earthen dikes along the southern beach of Xinwan, Toupeng, were suddenly breached by a storm surge, causing more than 5,000 mu of cotton fields and cotton crops to be submerged.

Hefei

[Our Report] The Anhui provincial land tax will still be collected in kind this year, as decided by the central government, and it is stipulated to collect three and borrow four. However, fellow villagers in Beijing believe it is too heavy and only allow collecting three and borrowing one. After repeated meetings in Beijing, no solution has been reached. Liao Ziying, the newly appointed director of the Provincial Grain Bureau, proposed a compromise solution of collecting three and borrowing one and a half, but the central government and Anhui gentry did not accept it, resulting in the current stalemate, and there is no confirmed date for the commencement of the collection.

Letter to the Editor

We recently received a letter from Liao Bin, a former judge of the Qingpu County Judicial Office, stating: "After reading the reports on the autopsy of Shen Pang Guiying in the September 4th and 8th newspapers, there are many inaccuracies. (1) Shen's body was repeatedly examined by inspectors sent by the office, and Su Gao Jianchu was instructed by Bin to approve the dispatch of forensic doctor Xuan Fang for a re-examination. It was not requested by the supervising delegation. (2) Shen Weiting's confession that Yan had demanded travel expenses was deemed to have received improper benefits, and Su Gao Jianchu was immediately notified by telegram to hand it over for investigation or transfer jurisdiction. It was then instructed by this county to handle the case. At the time of his discharge, he transferred the case, and the clerk Chen Guangchong was suspected of another crime and was immediately notified to Gao Jianchu and presented to the court for approval. Bin did not detain those who were assigned to various personnel due to slight criminal suspicions at the time, but had already reported the case first. (3) Bin requested to resign early, and was replaced by Wang Jiyuan, who was appointed by the court on July 26, while the Shen case was accepted on July 29. How could he leave his post due to handling this case? I would like to make a initial inquiry as a prosecutor and not conclude it, so I would bear the false name of indulgence and have no rumors. The matter is related to legal reputation, dare not declare, ask to correct."

### Serious Situation in Southern Yunnan: Deserted Soldiers Resist Paying Taxes and Suppressing Rebels; County Councilors Telegraph the Province Calling for Help

[Our Report from Kunming, 13th] The three towns of Lancang Mengyun in southern Yunnan, which border Myanmar, have been occupied by deserted soldiers of the former 93rd Division. They are forcibly conscripting militiamen within the occupied area and resisting the payment of taxes and the suppression of rebels, and are threatening to advance into other towns. Shi Bingjun, a member of the county council, has telegraphed the province calling for troops to quell the rebellion. It is rumored that the cause of the rebellion was a disagreement between Mengyun Town Mayor Shi Binglin and local gentry Liu Shaohong. After Liu killed Shi Binglin, he recruited deserters from the former 93rd Division to occupy the area in an attempt to resist the central government. Both sides are preparing for a large-scale armed conflict, and the situation is quite serious. Note: Mengyun was formerly under the jurisdiction of the Menglian Chief Secretary during the Qing Dynasty. After the abolition of the native chieftain system and the establishment of direct rule, it was divided into three towns, located on the southwestern border of Lancang.

### Sentiments on the Third Anniversary of the Re-establishment of this Bureau

— Yu Bingjian Sun Hongjun

Time flies, and another autumn has arrived. Since the re-establishment of this bureau, three years have passed. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we are reminded of the dangers of thin ice as we celebrate this festival. We still remember the initial broadcast of victory songs, and the re-emergence of glory. The authorities, recognizing the importance of telecommunications, instructed Bingjian and others to first connect the telecommunications business between Shanghai and Chongqing and Chengdu, setting an example for Zu Ti and paving the way for repatriation. Later, we were ordered to take over the telecommunications business in Shanghai from the stubborn enemy. Various matters were complex and tedious. Although they are now past events, they should be a glorious page in the history of telecommunications in our country, and they are also sufficient to highlight the importance of telecommunications to the nation and society!

Three years of hard work should have yielded results, but due to a shortage of resources, we often find it difficult to fulfill our wishes. Business expansion naturally has many effects. However, in terms of engineering construction and business facilities, we have tried our best to move forward. For example, the increase in telephone and telegraph equipment, the construction of receiving stations, and the training of telecommunications personnel have all been carried out by this bureau with limited resources. Similarly, the innovation of business, the increase in speed, and the pursuit of universal and thorough service are constantly being improved in accordance with the instructions of our superiors. Fortunately, after years of effort, we have made some progress. This is due to the efforts of our colleagues and the enthusiastic cooperation of people from all walks of life.

Speaking of this bureau's future work plan, we will continue to adhere to our original intentions, engaging in the construction of telephone and telegraph equipment and the improvement of business facilities. The cultivation of a good service spirit among our staff is also one of the central tasks for the future. Our concern is that our income is insufficient, which is now even more serious. Replenishing equipment is especially difficult. We will carefully consider the urgency of the situation, assess the burden of financial resources, and proceed step by step in order to achieve our goals. Business facilities should be further improved in terms of speed, accuracy, and convenience, in order to achieve the goal of universal service and to promote the expression of a good service spirit among our colleagues. Bingjian and Hongjun have responsibilities, and we dare not fail to encourage our colleagues to work together. We still hope that advanced and virtuous people will provide guidance at any time to correct our shortcomings. We would be very grateful.

### Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

— General Overview of Engineering

The implementation of construction plans relies on transportation as a precursor, and telecommunications is the transportation of transportation, the significance of its mission is self-evident. China's telecommunications industry has been established for more than sixty years. From its initial establishment to its basic scale, it has suffered from the obstruction of internal unrest and the devastation of foreign aggression. After several difficult operations and continuous improvements, in terms of equipment, it has advanced from Morse machines to teletypewriters and facsimile telegraph machines, or from magneto telephones to automatic telephone machines, and even to carrier telephone machines, reaching a prosperous state. Shanghai is a major commercial port, the hub of transportation, occupying a primary position, and its equipment should be particularly complete. Since the victory, three years have passed. Recalling these three years, due to the simplicity of the enemy's remaining telecommunications machinery and the lack of materials, coupled with the scarcity of foreign exchange support, replenishment was not easy, resulting in great difficulties in the reorganization and expansion of telecommunications equipment. Fortunately, with the earnest supervision of superiors and the concerted efforts of colleagues, we have strived to overcome obstacles. Therefore, based on the principle of reviewing the past and encouraging the future, we will present a general overview of the Bureau's engineering, highlighting the most important aspects, and summarize them in a record, which we believe will be welcomed by those concerned about telecommunications.

Central Office

The central office is located upstairs in the main business office at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Sichuan Road, serving as the nerve center for transmitting and receiving machine parts. Telegraphs are concentrated here. "Outgoing telegrams" received by the business office are transmitted to the telegraph room via a delivery device. A perforating machine is used to connect consecutive small holes on oiled paper strips, word by word. The perforated paper strips are loaded onto an automatic transmitter or teletypewriter to send signal currents. This current is transmitted to the transmitting station via remote control equipment for transmission. Signal radio waves sent from the other party are first received by the receiving station and also transmitted to the central office via remote control equipment. After amplification, they are recorded as codes by a wave recorder (or manual machine) or directly typed into text by a teletypewriter. Therefore, the central office integrates transmitting and receiving machines in one place, maintaining contact with various locations at any time, reaching far and wide. The Bureau's central office currently has twenty-four teletypewriters, twenty automatic transmitters, three sound machines, twenty-one manual machines, two twelve-channel carrier machines, four four-channel carrier machines, and thirty-eight amplifiers. The number of amplifiers is still insufficient for application and expansion is planned, with an estimated increase to forty-five units within the year. The central office also has an attached repair shop, equipped with machine tools such as lathes, drilling machines, grinding wheels, as well as high-frequency oscillators, universal meters, vacuum tube voltmeters, and circuit testers. When mechanical failures occur, they can be repaired within fifteen minutes.

Transmitting Station

There are five transmitting stations: Nanxiang, Hongkou, Jianguo West Road, Fuxing Island, and Fuzhou Road. Nanxiang is the largest in scale, covering an area of more than two hundred acres, and is the transmitting center of domestic wireless telegraphy. The Bureau currently has forty-four transmitters, the largest being 3KW and the smallest being 200W, of which five are used for voice transmission, and the rest are dedicated to telegraph transmission. As for transmitting antennas, after three years of reorganization and expansion, there are thirty directional antennas and twenty-six non-directional antennas. It is planned to add four directional antennas within the year to improve communication efficiency. Due to the importance of the Nanxiang station, it has its own 125KVA oil engine generator, which is sufficient for the entire station's usage. In the event of a city power outage, it can be started at any time to avoid interruptions. The working conditions of remote control and transmitters are also displayed with indicators, which can be seen at a glance. The Nanxiang transmitting station also has an attached repair shop, equipped with machine tools such as lathes and drilling machines, which can adequately handle its own machine repair and parts work.

Receiving Station

The Bureau currently uses the Zhabei receiving station as the main receiving station, covering an area of dozens of acres. In addition to the Fuzhou Road, Hongkou, Fuxing Island, and Xikang Road stations, which also have several receiving machines, there is also a portion attached to the Liuheng receiving station of the International Wireless Radio Station. The Bureau currently has ten diversity receiving machines and forty-nine single machines. Because the Liuheng station has a larger area, all diversity receiving machines are located there. In order to expand its business, the Bureau has purchased one hundred acres of land in Qibao in the suburbs to build a new receiving station to meet the needs. According to the planned schedule, it will be built in three phases. The first phase of the project has now been completed, and it is expected to be fully operational by next spring. The laying of remote control cables is currently underway and will be completed soon.

Facsimile Machine Room

Facsimile telegraphs can be classified into two types: photographic telegraphs and true handwriting telegraphs. The former can transmit photographs to the other party via electrical energy. The receiving film at the other end still needs to be developed and printed using photographic techniques. The latter can transmit handwritten text or charts to the other party via electrical energy, directly receiving a vivid reproduction of the original. The Bureau's facsimile telegraph machine is a true handwriting telegraph machine, currently only one unit, dedicated to communication with Nanjing. It usually uses a loaded-line carrier circuit for transmission. When the loaded-line condition is unstable, it can be switched to a wired circuit at any time, so it is extremely good and reliable. The special nature of Chinese characters means that the alphabetic spelling method cannot be adopted, so ordinary telegrams must first translate the characters into telegraph codes and send them to the other party, who then translates the codes back into characters. This not only involves overly complex procedures and wastes time, but also inevitably leads to errors. Now, the use of this true handwriting telegraph machine can not only increase the transmission speed, but also guarantee absolute accuracy, and is a new equipment worth promoting.

Long-Distance Telephone Room

The long-distance telephone room is located on the third floor of the Bureau's Hongkou building, serving as the hub of the country's long-distance telephone network. When users make a call, the recording desk registers it first, and then the long-distance desk connects them one by one in order. For the purpose of assessing the performance of the staff, a monitoring desk is also set up to monitor their work at any time. In total, there are currently six recording desk positions, one monitoring desk position, two long-distance dedicated line desk positions, twenty-four wired long-distance desk positions, and four wireless long-distance desk positions. Another room has been opened next door, equipped with four international long-distance desk positions, dedicated to long-distance calls to countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Cuba. In recent years, the long-distance telephone business has developed rapidly, and the existing equipment is insufficient for application and expansion is urgently needed. Sixty long-distance desk positions have been ordered from the United States to meet the needs of business expansion.

Wireless Telephone Terminal Equipment Room

The function of the terminal equipment room is similar to that of the central office for telegraphs, serving as the nerve center for loaded-line telephone communication. The voice signal sent by the user must be transmitted from the long-distance desk to the transmitting station via the terminal equipment for transmission. The signal received by the receiving station from the other party must also first pass through the terminal equipment and then be transferred to the long-distance desk before being transmitted to the user's earpiece. Its function can prevent conflicts between transmitting and receiving. In addition, because the terminal equipment has an amplification function and can adjust the volume, preventing "feedback" (Reed Oack) from causing "singing", its function is crucial. The Bureau currently has five of these terminal equipment units. In order to meet the needs of rapid business expansion, another unit will soon be added.

Local Telephone Exchange

The Bureau's area is vast, reaching Wusong in the north, Minhang in the south, Pudong in the east, and Qibao in the west. Its wide range is unmatched by other special cities in the country. The need for local telephones is strong, but because the replenishment of materials is not easy, the service is difficult to be satisfactory. There are currently nine exchanges: Hongkou, Nanshi, City Center, Pudong, Wusong, Fuxing Island, Zhenru, Longhua, and Minhang. Except for the first three, which have enemy-destroyed machine keys that can be used, the remaining six were rebuilt or added after the victory in the past three years after raising funds for equipment. The current capacity of each exchange is listed below: Hongkou has 2,700 automatic lines; Nanshi has 2,000 automatic lines; the City Center has 600 automatic lines; Pudong has 300 manual lines; Wusong has 200 manual lines; Fuxing Island has 200 manual lines; Zhenru has 60 manual lines; Longhua has 200 manual lines; Minhang has 30 manual lines. From the above, it can be seen that the scale of each exchange is still small, so a repair shop cannot be attached to each one. Only a telephone repair shop is set up in the Hongkou exchange, and the equipment is still lacking. Recently, the Hongkou exchange is actively carrying out expansion projects, which are expected to be completed within the year. In order to take into account the needs of the western suburbs of Shanghai, the establishment of the Qibao exchange has also been planned, which may be completed within the year.

Line Equipment: The Bureau's local telephone lines are spread throughout the city, and all business districts of the exchanges described in Section (7) can be reached, with Hongkou and Nanshi being the most densely populated. There are trunk lines connecting each exchange, sufficient for frequent calls. As for telegraph remote control lines, they are centered on the central office and distributed in all directions, connecting each transmitting station and each receiving station to achieve the function of communication and transmission. The above two types of lines can be divided into three categories: overhead open wire, overhead cable, and underground cable. The Huangpu River divides the city into eastern and western districts. Communication between Pudong and Puxi relies on submarine cables for connection. The Bureau has selected sites to lay three submarine cables, dedicated to trunk lines and telephone dedicated lines. The quantities of various line equipment are summarized and listed below: a total of 8,500 wooden poles, 1,280 pair kilometers of overhead open wire, approximately 200 kilometers of overhead cable, approximately 10 kilometers of underground conduit, approximately 130 kilometers of underground cable, and approximately 3.5 kilometers of submarine cable. Recently, due to the construction of the Qibao receiving station and the Qibao exchange, the remote control line and trunk line engineering required for that area in the future have commenced and will be completed within the month.

Machine Repair and Allocation

The types of machines and the extent of equipment of the Bureau are as described above. The required parts cannot all be supplied by foreign countries, so at the beginning of the restoration, the establishment of a telecommunications machine repair and allocation office was started, with the goal of manufacturing or repairing various telecommunications machines and parts. It was first established at the site of the Xindong Motor Factory on Zhoujiazui Road in the spring of the 35th year and officially started operations in October of the same year. Later, due to the small size of the building and the simple equipment, although gradual progress was made, development was difficult to achieve. Therefore, in the autumn of the 36th year, efforts were made to recover the factory building of the former Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Machine Repair and Manufacturing Plant in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, and it was rebuilt. After several months of preparation, all the machines were moved in, including three workshops, one material warehouse, two dormitories, and one office building, along with the power room, club, dining room, and kitchen, covering an area of more than ten acres, with spare land for expanding the workshop. After several expansions and reorganizations, it has taken shape. There are currently more than sixty various large and small lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, planers, sawing machines, punching machines, universal grinders, and film rolling machines, and lettering machines. The number of machine parts produced each month is in the tens of thousands. In addition to meeting the needs of the Bureau, it also repairs machines for nearby bureaus in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other places.

Other After the Bureau's restoration, a large number of materials were required to repair old machines and lines and to supplement new equipment. However, at the beginning of the victory, Chinese and foreign shipping was not open, and the stocks of merchants in the market were almost entirely collected by the enemy puppets. Therefore, in addition to a portion of the required materials being airlifted from the rear for emergency use, only those that could be applied were selected from the enemy puppet's remaining materials to provide some support. Later, as shipping gradually opened up, in addition to the imported materials ordered from foreign countries, several batches of relief materials and surplus US military materials were allocated by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In addition, more than ten batches of enemy puppet telecommunications materials were purchased from the Enemy Puppet Property Disposal Bureau at a price. The number of the above materials was considerable, but because they belonged to military properties and were mostly incomplete, they had to be greatly repaired and modified before they could be used. In addition, the procedures for counting, storing, and distributing were cumbersome, which the original staff of the Materials Section could not handle. Therefore, a Materials Storage and Transportation Office was established, and under the orders of the Telecommunications Administration, it allocated, transported, and supplied materials to various bureaus across the country for emergency use. Later, because there was a batch of wireless radio equipment in the relief materials, most of which were surplus materials from the US Navy, the quantity was huge and the damage was particularly severe, requiring spacious warehouses and workshops and technical experts to organize them. Therefore, twelve factory buildings were built separately in Zhenru and Nanxiang, and engineers and technicians were borrowed from the International Radio Station to establish a separate organization to repair them. Since last autumn, the Ministry of Communications established a Material Requisition Committee, which, together with the Ministry of National Defense, distributed and inspected the Okinawan equipment transported by the "Material Supply Bureau." The Bureau had to assist in handling it and transferred more than ten technicians from the bureaus of Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Shaanxi, Guangdong, and Nanjing to take charge of it. As of now, the telecommunications equipment inspected, repaired, allocated, and transported to various parts of the country by the Bureau has reached more than 10,000 orders. The manpower and financial resources consumed by this work are quite considerable, and there is often a sense of being exhausted. In addition, the issuance of import passports and re-export certificates for wireless radio materials and the reorganization of radio stations are also part of the Bureau's ancillary work. The former is relatively simple in nature and involves less work. Since the victory, 130,000 radios have been imported. Among them, from the time the government opened international exchange in March of the 35th year to the time imports were restricted in the winter of that year, the import quantity reached more than 116,000 units, which is truly shocking. As for the work of reorganizing radio stations, although illegal radio stations have been repeatedly investigated, sealed, and banned, they have not yet been brought into the right track and need to be continued.

The general overview of the Bureau's engineering has been described above. Although its equipment has been expanded several times compared to the time of restoration, it is still insufficient to meet the needs of society. However, looking back over the past three years, whether it was due to a lack of manpower, financial constraints, or a lack of materials, we were overwhelmed and could not attend to everything at once. We moved forward steadily, with many difficulties, and the current somewhat satisfactory scale is all due to the supervision of our superiors and the hard work of the Bureau's more than six hundred colleagues who have worked hard for the public good. The victory of the War of Resistance has reached its third anniversary. Looking around the country, people's livelihoods are difficult and all industries are declining. Looking to the future, we are deeply encouraged. The central work for the second half of this year includes the expansion of the Hongkou exchange, the improvement of the power supply of the Nanshi exchange, the renovation of the long-distance desk, the increase of wireless telephone machines, the increase of directional antennas at the Nanxiang transmitting station, and the strengthening of power supply equipment, the enrichment of the central office equipment, the relocation of the terminal equipment room, and the construction of the Qibao receiving station and exchange. Although some of these projects are about to be completed or are being actively constructed, there are still those that are waiting for materials and have not yet been started. To promote their completion, we must work hard and are willing to take this auspicious day to record it and encourage our colleagues. We also hope that domestic experts will come forward to teach us, which would be of great benefit.

### Progress of Our Bureau's Operations

— Li Tong

It has been three years since the restoration of our bureau. During this time, the reorganization and improvement of operations have been complex and faced many obstacles. Fortunately, with the urging of the authorities, the support of all sectors of society, and the efforts of telecommunications colleagues, we have made considerable progress. The following is a brief outline of the development of the bureau's operations in recent years:

A. Telegraphs

(1) Expanding Circuits

Through two years of planning and coordination by our bureau's wireless communications department, we have actively communicated with inland areas to restore north-south communications. Major cities have direct circuits available. Recently, we have opened direct wireless circuits to Yantai, Huaining, Zhengzhou, Jinan, and other places. We have also installed teletypewriters on the Tianjin, Hangzhou, and Wuhu circuits to improve reporting efficiency. Other circuits will be opened with second or third lines as needed, depending on the situation, to alleviate telegraph traffic. Currently, our bureau has 20 wired circuits and 30 wireless circuits.

(2) Rapidly Increasing Telegraph Traffic

In the past year, the market has fluctuated frequently. Telegraph traffic has surged whenever prices fluctuate significantly. The tension and busyness of using limited manpower and equipment to cope with the unlimited increase in telegraphs can be imagined. The following is a comparison of the number of telegrams this year with last year:

(3) Maximizing Expansion of Express Telegrams

As telegraph traffic increased while circuit capacity was limited, transmission in sequence inevitably caused some delays. To meet the needs of various sectors, express telegrams were opened on important circuits. These telegrams were transmitted in advance to save time. Since its implementation, the results have been remarkable and highly praised by all sectors. After continuous discussions, the number of express telegram circuits has been increased to 26.

(4) Conducting a Telegraph Accuracy Campaign

According to statistics, last year more than 50,000 telegrams nationwide could not be delivered, with incomplete or illegible recipient names and addresses accounting for more than 30,000. To eliminate and reduce such errors, a telegraph accuracy campaign was launched this year. In addition to printing 100,000 labels to distribute to users for cooperation, we strengthened error correction and intensified spot checks. Since implementation, telegraph errors have been reduced daily, with the error percentage decreasing from 0.132% to 0.032%.

(5) Implementing Zonal Delivery

To improve the speed of telegram delivery, zonal delivery of incoming telegrams has been implemented. Incoming telegram delivery branches have been established on Zhongshan South Road and Xikang Road. Plans are underway to establish more delivery branches in important areas.

(6) Relocating Telegraph Room for Centralized Operations

The original location of our bureau's wireless telegraph operating room was on Yuyingtang Road in Zhabei, which was inconvenient for handling telegraph traffic. To centralize operations and improve efficiency, a remote-control receiving system was adopted to move the central receiving and dispatching operations. The relocation of major circuits has now been mostly completed.

(7) Establishing an Inspection Radio Station

To meet the needs of operations and the environment, an inspection radio station was established. The station's work scope is divided into two parts: broadcast inspection and communications inspection. Since its establishment, it has achieved considerable success in regulating the city's broadcasting stations and cracking down on illegal radio stations.

(8) Using Chinese Typewriters to Copy and Translate Incoming Telegrams

Ten Chinese typewriters specially for translating telegrams were added and used in wired and wireless telegraph operating rooms. Due to the limited number of machines, the speed is slightly slower. Currently, they are only used to copy and translate diplomatic telegrams and incoming telegrams from non-registered users.

(9) Conducting a Messenger Service for Collecting Return Telegrams

Messengers can also collect return telegrams when delivering telegrams. For incoming telegrams requesting a reply, the dispatching clerk adds a "Please Reply" stamp to the telegram envelope and delivers it through the messenger. After inquiry, if an immediate return telegram is required, the messenger can collect the return telegram and fees according to the procedure and bring them back to the bureau for transmission, which is very fast.

B. Telephone A. Long-Distance Telephone Services

(1) Conducting Express Telephone Callback Service

Since the opening of the express telephone service last year, the user demand has been too great, and the supply and demand gap has been too wide. To consider the connection time limit, our bureau must stop registrations from time to time. However, users often wish to register regardless of the time limit due to urgent needs. Our bureau adopted the "Express Callback" method, registering all registered users one by one and handing them over to the callback station to estimate the connection time and notify users by telephone. Since its implementation, users have been satisfied. Express telephone service between Shanghai and Tianjin, and between Shanghai and Chongqing was opened in August. Express telephone service in Wuhu, Xuzhou, Jiangdu, and other places will also be opened successively.

(2) Expanding Alternate Transmission Telephone Service

Since the opening of the alternate transmission telephone service in March last year, users have found it very convenient. Since January of this year, all bureaus with direct circuits to our bureau have opened alternate transmission services one after another.

(3) Expanding Traffic Routes to Cooperate with Long-Distance Needs

In September of last year, our bureau had 63 pairs of wired long-distance telephone circuits and wireless circuits to Qingdao, Beiping, Hankou, Tianjin, Chongqing, Taipei, Jinan, Guangzhou, and other eight places. International calls included two Sino-American wireless circuits. This year, with a shortage of equipment, we worked hard to expand the circuits, adding 14 circuits to Nanjing, Hangzhou, Bengbu, Anhui, and other places. Domestically, wireless communication locations were added in Lanzhou, Fuzhou, Kunming, and other places. Considering the busy traffic between Shanghai and Tianjin, another pair of circuits was added. International telephone service opened Sino-British wireless communication on March 1st, and communication to Mexico, Cuba, and Canada on June 1st. Communication to Honolulu is scheduled to open on September 15th, and Hong Kong wireless telephone is also in testing. The long-distance switchboard also added six seats in March.

(4) Improving Service

All long-distance telephone staff are trained in batches, imparting various business regulations, service ethics, and answering attitudes to achieve the goal of "humble attitude and thoughtful service."

B. City Telephone Business

(1) Opening Shared Line Telephone Service The supply of telephones in this city cannot meet the demand, and the replenishment of machines is slow and does not solve the urgent problem. To consider the needs of citizens, those who can negotiate the consent of users near our bureau can jointly apply to install a shared line telephone for joint use.

(2) Universally Installing Public Telephones Since the installation of telephones in various districts of this city, citizens have been able to use them everywhere. In addition to installing public telephones in appropriate locations in the urban area, our bureau has also installed suburban public telephones in Meilong, Zhenru, Dachang, Xinjing, Yinxiang Port, Longhua, Beicai, Zhangjiangzha, and other places to benefit the public.

(3) Installing Dedicated Line Telephones When prices fluctuate, the telephone traffic in this city increases, making it difficult to connect. In view of this, our bureau has persuaded all branches of institutions and factories to install dedicated line telephones so that the head office and affiliated institutions can communicate immediately, achieving the effect of fingers and arms and reducing the call rate of city telephones.

(4) Establishing a Time Reporting Station To facilitate citizens, in addition to broadcasting the Customs bell sounds at the Hongkou and Nanshi exchanges, our bureau has also established a time reporting station. Users who want to know the standard time can dial 17 to receive the report.

(5) Establishing a Service Counter The service counter specializes in answering inquiries about the arrival and departure dates and times of trains, ships, and airplanes, etc.

(1) Adding Teletype Machines to Business Offices To speed up the transmission of outgoing telegrams, last year, teletype machines were installed in the Yuyuan Road, Changzhi Road, and North Station business offices, as well as the Xin Xin Company telegraph collection office. This year, we will continue to install British machines in the North Sichuan Road and South Zhongshan Road branch offices.

(2) Simplifying Outgoing Telegram Processing Procedures The procedures for transmitting and processing outgoing telegrams received by each branch office are streamlined to be reasonable, and the job assignments of staff are adjusted from time to time.

(3) Compiling Work Instructions for Each Branch Office According to the actual needs of each business office and the complexity of the business, they are compiled separately and instructed to comply.

(4) Supplementing Training for Salespersons Lectures are compiled and printed on applied knowledge in business for spare-time study.

(5) Holding Review Meetings Regularly Responsible persons from each business unit are summoned regularly to review gains and losses for improvement.

(6) Establishing Branch Business Offices and Agencies Since September of last year, a total of ten units have been added, including the South Zhongshan Road, City Center, and East Zhongshan Road branch offices, the South Xizang Road telegraph kiosk, the Pacific Travel Agency, the first and second wharf reception centers of the China Merchants Bureau, and the Zhoupu, Beicai, and Zhangjiangzha telegraph and telephone agencies.

(7) Public Service Desks are Set Up in Demonstration Business Offices Including the general business office, Changzhi Road, and South Zhongshan Road. Excellent salespersons are selected to handle oral inquiries and draft telegrams for various services.

(8) Conduct Cleanliness, Humility, Telegraph Accuracy, and Telephone Saving Campaigns Various campaigns are held periodically and continue to be promoted.

(9) Extending Business Hours of Business Offices In response to public demand, the business hours of the North Station Branch, the Confucian Temple Telegraph Kiosk, and the South Xizang Road Telegraph Kiosk are extended.

(10) About Telegraph Inquiries, Selling Valuable Outgoing Telegraph Paper, and Increasing the Acceptance of Timed Express Telegrams Business Offices To handle telegraph error inquiries, eleven units including Yuyuan Road and East Zhongshan Road are designated. To sell valuable outgoing telegram paper, ten units including the general business office are designated. The North Station Branch is also designated to handle express telegraph services.

(11) Using Six-Digit Registration Numbers

With the surge in telegraph traffic, four-digit registration numbers have long been insufficient, often causing those who register for telegraph numbers to be disappointed. After detailed research and planning, our bureau has adopted six-digit registration numbers, from 500001 to 599999. The first two digits are used to identify zonal delivery (from 50-59), which is quite convenient for delivering telegrams, and the registration numbers available to users are fully supplied.

D. Conclusion

Telecommunications is a public service, and telecommunications operations should strive for speed and thoroughness. In the past year, due to environmental, human, and material limitations, we are still far from the expected goals. Moreover, public needs are constantly evolving, and telecommunications traffic is the national nervous system. All places and bureaus are connected, and their breath is related. A single mistake affects the whole country. Therefore, how to enable Shanghai telecommunications to meet the needs of the public is an urgent task. We hope that domestic sages and telecommunications pioneers will continue to cooperate and give guidance so that the development of the telecommunications industry can truly rely on it.

### Formal Election of Directors and Supervisors of the Chinese Telecommunications Society

The directors and supervisors of the Chinese Telecommunications Society were solemnly elected on the 10th of this month under the supervision of the instructor of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The elected directors were: Tao Fengshan, Qian Qishen, Zhu Yicheng, Nie Chuanru, Chen Shuren, Yu Bingjian, Fei Liquan, Gu Jiayou, Jin Baoguang, Huang Ruzu, Ji Shunting, Zhang Xiang, Li Wan, Ma Cailiang, Wang Zhengwei, Zhang Zumo, Lu Zongcheng, Zou Maotong, Zhou Pengfei, Deng Wangcheng, and Sheng Zhenyi, totaling twenty-one people.

### Shanghai Exchange Firms Declare Foreign Exchange Assets; Transfer to National Bank Begins Yesterday; Deadline for Registering Foreign Exchange Assets Abroad is End of This Month

[Reported by this newspaper] Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to guide the transfer of foreign exchange assets of exchange firms. He returned to Beijing by night train yesterday after completing his official duties. According to Vice Minister Xu:

(1) Compiling and tabulating the declared assets of commercial exchange firms, trust companies, and insurance companies takes time, and the total amount has not yet been finalized. Those who falsely declare figures will be severely punished once verified. The investigation will be carried out by the Gold Control Bureau. The transfer of foreign exchange assets of exchange firms, trust companies, and insurance companies will begin today (the 13th), and the deadline is yet to be determined.

(2) The declaration and registration of foreign exchange assets of factories and companies will be handled by the declaration and registration guidance committee established by the municipal government in accordance with the "Measures for the Registration of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by the People of the Republic of China." In addition to maintaining contact with the committee, I hope that this matter can be accelerated. State-owned enterprises will handle it in advance.

(3) The issue of the redemption and ratio of pounds and rupees is still being studied by the Central Bank and has not yet reached a conclusion.

(4) The date for the resumption of the securities exchange has not yet been decided by the Executive Yuan.

(5) The Ministry of Finance has announced that the deadline for the redemption of gold, silver, and foreign currency will not be extended.

Also reported: According to Article 1 of the Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by the People of the Republic of China, foreign exchange assets are designated as one type of national general mobilization material. Therefore, it is necessary for all domestic money and banking industries to declare and register their foreign exchange assets in advance. It is learned that the Executive Yuan recently stipulated that all foreign exchange assets deposited abroad by domestic money and banking industries must be declared and registered before September 30 of this year. Those who fail to declare or falsely declare will be deemed to have violated the economic control laws and regulations and will have their business licenses revoked or suspended. Those who violate Article 8 of the same measures, intending to avoid declaration and registration from August 20 of this year, and transfer their foreign exchange assets to foreign natural persons, legal persons, or other social groups will, once discovered, be punished in accordance with Article 11, paragraph 1 of the same measures and Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Penalties for Obstructing National General Mobilization Law.

### China Textile Yesterday Resumed Rationing; Yarn Prices Mostly Fell to the Limit; Cotton Cloth Market Still Sluggish

Yesterday, cotton yarn trading returned to normal, and trading in the market was relatively smooth. Shenxin Yarn Factory continued to open 204 pieces. Yongan and other private yarn factories also opened sales one after another. Moreover, the Textile Construction Company allocated daily, and the practical manufacturers in the market were eager to purchase. Because the supply was abundant, most of the opening prices had fallen to the limit. 10-count coarse yarn fell by about 5 yuan to 20 yuan to the limit, and 20-count also fell by 5, 6, and 7 yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns were generally weak. A total of 489 pieces were traded throughout the day.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued to decline in the face of oversupply. The "Danbang" (single carrier) from other places was only allowed to carry one bolt of cloth per person. Most local hoarders, fearing secret reports, sold a lot. Cloth shops also frequently sold. There were not many people in the industry and dyeing factories entering and leaving the market. The high-quality market remained sluggish and lifeless.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially fell by 2 jiao at the opening, slightly improved by 1 jiao due to real sales in the middle of the street, and finally retreated to 26.5 yuan, falling another 5 jiao compared to last Saturday. The dealers and Banghao sought low-end sub-brand fine cloth to meet the market. B-character Dragon Head, Five Blessings, Yanghe, and Trumpet Boy traded a lot, so the market only fell by 2 jiao. Four Gentlemen Yuan Beji suffered less with fewer hoarded goods and the season being on its way out.

China Textile Sells Yarn

[Reported by this newspaper] China Textile Construction Company resumed selling yarn yesterday, opening three types of 20-count yarn in the market, with 157 pieces approved for purchase, totaling 110,999 yuan in price. The prices of the three types opened, Double Carp, Pentium, and Lotus Heart, were all 707 yuan.

Also, the company listed a total of ten types of yarn, with 1,073 purchase orders approved, a total of 1,548 pieces approved for purchase, totaling 3,055 pieces of 20-count yarn, totaling 1,347,328 yuan in price.

The selling prices of each count of yarn were: 20-count Double Carp 707 yuan, 6-count Sub-Sunlight 255 yuan, 10-count Lima Sub-Blue Phoenix 480 yuan, 10-count Double Strand Harvest 528 yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach 787 yuan, 32-count Double Strand Harvest 880 yuan, 40-count Fairy Peach 880 yuan, 42-count Double Strand Blue Phoenix 1050 yuan, 60-count Sunlight 1150 yuan, and 60-count Double Strand Sunlight (Singed) 1280 yuan.

### China Merchants Bureau Formal Shares Can Be Exchanged Starting on the 15th

According to the State-Run China Merchants Bureau: All of the shares issued by the bureau can be printed by the 14th. Starting on the 15th, those who hold temporary receipts for share payments can exchange them for formal shares at the selling bank. Also, yesterday, five units of state-run enterprise shares sold for a total of 486,000 yuan.

### Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Redemption Statistics

### China Trust Bureau Scheduled to Auction Large Quantities of Woolen Fabrics Today

Artificial Silk Goods to be Distributed Tomorrow

The Central Trust Bureau's Committee for the Sale of Government Materials sold 426 boxes of rayon, auctioned daily necessities, groceries, and cotton cloth last week, totaling 580,000 yuan in price. Today (14th), a large quantity of woolen fabrics will be auctioned.

Also reported: It is said that the woolen fabrics currently controlled by the China Trust Bureau include striped grass green beji, yuan zhuang beji, plain Xiawei, assorted color beji, striped Xiawei, plaid tweed, 456 Xiawei, downy woolen, checkered linen, palis, and fanliding. Some of these will be auctioned this week.

Also reported: Because it is difficult to replenish woolens and the amount allocated by China Textile has decreased, applicants are extremely crowded, and the selling prices inside and outside the market are quite different. Most general woolen fabric stores can only deal with door-to-door sales, and wholesale is mostly temporarily suspended.

Also reported: The 83rd distribution of rayon to the silk weaving industry and the 67th distribution of rayon to the ribbon weaving industry by the China Trust Bureau are scheduled to begin this Wednesday (15th). However, the distribution price has not been reviewed by the Shanghai Regional Materials Adjustment Committee and is said to be distributed at the original price.

### Reading "On Vanity"

— Bai Yong

Some time ago, I read Mr. Wu's "On Vanity" and had many thoughts. I can roughly define it as:

"Political morality is perhaps immoral." Perhaps this statement is too inflammatory, especially when spoken by someone like us who doesn't understand the so-called "political science." It may cause experts to scoff, but this is what my heart feels at peace with, and cannot tolerate "vanity." Originally, morality has no fixed standard. After pondering, I feel like it is always seeking greater benefits, just like Mencius said, "There are things more desirable than life, and things more hateful than death." The ultimate goal of morality is probably to seek that "more than" thing. "More than" exists when individuals are the object, and it is not lacking when the masses are the object. It would be ideal if one could consider both the individual and the whole, otherwise sacrificing oneself to save the group is saintly, refusing to benefit the world by plucking out a single hair is fulfilling one's duty, and harming others to benefit oneself is petty. However, when it comes to vying for political power, these standards become somewhat incompatible. Mozi's "Universal Love" chapter once used theft and murder to illustrate the unreasonableness of war, but the world is inherently like this. To put it nicely, killing a few people can save the majority.

This is not a theoretical but a factual issue. The concept of "the winner is king, the loser is bandit" has been accumulated for thousands of years, but Emperor Gaozu of Han remains in the position of emperor. Except for Sima Qian, who likes to complain, no one dares to include Xiang Yu in the main chronicles, let alone the Yellow Turbans and Red Eyebrows. If benevolence and righteousness exist among the lords, then one must bow to reality. No one is willing to bow to reality, but no one can do anything about it. This is how the Twenty-Four Histories were written. Otherwise, our history would be impossible to tell.

Mencius is really interesting, on the one hand, he brags and expands, "Who can unify it!" "One who does not delight in killing can unify it!" On the other hand, he emphasizes Tang and Wu's punitive expeditions. Isn't punitive expedition killing? "I have heard of the execution of one man, Zhou, but have not heard of killing a ruler," but the "Wu Cheng" chapter of the Book of Documents clearly says, "They turned their spears around, and the blood flowed enough to float pestles." Although some say this is an exaggeration, it is true that many people were killed. So, isn't Mencius telling lies! If I were King Hui of Liang or King Xuan of Qi, I wouldn't welcome his pedantic theories either. It is probably from this tradition that later generations of Confucian scholars have become impractical and empty-headed.

Therefore, scholars who are full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality can never be emperors. Some people even scold this kind of "warm-hearted benevolence" as "woman's benevolence." But what is the essential difference between woman's benevolence and great man's benevolence? Women love kittens and puppies, does that mean men advocate killing all cats and dogs? If a woman is deceived by a villain (mostly a man), does that mean the woman deserves to die? All that originates from "love" should, in theory, be without near and far, without difference, without friend or foe. That is God's intention. Why is woman's benevolence undesirable? It's just to say that if you want to play with the world in the palm of your hand, then woman's benevolence is not allowed. However, a white-faced scholar with no strength to fight chickens, from his youth in school, hums and babbles about benevolence and righteousness, and even laments the death of a stink bug. How can he talk about burning books, burying scholars alive, and killing people like grass without a sound? Needless to say, if they want to compete for political power, they will inevitably fail (they don't think about these things at all, they would be content with being a peaceful official). Even if they inherit the foundation of their fathers and brothers, I am afraid it will be difficult to ensure that they "enjoy a long life." The cases of Emperor Jianwen being expelled by the Prince of Yan and Li Chongguang dying from a traction-machine drug are both extremely tragic examples. Emperor Gaozu of Han using a doctoral hat as a chamber pot is truly great, from the standpoint of political morality, this is an absolute necessity. And his later killing of Han Xin, and pickling Peng Yue, and Zhu Yuanzhang's killing of Li Shanchang, and handling of Hu Weiyong, are all things that scholars would never do and would curse endlessly. They do not know that this is precisely why Gao of Han is Gao of Han, and why the Ming Ancestor is the Ming Ancestor.

If you cannot see through this mystery, and cannot jump out of this circle, it is better to have less ambition, so as to avoid a great tragedy. Lao Tzu's words are absolutely correct, "The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao." If political morality can be spoken, it is probably not that which can be spoken, the reason why it can be "constant," is precisely because it is "unusual," how wonderful!

### "Burning Plate"

— Liu

The Beijing dialect refers to the blushing of people due to shame as "burning the plate." It is said that "plate" is the face, and "burning" means red.

However, in novels, the description of shame often includes sayings such as "the face is so red with shame that it reaches the neck." According to travelers, among relatively primitive tribes that often practice nudity, shame often starts from the face and goes down to the waist. But many painters' reports go even further. They say that when they draw nudes, the models sometimes blush from head to toe due to shyness, which in Beijing dialect can be described as "burning" the whole body.

### Random Notes on Film Adaptation of Peking Opera

— He Shi Xi

Mr. Mei Lanfang, at the invitation of director Fei Mu, is producing a color film, intending to market it abroad. I hear that the scene of "Farewell My Concubine" with the sword dance has already been filmed, and only a small part of the play "Life and Death Hate" has been completed. The plot is still being considered for additions and subtractions, which I believe is a matter worthy of discussion. I have a few opinions to share openly with those who love Mei.

(1) The story of "Life and Death Hate" comes from Tao Zongyi's "輟耕錄" of the Yuan Dynasty. This time, a good edition of this book should be found, and the record of this episode should be shown before the film as a "premise," so that people know that this play has a famous work as its basis, and is not a baseless fabrication.

(2) It is appropriate to design the most ideal Chinese stage architecture, such as a dome-shaped stage ceiling, a grand stage surface, and all kinds of exquisitely embroidered table drapes, large curtains, and stage curtains, all of which can be given close-up shots. The Peking Opera orchestra (commonly known as "Wen Wu Chang Mian") should be given a clear presentation so that foreigners or Chinese people who are not familiar with Peking Opera can learn about the organization of Peking Opera instruments.

(3) At the beginning of the story, the first character to appear on stage must step out from the entrance (and the large curtain door will be removed afterward). The last character to leave the stage in the final scene must be made to enter the stage from the reappearing curtain door, and then the curtain closes, so as to clearly show that this is a stage play. (Editor's note: Points (2) and (3) are quite similar to Sir Laurence Olivier's masterpiece "Henry V.")

(4) Regarding the expressions of the actors, I heard someone suggest that Han Yu Niang has many scenes of weeping and must learn the stage play's way of looking up to the sky and shouting, and follow the film's way of tears streaming down her face, in order to meet the conditions of realism. Shi Xi does not think so. The highest artistic realm of all fine arts lies in reaching the traceless from the traceable, and transcending the imageless from the imageful, which is considered precious. The advantage of Peking Opera is that it can use abstract and freehand ways to perform the facts, so that the viewers can understand it intuitively and have an inexhaustible aftertaste. Those who have a little dramatic knowledge, both Chinese and foreigners, can generally understand this. (Qi Rushan's "Mei Lanfang's Tour of America" contains a very detailed account.) If it is not so, and everything is shown with realistic depiction, then everything is exhausted, becomes shallow, and is no longer art. Therefore, what I hope from Mr. Mei is that the expressions should follow the old stage practices, without any need for change. I discussed this with Professor Chen Meng'an yesterday, and he also strongly supported this idea.

(5) Regarding props (commonly known as "Qie Mo"), I think it is acceptable to follow the original Peking Opera objects and refine them. Still use horse whips and hair tossing, etc., without the need to set up doors and windows. Otherwise, the art of each character cannot be expressed. (For example, when Mr. Jiang Miaoxiang escapes from the Jin Dynasty, he has the superb skill of tossing his hair. Mr. Mei Lanfang's opening and closing of doors and windows have extremely beautiful hand gestures to show.) It also does not conform to the noble principle of freehand brushwork in Peking Opera. If everything must be realistic, then it is no different from a "Lianhe Benxi" (a series of plays), and the knowledgeable people of the country will despise it.

(6) In terms of plot, "Life and Death Hate" is already a famous play that has been repeatedly tempered, so there is no objection. However, the seizure and forced marriage of Cheng Pengju and Han Yu Niang, although both are explained in the opening lines of Cheng Pengju and Zhang Dahao, are still criticized for being implicit rather than explicit. I heard that Fei Mu is re-editing several scenes and adding them to the front, depicting Zhang Dahao's treatment of prisoners like dogs and sheep, and Cheng Pengju's concern for his great ambitions and unwillingness to marry into the Jin Dynasty. This is indeed what I wanted. I once told the Ping Opera critic Su Shaoqing about this, and he also praised it greatly.

(7) Mr. Mei is fifty-five years old this year. If his lifelong hard work and refined skills can be preserved forever through the power of film, and become a model for future generations, this is indeed a great thing. However, everyone has their limitations, and Mr. Mei has no decades of experience in film. If he abandons his inherent superb skills in Peking Opera and forcibly incorporates them into the rules of film, it would be like using Chu talents in Jin, or cutting feet to fit shoes. In my spare time from seeing patients, I am fascinated by Peking Opera, and I am writing to protect Peking Opera because I firmly believe that this is not possible. If the script of "Life and Death Hate" is suitable for the film genre, then are there no people in the film industry who are qualified for this role? Why must Mr. Mei be used as an experiment? For the sake of Mr. Mei's reputation, I also hope that all the contemporary lovers of Mei will carefully reconsider and handle this matter well.

### Notes on Li Genda

— Wu Zong Can

In a previous article in this publication, "Mr. Yiyun's 清代試塲話弊" (Talks on the Malpractices of the Imperial Examination Market in the Qing Dynasty), it was mentioned that a certain top scholar (狀元) had not finished writing his palace examination paper when it became dark. A certain minister ordered someone to light a paper candle so that he could complete the paper. The so-called "certain top scholar" is Li Pan (Genda) from my hometown, Xuzhou. Pan passed the Kangxi Gengwu year provincial examination (舉人) and became the top scholar of the Dingchou year palace examination, and was appointed as a compiler (修撰) in the Hanlin Academy. On the day of the palace examination, he brought cakes with him. Pan was tall and dark-faced, and his writing ability was usually slow. It was almost noon, but he had not yet finished his paper. According to the rules, the papers were to be collected, but Pan pleaded, "My entire life's success depends on this examination." A certain minister took pity on him and lit a paper candle for him. Pan took out the cakes he had brought and ate them while writing, finally finishing the paper and leaving. The Holy Ancestor (Emperor Kangxi) vaguely heard about this and said, "He is also a hard-working scholar." When the paper was presented, he was promoted to first place. People at the time called him the "Cake-Bearing Top Scholar." Jiang Chenying from Cixi also became a Jinshi (進士) of the first class, third place in the same examination. In the early Qing Dynasty, following the Ming system, the chief examiner (正主考) of the Shunzhi Heavenly Examination was the top scholar of the previous examination. Pan, according to the rules, presided over the Kangxi Jimao year Shunzhi Heavenly Examination, with Chenying as his deputy. After the list was announced, the censor Lu You accused them of unfair examination practices. After investigation, Pan was exiled, and Chenying was implicated and imprisoned. He was not given a verdict and died in prison. Chenying was a famous old scholar in Jiangnan, and he was over seventy years old when he died. People at the time mourned him and said, "Old Ginger is not necessarily truly spicy, Little Li has a great sweetness." After Pan died, he was buried in Black Stone Gorge south of Xuzhou City. Today, in front of the Xima Pool, there is a mansion of the top scholar, and the plaque on the door still exists. The descendants of the Li family live in it, but they are in decline.

### Ice Cream

— Mao Yi

In 1809, the black female cook of the wife of the fourth U.S. President Madison, Sadie J. Hoesen, was actually accused of intending to poison Mrs. Madison's guests by inventing ice cream and was arrested and imprisoned.

Once, a banquet was suddenly canceled, and Sadie put some cream cakes in the refrigerator to cool and store. Two days later, another banquet was held, and she brought out the cakes from the refrigerator to serve the guests, not knowing that they had already frozen.

A nervous guest took a bite and shouted, "Poison!" He hurriedly spat out the ice cake and demanded the arrest of the cook. As a result, Sadie was immediately wrongfully imprisoned. The other guests saw this and scattered like frightened birds and beasts. Afterwards, Mrs. Madison decided to carefully test the cake herself to see if it was poisonous. She tasted it mouthful after mouthful and greatly praised the taste of this frozen cake. So she used her power to bail Sadie out.

The next day, Sadie quickly froze the cake in the kitchen, and her salary was increased by five dollars a month. After this original ice cream was introduced and recommended by Mrs. Madison, every embassy in Washington served ice cream at banquets before the end of the year.

However, the true origin of ice cream is much earlier. When Marco Polo returned to Europe from the East six hundred years ago, he brought back a recipe for making "ice water," which had been used in Asia for thousands of years.

Even today, some countries still make ice cream in a way similar to that of the Roman tyrant Nero. Nero sent groups of slaves to the mountains to fetch ice and snow to chill his delicacies and wines. In modern Romania, "ice men" still collect ice blocks in winter and store them in pits covered with branches, which they take out and use in summer.

In Mexico City, natural ice overwhelms manufactured ice. The ice comes from the local Popocatepetl Mountain. At the 15,000-foot peak, snow and ice accumulate year-round. Local people lay pipes on the mountain. Whenever the sun is strongest, the snow and ice melt and flow down the pipes into containers at the foot of the mountain.

When sunset comes and the temperature drops, the snow water in the containers freezes again. The next time the sun comes out, people expose the containers to the sun slightly to loosen the ice blocks, then pour them out and transport them to ice shops, which sell this natural ice to ice cream shops throughout the city.

### Non-Contention

— Gongsun Wu

The "Confucian Conduct" praises Confucian scholars for "not contending for advantages in easy or dangerous paths, and not contending for harmony between yin and yang in winter and summer." Contending for one's own benefit will inevitably disadvantage others. If everyone seeks their own benefit, there will be endless contention. Those with virtue can refrain from greed when facing wealth, and think of righteousness when seeing profit. Even sages sometimes cannot avoid contending for small advantages out of selfishness. Confucius cited these two matters to illustrate Confucian conduct, saying that a heart that does not tolerate falsehood, and does not lose its adherence even in small actions, is a true Confucian. Reflect on oneself and observe others, and pay attention to these aspects, and one will not go astray. Some say that Confucius's teachings can only work if the whole world becomes gentlemen, otherwise, only make sure that the world has benefits and no harm, and contention will naturally cease. But this is impossible. Today, the theory of the struggle for survival has penetrated deeply into people's hearts. Talk of struggle and contention is constantly heard. Those who adhere to the doctrine of struggle, if they do not contend for advantages in easy or dangerous paths, or for harmony between yin and yang, where do they place themselves? Those who speak of order wish to stop war and prevent chaos. Those who maintain order may abide by it for a while, but if there is any injustice, contention will arise again. Confucius's teachings are increasingly attacked by people today. Where there is life, there is contention. Why does even a great sage not know this? The worries of the one who made the Book of Changes lie in 生生 (continuous generation). If 生生 does not cease, contention will also be endless. Even if there is a state of Xiaokang (moderate prosperity), it is difficult to achieve Taiping (great peace). This principle is easy to understand, and Confucius clearly stated it. If there is a way to not contend, to make people cherish their lives, people will surely be happy to follow it. Recently, there have been many discussions about Confucianism. Humanity is suffering from contention. I wonder if there are any scholars who are exploring the root of the problem.

### Near Poems of Xia An

— Ye Gongchuo

Mr. Mo Zhongliang has served in the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway for forty years. This year, he is over sixty, but he is still as sharp and strong as before. I wrote two poems for the statue to commemorate his past achievements, and it is not without a sense of the past and present:

Starting out at a young age, I have worked hard for forty years; relying on the masters for guidance, I have made a compilation for the rail.

The turtledove perches on a branch, the old steed aspires to travel thousands of miles; do not compose a song of old age, for your merits are worthy of being recorded in history.

Sharing the same illness, we are still restricted for a day at a time, bearing to discuss the fleeting years with mushrooms and trees. Returning home, I dream of the three paths overgrown, how much is 断 楮文 (broken paper writings) worth today! I still remember the past talks turning into illusions, is it possible to obtain new compilations? Mending bones and reviving the disabled are all leisurely matters, but I am still happy to use virtue to make everything whole.

### Merchants Do Not Understand Morality

Editor: Chen Baochang Store, located at Fuzhou Road and Shandong Road West, specializes in selling canned foods. Yesterday, I and five classmates bought ice cream powder from the store for four yuan each. When we opened it back, five out of six cans were spoiled and moldy. We went to return it, but they insisted that it was impossible, and we wasted twenty yuan for nothing. This old store has no business ethics at all. It's really hateful. Your newspaper has always upheld justice, so please publish this to warn others.
