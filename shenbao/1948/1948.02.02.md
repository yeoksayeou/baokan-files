### US-China Negotiations Becoming More Concrete: Aid Loan to China to be Decided by Month's End, Remaining Supplies to be Transferred According to Contract

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] US aid loans to China are gradually becoming more concrete. According to reliable sources, a concrete outcome for this loan is expected before the 20th of this month. This is a major achievement after several days of discussions between Ambassador Stuart and Advisor Chuan Jingwu with Chairman Chiang and Premier Zhang Qun. The main reason is that after Zhang Qun proposed an economic plan, he demonstrated that China already has a strategy for self-reliance. Additionally, Mr. Bei Yizhi's negotiations in the United States have also been quite successful. US aid is now an inevitable trend. However, this loan is not a new allocation of US aid to China, but rather a portion of the Marshall Aid to China plan. The amount may not be less than what outsiders speculate.

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] Hamilton, a New York Times reporter covering the United Nations, interviewed our representative Jiang Tingfu today. According to reports, Mr. Jiang stated that he believes that if China can obtain US$500 million in foreign aid annually for the next three to four years, the Chinese government will definitely be able to establish peace and economic order. Mr. Jiang did not indicate that China would propose this aid plan to the United States but emphasized that the problems caused by internal strife and inflation are interrelated. Mr. Jiang also discussed the issues of Japan and Korea. Regarding the latter, Mr. Jiang believes that although the Soviet Union refused the UN delegation to Korea to enter North Korea, the delegation should still strive to hold elections in South Korea and establish a provisional government.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st, United Press] A report sent to Congress by the US Foreign Liquidation Commission stated that the main task currently in handling US surplus materials in the Far East is to transfer the materials that should be provided to China and the Philippines according to the US-China and US-Philippines wholesale contracts. The cooperation and working conditions of the Chinese, American, and Philippine representatives are currently excellent, and the various plans formulated are being advanced in an orderly manner. Japan and Korea can continue to select and purchase various materials from the US upcoming list of publicly auctioned items and surplus materials. The report also stated that China often has difficulties in receiving US ships at Subic Bay. This work may not be completed until 1949. If the US Navy Department cannot provide the assistance China needs, or if China's original plans change, the United States will take measures to cancel the contract with China, transport the ships back to the United States, and hand over the sale of these ships to the Congressional Liquidation Commission for handling. As of December 31, 1947, the original value of surplus materials sold by the United States in the Pacific China area was US$4,082,700,000, of which 76% (approximately US$3,512,000,000) had already been sold. The report also stated that the United States earned US$632 million from the sale of surplus materials in the Pacific and China areas, approximately 18% of the original value.

### Draft of Provincial and County Autonomy Under Review by National Government Subcommittee; Yu Jiaju Advocates Partial Implementation First

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] The implementation of provincial and county autonomy after the implementation of the Constitution has attracted considerable attention from the general public. Some people previously believed that, according to the provisions of the Constitution, the popular election of provincial and county governors should be launched immediately. However, given that some areas are amidst prolonged warfare, it is practically impossible to universally launch popular elections for provincial and county governors. Furthermore, according to the provisions of Chapter 2 of the draft Provincial and County Autonomy General Rules regarding implementation procedures, counties implementing county autonomy should meet the following conditions:

- The security and defense are well managed.
- The finances are well organized.
- Household registration is completed.
- Land registration is completed.

Provincial autonomy can only be implemented after more than half of the counties within a province have completed autonomy. Regarding this issue, the reporter inquired with Government Commissioner Yu Jiaju. Mr. Yu believes that if these regulations are fully adhered to, the implementation of provincial and county autonomy will be delayed for a very long time. Therefore, this point seems to be worthy of considering amendments. Mr. Yu's opinion is that it may be considered to temporarily not implement provincial and county autonomy in the following circumstances:

- Areas in wartime.
- Fortress areas.
- Economically depressed areas.
- Provinces and counties with sparse populations.

The above points are all based on facts. However, this draft is currently still under review and discussion by the National Government Committee subcommittee, and there is no conclusion yet. Regarding Premier Zhang Qun's statement that the implementation of provincial and county autonomy should be after the downsizing of provinces, Mr. Yu said that many people's concerns about downsizing provinces are based on the past evils of warlord separatism and the difficulty of organizing the people's power to resist the enemy in combat. In fact, downsizing provinces is an academic opinion, and if it is immediately implemented, there will inevitably be some difficulties in practice, and the aforementioned concerns are unlikely to reappear now. Mr. Yu believes that some large provinces can be slightly divided, but full implementation may not be necessary. Mr. Yu also believes that today, after the implementation of the Constitution, since provincial and county autonomy cannot be implemented immediately, a transitional method can be used to replace it. How the form of provincial and county governments should be stipulated in this transitional method remains to be studied.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Capital Garrison, Sun Lianzhong, officially took office at the headquarters on the morning of the 1st. The handover ceremony began at 10:00 AM, personally presided over by the former concurrent Commander Zhang Zhen. More than 500 officers from the Garrison Headquarters participated. The Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, and the Chief of Police, Huang Zhenwu, also attended the ceremony. At the beginning of the ceremony, Zhang Zhen gave a brief introductory speech, stating that General Sun Lianzhong is a famous general, and now that he is taking office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Capital Garrison, he believes that he will definitely be able to further strengthen the capital garrison work in the future. Mr. Zhang also traced the security situation in the capital since he took office, saying that several unfortunate incidents had occurred in Shanghai, but fortunately, no similar incidents had occurred in Nanjing. He expressed his gratitude to the officers of the headquarters for their assistance during his tenure. Subsequently, Sun Lianzhong gave a speech to his officers, putting forward three points:

- The responsibilities of the Garrison Headquarters are quite extensive. He hopes to ensure that everyone in the jurisdiction can live and work in peace.
- Regarding personnel matters, he will not make changes lightly.
- Everyone must be responsible at each level to achieve perfection.

Mr. Sun also stated that he has now taken on the capital garrison work and will work hard based on the Chairman's instructions and the foundation laid by Commander Zhang in the past. At 10:20 AM, after the speech was over, Zhang Zhen accompanied him to the Commander's office to take charge of affairs. At 10:30 AM, Zhang Zhen shook hands with Mr. Sun and bid farewell. Mr. Sun personally escorted him to the outside of the Commander's office, and Mr. Zhang got into the car and left.

### Establishment of Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the Border Area of Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi Provinces; Guangdong Construction Department Re-plans the Province's Highway Main Lines

[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 1st] It is learned that the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the border area of Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi Provinces will be established on the 1st. The headquarters will be located in Nanxiong County, Guangdong. Ye is appointed as the Commander-in-Chief, with Song Zhongying and Guo Siyuan as deputies.

### National Economic Commission Discusses and Approves in Principle: Our Government Has Not Yet Made a Decision on Tariff Reductions in Various Countries

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] The National Economic Commission discussed the method of adopting an import-export linked system for international trade on January 30th and approved it in principle. However, the government is still studying and considering it. Although this method can compete for foreign exchange, its implementation will inevitably have both advantages and disadvantages. It is learned that the relevant authorities are considering this matter in approximately two aspects: Regarding its advantages:

- When the official exchange rate is too far from the black market rate, exports are obstructed. At the same time, the government has to reduce import quotas due to the reduction of foreign exchange sources, which will inevitably fail to meet the legitimate needs of the domestic production sector. The adoption of this system can invigorate import and export trade.
- The linked system subsidizes exporters with a portion of the profits earned by importers, without the need to increase the burden on the national treasury.

Regarding its disadvantages, there are also several points:

- Currently, China's export value is far less than its import value. After adopting this system, exports can be expected to increase, but the increased amount will still be used for imports. Therefore, imports will also inevitably increase proportionally. Importers will compete to purchase linked foreign exchange from exporters. In the case of supply falling short of demand, the black market foreign exchange will be stimulated.
- Since the import value is much greater than the export value, the government's abandonment of all export exchange settlement income is still not enough to balance imports and exports. It only reduces the government's foreign exchange sources and still has to bear most of the foreign exchange required for imports.
- There are two types of linked systems: individual and comprehensive. Individual linking is suitable for industrialized countries, where manufacturers import raw materials and export finished products, which is difficult for China to imitate due to its backward industry. As for the comprehensive linked system, although it can export bristles and silk in exchange for machinery, etc., it is bound to allow them to be resold because they are not needed for export. Linked foreign exchange will cause speculation and arbitrage.
- The foundation of China's exporters has always been weak, and most of them still have to go through the hands of foreign merchants. After import-export linking, exporters may not be able to obtain real benefits and only create opportunities for foreign merchants to profit. Therefore, the government is unlikely to adopt this system in the short term.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] Zhang Tianze, Director of the International Trade Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who went to Geneva to attend the second preparatory meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment and the tariff reduction consultation meeting, returned to the country and arrived in Beijing a few days ago. According to his statement to reporters, the result of the Geneva meeting on tariff reduction was the agreement on the Geneva Agreement tariff rates. Representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries attending the meeting have submitted applications to their respective governments for approval and have been implemented since January of this year. China has not yet approved it. According to the Geneva Agreement tariff rates, the tariffs of various countries will be generally reduced compared to before. Taking carpets as an example, the old tax was 60% per square foot, while the new tax is only 40%. However, China is a backward industrial country and advocates maintaining protective tariffs. Therefore, it is not yet known whether this new agreement tariff rate will be implemented. In addition, the issue of foreign exchange control was also discussed for a long time at the meeting. Some countries advocated that countries should open up foreign exchange and not impose controls. However, countries that have suffered the pain of war advocated controlling foreign exchange. The United States strongly advocated opening up foreign exchange and proposed that countries should control foreign exchange until 1950. It was not passed at the meeting, but it was decided that after a certain time limit, countries could negotiate and relax foreign exchange control measures.

### Report on the Investigation of the North China Petition Delegation; Three Control Yuan Members Returned to Beijing After Completion; Huo Baoshu Asks to Increase Official Foreign Exchange Rates

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] Control Yuan members Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, and Li Xiaoting, who went to Shanghai to investigate the report submitted by the North China Petition Delegation, have completed their tasks. Yu Shude returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the evening of the 1st. After the two Control Yuan members Miao and Li return to Beijing on the 2nd, the three will draft a report based on the results of the investigations in Beijing and Shanghai. It is learned that Yu and others visited Zhang Jiaao and Huo Baoshu in Shanghai. According to Zhang Jiaao's statement to the three Control Yuan members, the control of Shanghai foreign exchange has now been relaxed. In the past, the foreign exchange rate for Shanghai foreign exchange was too high, reaching as high as 25% at its peak. Now it is only about 10%. For the purchase of flour in Shanghai by the Pingjin Municipal Government, the Central Bank can adopt a foreign exchange mortgage method. It only needs to pay the money to the Central Bank in Pingjin and can be used in Shanghai. Huo Baoshu stated that too much Tianjin export goods are stockpiled and cannot be exported because the difference between the foreign exchange rate and the official price is too large. If the official foreign exchange rate can be increased to gradually approach the black market rate, and merchants can profit from it, export goods can be circulated. Zhang and Huo both expressed their willingness to provide relevant information to the Control Yuan members.

### Our Ambassador to Bolivia Has Submitted His Credentials

### Communist Bandits Implement the Three Checks; Many Cadres Are Killed

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 1st] A senior military officer told reporters: The Communist bandits have decided to intensify the bloody struggle this year. Their "revolutionary budget" this year will cause 150 million people to lose their lives, because the ideal population of China for the Communist bandits is 120 million. Dong Shaocheng, Section Chief of the 12th Military Sub-district of the Communist Bandit Jidong Military Region, surrendered to the National Army on January 24th. According to him, the Communist bandits have two central tasks this year: The first is the party purification and three checks movement, that is, checking the position, checking the ideology, and checking the class origin. The class origin check traces back to the grandparents, parents, and the person themselves. Those from landlord, capitalist, or intellectual class backgrounds are all considered speculators and are killed. Many cadres who have worked for many years have been killed. He has worked for the Communist bandits for six years, and he escaped and surrendered because his life was threatened by the three checks. Along with this cruel policy of the Communist bandits, he brought a large number of documents. The purpose of this terrorist action by the Communist bandits is to eliminate the middle cadres and directly control the ignorant masses in order to consolidate their violence. Another central task this year is land reform, the content of which is nothing more than further destruction of rural stability.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st] The killing of Communist bandit cadres in the Three Checks movement is heard daily. It is learned that Zhang Wenang, the liaison minister of the Communist Bandit Luliang Military Region, was labeled as a class enemy and killed.

In 1939, he rebelled and served as the Deputy Commander of the New Army of the Jin-Sui Border Region and the Chief of the Military Law Department of the Jin-Sui Administrative Office.

### The Pingyu Railway is Restored and Open to Traffic; The Situation in Eastern Hebei Turns Stable; Remnants of the Nie Bandit Flee to the Hebei Border

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] After the National Army swept the area along the Beining Railway between Ping and Yu, the security has become tranquil. The railway, which was damaged on the 29th, has been restored and opened to traffic.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 1st] General Lin Weiyun recently came to Tianjin from eastern Hebei and went to Ping to report on his duties to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. According to him, the situation in eastern Hebei is stable. There are very few bandit tracks south of the Beining Railway, and very few bandit troops north of the railway. The railway has been spared major damage, but minor damage is still inevitable. Most of the damage is done by children driven by the Communist bandits. Nearly 300 people who broke the road in groups of three or five have recently been captured east of Changli. Most of them are ignorant children and have been sent to Ping for education.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] A strong force of the National Army recently attacked the four regiments of the Liu Bingyan Department of the 10th Military Sub-district of the Communist Bandit Jizhong in the Yongqing and Baxian area. The bandits suffered heavy losses and fled to the south bank of the Daqing River. The National Army is pursuing the victory.

### Regulations for the Evaluation of Taxable Goods: Revised and Promulgated by the Ministry of Finance

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The Ministry of Finance has revised the regulations for the evaluation of taxable goods for commodity tax, which were officially promulgated on January 31st and circulated to all provinces and cities to be implemented from February 1st. The provisions of the regulations are as follows:

Article 1 These regulations are enacted in accordance with Article 5 of the Commodity Tax Ordinance, Article 4 of the National Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Ordinance, Article 5 of the Mineral Product Tax Ordinance, and Article 16 of the Provisional Regulations on the Organization of the Commodity Evaluation Committee of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance.

Article 2 The duty-paid price of each type of taxable goods shall be assessed separately by region according to the circumstances within the jurisdiction of the commodity tax sub-bureau.

Article 3 After the duty-paid price is determined, the tax payable shall be calculated according to the statutory tax rate. For the sake of convenience in affixing stamps and other collection techniques, odd fractions may be waived in the calculation of the aforementioned tax amount.

Article 4 The duty-paid price and the tax payable shall be assessed once a month and reviewed comprehensively every three months. All calculations shall be based on the average wholesale price of the market for one month, from the 21st of the previous month to the 20th of the current month, according to the statutory formula and tax rate, and shall be publicly announced and implemented on the 1st of the following month. The months of January, April, July, and October each year are designated as comprehensive review periods. After evaluation by the Evaluation Committee, the results shall be submitted to the Taxation Department for approval by the Ministry of Finance and then issued to the tax authorities in each district for public announcement and implementation. In the eight months of February, March, May, June, August, September, November, and December each year, the tax prices and amounts shall be assessed and reported by each district bureau or directly subordinate bureau to the Taxation Department for record. However, if the tax price and amount are lower than the previous period, the tax shall temporarily continue to be levied according to the tax amount approved for the previous period until approval is received, and then the revised levy shall be publicly announced.

Article 5 When directly subordinate bureaus assess the monthly tax price and amount, they shall consult with designated district bureaus.

Article 6 When assessing the duty-paid price of each type of taxable goods, the following methods shall be used separately: For taxable goods that have been registered with the Taxation Department using a legal trademark, the duty-paid price shall be determined on a brand-by-brand basis in principle. However, under appropriate circumstances, the price may be determined by grade according to value. For goods without trademarks or local products, the actual sales situation in the market shall be carefully considered, and the duty-paid price shall be assessed and classified according to their quality and wholesale price. If the quality and wholesale price of the same type of goods are too disparate and it is necessary to classify them by grade, the number of grades shall not exceed four.

Article 7 The duty-paid price determined according to the price limit or negotiated price of government agencies shall be adjusted immediately by the district bureaus or directly subordinate bureaus if the price limit or negotiated price changes and implemented first, while reporting to the Taxation Department for record.

Article 8 Each district commodity tax bureau shall adopt a key point approach based on the actual distribution of all taxable goods in the district, formulate a survey market for each type of taxable goods, and report it to the Taxation Department for record. The wholesale price of the main taxable goods in that market shall be used as the main basis for assessing the duty-paid price of that type of taxable goods in that district, and the wholesale prices of other secondary producing areas shall be used as reference materials. The aforementioned regulations on survey markets shall be based on proximity to the producing area in principle.

Article 9 If taxable goods have seasonality or other reasons that make it impossible to find continuous market prices for reference, the most recent wholesale price may be used as the basis for calculation. If they are newly manufactured goods without a formal market wholesale price, the ex-factory price may be used temporarily as the duty-paid price. When there is a wholesale price in the market, it shall be adjusted according to the wholesale price. If the price is limited or negotiated by government agencies, the price limit and negotiated price shall be used as the basis for assessing the duty-paid price.

Article 10 If it is difficult to accurately survey the actual wholesale price of various types of taxable goods in the market, the Taxation Department may be requested to assess it separately according to the retail price.

Article 11 Each commodity tax sub-bureau shall designate a special person to be responsible for surveying the market wholesale prices of various types of taxable goods produced within the jurisdiction of the bureau, recording them daily, filling them in the prescribed survey form, and calculating their average wholesale price. They shall be submitted to the Taxation Department and the district bureau in charge every five days. The district bureau shall also designate a special person to be responsible for reviewing and statistically analyzing the price data reported by each sub-bureau, and shall submit it to the Taxation Department every ten days. Each directly subordinate bureau shall report the price to the Taxation Department daily. The various form styles and form filling instructions shall be determined separately by the Taxation Department.

Article 12 When each bureau surveys the market wholesale price of taxable goods, it shall pay attention to the market conditions registered by the industrial and commercial groups in each place and the market prices published in local newspapers. The price survey publications of local public and private institutions shall also be collected for reference. Other relevant government agencies' price limits or negotiated price methods and implementation status shall be reported at any time.

Article 13 If merchants in various industries have objections to the duty-paid price assessed in the comprehensive review or monthly assessment, they may state their reasons, submit supporting documents, and send them to the industry association for submission to the Taxation Department for review by the Evaluation Committee. Merchants who have not formed an association may directly submit the request.

Article 14 If the Evaluation Committee reviews the opinions submitted by the association or merchant and considers them unreasonable, it shall send them to the Taxation Department for clear reply. If it considers them reasonable, it shall hold a meeting for review or solicit opinions and send them to the Taxation Department for approval by the Ministry of Finance for revision.

Article 15 When merchants in various industries submit opinions in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, the tax shall still be paid according to the assessed duty-paid price. If the result of the review changes, the revised levy shall be implemented from the date of approval and public announcement.

Article 16 These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Ministry of Finance.

### On the Reynolds Expedition to China

— Liu Xian

Mr. Milton Reynolds, known as the "Ballpoint Pen King," and his party recently came to China from the United States, passed through Shanghai to Beijing, and declared that they would go to western China for high-altitude exploration with five objectives: to use radar to measure the height of the main peak of Mount 積石 (Amunemaqin in Tibetan); to investigate glaciers; to study topography; to explore the source of the Yellow River; and to take photographs. The budget is estimated at US$155,000, with specially equipped aircraft. Chinese scientists are welcome to participate, and a base will be set up in Chengdu, etc. Here, we would like to express our views in order to urge the relevant scientific authorities in our country to pay attention to exploration and development, survey nature, increase human knowledge, and broaden our horizons. This is the noble purpose of scientific research, and advanced scientific countries in the world are mostly doing this, such as the Soviet Union in the Arctic and the United States in the Antarctic, both of which have actively carried out such explorations, achieving remarkable results and making great contributions. In the past, our country felt the lack of manpower and financial resources, resulting in very little exploration of the high mountains, great rivers, border areas, and hinterland within the country, which was regretted by those in the know. Therefore, whenever foreign scientific groups come to China for exploration, they have never failed to express welcome. Examples in the past include the Asian Expedition organized by the American Museum of Natural History, the Swedish Central Asian Expedition, and the French Haardt-Citroen Trans-Eurasian Motor Expedition to Peiping.

However, the Reynolds expedition to China this time is quite abrupt. Its organization, nature, purpose, itinerary, timing, team members, etc., have not been heard of beforehand. There is no record in Chinese and foreign newspapers either. It is said that they are currently in negotiations with the authorities of the Academia Sinica. Mr. Reynolds only received reporters and made a statement after arriving in Nanjing, explaining the five objectives and introducing three or five team members. It can be seen that there is no thorough preparation. It is important to know that exploration work has a dangerous nature. If it is not planned in detail and prepared properly in advance, it is inevitable that things will go wrong and difficulties will be encountered temporarily. Not only that, but exploration activities are outdoor scientific research, and even more so not an act of seeking fame and fortune by individuals. The goals must be determined in advance, with sufficient preparation and expert planning, in order to ensure success. For example, if high-altitude surveys are to be carried out, there must be experts in meteorology, geography, geology, zoology, botany, and surveying and physics to work together. In terms of work, part of it is aerial surveying and photography, using radar to measure the height of mountain peaks, and part of it is ground exploration to determine the location of high peaks and the direction of nearby mountain ranges, and to draw maps. If glaciers are to be investigated and topography studied, glacier geology experts (Glacial Geologist) and geomorphology experts (Seomorphologist) must participate in the work. Among the Reynolds expedition team members, in addition to pilots, photographers, and mechanics, there are only two or three scientific experts. It can be seen that there is no comprehensive plan or proper arrangement for the scope of work and the selection of team members in advance. Suddenly coming to China for high-altitude exploration, we have a profound feeling of the true purpose of the team.

Furthermore, modern exploration is not comparable to ordinary travel. It involves national defense secrets; this is related to sovereignty and cannot be ignored. At present, few European and American countries allow people from other countries to freely enter the hinterland and conduct exploration work of unclear nature. Mr. Reynolds is the owner of a ballpoint pen company and has not heard of any exploration experience. Leading the team eastward, part of the funding comes from donations from the American Life magazine. It can be seen that the expedition has a strong commercial advertising color, rather than purely scientific exploration. According to international practice, exploration of a non-scientific nature is generally not allowed to enter the country, let alone be sponsored. If there is exploration of a military reconnaissance nature, it must be strictly rejected.

According to a Chicago cable a few days ago, another important mission of the Reynolds expedition is to explore the reserves of uranium (Ura-nium) ore in the major mountain ranges of western China, using secret instruments for systematic exploration and estimating their reserves. Uranium is the main raw material for the manufacture of atomic weapons, and the great powers are making every effort to explore and investigate it. The United States and the Soviet Union have already ordered a ban on exports in order to strengthen national defense. If the rumors are true, then the mission of the Reynolds expedition is indeed not what it seems. It is hoped that our national defense authorities will pay close attention to it!

Also, scientific exploration teams coming to China often have disputes due to non-compliance with agreements or our country's laws. For example, the aforementioned Asian Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, under the leadership of Chapman Andrew, did not comply with the Sino-American cooperation agreement after reaching its destination and clashed with the local government, eventually leading to negotiations. The French Trans-Eurasian Motor Expedition, led by Andri Haardt as the chief leader, adopted a Sino-French cooperation method in our country, led by a certain French military officer, who was domineering and did not respect our country's sovereignty, ignoring the opinions of our country's team members, causing a major dispute. Other examples include the Sino-Swedish Scientific Exploration Team, led by the famous explorer Sven Hedin, which inevitably ended in personal friction and discord. What is even more unbearable is that the Englishman Auriel Stein's archeological work in Xinjiang did not comply with Chinese laws, causing unanimous opposition from our country's academic and cultural circles, and he was eventually expelled by our government. All the examples cited, the distant ones are more than twenty years ago, and the recent ones are more than ten years ago, and those who have experienced them still have fresh memories. Learning from past mistakes, the Reynolds expedition to China this time is the first time that foreigners have come to our country for exploration after the war. Strict regulations should be adopted, and negotiations on participation and cooperation should be based on the principle of mutual benefit and mutual respect. Our country now has outstanding talents in meteorology, geography, geology, zoology, botany, archaeology, and high-altitude surveying, who are capable of high-altitude exploration work. Therefore, we must not be as perfunctory as we were twenty years ago, resulting in being scolded and ridiculed by others, humiliating the national prestige, and violating our original intention of supporting scientific exploration. This is what we hope from the relevant scientific authorities in our country who are negotiating with the Reynolds expedition, to be cautious in handling matters and not to repeat the same mistakes!

### The Ministry of Finance Plans to Formulate Measures for Using Real Estate to Offset Inheritance Tax, to be Implemented After Approval by the Executive Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The Ministry of Finance has already formulated provisional measures for using real estate to offset inheritance tax and will soon submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The contents of the measures are as follows: These measures are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of the revised Inheritance Tax Law (hereinafter referred to as this Law). The ownership of real estate used to offset inheritance tax in accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of this Law shall be transferred to the local government where the aforementioned real estate is located. When local governments accept the real estate prescribed in the preceding article, they shall pay 30% of the tax payable to the collecting agency. The 30% tax payable by the local government in the preceding paragraph may be deducted from the portion of the inheritance tax allocated by the central government to the local government. If the inheritance tax payable by the taxpayer is to be distributed to two or more counties, the local government that accepts the real estate used to offset the tax in full shall pay cash according to the amount to be distributed to that county. The cash to be paid in the preceding paragraph shall be deducted from the 70% of the tax to be allocated by the central government in the current year by the collecting agency according to the amount to be distributed. After local governments accept the real estate used to offset inheritance tax, its use shall be mainly for local education, culture, public welfare, and relief undertakings. The use shall be reported to the competent authorities at each level by the inheritance tax collecting agency for verification. After local governments accept the real estate used to offset inheritance tax, they shall promptly register the ownership of the property and shall not change it without approval. When indivisible or difficult-to-divide real estate is used to offset the tax, if its final appraised price exceeds the tax payable, the portion of the price exceeding the tax shall be paid by the local government that accepts the ownership to the taxpayer for receipt. After the inheritance tax taxpayer completes the procedures for using real estate to offset the tax, the inheritance tax collecting agency shall still issue an inheritance tax payment certificate, but it shall indicate the circumstances of the real estate offset for reference. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Peiping Held a Memorial Service Yesterday for Lu Yinglin and Li Mingding

Chairman Inscribed a Eulogy "Heroic Spirit Lives On" [Our Peiping Dispatch on the 1st] Peiping held a memorial service today for the late Army Commander Lu Yinglin and the late Division Commander Li Mingding, who died in the Laishui battle. More than 200 eulogies and poems were sent from all sides. Chairman Chiang inscribed a eulogy "Heroic Spirit Lives On." Chen Cheng's eulogy read, "The setting sun illuminates the military gate, and the sacrifices and flags will be immortal; the great star sinks in the Ji wilderness, and the drums and trumpets of the generals have remaining grief." Fu Zuoyi's eulogy read, "The country raises soldiers, originally expecting them to serve on the battlefield, not hesitating to die calmly, generously becoming benevolent. The blue blood shows loyalty; ten thousand hardships are only one death. The Jise summons the soul, bearing to mourn the comrades-in-arms for many years, and feeling more pain in relying on the limbs, placing them as confidants. Dan Chen Zhaozu Dou, a thousand autumns of grandeur should be like life." The presiding officer was Xu Huidong, the speaker of the Peiping Municipal Council, and He Siyuan and Ding Shuijin and others were the attendees. The Director of the Executive Headquarters Li Zongren, and the Commander of the Suppression Headquarters Fu Zuoyi both attended and delivered speeches. Chief of Staff Chen Cheng and Commander-in-Chief Wei Lihuang also jointly sent representatives, Geng Youlin, commander of the Fifth Supply District, to attend the memorial service. The venue was decorated solemnly and solemnly. Speaker Xu and Director Li delivered speeches, stating that the deaths of Generals Lu and Li in the Laishui battle had created great achievements, consolidated the outer encirclement of Peiping and Tianjin, and reversed the war situation in North China. Their merits were great. Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi said in his speech that the Laishui battle was the most important one among all the fronts of the Beining, Jinpu, and Ping Sui fronts that the Communist bandits launched when the suppression headquarters was established. The Communist bandits' goal was not achieved, and more than 40,000 people were annihilated, wounded, and killed, and more than 4,000 people were captured, and more than 3,000 guns were seized. Our army lost 1,100 people killed and 1,800 wounded. Two regiments of Lu's army and Li's division had four battalion commanders killed, one regimental commander, and one division commander. Fu continued: The families of the two generals lived in hardship, not as good as the primary school teachers in Peiping. Such sacrifice for the sake of doctrine, for the people, and for the country is truly inspiring and admirable. Fu called out, "Those who worship money and power in the city today should look at the soldiers fighting on the front lines and in the mountains." Fu also said: Although the Communist bandits have reached the end of their rope, it is necessary for every compatriot to do their best to defeat and annihilate their rebellious forces.

### Construction of Tanggu New Port Progressing Smoothly - Three-Year Project Plan Enters Second Year

[Our Tianjin Correspondent] After the resumption of work at Tanggu New Port, the first achievement was the completion of the ship lock project, which the Japanese had completed 80% of, on December 15, 1946, and its opening to navigation was announced. Since then, passenger and cargo ships have continuously entered and exited Tianjin through the ship lock. From August to December 1947, it was temporarily closed for dredging the channel. During the eight-plus months of navigation, according to New Port statistics, a total of 1,143 ships passed through the ship lock, including 168 paying passenger and cargo ships, 35 free ships, and 940 passages by the port's own vessels. The total tonnage of the ships was 299,508 tons, and the total tonnage of cargo carried was 195,250 tons. This number is far from the ideal annual throughput of 6 million tons for the New Port, but it symbolizes the practical value of the ship lock.

Last Year's Project To complete the port construction project with an annual throughput of 6 million tons, New Port began its three-year plan in 1947. The first year's project has now been completed on schedule. The main projects include six items: Breakwater Project. This project is divided into three sub-items: 1. Rock dumping project: The original plan for the first year was to dump 150,000 tons of rock. Due to transportation difficulties and insufficient rock supply, the actual amount of rock dumped was 100,050 tons. 2. Adding concrete block project: This project involves adding concrete blocks weighing 22 tons each on top of the breakwater rocks to prevent erosion by seawater. A total of 90 blocks were added in 1947. 3. Adding concrete ring project: This project is similar to the concrete block project. Each ring weighs 13.5 tons, and a total of 28 rings were added in 1947. Dredging Project: The planned amount of dredging in 1947 was 2.8 million cubic meters. This work actually exceeded the planned amount, with a total of over 3 million cubic meters of mud dredged. The channel depth has now been dredged to 4 meters below the Dagu level, and the first and second wharves have been dredged to a depth of 6 meters. Dock Project: A dock with a length of 100 meters and a width of 11.6 meters has been completed. The bottom of the dock is 3.5 meters below the Dagu level, and the top of the dock is 4.7 meters above the Dagu level. Power Plant and Substation: One of each has been completed. 1,300 wooden piles ranging from 13 to 40 feet and 88 steel sheet piles ranging from 9 to 11 feet were driven for the construction of the plant and substation. 1,100 cubic meters of concrete foundation work was completed. The power plant now has two 2,000-kilowatt generators and has begun supplying power. Three wharf warehouses with an area of 3,000 square meters have been completed. 6.2 kilometers of railway have been built. In addition, the incidental projects for 1947 include: First, the repair of a coal loading machine that can load 300 tons of coal per hour. Second, the completion of three 650-foot water wells with a total water supply of 1.5 million gallons. Third, a total of 38 sunken ships were salvaged from the water.

This Year's Plan According to the New Port Engineering Bureau's work plan for the 1948 project, the important works are divided into seven items: Breakwater Project: It is planned to dump 300,000 tons of rock, extending the southern breakwater from its current 9.5 kilometers into the sea to 10.5 kilometers, and extending the northern breakwater from its current 7.9 kilometers into the sea to 10.5 kilometers. In this way, the southern breakwater is still 5.1 kilometers short of the planned total length of 16.8 kilometers, and the northern breakwater is 3.3 kilometers short of the planned total length of 13.8 kilometers. Dredging Project: The planned total amount of dredging is 6.5 million cubic meters. Among them, the channel depth will be deepened by 3.5 meters from the current 4 meters below the Dagu level, and the channel width will be expanded from the current 50 meters to 70 meters. The depth from the first wharf to the main channel will be dredged to 6 meters below the Dagu level, the depth from the second wharf to the main channel will be dredged to 8 meters, and a 9-meter deep water berth will be completed in the middle. In addition, the barge wharf will be dredged to a depth of 3 meters. Wharf Project: In addition to continuing the unfinished work on the first and second wharves, it is also decided to complete a barge wharf with a total length of 370 meters. In addition, a 200-meter long and 6-meter deep repair wharf will be built. Road Repair Project: Including adding 8 kilometers of railway and 37,000 square meters of highway. Warehouse and Factory Project: Including adding five 3,000-square-meter warehouses to the first wharf, adding a 2,000-kilowatt power plant, a carpentry factory, a foundry, a forge, and a shipyard each. Loading and Unloading Equipment: A floating crane with a lifting capacity of 150 tons, two cranes with a lifting capacity of 25 tons will be added, in addition to the construction of another coal loading machine that can load 300 tons per hour. Shipbuilding: It is decided to purchase a self-propelled dredger and a powerful icebreaker. Special attention is paid to the self-propelled dredger because the existing fixed dredgers are not suitable for dredging channels. In 1947, the ship lock was closed for four months due to channel dredging.

The Value of New Port The authorities' expectations for Tanggu New Port have made it a substitute port for the northern port in Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan. However, whether it is sufficient to undertake the task of the ideal northern port is a matter of opinion among Chinese and foreign experts, and they have different views. From the perspective of a certain period in the future, the Japanese have already laid a foundation for the construction of New Port, so continuing construction to completion and seeking its utilization is a relatively economical plan. However, port construction is a century-long plan, and New Port has many weaknesses. Li Shutian said: "Port construction should be viewed with a telescope, not with a microscope." Li is making a long-term calculation. He pointed out that the basic weaknesses of New Port are, first, that New Port is too far from the deep-water line, almost 40 li, while the Qinghe Estuary is only a few li from the deep-water line; secondly, New Port is a dead water bay, and the problem of winter freezing is particularly serious; and most importantly, dredging work will require a large amount of manpower and financial resources to maintain. Before the Hai River can be clarified, this work will inevitably be a heavy burden. However, with constant wars and national construction progressing like a snail, it would still be a great achievement if the New Port project could be completed on schedule.

### Attempt to Overthrow Nehru's Moderate Regime - Indian Extremist Conspiracy Exposed - Police to File Public Prosecution Against Godse Within a Week

[Reuters, New Delhi, 1st Day] Police Headquarters announced that Godse, the murderer of Gandhi, could be publicly prosecuted for murder within the week. The police have also arrested five other suspects related to the case, including two of Godse's brothers.

[United Press, New Delhi, 1st Day] Defense Minister Patel announced tonight that a dangerous plot to assassinate Nehru has been uncovered, and many people have been arrested. Patel and Education Minister Karan were also on the assassins' target list. However, he did not state whether Gandhi's recent assassination was part of this plot, only saying that the case is currently being tried in court, and it is not convenient to comment at this time, but there is no doubt that it was a conspiracy. Earlier, the police announced that the secretary-general of the Mahasabha, Tai Xi Pant, had been arrested, but the charges were not announced. The group is a militant Hindu organization whose aim is to make India a religious country. Its doctrines are based on ancient Indian law, and it propagates hatred of Islam in its ideology.

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 31st Day] The New Delhi police authorities are investigating the assassination of Gandhi and have arrested fifteen people in Mumbai. They said that the assassination was part of a conspiracy to carry out exploratory actions near New Delhi. The fifteen people arrested are accused of being related to Godse, the assassin of Gandhi. Godse is a Hindu extremist and editor of the newspaper Vadna. According to the police, Godse admitted that he and five others conspired to assassinate Gandhi. The bombing of the Bela Temple on January 20 was also their responsibility. Godse said that after the bombing failed, they decided to assassinate Gandhi individually, the police believe that they came here from Mumbai's most reactionary Hindu district, Buna, carefully formulated a plan, first assassinated Gandhi, then assassinated Nehru and other moderates, and then assassinated Muslim leaders such as Mu Zha Na, in order to overthrow Nehru's moderate regime. The police said that the conspiracy was organized by members of the Mahayana Buddhist Society, a secret Indian organization, which attempts to drag India backwards and restore the Middle Ages. They advocate that Hindustan belongs to the Hindus, impose bloodshed or change of faith on Muslims, cancel Pakistan by force, and restore the ancient beliefs of Hinduism. The Mumbai police believe that the fifteen people arrested are directly related to the assassination. It is said that they drew lots to decide who would assassinate Gandhi. It is said that Godse is a madman in Mumbai. He edited an extremist newspaper in Buna, opposing Gandhi and the National Congress. [Agence France-Presse, Mumbai, 31st Day] It has long been heard that members of the Hindu Mahasabha Party are trying to assassinate all the important members of the Congress Party. It is reported that the Mumbai police have now found conclusive evidence and arrested five people. A thorough investigation is still in progress. Yesterday, when the crowd learned that the assassin of Gandhi was a member of the Mahasabha Party, their anger was directed at the party's organizations in Mumbai and Buna. The thugs in Buna attacked public buildings related to the party and planned to set them on fire. The police repeatedly tried to repel them with batons. The residence of the chairman of the Mahasabha Party and the residence of the assassin's brothers were destroyed by the thugs. There were accidental incidents such as shootings and knife wounds in Mumbai, and the situation here is still extremely tense this afternoon.

### Mumbai Situation Has Eased - Police Claim the City Has Returned to Normal - Arson and Looting Still Occurring in Buna

[United Press, Mumbai, 1st Day] The police bureau claimed today that after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the violence in the city which lasted for twenty-four hours, has now returned to normal, street cars and buses, which were suspended for thirty-six hours, have resumed operation as usual this morning. [Agence France-Presse, Mumbai, 31st Day] Recent unofficial sources say that as of 5 p.m. after the riots here, twenty-two people have died and sixty-one have been injured. Martial law is still in effect in the riot areas, and the authorities have been able to control the riots here at 6 p.m.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 31st Day] A large conflict occurred between crowds in northern Mumbai and supporters of the Indian Mahasabha (Hindu political group). Police suppressed the conflict, firing their guns ten times, resulting in widespread looting of shops, and five people injured. A large crowd in central Mumbai attempted to burn down the dormitories of Indian Volunteer Corps members, but were stopped by the police. The unrest in Buna has not ended, with arson and looting occurring frequently. The police have repeatedly opened fire, injuring more than 20 people, two of whom were shot. The homes of members of the Mahasabha and the Indian Volunteer Corps in Kolhapur, the capital of Kolhapur State, 160 kilometers south of Buna, have been robbed and burned, with losses amounting to tens of thousands of pounds. A thirty-six-hour lockdown has been announced since 10 p.m. A group of communists in Bezwada, Madras Province, clashed with members of the Indian military organization RSS, with some people injured and arrested.

[Reuters, Mumbai, 1st Day] Angry crowds continued to gather in northern Mumbai this morning, determined to destroy the homes of Indian Mahasabha leaders and sympathizers. The police persisted in suppressing the crowds, firing their guns without effect. The army was dispatched to suppress the crowds, and the atmosphere in the city was unusually tense.

### Nehru Speech - Criticizes Militants

[Agence France-Presse, Amritsar, 31st Day] Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech to the people in Amritsar, the holy city of the Sikhs, today, criticizing militants. It is said: "The war and new events will destroy India's reputation in the international arena. Militants who want to seize power should also do so in a legitimate manner."

### Reforming the Congress Party - Gandhi's Pre-Death Plan - Advocate for Serving Farmers and People

[Reuters, New Delhi, 1st Day] The draft plan for reforming the Congress Party, completed by Gandhi just hours before his assassination, is now in the custody of a Congress Party leader. Some of the opinions in the plan may be submitted for discussion at the next meeting of the Congress Party Working Committee. The full text is two pages long, and its content is very radical and revolutionary. Authoritative sources revealed that Gandhi also advocated that the Congress Party should be a national body organized by servants of the people, believing in the principle of non-violence. Although Gandhi did not oppose the dissolution of the existing Congress Party structure, when the new institution composed of servants of the people could inherit its position, the existing Congress Party should be composed of faithful followers serving India's 750,000 villages, with the sole purpose of serving the people. The people would form groups to elect leaders, and then the leaders would elect one all-India Congress Party leader. Gandhi insisted that comrades who faithfully serve the people must wear homespun cloth, abstain from alcohol, respect the sacredness and equality of all religions, and not discriminate against class, bloodline, or gender. They must also take improving rural culture, improving rural sanitation, and serving the rural areas as their purpose.

### India and Pakistan May Reconcile - Resolve the Kashmir Issue Themselves

[Reuters, Washington, 31st Day] A spokesman for the Indian Embassy said that the Indian delegation participating in the Security Council's debate on the Kashmir issue may soon withdraw to New Delhi. This move is effectively equivalent to India withdrawing its protest regarding the Kashmir dispute from the Security Council's agenda, and at the same time, it shows India's willingness to seek a solution with Pakistan themselves. [United Press, Karachi, 31st Day] Pakistani government officials today joined the ranks of Hindus, watching the immersion ceremony held by Hindus on the beach, to show respect for Gandhi. At the same time, all of Pakistan is on alert to prevent riots that may be caused by Gandhi's assassination.

### U.S. Warships Dock in Italian Ports - Italian Approval Obtained - Italy Responds to Soviet Protest

[Reuters, Rome, 31st Day] A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Italian government has ordered its ambassador to Moscow to inform the Soviet government that the visit of U.S. warships to Italian seaports had been approved by the Italian government in advance. The Soviet government had protested to the U.S. government last week regarding the U.S. warships' use of Italian ports. The Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that before the U.S. warships arrived in Italy for a visit, the Italian government had been contacted through diplomatic channels and obtained the permission of the Italian government. Naval ships from other countries are also welcomed by the Italian government to visit Italian ports. The spokesman also said that only the Italian government has the right to decide whether any protests are reasonable.

### Vandenberg and Connally Support European Aid Plan

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 1st broadcast: Washington report, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee continued to hear opinions today. Senators Vandenberg and Connally unanimously expressed their support for the European Recovery Program. They attached particular importance to the second year of the implementation of the plan, believing that the success or failure of the entire plan depends on it. As for the first year, assistance should focus on "food, fuel, and fertilizer" to lay the foundation for recovery.

### Draft of the Five-Nation Western European Treaty; French Foreign Ministry Studying; Content Similar to Dunkirk Treaty

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] It is understood that the French Foreign Ministry is studying a draft treaty of alliance drafted by Britain, to be proposed individually by Britain and France to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Its content is very similar to the alliance treaty signed by Britain and France in Dunkirk. It is expected that France will not have major objections to this draft.

The next step will be for the French government to offer opinions on the draft proposed by the British government, and then draft a final version to be submitted to the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg for study. Observers in London believe that until the content of the final draft is determined, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will not express further opinions than when they formally welcomed the Anglo-French proposal. Those familiar with the matter believe that the British proposal for a five-nation alliance treaty differs significantly from the Dunkirk treaty in one respect: the Anglo-French alliance treaty emphasizes mutual defense against future German aggression as its main characteristic, while the five-nation alliance treaty is less emphatic on this point. The reason is that the inclusion of West Germany within the scope of the Marshall Plan, and the possibility of West Germany eventually joining the Western European Union, must be carefully considered in the five-nation alliance treaty.

[United Press, Luxembourg, 1st] During a meeting of the foreign ministers of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on the 1st, an agreement was reached on a "framework for economic posture," and a joint plan for Germany was agreed upon, marking a further step forward in the plan for a Western European alliance. The specific details of the economic posture were not specified in the meeting's communiqué.

### Soviet Suggestion to Cancel Four-Power Military Government in Austria

[United Press, London, 1st] Radio Moscow broadcast today that Soviet General Verassov, commander of the Soviet occupation zone in Austria, suggested at the Allied Control Council that the four occupying powers unanimously abolish the military government, withdraw the military police, and grant greater powers to the government. Mr. Verassov suggested the following six points: Abolish civil administrative organs under the jurisdiction of the government and the military government. Transfer judicial power to Austrian courts, except in cases detrimental to the occupying powers. Abolish the military police organization, or at least limit the judicial power of the military police to crimes involving opposition to the Allied powers. Transfer urban traffic control to Austrian police. Before repatriation is completed, those awaiting repatriation should be managed by Austrian government law, and the Austrian government should be allowed to establish bilateral repatriation agreements with relevant governments. Transfer all radio stations controlled by the military government to Austrian hands without compensation.

### Deep-Sea Exploration Postponed

[United Press, Beijing, 1st] Professor Piccard and Mr. Coxins planned to conduct deep-sea tests in the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa, originally scheduled to dive to 14,000 feet below sea level. Professor Piccard told the United Press on the 1st that due to an accident involving the ship and the fact that the Gulf of Guinea has entered the storm season, the diving has been postponed indefinitely.

### French Free Exchange Market Scheduled to Open Today

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 31st] It was announced here today that new conditions for foreign exchange trading will take effect from February 2nd. The official opening of the market will be from 1:15 PM to 2:30 PM. All transactions must be conducted in cash, and must be at least US$2,000 or 25,000 Escudos (Portuguese currency).

### Soviet Attempt to Establish Red Base in the Middle East; Large Numbers of Jews Migrate to Holy Land from Soviet-Controlled Areas

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 31st] The secret news that about 20,000 Jews from the Soviet-controlled regions of Ukraine and the Balkans have migrated to Palestine since October of last year has now been partially revealed. Among them, 5,000 people each hold two official passports, one from the Balkans and the other an official passport issued by the Soviet Union. This secret news was revealed by the "Latest News" newspaper. The newspaper stated that this clearly shows the Soviet Union's extreme desire to gain a foothold in Palestine and establish a Red base in the Middle East.

### Huge New Soviet Budget; Military Spending Reaches 66 Billion Rubles

[Reuters, Moscow, 31st] The Supreme Soviet held its fourth session in the Kremlin today, with Marshal Stalin personally in attendance. The marshal, wearing a gray military uniform, was in high spirits when he entered the hall, and all the deputies warmly applauded and welcomed him. Foreign Minister Molotov and key members of the Politburo were also present. When Finance Minister Shverev delivered his speech on this year's budget, he mentioned that "under the wise leadership of Marshal Stalin, the Soviet people are actively progressing towards communism," which triggered thunderous applause throughout the hall. Mr. Shverev subsequently reported that Soviet military spending this year decreased by 2.5 billion rubles compared to last year, totaling 66 billion rubles, accounting for 17% of the total budget. Spending on public health and education has increased sharply compared to last year. This year, there will be 33 million elementary school students and 722,000 middle school students nationwide, both exceeding the planned targets for 1950. Funding for health research has increased by 7% compared to last year.

[United Press, Washington, 31st] The new Soviet budget announced by Moscow seems to indicate that the Soviet Union has exceeded the United States in military spending. However, it is believed that comparing the figures is of little significance because the relationship between the ruble and the dollar is very difficult to determine. If calculated at 5.3 rubles per dollar, Soviet military spending would reach $12.1886 billion. President Truman has proposed a defense budget of $11.025 billion for the current year starting July 3rd, which is about $2 billion less than the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union estimates a surplus of $9 billion. Truman estimates a U.S. surplus of $487 million.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 31st] A spokesman for the Jewish defense force Haganah said that another 400 to 500 Syrian Arabs, in 35 trucks, have entered Palestine from Syria to join Arab guerrilla forces. Many Palestinian Arab leaders are waiting to welcome them at the border. These troops are then dispersed into small groups and stationed near Nablus.

### General Cunningham Likely Dead; Search for Missing British Plane Underway

[United Press, Hamilton, Bermuda, 31st] Thirty aircraft were dispatched today to expand the search for the missing British plane, which is feared to have crashed in the storm-swept Atlantic. The plane carried 29 people, including Air Marshal Cunningham.

### New Indonesian Cabinet Formed; Hatta Appointed Prime Minister; Sjahrir and Others Not Included

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 31st] Officials in Yogyakarta announced tonight that the new cabinet of the Republic of Indonesia has been formed. The new cabinet has a total of 16 members, with no leftists. Most of the important positions are held by members of the Islamic Party and the Nationalist Party. Former Prime Minister Sjahrir and Mr. Shariffuddin both declined to join the cabinet.

### Tokyo International Tribunal; Rebuttal Phase Ends; I Present Confidential Documents on Japanese Aggression Against China

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] The rebuttal phase of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal ended this afternoon. The most confidential documents submitted to the court as evidence in the prosecution of Tojo and the other 24 major war criminals totaled more than 160. According to these documents, most of them are excerpts from the hotly debated and highly publicized Saionji diaries. These diaries are documents that reveal the inside news of some important Japanese political affairs to the world. Mr. Xiang Zhexun, the Chinese prosecutor, presented some confidential documents from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, proving Japan's crimes in China. Most of the documents were used to prove that Kenji Doihara and Seishiro Itagaki planned the "Manchurian Incident" and that they subsequently implemented heinous policies in controlling the three northeastern provinces. A secret document from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted by the Chinese prosecution team to the court stated that on August 7, 1937 (one week before August 13), the Japanese cabinet had decided to send a large army to Shanghai to begin hostile actions against China, placing Shanghai in the same situation as Japan's invasion of North China. The Chinese prosecutors also read out several resolutions from the meetings of the five Japanese cabinet ministers during the court hearing on the crimes committed by the defendants in North China. These records show that the Japanese government had formulated a secret policy to force President Chiang to step down and to place China under Japanese control.

### New Federation of Malaya Established; Singapore Workers Strike in Protest

[Reuters, Singapore, 1st] Thirty thousand workers belonging to the British Commercial and Industrial Workers' Union, under the call of the communist-controlled General Federation of Trade Unions, went on strike today, bringing the port and urban transportation system to a standstill. This strike was in protest of the establishment of the new Federation of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur. Many places throughout the city were decorated with left-wing "People's Flags" to mark this "day of grief." At the inauguration ceremony of the Federation of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, Gent, the former Governor of Malaya, formally took office as the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya. The Federation of Malaya is composed of the nine Malay states and the two colonies of Malacca and Penang. Singapore did not join the Federation of Malaya and remains a British Crown colony.

### Sacred Gandhi Ashes Entombment Ceremony; Gandhi's Relatives and Friends Barefoot Reciting Scriptures; Three-Hour Ceremony Moving

[United Press, New Delhi, 1st] Hindus today held prayers around the sacred ashes of Mahatma Gandhi on the banks of the sacred Jamuna River, and the ashes were then placed in a brick altar. According to Gandhi's sons, Davidas and Ramdas, it has yet to be decided whether to scatter the ashes in the Jamuna River or the Ganges, or to keep a portion. Indian industrialist Bolar stated that he has decided to donate the Bolar Mansion, where Gandhi was assassinated, to the nation, and its use will be decided by Indian leaders. The entire ceremony of entombing Gandhi's ashes lasted three hours and was held inside a barbed wire fence set up by the military. The scene was moving and in stark contrast to the chaotic order of yesterday's cremation ceremony. Inside the barbed wire were Gandhi's relatives and friends, all barefoot, reciting Hindu and Islamic scriptures and singing Christian hymns, while the audience was outside the wire. The brick altar was decorated with flowers, and relatives and friends formed a circle, walking slowly around the cremation pyre three times, finally kneeling in front of the pyre, with some people touching their foreheads with ashes, symbolizing that the Mahatma had left the mortal world.

The True Arguments Finally Convinced the President

The greatest threat to trade agreements did not come from foreign countries, nor from the Republican Party, nor from certain manufacturers or planters, but from within the Roosevelt administration itself, represented by George N. Peek, former director of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration.

In March 1934, the President appointed him as a foreign trade advisor. If Mr. Roosevelt had hit me in the face with a sledgehammer, I don't think I would have been more stunned than by this appointment. Just as a person, Peek was the most affable and likeable. He was very loyal to his views and never let go once he held them. But I believed that his economic views were unsound. If they were to replace the sound economic policies upon which our trade agreements were based, it would inevitably lead to the most profound tragedy. His efforts, and those of his colleagues, sometimes with the President's assistance, almost crowded out my entire international economic policy and implementation plan. I wanted to promote these policies and plans throughout the world in order to improve economic prosperity and peace.

Peek often brought whole baskets of statistics to the White House, and the President supported his statements to the press. He gave the President a memorandum urging him to hand over the power to manage all foreign trade policies and negotiations to him. If this were done, he would deprive the State Department and the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, and Finance of any real say in any aspect of foreign trade. Fortunately, I was able to prevent this development.

Then, Peek went to negotiate barter agreements with foreign countries—a method that Europe was using, and which we hoped to eliminate through trade agreements based on the principle of equal treatment. His starting point was undoubtedly sincere, because there were indeed surplus American goods at the time that had to be disposed of abroad. But he completely failed to see that such barter agreements could not coexist with trade agreements.

The Trade Agreements Act was aimed at broad policies and broad trade methods, not at individual barter transactions. A basic point of our trade agreement policy—that is, equality of commercial treatment and opposition to all kinds of discrimination and preferences—would be openly undermined by Peek's barter proposal. Our plan was to broadly provide export facilities, especially for these surplus items such as cotton, tobacco, lard, wheat, and automobiles, by reducing foreign discrimination and preferences and promoting equal trade treatment. In my opinion, maintaining this policy around the world was extremely important.

Throughout the summer of 1943, my colleagues at the State Department and I spent a great deal of time refuting Peek's theories. The contradiction reached its peak in November and December 1934, when Peek negotiated a barter agreement with Germany. On the one hand, Germany openly delayed the payment of $2 billion in debt to the United States that had already matured, thus maintaining the worst credit with American creditors, while on the other hand, it pretended to want to establish a fair trade agreement with us. At the same time, it tried to appease other countries by temporarily repaying its debts and trade arrears.

Hitler's economic magician sent a delegation to the United States, and Peek negotiated an agreement with them. This agreement had all the standard characteristics of Hitler's way of dealing with people, just as Hitler and Schacht grabbed other countries by the throat and forced them to accept it. We should sell 800,000 bales of cotton to Germany through the Export-Import Bank, and Germany would pay the Export-Import Bank in US dollars for a quarter of the total price. As for the remaining three-quarters, it would be paid in German currency, plus interest of 22.5%. The Export-Import Bank could sell this currency to American importers who purchased German goods at a discount in order to pay for these goods.

While this transaction was being negotiated, I argued against it with the President to the best of my ability. I felt that the President's interest in foreign trade policy was much less than it had been before he ran for and was elected President. After he devoted himself to studying domestic reforms, he had very little time to study international economic relations. From my contact with him, I didn't believe he was paying close attention to foreign economic relations.

On November 19, I received an informal notice from him saying:

"As with most of the problems that you and I have dealt with over the years, there are always two sides to the argument. In purely theoretical terms, you and I agree, but sometimes we have to modify a principle in order to deal with a rigid and helpless fact! Look at the large amount of Japanese cotton cloth that has flooded into the Philippines in the past six months." "I think it would be very helpful in many ways if you and Peek, who sees trade issues from an extremely practical point of view, could spend an hour or two one evening discussing the issue of the most-favored-nation clause."

In all practical terms, this method was tantamount to asking me to invite Peek and, in effect, abandon my plan and let him replace me in economic leadership. I was thoroughly convinced that the President and Peek were wrong about this extremely important issue. There is no room for compromise on the point of equal treatment. Either you get equality, or you get inequality. You cannot make both work at the same time. The Trade Agreements Act established the principle of equal treatment for trade agreements. If this principle were amended, then the "rigid and helpless facts" that the President mentioned would become even more rigid and helpless.

I did invite Peek. But, as I had fully expected, our conversation about his proposals was completely unproductive. On November 28, 1934, I wrote a letter to the President in Warm Springs, Georgia, and sent him three memoranda on commercial policy. I said, "To the best of my knowledge, all government departments are in complete harmony with the views expressed herein, with the exception of our friend Peek. The press, in general, is supportive of us, as I told you on the train."

A few days later, I left Washington for Nashville, Tennessee, to prepare to give a speech on agriculture and trade agreements. When I returned to Washington, my assistant, McBerrett, met me in Charlottesville, Virginia, and brought an urgent letter issued by Undersecretary of State Philipp on December 13. The letter began: "In the past two days, a change has occurred with an unexpected abruptness, and I know that this change must be very difficult for you." He reiterated the facts, saying that Peek and the President had a meeting on December 12, after which the White House notified the State Department that the President had approved the barter agreement negotiated with Germany. Philipp telephoned the White House and obtained a guarantee from the President that no final decision would be made until I returned.

As soon as I returned to the State Department, my colleagues and I immediately gathered the arguments against bartering with Germany, which I presented to the President. I told him that our trade agreement plan would be in serious danger. We are currently negotiating an agreement with Brazil, and we have now received a protest from Brazil. Brazil is also a cotton exporter, and it said that if we concluded this preferential agreement with Germany, it would be forced to take the same measures and delay signing an agreement with us.

I pointed out that this transaction was equivalent to subsidizing German imports into the United States. By selling German currency to importers who purchased German goods at a discount and allowing them to use it to pay for imported German goods, they could obtain goods from Germany at a lower price than they could obtain the same goods from other countries.

This transaction stipulated that the mark should be converted into US dollars according to the old gold standard exchange rate, thus overturning the devaluation of the US dollar, at least as far as Germany was concerned.

I said that our cotton exporters might not actually be able to obtain US dollar foreign exchange by selling goods to Germany. There was no guarantee that they would not be forced to sell cotton at a loss. The US government may suffer other losses through the Export-Import Bank.

I also said that the barter method was based on Peek's belief that we had no other way to sell cotton to Germany. In reality, the opposite was true. I felt that Germany needed cotton so much that it would buy at least 500,000 bales and would try to find US dollar foreign exchange to pay for them.

In addition to the details of all these arguments, there was one fact that was particularly important, and that was that this transaction was discriminatory rather than based on equal treatment. Every type of goods that Germany exported to the United States therefore gained a special benefit, and every country that exported this type of product to the United States would inevitably protest and possibly take retaliatory measures. The Chilean ambassador told us that if German fertilizer had preferential treatment in our market, as stipulated in this agreement, then Chile would be forced to dump nitrates here.

I said: "This transaction is extremely discriminatory against Americans, but it is an extremely good barter deal for Germany; the United States gains very little and takes great risks... The proposed plan will almost certainly arouse extreme hatred among most Americans who strongly oppose the Hitler regime."

Fortunately, the President saw the truth of these arguments. He withdrew his approval of Peek's deal. This also marked the end of Peek's attempts to negotiate similar transactions with other countries. From then on, the new proposals contained in the trade agreement principles and plans constantly weakened Peek's plan, eventually crushing it. I kept explaining the soundness of our plan to the President, especially the extreme necessity of equal treatment. In a memorandum to the President on February 15, 1935, I said: "Our country can adopt the old methods with other countries, limiting its trade activities to an extremely narrow scope, only doing some barter and bilateral trade transactions, but it is clear that in the past few years, our exports have increased by 450 million US dollars, while all European countries, using this narrow barter agreement and bilateral trade treaty with hundreds of methods and measures to increase exports, have only gained so much. Understanding this, we cannot do this."

I pointed out to Mr. Roosevelt that our first step was to eliminate or reduce excessive tax rates, including those that completely or virtually eliminated competition, or those that had been in place for a considerable period of time and had not resulted in domestic production being able to satisfy more than 10% to 15% of total domestic consumption. At the same time, tax rates applicable to extremely ineffective commercial or industrial goods, or to various kinds of fancy goods, luxury goods, semi-luxury goods, things that are substantially different from domestic products, or commodities that are different in use, should be eliminated or reduced as long as they do not cause serious competition with American products.

Two months later, Peek's office was abolished. The trade agreement was saved, and the subsequent results fully proved that our opposition to Peek's ideas was well-founded.

### Suspected of Detaining Dancers and Employees, Interrogated Overnight, Released on Bail in Batches; Sun Hongyuan and 107 Others Escorted to General Bureau

[Our Newspaper] The second day after the dance industry crowd vandalized the Social Bureau, the police bureau announced that 642 men and women were arrested on the spot the previous day. Subsequently, more than a hundred suspected individuals were arrested, totaling 797 people, who were detained separately in various branch bureaus. Starting at 2:00 PM yesterday, the police bureau, after obtaining approval from the mayor, transferred 107 men and women who were identified with evidence to the General Bureau for strict interrogation.

Weekend and holiday dance patrons felt greatly at a loss, and some even went to inquire about the whereabouts of the dancers. The families of the arrested dancers and employees brought clothes to various police bureaus to visit and deliver supplies yesterday. Some gathered in the dance halls to discuss and inquire about news. They were overjoyed to learn late at night about the news of early release after interrogation. As for the 797 arrested dancers and employees, 91 were detained in the Songshan Branch Bureau, including 71 dancers and 20 employees. 205 were at the Penglai Branch Bureau, including 50 dancers and 155 employees. 27 dancers were at the Jiangning Branch Bureau. 106 employees were at the Huangpu Branch Bureau. 110 employees were at the Lujiawan Branch Bureau. 41 employees were at the Jing'an Branch Bureau. 30 employees were at the Xincheng Branch Bureau. 96 employees were at the Laozha Branch Bureau.

Formal strict interrogation is scheduled to begin today. In the future, depending on the severity of the circumstances, they will be sent to the District Attorney's Office or the Garrison Command. Apart from the 107 people, the rest were interrogated overnight, with the Mayor's approval from Director Yu, recording their statements and then releasing them on bail successively. It is expected that all will be released by this morning.

### Preparing to Resume Business Today

It is heard that in addition to having retained lawyer Chen Tingrui to continue filing an appeal with the Executive Yuan according to law, the Dance Industry Association is also trying every means to bail out Sun Hongyuan and other relevant personnel. Meanwhile, they are preparing to resume business today.

The dancers, employees, and police officers who were injured in the confusion the night before were sent to Nanyang and Guangci Hospitals for emergency treatment. Some left after brief treatment, while those with more serious injuries were transferred to the Police Hospital that night. Yesterday, many dance patrons brought flowers and fruit to Nanyang Guangci to visit, but learned that the dancers had already left, and they returned disappointed.

Mayor and Bureau Director Send Representatives to Console Injured Police Officers

[Our Newspaper] When the dancers and employees vandalized the Social Bureau the day before, Song Tingjun, the chief of the Songshan Police Branch Bureau, and dozens of police officers were injured while maintaining order on the scene. Mayor Wu specially sent the chief of the Public Relations Section to express condolences yesterday. Yuan Wenzhang, director of the Fourth Division of the Social Bureau, and Shen Xingfan, director of the Personnel Office, also represented Director Wu and went to the Police Hospital at 11:00 AM yesterday to console Lu Bolang, the squad leader of the motorcycle team, Wei Liankui, number 5192, Feng Ruoyu of the Flying Fortress, number 5953, Li Qing of the Motor Vehicle Team, number 5054, Liu Yunting, number 5293, and Xiong Weichao, the section chief of the First Section of the Songshan Branch Bureau, who was recuperating at home. Each person was given a consolation money of one million yuan and candies. In addition, it is planned to give bonuses, but the amount has not yet been determined. Among them, Director Xiong suffered internal injuries, so Director Yuan specially went to Director Wu's private residence to obtain Yunnan Baiyao as a gift.

The Mastermind of Vandalizing the Social Bureau, Chairman Fang, to be Severely Punished

City Party Headquarters Chairman Fang, regarding the petition and vandalism of the Social Bureau by dance hall employees and dancers, issued a statement saying: "Director Wu of the Social Bureau has repeatedly petitioned in Nanjing for the ban on dancing. His care for colleagues in the dance industry and his efforts to seek a compromise are obvious to all. Now, the petition is not based on proper action, but openly vandalizes government agencies, insults officials, disregards the government, and is utterly lawless. We are certain that the several incidents that have occurred in Shanghai recently were premeditated by ambitious elements. Therefore, in each action, unidentified elements participated. The disturbances at Tongji University were the same, and the vandalism of the Social Bureau was the same. The slogans and banners are bizarre and reactionary to the extreme. This is definitely not what rational dance hall employees and dancers who are trying to solve their livelihood would do. These large numbers of traitors hidden in Shanghai, the scourge of the people, will not be removed for a single day, and Shanghai society will not be peaceful for a single day. We deeply hope that the military and political authorities will deal with this matter strictly, thoroughly investigate the masterminds, bring them to justice, and punish them with the most severe penalties so that the demons will be exposed and the evil winds will be eradicated. Then the citizens will be fortunate. As for the dancers' transfer to other professions, I will do my best to serve the people and discuss the aftermath with the authorities."

Commander Xuan Issues a Statement Resolving to Suppress Violence and Evil Trends

Shanghai has experienced two major shocking events within 48 hours: the transformation of the Tongji student unrest into violence against Mayor Wu on January 29, and the vandalism of the Social Bureau by more than 3,000 petitioning dancers and dance hall employees on January 31, which deeply grieved the security authorities. Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu told a Central News Agency reporter one day that this kind of evil trend is just beginning and must be strictly suppressed to deter others from following suit. The leaders of the past two incidents will be severely punished, and the masterminds behind them must be investigated and never let go. When the reporter asked Xuan about the disposition of the three responsible persons of the dance industry groups who were arrested in the vandalism of the Social Bureau, he replied that Sun Hongyuan, chairman of the Dance Hall Owners Association, Yong Zongjie, chairman of the Dance Hall Workers Union, and Xiang Yunyuan, director, are currently being thoroughly interrogated by the police bureau. Both labor and management participated in the crowd petitioning the Social Bureau, resulting in the act of vandalism. They are the responsible persons of both labor and management, and of course, they should be held responsible. However, what resolutions they made during the meeting, what their original intention was in going to the Social Bureau, and whether they intended to vandalize the Social Bureau are all important keys to determining the severity of their crimes.

### Dance Halls Not Immediately Banned; Still to be Eliminated in Two Phases

[Our Newspaper] Director Wu, after working tirelessly day and night, felt quite exhausted in spirit. He told reporters last night that no instructions have yet been received from the central government regarding the handling of this matter. The dance ban issue will still be based on the original plan to eliminate dance halls in phases and will not be immediately banned because of the dance industry's inappropriate actions yesterday. As for the extent of the damage to the Social Bureau, it is currently impossible to estimate, but the details have been reported to the municipal government for verification.

### Jin Meihong's Mother Cries and闹s at the Association, Using This Newspaper as Evidence to Plead for Her Daughter's Injustice

[Our Newspaper] Jin Meihong, one of the dancer representatives, was arrested the night before and is temporarily detained at the Songshan Branch Bureau. Her mother cried and闹ed at the Dance Industry Association yesterday, and showed people the photo published in this newspaper, saying: "She clearly waved her hand in the photo to stop others from vandalizing, how can you say she participated in the leadership?" It is heard that Jin also denied participating in the vandalism during the interrogation. Most of the dancers in custody cried bitterly all day yesterday, all saying they were forced to participate and regretting being imprisoned, thinking of their families having no means of support, and feeling remorseful.

### Social Bureau in Ruins After Looting; Broken Chairs and Tables Piled in Corners, Employees Resentfully Clean Up the Remnants

[Our Newspaper] Although yesterday was Sunday, staff from all departments of the vandalized Social Bureau still went to the bureau to work, engaging in arduous "aftermath" work. The main iron gate on Linsen Middle Road was closed, and passersby stopped to look at the damaged building, casting concerned glances. Inside the bureau, staff from all departments, under the supervision of Director Wu, Deputy Director Li, and various section chiefs, helped the workers clean up the broken and chaotic scene. The windows of the rooms that were broken into and vandalized were pierced with holes and temporarily covered with wooden boards and paper to avoid the cold wind. Broken and incomplete tables and chairs were piled in every corner, or documents and pieces of paper that had been torn up and thrown away. It was not until late at night that some order was achieved. However, there was a shortage of desks and chairs in each office, so today they can only make do and prepare to piece together long tables for dining to use as offices. Sundries and utensils will be gradually added and replenished.

The losses in each room, in addition to tables, chairs, utensils, and sundries, included the city-wide business registration cards of the Industrial and Commercial Registration Section of the First Division, which were overturned on the ground. Fortunately, they could still be collected and sorted out without much loss. However, the documents, books, and receipts in the Grain Section were all torn up, including important documents such as the data for the implementation of the comprehensive grain allocation, the rice allocation roster, the government's sales of rice accounts, and relevant grain statistics. Working staff felt annoyed trying to find and sort through the piles of paper on the ground one by one. In addition to resentment, they hated the vandals with a passion.

### Personal Belongings and Salaries Also Missing

In addition to public property, many employees' personal belongings were also lost in each room. Among them, the five-part form for the in-kind allocation to public school employees and the salaries that had just been issued not long ago were often placed in drawers or under glass tops, and were all reported missing amidst the chaos. Deputy Director Li's American wool hat and fountain pen, which he had placed in his office because he was attending a labor-management evaluation meeting in the conference room, and the travel expenses issued for the labor-management evaluation were also lost.

The bureau specially notified all divisions and sections yesterday that all kinds of certificates, such as flags and armbands, left behind when the dancers and employees vandalized on January 31, should be submitted to the document section immediately for filing and handling. If anyone can identify names and faces, please report them as well.

### Chief Prosecutor Huang Personally Comes to Inspect

He specially made a long-distance phone call from Nanjing yesterday to express condolences to Director Wu of the Social Bureau.

### Using Petition as an Excuse to Carry Out Riots; The Social Bureau Orders the Dissolution of Three Dance Industry Organizations

[Our Newspaper] After the dancers and dance hall employees vandalized the bureau during the petition, Director Wu believed that their actions were extreme and illegal, and decided to order the dissolution of the Shanghai Dance Hall Business Association, the Dance Hall Workers' Professional Union, and the Professional Musicians Association, ordering them to cease activities immediately. The police bureau will dispatch police to execute the order, and request a strict investigation. The dissolution order will be issued today. In addition to reporting to Mayor Wu and Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, it will also be sent to the City Chamber of Commerce and the General Labor Union for notification. The text of the order is as follows: "It is found that the association used the excuse of a petition to lead members to gather at this bureau on January 31 of this year to carry out riots, vandalizing public property, obstructing official duties, and disrupting social order, which is extremely inappropriate. According to Article 18, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the People's Organization Law During the Extraordinary Period, it should be dissolved, and personnel will be sent to reorganize it. In addition to requesting the Shanghai Police Bureau to execute this order, it is hereby ordered to comply without delay."

### A List of Material Losses Totalling 500 Million

### Students in Shanghai Escaping from Communist Areas Publicize the Atrocities of the Communist Bandits

The Shanghai Refugee Student Propaganda Brigade is organized by middle and high school students who have escaped from the Communist-controlled areas. Having personally experienced the suffering of being ravaged by the Communist bandits, they will publicize the facts of the Communist bandits' atrocities to society to raise the vigilance of people in the rear. The brigade members, numbering more than 90, set out for the first time yesterday morning to carry out propaganda in various districts of the city. They spoke with tears in their eyes when promoting their cause in various theaters and dance halls, which moved the audience. Everyone shouted slogans to exterminate the Communist bandits, and the atmosphere was extremely tense.

Party Headquarters Propaganda Brigade Bravely Promotes Propaganda in Disguise in the Rain

Since its establishment, the Propaganda Work Brigade of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang has been actively carrying out propaganda work for suppressing rebellion and building the nation, and has been quite busy.

In addition to reviewing the work of each district team, there was a detailed discussion on the future work. After the meeting, all the brigade members braved the rain and went to Longhua, Caohejing, and the Southern District to carry out propaganda in disguise. More than a thousand spectators attended, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic.

Shrinking in Small Sheds, Hundreds of Thousands of Poor Compatriots are Wrestling with Death; Packages of Dead Children are Found from Time to Time in Secluded Alleyways

The poor compatriots in Shanghai who live in shantytowns can be roughly divided into five districts: South Shanghai, West Shanghai, North Shanghai, East Shanghai, and Pudong.

Looking at the map of Shanghai, in South Shanghai, starting from Dadongmen to the south, the shantytown area begins from Mietu Street and Kuaitu Alley behind Xiao Jiu Hua Street. Further south to Wangjia Wharf of the Penglai District Office, the southwest Nancang Street, Zhangjia Alley, Qinglong Bridge Street, Gongguan Street, Duojia Road, and other places are all there. Further south, along both sides of Lujiabang Road, from Waima Road through Lima Road, Caodui, Chihetou, Haichao Road, Kualong Road, to Puyu East and West Roads, the middle of this area is all dirty and crowded shantytowns. Then, from the Hu Min Nan Zha Road to the northwest to Hualang Road, not even reaching the Jinren Road to the south and to the Zhizaoju Road to the west, this small square block also houses many people struggling in the mud.

Unimaginably Bad

Further west into the Songshan District, north starting from Xie Xu Road, and south also reaching the wilderness and not even reaching the Zhenren Road, in this block, except for the northeast and the middle, which are not very large, the rest are densely packed, with Luban Road Yu She Li, Jumen Road Yuan Song Village, Xie Tu Road Lane 83, Lane 275, and No. 245 Xieqiao Road next to the most.

In the Lujiawan District, the north also reaches Xie Xu Road as the boundary, and the south is the same. After passing Dapu Road to the west, it is not very concentrated. Only around the Pingyin Bridge at the intersection of Rihui Road and Xie Tu Road is it slightly denser, with Luban Road Xiangda Li, both sides of Dingxiang Zen Temple on Xie Xu Road, Xie Tu Road, and Dapu Road being the most. The shantytowns at the intersection of Luban Road and Xie Xu Road and the shantytowns at the intersection of Luban Road and Liyuan Road can be said to be the worst shantytowns in Shanghai, simply unimaginably bad. Shantytowns are relatively sparse in the Changshu District to the west.

The distribution of shantytowns in South Shanghai is like a small pocketknife lying horizontally, long from east to west and short from north to south. The north is roughly bounded by the river on Xujiahui Road, and the south reaches the open countryside. Most of the coolies do odd jobs, with a total of about 15,000 households and more than 80,000 people.

Dirty, Chaotic, and Poor

Further west, there are only some scattered shantytowns along the river on Xujiahui Road. After passing Xujiahui, from Xuzhen Road to the west, at the place where it is about to meet Ciyou Road, it is called Pingmin Village, where there are many shantytowns. Further west and then turning northeast, the sides of Hongqiao all the way to the radio station on Hongqiao Road are all straw sheds. From Fan Yu Road to the north, from the Shanghai West Railway Station along Changde Road to Jiangsu Road, around Zhongshan Park, such as West New Street, Sujiajiao, North and South Pig Bristle Factories, Lu Xuezhai, Yaojiajiao, and Sunjiazhai are also where they gather.

Entering the Jiangwan District to the northeast, the Jiangwan District is a very concentrated area of shantytowns. West of Jiaozhou Road is all a mix of small and medium-sized factories and shantytowns. To the south are Taiping Li on the west side of Fanhuangdu, and Jinjia Xiang on the north side, Kangjia Bridge on Yanping Road. To the north, from Yuyao Road to the east, almost every alley has straw sheds. The large areas with large populations include North Yao, Lane 681, Lane 641, Lane 607, Lane 501, Lane 488, Lane 487, Lane 468, Lane 467, and Gonghe Li. South to Kangding Jiang, Fanwangdu Road, and north to Changshou Road and Anyuan Road, the area is very large, dirty, chaotic, and poor.

Dense Zhabei Area

The Putuo District has fewer shantytowns. Apart from Lane 624 on Anyuan Road, and Yaoshui Alley and Caoxiebang at the end of West Kang Road, concentrated straw sheds are rare, while the rest are very scattered. In addition, some residents in ordinary tile houses, although better than straw sheds, still live below the poverty line, such as Xinglongfang, Meifangli, North and South Yinghuali, and Tokyo Li on Tokyo Road in Changshou Road. The West Shanghai District roughly has about 15,000 households.

The Zhabei area is also very dense, generally referred to as "Hamabei." The ground in this shantytown area is very large, reaching Qingyun Road in the suburbs to the north, the area near the Hu Tai long-distance bus road to the west, the railway to the south, and Zhiyuan Road to the east, and is concentrated. In the areas of Zhongxing Road, Yongxing Road, Qiujiang Road, Taiyangmiao Road, Jiaotong Road, Jingjiang Road, and Datong Road, it is almost impossible to find a small Western-style house, or even ordinary tile houses are rare. The land is wide, and the people are dense. There are also many in the Xinjiang Road and Gonghe Road areas south of the railway, totaling nearly 8,000 households and about 50,000 people.

Not Many in the North Sichuan Road District

There are not too many shantytowns in the North Sichuan Road District, but they are all concentrated in the Xiangyan Bridge area. North to Quanjiaan Road, west to Qimei Road and Liyang Road, south to Tianai Road, and east to the river. They are all in this area. They can be seen from any alley. In addition, north from Qimei Road, on the west side of Qimei Road and near the Qimei Road Bridge, there are also many.

Extra in the Tilanqiao District

Past Xiangyan Bridge is the shantytown of the Tilanqiao District. This is also very concentrated. The west reaches the river, the northeast is bounded by Sharong Road, and the southeast is bounded by Yuezhou Road and Wuzhou Road. In this triangular area, all the lanes on roads such as Sharong Road, Hongzhen Street, Linping Road, Wuhua Road, Kulun Road, Tongzhou Road, Tianbao Road, Zhangjia Xiang Road, Hailar Road, Ruyi Road, and Gaoyang Road are also crowded together. In the Yulin District and the Yangshupu District, they are scattered in blocks. East from Zhoujiazui Road, at the place where it meets Tangshan Road, there are several small blocks here. There is a large block in Lane 536 on Liaoyang Road. South across Kunming Road is another large block. Further south, there is a block at the intersection of Huoshan Road and Tongbei Road. West on Huoshan Road, before reaching Jingzhou Road, is another large block. Continuing south, both sides of Fulu Road, Lane 75 Longjiang Road, opposite Lane 163, Xiaomuqiao, in front of the Zhongfang No. 1 Factory on Qiqihar Road, opposite and on the right side of the Zhongfang No. 16 Factory, at the intersection of Lanzhou Road and Jianlin Road, and at the intersection of Changyang Road and Kunming Road on Qiqihar Road, and Gaolangqiao North, each location has more than three or four hundred households.

There are many factories and wharves in this area, so there are also many shantytowns, totaling about 20,000 households and more than 100,000 people.

Their Innocence

Across the river from Yangshupu, along Pudong to the west, there are only some scattered shantytowns on both sides, such as Maqiaohang Road, Yangjing Port, Jiajiaqiao, the intersection of Minsheng Road, Zhaopu Road, and Yaojiazhai. Some are very bad, and some are okay. The number of households is not too many. Turning from Yangjiazhai to the Pudong South Road to the south, there are about a hundred households near Xiaoshi Bridge and Pushan Villa. From the police bureau road to the southeast, east to Pudong South Road, west to the wharves and warehouses on the Huangpu River, and south to Xiejiazhai, Pudong Electric Company.

In this area, except for the two gaps of Lujiabo and Xiejiazhai, the rest are very dense. Such as near the Lingxiu Elementary School on Pudong South Road, Yangjiabo, Yujiamiao, before and after Yangjing Middle School, Lao Baidu South Street, Xiechangli, Rongchang Road, Dongchang Road, Lane 69, Lane 170, Lane 188, Lane 316, Lane 228, Lane 551, Lan Nidu, Beihutang Road and other places, there are a total of about 6,000 households and more than 30,000 people. The above is a rough description of the distribution of shantytowns in Shanghai.

At this time of freezing cold, these hundreds of thousands of people are trembling in small sheds and wrestling with death. If you turn into some secluded alleyways, you will find packages of dead children or frozen old people from time to time. They are innocent, but this is their destiny and destination. I hereby write down what I have investigated to provide reference for the sponsoring relief agencies and charitable organizations. At the same time, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association has collected this material as a basis for running children's welfare stations.

### Serious Social Problem: Female Prison Also Suffering from Overcrowding; Yu Aizhen's Handiwork is Excellent; Yu Xiangyan's Temper is Somewhat Arrogant

[Special Report from this Newspaper] The impression gained after visiting the female prison is that it is clean and orderly.

The female prison is located in a corner of the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison. It is a four-story Western-style building. The space is not large, but it houses over 240 female prisoners, which makes it appear extremely crowded. Originally, the court allocated space with the initial assumption that there wouldn't be too many female prisoners. Unexpectedly, in times of war and chaos, the number of women committing crimes has gradually increased. It is said that the detention center of the District Court alone holds over a thousand female prisoners. As sentenced prisoners are successively transferred to the female prison, there is already a problem of being unable to accommodate them.

When we visited, each female prisoner was engrossed in knitting woolen sweaters, which is one of the largest production activities in the prison. She Aizhen, the wife of Shi , and Ye Jiqing, the wife of Li Shi, were both quietly working. According to Section Chief Li Meihun, Yu Aizhen's handiwork is excellent and she has a gentle disposition, while Ye Jiqing's work is relatively poor. As for Yu Xiangyan, the female protagonist in the embezzlement case of the Two-Roads Bureau Materials Department, she has a bad temper, appears somewhat arrogant, and is not interested in working. In addition to knitting woolen sweaters, other work includes threading, making shoes, making Western-style children's clothing, embroidery, laundry, making toothbrushes, powder puffs, gloves, and pasting matchboxes, etc.

Mostly Gluttonous and Lazy; Appropriate Education is Provided

Last December's net profit was over 15 million yuan. Workers receive bonuses, which are divided into four grades according to their diligence and skill: 25%, 20%, 15%, and 10% of their earnings. According to Section Chief Lin Xiaoming, these female prisoners were mostly extremely lazy at home and did not know how to do anything. After receiving instruction in prison, only four female prisoners can now make fine-quality clothing, which shows how much they usually enjoyed eating and disliking work. In addition to working, they receive daily education, which is divided into eight classes based on their level of knowledge, with courses in Mandarin, arithmetic, common knowledge, and music. Those with higher levels of knowledge are instructed to keep diaries to observe their thoughts and conduct.

Eight Innocent Babies Living the Same Prison Life

Special attention is also paid to spiritual transformation. Miss Zhu from the Moore Memorial Church Women's Evangelistic Band, Sister Pan from the Catholic Church, Miss Li from the Christian Church, and the Salvation Army take turns giving sermons, hoping to transform these female prisoners with Christian teachings so that they can become good people after their release.

Many female prisoners were already pregnant before entering prison and gave birth in the female prison. There are now eight little babies in the female prison, who are cared for by wet nurses. The oldest baby is less than one year old, and the youngest is only two months old. These little angels smile and open their little mouths when they see people, unaware that their mothers are living behind bars. The Children's Welfare Promotion Association visited recently and, seeing the pitiful babies of these prisoners, sent five cases of milk and a large bottle of cod liver oil.

Not Afraid of the Law For the Sake of Survival

Prisoners are allowed to receive food from their families once a week and visit with their families once every two weeks. Drug-related offenses are the most common type of crime. According to Section Chief Li, during these drug offenders' family visits, it can be seen from their tone of conversation that their families are still engaged in selling and transporting drugs, and they are not deterred by the fact that they are facing charges. This is indeed a serious social problem. For the sake of survival, many people are taking risks. Seeing the number of criminals in society increasing day by day, we wonder how much power the law and prisons really have.

### Quarrel Over Debt Leads to Secret Revelation; Investigation Traces Back to Yangjiazhai, Anren Street, Nanshi; Counterfeit Money Operation Busted

[Report from this Newspaper] Han Lao Zhong, Chen Zhi Cai, Wang Xiao Qing, and Ju Ling Zhi, four trainee patrol officers from the Putuo Road Police Station, were patrolling Changshou Road around 8:00 PM on the 30th of last month when they heard a quarrel near the entrance of Da De Cloth Store at No. 88. They entered the store and learned that Zhang Asheng was ordered by his cousin Ju Zhongda to return 1 million yuan in cash to the store. A partner discovered that each bill was a 5,000-yuan counterfeit note. Zhou, who resides at No. 85 Tokyo Lane, Tokyo Road, was arrested by Patrol Officer Han and others. Six million seven hundred and fifty thousand yuan in counterfeit notes were found at the home of his neighbor, Xu Baowang. Zhou confessed that the counterfeit notes were purchased from Lu Huanrong in the thatched shed of Bai Guocao on Jiangpu Road for 4.5 million yuan in legal tender in exchange for 10 million yuan in counterfeit notes. They then went to the aforementioned location and arrested Lu, who confessed that he bought them from Fang Qiao at No. 65 Yangjiazhai, Anren Street, Nanshi. The officers then went to Nanshi, arrested Fang, and seized counterfeit printing plates, manufacturing machinery, and a stack of printed and unprinted counterfeit notes at his home. They were taken to the station for strict interrogation, but they refused to confess fully. The case was periodically submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Student Aid Application Forms; All Issued for University and Middle School Groups

The 37th Annual Spring "Reader Student Aid Fund" organized by this newspaper has been proceeding smoothly since fundraising began on January 12, thanks to the enthusiastic support and constant donations from caring readers. As the winter vacation has ended and the spring semester is approaching, this newspaper has been working diligently on investigation and registration work in recent days. As for the application method, the previous year's method of school recommendation will continue to be used in order to simplify procedures and improve efficiency. Application forms for universities and colleges were issued a few days ago, with a total of 210 copies to 20 schools such as St. John's. Application forms for middle schools were also issued yesterday, with a total of 320 copies to 70 schools such as Huxin.

Students applying should take note.

### Housing Dispute at Ling Liang Church; Former Director of Social Affairs Bureau Welfare Department Leads Crowd to Evict Residents; Church Members Indignant and Appeal to All Parties

[Report from this Newspaper] The Ling Liang Church and affiliated Ling Liang Elementary School at the intersection of Liyang Road and Tiantong Road in Hongkou, as well as the house where Reverend Zhao Shiguang of the church resides, were suddenly forcibly occupied by Zhai Dianrong, who claimed to be from the Kaina Housing Rental Office, and a dozen others on the morning of the 26th of last month. They brought suitcases, bedding, and other items, stayed overnight unlawfully, and forcibly converted the reception room and classrooms into "offices" and "staff dormitories," throwing Reverend Zhao's personal belongings out the door. The next day, Ling Liang Elementary School held a closing ceremony, and they wrote in white paint on the walls, "Housing Recovered for Own Use" and "The Housing Here Has Been Returned." At the same time, they cut off the water pipes, causing dozens of people to panic over drinking water, and the telephone was also damaged. The next day, they invaded and occupied the female staff dormitory on the third floor. One of the female teachers surnamed Xia was bedridden with illness, but they disregarded her. Reverend Zhao's mother-in-law is old and seriously ill, and her illness was aggravated by this fright. Those living in the church are all elderly women, weak women, and children. They wailed and were anxious due to this disturbance, making a pitiful sight. Although Reverend Zhao negotiated with them and reported it to the police, there were no results. The church members are all extremely indignant about this and are appealing to all parties. Yesterday was Sunday worship, and Reverend Zhao could only preach to the believers in the open air.

It is reported that the building at No. 1040 Shenyang Road was originally the police dormitory of the Japanese consulate, and there was also a church in it. After the victory, it was taken over by the Bureau of Social Affairs and allocated to the staff of the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Central Trust Bureau. The church portion was allocated to Reverend Zhao Shiguang for the establishment of the Ling Liang Church. Originally, it was considered enemy property, and the residents paid safekeeping fees to the Central Trust Bureau. In February of last year, the property rights of the above-mentioned building were approved by the agency handling enemy property to be returned to the original owner, Kenna, a Czech citizen, and the original residents continued to rent the property. At that time, Kenna was eager to go to the United States and asked the residents to elect a representative to sign a contract with him. All the rent would be collected from the residents by the representative and paid at once. At that time, Cai Dianrong was the director of the Welfare Department of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. Without being publicly elected by the residents, he acted as a representative and signed a rental contract with Kenna, starting from June 1 of last year. Since then, he has acted as a sub-landlord. Reverend Zhao has now received a letter from Robbie Gike, Kenna's trustee, stating that no one may occupy the Ling Liang Church property until Kenna returns to Shanghai, and Reverend Zhao has full authority to reside there. Please inform Cais that he must wait until Kenna returns to Shanghai in May of this year before the shareholders make a decision . Cai's actions are illegal.

### Military Industry Road Shelter Continues to Accommodate Refugees

[Report from this Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau and Chairman of the Winter Relief Committee, addressed the criticism from the outside world regarding the No. 3 Military Industry Road Shelter in Yangshupu. He stated yesterday that the shelter was recently established and has been accepting opinions from all parties. It has continued to forcibly accommodate refugees. Ten vehicles from the police station and the bureau are dispatched daily to various places, resulting in the accommodation of more refugees. Clothing and bedding for the refugees are being distributed daily. The heavy workload of refugee relief this year is truly beyond words. The Winter Relief Committee sincerely hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will provide more assistance. The committee also welcomes churches, organizations, and other enthusiastic people to work in the shelter so that the refugees can benefit more.

### Hai Zhe Ship Arrives This Morning; Delayed by Heavy Fog Outside the Yangtze River Estuary

[Report from this Newspaper] The Hai Zhe ship, carrying the second batch of Japanese reparations materials returning to the country, arrived at the Yangtze River estuary on the 31st. However, due to heavy fog, it was unable to enter the port. The small wheel carrying personnel from the China Merchants Bureau and Customs returned to the city at around 3:00 AM. According to a reporter from Shen Wan, the ship is expected to enter the port at 9:00 AM this morning.

### Various Factories Request to Purchase the First Batch of Japanese Reparations Materials

[Report from this Newspaper] The first batch of Japanese reparations materials arriving in Shanghai, including those available for private enterprises, have been concentrated in the warehouse at the China Merchants Bureau's No. 7 Wharf under the custody of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office and have not yet been unpacked. The application period for private factories to purchase them is set from January 8 to March 15 of this year. The Guidance Office has prepared various forms and guidelines, priced at 100,000 yuan per copy, to facilitate applications from factories. It is reported that a considerable number of factories have applied. Some are going through the procedures with the Guidance Office, while most are directly contacting the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Although this batch of materials was dismantled from Japanese military factories, they consist of small machine tools that can be used by various industries. Therefore, the industries that applied last month were mainly cotton mills and coal mining companies. The allocation price of the reparations materials still awaits a decision from the Price Evaluation Committee. Factories that moved inland previously requested preferential treatment, but there have been no results to date.

### The Shanghai Drivers' Union Establishes its Ninth Branch

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Drivers' Union established its ninth branch yesterday. The branch has more than 400 members, all of whom are drivers from the Municipal Public Transportation Company. The inaugural meeting was held in two sessions. More than 60 night-shift drivers attended at 11:00 AM, and more than 200 day-shift drivers attended at 4:00 PM. Seventeen directors and supervisors were elected in succession, and Ma Yunlong was elected as the director-general. The establishment of the branch was repeatedly opposed by the company authorities, who believed that the Public Transportation Company is a municipal enterprise and that automobile drivers have civil servant status and should not join the union. However, the drivers' union stated that the number of Public Transportation Company drivers who voluntarily wished to participate accounted for two-thirds of the total, and a branch could be established in accordance with the law. It will file with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs today. As for the rumored brewing strike, it is absolutely untrue. The union also stated that it is willing to cooperate with the company authorities in the future to resolve any problems. It also stated that Huang Bingfang, a union director (who is a driver for the Transportation Company), was fired for participating in the preparatory work of the ninth branch, and the union is now legally demanding reinstatement, but it will not use a strike as a threat.

### Xinjiang Problems: Thirty Years of Shadows and Future Prospects - Special Correspondent for this Newspaper

— Ma Cibo

The Xinjiang problem should be viewed holistically. The origins of all problems have a cause-and-effect relationship. To seek a thorough solution, one cannot approach it piecemeal from a local perspective. It is necessary to consider the overall trend and make a complete transformation to achieve practical results. The Xinjiang governance plan, written based on the spirit of peaceful unification, democracy, and solidarity, will forever be supported by the people of Xinjiang. It is a legal code for resolving the entire Xinjiang issue. Zhang Zhizhong will vigorously promote his new policies in Xinjiang. He has pledged to implement the true nationalism of the Premier in Xinjiang, ensuring equality for all ethnic groups within the country. Since the implementation of this new policy, the status of Han people in Xinjiang will be reduced from rulers to ordinary citizens, appearing in Xinjiang society only as a regular ethnic group. This is a blow and a satire to the superior Han Chinese mindset, because the Xinjiang regime has always been in the hands of Han people, from the Border Defense Commissioner and Provincial Governor to the third-class bailiffs in the county government, all monopolized by Han people. Their method of treating Xinjiang compatriots has a catchphrase: "Three kind words are not as good as one horsewhip," meaning that the people of Xinjiang only have the freedom to be beaten, not the freedom to speak. This oppressive political tradition has caused countless disturbances in Xinjiang. They also say that disturbances are a hobby of the Xinjiang people, with a formula of a minor revolt every thirty years and a major revolt every sixty years. The ruling class never admits their own mistakes, creating a revolt, followed by a conquest, beautifully named "punishing the people for their crimes."

Adopting a Democratic Attitude, Dealing with it Generously and Calmly

General Zhang Zhizhong could not bear to let this historical cycle of evil continue to unfold and decided to create a new page in history and open up a new political path. Xinjiang has thus undergone a complete transformation. A large number of Han administrative cadres have been eliminated, and outstanding talents from indigenous ethnic groups are employed as much as possible to participate in administrative work. General Zhang has truly shown utmost kindness and courtesy to compatriots of the Turkic language family. Whatever they asked for, he approved. For example, reducing the burden on the people, issuing tax exemption orders, releasing political prisoners detained over the years, and approving the return of people's property confiscated by the former Commissioner's Office. Reaffirming the decree protecting the people's personal freedom, ordering the prohibition of marriage between Han and Uyghur people, abolishing the medical office, disbanding the trading company, reducing the size of the National Army, adjusting personnel of various administrative commissioners, and electing county chiefs, etc., all are implementing democratic politics in a step-by-step manner according to the demands of the people. However, the four million compatriots in Xinjiang only have two paths psychologically: either planning to be the ruling class or preparing to be the ruled. There is no second political habit besides these. The sudden appearance of a democratic government with a spirit of the times has aroused great psychological contradictions among the Xinjiang compatriots who have no democratic experience, seemingly misunderstanding the true meaning of the democratic spirit. A small number of Uyghur compatriots who call themselves progressives, with the support of Yining, formed a group that is anti-national, anti-National Army, and anti-Han Chinese, becoming rampant in various places. First, on July 5, 1946, they murdered aviator Jin Xueqin in Antarctica, and the murderers and suspects were forcibly taken away by the crowd during interrogation, threatening the dignity of the law. At the same time, women married to Han Chinese were dragged into mosques and forced to remarry, causing disturbances in the city of Dihua. Those who were considered pro-Han ethnic traitors were often beaten and humiliated by the masses. Then, the leader of the group sent by the provincial government to the Ashan area to supervise the election, Tu Yuze, an outstanding member of the Kazakh ethnic group, was killed on the way. Refugees who had returned from the Soviet Union after the peace were massacred and humiliated in Tacheng. Transportation in Yining was intermittent, the army refused to be reorganized, the administration refused to be unified, and the arrogance of the violent elements in Dihua remained high. They once surrounded the Highway Bureau, the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Health Department, and provincial government meetings, proposing 48 unreasonable demands, causing the February 25th bloodshed incident. After the breakup of the Provincial Senate, the Beitashan incident and the Turpan unrest occurred one after another, leading to the resignation of Vice Chairman Ahemaitijiang. Throughout this series of unfortunate events, General Zhang Zhizhong has always adopted a generous, peaceful, and democratic attitude, hoping to turn big problems into small ones and small problems into nothing. Today, Vice Chairman A is still corresponding by letter, hoping that he will return soon to discuss further. Anyone with a fragile spirit cannot withstand this kind of political pressure and feels the crisis of peace, even doubting the correctness of General Zhang Zhizhong's policies.

No one dares to guarantee how long peace in Xinjiang can be maintained, but one more day is always better than one less day. People who are concerned about the Xinjiang issue but do not fully understand the situation in Xinjiang will certainly doubt the current policy, believing that General Zhang Zhizhong's generous and democratic approach is sufficient to increase the arrogance of those who are anti-national and anti-Han Chinese, seeming weak and powerless. In fact, the thoughts and remarks against the country and against the Han Chinese in Xinjiang are partly a legacy of history and partly the temptation of external forces. They are not produced under a peaceful and democratic political system. We cannot therefore think that peace is hopeless. This is precisely the goal of our efforts to strive for peace. At the same time, the environment in Xinjiang is different from that in the interior. Although there are no party disputes, it is directly controlled by an invisible force, and the situation is quite complicated. We must recognize that the force supporting the Xinjiang issue is not in Xinjiang. The vast number of Xinjiang compatriots of all ethnic groups are the object of our struggle and sympathy, not the object of our struggle. Therefore, a generous, peaceful, and democratic policy is sufficient to increase the internal role of the four million people, strengthen the stability of peace, and create our political advantage. Therefore, General Zhang Zhizhong's peaceful, democratic, generous, and patient political style is not a show of weakness to Yining, but to win over the four million compatriots in Xinjiang and bring them into the heart of the country.

The Most Favorable Situation, Peace is the Grasp

The most favorable situation for us in Xinjiang is peace. One more day of peace, one more minute of preparation, one more minute of preparation, the more grasp we have. This year's situation is much better than last year's. If we maintain it for another year, next year will certainly be more optimistic than this year.

Dealing with things on a temporary basis and dealing with things on a long-term basis are fundamentally different. When we read the notes of the negotiations of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Li Hongzhang, under the threat of Japanese imperialism, the constraints of corrupt Manchu nobles and princes, and the condemnation and opposition of the people of the whole country, assessed the situation and decisively signed the unequal treaty that humiliated the country. He retreated to prepare for reform, progress, and strive for rejuvenation. Today, we realize that Li Hongzhang's vision was far-sighted, his chest was broad, and his spirit was magnificent, enough to be an immortal figure in history. The peaceful resolution of the Yining incident this time cannot be compared with the nature of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, because the Treaty of Shimonoseki is the most humiliating page in the history of national humiliation. The resolution of the Yining incident not only dealt with a serious diplomatic offensive, but also resolved internal ethnic disputes. It is an important task of China's political construction, but the difficulties encountered in the negotiations were only one assassin less than the Treaty of Shimonoseki. From the point of view of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, Li Hongzhang and Zhang Zhizhong are really no different.

Although the Xinjiang issue cannot be completely resolved due to the success of peaceful negotiations, our country has officially consulted on the sovereignty of Xinjiang territory since the peaceful negotiations. This is a fact. For more than a year, relying on General Zhang Zhizhong's efforts, there has been a preliminary stable situation. In the future, if we want to seek long-term peace and stability, we must have practical performance and carry out various constructions. This cannot be done by the power of Xinjiang itself. Human and material resources must be assisted by various departments of the country. As long as the country is willing to spend money, the future of Xinjiang is hopeful. The reason why Li Hongzhang could not revive China was that his ideals and plans could not get the support of the court and the cooperation of his colleagues, and he was depressed. We hope that the future of Xinjiang will not follow this path.

Yining's Power is Weak, it is Difficult for a Mantis to Stop a Cart

Ahemaitijiang's departure from Dihua did not attract the attention of any Xinjiang people. This proves that he has lost a pivotal role in Xinjiang politics. In the past year, he has exhausted all his political capital and has not achieved much. His followers have disintegrated, his manipulated people's riots have failed, and his plan to control the Provincial Senate and use public opinion to liquidate the Han Chinese regime has also failed. In the end, he could only quietly float back to Yining like a feather. This is the end of his political career. Saying that his departure from Dihua has any impact on the situation in Xinjiang, we really cannot see it, because when he was in charge of the provincial government in Dihua, the three districts of Yita and A were still protecting their special status, and it was just the same after he left Dihua. Saying that he went back to launch a war, the facts are not simple. If Yining wants to launch a war, it can only be an international war, otherwise Yining's small power is absolutely not enough to stop a cart with the arms of a mantis, because the morale and public support of our Xinjiang are not comparable to what they were a year ago. Everyone seems to be confident in dealing with the situation. As for whether someone will launch an international war in Xinjiang at this time, from all aspects, it is still too early. This kind of concern will only arise on the eve of the outbreak of the Third World War. Therefore, my view on the Xinjiang issue is that there is no need to expect to recover Yining in a peaceful way. Even if Ahemaitijiang is willing to turn back, he cannot represent Yining's return to the motherland. The special status of the three districts of Yita and A can only be clarified after the entire world issue is cleared up.

Any Terror Policy Does Not Meet the Needs of the People

After Ahemaitijiang flew back to Yining, there were many rumors in Dihua. Some said that he was actively preparing for war and conscripting young men, some said that he was depressed and had no activities, and some said that his actions were restricted and he had lost full freedom. There is also a rumor that a part of the Communist bandits in the Northeast has been transported to Yining. Let's put aside the situation of Ahemaitijiang for now. However, it is indeed necessary to refute the rumors about the infiltration of the Chinese Communists into Yining. Although the Chinese Communist bandits are a group of red traitors who are ubiquitous, their scope of activities is also restricted by their masters. Xinjiang is a region directly controlled by the International Communist Party, and there is absolutely no room for the activities of the Chinese Communists. During the Sheng Shicai era, the Chinese Communists sent a large number of cadres to Xinjiang, but they could only assist the Xinjiang government in their personal capacity to promote the six major policies, and they were absolutely not allowed to develop the organization of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang. It was not that the Chinese Communists were unwilling to carry out activities in Xinjiang, but that their masters did not allow them to carry out activities. Xinjiang is a backward feudal society, the place with the most Islam. All problems are inseparable from religion, ethnicity, and politics. Political instigation is anti-national, ethnic instigation is anti-Han Chinese, and religion tends to be Turkic-Islamicism. The call of the East Turkestan People's Republic has a trinity effect of religion, ethnicity, and politics. Although the Communists are anti-national, they cannot get rid of their Han Chinese skin. If we use the Communists to help Yining today, it is to drive away the old Han Chinese with the new Han Chinese. In the eyes of the Xinjiang people, although the old Han Chinese are annoying, there are still places to miss them. The new Han Chinese bring a terror policy, and the lessons of Sheng Shicai are not far away. It really does not meet the needs of the Xinjiang people, and it is actually impossible. Rumors are just rumors after all. This kind of rumor may be intentionally manufactured by someone, so I will explain it along the way.

The Election of the Chairman by the People Will Naturally Lead to a Bright Political Situation

At present, the important task of Xinjiang is to improve administrative efficiency, strengthen various constructions, strive for peace opportunities, and get the politics of the seven districts on the right track. As for the brightness of the political situation in Xinjiang, it depends on the future elected chairman. Whether Mr. Maisiwude, who is opposed by Yining, wants to gain the support of the people of the whole Xinjiang, he has to be tested. It depends entirely on his performance during this period of governance. Other possible competitors, on the Han side, perhaps Mr. Chen Xihao, the chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Party Department, will participate. Mr. Chen has been in Xinjiang for many years and can fully understand the crux of the Xinjiang issue and its difficulties. We believe that Mr. Chen's intention is definitely not just to be the chairman of Xinjiang. As for the Hui and Kazakh compatriots, they do not seem to be prepared. On the Tatar side, there is Mr. Bao Erhan, who is the only scholar in Xinjiang. Although he is not used to political life, there is no suitable candidate other than him. There are also Mr. Yimin and Mr. Aisha, who are quite energetic. As long as they do not forget that there are 14 ethnic groups in Xinjiang and can seek happiness for the 14 ethnic groups, it is okay to try it. If we let the four million people of Xinjiang freely elect, we believe that everyone will unanimously support General Zhang Zhizhong, because the people have already felt that only General Zhang can effectively help the people of Xinjiang to seek happiness.

### National Judicial Administration Review Conference Decides to Establish Recidivist Prisons to Eliminate the Accumulation of Bullying

[Report from Suzhou on the 1st of this newspaper] The Ministry of Judicial Administration has learned that prison riots have occurred frequently in various places recently. After investigating the reasons, it is actually due to a small number of prisoners with bad character. Although they are in prison, they still refuse to repent. They bully new prisoners, cause trouble, and lead riots, which is a loss of the original purpose of prisons to detain criminals in the hope that they will repent and reform themselves. After the National Judicial Administration Review Conference decided to establish recidivist prisons to eliminate the accumulation of bullying, one will be set up in each province. All recidivists and criminals with bad character in the province's prisons will be transferred to that prison for execution. Distinctions will be made within the prison, and they will be imprisoned in separate rooms. It is learned that the Suzhou High Court has recently received this notice and has decided to designate Zhenjiang Prison to add single prison cells this year to house recidivists from the entire Jiangsu Province. Before it is completed, the prisons will first imprison the recidivists they are holding separately.

### Huangtiangang Port, a Commercial Port in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River

[Report from Jiangyin on January 30th of this newspaper] Huangtiangang Port in this county has become the lifeline for ships entering and exiting since the bandits appeared in northern Jiangsu. The Council has high hopes for the port improvement plan in the Xinyang Port construction plan. It wants to build wharves along the river and build warehouses. In the future, when the Xiyu Railway is successful and connects to the Beijing-Shanghai line, it will become the only modern commercial port in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Since the failure of the Shengchangde German business to transport flour, on January 15th, a huge cargo ship was not allowed to enter the port without inspection, and five large ships were overturned by wind and waves, resulting in a loss of 6-7 billion. Merchants and travelers regard this port as a dangerous place. This county is located at the throat of the Yangtze River.

The Narrowest River Surface

It is convenient for investigation work, and has always had a checkpoint set up. In October last year, a Jianghai sub-customs was established. They do not pay much attention to ships in the inner harbor. The main thing is anti-smuggling work on the river. Regardless of domestic and foreign merchant ships, they have to stop at the port to wait for customs inspection. They only add inspection and do not collect taxes, because the tax has already been paid at the Shanghai Zhenguan Port. They only need to check the tickets. If there is tax evasion, they will be punished according to the regulations after the inspection. In the past, the customs power was in the hands of foreigners, commonly known as foreign customs. All documents were written in English, and the customs declarations were a combination of Chinese and Western. Because they were opposed, they have now been changed to Chinese. With the customs, there are many customs declaration offices in the port, as many as a dozen. Their business is that every ship entering and exiting needs to report the name, quantity, destination, and location of the goods to the customs office, explain in detail, and verify the documents to request help with customs procedures. The customs office charges some handling fees, but there is no fixed price. Each ship costs tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.

Shallow Water in Winter

The port is small. Every day, there are five ferry companies operating between Jiangyin and Jingjiang across the river, including Jiangjing, Jiangli, Datong, Jiangshun, and Wuhe, with a total of six ferries, each of which can accommodate about 10,000 people. Each passenger ferry fee is 3,000 yuan. Now the water is shallow, and the ferries cannot enter the port. They stop on the river bank, and you have to row a boat to get ashore, which costs 5-6,000 yuan per passenger. If you have cargo, you have to pay double. The ferries operate in shifts, one every half an hour. There are also two shipping companies, Yangzi and Jianzhong, which specialize in transporting goods between Jing and Zhen. The Yidu Bureau is managed by the relief center and is jointly organized by the old Jiangyin and Jingjiang counties. There are now two Yidu boats, which also ferry passengers in shifts and charge ferry fees. Before the war, no ferry fees were charged. In fact, there is no "Yidu" significance anymore. In addition, there are 70-80 ferry boats from the east bank to the west bank, from the inner harbor to the outer harbor. The ferry fee is not fixed. There are different prices for local people and foreigners. The ordinary ferry to the other side of the river costs 3-4,000 yuan, and to the port costs 20,000 yuan. They are most welcome by large merchant ships, because when they drop the anchor to go ashore, report to customs for inspection, and come from the center of the river, it costs at least hundreds of thousands. A ferry boat at the entrance of the customs sub-customs specializes in ferrying customs officers, costing 5,000 yuan each time, and it is operated by one family. Each customs office has an income of several thousand to more than a million yuan a month, which is quite considerable. Because of the congestion of ships, there are river cleaning service personnel,

Specially in Charge

Maintain the order of ships in the port, but if you want your ship to advance first, you need to use money. Those with money are arranged to go first, and those without money are left to stop. It costs hundreds of thousands for a pig boat. Since the unprecedented shipwreck tragedy occurred, all parties have paid attention to the order of the port. After Kong Siling strictly cracked down, the entry and exit of ships in the port has improved. Large and small ships are proceeding one after another, but I am afraid it will not last long and will become boring over time.

The most disputes are the loading and unloading industry organizations. They are divided into several groups, each group operates, and they are very clear and do not infringe on each other. Each group has considerable influence. The port group has the most capital. If someone exceeds the line to unload goods, a martial arts drama will happen immediately. Although the party and government organs have held meetings many times to stipulate, it has not been completely resolved. In the near future, the county government will have to hold another meeting to formulate a practical method to avoid the recurrence of disputes. In addition, there are rickshaw pullers at the port who "ask for prices everywhere and settle on the ground". They

Main Customers

Are passengers traveling to and from the north and south. Many rickshaw pullers gather at the checkpoint and squeeze to the river bank. Ignoring the danger, they swarm onto the ship. They jostle back and forth in the cabin. If there is a customer with luggage, they grab it. From the port to the North City Bus Station, it costs tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, and the price is doubled in the rain. The day before yesterday, a female passenger spent 110,000 yuan to get from the port to the Xiaobei Bridge outside the North City because she had luggage, and the rickshaw pullers fought with each other. If the passenger cannot agree on the price with the rickshaw puller and thinks the price is too expensive, other rickshaw pullers will ask for even higher prices, so you will not be able to get a bargain. If you go to Puhui Bridge, there is no such phenomenon.

Chengyi and Northern Jiangsu Jingjiang are Only

Across the River

To prevent and investigate, a checkpoint is set up at the port, with military police stationed. The inspection is divided into two categories: passengers and ships. The most attention is paid to the identity of the passengers. The goods carried by the ships must be registered, but no fees are charged. Since the shipwreck tragedy, the authorities have sent personnel to supervise everything at the port, which has improved compared to before, and the inspection is completed quickly. There is also a ship management office, which performs its duties at the port. Local people hope that this port will prosper, and then the Xinyang Yin construction plan will have hope of realization.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Announces to Citizens to Pay Taxes in Full

[Report from Zhenjiang on February 1st of this newspaper] The provincial government has recently announced to the citizens of the province, stating that during the period of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, the expenses for important policies such as self-defense and autonomy are huge. It sincerely hopes that the public will pay all taxes in full and share the difficulties. If tax officials are found to be engaged in corruption, they will be severely punished.

### Good News from Nantong's Conscription: Hu Hanyun Draws the First Lot, and his Elder Brother Voluntarily Enlists in Place of his Younger Brother

[Report from Nantong on January 31st of this newspaper] The emergency conscription work in this county has already been launched. There is even a good story about two brothers competing to enlist in the Tangzha Shiyan District of the county. Hu Hanyun, a young man from the Seventh Jia of the Eleventh Bao of Shizhun Township in the district, was drawn in the first lot and immediately volunteered to enlist. When his brother Hu Han-cheng learned about this, he stepped forward and was willing to enlist in place of his younger brother, resulting in the two brothers arguing with each other. In the end, the brother Hu Han-cheng enlisted. The public believes that this brother, who understands the righteousness of suppressing the rebellion and building the country and competes to join the army, is a model for young men of the appropriate age.

[Report from Wuxing on January 31st of this newspaper] The County Conscription Association held its sixth meeting on the afternoon of the 30th and decided to conscript half of the full quota before February 10th, with the principle of sending one recruit from each Bao first. However, it is the time of the strict New Year's Day, and the traffic is cut off. It was requested to the provincial government to approve a one-month extension. It was reported by Section Chief Wang of the County Government that he was ordered to participate in the military section chief conscription conference of twelve counties to discuss important cases: This year's conscription must be done by lottery, and the principle is not to buy volunteers. The living expenses for new recruits are stipulated as follows: Shop households, Class A 600,000 yuan, Class B 500,000 yuan, Class C 400,000 yuan, Class D 300,000 yuan, Class E 100,000 yuan, Resident households, Class A 100,000 yuan, Class B 80,000 yuan, Class C 50,000 yuan, Class D 20,000 yuan.

[Report from Haining on the 1st] The county government held a conscription association on the 31st, and the conscription quotas for each township have been determined and announced, and the lottery method will be adopted. The conscription will be launched from February 1st.

[Report from Wujin on January 31st of this newspaper] The emergency conscription in this county, as of the 30th, has a large shortage. The people in the townships feel that it is difficult for the young men to enlist at the end of the year. Most of the people who handle it draw lots urgently and transmit them at night, which inevitably harasses them. It is difficult to blame them. The South Jiangsu Garrison District telegraphed the county to speed up the conscription to meet the quota, otherwise the conscription would be delayed, and the officials in charge of the conscription would be severely punished.

[Report from Changshu on January 31st of this newspaper] The county government is handling emergency conscription, and the townships have decided to meet the quota within the time limit. County Magistrate Zhang issued a special order on the 31st, stating that it is illegal to allocate the standing self-defense force of the security team to fill the conscription quota, and it will affect the public security. It will definitely not be implemented and strictly orders each township to send enough troops.

### Fengxian Raises and Distributes Living Rice for Young Men

[Report from Fengxian on January 30th of this newspaper] The first phase of emergency conscription in this county will be handed over tomorrow.

The second and third installments will be issued to the respective family members during the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival of this year. The standard for collecting all the living rice will be fairly allocated by the committee members Tao, etc., based on the population, number of fields, and wealth of each township.

### Communist Bandits' Atrocities in Lingyuan, Rehe

[Report from Chengde on January 28th] Recently, the Communist bandits in Lingyuan, Rehe, were afraid that the middle peasants in the Lingyuan bandit area would respond to the establishment of the Lingyuan Homecoming Team by our province, so the Communist bandits' county government secretly sent six instructors to various districts to carry out activities. Each village sent several turned-over members to secretly monitor the middle and rich peasants, and notified each middle peasant family to send one person to the bandit government to attend a meeting to discuss public grain. The middle peasants were all tricked into attending the meeting, and then they were colluded with us. Their names were all detained. At this time, the turned-over members also reported one after another. For example, Nanlu Yi reported more than 80 people. According to incomplete statistics, more than 600 people have been reported in the whole county. If anyone is found to be disobedient, they will be killed by being tied to a dog, a high tree and strangulation. At night, the people were not allowed to close their doors, and they could enter and leave people's homes at night to listen and investigate. During the reporting, the people were strictly forbidden to pass.

### Recent News on "Double Gun" Wang Ba-mei

[Report from Pinghu, this newspaper, January 30th] The movements of "Double Gun" Wang Ba-mei have long been widely discussed. However, recent rumors circulating outside have been largely inaccurate. According to recent news received by this newspaper: the Pinghu Self-Defense Third Brigade she led was reorganized into the Pinghu County Self-Defense Third Company in December of the 30th year of the Republic of China. Later, it was reorganized again into the Security Police. She retired to farming at that time and has not held any positions as commander of armed forces since. Furthermore, in the 35th year of the Republic, she was elected as a Pinghu County Councilor by the members of the Pinghu County Farmers' Association, and her work is quite demanding. The rumors of a mutiny among her former troops are clearly unfounded.

### Zhenjiang Commemorates Farmers' Day with Agricultural Exhibition and Competition

### Huang Shao-hong Returns to Guangxi and Writes a Poem

[Report from Guilin, this newspaper, January 28th] National Government member Huang Shao-hong returned to his hometown after many years to participate in the Legislative Yuan election. He stayed in his home village in Rong County for a few days, then passed through Liuzhou and arrived in Guilin. He carefully investigated the situation along the way and expressed great satisfaction with the province's recovery and reconstruction. Huang is skilled in poetry and prose. In Liuzhou, he was moved by the scenery and wrote a "Lang Tao Sha" poem, titled "Feelings on Returning to Guangxi":

"Returning after ten years away, children line the road, laughing as they look, pointing out the differences from the past, hair graying at the temples.

The road is difficult and arduous, the flames of war have left devastation. Destruction comes easily, but reconstruction is difficult. What survives the calamity, its true face unchanged? Only the green mountains."

These few lines truly express the vicissitudes of the past decade. The homeland's mountains and rivers, new sorrows and old hatreds, fill the spaces between the words.

### 15th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Chemical Society Opened Yesterday Morning in the Capital Wu Cheng-luo Hopes the Government Will Support Pure Scientific Research Zhou Hongjing Emphasizes Research Publications Must Improve Standards

[Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, February 1st] The 15th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Chemical Society opened at 9 AM on the 1st in the capital, chaired by Wu Cheng-luo, Chairman of the Society. More than 100 members attended, including Gao Jiyu, Li Jingsheng, and Chen Yuguang. Nanjing Mayor Shen Yi, Secretary-General Xue Cixin, Director Zhou Hongjing of the Higher Education Department representing Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, and Counselor Zheng Ruogu representing the Ministry of Social Affairs were also present. Chairman Wu Cheng-luo delivered a speech, stating that this was the second annual meeting after the recovery. The overall situation has been unstable in recent years, and the lives of scholars have been very difficult. Although the research results still include more than 30 papers, it is barely satisfactory. However, compared to the past, when each meeting had more than 100 papers, it is indeed inferior. In the future, it is hoped that society and the government can pay more attention to and support pure scientific research such as chemistry, and all members should also encourage each other to intensify research in the face of all difficulties. The Board of Directors has also decided to reprint the Society's journal to inspire research enthusiasm with the glorious historical records of the past. Regarding the implementation of research results, the lack of equipment and funding makes scholars feel powerless. It is hoped that all members and opinion leaders will find ways to bring this to the attention of the government. In addition to considering manufacturers, do not forget the pure scientific research that is the foundation of this industry when it comes to import foreign exchange and low-interest loans. After Wu's speech, Director Zhou Hongjing delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Zhu Jiahua, hoping that the annual meeting would provide opinions on the practical design of research funding allocation, the standards of chemistry courses in universities and middle schools, and the nature of graduate students in domestic colleges and universities. He especially emphasized the need to improve the standards of research publications to a certain level and establish authority. As for the Ministry of Education's subsidies, it will do its best to help. Subsequently, Counselor Zheng Ruogu, representing the Ministry of Social Affairs, and member Chen Yuguang delivered speeches. The meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon, at 2 PM, the discussion of papers began. On the morning of the 2nd, the affairs of the society were discussed. In the afternoon, at the invitation of the Ministry of National Defense and the National Defense Science Commission, a National Defense Science Symposium was held, followed by continued discussion of papers and proposals. On the 3rd, the Yongli Chemical Plant was visited, and unfinished matters were concluded. In the evening at 6 PM, all attending members had an annual banquet, and the conference closed.

### The Ministry of Education Announces the Effectiveness of the Post-War Regional Planning and Establishment of Secondary Schools

[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing Airmail] In the past, the Ministry of Education announced that during the war, secondary schools in various provinces and cities had either been closed, merged, relocated inland, or newly established, and there were many changes. The establishment of secondary schools has mostly lost its balance, so after the end of the war, it ordered various provinces and cities to seize the opportunity of repatriation to plan and establish various types of secondary schools in order to be reasonable. According to the Ministry of Education's summary and compilation of the implementation situation over the past two years, the implementation results are as follows: In general, all provinces and cities can divide middle school districts, normal school districts, and vocational school districts according to the degree of development of population area, economic transportation, and cultural undertakings. The various types of schools in the middle school district, normal school district, and vocational school district are geographically coordinated and can be balanced without excessive density. The distance between different types of secondary schools and junior secondary schools and the central national school can also be properly configured with reference to local needs in order to obtain as much contact and convenience for further education as possible. In addition to the establishment of middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools in accordance with the regulations of the secondary school district, the establishment of schools and the addition of classes are gradually advanced with the following ratios as the goal: (1) Junior secondary schools: The ratio of the total number of classes in the three types of schools, junior middle schools, simple normal schools, and junior vocational schools, is 6:3:2. (2) Senior secondary schools: The ratio of the total number of classes in the three types of schools, senior high schools, normal schools, and senior vocational schools, is 2:1:1. The locations where various provinces and cities set up various types of secondary schools are mostly based on the following principles: 1. Senior high schools and junior high schools are located in areas with a dense population, prosperous economy, and convenient transportation. 2. Simple normal schools and normal schools are located in rural towns and cities. 3. Junior vocational schools and senior vocational schools: (A) All agricultural vocational schools are located in rural areas; (B) All industrial vocational schools are located in places where such occupations can be developed and improved, or are rich in such raw materials for manufacturing, or have such factories for internships; (C) All commercial vocational schools are located in more prosperous commercial cities; (D) The school sites of other vocational schools of various subjects are selected with an environment suitable for the subjects of the schools and convenient for internships. Junior middle schools, simple normal schools, and junior vocational schools are established by the county in principle. The provinces concentrate their efforts to run high schools or senior high schools, normal schools, and senior vocational schools jointly established by high schools and junior high schools. If only provincial junior high schools are set up in each middle school district in each province, they have mostly been changed to provincial senior high schools or provincial middle schools jointly established by high schools and junior high schools. If a senior high school or a senior high school jointly established by a high school and junior high school is already set up in the district, and a provincial junior high school is also set up at the same time, the provincial junior high school has been gradually changed to a normal school or a senior vocational school in consideration. If the provincial high school or the senior high school jointly established by the high school and junior high school, the normal school, and the senior vocational school have been established in the district, the provincial junior high school has mostly been gradually transferred to county management. The secondary schools of various types that were relocated and newly established by various provinces and cities after the war have been ordered to move back to their original locations, or remain at their current locations, or move to designated locations for proper adjustment in accordance with actual needs at the time of repatriation. In areas with too many middle schools, vocational schools have been designated to be converted in consideration of the circumstances, and private vocational schools have been supported and encouraged. Each county can first establish simple normal schools when adding county-run secondary schools in order to meet the urgent need for teachers in national education.

### The Ordnance Engineering College The Name Has Changed Four Times The Location Has Moved Three Times Now Is Heading Towards A New Life

The name "Ordnance Engineering College" has only recently appeared, and many friends may feel unfamiliar when they see it. Let me tell you, friends, it is not unfamiliar at all. Its predecessor was the Hanyang Ordnance Vocational School, founded in the sixth year of the Republic of China. At that time, it was affiliated to the Hanyang Ordnance Factory, but it was suspended due to lack of funds. It was not until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China that it was transferred to the National Government before it reopened and recruited new students. It was later renamed the Ordnance Vocational School of the Ministry of Military Affairs and moved to outside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China. Later, during the War of Resistance, it moved west to Yanggong Bridge in Chongqing. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Ordnance School of the Ministry of Military Affairs. After the victory of the war, the old school buildings were insufficient, and it was temporarily moved to Wusong, Shanghai. In early October of the thirty-sixth year, it was ordered to be renamed "Ordnance Engineering College". In thirty years, the name has changed four times, and the location has moved three times. The future permanent school site will be determined at Baishui Bridge outside Zhongshan Gate in Nanjing. There, the mountains and rivers are beautiful, and the environment is pleasant. The school buildings are currently under construction and will be moved there after completion. The Ordnance Engineering College is now heading towards a new life. Originally, there were only two departments, "Weapons Manufacturing" and "Applied Chemistry", but now "Tank Manufacturing Engineering" has been added, totaling three departments. The so-called "Weapons Manufacturing" is the study of the design and manufacture of various weapons. The so-called Applied Chemistry is the study of various applied chemical industries and the manufacture and development of toxic gases. As for Tank Manufacturing Engineering, it can be understood from the literal meaning. In short, the three departments stand together and attach equal importance to them, aiming to establish a solid foundation for the training of national defense industry talents.

The equipment of the Ordnance Engineering College has always been very complete, with a physics and chemistry building, a library, a printing house, and also an armory and a practice factory for students to conduct practical research. In addition, during the summer vacation, students can also enter domestic ordnance factories to live in the factory for internships and conduct further research.

Speaking of professors, they are all famous figures in the domestic education field. For example, during the Yanggong Bridge era, Lou Guanglai, Lu Zhihong, Zhang Hongyuan, Gao Jiyu, Sun Guangyuan, Zhang Jiangshu, Zhao Guohua, Ding Guanhai, Yan Yancun, and others who taught at the school were all knowledgeable scholars. Now, under the leadership of Zhao Guohua, Hui Shichu, and others, the lineup of professors is exceptionally strong.

We deeply know the importance of national defense, and the cultivation of national defense talents cannot be perfunctory. Moreover, the study of weapons theory cannot be entered by students with better grades, so the admission standards for ordnance are high, often thousands of people take the exam, but the number of admitted is not so numerous. Therefore, the new students admitted each time are of a high degree of tidiness. In addition, the school has a beautiful environment, professors teach seriously, and the equipment is complete, which cultivates a strong research atmosphere among the students. It is expected that many friends in Chongqing often remember: approaching Yanggong Bridge and entering the Ordnance School is like stepping into a monastery, with silence all around. If you approach the library or self-study room, they are all sitting together in a crowded hall, each one focused on studying carefully. Because of this, after four or five years of hard work, the students are slowly tempered, and they can cope with the work they take on after graduation. Since the Ordnance Engineering College was opened, although a total of only 345 students have graduated, there are indeed many who are currently holding important positions in the domestic ordnance industry. To be more specific, the most difficult public-funded study abroad program of the Ministry of Education is also listed among the graduates of Ordnance, such as Zhao Guohua's Boxer Indemnity for studying in the UK in the 28th year of the Republic of China, and Xu Jiesu's public-funded study in the United States last year. There are countless others who have been sent abroad for public or private study or inspection and practice. As far as I know, 14 of the 15 graduates of the Weapons Manufacturing Department in the 28th year of the Republic of China have been to the United States. Frankly speaking, few old alumni who graduated from ordnance have not drunk seawater.

In addition, it can also be informed that during the study period, all books, instruments, and clothing used by students are provided by the school, and there are also pocket money allowances. After graduation, the Ordnance Bureau distributes them to work in various ordnance factories. Therefore, students at the school do not have to worry about food and clothing, and can study with peace of mind. They also do not have to look for work themselves after graduation, so people say that this is an "iron rice bowl".

The Ordnance Engineering College usually recruits students during the summer vacation, but this year it is in the middle of the school relocation period, so it has only recently taken recruitment measures. This time, recruitment will be conducted in ten places across the country, including Guiyang, Wuchang, Shanghai, Nanjing, Taiwan, and Guangzhou. I sincerely welcome the admitted new students to participate in the research work of the ordnance industry together.

### Seven Battles, Seven Victories: Hua Lian Decisively Defeats Da Gong; 52 to 34, a Difference of 18 Points; Overly Tense, Da Gong's Performance is Subpar

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the first cycle of the Group A Basketball League, the championship battle between Hua Lian and Da Gong last night resulted in Hua Lian leading the entire way, achieving an absolute victory with a score of 52 to 34, a total difference of 18 points. The score at halftime was 18 to 11. Hua Lian has won seven battles and seven victories, while Da Gong has already suffered two defeats, and their hopes for the championship are dashed. If there are no changes in the future, it appears that Hua Lian will continue to hold the third championship trophy.

Last night's decisive battle attracted over 6,000 spectators. The gymnasium was packed, and ticket revenue reached over 200 million yuan, an unprecedented event in the league. Military police and constables worked together to maintain order. Shanghai and Victory Radio simultaneously broadcast the battlefield situation. The first cycle has come to an end, and Da Gong's revenge must wait until next week.

Hua Lian is a Notch Better than Da Gong

Due to emotional tension, there were times when [the audience] cheered in unison for both sides. The overall competition was quite fierce. Da Gong seemed to perform abnormally. Cai Wenhua was closely guarded by Li Zhenzhong and never managed to make a single basket, only earning three points from free throws, which was a reason for Da Gong's miserable defeat last night. The use of Zhan Chen at the start is a strategic decision worth considering. Tu Wenlong and Cai Zhongqiang were relatively weak and failed to coordinate with the three main players. There were many opportunities to shoot, but there were numerous misses. Rebounds under the basket all went to Hua Lian. These were all Da Gong's weaknesses.

Hua Lian maintained the upper hand throughout and was also more composed than Da Gong. Da Li Baosongyuan was the most outstanding, and Chen Xuechong also had occasional masterpieces. Wu Chengzhang was unparalleled in rebounding under the basket. Only Ren Xiangcheng and Liu Fushen were relatively weaker. Overall, Hua Lian's talents were well-rounded, and they were indeed a notch better than Da Gong.

Following the Situation From Beginning to End

Cai Wenhua opened the scoring with a successful free throw. From the start, they were at an advantage. Hua Lian had twelve points, while Da Gong had only three from free throws. Fei Boling replaced Zhan Chen, and only then did [Cai] Wenzhang and [Tu] Wenlong show some success. As Da Li's ball left his hand, the whistle blew, and the ball went into the basket. At halftime, Hua Lian led with 18 to 11.

In the second half, Hua Lian's Ren Xiangcheng replaced Liu Fushen. Cai Wenzhang scored two consecutive baskets, bringing the score to 18 to 15. It seemed that Da Gong had a chance to turn things around, and cheers erupted. Unfortunately, they failed to seize this golden opportunity to take it a step further. Wu Chengzhang and Bao Songyuan again scored, and Da Gong still trailed by four or five points. Cai Zhongqiang was replaced by Huang Boling, and the score gap widened. At the highest point, it was 49 to 28, a difference of 21 points. Cai Wenhua fouled out for the fifth time and left the field, hastily completing the remaining game. The final result was 52 to 34.

### Pre-Selection Team Captains Perform Plainly; Narrowly Defeat Western United 4-2; Two Penalty Kicks Scored in the Second Half

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai District team participating in the World Games football pre-selections, in order to test cooperation and warm up, played a practice match against the city's Western United team at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. Although the rain from the previous night had cleared, spectators were deterred, with only about 5,000 fans attending. Western United's attacks were particularly fierce. In the first half, the pre-selection team tied 1-1. In the second half, Western United scored another goal, taking a 2-1 lead. The pre-selection team scored three goals, turning defeat into victory, with a final score of 4-2.

The World Games team's morale was lacking, and they arrived late. The match only started at 2:55 PM. Only nine players from the representative team took the field. Yan Shixin had left Shanghai, Li Yichen missed the sign-in, and Fei Chunhua arrived only after the game started. Chen Jiawan was pulled into the game first, and Chen Jianyi bravely helped, making the situation even. Only when Fei Chunhua arrived were there eleven players.

Few Highlights, Western United Active

There were few highlights throughout the game. Wu Qixiang was the most stable. Meng Yiliang marked the small yellow-haired Roberts, playing three defenders, so the midfield line and the forwards were often disconnected. Adding to this, Han Longhai failed to stand out, further making the game lifeless. Sun Jinshun's skills were still sharp, but overall, he failed to meet the audience's expectations and still needs to work hard before going to Hong Kong. Western United had plenty of energy, with slightly weaker defenders, but excellent midfielders and forwards. Tiefu Ni marked Sun Tie Tui, Roberts remained a dangerous figure, and his goal was incredibly beautiful, glancing off the goalpost before going in. F. Edwards's speed was formidable, and Grinas was also commendable. The loss of their third and fourth goals were both from penalty kicks, and are not worth discussing. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:

World Games Pre-Selection Team

Zhang Banglun, Chen Jiawan, Wu Qixiang, Qu Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Li [blank], Sun Jinshun, Han Longhai, Xia Tiguang, Fei Chunhua

Western United Team

Wen Ganno, Xu Erz, Lesbao, Hannipo, Tiefu Ni, Kapustin, Nogolov, F. Edwards, Roberts, Grinas (replaced by Salachin), Carlo Liequ

One Goal Each, Tie at Halftime

Referee: Wu Shouheng. The pre-selection team wore East China red jerseys, and Western United wore green, white, and blue jerseys. Lining up in the center circle, the pre-selection team had nine players. Gao Baozheng moved forward, taking the left wing. After the kickoff, a melee ensued. At six minutes, Sun Jinshun tried a shot in front of the goal, but it was saved by Wen Nuogan. Soon after, Long Hai did an overhead kick, but it was also unsuccessful. At fourteen minutes, Chen Jiawan entered the field in full gear, playing left back, and the pre-selection team's momentum surged. At fourteen minutes, Sun Jinshun received support from General Han and shot from close range, the ball going into the net, 1-0 to the pre-selection team. Two minutes later, Fei Chunhua arrived and joined the battle. At twenty minutes, Roberts went on a solo run, tying the score at 1-1. Halftime ended with the score tied at one goal each.

Two Penalty Kicks Missed

After halftime, the sides switched ends and the lineups remained unchanged. At six minutes, Roberts received a pass from Nogolov and scored with a powerful shot from close range, 2-1 to Western United. Frustrated, the pre-selection team concentrated their firepower, attacking fiercely on the front line. At nineteen minutes, Fei Chunhua took a corner kick from the right, and Li [blank] was in the right spot, striking with his foot and leveling the score at 2-2. Western United were unwilling to accept defeat and launched a major attack, but failed to score. At twenty-seven minutes, Salachin replaced Grinas. Two minutes later, Hannipo committed a handball in the penalty area, and Sun Jinshun took the penalty kick, successfully scoring and putting the pre-selection team back in the lead at 3-2. Afterwards, both sides were locked in a bitter struggle until one minute before the end of the game, when Xu Erz committed a handball 30 yards out. Old Sun tried his skills again, and again he was successful. Shortly afterwards, time ran out, and the pre-selection team narrowly defeated Western United 4-2.

Jiangxi Gangguang to Face Shantou Team Today; Match Tomorrow Changed to Jiaotong University

The Jiangxi Gangguang basketball team arrived in Shanghai last week, and the Basketball Committee scheduled five matches. Three matches have already been held, resulting in defeats to Green Forest, Chen You, and Topika. Today's fourth match will be against the Shantou team at 5 PM at the City Gymnasium, with tickets costing 10,000 and 20,000 yuan. Referees will be Wang Yiqiao and Yu [blank] Lu. The team's final match was originally scheduled to be against Hua Lian or Da Gong tomorrow, but at the request of the Jiaotong University basketball team, it was decided to change the match to Jiaotong University, with the consent of the Basketball Committee. The entire team will depart for Hangzhou on the 5th and return to Jiangxi Province. The trip to Nanjing was cancelled due to time constraints.

In the past three matches, the visiting team has suffered defeats due to relatively backward skills, but their performance has been improving daily. In the match against Topika the night before last, they led twice with 8-2 and 11-4. Today, facing the Shantou team, they will surely perform even better. Cai Yanxiong is returning to serve for the Shantou team today, adding to the original lineup of Ma Canxi, Chen Qingjiang, and He Lide. Victory is assured.

### Minister of Economic Affairs Meets with Reporters; Discusses Current Economic Issues; Official-Merchant Cooperation Necessary for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management; Fuel Supply Adequate After Increased Production and Transportation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs met with reporters at his residence yesterday and answered the questions raised by the reporters. The details are recorded as follows:

Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Issues: The government's goals for managing cotton yarn and cloth are twofold: first, to stabilize the prices of cotton yarn and cloth, and second, to promote the development of the [blank] industry. The management method is to implement unified purchase and unified sales, and substitute spinning and weaving. Six implementation rules have been drafted and have all been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and are awaiting promulgation and implementation. After the new method is formulated, it is bound to be implemented. The Shanghai private yarn factories, [blank] Department of Justice believes that it is difficult to implement, before the method is implemented, it is just speculation. Whether there are difficulties in implementing the method will only be known after implementation. If difficulties are encountered after implementation, the Chairman of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, Yuan, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs can be asked to consider ways to overcome the difficulties. However, the most important thing is that the fate of the yarn factories is the same as that of the government. Therefore, sincere cooperation is necessary to save the current crisis.

Raw Cotton Supply Issue: Raw cotton can be obtained from the following three sources: (A) Purchase as much raw cotton as possible from production areas across the country. (B) Exchange raw cotton for export of cotton yarn and cloth. (C) Allocate a portion from US loans to purchase raw cotton. In addition to the above three sources, plus existing cotton stocks, it is believed that the supply of raw cotton will not be a problem for half a year.

Fuel Issue: The supply of fuel to the Beijing-Shanghai area has relied heavily on coal from the Northeast. We are now actively paying attention to: (A) Accumulating 200,000 to 300,000 tons of coal in Shanghai. (B) Factories achieving self-sufficiency in coal. (C) Promoting increased coal production in various regions. From December 10th to January 20th of last year, when the supply of coal and rice from the north was disrupted, it was maintained by relying on existing stocks. In terms of increased production, the monthly output of Huainan and East China mines half a year ago was only 80,000 to 90,000 tons, but has now increased to 160,000 tons. After half a year of efforts, the coal production in the provinces of the Yangtze River basin is sufficient to meet the needs of the Yangtze River provinces themselves. However, there is a shortage of transportation, so I am trying to implement a regional self-sufficiency plan for each province. Currently, the coal reserves in Huainan, East China, and Xing coal mines total 180,000 tons, plus the adjustment and supply of Taiwanese coal, and the coal transportation from Kaiping has recently improved, so there will be no fundamental problem with fuel.

Price Issue: The government has always paid attention to the price issue. The management of cotton yarn and cloth, the establishment of the Financial Administration, the implementation of the comprehensive distribution plan, and the implementation of the procurement and ordering policy are all aimed at comprehensively stabilizing prices. The inspection of warehouses will be implemented if necessary. If there are price fluctuations before the Lunar New Year, the central government will have special measures to deal with them.

US Aid to China Issue: China's revival should first seek self-reliance. However, China has suffered eight years of war of resistance and two years of civil war. In addition to self-reliance during the revival, if we can obtain foreign aid, the revival process can be faster [blank]. Furthermore, US aid to us is also half [blank] self-help. The more aid we receive today, the lighter the burden on the United States regarding Far East issues in the future. Less aid today will mean a greater burden in the future. Objectively speaking, the total amount of US aid should be US$3 billion. US$1 billion for military aid, US$1 billion for balancing finances and currency system reform, and US$1 billion for economic reconstruction and construction. This amount can be allocated in stages according to needs and urgency.

Impressions of Hankou: The main task of my recent trip to Hankou was to inspect the affiliated institutions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the general situation in the local area. I deeply feel that the industrial situation in Hankou is no longer as prosperous as before the war. During the War of Resistance, the main industries in the rear, such as textiles, steel, etc., were all moved from Hankou. During the war, the supply of yarn, cloth, and steel to the rear was very significant. Although it is impossible to move them all back after the victory, Hubei Province is still not short of industries that can be developed. The most prominent ones are cotton spinning, steel, machinery, oil, and chemical industries. Regarding the fuel issue, Hubei Province relied on the Liuhe [blank] and Jiaozuo [blank] before the war. As a result of increased production of anthracite coal in the province, there is a surplus that can be supplied to other provinces. The general pain of the industrial and commercial circles in Hankou is threefold: (A) Unstable situation, (B) Shortage of funds, (C) Factory equipment has not been restored to its pre-war state. The government should provide assistance within its means to help solve these problems. However, I also deeply hope that the industrial and commercial circles in Hankou, in addition to focusing on agriculture and commerce, should also pay attention to the development of industry to increase the importance of Wuhan.

### Representatives of Cotton Spinning Associations from Six Districts Continue to Discuss Details

[Our Newspaper's Report] Complying with the instructions of Chairman Yuan of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, the Cotton Spinning Associations of the six districts have appointed five representatives, Liu Piji, Tong Runfu, Tang Huaru, Han Zhiming, and Bu Shihut, to continue discussing the details with Director Liu Wenteng and Director Gao Bingtai of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee today.

### Unrest in Lu and Yu; Tobacco Merchants Purchase Yunnan Tobacco

Tobacco merchants in this city mainly purchase tobacco leaves from Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. Due to the chaotic situation in Shandong, the southward transportation of Qingzhou tobacco leaves has been greatly hindered. In Henan, Xuchang has been harassed by communist bandits in recent months, resulting in the interruption of supply. As for the Anhui area, the stagnation of transportation has made it inevitable for tobacco merchants to increase costs and face various inconveniences when purchasing. For this reason, tobacco merchants have recently shifted their focus to purchasing Yunnan tobacco leaves. Many tobacco merchants have sent special personnel to Yunnan, as the situation in the southwestern provinces is stable, providing greater safety and certainty for business and travel. If the situation in Shandong, Henan, and other places does not clear up, Yunnan tobacco leaves will soon become the main source of raw materials for the cigarette industry in this city.

[Another Dispatch] American tobacco in our country has been planted in Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces, with the widest range and best results. The quality of the tobacco produced is several times better than that of local tobacco. Therefore, the domestic American tobacco produced over the years has been able to replace part of the imported American tobacco and has become an important source for our country's cigarette industry. During the War of Resistance, most of the industrial and commercial enterprises moved to the interior with the government, and the cigarette industry also actively developed in various parts of the southwest. In order to facilitate the supply of raw materials, various parts of Yunnan Province also extensively planted American tobacco. With the keen advocacy of various relevant agencies, great results have been achieved. The quality is excellent, and the output is abundant. In addition to supplying local cigarette factories, it is also sold to various parts of the country. The planting of American tobacco in Yunnan Province has become one of the major American tobacco producing areas in our country.

### Deadline for Registration of Flammable Liquid Manufacturers at the End of the Month

The police department received a letter from the city Chamber of Commerce stating that the original extension period for the registration of flammable liquid manufacturers was only one month, which was still too short, and requested that it be extended further. After consideration, the police department believes that the application registration procedure for flammable liquids is very simple and differs from the issuance of permits, which requires investigation and review. It has agreed to extend the deadline to the end of February 1937.

### On the Issue of Siamese Remittances; The Evolution and Speculation of Siamese Remittances

By Liu Zuoren

Although the amount of remittances from Siam each year is so large, due to the lack of branches of our government banks in Siam and the lack of appropriate policies for absorbing remittances, they are all remitted by private banks. In addition, the gap between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate has widened, which has intensified the trend of remittance evasion. Private banks are organized by individuals or private groups, so they naturally only seek profit. In the past, self-respecting banks were able to specialize in remittance business, but because the national currency could not escape the fate of gradual decline, they gradually turned to financial speculation. Being keen on forward exchange transactions is also a way for overseas Chinese to remit funds, but unlike remittances, which are almost 90% or more used to support families, forward exchange transactions are large amounts remitted back to the hometown to build properties or to Shantou for high-interest loans, which also contain productive operations. However, because the banks themselves only value "forward," other hot money also joins the battle, forming financial speculation. "Shorting" becomes a trend. As long as the forward bill is cheap, everyone is happy to take action, regardless of credit. Therefore, the crisis is bred in this situation.

The so-called forward exchange transaction means receiving a certain amount of Siamese baht in Siam and stipulating that a certain amount of national currency will be delivered in Shantou within ten days. For example, the average forward price in January was 42 baht per 10,000 yuan of national currency, which means that paying 42 baht in Siam can receive 10,000 yuan of national currency in Shantou. Because the forward price is gradually decreasing, it has stimulated the speculative psychology of the general banks, and the market vision has also focused on this one industry. The general psychology is "every receipt will make a profit, even a blind man can place an order," and there is no need for any expertise or insight. Therefore, Zhang San and Li Si come to organize silver credit bureaus and exchange shops, all boasting "credit guarantees" or "fast remittances." The price does not need to know the market, anyway, the outlook is bearish.

Especially in late June of last year, it was the peak period of forward exchange transactions. At that time, the Ocean Shipping Company had the largest trading volume, and the price was often ahead of the general private exchange industry, thinking it was the secret to absorption. For example, in late June, the settlement price of the forward exchange of the private exchange industry was 4.50 to 4.60 baht, while the Ocean Shipping Company only received 4.00 to 4.25 baht. Therefore, at that time, the forward orders released by the company were mostly interbank bills. The general banks absorbed a large amount from the Ocean Shipping Company or other second-rate brands, and then transferred and released them, deducting a small profit. This is tantamount to using its own reputation as a gambling stake, bearing the responsibility for all "fire." The unlimited short-selling of the Ocean Shipping Company and other short-sellers used to be successful for a period of time, but because after Weitmeyer arrived in China on July 22, the US dollar in Shanghai quickly fell, and the Siamese Shantou exchange rate gradually rose. The Shantou exchange rate immediately rebounded to above 6 baht, so the sellers were desperate. The Ocean Shipping Company and others went bankrupt one after another, with a total amount of about 40 billion yuan, of which the Ocean Shipping Company alone reached more than 20 billion yuan, equivalent to about 20 million baht, accounting for almost one-twentieth of the total Siamese remittances.

Therefore, it can be said that the unprecedented unfortunate collapse of Siamese remittances last year was actually due to the self-destruction of Siamese banks, using blind price cuts as a competitive means, which resulted in a dangerous result. It is a lesson worth our vigilance.

Ways to Fight for Siamese Remittances

In summary, it can be seen that although the remittances from Siam are huge, the lack of correct and appropriate policies for remittances has led to the inflow of remittances into the black market, and the inflow of remittances into speculation has caused the collapse, which has caused direct damage to overseas Chinese and affected the absorption of remittances in the future. Therefore, appropriate improvements must be made in response to the current situation. The main problems that need to be improved urgently are the following:

First: Get as close as possible to the black market exchange rate to eliminate the difference between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate, so that remittances will not be evaded into the black market due to the huge losses caused by the official exchange rate. The level of the exchange rate is closely related to the country's financial policy and monetary system. Although this is a matter of the country's entire economic, financial, and monetary policy, because of the existence of the black market, the government seems to have to take into account the interests of overseas Chinese, that is, the amount of national currency collected and exchanged from overseas Chinese should be converted at the market price as much as possible. Otherwise, the profit will inevitably lead to remittances evading Hong Kong. If the list price cannot be changed arbitrarily, a subsidy policy should also be adopted, and the amount of the subsidy should be increased at any time to approach or not be lower than the black market exchange rate.

Second: Widely establish remittance absorption agencies and strengthen contact with remittance bureaus. Because the overseas Chinese residing in Siam, unlike the overseas Chinese in North and South America, are concentrated in big cities, but are scattered in various rural areas and small towns, branches of national banks should be established not only in large cities in Siam such as Bangkok, but also in other important cities such as Chiang Mai and Hepu. In four or five cities, establish national banking institutions to universally absorb remittances. In order to fully grasp all remittances, so as to prevent remittances from flowing into the black market and the [blank] calculation of the machine, it is still necessary to closely contact the remittance bureaus in various parts of Siam. The method is that all remittances received by the bureau are remitted by our banks at the black market exchange rate, or transferred to Hong Kong by the bank. In this way, all foreign exchange can fall into the hands of our banks. Not only can the government control the remittances, but also because the remittances will not flow into the black market, it will reduce the adverse effects of the black market foreign exchange on the country's economy and finance.

Third: For institutions that absorb remittances abroad, they should be widely established. In the hometowns of overseas Chinese in China, such as Shantou and Haikou, remittance agencies should also be added, and cash should be prepared as much as possible, so that overseas Chinese can obtain cash on the spot without having to find a guarantor and fail to obtain cash. And to provide various services to overseas Chinese, such as writing letters, transmitting news, designing, answering questions, and small loans to overseas Chinese families, so as to connect with overseas Chinese, remittances will inevitably increase day by day.

### Central Trust Bureau Announces Recent Tung Oil and Bristle Market Conditions: Bristle Prices Stable, Tung Oil Prices Suppressed

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Trust Bureau announced yesterday the tung oil and bristle market conditions from January 26th to the [blank] day as follows:

Tung Oil: Due to the announcement of new warehousing rules in New York and the US government's investigation into China's dumping of tung oil in the US, the foreign market price was affected. US buyers have hesitated because the US government's investigation may result in tariffs. The New York spot price has fallen from US$0.2575 per pound to US$0.25. On the other hand, domestic cargo owners are eager to sell due to the need for capital turnover, and prices have also been suppressed. Currently, loose oil CIF New York is only US$0.2425 per [blank], and barrel oil CIF London is GBP 182.5 per long ton, with very few transactions. Domestic oil prices: In Shanghai, due to tight credit, although the US exchange rate has increased by 6,000 yuan, it is still stuck at around 2.95 million yuan per city dan. Chongqing: 1,975,000 yuan. Hankou: 2,800,000 yuan. Wanxian: 2,010,000 yuan. [Blank] Zhou: 2,6000,000 yuan. Guangzhou: 2,975,000 yuan.

Bristles: This week, foreign bristle prices are still [blank]. Chongqing No. 27 black mixed bristles CIF New York is US$2.20 per pound, London is 14 shillings and 6 pence. Han No. 17 black mixed bristles CIF New York is US$3.2 per pound, Shanghai bristles are 2.20 yuan, and Tianjin small No. 55 black mixed bristles are 5.05 yuan. There have been slight transactions. Domestic prices: Chongqing bristles are 38 million yuan per [blank] dan. Hankou bristles are 50.5 million yuan. Shanghai bristles are 40 million yuan. Tianjin small No. 55 bristles are 81.5 million yuan.

### Direct Tax Bureau Urges Payment of Income Tax for Qian Industry

[Report from our newspaper] The Ministry of Finance had previously set the deadline for reporting the special business income tax for the second half of the 36th year of the Republic of China for the city's silver, money, and trust industries to be the end of January of this year. It is now reported that some firms in the industry have not yet submitted their reports completely. Therefore, a responsible person from the Direct Tax Bureau recently contacted the Bankers Association, hoping they would urge their members to report as soon as possible to facilitate collection. It is said that the industry association has already notified its members accordingly.

### Revision of Internal Exchange Rate

[Report from our newspaper] The internal exchange rates for the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be adjusted separately from February 2nd as follows: Quanzhou, Fujian, 140 yuan (originally 120 yuan). Guangzhou, 50 yuan (originally 70 yuan). Hankou-Wuchang, 30 yuan (originally 50 yuan). Shashi-Yichang, 60 yuan (originally 100 yuan). Jiujiang, 30 yuan (originally 40 yuan). Ji'an, 40 yuan (originally 50 yuan). Ganzhou, 50 yuan (originally 60 yuan). Wenzhou, 60 yuan (originally 70 yuan). Chongqing-Chengdu, 10 yuan (originally 5 yuan). Yunnan, 8 yuan (originally 2 yuan).

### Review of Manufacturers' Finished Products for Purchase Begins Today

The national banks and bureaus, under orders to purchase finished products from manufacturers, have begun accepting applications. Many have been obtaining application forms and inquiring about procedures in recent days. Dozens of firms, including cotton textile businesses, have formally submitted applications. After initial review by each bank and bureau, the applications will be forwarded to the Shanghai branch of the Joint Board of Four Banks for final review and decision. Then, the bank or bureau handling the purchase will issue a check from the Central Bank as payment. It is reported that the Shanghai branch of the Joint Board of Four Banks will begin reviewing the first batch of application forms today, aiming to purchase some finished products before the Lunar New Year to alleviate the financial difficulties of manufacturers. The Joint Board of Four Banks has specially dispatched the head of the loan department, Mr. Qiang, to Shanghai to assist in the process.

### The Contributions of Atomic Energy in Peacetime

— Translated by Qu Sou

While the issue of international atomic energy control remains unresolved, many have discussed the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. This article, written by Waccemar Kaempffert, the renowned science editor of the New York Times, provides a detailed review of the contributions and potential uses of atomic energy in peacetime. The original article was published in the October issue of Survey Graphic magazine. - Translator

It has been over two years since the atomic bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The immense power of the atomic bombs astonished not only the general public but also the scientists who created them. Humanity, with its boundless capabilities, had finally reached the point of releasing atomic energy. Imaginative individuals predicted that vehicles on roads and airplanes in the sky would soon be powered by atomic energy, and that entire cities could obtain their power from a pound or two of uranium. It seemed as though a utopian world powered by atomic energy was just around the corner, where humanity would no longer be concerned about fuel prices and could use extremely cheap atomic energy.

However, the prices of various fuels in the market have not plummeted as a result, and many power plants are instead ordering new steam boilers and generators to replace their old machines. One might ask, what is going on?

What is the extent of atomic energy's contribution to peaceful applications? Will the use of atomic energy trigger another industrial revolution for humanity? This is a question many are eager to know. From the perspective of most mechanical engineers, factories using atomic energy in large cities could serve as regular factories, or be used to generate power in areas where fuel is particularly scarce and expensive, but they are not likely to replace coal and oil altogether. This is because modern coal-burning machines used in factories today have already achieved very high efficiency, requiring only an average of one pound of coal to generate one horsepower per hour. Therefore, in many large cities in the United States, it costs only three to five cents (USD) to use one kilowatt-hour of electricity. In reality, the fuel needed for a power plant to produce one kilowatt-hour of electricity costs only two to five tenths of a cent (USD) at most. The majority of other expenses are related to electricity transmission, company management, meter reading, accounting, and other items. These expenses cannot be avoided even in the age of atomic energy. Therefore, any new raw material that can generate power must compete within the five-tenth-of-a-cent (USD) range of fuel costs to compete with coal and oil. In areas where hydroelectric power is used, atomic energy is even less viable, because the water provided by nature does not cost a single cent and is inexhaustible. Meanwhile, pure "Uranium-238" costs at least twenty dollars a pound, and the rare "Uranium-235," used to make atomic bombs, costs at least seven thousand dollars a pound, or even over ten thousand dollars a pound. Some optimistic proponents of atomic energy argue that although the price of uranium is high, one pound of pure Uranium-235, about the size of a golf ball, can produce the equivalent energy of 1,500 tons of coal, 250,000 gallons of gasoline, 80 million cubic feet of coal gas, or 400 million cubic feet of natural gas. However, even with this calculation, the benefits are minimal.

People who do not understand the principles of atomic energy often think that we can easily use atomic energy directly to provide electricity and heat to homes. In reality, this is as difficult as trying to power a train with lightning. Let's briefly describe the principle of using atomic energy before mentioning its difficulties.

The atoms of rare Uranium-235 must be bombarded by neutrons to split, and after splitting, more neutrons are released, bombarding other atoms of Uranium-235 and Uranium-238. Uranium-235 splits after being bombarded, while Uranium-238 gains neutrons and becomes Plutonium, which can be used as an explosive or as a source of electricity in power plants. The heat generated by this chain reaction is based on the same principle as the heat generated by constantly hammering a piece of iron. In the atomic bomb factory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, this heat is simply released into the air. Another atomic bomb factory in Hanford, Washington, releases the heat into the Columbia River, increasing the river's temperature by only a small amount, but the heat is still astonishing. Many American mechanical engineers have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with this massive waste. The U.S. Department of War has expressed great regret about this, as they focused all their efforts on manufacturing atomic bombs during the war and did not consider this aspect. Currently, an aircraft parts factory in Oak Ridge is experimenting with using the heat released during atomic bombardment. Until official reports and required costs are published, all statements made by scientists about using atomic energy to generate power are merely speculations, many of which are overly imaginative.

If we could directly channel the heat released during atomic bombardment to steam turbines, or use it to heat water and generate steam to power machines, then the boiler equipment in our power plants would naturally be different from what it is today. However, everything else outside the boiler room would remain the same. Our transmission lines, substations, meters, lights, streetcars, and various electrical appliances would not need to be changed. Therefore, the first thing we can be certain of is that our lifestyles and other social elements will not change after using atomic energy, and it will not create a social revolution.

In terms of economics, according to surveys and statistics from the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, it would currently cost 25 million USD to build an atomic power plant with a generating capacity of 75,000 kilowatts in the eastern United States. Building a coal-fired power plant with the same capacity in the same location would cost at most 10 million USD. Furthermore, the uranium used in the atomic power plant would also require a large capital investment, perhaps several million USD.

This comparison by the Atomic Energy Commission does not yet include all the technical difficulties in using atomic energy to generate electricity. The most important of these is the issue of radioactivity. We all know that the rays emitted by X-rays have great power, and humans cannot be directly exposed to them. However, the radiation emitted by a "uranium pile"—a square arrangement of uranium rods placed in graphite—used in atomic power generation is even more unimaginably powerful. Therefore, even the smallest atomic power plant would need a furnace with five-foot-thick walls made of fifty tons of steel and concrete. No one can approach this "pile" while it is in operation, and used rods must be removed and replaced with new ones using remote control methods. This work has been done very carefully in the atomic bomb factories in Oak Ridge and Hanford, so no one has been injured so far. However, doing this in every ordinary atomic power plant is another matter.

In addition to this, there are many other problems that need to be solved, and huge capital investments must be made for research. The most important thing is to prevent the radiation from affecting the water that needs to be heated. When using atomic energy as fuel for heating, a liquid is passed through a pipe that is heated by the high heat produced by atomic fission. This pipe must be made of a suitable material of appropriate thickness and must be absolutely leak-proof. If even a trace of water vapor leaks from the pipe, the danger is unimaginable. The atomic bombs that exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed many Japanese people, many of whom were not directly killed by the blast but died from exposure to radioactive rays, which destroyed their white blood cells and caused blood to seep out from under their skin. Therefore, working in a factory that uses atomic energy is very dangerous without extremely careful control and inspection. Water contaminated by radioactive rays cannot be discharged into ordinary waterways, otherwise the entire river will be affected. Even a rat killed by radiation cannot be buried immediately. If it is buried in the soil, it will affect the soil. If, unfortunately, other animals dig up the rat after loosening the soil, the danger is even greater.

In short, the problem of defending against radiation must first be solved before humanity can utilize atomic energy. It is because of this problem that our ideal of cars and airplanes powered by atomic energy is difficult to realize. Only in large ocean liners can uranium be used advantageously as a power source, because a large boiler weighing fifty tons can be installed on a large ocean liner without adverse effects. If a ship were to use uranium as fuel, it could travel millions of miles after being loaded once, without needing to refuel. Therefore, the space used to store oil or coal could be used for other purposes. Therefore, the use of atomic energy is extremely beneficial for naval architects, who can install larger turbines on ships to achieve higher speeds and install thicker armor on warships. The United Kingdom and the United States are now considering building large warships powered by atomic energy. If the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission allows it, shipping companies operating in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans will also plan to build faster atomic-powered ocean liners than the Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary of today.

### Sex Determination of Offspring from Single-Female Reproduction

— Xie Yeying

(I) Introduction

In organisms with sexual differentiation, fertilization seems to be a necessary condition for producing offspring. If a mature egg does not have the opportunity to be fertilized, it inevitably withers and disappears. While this is generally the case, it is not absolute. In plants and animals, there are some species whose eggs can produce offspring without fertilization. This reproductive method is biologically termed parthenogenesis, also known as virgin birth. Specifically, parthenogenesis is a type of sexual reproduction in which eggs develop without being fertilized. (Parthenogenesis in a mode of sexual reproduction in which ova develop without leinge ferilixed) Although this development is asexual, it actually originates from the female reproductive cells of sexually differentiated organisms. Therefore, it cannot be confused with asexual reproduction.

Many examples of parthenogenesis have been found in both animals and plants. In plants, these include water molds (Saprolegniae), stoneworts (Cnara), ferns, wintersweet, dandelion, sow thistle, Datura of the Solanaceae family, tobacco, and wheat of the Gramineae family. In animals, it is even more common, such as rotifers, water fleas of the Cladocera order, honeybees, aphids, stick insects, etc. Upon closer observation, the conditions of parthenogenesis in various animals and plants are actually very complex. In animals, parthenogenesis can be broadly divided into two categories:

True parthenogenesis: The eggs that undergo parthenogenesis either undergo meiosis, resulting in a haploid chromosome number (e.g., honeybees, scale insects), or do not undergo meiosis, resulting in a diploid chromosome number (e.g., armored scale insects, stick insects, rotifers, water fleas).

False parthenogenesis: This is a sham form of parthenogenesis. Although the egg is not fertilized, the egg nucleus often fuses with the nucleus of another cell (e.g., a polar body) before it begins to divide. Alternatively, the egg nucleus divides into two and then fuses back together.

In plants, parthenogenesis can be broadly divided into three categories:

Parthenogenesis: The egg develops into a sporophyte plant without fertilization, as seen in Datura, tobacco, sow thistle, etc. In this category, the egg may undergo meiosis, resulting in a haploid chromosome number, or not undergo meiosis, resulting in a diploid chromosome number.

Apogamy: Cells other than the egg cell, such as synergid cells or antipodal cells, can sometimes form an embryo without fusing with other cells, as is often seen in ferns and clubmosses.

Apospory: Cells other than spores develop into prothallia with archegonia and antheridia, as is commonly seen in mosses and ferns.

Strictly speaking, parthenogenesis should be limited to cases where the egg can develop into offspring independently without fertilization. Needless to say, animal false parthenogenesis and plant apogamy and apospory are not within the scope of the discussion in this article. Moreover, in plants, the sporophyte generation (asexual generation) is not a suitable model for explaining the sex determination of parthenogenetically produced offspring. Therefore, we must focus on the animal aspect of the discussion, which should be stated beforehand.

Today, we not only know that some species in the animal kingdom naturally reproduce through parthenogenesis (Note 1), but also, through the actual research of many biologists, we have discovered that unfertilized eggs can be induced to undergo parthenogenesis using artificial methods and physical and chemical stimuli. The former is called natural parthenogenesis, and the latter is called artificial parthenogenesis. Natural parthenogenesis is commonly seen in field mites and insects of the Arthropoda phylum, and rotifers of the Rotifera phylum. In echinoderms, annelids, and other animals, artificial methods can be used to induce the development of eggs (Note 2), but the results are not as good as those of natural parthenogenesis.

Do offspring produced through parthenogenesis have sexual differentiation? Are they male or female? What are the reasons for the formation of female or male offspring? These are the questions that will be discussed in detail below.

(II) Natural Parthenogenesis and the Sex of Offspring

Offspring produced through natural parthenogenesis exhibit sexual differentiation, but the sex of these offspring always varies depending on the animal species. Some species can only produce male offspring, some can only produce female offspring, and some can produce both female and male offspring. Therefore, based on the sex of the offspring produced, parthenogenesis can be divided into three categories:

Arrhenotoky: The offspring produced are all male, such as honeybees, ants, and wasps.

Thelytoky: The offspring produced are all female, such as armored scale insects, stick insects, Solenobia, Bcelloicesi among rotifers, and Cimbax connata and Cimbax ovata among sawflies.

Deuterotoky: The offspring produced can be either male or female, such as gall wasps, aphids, water fleas, and rotifers.

Why do some species produce male offspring, some produce female offspring, and some produce both male and female offspring as a result of the independent development of unfertilized eggs? This is not only a question of developmental biology but also a question of cytology and genetics. We must not only find the factual basis for them in developmental biology but also delve into the causes in cytology and genetics. (To be continued)

### Soundless Sound

— Sun Jialin

Sound in our minds is nothing more than beautiful singing, pleasant conversations, heroic bugle calls, and noisy market sounds... However, scientists say that sound can be used to kill germs, sterilize, dissipate smoke and fog, explore submarines, promote chemical changes, and replace surgery. It's truly incredible!

Supersonic Waves

Originally, sound is simply the vibration of objects. Human ears can perceive vibrations from sixteen to sixteen thousand times per second. Sounds exceeding this limit are inaudible. However, animals like bats and pigeons have higher perceptual functions, and they can hear some sounds that we cannot hear.

By using electric current or magnetism to vibrate quartz crystals, we can produce these vibrations of more than sixteen thousand times per second, which are called supersonic waves.

Deathly Sound

Dr. Mantner is a famous expert in supersonic waves. The doctor used a wave-quartz oscillator to generate sound waves vibrating at ten million times per second, which were focused and emitted through a parabolic mirror, reaching a rabbit cage 150 yards away. After five seconds, the rabbit was completely paralyzed and lost all sensation.

Sterilization experiments at the University of California found that streptococci are easily killed by supersonic waves. Therefore, milk that originally needed to be heated for half an hour to sterilize only needs to be exposed to supersonic waves for a few seconds to be completely sterilized.

Exploring Submarines

As early as twenty years ago, the doctor had already installed the first exploration instrument on a French submarine, using the reflection of supersonic waves to detect reefs, enemy ships, and oil rocks. The radar invented during this war is completely based on the same principle, except that it uses radio waves instead of supersonic waves.

The metal thickness gauge recently produced in the United States can measure the thickness and hardness of a metal plate from one side (the other side cannot be seen or touched) simply and conveniently, like X-ray magic. It is quite useful in the manufacturing and inspection of metal products, machinery, and boilers. This thickness gauge (Sonigage) is also a use of supersonic waves.

Clearing Clouds and Fog

When air is vibrated by supersonic waves, fine particles of dust and moisture are stimulated and gather together, condensing into large particles, and finally smoke dissipates and fog disperses. Therefore, airports and industrial areas can install supersonic wave machines on roofs on a large scale to drive away thick fog and purify the air, ensuring the safety of navigation and the health of residents.

Removing Brain Tumors

According to a report from the Columbia University Research Laboratory, germs of typhoid fever, colds, and polio can be killed by supersonic waves and then used as vaccines for inoculation. Hormones that do not dissolve in water can be made into emulsions using the vibration of supersonic waves and then injected into the human body to exert their medicinal power. A promising point is that supersonic waves can replace surgery to remove brain tumors. After determining the location, two sound waves can be crossed and directed onto the tumor, which may eliminate the cancer cells or limit their activity. If the experiment is successful, the contribution of supersonic waves will become increasingly significant.

Scientific Discussion

### Supplementary Opinions on Digital Segmentation

— Huang Baihong

In the 23rd issue of this publication, Mr. Kong Fanqing discussed the issue of digital segmentation, and he raised questions about Mr. Zhou Shimin's article on the Sinicization of digital segmentation in the 21st issue. I have not seen Mr. Zhou's article in the 21st issue, but I agree with Mr. Kong's proposal.

In fact, three-digit segmentation has become a global convention. Now all academic systems tend towards internationalization. What is already popular in various countries should be adopted by us, and we cannot and should not be different from others. This is the same as adopting the Gregorian calendar, changing weights and measures to the metric system, adding punctuation marks to official documents, and consistently using Arabic numerals 12345... This is not Westernization, but seeking our own convenience. However, there are points that Mr. Kong has not clarified, and I would like to supplement them:

According to Western numbering methods, the common highest unit is "thousand" (the fourth digit), while in Chinese folklore, the common highest unit is "ten thousand" (the fifth digit). (Western methods only have ten thousand, but no ten thousand.) Therefore, they always use three-digit segmentation, while in China, it seems that four-digit segmentation should be more reasonable (perhaps this is what Mr. Zhou saw). However, after checking various domestic books, newspapers, and forms, the arrangement of numbers is "mostly according to three-digit segmentation. As a result, the notation and the pronunciation are inconsistent. Every time one sees a number, one must silently count one-ten-hundred-thousand to pronounce it, which really loses the meaning of segmentation. Since three-digit segmentation has already been adopted in fact, then it is necessary to change the commonly used highest unit to the upper digit of three digits (the fourth digit) or the upper digit of the multiple of three digits (the seventh digit). However, canceling ten thousand (the fifth digit) does not conform to Chinese customs, so we can only rise to hundred million, trillion, and trillion is the seventh digit, so we will promote trillion as the commonly used highest unit. At the same time, we must determine that ten thousand, hundred million, and trillion are decimal, that is, ten ten thousands are one hundred million, and ten hundred millions are one trillion. For example, four hundred and fifty million compatriots should be renamed four hundred and fifty trillion compatriots, and Shanghai's three million and five hundred thousand population should be called three trillion and five hundred million population. Wouldn't this be simpler? If three-digit segmentation is done in this way, the first section starts with the ones digit, the second section starts with the thousands digit, and the third section starts with the trillion digit. You can call it out at a glance without having to silently count digit by digit. Isn't this a solution to all problems?

As for digits above the trillion, because they are not commonly used units, if we still adopt a decimal system, there will be too many names and it will be difficult to remember. Therefore, we should still use the internationally accepted thousand system, that is, every thousand digits start a new naming, such as ten trillion, hundred trillion, quadrillion, ten quadrillion, hundred quadrillion, quintillion, etc. This is naturally still consistent with the three-digit segmentation system.

I published an article entitled "My Views on Arithmetic Naming and Segmentation" in the sixth issue of the first volume of World Monthly, and also published an article entitled "Handling Hundred Millions and Trillions" in the New People's Evening News on November 17 last year, both advocating this view. I hope that domestic experts will further educate us.

### On Retreating from Office

— Yi Feng

Even a sage like Confucius did not shy away from saying, "He who excels in learning can become an official." He did not consider it shameful to seek office. No wonder that later generations of scholars, almost without exception, diligently toil through "ten years of cold window," enduring the hardship of "grinding through inkstones," hoping to realize their ambition of "learning the art of governing the world and selling it to the emperor." Thus, becoming an official has become a matter of course for scholars throughout history, and not becoming an official is an "exception."

Naturally, those who are unwilling or afraid to become officials mostly have unavoidable reasons. Especially in autocratic dynasties, the emperor held the power of life and death in his hands. Therefore, a small number of scholars who loved freedom or were not forced by poverty regarded becoming an official as a dangerous path. For example, Tao Yuanming of the Jin Dynasty was unwilling to bow for five pecks of rice and would rather go home to eat old rice, living a leisurely life of "picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence and leisurely seeing the Southern Mountain." Yan Guang of the Han Dynasty, even though his friendship and relationship with Liu Xiu were not shallow, would rather stay by the Fuchun River fishing for the rest of his life. There is also a more humorous story, as recorded in the "Hou Qing Lu," about Yang Pu, a Song Dynasty man who was unwilling to become an official:

"When Emperor Zhenzong performed the eastern sacrifice, he sought out hermits from all over the country and found Yang Pu from Qi, who could write poetry. He was summoned to an audience and claimed he could not. The emperor asked, 'Did anyone write a poem to send you off before you left?' Pu said, 'Only my wife had a poem: "Stop getting drunk and indulging in wine, and stop being wildly fond of writing poetry; today you are being taken to the government office, this time you will lose your old head." ' The emperor laughed and let him return to the mountain."

If Yang Pu considered becoming an official as losing his old head, it shows that becoming an official is something that can be done or not done. Unfortunately, those who are enthusiastic consider this a great undertaking of "honoring ancestors and brightening the family," so the number of people who think of it as "losing their old head" is even fewer, and they are worshiped by later generations as hermits with lofty character.

Today, when the country is owned by the people, officials have become the people's "public servants." Moreover, the golden age of being an official has passed. Looking at the actual lives of those poor civil servants struggling in hunger and cold, it is not difficult to know the pitiful situation of officials. However, even so, the traditional atmosphere of "he who excels in learning can become an official" does not seem to have changed much with the times. Therefore, the path of becoming an official is still a place where the majority of intellectuals compete for. In the circle of officials, there is also a great surplus of people. Those who can become officials but are unwilling or afraid to do so can naturally still be regarded as "exceptional" people. I have two friends who are unwilling or afraid to become officials:

One is a liberal arts student who originally made a living teaching. Later, he was pulled by another friend to help and once served as the district chief of a municipal city. This is an official close to the people. This brother quietly resigned in less than three months and went back to his old profession. Afterwards, when asked about the reason for his resignation, he said with great emotion: "How could I continue! Whether people know me or not, whenever they meet me, they don't ask about my political achievements or how difficult things are, but always raise their thumbs or pat my shoulder and say, 'This time, brother, you must have a way!' " This so-called "have a way" means "make a fortune." If this continues, a big tree attracts the wind. Corruption is not my forte, and not being corrupt will give me a bad name! After thinking it over, I decided to quit."

The other is a top scorer in the college entrance examination. The chairman of a certain province somehow favored him and repeatedly hinted that he should choose the best county to be a county magistrate. However, after repeated consideration, he still declined the chairman's kind "cultivation." According to him, in this era, it is still easy to control oneself from being corrupt, but it is very difficult to control others. If I do it, there will inevitably be problems!"

Based on this, the motives of my two friends for being unwilling or afraid to become officials are certainly not related to being "hermits" or seeking fame and reputation. However, their words are worth pondering. Of course, "the pure are naturally pure" and "the impure are naturally impure." A person's character and integrity are clearly defined. Moreover, there are certainly "tough guys" who "emerge from the mud without being stained." It is a pity that under the turbulent waves of the muddy current, it is not easy for the pure current to be the pillar of the river. Therefore, some people can only step back and retreat.

### Personal Experience

— Ji Shui

I remember Mr. Liang Qichao in his article "The Most Painful and the Most Joyful," the last paragraph has persuaded people to taste the cold water in winter, and how cold it is, this is the so-called "personal experience."

Only personal experience is the most real. Great sympathy is also produced in these four plain words. This time, the Shen Bao launched a "Reader Scholarship Fund" to solicit donations for poor students, and an anonymous person was deeply moved. According to him, he was deeply moved, because he personally experienced the pain of dropping out of school, so he specially sent 50 million yuan, a very considerable amount, as a "Reader Scholarship Fund." It also illustrates the great role of the four words "personal experience."

As for those guys who "take off their torn cotton-padded jackets and forget their beggar's sticks," they have different intentions and cannot be generalized.

### Unreasonable

— Wang Baili

According to Liu Nan Sui Bi: Chen Zai studied poetry with Feng Dingyuan (both from Changshu), fully received his instructions, and his learning improved day by day, but he secretly slandered Dingyuan and did not exert any more effort. Dingyuan hated him very much and complained to the local gentry. Zai gained fame because of this. Therefore, later scholars in the town who followed Dingyuan, some because their reputation had not been established, imitated Zai's story, etc. It can be seen that the customs are frivolous, and this has been the case throughout the ages. I think this kind of person is simply a mad dog. Although they can be considered "famous," their character can be seen at a glance. Originally, it is common for students to surpass their teachers, but this is due to later diligence. When drinking water, one should think of the source. You should not forget the starting point of your learning. Even if your talent can surpass your teacher, you should not slander your teacher behind their back. Zeng Shen did not enter the village of Shengmu, which can be taken as a warning. Moreover, Chen Zai's talent is ultimately not as good as Feng Dingyuan's! But if we are fair, Feng Dingyuan's efforts to correct and block him were still insufficient. This kind of kid is not worth scolding. Scolding him would only pollute your mouth. It is better to laugh it off. As the saying goes, "If you are not surprised by strange things, the strangeness will disappear." This is the same as the ancient people reading books under the lamp and suddenly seeing a ghost face, growing from small to large. The person blew out the lamp and said, "I am ashamed to compete for light with demons." But Feng Dingyuan could not bear it and complained to the local gentry, causing this kid to gain fame because of this, which gave this kid a lot of advantages.

### Talking about Covers

— Jie Ding

When I was a child, I loved to read martial arts novels. The scenes of swords and spears clashing, the methods of using skills, etc., really taught people to go to Mount Emei to learn martial arts. The skills like "Golden Bell Cover" and "Iron Shirt" written in those books are even more outstanding. People whose skills are proficient will become as solid as iron all over their bodies as long as they exert their energy. Knives and swords will bounce off their bodies, and the knives standing upright will break their edges. People with little strength will also crack their "tiger's mouth." These skills are really the best magic weapon for self-defense. As long as you have it, hey, no one will hurt me, and I can beat others at will.

There is only one thing I am not satisfied with: the authors of the novels often put a "weak spot" on the "Golden Bell Cover," either under the ribs, at the throat, or behind the neck. There is always a place where you can easily break all the "cover" skills with a light poke of your finger, and people with great skills will die immediately. A hero with "Golden Bell Cover" skills often loses his life on the "weak spot." It can be seen that the cover can never be seamless.

When I got a little older, I realized that it is the stupidest way to work hard on yourself to prevent being beaten. People who are really good at showing their skills specialize in giving covers to others, covering others. For example, ferocious beasts like tigers and lions are caught and covered with iron fences, and their power has no room to stretch. Even children can throw banana peels and chestnut shells at them across the fence. The brave can even spit at them. Covering others, of course, you will never be harmed.

Lions and tigers are still the kings of beasts after all. If you lock them up, you will forget their past ferocity. Moreover, people can only provoke them a few times from a distance, but they don't dare to really stroke the tiger's whiskers or swat the flies. The cattle and horses who are used to being slaves do not need iron cages: the horses pulling carts on the street need to wear two blinders, so that they can only look at the road in front of them from a limited gap, and they must not look around; a donkey grinding tofu and an ox pulling a waterwheel wear blinders to cover their eyes completely, so that they cannot see the ground and anything beside them, so that they can be taught to turn obediently. If their blinders are removed, what kind of world would it be! If the horse sees the bustling crowd on the side of the road, the cars roaring and passing by quickly, it will be frightened and jump up. Even if it is not panicked, the horse's eyes can freely look sideways, and it will not walk so solemnly and gracefully. If the ox turning around goes without blinders; seeing that it has been turning around all day in just that little bit of space, and has not moved a step after walking for several years, it will definitely go crazy. Moreover, constantly turning around in circles, you will see things beside you constantly shaking in front of you, and you will have to faint. Their owners certainly don't want them to violate the rules, so they have to firmly install blinders on the eyes of the cattle and horses.

The use of covers is certainly not that simple. For example, to prevent flies from disturbing, you have to use a gauze cover, a mask to resist "disease entering from the mouth," a windshield to protect from the wind, a glass cover on instruments, a face cover on noble ladies... all kinds of covers, and the usage is naturally different, and you can't finish talking about them.

Unfortunately, things are not that simple. Although covers can represent separation and discrimination, and hard covers are just like the Golden Bell Cover and the Net of Heaven and Earth mentioned by novelists, they all have the possibility of being pierced. As long as you find the "weak spot" - some covers only need to be hit lightly anywhere - all the covers will lose their effectiveness.

### After the Third World War (Part 2)

— Translated by Wu Bixi

B: You, we must not let this conflict lead to another war.

C: Don't threaten me! Do you think I'm afraid of you just because you have the only gun in the world?

A: Alright, alright, stop arguing. We are the only three left. Arguing like this makes it seem like the world is not big enough to accommodate the three of us.

B: If the world is big enough to accommodate us, then why don't you give up one Australia?

A: Oh - that's not what the world being big enough means.

C: Look, you still want me to call North America a continent!

B: I have a suggestion. Since we can't agree on the demand for land, we might as well postpone the discussion of this matter and conduct a survey first.

A: I second that.

C: Those who agree, raise your hands. Okay, that passes. I propose that we now discuss the distribution of matches.

B: These matches must be the common property of mankind. I propose that we divide them equally among the three of us.

A: This proposal is simply absurd! First, I found the matches. Why should they be the common property of mankind? Second, how can eight matches be divided equally among three people?

B: Then what is your opinion?

A: I propose to give each of you two matches, and I will take four matches and the matchbox.

C: This proposal is absolutely unacceptable. I veto it!

B: Please don't act impulsively. Discuss it slowly.

A: Alas, it is really a shameful thing to waste valuable time on meaningless debates, while neglecting the work of rebuilding the world!

C: (To B) What do you think of this? He has the matches but does not advocate debate. Don't worry, as long as you give us the matches, we will immediately start the work of rebuilding! (Pause)

A: Please forgive me... I propose to adjourn the meeting temporarily. (A walks out, B watches him, then excitedly whispers to C)

C: This is a good idea. (Picks up a wooden stick) Come on!

B: Shouldn't we give him a strongly worded note first?

C: We can give it to him afterwards. Let's give him a surprise! (B and C exit. After a while, the sound of hammering is heard, followed by angry shouts, and then A's screams as he dies. After a while, B and C return.)

C: We have eliminated the public enemy of mankind. This time we have done a great service. Okay, give me four matches!

B: Four? Why four?

C: Isn't it the fairest thing to divide the spoils in half?

B: You have no conscience at all. Who came up with the idea this time?

C: True, but I was the first to strike!

B: That's simply not a reason. There are only three matches here. Take it or leave it! (C angrily raises the wooden stick. B takes out a pistol and shoots him. C falls to the ground. B quietly sits down, takes out a cigarette, lights a match and smokes.)

C: (Dying) Heavens! Do you know what a terrible disaster you have caused!

B: Who said that? I have achieved eternal peace for all mankind!

(Curtain falls.)

### Dog and Cat

— Xin Juan

I have a special love for raising dogs. After returning to the countryside, I wanted to raise one, but I could not find a "good breed" after searching for more than a month. The countryside is full of mangy, molting wild dogs, which are not very pleasing.

Recently, I saw the movie "A Dog's Way Home" in Shanghai, and I was very moved. More than ten years ago, I saw the performance of the "dog star" Rin Tin Tin, and I still have not forgotten it.

A famous British writer said in his long article "On Dogs and Cats": "Cats are only cute in the early stages of walking after sitting down. The French say: women should be born at the age of seventeen and die at the age of thirty; cats should be born soon and die before they grow up"! Then he turned his pen and greatly praised the dog, because the writer was originally a "lover" of dogs!

Dogs are docile and loyal servants. You stroke it, and it wags its tail to show welcome and loyalty. Similarly, you stroke a cat, and it only closes its eyes and ignores you, coldly and indifferently, with very little "reaction" and affectionate expression. It seems that their souls are mysterious and unpredictable, and they can survive without relying on others. Whether they are praised or admired, they all show indifference and indifference. This is why the French regard cats as completely different from dogs in soul and spirit.

We don't need to be prejudiced against these two animals, dogs and cats. Let's take a look at the commendation of the great Frenchman Pascal: "I have seen too much of mankind, and what I like most is dogs"! There are also many texts praising dogs in literature. Byron's praise of loyal humans is also a praise of loyal dogs. The last two lines of "Epitaph to a Newfoundland Dog" say:

"To mark a friend's remains these stones arise;

I never knew but one - and here he lies." Dogs are loyal and enthusiastic companions, working for you, running for you, and even dying for you. Therefore, there are many records of heroic deeds in literary history.

What about cats? Selfish, cunning, insidious, and mysterious, just like Dr. Jekyll's dual personality of doing good during the day and evil at night. He lies quietly by the burning fireplace, curled up on the carpet like a blind witch, emitting a bewitching, treacherous, and terrifying aura!

However, the dog holds its heart in its hand, its life is like daylight, without shadows or secrets, it is such a frank and simple fellow! Cats are far away from human life, while dogs follow closely like your own shadow, never leaving for a moment, becoming an indispensable part of your life. Charles Reade criticized a person: "He is only a man, but he is as loyal as a dog." This is what he praised a hero - "he is as loyal as a dog." Look at their achievements: herding sheep, hunting, guarding doors, detecting, transmitting messages... It is a loyal friend who always serves you devoutly!

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Nine: Leaking Secrets (60)

Xiao Bai looked at it and said happily, "Good, sing it again." Yun Qing repeated "The sun is shining, the spring is beautiful, and the birds are singing happily" twice. The parrot shook its wings and jumped twice on the shelf, as if it had found where the sound was. Xiao Bai said again, "Right, sing it again." Yun Qing sang two more sentences, and the parrot really learned it, laughing non-stop. Xiao Bai said, "Don't laugh, let it finish." Yun Qing sang two more sentences, and the parrot only jumped around on the shelf and did not sing. Xiao Bai laughed and said, "This thing is so annoying. It sings when you tease it, but it doesn't sing no matter how you tease it when it doesn't want to. Now you don't need to tease it, and it won't sing anymore! Come and sit in the room." Yun Qing followed him into the room. Xiao Bai lay on the short couch, shook his foot, and pointed to the parrot outside the window and said, "I always tease it once or twice every day to be happy. Zhu Zhai used to love to tease it the most. He was the most patient. He always made it learn a few sentences before he left. Recently, Zhu Zhai has not been seen. I don't know what he is busy with all day. Have you seen him?" Yun Qing saw that Xiao Bai mentioned Zhu Zhai, which was a good opportunity. She quickly took the opportunity to say, "He is very busy. Recently, something happened. He is divorcing his wife!" Xiao Bai was surprised and said, "Why is he divorcing his wife?" Yun Qing said, "I don't know very well. According to his wife, Zhu Zhai wants to marry Gu Qiwan, so he is divorcing her." Xiao Bai said, "Zhu Zhai is too reckless. Can his old man at home agree?" Yun Qing said, "He is probably still hiding it from his old man!" Xiao Bai said, "His father will never agree." Yun Qing said, "Young people nowadays don't care so much! If they want to do it, they will use all means to achieve their goal, no matter how opposed the family is, they don't care." Xiao Bai said, "Zhu Zhai has made a big mistake. He can't marry Qiwan: Qiwan can't marry Zhu Zhai either. Wait for me to call him and ask him clearly. I want to point him out, don't go astray." Yun Qing said, "This is your good intentions, but don't mention that I said it when you talk to him." Xiao Bai said, "Why should I mention you. I want to persuade him with justice, call him back, it has many harmful effects for him to marry Qiwan, no good at all. Qiwan will regret marrying him in the future, and Zhu Zhai is a married man, how can she marry him. I didn't know about this, not to mention, since I know it, I will try to save him, so that there will be no storms in his family." As he spoke, he called the bank and asked Zhu Zhai to come. Yun Qing felt that Xiao Bai was going to call Zhu Zhai to question him immediately, and it was inconvenient for her to stay here. After talking for a while, she excused herself and left in a hurry. Not long after Yun Qing left the Fei residence, Zhu Zhai also arrived. As soon as Xiao Bai saw Zhu Zhai, he said with a face full of smiles, "Zhu Zhai, you haven't come for a long time. You are going to hold a happy event soon. I want to drink your wedding wine. Why didn't you inform me?" Zhu Zhai heard this, and his heart couldn't help but jump, he forced himself to calm down and said, "What wedding wine is uncle talking about?" Xiao Bai said, "Such a big happy event, you still want to hide it from me, who doesn't know outside that you are going to marry Qiwan soon?" Zhu Zhai said, "Who did uncle hear it from?" Xiao Bai said, "I just ask if you have this matter or not?"

### Strange Tales of Reimbursement

The writer Fuhu Le was a correspondent before he started writing. Once, he was ordered by the newspaper to go to the Canadian wilderness to inquire about the whereabouts of several missing pilots. He wanted to use the money from the fund, so what if he spent a little more; but he forgot to keep a detailed account of all the expenses.

When he returned home to report, he found that he had spent $3,000. In order to get reimbursed, he had to rely on memory and imagination. He listed all the equipment and clothes needed in the Arctic region: snowshoes, sleds, wool underwear, fur clothes, earmuffs, etc. After an hour of thinking, with painstaking effort, the total was only $2,800.

He racked his brains for another hour, and then he remembered the hunting dog he had brought to the ice field, which unfortunately died. He sent two people to get another dog to replace it - the cost was $130, no - $150. There was still $50 for which the use was not clear.

After searching his brains, Fuhu Le wrote out the final use, which was an emotional expense. The last item on the statement read: "Flowers offered in front of the dead dog - $50."

### No Place to Live, Persuading to Stay Temporarily, Refusing to Move Out After the Deadline, Extorting Huge Sums of Money

Luo Juezhen asked: I rent the front building in Lane X, News Road. In the second year of the Republic of China, there was a Mr. Zhi, who, due to lack of housing, repeatedly asked someone to plead with me to rent the pavilion room in the north. Because his words were sincere, I reluctantly lent it to him. Later, in July of the thirty-fifth year, he moved out as agreed, but requested to temporarily borrow the pavilion room to allow a relative, Mr. Yu, to handle his wedding. Because Mr. Yu and I get along very well, I also accommodated him. Now that Mr. Yu's wedding is over, he left in December of last year. However, Mr. Zhi still has some scattered items left in the pavilion room, which have not been moved away. I have repeatedly urged him, but he ignored it, and even threatened to take back the house, unless I pay three taels of gold. He is extorting and demanding, reversing his past attitude. Because I do not understand the law, I do not know how to deal with it. Please advise me.

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replied] If the house has indeed been moved out and the household registration has been reported as moved, you can ask the local Baojia chief to certify the remaining scattered items, keep them in custody on your behalf, and immediately notify him to collect them. It is not allowed by law to collect tips.

### Fang Wangxi Wrongfully Accuses Li Fengzhu

— Zheng Guoguan

The name of Neo-Confucianism originated from the Song scholars, but the differences in views between Zhu Xi and Lu Jiuyuan were difficult to eliminate. Thus, "fragmented" and "empty" became the epitomes of the academic schools of Kao Ting (Zhu Xi) and Xiangshan (Lu Jiuyuan). (Lü Donglai invited Kao Ting and Jiuyuan to meet at Goose Lake, each to prove their learning, intending to integrate and unify them, but Zhu considered Lu to be empty and Lu considered Zhu to be fragmented, and their theories ultimately failed to converge.) Since then, the only one who could establish his own banner outside of Zhu and Lu was Yan Xizhai (Yuan) of the Qing Dynasty. Among Xizhai's disciples, Li Gangzhu (Gong) was the most capable of upholding his teacher's teachings. His contribution to propagating it was immense. Fengzhu was friendly with Fang Wangxi (Bao), and Bao once ordered his son Daozhang to learn from Gangzhu, but he did not agree with Fengzhu's opposition to Cheng-Zhu. (His letters discussing learning with Gangzhu are fully recorded in Wangxi's collected works, which can be read to understand.) After Gangzhu's death, Wangxi wrote his epitaph, stating that Gangzhu ultimately changed his teacher's method in his later years due to Fang's teachings. However, reading Fengzhu's "Grievance Valley Collection," his criticism of Cheng-Zhu never wavered from beginning to end. What Wangxi said was probably out of sectarian bias and may not have been factual. Therefore, Liu Diaozan wrote the "Chronological Biography of Shugu," strongly refuting his claims, and also said that Wangxi purely fabricated falsehoods, slandering a deceased friend. His words were: "The Prime Minister planned to recruit Mr. Li, but Lingao (Fang Bao) obstructed it due to old age and illness. At that time, Mr. Li was sixty-five years old, and it was not true that Mr. Li was old and sick. Some said: Lingao was very close to Mr. Li and knew that Mr. Li would definitely not accept the offer. However, Mr. Li's lifelong ambition was to practice the Way, not to live in seclusion like Shi Yin... I observe that Lingao's relationship with Mr. Li was very close, but their scholarship did not agree. Every time they discussed learning together, Mr. Li spoke eloquently and with righteous arguments, and Lingao could not interject, so he evaded the topic to avoid confrontation. After Mr. Li's death, he wrote an epitaph for him, briefly mentioning Mr. Li's morality and scholarship, only extensively recounting the beginnings and ends of his interactions with Mr. Li and Mr. Wang Yuan. He cleverly argued: 'With Gangzhu's respect for his teacher, he readily changed his mind after hearing my words.' He certainly wanted to highlight his own learning by diminishing that of Mr. Li, how could this be the intention of a friend?" I believe that Li Gangzhu's respect for Xizhai was comparable to the seventy disciples' reverence for Confucius, and it is unbelievable that he would readily change his mind after hearing Wangxi's words. As for the statement that Fengzhu was not employed because of Wangxi's obstruction, it seems like an overinterpretation and distortion, and Wangxi should not have gone that far. Furthermore, what did Wangxi have to fear or worry about that he had to prevent him from entering officialdom? However, looking at Wangxi's life, he was indeed the one who wrote the preface to the "Nanshan Collection" in the beginning, and when Dai Mingshi was incriminated, Wangxi faced interrogation but firmly denied it. Although he was spared execution by chance, he was more ashamed than Gao Linggong (Yun). And this slander of Li Gangzhu is enough to tarnish the reputation of a great literary master of his generation (the founder of the Tongcheng School).
