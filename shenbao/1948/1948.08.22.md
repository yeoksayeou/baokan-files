### Presidential Telegram to Provincial and Municipal Governments: Strictly Punish Speculation and Hoarding; No Tolerance for Neglect of Duty

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek summoned Premier Weng Wenhao to his official residence for breakfast on the morning of the 21st. He inquired about the implementation of the emergency financial and economic measures promulgated and gave instructions. Premier Weng briefed the President on the situation as of the 21st and then departed. Premier Weng returned to the Executive Yuan, where he met with Finance Minister Wang Yunwu to inquire about everything, with particular attention to the suspension of production loans.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] In order to thoroughly implement the emergency financial and economic measures, the President telegraphed all provincial and municipal governments on the 21st, informing them of the government's determination to reform the currency system and stabilize the economy. He sternly instructed all levels of local government to fulfill their responsibilities and enforce the law. Any neglect of duty would be severely punished by the Central Government without any leniency. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Chairmen of all Provincial Governments and Mayors of all Municipal Governments: The Central Government, based on the provisions of the Provisional Articles of the Period of Mobilization and War, promulgated the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures and related regulations on the 19th of this month, which have been implemented throughout the country. This is a necessary measure to reform the currency system and stabilize the economy, the result of long-term, confidential research, carefully formulated to address the pressing needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood. Its main points should be explicitly stated: First, the issuance of the new currency, the Gold Yuan, is based on full reserves and public issuance, to permanently establish the credit of the new currency system. Second, the handling of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange assets held by the people aims to channel frozen, useless assets into legitimate industrial and commercial uses, while fully safeguarding the inherent interests of the people, without any loss whatsoever. Third, the measures to reorganize finances and strengthen economic controls are intended to actively promote balanced revenues and expenditures, stable prices, and increased production, while strictly cracking down on speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and other undesirable phenomena. It is believed that the full implementation of these measures will not only alleviate the hardships of the people but also lay the fiscal foundation for the great cause of the nation. All levels of government and the people of the entire country must be of one mind and cooperate fully to achieve the best possible results from these significant measures as quickly as possible. In particular, all levels of local government bear the responsibility for implementation and must earnestly inform the people that those who faithfully abide by the law and work together to promote the new currency system and economic stability will be fully protected by the government. Those who engage in speculation and hoarding, refuse to repent, and dare to violate the law for selfish gain are severing themselves from the nation and the people, no different from aiding traitors and bandits. Their crimes are equivalent to those of national traitors and collaborators. Regardless of the power or status they may wield, all levels of local government must act decisively, enforce the law, and severely punish them without any leniency. It is hoped that all levels of government will appreciate the needs of the time, be mindful of their responsibilities, establish achievements with determination, and break through obstacles with strength. No matter what difficulties are encountered, the Central Government will fully support them. However, if there is superficial compliance, neglect of duty, leading to a failure to implement the law, or inadequate supervision and evaluation of subordinate personnel, leading to illegal and corrupt practices that undermine the effectiveness of the law, then the responsible supervisors at all levels shall be held accountable for dereliction of duty, and the Central Government will severely punish them without any leniency. It must be understood that the Central Government's currency reform, financial reorganization, and economic controls are crucial to the prosperity and survival of the entire nation. With the wealth of our national resources and the abundance of our land, if the government personnel at all levels can recognize the spirit of the law, embrace a firm belief, proceed with the greatest determination, set an example, and strive for achievements, then the success of the new currency system and the new economy can be achieved in the shortest possible time, demonstrating the clear effect of self-reliance. Let each strive for this. Chiang Kai-shek, personally initiated.

### Economic Control Commission Immediately Established; Supervisors for Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou Announced Yesterday

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The Executive Yuan has established an Economic Control Commission to promote various measures for stabilizing the economy. The Premier of the Executive Yuan will concurrently serve as the Chairman of the Commission, and the members will include relevant individuals: Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Yu Hongjun, Zhang Lisheng, Yan Jiagan, and Chiang Ching-kuo. The Commission's organizational regulations were approved at the Provisional Political Affairs Conference on the 19th, and the Commission will be formally established and hold a meeting in the near future.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The President issued the following orders on August 21st: (1) Appoints Yu Hongjun as the Economic Control Supervisor for the Shanghai Region, with Chiang Ching-kuo assisting in the supervision. (2) Appoints Zhang Lisheng as the Economic Control Supervisor for the Tianjin Region, with Gong Fuzhou assisting in the supervision.

[Further Dispatch] To strictly implement the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, the President has ordered the permanent stationing of supervisors in the Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianjin regions, so that relevant agencies in various localities can easily report to them. Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan telegraphed the leading military and political figures responsible for the aforementioned regions, Wu Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, Fu Zuoyi, Du Jianshi, and the provincial and municipal governments, to explain the matter.

[Further Dispatch] Premier Weng telegraphed Soong Tzu-wen, Yu Hongjun, and Chiang Ching-kuo on the 21st, encouraging them in their new tasks of supervising the implementation of the emergency financial and economic measures in the Guangzhou and Shanghai regions. The full text of the telegrams is as follows:

To Yu Hongjun and Chiang Ching-kuo:

To Yu Hongjun in Shanghai, and relayed to Chiang Ching-kuo: The implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures is of utmost importance, and the Shanghai region is particularly critical as the nation's hub. I hope that you both will supervise the effective implementation in all aspects of finance and materials, in order to achieve the practical results of consolidating currency credibility and stabilizing prices. You should also establish close ties with local agencies and security organizations to jointly plan for progress. I also hope that you will report the actual situation to the Executive Yuan at any time for review.

To Chairman Soong:

To Chairman Soong Tzu-wen in Guangzhou: The implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures is of utmost importance. It is particularly important to handle matters properly in the major coastal ports. I hope that you, as the supervisor of the Guangzhou region, will adapt to local conditions and carefully plan for implementation in all matters within the region. This is what I deeply hope for.

### The Executive Yuan Telegrams Provinces and Municipalities: Diligently Stabilize Prices

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] In response to price fluctuations in some areas in recent days, the Executive Yuan telegraphed all provincial and municipal governments, urging them to strictly enforce the provision that local market prices as of August 19th must be the highest prices from now on.

### Accelerate the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises; Issue Stocks Using Marketable Securities

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] After the currency reform, the government will accelerate the sale of state-owned enterprises to replenish its issuance reserves. However, it will use marketable securities methods, issuing stocks. For example, the China Textile Corporation is estimated to be able to issue US$300 million worth of stock. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, except for a portion retained by the government, will also be sold through stock methods, which is expected to generate approximately US$100 million. The issuance of these stocks is expected to be realized in the short term. The revenue from the sale of stocks can be used as part of the government's guaranteed reserves for the issuance of Gold Yuan notes. There are other enterprises or materials to be sold, and their total value should be sufficient to serve as a full basis for guaranteed reserves. This reporter interviewed a well-connected, authoritative government source on the evening of the 21st. According to his remarks, there is indeed a fact that the issuance of Gold Yuan notes is worthy of our trust. Although some people are concerned about the high military spending, the US$125 million in dedicated military aid to China will not affect the stability of the currency system's revenue and expenditure. The authoritative source also praised the peg exchange rate with optimism, believing that it will certainly be achieved. Any deliberate violation of the law should be severely punished without any leniency. The full text of the telegram is as follows: To the Provincial and Municipal Governments: It is assumed that the telegram from Nanjing on August 19th has been complied with. The various measures stipulated in the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures must be communicated and strictly implemented, and uniformly followed. Since inflation has been stopped, the economic situation can naturally be stabilized. The measures to strengthen economic controls contain clear provisions for stabilizing prices, and special attention should be paid to the prices of essential daily necessities. You are instructed to order the responsible agencies and personnel to widely inform the public and conduct earnest inspections to achieve the practical effect of stabilization. Executive Yuan, August 21st.

### Gu Zheng-gang Hopes Shanghai Banking and Money Industries Will Cooperate in Implementing the New Currency System; The Ministry of Social Affairs Will Not Draft Separate Wage Regulations

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] Regarding the wage issue, this reporter interviewed Gu Zheng-gang, Minister of Social Affairs, on the 21st, inquiring about the Ministry's measures and the reactions from various localities since their implementation. Gu said that the workers' reactions had been good based on reports from various localities in the past two days. He also said that the workers could understand that stability in the rear made it easier for the front lines to proceed quickly. As for the implementation measures related to wages, the Ministry of Social Affairs will not draft separate regulations. Gu also specifically pointed out that banking and money industries in Shanghai must do their best to help, as this would be of great benefit to the country in the implementation of the new currency system. Gu will take a night train to Shanghai on the 21st to attend the establishment ceremony of the Industry Association and discuss matters with relevant figures in Shanghai.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The Ministry of Social Affairs has issued instructions to the social administration agencies in all provinces and municipalities to strictly enforce the relevant provisions of these measures on wage and prohibiting lockouts, strikes, and slowdowns, and that credit cooperatives should not engage in other banking and money industries. It has also ordered them to list and report to the Ministry the cost of living index for the first half of August in each locality and the wages of workers in various industries and categories for the first half of August in each locality, converted from legal tender to Gold Yuan according to the original regulations for each enterprise, as a basis for future assessment of wages in various localities.

The Ministry of Social Affairs' telegram to the social affairs bureaus in all provinces and municipalities is as follows: "Since the government implemented the suppression of the rebellion, labor unions, industrial and commercial groups at all levels, and their members have been able to faithfully follow all government measures and have made many contributions, which is deeply gratifying. Now that the government has promulgated the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, Article 23 of Section 4 on Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls, which prohibits lockouts, strikes, and slowdowns during the implementation period of these measures, is of great importance for stabilizing the production process and increasing the strength to suppress the rebellion. A special telegram is sent to urge both labor and management to understand the difficulties of the time, faithfully comply, strictly prevent the instigation of bandits and traitors, and never give them an opportunity. Pay close attention at all times and in all places. This is of utmost importance."

### Prices of State-Owned Enterprises' Products Must Not Be Increased by Discount; Electricity Price Adjustments Must Be Approved Before Implementation

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The Resources Commission telegraphed its affiliated state-owned enterprises to strictly comply with the newly promulgated measures. The sale prices of products from these units should be strictly in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the "Measures for Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls," which stipulate that prices should be converted from the local prices on August 19, 1937, to Gold Yuan according to the statutory exchange rate, and absolutely must not be increased. Any violation will result in the dismissal of the responsible supervisor and severe punishment according to law. In addition, the power plants affiliated with the Commission are state-owned public utilities. According to Article 3 of the aforementioned measures, if their fees are lower than the pre-war standard, they may be adjusted with reference to the pre-war standard in order to achieve self-sufficiency. The Commission has also telegraphed all power plants that if it is necessary to adjust with reference to the pre-war standard, they should submit detailed reasons and calculation statements to the Commission for approval before implementation. Before approval is granted, they should continue to charge electricity prices according to the August 19th price and must not change them.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] This reporter interviewed Zhang Lisheng, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, and Yu Dawei, Minister of Communications, on the 21st to inquire about the issue of price increases in transportation enterprises. Zhang expressed with certainty that prices would not increase, because although the measures stipulated that pre-war prices could be restored, it was not mandatory. Yu told us that the Ministry of Communications is currently studying whether there is a need for adjustments based on the principle of "self-sufficiency" and reviewing the amounts of revenue and expenditure. Currently, in terms of expenditures, such as wages and coal, wages are roughly the same as the average pre-war wages, but the price ratio of coal is nearly twice as high as the original price. Therefore, he has issued a notice to the affiliated units to conduct research. The Ministry of Communications will decide on the issue of price increases after collecting reports from all parties, but Yu's attitude was extremely cautious, and he repeatedly stated that further research was necessary. Article 23 states that during the implementation period of these measures, the prohibition of lockouts, strikes, and slowdowns is of great importance for stabilizing the production process and increasing the strength to suppress the rebellion. A special telegram is sent to urge both labor and management to understand the difficulties of the time, faithfully comply, strictly prevent the instigation of bandits and traitors, and never give them an opportunity. Pay close attention at all times and in all places. This is of utmost importance.

The following is the text of Zhang's speech at the airport:

"My visit to Japan this time is purely in a private capacity to make an observation tour, and it does not contain any representative significance and I do not bear any specific tasks. I returned to China from the United States in 1945 for medical treatment and passed through Japan. I received generous hospitality from General MacArthur. Unfortunately, I had to return to China urgently, and I stayed in Japan for a total of three days. I have wanted to come again for a long time, but I was bound by my duties, and only today did I achieve this wish. The progress of Japan's peaceful and democratic construction after the war is the guarantee of Japan's national restoration and the basis for the permanent cooperative relationship between Japan and China and other countries in the world. Every person who cares about Japan and the overall situation in the world has the same feeling. I am here today with these common feelings and expectations. I am very grateful to General MacArthur of the Allied Headquarters for his kindness, which has facilitated this trip. Journalists may wish me to express some opinions, but since this trip is an observation tour, I will focus on listening and learning. Before obtaining a reasonably mature result of my observation, I have no opinion to express, and I hope you will understand."

Editorial

### Celebrating the Establishment of the Municipal Industrial Association

The Industrial Association Law was passed by the Legislative Yuan on October 7th of last year and promulgated for implementation by the National Government on the 27th of the same month. In March of this year, the Ministry of Social Affairs drafted implementing regulations, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. Thus, the legislative procedures for the Industrial Association were fully completed.

The Ministry of Social Affairs considers this city to be the industrial center of our country, and it is necessary to complete this organization as soon as possible to enhance unity. Therefore, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs was instructed to be responsible for guiding the major trade associations and the industrial trade associations under the city to reorganize according to the new law and then prepare for the establishment of the Municipal Industrial Association. After four months of preparation, all preparatory procedures have been completed, and the inaugural meeting will be held today. The Ministers of Social Affairs and Industry and Commerce, as well as the heads of various departments in the city, will attend to provide guidance. It is reported that 73 units have applied to join the association, and the preparatory committee has received many proposals, some concerning industrial policies and others concerning labor-management issues. This is not only a pioneering event in the industrial and commercial organization of this city but also marks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of China's industrial sector.

Since the late Qing Dynasty, the people's organization with the longest history and the most solid foundation has been the Chamber of Commerce. Most businesses engaged in manufacturing, selling, transporting, and financing participate according to the law, making it a leader in the industrial and commercial circles of various places. According to the current Chamber of Commerce Law, its constituent members are divided into three categories: commercial trade associations, public service trade associations, and import and export trade associations. The promulgation of the Industrial Association Law and the simultaneous repeal of the Industrial Trade Association Law indicate that the development of industry today has reached a considerable level of maturity and should be organized independently to smoothly promote its responsibilities. This is not only a significant advancement in organization but also a symbol of the development of industry itself.

In this period of economic turmoil, the industrial environment is worse than that of other industries. After the establishment of the Industrial Association, its passive tasks of patching up and supporting with difficulty will likely be more urgent than actively undertaking work. However, we believe that this extraordinary phenomenon is only a temporary scene in the transition period. Once the situation improves and the economy stabilizes, the great mission borne by the industrial sector will be completed by the Industrial Association's mediation and leadership.

Regarding the newly implemented currency system, knowledgeable people believe that whether the currency value can be consolidated depends on the stability of prices, and whether prices can be stabilized depends on whether production can be increased. Therefore, the future of the Industrial Association is not only a problem for the industrial sector itself but also a problem concerning the entire national economy and the people's livelihood.

As for the original Chamber of Commerce, after the establishment of the Industrial Association, various industrial associations have been reorganized and transferred, and their duties seem to be easier than before, but their strength will not be weakened as a result. Because industry and commerce are inherently integrated, and there is no conflict of interest, and the wholesale departments, sales departments, and retail departments set up by factories are all commercial in nature, and they must still join the respective commercial associations according to law and remain a part of the Chamber of Commerce. Moreover, the membership qualifications of the Industrial Association are quite strict. According to the draft Factory Law, it is necessary to have machines in operation and regularly employ 30 or more workers, or not have machines in operation and regularly employ 60 or more workers. Small factories that do not meet the above conditions must form commercial trade associations and join the Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, most members of the Industrial Association must still join the Chamber of Commerce as members. The only difference is that a factory often has dual membership. The coordination of various internal matters and the negotiation of various external issues will not be hindered by the emergence of the new organization. On the contrary, the establishment of the Industrial Association has strengthened its momentum, which may be one of the main reasons why everyone welcomes the Industrial Association. In short, the Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association will be like two wheels of a cart and two wings of a bird. In this autumn of economic instability, we hope that they will work together to overcome all the difficulties. The Municipal Industrial Association was born this morning, and we are happy to celebrate its birth and wish our country's industry a limitless future.

### Interrogating Students Suspected of Being Communist Spies in Various Schools is Legally Unobjectionable; People in Academic Circles in Nanjing Express Their Opinions

[Reported by the Central News Agency from Nanjing on the 21st] The government has taken the necessary measures and has begun to eliminate the communist spies lurking in schools in the rear. The reporter interviewed people in academic circles to solicit their opinions. Professor Yang Youjiong said: Since the Special Criminal Court has been established, it is its duty to interrogate students suspected of being communist spies. From a legal point of view, it is unobjectionable. It would be best if the education authorities could also carry out a fundamental task at the same time, namely, the training and guidance of political thought. Professor Chen Guyuan said: At this moment, we really cannot condone students suspected of being communist spies. If no action is taken, the schools will be more chaotic next semester, and professors will not be able to teach. I believe that if necessary, it is perfectly legal and reasonable for the government to send military police to schools to arrest students suspected of being communist spies, because the military police have judicial responsibilities. Rui Yifu also agreed with the government's move and advocated that students should abide by the law and be summoned to court. If the evidence of guilt is true, they should be punished by law. If not, they can have the opportunity to defend themselves and dispel suspicion. The reporter then visited Sa Bendong, the director of the Physics Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, to inquire about his opinions on this matter. Sa Bendong believes that the government's interrogation of communist spies lurking in various schools according to law this time is a reasonable move. Since the government is handling this matter impartially and is holding a cautious attitude, he hopes that it can be dealt with quickly. Those with conclusive evidence should be judged according to law, and the innocent should be released as soon as possible to reassure the people. He said: "I am a researcher of natural science and know the importance of natural law in the natural world. The same is true for the law to the country and society. Under the national law, we have the obligation to respect and abide by the law."

### Jiangsu Province's Conscription Quota Not Reduced; 3,600 People in the Second Phase Must Be Conscripted as Scheduled; The Amount of Land Tax Requisition is Being Continued to Request Central Government to Reduce

[Reported by this newspaper from Zhenjiang on the 21st] When Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang replied to reporters' inquiries today, he said that the rumor that the Jiangsu Provincial Government would be reorganized has been spreading for three years, but the provincial government has not yet received a clear order. As a person from Jiangsu, I only know how to serve my hometown, and I will obey the central government's orders for my departure and stay, so there is no need to dispel the rumors. As for the conscription quota for the second phase of this year, it is 3,600 people. However, because the bandit chaos in northern Jiangsu is frequent and the people's livelihood is difficult, the counties in southern Jiangsu cannot be biased. Therefore, I personally wrote to Commander-in-Chief Gu, requesting a reduction in the quota. Recently, I received a reply from Commander-in-Chief Gu, stating that the military administration is important during the suppression period, and the quota must still be conscripted as scheduled. Regarding the requisition of land, the central government had previously approved the tax rate for land in this province for the 37th year as one tax and one loan. The provincial government and the Provisional Consultative Council repeatedly telegraphed to request a reduction.

Upon receiving a telegram from the Shanghai District Special Relief Donation Fundraising Committee, since this month, there have been continuous voluntary donations, but there is still a large gap from the prescribed quota. The committee has formulated two other measures to increase the effectiveness of fundraising. The first is to select the main wealthy people in the city and notify them to donate, and the legislators will personally persuade them to increase the effect. The second is to compile statistics on the settlement of foreign exchange and determine the amount of donations to make up for the shortage. All are being actively carried out, and the goal is to raise the fixed amount. Once the number of donations is reached, a list will be created and reported. It also passed the approval of the design of the honorary medal, which will be cast immediately for use. Also, the committee members who attended the meeting were very dissatisfied with the fact that Du Jianshi, the mayor of Tianjin, violated the law, changed the intention of the donors, and used part of the special relief donation funds to build city defense works. It was unanimously decided to immediately send a severe telegram to correct the misuse of funds and order them to be returned to the treasury within a specified period.

Gui Sui [Our Newspaper Gui Sui 21st Dispatch] Various banks and money houses in Gui Sui have been ordered to close, and the market is very stable.

### Moscow Negotiations Approach Critical Point Three Envoys to Meet Stalin Tomorrow Weekend of Constant Consultations to Reconcile Differences

[French News Agency London 21st Dispatch] The US State Department announced this morning that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov did not hold talks with the representatives of the three Western European powers in Moscow on the 20th.

[Associated Press London 21st Dispatch] Western countries urgently studied the reports of envoys stationed in the Soviet Union on the 21st and exchanged views on the situation in Berlin, preparing for the next Kremlin talks. There are rumors here and in Paris that Stalin will personally attend the next meeting. It is also said that, regardless of success or failure, this is the last meeting, but there is no verification. On the contrary, authoritative sources here warn against speaking of success or failure at this time. According to every indication, the current East-West negotiations have reached a critical juncture, but there is still no conclusive progress.

Foreign Secretary Bevin plans to stay in London over the weekend and report the situation to Prime Minister Attlee, who is currently on vacation in Ireland. Western countries are constantly engaged in heated discussions, preparing to deal with the most important, or perhaps the final, talks, which will be held on the 23rd. However, officials say that the meeting has been extended because the three governments need to adjust their opinions.

[Associated Press London 21st Dispatch] The bi-monthly "International Observer" published by the British government's Central News Bureau hinted on the 21st that the Soviet Union had refused to lift the blockade of Berlin in the Kremlin meeting. This hint came at a time when Western diplomats were warning everyone to refrain from predicting the success or failure of the Moscow negotiations. At the same time, the Berlin radio station controlled by the Soviet Union said that Moscow reported that the Kremlin talks were "about to break down." However, the Soviet newspapers and radio stations in Germany adopted a "cold and hot" attitude towards the talks, aimed at preparing the general public for both success and failure. The "International Observer" remained silent about the content of the negotiations, but said that "Western countries still insist that the Berlin blockade should be lifted before discussions on broader issues begin."

[Associated Press London 21st Dispatch] The Berlin radio station denied on the 21st that it had reported the news that "Moscow telegrams indicated that the talks between the Kremlin and Western envoys were about to break down."

[Central News Agency Moscow 20th Associated Press] Disagreements among the three Western countries themselves seem to be delaying the sixth, or perhaps final, meeting between Western representatives and Molotov. Well-informed observers firmly believe that the three Western countries have not yet reached a firm agreement on what to explain to Molotov in the next meeting. In the past few days, the representatives have repeatedly held meetings, and the representatives have exchanged opinions with their own governments and among the three governments several times. There are apparently some minor differences among the representatives of the three Western countries, which must be resolved before they meet with the Soviet Union again.

### Soviet Troops Cross Border in Berlin to Capture German Police US Military Commander Lodges Protest Armed British and American Military Police Stationed on Border to Suppress

The three policemen were captured yesterday by several Soviet soldiers at the intersection of the American and Soviet sectors. Colonel Holley said that if his protest is ineffective, the matter will be handed over to his superiors. He also said, "We can also take other measures to deal with it."

[Associated Press Berlin 21st Dispatch] Three squads of US military police suppression teams will be stationed in the downtown intersection area on the night of the 21st, as Soviet military police have been constantly capturing German police from the British and American sectors in that area. Each suppression team consists of 25 people, fully armed. According to indications, if the Soviet side continues to cross the border to capture people, the American side will resist. It is reported that the dispatch of the suppression teams was decided by senior police officers during an inspection of the incident site and approved by Ai Xihua, head of the American public security team. It is reported that British officials are also dispatching reserves to strengthen the strength of the military police. On the afternoon of the 21st, British and American military police jeeps shuttled through the streets of the intersection, and hundreds of curious German, British, American, and Soviet people stood on the sides of the street, waiting for the next action in the East-West police war.

[Associated Press Berlin 21st Dispatch] Soviet military police arrested two more German policemen in Berlin on the 21st. At the same time, the leader of the German Communist Party called for street riots, urging workers to go to the Potsdam Square connecting the British, American, and Soviet sectors to "attack black market merchants and Fascist Party members." British officials said that the two German policemen were kidnapped within 120 yards of the British sector by about 50 Soviet military police patrolling Potsdam Square, who pointed their guns at them. One policeman struggled free and escaped into a dilapidated house, while the other was dragged into the Soviet sector.

[French News Agency Berlin 20th Dispatch] Colonel Holley, commander of the US military in Berlin, issued a communiqué today stating that the unfortunate incident on the 19th in the Putsdamai area, in which the police shot and injured six people, could have been avoided if the Soviet sector German police officers had not been known criminals. The continued tenure of Marcgraf as the police chief of the Soviet sector is an insult to the Berlin City Council elected by the people, so it is no wonder that the general public despises the police. However, in any case, the police should not fire at unarmed people. Holley concluded by saying that the US military government has done its best to eliminate speculators in the black market, but the inability to eliminate the black market is due to the Soviet blockade of Berlin.

### US Military Officer Reveals Soviet Plan to Conquer the World

[Central News Agency Washington 20th Special Dispatch] According to the Washington non-official publication "Field Artillery Report" today, the Soviet Union has notified its vassal states that the chaos occurring in the Far East, Greece, and Palestine will create an environment favorable to the Kremlin's strategic plan to conquer the world. The paper was written by a retired Colonel Nan Sha. He said that the Soviet Union's plan to conquer the world was formulated last November and secretly distributed to its vassal states as a compass. Nan revealed that the content of the Soviet plan includes four stages: (1) Consolidate the internal unity of the vassal states; (2) Establish communist governments in Germany, Italy, and France; (3) Conquer Britain without war, because the power of its left-wing parties is increasing; (4) The United States is the final target, because its economic crisis will definitely worsen, and the US Communist Party will gain the power to control labor unions.

### US Senior Military Leaders Hold Meeting in Rhode Island Secretary of Defense Reports on US-Canada Discussions on Joint Defense

[Central News Agency Washington 21st Dispatch] According to Secretary of Defense Forrestal, senior military leaders in Washington have chosen the Naval War College in Rhode Island to hold a three-day meeting to discuss "major policy issues." Although the content of the discussions is strictly kept secret and no communiqué will be issued during the meeting, officials have revealed that the agenda will include issues related to strategic air force operations, secret weapons researched by US scientists, and their applications. Forrestal will report on his recent discussions in Ottawa on the US-Canada joint defense plan. US Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg, who returned to the United States from Europe today, will also report on the situation of the US Air Force being transferred to Berlin. Participants in the meeting also include Army Chief of Staff Bradley, Chief of Military Order and Planning Weidmeyer, and other senior leaders of the navy and air force.

[French News Agency Washington 20th Dispatch] Two days after US Secretary of Defense Forrestal went to Canada to meet with Canadian Minister of National Defence Claxton to discuss joint defense affairs between the two countries, he held a secret meeting with the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force at the Naval Academy in Newport, Rhode Island. According to well-informed sources, the results of the talks between Forrestal and Claxton will be included in the agenda, but not exclusively. The meeting will also discuss the extent to which the plan decided by the Chiefs of Staff of the three services at the Key West, Florida meeting in March has been implemented. The Key West meeting decided on the unification of the affairs of the three services, which has been accelerated with the support of Forrestal, but there are still some differences, especially Air Force Secretary Symington's insistence on establishing 70 Air Force groups, while Forrestal prefers 66 groups. It is expected that the Newport meeting will try to complete the unification of the affairs of the three services and will discuss the best way to utilize the new recruits who will be conscripted under the draft system. The meeting will also discuss military issues caused by the current international situation, so it will involve the results of Forrestal's talks with Claxton and the Canadian government's decision to increase its army from 35,000 to 42,000 personnel before Forrestal went to Canada. It is rumored that Forrestal and Claxton discussed US-Canada cooperation in jointly defending the northern part of the American continent. US military leaders believe that this area is strategically important, so it is necessary to build a network of gun emplacements and air force bases around it to ensure safety.

### Military Aid to Western Europe Canada Willing to Cooperate with the United States

[French News Agency Ottawa 21st Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, during the visit of US Secretary of Defense Forrestal to Canada to hold talks with the Canadian Minister of National Defence, the issue of Canada's participation in supplying arms to the signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty was one of the main agenda items. According to authoritative sources, Canada can export arms worth US$200 million annually to Western European countries through the United States. Well-informed people in the Canadian capital also said that before the economic recovery of Western Europe is completed, it seems necessary to first assist the military recovery of Western Europe. It was also heard that before Forrestal returned home, he paid great attention to the Canadian Defense Industries Commission, which was commissioned by the Canadian government to provide the Canadian government with information on domestic military potential.

### 79 US Jet Aircraft Arrive in Germany

[Associated Press Munich 20th Dispatch] The US Air Force announced on the 20th that 79 of the 83 F80 jet aircraft that recently arrived in Scotland from the United States have been reassembled and flown to an airport near here.

### After the US Sets a Deadline for the Soviet Consul General to Leave the US The Soviet Union May Take Retaliatory Measures Lomakin Has Booked a Ship Ticket and Will Leave the US Next Saturday

[Associated Press Washington 21st Dispatch] The State Department braced itself on the 21st to deal with Moscow's new diplomatic offensive. Diplomatic circles here expect that the Soviet Union will have a swift and sharp reaction to the US request that Soviet Consul General in New York Lomakin return home immediately. Officials said that this was one of the most unpleasant events between the two countries since the war, and the Soviet Union has expressed resentment. Some people expect that the Soviet Union will take retaliatory measures against US consular personnel stationed in Moscow and Vladivostok. It is also said that the Soviet government will be forced to "fabricate some absurd charges against our officials—which they have done before."

[Associated Press New York 20th Dispatch] Consul General Lomakin, who was requested by the State Department to be recalled by the Soviet government for "improper actions" in the Samson Case, has booked a ticket on the "Stockholm" mail ship, which is scheduled to sail on the 28th. Although Lomakin himself refused to comment on the US government's condemnation of his "highly improper" behavior, he told reporters waiting at the door of the consulate: "You are wasting your time," but his plans were still leaked by an employee of the Swedish American Line. The employee said that Lomakin had notified the company by letter a few days ago that he had booked tickets for himself, his wife, and their two children.

### Soviet Plot to Stage Coup in South [Yugoslavia] - Moscow Establishes "Free Yugoslavia" Committee - Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Denounces Tito Regime

[Central News Agency, London, 20th] A Central News Agency reporter has learned from sources here today that Moscow is currently plotting to launch a coup in Yugoslavia to overthrow the Tito regime and establish a legitimate Stalinist communist government. It is reported that Stalin has issued a decree to establish a "Free Yugoslavia Committee" in the Soviet capital, composed of anti-Tito Yugoslav exiles in the Soviet Union. It is rumored that if Tito is overthrown, Bekold-Tijanić has been designated to succeed him. It is generally believed that Bekold is currently in Moscow.

[Associated Press, Budapest, 20th] Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Rajkótsi delivered a speech to 70,000 farmers on the 20th, denouncing Marshal Tito's regime as a "gangster leader" that inflicts terror, pain, abuse, and even tragedy on Yugoslavia. He stated, "Tito and his subordinates basely murdered their heroes and employed terrorist tactics throughout the country. They tormented, imprisoned, and abused comrades who supported the Soviet Union, the Cominform, and the trade unions." Rajkótsi further criticized Lieutenant General Ivanožić for being fatally shot while attempting to flee to Romania. Two days before Rajkótsi's attack on this matter, the Romanian Gazette denounced it as a "despicable murder." Rajkótsi continued, "The current 'gangster leaders' of Yugoslavia are leading our southern neighbors to tragedy."

This matter indicates that Lomakin had already packed his bags before the U.S. government requested his recall. It remains uncertain whether Lomakin's plan to leave the U.S. was because he already knew of the State Department's action, or whether Moscow had already ordered him to return home in response to his actions in the Kasenkina case. Lomakin is apparently the only senior Soviet official in New York who decided to leave the U.S. immediately. According to a spokesman for the Swedish American Line, no other Soviet consulate personnel have reserved cabins to return home. Soviet personnel generally travel via Sweden, disembarking in Gothenburg, traveling by car to Stockholm, and then taking a ship to Finland before returning to Moscow by train. News of Lomakin's return home was initially released by an employee of the Swedish American Line in Gothenburg, and then confirmed here.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 20th] The State Department today publicly announced the note delivered to the Soviet ambassador yesterday. A State Department spokesman stated that the State Department had declared the revocation of the accreditation of the Soviet Consul General in New York, Lomakin, and requested that Mr. Lomakin leave the United States within 72 hours. The State Department spokesman also said that the U.S. government does not consider the Kasenkina and Samarin case to be closed with Lomakin's departure, and that the investigation will continue. The Soviet Consulate has made no comment on the U.S. note.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, Associated Press] Lomakin, the Soviet Consul General in New York who has been asked to return home by the United States, may depart for home next week to face his enraged superiors. The unfortunate Lomakin has placed Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in an awkward international position due to the case of the three Soviet teachers, and he has now been ordered to close the consulate and leave the United States within three or four days. President Truman's press secretary, Ross, stated that President Truman would not immediately withdraw Lomakin's credentials, as doing so would force him to close the consulate immediately and place an unnecessary burden on the embassy. The order to withdraw the credentials may be issued within three or four days, at which time Lomakin will leave the United States as an ordinary Soviet citizen without any official title. Reporters generally believe that Lomakin will inevitably face severe criticism upon his return home. The hospital where Mrs. Kasenkina is staying issued a statement stating that her condition has "improved," but she is still not out of danger. Her eating and breathing are better than before, and her temperature has "slightly decreased, and her pulse is closer to normal."

### New Developments Expected in Soviet Teachers Case - U.S. State Department Spokesman Announces

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 20th] A State Department spokesman told reporters today that further developments are undoubtedly expected in the case of the Russian female teacher.

### Soviets Expand Air Force - Current Air Force Personnel Number 400,000 - Monthly Aircraft Production is 1,000

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 20th] According to the 1948 World Aviation Yearbook, the Soviet Union currently has an air force of 400,000 personnel and 14,000 aircraft, including jet aircraft. Currently, the Soviet Union can produce 1,000 aircraft per month, including heavy bombers similar to the B-29 and 200 jet aircraft. The Soviet Union has dozens of aircraft manufacturing plants, mostly located within European territory, especially concentrated in the Volga River basin. A small number of factories are also located in the Urals and Siberia, engaged in the manufacturing of five types of jet aircraft. In terms of civil aviation, the Soviet Union's major cities are all served by air routes. However, some cities' airfields cannot be used year-round due to severe weather conditions. The Soviet Union has established 79 weather stations throughout the Arctic Circle, and their work has been highly successful. Finally, according to the yearbook's estimate, the Soviet Union imported aircraft parts from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom this year, worth a total of $1.5 million.

### MacArthur Approves Transfer of Yokohama and Kobe Port Management to Japan - Japanese to Be Responsible for Operations Starting October 1st

Currently, these ports are under the administration of the occupation forces. Any port facilities necessary for the occupation forces to load and unload cargo or to serve military vessels will remain under the administration of the occupation forces.

This conspiracy coincided with General Franco's summer vacation in the Mierras district of Galicia and the arrival of many travelers to coastal towns and villages in Cantabria. Police captured communists in La Coruña in Galicia and Pamplona in Navarre, confiscating firearms, ammunition, and anti-government propaganda. A total of nine communist leaders were captured at the communist headquarters in a magnificent mansion in La Coruña. It is claimed that police secret operations have obtained complete information about the communist organization in northern Spain.

### Japan Plans to Expand Police Force Under Pretext of Suppressing Riots - Authorities Determined to Stop Labor Unrest Across the Country

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Saito, the chief of the Japanese National Police Headquarters, visited Cabinet Secretary General Kometi on the morning of the 21st to exchange views on the issue of expanding police equipment. It is reported that Mr. Saito requested strengthening police administration on the grounds of suppressing violent groups. Because the quota of police officers is limited, he planned to enrich mobile equipment and sought the government's opinion. As a result, Tomibechi believed that the matter was related to the budget and hoped that a specific plan for enriching mobile equipment would be submitted.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] The Hokkaido branch of the National Railway Workers' Union has been on strike for many days since July to protest the revision of the National Public Service Law. The Ministry of Transportation authorities believe that this fact violates government orders and have arrested 15 branch committee members, leading to a further deterioration of the situation. In the Hakodate branch, the number of participants in the strike movement has reached as many as 475, greatly reducing the number of freight cars running and causing great obstacles to transportation operations. As of 5 p.m. on the 20th, 98 people had resumed work, and the National Police had issued 442 arrest warrants, with 169 people having been arrested. In addition, Saito, chief of the National Police Headquarters, stated on the 20th that he would take a "tough stance of prosecuting those who do not resume work."

During the debate, the chairman of the Defense Committee, Teilas, pointed out that the military budget accounts for 27 percent of the French total budget, so its percentage can be considered normal. The French army must not exceed 600,000 people under the current budget proposal, and its food expenses require 120 million francs, with the remaining funds to be used for equipment innovation.

### Canada Has Abundant Uranium Production - All for Domestic Needs

### Prelude to the American Election, No. 3 - Cheap Political Tricks

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing

[Airmail from This Newspaper, New York, August 2nd] In American history, it is rare to use the halls of Congress as a campaign ground. Although President Truman's sudden summoning of a "special session" was scolded by Taft as a "cheaply auctioned political trick," and although it was scolded by Vandenberg as "the hysterical gasps of a dying regime before its demise," the special session was, after all, convened. Truman's "ruthless move" undoubtedly, as the "New York Times" said, dealt a serious blow to the Republican Party's prestige in the November election.

On the day Congress convened, all American Republican newspapers, as well as newspapers related to the Republican Party, published a photograph of "sparse attendance in the hall." There were two congressmen, and they placed their legs on the seats in the front row. The photographer was probably specifically choosing the emptiest corner to photograph, because in reality, the hall did not appear empty. Out of a total of 435 congressmen, 310 attended this time, which was no more inferior than usual. Before the meeting on Monday, the Republican senators and representatives had an informal meeting to discuss how to deal with Truman's "ruthless move."

President Truman did not go to Congress to give a speech until noon on Tuesday, reading his speech manuscript for only 24 minutes. He emphasized the economic crisis in the United States, especially the crisis of rising prices caused by inflation. He said: "The communists are counting the days of economic depression in the United States every day. We must avoid this depression." He also said: "If the economic foundation of the United States is shaken, the serious consequences suffered by other parts of the world will be unimaginable." He believes that today's world situation is very urgent. In order to cope with emergencies, we cannot wait until the next session of Congress convenes. We must immediately convene this special summer session of Congress to jointly discuss the major policies and strategies of the country.

The President's speech was grand and was a direct challenge to the Republican Party. For the "die-hards" in the South, Truman used a way to avoid the important and take the light, hoping to gently flash through. In the entire speech, regarding the "National Rights Bill," there were only 113 simple words, the general idea being: In order to forever maintain the brilliance of the American Constitution and thoroughly realize the concepts of freedom and equality for American citizens, it is necessary to eliminate racial discrimination, racial prejudice, and ensure that American citizens of all races have equal employment opportunities. Therefore, the National Rights Protection Bill is proposed.

The "die-hards" in the South caused strong resentment in Congress. Mississippi Congressman Colmer declared that he would swear to oppose Truman. Senator Johnston from South Carolina advocated an immediate adjournment so everyone could go home for the summer. Every time Congress convened for debate over the past week, Johnston had the same expression: "This meeting is simply boring, a waste of energy, a waste of money, and boring to the extreme!" He urged everyone to agree with his opinion and immediately adjourn the special session of Congress until December 31st to discuss these bills!" In fact, Johnston did not sincerely intend to not hold a meeting. He wanted to deliberately attack Truman and give Truman a "disappointing start."

The most severe of the Southern Congressmen is Georgia Senator Russell, who is the foremost figure opposing the "National Rights Protection Bill." He knows that the number of Southern congressmen is small and the vote will inevitably fail, so he advocates cooperating with the Republican Party. The South supports the Republican Party's opposition to Truman's "price control plan," hoping that the Republican Party will support the South's opposition to the "National Rights Bill." Russell hopes to make Truman's proposed "National Rights Protection Bill" an amendment to the American Constitution, and a constitutional amendment is not as easy to pass as ordinary laws.

However, Taft rejected Russell's proposal. Taft believes that the Republican Party opposes all of Truman's proposals, except for agreeing to Truman's "National Rights Protection Bill," because since President Lincoln, the Republican Party has consistently advocated improving the social status of blacks and has consistently advocated racial equality. Taft is almost the busiest person in Congress. He is the highest person in charge of domestic affairs for both the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Republican Party.

Taft's theoretical basis is: First, Truman's views on fiscal economics are not accurate at all. Truman's high-profile is to deceive the world and steal fame, to deceive the American people, and to fight for the November election. Second, Trúman himself has no intention of stopping inflation, because the formation of inflation in the United States today is due to the government's abuse of money. Truman does not stop the administrative agency's "abuse" but comes to Congress to appeal, which is completely a political speech. (The American people deeply detest the term "playing politics" because "playing politics" means unreal.) Third, Truman's so-called price control measures are completely the style of a "police state" and run counter to the traditional American concept of free enterprise.

In Congress, the orthodox faction of the Democratic Party (except for the "die-hards" in the South) mostly support Truman. The great debater Barkley, this 70-year-old Kentucky senator, Truman's "campaign companion," lashed out at Taft. He said: Taft himself is playing political tricks. He believes that Congress should be selfless and impartial, seek welfare for the people, and not be bound by preconceptions.

Generally speaking, the most important topics of this special session are the two major issues of price control and stopping inflation. The President's Council of Economic Advisers sent Congress a "mid-year report," which separately described employment, wages, production, trade, and rapidly rising prices. One sentence in the report stated that the Congress under the control of the Republican Party is blindly and unscrupulously deepening the economic crisis in the United States.

Republicans strongly expressed indignation at this passage. They believe that Truman's challenge is overly fierce. House Banking Committee Chairman Wolcott, a Republican congressman from Michigan, angrily accused the government of spending money too easily, creating credit inflation, and thus inflation. He said: "The United States today has no price controls, no rationing system, but there is still a large, large amount of production." He said: "Rising prices are not a matter of control or not, it depends on whether the government can contract credit!"

In the Senate and House Banking Committees, the debate on economic issues was very intense and very profound. Paul Porter, the price control director who was considered a "thorn in the side" by Republican congressmen two years ago, appeared again before many Republican congressmen with disgust. Paul Porter is still so calm. This economic expert with a scholarly air has been retained by Truman in the President's Office as Truman's economic advisor since the Price Control Bureau was abolished in 1946. Most of Truman's economic management theory, the "police state" theory deeply hated by Republican congressmen, comes from Paul Porter. He was again designated by Truman this time as the representative to explain relevant economic bills. He is responsible for explaining the economic bills proposed by the President to Congress.

Secretary of the Treasury Snyder and Federal Reserve Board Chairman McCabe were also invited to Congress to explain the economic situation along with Paul Porter. The Secretary of the Treasury believed that he has always opposed price controls, but in times of emergency, they are also necessary. He believes that controlling prices and contracting credit are both the most important virtues for the United States today. McCabe, on the other hand, believes that it is too idealistic to completely expect "contracting credit." He reported that today's American currency is three times that of before the war, while the total amount of production has only increased by 90 percent compared to before the war (less than double), so restoring wartime consumer credit control is an urgent matter. However, if the people are willing and able to slightly limit the national purchasing power, it will be of great benefit to prices.

However, Senator Tauber, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, disagrees. He believes that limiting consumption will inevitably kill production. He said: The only way to solve the economic problems of the United States is to increase production, production first. He said: Free prices are the best way to reward production. With increased production, prices will naturally fall. He said that Truman's economic theory is putting the cart before the horse.

The debate has not ended yet, and it seems that Truman's eleven proposals will inevitably end without results. Truman summoned such an "emergency special session" in the midst of his busy schedule. If viewed from the perspective of us Chinese, today's price problem in the United States is really not worthy of the slightest bit of urgency. Opposing racial bias is originally a good thing, but it is not an urgent problem either. The Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army said: "The U.S. Army's separate organization of blacks and whites has a consistent and excellent tradition. The Army authorities have no intention of changing to a mixed organization." Southern Senator Manpunk quoted the Chief of Staff's words and greatly attacked Truman. Mississippi Senator Stennis gave a speech in Congress for two and a half hours, analyzing the historical basis for the Southern treatment of blacks and whites separately. He said: If Truman wants to use a law to create a tragedy in the South, it would be tantamount to Hitler's actions.

Of course, this is not an urgent issue that can be resolved overnight. The reason why it is "urgent" and "special" is all for the "political tactics" of the November election. Taft said angrily in the corridor of the Congress building: "Why call an emergency meeting? I can't find any emergency reasons!" A reporter asked: "Is it because of the Berlin crisis emergency?" Taft suddenly felt something, he pushed his glasses up, raised his head, and couldn't help but laugh!

### Punishing Activities Disrupting Prices - Most Severe Means Will Be Applied - Joint Meeting of Top Leaders Discusses Two Points - Chiang Ching-kuo Assists in Supervising and Guiding Work to Stabilize Finance and Prices

[Report from this newspaper] At 11:00 AM yesterday, an important joint meeting was held at the Yuyuan Road residence of Central Bank President Yu. Those in attendance were all top leaders and relevant personnel from this city, including Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Xuan Tiewu, Xu Baiyuan, Yu Shuping, Chiang Ching-kuo, etc. The meeting lasted until 1:30 PM, and the contents were kept secret. It is reported that the main topics of discussion were how to overcome possible difficulties in implementing emergency financial and economic measures, and how to punish those who disrupt price stability. It is possible that a supervisory organization will be established in Shanghai in the future, presided over by Yu Hongjun and Chiang Ching-kuo, specializing in supervising and guiding the work of stabilizing finance and prices. After the market opens tomorrow, financial authorities and relevant local agencies will closely coordinate to supervise various transactions. The most severe means will be used to deal with black market transactions and activities that disrupt prices, and if necessary, a few will be executed as a warning to others.

### Mayor's Three Proclamations: Stabilize Prices - Only Allowed to Fall, Not Rise; Problems Will Be Resolved Immediately

The municipal government, in order to cooperate with the central government's new financial and economic plan, convened a meeting with representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors at 10:00 AM on the 21st. More than 50 responsible individuals from various trade associations attended, and Mayor Wu personally presided. First, Mayor Wu declared that after the central government's decision was announced, the people and the government should share the same confidence. Hereafter, prices should no longer fluctuate. He then made three proclamations to the representatives from various industries: (1) All prices will be based on the prices of the 19th as the standard. They are only allowed to decrease, not increase. Anyone who raises prices without authorization will be severely punished by the government. (2) Black markets will not be allowed to exist. (3) If industrial and commercial enterprises encounter special difficulties, the government will find ways to solve them. Finally, Mayor Wu expressed that stabilizing finance, stabilizing prices, increasing production, and developing trade are critical to success, and he urged everyone to comply diligently. Subsequently, Mr. Xu Xueyu spoke on behalf of the attendees, saying that the central government's new policy would greatly benefit the industrial and commercial sectors and solve many current difficulties. The industrial and commercial sectors should support it, and the matter of maintaining the prices of the 19th should be followed. However, he hoped that the government would also abide by it together with the people in the future, and that state-owned enterprises should set an example. He also hoped that the price of the next rice ration would not be increased again. Mayor Wu agreed to consult the central government before making a decision. Afterwards, various industries successively explained the current situation. Generally, it was very stable, and wholesale prices had mostly fallen. Only some peddlers who did not understand the true nature of the government's measures had raised prices. It was believed that this phenomenon could be eliminated. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM.

### First Announcement After the New Currency: Gasoline Prices Reduced

### Difficulties in Reducing Automobile Licenses: The Reason Lies in the Continued Import of Military Vehicles

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the matter of reducing automobile licenses, a person in charge of the relevant department of the Public Utilities Bureau told reporters yesterday that there were indeed difficulties in implementing this in this city. However, the problem was not in offending influential figures, but mainly because vehicles were still being imported as of now. If the central government allows the import of cars while ordering local governments to reduce the number of licenses already issued, this would be the biggest problem. Furthermore, the streets in this city are narrow and traffic conditions are complex. Tricycles and rickshaws are particularly obstructive to traffic. Therefore, the issuance of licenses for these vehicles had already been decided to be stopped. If automobile licenses are reduced on the one hand, and at the same time, the issuance of tricycle and rickshaw licenses is absolutely not allowed due to traffic problems, this would also be quite troublesome for the staff handling the matter.

Land Appreciation Tax: Tax Rate Divided into Four Types

(2) If the actual amount of land appreciation is below 200% of the original price, 40% will be levied. (3) If the actual amount of land appreciation is below 300% of the original price, 60% will be levied. (4) If the actual amount of land appreciation exceeds 300%, 80% will be levied.

At that time, thousands of people's representatives will participate in the meeting, and its significance will include: (1) supporting the government's anti-traitor movement, (2) demonstrating the determination of the front lines to fight the rebellion unanimously, (3) after the currency reform, the lives of the soldiers on the front lines can be raised to pre-war levels, and social order in the rear will also become more stable. The meeting will ensure that both the front and rear deeply understand this point.

Earnestly Hope to Take On the Mission of Exchange

Subsequently, Mayor Wu, on behalf of the municipal government, Councilor Wang, Deputy Secretary-General of the National慰勞 General Association Lu Jingshi, and representatives from all sectors Yu Wen, Tan Yimin, Xie Yonghua, Luo Dunwei, and others delivered speeches one after another, all hoping that the慰勞 Group could shoulder the mission of exchanging opinions between the front and rear. Finally, Zhang Fang, the head of the group, and Xie Renzhao, the deputy head, answered, expressing their determination to accept the entrustment of all sectors and complete the task. At the same time, they suggested that this city should regularly launch慰勞 efforts in the future. For example, dance halls should be persuaded to donate慰勞 money, so that the soldiers on the front lines can be assured that all the citizens of this city are not living in a drunken stupor, and that a strong connection can be completed spiritually. Finally, Speaker Pan read a telegram from Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the慰勞 General Association, expressing gratitude to the singers of this city for going to the front lines to慰勞 the troops before Air Force Day. It is reported that the singers will be invited to attend and participate in the expanded publicity meeting on the 24th.

### Labor Office Holds Symposium on Wage Conversion Issues - Several Opinions Formulated - Submitted to the Evaluation Committee for Discussion

[Reported by this newspaper] After the currency reform, regarding the method of calculating wages for employees in various private industries in this city, the Social Affairs Bureau has already received instructions from the Ministry of Social Affairs, instructing it to study and formulate wage standards and implementation rules with reference to Articles 13, 14, 22, and 23 of the Measures for Consolidating Finance and Strengthening Economic Control, in order to reduce disputes. It is learned that before Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau went to Beijing, he instructed the Labor Office of the bureau to study methods for converting wages into Gold Yuan. Yesterday, the office convened all staff members of the Mediation and惠工 sections to hold a symposium on the issue of wage conversion. More than 30 people, including Fan Zhen and Huang Changhan, attended. Director Shen Ding chaired the meeting and, based on Article 22 of the Measures for Consolidating Finance and Strengthening Economic Control: "The salaries of employees in private enterprises shall be paid in Gold Yuan, but their semi-monthly income shall not exceed the amount in Legal Tender converted into Gold Yuan that the enterprise originally stipulated for the first half of August," the principles were studied. There was a thorough discussion on how to calculate wages for those who habitually use the previous period's index or the average of the previous period's and the current period's index, and how to convert wages for processing, suspension of work, reduced working hours, and piecework. Several opinions were formulated and will be submitted to Director Wu for review and then submitted to the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee for approval before implementation.

### Wages According to Pre-War Base Salary - Practically Impossible to Achieve

According to relevant sources who spoke to reporters, the wages of workers in various private industries were generally around 30 yuan before the war. After the Legal Tender was converted into Gold Yuan, the industrial sector hoped to restore the pre-war base salary. In fact, the value of the Gold Yuan is only half of the pre-war Legal Tender, so this is impossible to achieve. It is heard that the current wage conversion will be based on a method of gradually discounting workers' base salaries above 30 yuan, multiplying by the previous period's index for August, and then converting it into Gold Yuan for calculation.

At that time, other ticket collectors resting at the ticket booth near the station saw this and stepped forward to question him. Jiang became enraged and pulled out his official pistol and fired a shot, the bullet grazing Zhang Minggang's head and neck, injuring his scalp.

### Twelve Fishmongers Prosecuted for Forging Fish Market Entry Permits

[Reported by this newspaper] Fishmonger Qiu A'yu could not find an entry permit when the fish market was auctioning, so he could not enter. He had a bizarre idea and ordered Wang Changgui, who runs a flag shop, to make 31 forged "Shanghai Fish Market Auction Entry Permits."

### Two Russian Thugs - Vandalize Park Apartments - Maid Injured While Trying to Intervene

She used to have an Italian lover named Fang Tianqian, who was a senior employee at an Italian bank. He returned to his country six months ago to visit his family. At around 4:00 PM yesterday, Kainna went to celebrate her girlfriend's birthday. Unexpectedly, at around 6:30 PM, two Russian thugs suddenly came to the apartment and, without asking for any reason, vandalized all five or six rooms, scattering furniture everywhere.

### Public Utilities Review Committee Reviews Electricity Company Accounts and Proposes Four Points for Review

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Public Utilities Open Investigation and Review Committee held its second meeting at 3:30 PM yesterday in the City Hall conference room. Mayor Wu presided, and attendees included councilors Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran, Qu Yue, Li Wenjie, Shao Yongsheng, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce’s Yan E’sheng, General Labor Union’s Shui Xiangyun, Accountants Association’s He Yuanming, Electrical Engineers Association’s Pan Mingxin, Social Affairs Bureau’s Zhang Chude, Public Utilities Bureau’s Zhao Zengjue, and representatives from Shanghai, French, Zhabei, Huxi, Pudong, and Chinese-owned electricity companies, totaling over twenty people. The chairman first reported that the initial general meeting had resolved to notify each company to provide various materials for public review and decided to first review the Shanghai Electric Power Company's income and expenditure accounts. The review would commence immediately. Shanghai Electric Power Company presented a detailed report on business income and expenditure yesterday, distributed to each committee member. The income and expenditure report covered the period from August 1, 1947, to July 31, 1948, with a total reported loss of 178.6 billion yuan, and a loss of 92.6 billion yuan in July of this year. During yesterday's review by the committee, the focus was initially on reviewing the accounts for July of this year, item by item. As a result of the review, the following four points were raised: (1) Coal and fuel oil are the lifeblood of public utilities, and this expenditure is the most significant, with coal accounting for 20% and oil accounting for 80%. According to the company's report, the minimum monthly requirement for coal and oil is 18,000 tons. However, the ratio of coal or oil required per kilowatt-hour of electricity was not provided by Shanghai Electric Power Company at yesterday's meeting, and it was decided to review this again at the next meeting. (2) Regarding the issue of employee salaries, according to statistical results, the percentage of employee salaries in each kilowatt-hour of electricity cost is 13.4% for Shanghai Electric Power Company, 21.1% for the French company, 13.7% for Zhabei, 20.1% for the Chinese company, and 18.5% for Pudong. Pan Mingxin, the representative of the Electrical Engineers Association, considered the above percentages to be reasonable. (3) Among the expenditures of Shanghai Electric Power Company, there is a type of fee called a consulting fee, in English known as EBASCO. It is said to be paid by the company to its American headquarters for liaison and cooperation purposes. For example, when Shanghai Electric Power Company needs to purchase materials, it can entrust the headquarters to handle it. Regarding this consulting fee and the exchange rate for salaries paid in US dollars, committee member Li Wenjie hoped that the company would report on it at the next meeting. (4) In the company's accounts, there is an item called the "military external reserve fund," which is a significant amount. According to the company, due to the drastic changes in currency value in the past, it was necessary to assume a number to guard against the depreciation of the legal tender. This is what is meant by "paying in advance," but it is not actually used.

Finally, Mayor Wu declared that since the government reformed the currency system, the cost of living index has been abolished, and foreign exchange can be considered stable, then the crisis of public utility price increases can also be eliminated, expressing optimism about the future. The committee did not complete the review of Shanghai Electric Power Company's accounts at yesterday's meeting and resolved to convene the third meeting at 3:00 PM next Monday to review the review work. Company representatives may not be invited. If necessary, the company will be asked to submit income and expenditure statistics and other forms for review purposes.

### Talking about Siming with its Thousands of Peaks and Ridges

— Our Newspaper Reporter Huang Xingtian

A newly established fourth-class county in Zhejiang is realized in the mountainous area of "six not governed"

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 20th] On August 11th, the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference approved the establishment of Siming County in Zhejiang Province. The long-pending issue of setting up Siming County since the restoration has finally been realized.

Siming County is located between the six counties of Yuyao, Shangyu, Cixi, Yinxian, Fenghua, and Shengxian in eastern Zhejiang. It is a mountainous area centered on Siming Mountain. The main purpose of setting up the county is to facilitate public security and administrative management. This mountainous area is far from the county seats, with thousands of peaks and ridges and inconvenient transportation. Even in peaceful times, bandits often appeared. During the War of Resistance, after the "April 18th" fall of Ningbo, this area became a haven for wandering troops. After the victory, bandits used the gap of "six not governed" as their base of operations. The Zhejiang Provincial Government, aware of this, resolved to establish the county in the provincial administrative conference in the winter of 1945, and dispatched special commissioners to conduct on-site surveys and propose opinions. In September 1946, in order to clear the bandits in this border area, a bandit suppression headquarters was set up in Lianghong, and the Siming Pacification Office was established to actively promote the establishment of the county.

New County Area

According to the provincial government's plan, the area of Siming County includes the six townships of Zuoxi, Yaxian, Xiaoyun, Rangxian, Bailu, and Nanlan, and Lianghong Town, originally belonging to Yuyao; parts of the two townships of Donghe and Xiaguan and the two townships of Daze and Cennan, originally belonging to Shangyu; the two townships of Wulian and Xiehe, originally belonging to Shengxian; most of the two townships of Shanmin and Shanhhou, originally belonging to Fenghua; Nanshan Township and Lubu Town, and parts of the two townships of Chejiu and Dayin, originally belonging to Cixi; and the four townships of Zhangxi, Dajiao, Zhangmi, and Longhe, and parts of the four townships of Yinghu, Wuling, Meiyuan, and Yinzhang, originally belonging to Yinxian. The entire county consists of 27 townships and towns, 220 bao, 2,894 jia, 37,943 households, and 155,318 people. The area is 1,079.226 square kilometers, with an average of 144 people per square kilometer.

Four Holes in the Mountains

The Siming Mountain range originates from Tiantai, and its main mountain is Shichuang Mountain (also known as Huogai Mountain), located at the former junction of the four counties of Yuyao, Fenghua, Shengxian, and Shangyu. Because there is a huge rock on the southwest hillside of Shichuang Mountain with four holes in the rock, shaped like windows, called Shichuang, it is named after the windows, hence the name Siming Mountain. Since Siming County is located in the mountainous area, transportation is greatly affected. Land transportation is centered on Lianghong, passing through Youta Mountain and Qingxian Ridge to reach Yuyao. Northeast, it passes through Gaodi Ridge, exits Longkeng, passes Nanmiao, and reaches Yuyao (that is, Yu-Liang Highway). Northwest, it passes Huangzhu Ridge to Shangyu (that is, Yu-Bai Highway). The ancient road is centered on Qingtinggang, which can reach all directions, but it is very dangerous. Water transportation can only use bamboo rafts. The upper reaches of the Yaojiang River originate from Yang'e Ridge in the southern part of the county, pass through Lianghong Baziqiao to Jiangkou, forming the Simingjiang River. The rivers branching from Jiangkou can reach Tongmingba in the suburbs of Shangyu, and its main stream merges with the Yaojiang River, passing through Ningbo to reach the sea, with small ships coming and going for transportation. Most of the county is mountainous streams, which can only be used to transport bamboo rafts and cannot be considered water transportation. Aware of this, the provincial government had already opened the Yu-Liang and Yu-Bai (Baiguan) highways, but due to limited funding, they have not yet been completed. The provincial government has set a deadline for completion by the end of this year. In addition, due to the needs of bandit suppression military affairs, the provincial government plans to build four highways centered on the future new county seat - Qingtinggang - to connect the entire mountainous area. One starts from Yinjiang Bridge in Yinxian, passes through Dajiao, to Qingtinggang. One starts from Fenghua, passes through Tingxia or Xikou, Tangtian, and reaches Qingtinggang. One starts from Shengxian, passes through Baizhuang (that is, Beiwei), and reaches Qingtinggang. It is currently being carried out by the Highway Bureau.

Special Products

Since the entire county is mountainous, only the northeastern part has a slight plain. The arable land is less than 200,000 mu, accounting for only one-eightieth of the total area. The produced rice and miscellaneous grains are not enough to support themselves, and food is even more scarce in the southern part. The main products are bamboo, wood, firewood, charcoal, local paper, tea, and bamboo shoots. The mountain people rely entirely on these mountain goods to exchange for a small amount of rice and food, living a difficult life. In addition, fritillaria thunbergii from Zhangmi Township and silkworm silk, and ginkgo from Dajiao Township are considered special products. Commerce is most prosperous in Lianghong in southern Yuyao, which is the center of trade in the mountainous area, followed by the three markets of Dajiao, Xiaguan, and Zhangzhen, and then Shanling Village and Zhongcun. Lianghong is not only the most prosperous in commerce, but also has the largest population, with more than 1,000 households, making it the largest town in the area. During the period of occupation, it was once occupied by the "35th Detachment of the New Fourth Army" and was called the "Yan'an of Eastern Zhejiang." Currently, it is the political and military center of the Siming Mountain area, and is called the command post of Siming Mountain, and will also be the location of the temporary Siming County seat.

The economic foundation of Siming is so weak, and the difficulty of the county's finances can be imagined. However, the responsibility it bears - public security - is so important. Currently, in order to deal with four or five hundred bandits, there are pacification funds available for allocation. In the future, to maintain such a fourth-class county, it must be subsidized by the provincial finances.

### Haikou Shilu Mine Plans to Increase Production

Annual Production of Two Million Tons Possible in Five Years

[Our Newspaper Haikou, 21st] Shilu Mine recently formulated a five-year production increase plan, which is expected to complete the unfinished mining projects left by the Japanese in Shilu and Bali by 1949. It is planned to produce 600,000 tons of ore in 1950, 1 million tons of ore in 1951, 1.5 million tons of ore in 1952, and 2 million tons of ore in 1953. According to the mine manager, Yuan Chaoyun, if the public security situation is good and there are no financial difficulties, this five-year plan can definitely be realized. As for the amount of ore produced by the Tiandu Mine this year, it is expected to be 250,000 tons.

The county magistrate examination was held on the 18th, with 129 participants. It is expected that there will be a large number of transfers of county magistrates in Anhui Province. It is reported that only nine of the 129 participants passed the review.

### Mechanical Officer Luo Zhongzhen Arrested in Wanxian for Carrying Morphine in his Pocket, Attempting to Destroy Evidence

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 21st] Luo Zhongzhen, an air force mechanical officer who studied in the United States, recently requested leave to return to Sichuan from Nanjing. The Wanxian County Government, acting on a confidential report that he was carrying a large amount of morphine, sent a township head to follow him. A large package was found in Luo's pocket. Luo immediately tried to destroy the evidence, resulting in a scuffle. After being arrested, one tael of morphine was still found. Qian Zuoyi, the county magistrate, immediately sent the details and the drugs to Chongqing. On the 21st, the Sui Jing Headquarters received a report from the Chongqing Health Bureau confirming that it was morphine and immediately telegraphed County Magistrate Qian, ordering him to escort Luo to the Fifth Air Force District in Chongqing for interrogation.

### A Complete Picture of Forestry in Taiwan: A Glimmer of Hope Amidst Crisis

— Bo Ying

[Our Tainan Correspondent, 18th Dispatch] Taiwan's forests cover almost the entire island, their verdant lushness a beautiful sight. Indeed, the name "Formosa" (originally meaning "Beautiful Island") originates from this. The reasons for the flourishing of its forests can be attributed to several factors: (1) The towering Mount Yu (formerly known as Mount Niitaka), reaching approximately 3,000 meters in altitude, runs vertically through the island, with its branches crisscrossing east and west, resulting in more mountains than fields, thus facilitating tree growth. (2) Taiwan's steep terrain and intense winds necessitate dense forests to secure the soil, prevent erosion, and mitigate wind damage. (3) The rugged mountainous terrain, with its precipitous ravines and overhanging cliffs, makes human passage inconvenient, further hindering timber transportation, thereby preserving forest accumulation. (4) Taiwan's advantageous geographical conditions straddle both tropical and temperate zones, and considering the overall climate, its high mountains result in cold, warm, temperate, and hot climate zones. For example, during my recent inspection of various forest areas in the west, I visited Mount Ali. While boarding the train in Chiayi in the early morning, it was still the height of summer's sweltering heat, but by evening, I had to huddle around a fire for warmth in the mountains. Mount Ali only stands at an altitude of 2,275 meters. If one were to ascend Mount Yu, exceeding 3,000 meters, it would naturally be even colder. Moreover, the island's location in the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by sea on all sides, provides ample moisture, which is conducive to plant growth and supports a rich variety of tree species. Furthermore, during Japan's 50-year rule over Taiwan, the country leveraged its advanced forestry technology and experience, investing significant capital and actively managing the forests. Consequently, the island's forestry industry became remarkably prosperous, second only to agriculture and industry in Taiwan.

The Evil Wind of Deforestation

Currently, Taiwan's forests can be considered the largest forest region in the entire country. According to the 1937 Taiwan Forestry Statistics, the forest area spans 1,859,000 hectares. The soil in many of these areas is composed of highly erodible slate. Without forests to conserve soil and water, whenever typhoons and torrential rains occur, topsoil is lost, and sand and gravel are carried away by the floods, inundating fields, breaching dikes, and causing considerable damage. For example, the devastating floods in Taichung and Luodong last year were the direct result of the near-complete deforestation of the upstream forests. During my time in Taiwan, I saw slogans everywhere proclaiming "Forests are the lifeblood of Taiwan" and "Without forests, there is no Taiwan." This is not an exaggeration.

The Japanese were originally very conscientious in managing Taiwan's forestry, paying close attention to forest protection and regulation. Forest fires and illegal logging were rare. They were also willing to invest substantial funds in reforestation projects, maintaining a balance between logging and planting, which led to an ideal state of management. However, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to the urgent need for materials, large-scale logging was implemented, and reforestation efforts came to a halt. Subsequently, as the war turned unfavorable, the Japanese, desperate for victory, intensified their deforestation efforts. Even now, a considerable amount of logged timber remains piled up in the mountains, left uncollected and exposed to rain and sun, gradually decaying. After the restoration, the handling of takeover affairs was not ideal, and organizational mergers and personnel maladjustments created obstacles. As a result, the phenomena of deforestation and arson were not only not curbed but also exacerbated. Although the authorities repeatedly issued orders and proclaimed prohibitions, all efforts were in vain. This type of illegal logging is not merely the work of one or two individuals felling a few trees but rather an organized and planned operation with financial and influential backing. There were cases of masterminds behind illegal logging being arrested and sent to court, only to be released on bail shortly afterward, demonstrating their extensive connections. This is indeed the biggest obstacle to Taiwan's forestry today.

During the Japanese occupation, Taiwan's forestry administration was under the jurisdiction of the Forestry Division of the Governor-General's Office of Agriculture and Commerce. The organizational structure was divided into four sections: General Affairs, Forestry Policy, Forest Products, and Forestry Affairs, overseeing all forestry matters throughout Taiwan. After the restoration, the Forestry Bureau under the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Chief Executive Office took over. Now, it has been reorganized into the Forest Products Management Bureau under the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Provincial Government, unifying the functions of forestry management and operational agencies. The Forest Management Offices have also been placed under the jurisdiction of the Forest Products Management Bureau. Under the Forest Products Management Bureau, there are currently six forest areas: Alishan Forest Area, Baxianshan Forest Area, Taipingshan Forest Area, Zhudong Forest Area, Luantashan Forest Area, and Taroko Forest Area. The first three are larger in scale and better equipped, inheriting the larger-scale Japanese government-operated logging operations. I recently visited four forest areas in the west: Alishan, Baxianshan, Zhudong, and Luantashan. Here, I will briefly describe my observations:

The Five Woods of Alishan

Alishan is located in central Taiwan, on a northwestern branch of the Mount Yu Range, situated at 23.5 degrees north latitude, the Tropic of Cancer. It spans eight kilometers east-west and twenty kilometers north-south, covering an area of 10,032 hectares, with an altitude ranging from 924 meters to 2,800 meters. Due to the vertical climate, it possesses four distinct vegetation zones: warm, temperate, cold, and tropical. The timber reserves include: 374,230 coniferous trees, with a volume of 2,952,834 cubic meters; and 1,112,186 broadleaf trees, with a volume of 3,129,978 cubic meters. These are virgin forests that have thrived for thousands of years without being touched by axes. Due to their age, they yield abundant high-quality timber, such as the renowned Five Woods of Alishan: red cypress, Formosan white pine, Taiwan hemlock, Taiwania, and cypress. Among these, cypress is a world-renowned timber. For example, the famous Sacred Tree is a 3,000-year-old red cypress, 53 meters in height and 34.3 meters in circumference (scientific name: Chamaecyparis Formosensis Mats.). (See attached photo.) Countless other trees require several people to encircle them, with diameters at breast height reaching 4.5 meters. The Japanese, enticed by the abundance and quality of the timber, conducted surveys, explorations, and planning, investing a total of 6,090,000 Japanese yen from the 31st year of the Meiji era (1898) to the 44th year of the Meiji era (1911). They constructed a 70-kilometer-long timber railway from Chiayi City, meandering through thousands of mountains and valleys, winding through rugged cliffs. From the foot of the mountain to the summit, it rises approximately 2,300 meters in elevation, with over fifty mountain tunnels along the entire route. According to Mr. Zhang Yufeng, director of the Alishan Mountain Branch of the Forest Area, the longest tunnel is 800 meters long, which gives an idea of the vastness and difficulty of the project. Beside the Alpine Museum on the mountain, we saw a monument to Dr. Kawai Kinsen, a Japanese engineer. It is said to commemorate his death during the inaugural run of the timber railway when he was inspecting the train and was decapitated while leaning out of the train in a tunnel. The log-gathering equipment here uses the American Western aerial cableway method because the trees being harvested are very large, and ordinary methods are not suitable. This method can transport any giant tree within a 2,600-meter radius to a station near the railway for loading onto trains. The forest area still uses this special log-gathering machine (see attached photo), but the future supply of equipment has become a significant issue.

Baxianshan in Fengyuan

Baxianshan is located in Fengyuan, Taichung, spanning 15.7 kilometers east-west and 11.8 kilometers north-south, with an area of 16,422 hectares, larger than Alishan. However, the total timber reserves are only 2,850,815 cubic meters. A 60-kilometer-long timber railway runs from Fengyuan to Jiabao Terrace, and then lumber cars and cableways are used to transport timber further up. The lumber cars are older equipment, and the logging in the old mountain area above is nearly exhausted. This part of the operation will end after August of this year. The cableway leads to the new mountain area, which is a burgeoning logging area. However, the cableway's steel cables used to be replaced every three months, but now they have not been replaced for a year. Therefore, Mr. Meng Chuanlou, director of the Baxianshan Forest Area, has banned passenger cars on the cableway due to concerns about accidents caused by the old cables. However, employees still need to travel up and down for work, so they risk riding on empty lumber cars and riding down on timber, which is even more dangerous. If an accident occurs on the cableway, not only will the employees' lives be unprotected, but repairs will be difficult, and no timber will be able to come down the mountain. Therefore, if this equipment problem is not resolved, not to mention increasing production, it is feared that the operation will soon face a shutdown crisis.

Zhudong Forest Area, etc.

The Zhudong and Luantashan Forest Areas are smaller in scale, and I did not ascend the mountains for inspection. However, I know that the Zhudong Forest Area covers the entire Luchang Mountain and the Xiangshan Mountain, Pulowan, Mayimalai, Tengdana, and Shuitian mountain areas, totaling approximately 11,530 hectares, with timber reserves of approximately 1,050,000 cubic meters. However, Luchang Mountain, the largest area with the richest reserves, was only brought under direct management in April of this year, so everything is still being organized. If the equipment is adequate, transportation tools are increased, and roads and bridges are repaired, then future production can gradually increase to 1,400 cubic meters per month. The Luantashan Forest Area's current operations are limited to Wangxiang Mountain. It is named Luantashan Forest Area in the hope of developing the virgin forests of Greater Luanta in the future. Therefore, the current total forest area is only 150 hectares, and there is only one operating forest section. In 1947, the total volume of virgin forest harvested was 13,000 cubic meters, the volume of timber transported was 8,248 cubic meters, and the volume of timber processed was 4,537 cubic meters. From January to March 1948, the total volume of virgin forest harvested was 1,138 cubic meters, the volume of timber transported was 1,768 cubic meters, and the volume of timber processed was 973 cubic meters.

Impressions After the Visit

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to visit these rare and prominent forest areas in the Far East and conduct on-site inspections. I gained a lot of information and realized that the Japanese had made indelible contributions to the technical aspects of forestry development, which should serve as a wake-up call for us. However, their wartime deforestation, their tolerance of people burning forests, and their destruction caused immense damage to our national vitality and had a profound impact on national land security, which is infuriating. What is even more disheartening is that after the restoration, the Chinese who took over were unable to develop the industry and instead allowed it to deteriorate, which is deeply regrettable. It is undeniable that Taiwan's forestry is facing a severe crisis. Due to over-logging and illegal logging, the nearby forests have been almost completely depleted, and in a few years, they will be gone. Currently, there is only harvesting without reforestation. Every tree cut is one less tree. Conversely, to talk about reforestation, we must first protect the forests, and the primary task of protecting the forests is to reduce and prohibit over-logging and illegal logging. Moreover, the purpose of reforestation is not just timber production; it is primarily to conserve soil and water, replenish water sources, and regulate the climate. However, to achieve "using forests to support forests" without relying on external forces, we must also talk about timber production. Therefore, only by achieving a balance between harvesting and planting can forestry be permanently sustainable. However, due to the damage done in recent years and the current constraints, talking about a balance between harvesting and planting may be premature.

Secondly, there is a shortage of transportation equipment, which has almost reached a dead end. In addition to the situation with the Baxianshan cableway mentioned above, for example, many of the rails on the Alishan railway have been worn down on one side, and many bridges and tunnels have deteriorated. Of the forty locomotives, only six are usable, and all of them are over thirty years old. Currently, there is no possibility of replacing them, and even a complete overhaul would be too expensive. Now, we can only treat the symptoms as they arise and repair the most essential parts first. As a result, the reduced transportation capacity has hindered production and contributed to the decline of forestry.

In addition to these problems, the undesirable practices brought from the mainland have gradually spread in Taiwan. For example, internal personnel disputes in the forest areas have become increasingly complex, affecting the handling of official business and administrative efficiency. A clear example of this is the recent resignation of Mr. Fu Xian, director of the Alishan Forest Area, due to his inability to cope with the obstruction of his subordinates. (See the August 2nd issue of the Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily News.)

The First Glimmer of Dawn

Although forestry is currently facing numerous difficulties and a bleak future, human effort can make a difference. Seeing this, the responsible officials of Taiwan's forestry agencies are striving to reverse the decline, giving a glimmer of hope to the future of forestry, which is commendable. Furthermore, the local press is keenly aware of the critical importance of the forestry industry to Taiwan's lifeline and is raising timely appeals, which is encouraging. For example, while I was at Jiabao Terrace in Baxianshan, I happened to meet a Taipei press delegation visiting the forestry area. When I returned from my tour in the south, the Taipei newspapers had already published reports on the forestry visit, which were generally accurate in identifying the current problems and revealing the root causes of the difficulties in forestry. It is hoped that this will draw the attention of the public and lead to a collective effort to solve the problems and restore the prosperity of forestry. This will not only benefit the six million people of Taiwan but also serve the long-term interests of the nation. It is indeed a matter of urgency.

### National Tax Bureau Downsizes, Stirring Trouble

[Our Wujin Correspondent, 19th Dispatch] The Direct Commodity and Business Tax Bureau of this county was merged into the National Tax Bureau, with Sun Mingxiu, the former director of the Commodity Tax Bureau, as the director. After Sun took office, he laid off a large number of personnel from the former Business Tax Bureau, which lacked fairness and reasonableness, arousing resentment among some of the laid-off employees. They repeatedly asked the director to explain the criteria for retention and dismissal, but to no avail. On the 19th, a large number of inflammatory slogans suddenly appeared in the Tieshi Lane area of the bureau. Director Sun immediately reported the matter to the city defense department and hired photographers to take numerous photos. Meanwhile, the laid-off employees' association declared that the slogans were entirely the result of a conspiracy, hoping to divert attention and evade responsibility.

### Consignment Clerk Fan Huasheng Reports Loss of Leather Suitcase; Source Unclear, Detained for Investigation

[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 19th Dispatch] At around 5:00 a.m. on the 19th, freight train No. 508, which departed from Shanghai, lost a box of foreign cosmetics being transported to the Sanyou Research Institute in Qiaotou Town, Zhenjiang, by the Shanghai Wanguo Transportation Company, due to bumps and vibrations near Waikuatang. Upon arrival at Suzhou Station, Fan Huasheng, the consignment clerk of the train, immediately requested assistance from the railway police section to search for it. Later, the road police accompanied him to the area and found a large American-style leather suitcase in a nearby field. When they brought it back and opened it, the suitcase was filled with cosmetics. In the bottom layer, there were also two wooden antique basins inscribed with the words "Made in the Qianlong Reign of the Great Qing Dynasty." They were purplish-red in color and intricately carved with figures. However, as the source of the suitcase was unclear, the railway police authorities temporarily detained it for investigation.

### Shocking Murder Case in Lanzhou: Fugitive Arrested; Wang Wenxuan and His Four Brothers Stabbed; One Dead, Two Injured; Bizarre Details

[Our Lanzhou Correspondent, 19th Dispatch] At around 11:00 p.m. on the 8th of this month, on a rainy, dimly lit night, a shocking murder case occurred at No. 212 Zuogong East Road in Lanzhou, resulting in one death and three injuries. The murderer escaped over the wall after committing the crime. After more than a week of investigation by the criminal police team, he was finally apprehended on the 15th. The details are as follows:

Wang Wenxuan, a Shanxi native, worked as a driver in the air force in Kunming during the Anti-Japanese War, where he met You Shoufang, a soldier from Luoyang, Henan. During the golden age of the Burma Road, Wang accumulated some savings and bought two trucks to transport goods in the southwest. His third brother, Wang Wenyi, and fourth brother, Wang Wenzhao, also worked as truck drivers. Two years ago, Wang Wenxuan's family moved to Xi'an, where You Shoufang was also stationed. The two remained on good terms. Recently, Wang Wenxuan's family came to Lanzhou to run a transportation company, and You Shoufang followed them to Lanzhou. Initially, he stayed at Wang's home, but at the beginning of this month, he moved to a certain hotel. At around 10:00 p.m. on the 8th of this month, You Shoufang went to Wang's home again and chatted with Wenxuan over tea. An hour later, Wang Wenxuan went to the toilet to urinate. You Shoufang suddenly jumped out from behind and repeatedly stabbed him with a triangular scraper used for repairing cars. Wenxuan shouted for help! His fourth brother, Wenli, came out to investigate after hearing the noise and was met by You with a knife that struck him in the left chest, causing him to collapse to the ground. The third brother, Wenyi, and the second brother, Wenzhong, rushed to rescue him but were also stabbed. After 12:00 a.m., Wang Wenyi's son, Niansheng, called the police. The police rushed the injured to a nearby hospital for emergency treatment. At 3:00 a.m. on the 9th, Wang Wenli died of his injuries, as the knife had pierced his heart. Wang Wenxuan was stabbed in seven places on his chest and back and was also in a coma for a time. The other two had three to five stab wounds each, but they were not in critical areas and were not in life-threatening danger.

The deceased, Wang Wenli, was originally scheduled to get married on the 15th of this month. Unfortunately, he met with a sudden and tragic death and was buried on the 11th. However, the reason for You Shoufang's actions is widely speculated, but the mystery has not been solved. The local security authorities have ordered the criminal police team to solve the case within a week. Detectives were dispatched everywhere, but there were still no results as of the evening of the 14th.

At 3:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month, the murderer, You Shoufang, was finally arrested by the criminal police team at No. 21 Yanshou Lane. It is said that he was almost able to escape. The reporter visited this "murderous demon" at the criminal police team at 7:00 p.m. that day, but You Shoufang looked like a student, wearing a yellow khaki shirt, with a dark complexion and a neat appearance. He only looked dejected and showed no signs of ferocity. According to his confession to the criminal police team, the motive for his actions was that when he and Wang Wenxuan were in Xi'an, Wang entrusted him to take care of his wife, Hu Qizhen. However, Wang then had a close relationship with a Chen woman who ran a pharmacy. Wang Wenxuan originally planned to take over Chen's pharmacy and divorce his wife, Hu Qizhen. He also asked his old supervisor, Zheng Paifu, to tell You Shoufang that he would abandon Hu Qizhen and remarry her to You Shoufang. You initially felt that it was against his principles and did not agree, but later Hu Qizhen had no means of support, so You provided her with assistance. The two began living together informally.

At the beginning of this year, Wang Wenxuan's relationship with the Chen woman deteriorated, and his plan to take over the pharmacy failed. So, he returned to Hu Qizhen and came to Lanzhou together. Out of anger, You followed them to Lanzhou, but he did not quarrel with Wang and the others. You Shoufang recently lost his job and was struggling financially. He even stayed in Wang's garage for a time and asked Wang's brothers to help him find a job. Seeing You's destitution, the Wang family changed their previously warm attitude. You became angry and moved out.

The Wang brothers not only did not help You find a job, but they also threatened to throw him into a well. On the night of the 8th, You Shoufang came to Wang's home in the rain to ask for help finding a job. They quarreled, and You finally felt that Wang Wenxuan was too ungrateful, so he decided to hurt Wang Wenxuan. After one stab, the Wang brothers came to his rescue one after another. You Shoufang was afraid that they would be unfavorable to him, so he stabbed all four of them. After the incident, You fled the city at night and hid in Shuibu River in Gaolan North Township. He came into the city to listen to the news on the 15th and was immediately arrested. The police have now transferred the suspect and the murder weapon to the local court, and a public prosecution will be initiated within days.

### Purpose and Means — A Word for Those Who Disregard Means —

Political struggles are often not struggles between purpose and purpose, but merely struggles between means and means. Political victory is also often not a victory of purpose itself, but merely a victory of means itself; "The victor is king, the vanquished is bandit." This success or failure determines whether someone is king or bandit, but a person's purpose need not be to aim to be a bandit. What drives someone to success or failure often lies not in their purpose, but in their means. In terms of purpose, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu's purposes may not have been different, both could be said to have aimed to resist the tyrannical Qin! At the very least, that was their slogan. However, Liu Bang succeeded and Xiang Yu failed because their means were different. One entered the pass and did not disturb the chickens or dogs, and did not commit the slightest offense; the other buried Qin soldiers and burned Xianyang. This benevolence or violence in means, coupled with intelligence or stupidity in means, was the main cause of Liu and Xiang's success or failure. The history of success and failure of all emperors and other political fighters in our history can mostly be viewed in this way. This is the most obvious fact in history, and there is no need to say more.

What does this obvious fact tell us? What lessons can we learn from this fact? The first lesson is that the end does not justify the means. The righteousness of the end does not equate to the righteousness of the means, which is common knowledge and beyond doubt. Can using unjust means to achieve a just end make the unjust means just? That is the question. In fact, we often use unjust means to achieve just ends. We often use deception to entice children to take medicine, and we also often use deception to interrogate criminals and make them confess. We sympathize with those who kill for revenge. We not only sympathize with soldiers who kill and deceive while fighting the enemy, but also praise them. There are countless similar acts. Does this not mean that if the end is just, the means become just as well? As for those who advocate "only care about the end, regardless of the means": this may be their theoretical basis. However, this theoretical basis is not strong. Firstly, we do not recognize the above examples as common practice, that is, we do not recognize that the above means can be universally applied. We only recognize that in certain special circumstances, the above means are permissible. Secondly, in special circumstances, although we allow the above means, we do not regard the above means as just. In order to induce children to take medicine or to induce criminals to confess, we allow the use of deception, but we still condemn this means itself. We will never sympathize with this means itself. What we sympathize with is the end, not the means. The law does not allow killing for revenge, and that is why. Modern people regard war itself as illegal, and that is also why. It can be seen that a just end does not make the means just. This is the case in any situation. In any situation, the end cannot make the means just. Unjust means are always unjust means, and do not become just because of their relationship with a just end. The righteousness or injustice of an act has another standard, and cannot be determined solely by the end. If the righteousness or injustice of an act is determined solely by the end, not only are human ends latent and difficult to know, making judgment difficult, but even if they are known, the distinction between just and unjust will disappear completely. If theft is aimed at survival, we cannot say that "seeking survival" is an unjust end. Does the act of theft also become just along with this end? If the means become just along with the end, then there may be no unjust means in the world.

The second lesson is that unjust means can destroy a just end. The end cannot make the means just, but when the means are unjust, the end is often affected. We all know that the end is latent, hidden deep within the human heart. Modern science excludes the concept of "end" because this concept is obscure and difficult to experience. We cannot directly perceive someone's end, we can only measure their end through their actions and means. This measurement can of course be wrong, so unjust means do not necessarily reflect an unjust end. However, apart from this method of measurement and inference, we have no other way to directly know the ends of others. Expressions of ends in language and writing do not necessarily express the inner ends of someone. This can be faked. Conversely, the use of means or the expression of actions can better reflect someone's inner ends. Therefore, when someone's means are unjust, we suspect that their ends are also unjust. This is very natural and also has a basis. If we have a just end, we must not use unjust means, otherwise our end can easily be mistaken for unjust, and it will be difficult for us to prove that it is just. Secondly, unjust means can sometimes achieve just ends, but they often destroy just ends. There are many such examples. For example, filial piety to parents is certainly a just end. But if theft is used as a means, it will usually destroy this end. Another example is patriotism, or increasing the glory of the nation, which is an end that we consider just. Under this end, the use of unjust means is usually permitted by us. But didn't the deceptive and aggressive means used by dictators and militarists in countries such as Germany and Japan destroy their ends? According to the current situation, even in dealings between countries, unjust means cannot be used to achieve so-called just ends. The behavior of deception and aggression will eventually bear its own fruit.

The third lesson is that in politics, it is only possible to win through means, and it is difficult to win through ends. This does not deny the importance of ends. Ends are certainly important in politics. We certainly need to have lofty and just ends. However, political struggles are rarely struggles between ends and ends. At the very least, on the surface, the ends proposed by each other are rarely conflicting. Taking dictatorship and democracy as examples, they are undoubtedly two extremely opposite political systems, but the difference lies not in their public ends. In terms of public ends, dictators must believe that their ends are the same as those of democracy, that is, to seek the welfare of the people. Of course, we can deny that the dictator's ends are not like this, but the basis for our denial is the means used by the dictator. We say that their ends are not democratic because the means used by the dictator are undemocratic. When dictators use deception and oppression of the people as means, we cannot believe their so-called end of "seeking the welfare of the people." In this way, the failure of dictators, regardless of their ends, is actually a failure of means. Therefore, the British scholar Ernest Barker believes that the difference between democracy and dictatorship lies mainly in the means and not in the end. Free democracy is "more concerned with the method of government than with its purpose - more concerned with the process of government than with its goal." It is generally believed that politics is playing tricks with means. In a sense, this is true. But the only condition is that we have to play just means, and we cannot play unjust means. Playing unjust means, even if it can achieve temporary victory, will eventually fail. The tragedy of politics can be said to be the tragedy of neglecting means, the tragedy of neglecting that means must be just and only seeking that the end is just.

The above three lessons are very obvious. The reason why the author specifically raises them here is because people currently engaged in political activities in our country neglect means too much. They are always engaged in political struggles under the false principle of "only caring about the end, regardless of the means." Their ends may be just, but their means are often unjust. In order to achieve a certain end, they can collude with groups that betray the interests of the country and the nation, they can also contact bandits and robbers, and they can cooperate with vile politicians or warlords. In short, they will use any of the most unjust means. They seem to aim to achieve democracy, but they use the most undemocratic means. They seem to aim at the welfare of the people, but they only use the people as tools and means. They have forgotten the famous saying of the German philosopher Kant - that is, "Treat humanity, in any case, as an end, and never merely as a means." This famous saying is actually the element of democratic politics. They do not know that if they do not choose means, the people can also become a means. Once they use the people as a means, they destroy their own end and destroy the spirit of democratic politics. Democratic politics never allows the people to be used only as a means. Everything can be only a means, but humanity itself cannot be only a means. If humanity is only used as a means, then there is no way to talk about the so-called end. But "not choosing means" will inevitably lead to using humanity as a means. In this way, all evils are done under the principle of "not exploring means." The chaos in the current situation in China is the responsibility of these people who talk glibly about democracy but do not choose means. History teaches that those who do not choose means will always fail. This is what the author cannot help but say to warn them.

### Joint Meeting of Silver and Money Industries Sets Internal Precautions for Firms: All Assets and Transactions Calculated in Gold Yuan; Starting September 1st, Legal Tender Checks Will No Longer Be Accepted

[Special Dispatch] After the government implemented currency reform, regarding the precautions that should be taken in banking operations, in addition to the National Bank having already drafted concise guidelines and notified the financial industry in this city on the 20th to review and implement, the financial industry believes that there is a need for more detailed regulations on various technical issues involved in internal and external dealings within these concise guidelines. A joint meeting of the silver, money, and trust industries was convened at the Bankers Association yesterday morning starting at 10:00 AM, presided over by Li Fuxun, Chairman of the Bankers Association, attended by more than 30 people including Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhixin, and Xu Jilun. As a result of the discussion, nine "Internal Precautions for Banks Regarding Currency Reform" were passed to supplement the shortcomings of the concise guidelines set by the National Bank. These precautions have been distributed to member firms of each association for review and consistent implementation. The full text of the "Internal Precautions for Banks Regarding Currency Reform" is provided below:

(1) As of August 20, 1948, all bank claims, debts, and accounting balances shall be calculated at a rate of 3,000,000 Legal Tender to 1 Gold Yuan.

(2) For accounting convenience, assets such as bank capital, reserve funds, real estate, and marketable securities shall also be temporarily converted into Gold Yuan at the same ratio. Adjustments will be made after separate measures are drafted and approved by the government.

(3) When converting amounts in account books and passbooks, the rubber stamp "Converted to Gold Yuan at the Legal Rate" shall be used.

(4) Legal Tender instruments issued before August 31, 1948, that are entrusted to banks for collection by customers, shall be stamped by the collecting bank with a horizontal rubber stamp "Converted to Gold Yuan," indicating the Arabic Gold Yuan amount, and submitted for exchange. Starting September 1st, checks issued by customers that are still denominated in Legal Tender will no longer be accepted. Those seeking to cash checks at the paying bank should be asked to exchange them for Gold Yuan checks before payment can be made. (This measure slightly modifies Item 4, Section A of the Central Bank's Telegraphic Circular No. 3013, and will be filed with the Central Bank and publicly announced in the newspapers.) The rubber stamp mentioned above should be applied below the amount on Chinese checks and above the Arabic numerals on English checks.

(5) Remittance advices and receipts (both original and duplicate) that should have been sent before August 20 but have not yet been issued shall be sent by the paying bank after first converting the amount to Gold Yuan at the specified ratio.

(6) Current deposits and overdrafts shall be settled at the interest rates announced by the Bankers Association on August 19 before August 20. (Deposit interest rate: 2.3 yuan per thousand; overdraft interest rate: 14 yuan per thousand; interbank day loan rate: 12 yuan per thousand.) Fixed deposit interest rates shall continue to be calculated according to the original agreement. Deposits with semi-annual interest payments shall be calculated at the original agreed interest rate before August 20. Subsequent interest rates shall be determined by each bank.

(7) Pre-war deposits in banks that have not yet been entered into the accounts according to the settlement regulations shall be temporarily converted into Gold Yuan at a rate of 3 million to 1 based on the original Legal Tender amount. However, the original currency amount must be noted in the remarks column, and amounts less than one Gold Yuan cent after conversion shall also be counted as one cent. When depositors come to claim their deposits, they will still be converted and repaid according to the settlement regulations based on the original Legal Tender account books.

(8) Unused checks issued by banks in the future that are printed with the words "National Currency" should have the words "Gold Yuan" stamped immediately below the words "National Currency." Customers who write checks must also add the words "Gold Yuan" below "National Currency" and must not write the words "Gold Yuan" next to "National Currency" or cross out "National Currency." If this type of writing exists, the original seal should be used to certify it. (This point concerning customers should be announced separately.)

(9) New contracts or documents issued by banks to customers that require stamp duties should still use Legal Tender stamp tax tickets, converted to Gold Yuan at the specified ratio, before the tax bureau makes any changes.

### National Bank Notifies Designated Banks of New Foreign Exchange Settlement Regulations: Export Settlements Will No Longer Issue Settlement Certificates

The National Bank yesterday issued Circular No. 152 to all designated banks, stipulating the new foreign exchange settlement regulations after the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy, as follows:

(1) When exporters, etc., sell foreign exchange through designated banks, the National Bank may pay the entire amount in Gold Yuan at the statutory exchange rate of 4 Gold Yuan per US dollar, and will no longer issue foreign exchange settlement certificates.

(2) Importers, etc., who have obtained import licenses and are approved to purchase foreign exchange and have already obtained foreign exchange settlement certificates may purchase foreign exchange by submitting the foreign exchange settlement certificates and simultaneously paying 474,000 National Currency or 0.158 Gold Yuan.

(3) Importers, etc., who have obtained import licenses and are approved to purchase foreign exchange may purchase foreign exchange at a ratio of 4 Gold Yuan per US dollar without having to submit foreign exchange settlement certificates.

(4) Except for the above three items, designated banks must calculate all other foreign exchange transactions according to the new exchange rate for US dollars.

(5) All circulars previously issued by the National Bank that conflict with this circular shall be invalid.

### Central Bank Sets Foreign Exchange Balance Rates

In order to adapt to the new measures, the Central Bank has specially set the exchange rate for clearing daily foreign exchange balances and has notified all designated banks to comply with Circular No. 153 yesterday. The text is as follows:

Since the President issued new economic measures and issued Gold Yuan notes, the Central Bank is authorized to settle foreign exchange at the following exchange rates:

US$1 equals 4 Gold Yuan. £1 equals 12 Gold Yuan. HK$1 equals 0.75 Gold Yuan. 1 Indian Rupee equals 0.9 Gold Yuan.

Foreign exchange balances should be cleared after the end of business hours each day. All foreign exchange other than US dollars and British pounds should be converted into US dollars or British pounds for settlement. To unify the conversion, the exchange rates for each foreign exchange are as follows:

HK$1 equals 1 shilling 3 pence. 1 Indian Rupee equals 1 shilling 6 pence. 1 Burmese Rupee equals 2 shillings 6 pence. 4 Swiss Francs equal US$1. 2 Philippine Pesos equal US$1. C$1 equals US$1. 11 Dutch Guilders equal £1.

The Bank's previous Circulars No. 6 and No. 138 should be cancelled.

### Stock Exchange Resumption: No Definite Date Yet

[Special Dispatch] After the issuance of the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy, the stock exchange in this city immediately suspended operations in accordance with the order. The date of resumption is still awaiting official instructions from the Executive Yuan. According to a spokesman for the stock exchange yesterday, Guanlan, the date is not expected to be far off. Regarding the settlement of transactions that have already been made, the key personnel of the exchange conducted a thorough study yesterday afternoon and decided on a plan, which will be submitted to the Standing Committee meeting of the exchange today for approval and then publicly announced for implementation.

### National Bank Decides to Open Remittances Nationwide

[Special Dispatch] After the currency system reform, the Central Bank has decided to open remittances to all parts of the country. The Northeast region is still working on a separate plan due to the excessive amount of speculative capital. The internal remittance rate and deposit and loan interest rates have also been decided to be adjusted and will be gradually reduced based on local price levels, in order to unify prices in all parts of the country in the short term.

### Foreign Exchange for Gold Yuan Reserve Partially Transferred to Issuing Bureau; Central Printing Factory Ceases Printing Operations

[Special Dispatch] According to Deputy Director Chen Yanzuo of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, the current amount of Gold Yuan is sufficient for the current needs of the entire country. It has been decided to stop the printing of banknotes at the Central Printing Factory from today, and the contract with the foreign banknote printing company will also be terminated. In the future, when the Issuing Bureau increases the issuance of Gold Yuan, the Business Bureau will first submit the reserve funds, which will be received by the Issuing Bureau before issuing banknotes. This procedure will ensure the stability of the currency value.

The gold, silver, and foreign currency currently held by the Central Bank have been partially transferred to the Issuing Bureau. The Ministry of Finance is also studying the method of transferring the remaining marketable securities used as issuance reserves.

The Supervisory Committee will be established in Shanghai within days. In the future, the Director of the Issuing Bureau will be responsible to the members of the committee and will conduct a supervisory investigation of the amount issued and the reserves at the end of each month, which will be announced at the end of the following month.

### National Bank Allocates Funds as Needed by Banks

After the implementation of the new economic measures, the government has decided to gradually reduce interest rates and exchange rates to stabilize prices and is studying methods. Regarding the issue of internal remittances, the Central Bank held a meeting on the 20th and made the following decisions: (1) The Central Bank will remove all restrictions on the allocation of funds to banks, but will handle it at its discretion depending on the amount of funds. (2) Separate measures will be formulated for the Northeast circulation notes. (3) It is recommended that the Ministry of Finance abolish the restrictions on Shanghai remittances and South China remittances.

### Wang Zhixin Will Go to Beijing Again to Request Instructions on Stock Exchange Resumption

After the issuance of the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy, the Shanghai Stock Exchange immediately suspended operations in compliance with the order. Wang Zhixin, the Acting General Manager of the Exchange, went to Beijing on the 20th and met with the Ministers of Finance and Industry and Commerce. The authorities stated that the government issued the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy this time to prevent drastic fluctuations in the market, so it ordered the stock exchange to temporarily suspend operations. Wang Zhixin personally stated the importance of the stock exchange in financial institutions and that it should be reopened as soon as possible. In the future, when the government issues Gold Yuan bonds, state-owned enterprises issue stocks, and private enterprises need construction, there will be many places where the stock exchange is needed. After the currency system reform, the currency value is stable, and the speculative component can be reduced, and the stock exchange business will naturally be more legitimate, and the future development can be expected. It is reported that Wang Zhixin will go to Beijing again within days to report on his work to the two ministers and ask the Executive Yuan for instructions on the resumption plan.

Public Bonds

Yesterday, there were tens of thousands of small transactions outside the exchange, all denominated in Gold Yuan. Among them, the current settlement of Class C bonds rose from 1 yuan to close at 1.5 yuan. Settlement the day after tomorrow, next Monday, requires about 1.65 yuan. Class A, B, D, and E bonds are all for settlement next Monday, with Class A and B at 1.4 yuan, Class D at 1.45 yuan, and Class E at 1.5 yuan, all up about half a cent compared to the previous day.

### National Bank Open for Business Today as Usual

To cope with the opening of various firms on the 23rd, the National Bank is still working as usual today, a regular Sunday holiday.

### Export Control Committee Studies Revisions to Export Control Measures

After the implementation of the new economic measures, export and import management issues have been greatly affected. It is reported that the export control measures will be revised, and the responsible departments of the Export Control Committee are studying them in detail based on the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy. If there are any conflicts with the Emergency Measures Decree, the Committee will revise them and then form a whole new plan after the revision opinions of each responsible department are collected. Therefore, all laws and regulations of the Committee in the past will be reviewed again this time, so that they can be coordinated with the new measures, take into account the facts, and be implemented smoothly, and ensure that no problems will occur in the future. The heads of the Committee held a meeting yesterday morning to exchange views. It is reported that according to the provisions of the Emergency Measures Decree, the fifth and sixth quarters will still be handled as before. Starting from the seventh quarter, the import quota will be reduced by one-quarter. Addendum Table (1) (3) allows the import of foreign exchange prepared by oneself, so the revised part of the Committee focuses on Addendum Table (1) (3). After the revised articles are sorted out, they will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is estimated that it will take two weeks to resolve. During this transition period, the Committee's handling principle is (1) those that do not conflict with the Emergency Measures Decree will be handled as before. (2) Those that conflict with the Emergency Measures Decree will be handled after the Executive Yuan approves them. In addition, the measures for investment by overseas Chinese should also be supplemented and revised due to the implementation of the new economic plan, and it will be difficult to announce them in the short term.

### Treasury Bonds Temporarily Suspended from Sale

The short-term treasury bills issued by the Central Bank under order will be temporarily suspended from sale after the implementation of the economic measures. Whether to list the treasury bills and sell treasury bills at the counter will be decided based on future market conditions.

### National Bank Receives and Exchanges Foreign Currencies; Special Accounts Can Be Opened for Storage

Materials Can Only Be Purchased with Permission

The Gold Yuan will begin circulating in the market tomorrow, and the old currency will be exchanged at the same time. The Central Bank will not temporarily entrust other banks to handle the exchange. If those who exchange foreign currency wish to import materials, they can open a special account for storage, but it can only be used with a permit; otherwise, it will still be exchanged for Gold Yuan according to regulations.

### Sichuan Prices Continue to Rise

[Chengdu, Sichuan, Dispatch of the 21st] The city market has not yet opened, and prices have risen wildly on the 20th and 21st, especially for general necessities, which have risen by an average of two times. The textile, cotton yarn, and department store industries have been closed for three days. Rice is 54 million per double stone, and there is no transaction in various goods. According to authoritative observations, Sichuan prices will rise to be the same as Beijing and Shanghai before stabilizing.

### Woolen Trading Stalled

The wholesale trading of woolen goods on Friday, the day before yesterday, has temporarily stopped in the major wholesale houses and chess board street teahouses. Most people in the industry predict that the market will continue to decline, and it is expected that silver will become tight in the next ten days, and those with high-interest loans will inevitably be forced to cut their goods.

### National Banks and Bureaus Reduce Interest Rates; Monthly Loan Interest Rates Not to Exceed Three Cents

[Special Dispatch] In order to reduce the interest rates of national banks and bureaus, the Central Bank convened a meeting of responsible personnel of national banks and bureaus yesterday afternoon. Yu Hongjun personally presided over the meeting, and Xu Boyuan, Liu Gongyun, Song Hanzhang, Li Shuming, Xi Demao, Qian Xinzhi, Zhao Dihua, Cheng Yuanfan, Shou Miancheng, and others participated. It was decided to adjust the various interest rates as follows:

(1) The National Bank's daily loan interest rate is 0.25 cents.

(2) The monthly loan interest rate of national banks and bureaus shall not exceed 2 cents.

(3) The National Bank's rediscount rate is 2.4 cents per month.

(4) The interest rate on interbank deposits (including deposit reserves) and national bank and bureau deposits is set at 2 cents per month.

(5) Regarding the deposit and loan interest rates of commercial banks, it was decided that the Ministry of Finance would supervise and gradually handle them in accordance with the interest rate policy of the national banks and bureaus. The original interest rate control regulations will be implemented slowly, that is, the Central Bank will not temporarily approve the interest rates of commercial banks.

### Commercial Banks Present Demands

After the meeting of responsible persons of national banks and bureaus ended at 6:00 PM, Yu Hongjun immediately convened a meeting of responsible persons of commercial banks. Yu announced the results of the reduction in interest rates of national banks and bureaus, and then the discussion began.

Li Ming, Chairman of the Bankers Association, expressed his opinion, hoping that the interest rates of commercial banks could be gradually reduced to be close to those of national banks and bureaus, but hoped that the authorities would take into account the daily expenses of the banks when implementing this policy. At the same time, if the loan interest rate is too low, applicants for loans will make it impossible for the banks to cope.

As a result of the discussion, representatives of commercial banks put forward the following requirements: (1) In the future, deposit reserves can be paid with US dollar bonds. (2) The proportion of deposit reserves should be reduced, because the amount of chips has been greatly reduced after the currency system reform. (3) The National Bank should provide various assistance to commercial banks when necessary. (4) The balance of the National Bank's acceptance of the banks' obligations should be converted into Gold Yuan today (the 22nd) in order to meet the needs of customers on Monday.

Except for points (1) and (2), which need to be taken to Beijing by Vice Minister Xu Boyuan to request instructions from the Ministry of Finance, the remaining points were approved by President Yu. The meeting then ended at around 7:00 PM.

### Rice Rationing Method to be Considered; President Li Stays in Beijing to Continue Discussions

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhu Jingnong, President of the private Guanghua University, and Li Shouyong, President of the National Jinan University, recently went to Beijing to meet with Minister Guan Jiyu of the Ministry of Food, representing various public and private colleges and universities in the city, to discuss preferential rice rationing for students. They requested two points: (1) That the rice rationed to students continue to be sold at half the price of ordinary rice rationing. (2) That once the price is set, it remains stable for the entire semester. Because the two presidents went to Beijing just as the government announced a new economic plan to reform the currency system, Minister Guan stated that all measures were still under discussion. The first request was to be considered, and the second request was not an issue because the price of rice would stabilize due to the currency reform. President Zhu, due to pending school affairs in Shanghai, returned to Shanghai yesterday. President Li remains in Beijing to continue negotiations.

### World Games Basketball Team; Defeated by Philippine Islands Team

— Special Correspondent Zhong of Our Newspaper

[Our Newspaper, London Airmail] Our country's World Games basketball team has fought fiercely so far, with two wins and three losses. Today (August 4th) at 7:00 PM, the match against the Philippine Islands team at the Haringey Arena was truly a crucial moment for our team. However, due to continuous battles over the past few days, the physical strength of the players was exhausted, and their performance became abnormal. As a result, they were defeated by the Philippine Islands team with a score of 37 to 51. The hard work of the previous two days was completely wasted, which is regrettable. Many Chinese spectators came to support the team, and Chinese naval students practicing in England also organized a cheering squad to cheer on the team, creating an unprecedented scene. The match results are recorded below:

(Yu Ruizhang) Huang Tianxi

Wu Chengzhang (Jia Zhijun) (Li Zhenzhong)

Li Shiqiao Cai Wenhua Bao Songyuan

### Philippine Islands Tactics; Entirely American Style

This match was also a life-or-death battle for the Philippine Islands team. Therefore, as soon as the game started, they attacked with all their might, quickly scoring a goal to take the lead with 2 to 0. Under strict surveillance, the two guards acted a little rudely, committing numerous fouls several times when our team was shooting, but for some reason, our players only made one goal out of four free throws today, which was the biggest cause of the failure. After that, the entire game was controlled by the Philippine Islands team, and our team was unable to resist. The tactics of the Philippine Islands team this time completely imitated the American style, using extremely short passes to transmit quickly. They never shot until they were 80 or 90 percent sure. Their center's skills were superb. Once the ball reached his hand, he would definitely score. In addition, the two guards were quite tall and marked people very tightly, so the performance was indeed very exciting. They quickly led with 10 to 4. Although our team also resisted with all their might, they were ultimately unable to take the lead. Bao Songyuan played very hard in this match, but unfortunately Cai Wenhua, for some reason, missed all three shots, and a good opportunity was lost. Although they once approached with a score of 10 to 8, they were quickly outscored by the Philippine Islands team with three quick goals in a ghostly manner, leading by a score of 16 to 8. In the subsequent battle, our team only scored a few points from free throws. At halftime, the score was 27 to 14, a difference of 13 points. During the break, spectators predicted that the Chinese team was doomed and would definitely lose today.

### The Situation is Gone; All Previous Efforts are Wasted

In the second half, Coach Song adjusted the lineup, replacing Bao Songyuan with Li Zhenzhong. After the kickoff, Li Shiqiao immediately leaped up and threw the ball in with one hand, his posture being extremely perfect, earning a lot of applause from the audience. After that, although our team had many opportunities to get the ball, the forwards could not do anything under the close marking of the Philippine Islands team. On the contrary, that team used a calm and sure shot, further increasing the lead with a score of 31 to 17. At this time, Cai Wenhua was completely exhausted and was replaced by Jia Zhijun. In the meantime, Yu Ruizhang was replaced by Wu Chengzhang, and the situation became even more one-sided, with a score of 39 to 23. At this time, there were only ten minutes left in the game, and the coach immediately called in the original lineup from the beginning to make a desperate gamble. The Philippine Islands team also knew our strategy at this time and resisted with all their strength. The battle between the two sides was extremely exciting, but in the end, the difference in strength was too great, and the players' energy became increasingly exhausted. Under the gradual pressure of 41 to 25 and 47 to 27, our team was completely defeated. Although Wu Chengzhang scored several goals, it was in vain. In the end, the Philippine Islands team defeated the Chinese team with a score of 51 to 32.

In this game, it can be seen that long-range shots and long passes are no longer popular in the current new-style tactics. After gaining this experience in the World Games, the Chinese team can improve in the future. However, the lack of physical strength in our country is the biggest reason for repeated failures. It is commendable that our basketball team was able to win several times with their best efforts this time.

### Our World Games Football Team; Beats Siam Team Six to One

### The Death of Mr. Zhu Ziqing (Part 1)

— Xie Bingying

Since seeing the news about Mr. Zhu Ziqing's hospitalization for gastric ulcer treatment at Peking Union Medical College Hospital on August 8th, I had intended to visit him. However, I was also ill at the time, and I thought that I shouldn't disturb him when he was seriously ill. I knew that hospitals often refuse visits from people other than close relatives to those suffering from serious illnesses. Who knew that this thought was wrong; from then on, I would never have the opportunity to see Mr. Ziqing again!

There is no need for an introduction. Everyone who has read Mr. Ziqing's "Back View" in middle school Chinese textbooks knows how fluent, light, and profoundly meaningful Mr. Ziqing's articles are. From the publication of "Traces" in 1924 to today, he has dedicated himself to literary work for a full twenty-six years. If we start counting from when he began writing, it has been more than thirty years. He was a writer who earnestly researched academics and patiently encouraged young people. He served as a professor at Tsinghua University from August 1925 to this year, a full twenty-three years. Everyone who received his education knows his unique character: whether teaching or grading papers, he was very serious and not at all careless. He was never late or early for class, and he took attendance every class. Although he was so strict, no students disliked or resented him. The reason is that he had kindness and sincerity in his solemnity, which greatly moved young people.

Mr. Ziqing's alias was Peixian, and he used the pen names "Zhibai," "Baihui," and "Baishui." He was born on the ninth day of the tenth lunar month in the year of Wuxu in the Guangxu reign (1898) in Jiangdu, Jiangsu Province, and his ancestral home was Shaoxing, Zhejiang. In 1920, he graduated from the Department of Philosophy of the Faculty of Arts at National Peking University. In August of the same year, he served as a Chinese teacher at the First Normal School of Zhejiang Province in Hangzhou; from August to September 1920, he served as a Chinese teacher at the Eighth Middle School of Jiangsu Province in Yangzhou; from February to July 1921, he served as a Chinese teacher at the Sixth Normal School of Zhejiang Province in Taizhou; from September to October 1921, he served as a Chinese teacher in the middle school department of China Public School in Wusong; from July 1922 to January 1924, he served as a Chinese teacher at the Sixth Normal School and the Tenth Middle School of Zhejiang Province in Wenzhou; from February 1924 to July 1925, he served as a Chinese teacher at the Fourth Middle School of Zhejiang Province in Ningbo and concurrently as a Chinese teacher at Chunhui Middle School in Baima Lake, Shangyu; from August 1925 to the present, he has served as a professor in the Department of Chinese at Tsinghua University. (Editor's note: Mr. Peixian is the head of the Department of Chinese Literature at Tsinghua University.)

As for his published works, there are the following fifteen kinds:

(1) Traces (poems and prose), published in December 1924.

(2) Back View (prose), published by Kaiming in October 1928.

(3) Miscellaneous Notes on a European Tour (travelogue), published in September 1934.

(4) You and Me (prose), published by Commercial Press in March 1936.

(5) Miscellaneous Notes on London (travelogue), published in April 1943.

(6) A Primer on Intensive Reading Guidance (essay), published in February 1941.

(7) A Study on the Distinction between Poetry Expressing Intention (essay), published by Kaiming in August 1947.

(8) Random Talks on New Poetry (criticism), published by the Writer's Bookstore in December 1947.

(9) Standard and Scale (criticism), published in April 1948.

(10) Gleanings on Language (book reviews and translations), published in April 1948.

(11) On Popular Appreciation of Elegance and Vulgarity (criticism), published in May 1948.

(12) The Influence of Language and Others (essay), published by Zhengzhong in 1948.

(13) Common Knowledge of Classics (essay), published in August 1942 (co-edited with Ye Shaojun).

(14) A Primer on Skimming Reading Guidance (essay), published by Commercial Press in January 1943 (co-edited with Ye Shaojun).

(15) Chinese Language Teaching (essay), published by Kaiming in April 1945 (co-edited with Ye Shaojun).

As for the essays and sketches scattered in newspapers and magazines across the country, they are too numerous to mention.

Mr. Ziqing first joined the Young China Association and the Literary Research Association, making great contributions to the New Literature. In the past six or seven years, he has devoted himself to the study of linguistics and guided young people on the path of literature because he saw that the Chinese proficiency of students in general middle and high schools has generally declined since the War of Resistance.

During the War of Resistance, in addition to teaching at the Southwest Associated University, he also founded the Chinese Language Weekly with several teachers from the Teachers College of the Associated University in 1941, which was published by Kaiming Bookstore. After the restoration, it was published by Kaiming, and Mr. Ziqing remained the editor-in-chief. This year, in addition to editing high school Chinese textbooks for Kaiming, he also completed the Complete Works of Wen Yiduo. Unfortunately, the book was not yet published when Mr. Ziqing left this world forever.

### Demanding the Return of the Wensuge Library Collection from Japan

— Zhou Tingwu

During the two Sino-Japanese incidents, the "September 18th Incident" and the "August 13th Incident", Japan not only plundered materials, but also looted many of our country's inherent cultural relics. Since the victory, our country's delegation to Japan has drawn up a list, presented it to the Allied Headquarters, and demanded the return of items from Japan. Now it has been reported in newspapers that the whereabouts have been learned, and those that have been recovered include copper coins, the copper bell of Hanshan Temple, and machinery from the Yongli Alkali Plant, etc. However, it has been discovered that during the September 18th Incident in 1931, Japan also looted the original handwritten copy of the Siku Quanshu stored in the Wensuge Pavilion of the Fengtian Imperial Palace, and it has not been mentioned to this day. I hope that our country's delegation to Japan will make a request to the Allied Headquarters to thoroughly investigate the whereabouts, so that Chinese cultural relics can remain flawless and be returned to Zhao in perfect condition.

### Thief's Wisdom

— Yi Yun

The wind of theft has recently become more intense due to the increasing pressure of life. The newspaper recently reported that a batch of thieves was brought by plane from Hankou. Thieves traveling by plane can be said to be extremely wealthy, and their ability to steal pens, swapping them in front of the shop assistants who are packing them together, without them noticing in the slightest, is certainly very clever. Recalling what happened in Shanghai in the past, a certain gentleman had his gold watch stolen, and the circumstances were also very bizarre, as described below.

A certain gentleman lived in the Nanshi district and went to social gatherings in the north of the city every day, returning at night. One evening, the rickshaw puller asked for leave, so he took the tram home. At that time, there were no empty seats in the car, and he stood in the car, surrounded by several people on all sides, who deliberately pushed and shoved. The gentleman was experienced in going out and knew that his gold watch, with its chain slightly exposed, was likely coveted by them. So he focused his eyes on the watch, not looking elsewhere at all, watching how they would strike. After a while, the crowding became even worse, and he couldn't bear the disturbance, so he got off the tram. He saw a person get off with him. Then another tram arrived, and there were fewer passengers in the car, so the gentleman jumped on, and the follower also followed him on. The gentleman laughed inwardly, thinking that if this person was a thief, he was too stupid, knowing that there was a defense and still wasting his efforts. Before long, they reached the place where he had to change to another tram line. The gentleman got off again, and the person still followed him off, closely following him. The gentleman suddenly thought that there were definitely no such stupid thieves in Shanghai, but at that time the wind of assassination was very fierce. Could it be that he was mistaken for an assassination target? Hesitating to this point, he couldn't help but be greatly afraid and didn't dare to change to a rickshaw, because it was already late at night, there were few pedestrians on the road, and rickshaws felt quite isolated. Just as another tram arrived, he immediately rushed on, and the follower still followed him on. The gentleman became even more afraid, as if the god of death was already at his side. Fortunately, the tram had arrived near his home, and he immediately jumped off, and the follower also jumped off after him. The gentleman went straight into the alley, intending to reach his home in a few steps. Unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the alley, the follower also chased into the alley and shouted from behind, saying that he had important matters to discuss and asked him to wait a moment. At this time, the gentleman was terrified, and although he wanted to run away, he didn't dare to move, fearing that if he ran, a bullet would be fired from behind! He had no choice but to wait anxiously. Unexpectedly, things turned out differently. The follower came forward and claimed to be a pickpocket, ordered by his master to steal the gentleman's watch. However, because he was prepared, there was no way to strike. However, the master's rules were extremely strict, and returning empty-handed would result in unbearable beatings. He could only voluntarily prepare the price to buy the watch so that he could return to life. His words were very sad and pathetic, and he presented banknotes, begging for mercy. The gentleman was quite moved, but worried that the banknotes might be counterfeit. Fortunately, the cigarette paper shop at the entrance of the alley was not yet closed, so he specially asked the shop assistant to identify the banknotes. They were all genuine. The gentleman then accepted the banknotes at the original price of the watch and gave him the watch. The pickpocket left with the watch. The gentleman returned to the alley, feeling no fear in his heart and even found the matter very interesting. Moreover, the company where the watch was purchased was currently offering a discount of 20%, so he could buy a new watch of the same style with the banknotes and still have 20% left over. While pondering this, he arrived at his doorstep, knocked on the door, and went in, immediately telling his family about his encounter, full of pride. However, when he recounted the part where he received the banknotes and handed over the watch, he reached into his pocket, wanting to show the original banknotes to his family, but they were nowhere to be found. He searched his body but found nothing. He exclaimed in surprise, and after a moment of reflection, he realized that when he received the banknotes and entered the alley, someone had rushed out of the alley and slightly brushed against him. At that time, he thought that the pickpocket had already obtained the watch and left, and he had no doubts. He didn't expect the thief to be so cunning, actually making his accomplice steal the banknotes when he was unprepared.

### Weights and Measures

— Hong Xian

Each country has its own weights and measures, and each region also has its own weights and measures. Although there is already a so-called International Bureau of Weights and Measures, which uses platinum to make standard scales and places them there as standards, countries and regions inevitably continue to follow their old ways. This is like the concept of national boundaries, provincial boundaries, and county boundaries, and people are unwilling to change their previous habits.

Converting weights and measures is also quite brain-taxing. Often they are not much different in large numbers, but in decimals, even with seven or eight decimal places, it is still impossible to convert them accurately. As for in the market, generous people and thrifty people often have disputes over the difference of an inch or a tael. As a result, those who are willing to give up an inch or a tael give it up in vain, and those who are unwilling to give up an inch or a tael still do not give it up.

In order to gain an advantage, many people like to use their own weights and measures that they consider accurate, to avoid suffering losses due to the inaccuracy of the weights and measures used by others. As a result, both are inaccurate, and disputes are still inevitable.

If everyone treats each other with sincerity and puts courtesy first, why use any weights and measures? Conversely, even if they are used, the problem is not necessarily solved. The difficulty in implementing the theory of "accurate measures and fair scales, so that the people do not quarrel" lies in this.

### Garbage

— Suo Bei

Garbage is a trivial matter and not worth wasting ink and paper on. However, according to our national sentiment, "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep" is already commendable. As for the dirt and garbage on public streets, everyone is already used to it.

Therefore, every day when I pass the entrance of Lane 930, Liyang Road, although I feel very uncomfortable, I cover my nose and pass by, thinking that if the Sanitation Bureau discovers it, it will definitely send someone to clean it up. I also think that in this large lane, there must be "good people" who love cleanliness and will write to the Sanitation Bureau to handle it.

But it is not so. For more than a month, not only has no "idle person" bothered to ask about it, but it has accumulated higher and higher, filling the pit. In addition to the garbage cans being completely submerged, it has also expanded its occupied territory by a zhang in length and width. On top of the garbage, there are fresh watermelon rinds and banana peels every day, benefiting the golden yellow houseflies a lot. I don't know if the gentlemen in the lane feel nauseous when they walk out of the lane and pass by the garbage mountain after eating their fill of watermelon?

Last year, a large photograph was published on the front page of the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, showing the garbage in a certain place, with the title: "The Shanghai Garbage Problem." Afterwards, the authorities paid attention to the removal of garbage, but "familiarity breeds contempt." Now, although it is summer, except for a few noble residential areas, it can be said that garbage is everywhere. The Sanitation Bureau recently announced that it has sprayed so many tons of DDT in the city since the beginning of this summer. Could it be that the garbage everywhere has been sprayed with DDT, so it is not cleaned up and it doesn't matter?

A foreign resident of Shanghai said it well: "If this were in Europe and America, the people would definitely question the government in droves: Where did our taxes go?"

### A Discourse on Sitting Meditation Experiences (5)

— Jiang Wenyu

There is also something to add: Sitting meditation must be a passive rest of consciousness. The two efforts of exercising the motor nerves and actively training the sympathetic nerves must be carried out simultaneously. This has an extremely important relationship in human anatomy and should not be neglected. As I said in the previous article, if the nerves in the head move, the legs suddenly tremble, and saliva is produced in the mouth, etc., these all occur when the brain is quiet and deep, subtle breathing is performed in parallel. I believe that doing only one will definitely not be like this, although I have not experimented with it yet. As for why there are these special anomalies after sitting meditation? (as mentioned in the previous article) How should it be explained? I have to ask physiology experts, but I don't dare to speak casually.

I have three hopes

Finally, I would like to put forward three hopes.

(1) I hope that this effective fitness method can be widely and universally publicized and promoted so that everyone understands it and is willing to learn it; especially for those who have busy jobs and use their brains a lot, I hope that they can set aside one hour or fifty minutes each day to engage in sitting meditation. In this way, not only can health be maintained, but also work efficiency can be greatly increased.

(2) I hope that the majority of people can clearly recognize that this sitting meditation method is a very ordinary fitness technique and does not contain any mysterious meaning at all. It can be learned and studied publicly. The mystical claims of the seeking-immortality-and-becoming-Buddha school can be ignored for the time being.

(3) Since this sitting meditation method can be explained by science, it may as well be further studied by scientific experimental methods. I hope that physiologists, psychologists, and physicians can unite to do a longer-term, planned experiment. Suppose that there are three people from each of the three parties, nine people in total, using the same method and the same time to sit, and each person records their experiences in detail. Each person takes out the data on time, jointly verifies it, and discusses it together. To be more precise, each person checks their pulse, blood pressure, lung capacity, heart function, and blood condition before and after each sitting, or at the beginning and end of each month, and makes a comparison. If this is done for a year or two, I believe that a correct conclusion will definitely be obtained. (Written on August 12, 1948, in Hubu Xuezhai, Shanghai. The full text is completed.)

### Welcoming Old Friend Bin from the South, Preparing Wine to Host and Accompany Him, and Recording Our Late-Night Conversation in a Poem

— Qu Tuìyuan

The Yan dust on my lapel has not yet been collected,
Reuniting, I first lament our separation's sorrow.
Who can abandon the mountains and move the house?
The bamboo you planted yourself, is it still there?
The whole world knows your temples are frosted,
For ten years, I have seen bones forming mounds.
This land, you want to drift away from it again,
Allow me to share a fishing boat with you on the rivers and lakes.

With the meaning not exhausted, I use the same rhyme to write another poem

The forest wind and dew herald the gradual end of summer,
Our hearts are open and cheerful, briefly forgetting our worries.
The host has wine, let's drain a cup,
Meeting tonight, is it like a dream?
Old age loves Zhu Xiushui returning to the south,
Quietly studying the northern method of Li Yingqiu.
Discussing old learning, I can still catch up,
Today, there is an art boat with oars for us both.
