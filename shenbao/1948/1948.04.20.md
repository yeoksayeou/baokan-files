Chiang Kai-shek received the largest majority of votes and was honorably elected as the first truly democratically elected President in Chinese history. His vote count was 2,430, accounting for 90% of the total 2,734 votes cast, excluding 35 invalid votes. The other candidate, Ju Zheng, also received 269 votes. When the election result was announced at the assembly, the entire venue erupted in cheers and applause, with everyone standing and shouting "Long Live the Republic of China" three times. The fervent atmosphere symbolized the people's unanimous support for the current Chairman Chiang, and the beginning of China's democratic politics has thus laid a good foundation. The Presidential Election Assembly began at 9:25 AM. 2,734 representatives attended, with Zhou Zhongyue presiding. Secretary-General Hong Guanyou read the presidium's report, drew lots to determine the vote supervisors and ballot counting supervisors, and explained the voting and ballot counting methods. The entire venue had four ballot writing areas and four voting areas. A zoned, sequential ticket distribution and voting method was adopted, proceeding in an orderly line. Therefore, the process was swift and orderly. At 9:50 AM, the announcement to start collecting ballots was made, and the supervisors took the stage to examine the ballots. Zoned voting began at 10:17 AM. The first person to cast their ballot was Yu Youren, followed by sequential voting. All 2,734 votes were cast within one hour and five minutes, and the entire voting process was completed by 11:22 AM. After voting, the representatives went to the lounge to exchange their attendance certificates. The assembly resumed at 11:30 AM and began counting ballots. The diplomatic corps, including Ambassador Stuart, who had arrived early to observe, were originally seated in the foreign guest area but moved to the front two rows under the podium as the ballot counting was about to begin. At that time, the twelve ballot boxes were gathered together, flanked by publicly displayed vote counts for the two presidential candidates, "Chiang Kai-shek" and "Ju Zheng," decorated extremely beautifully with lighting, creating a dazzling display that was highly praised by the entire venue. At 11:46 AM, the ballot counters, under the supervision of the supervisors, publicly opened the ballot boxes, completing the process by 12:05 PM. Subsequently, they went through the procedures of tallying, verifying, and counting the votes. At 12:40 PM, Hong Lanyou announced the number of votes cast and the number of invalid votes, and the election result was solemnly announced by the assembly chairman at 12:50 PM. At the same time, the lights on the vote counter were lit up, and the vote counts were also announced on the vote counter. The entire venue erupted in cheers. Then, led by the chairman, all the representatives stood up and cheered "Long Live the Republic of China" three times before adjourning the meeting. (See the diagram below for the vote counts announced by the vote counter)

Overseas Chinese communities in Hong Kong held joint celebrations last night.

### U.S. Ambassador's Talk with Our Reporter: The Bright Future of Our Democracy - President Chiang's Election as the First President After the Implementation of the Constitution Further Demonstrates That He Is a Leader Beloved by the Entire Nation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] Ambassador Stuart witnessed the entire process of the presidential election from beginning to end at the National Assembly on the 19th. After learning that Chairman Chiang was elected as the first President of our country after the implementation of the Constitution, he said to our reporter with a smile: The future of China's democratic politics is extremely optimistic. With such a large number of people in the venue, the order was excellent, and the voting was absolutely secret and free, truly a bright symbol of democracy. Chairman Chiang's election as President with an absolute majority of votes further demonstrates that he is a leader jointly loved and respected by the entire nation. The representatives of the Chinese people have exercised their sacred duties in accordance with the Constitution, carefully selecting a head of state who is fully capable of fulfilling the heavy responsibilities. China's history will also begin anew from this point forward.

### Ju Zheng Sends a Special Telegram of Congratulations: Chairman Elected President

[Central News Agency, This City] Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, yesterday sent a telegram congratulating Chairman Chiang on his election as the first President, stating: "To His Excellency Chiang, the President of Nanjing: I have just heard on the radio that you have been elected as the first President with the largest majority. The public sentiment is perfectly in accord, and the expectations of the people are fulfilled. The whole country is united, and the entire nation applauds. I respectfully send this telegram of congratulations and wish you peace and prosperity. Ju Zheng, Mao Hao."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] After Chairman Chiang was elected President, President Yu Youren of the Control Yuan issued the following statement: "Chairman Chiang assisted Dr. Sun Yat-sen in leading the revolution. After eight years of arduous resistance, we finally achieved final victory. His contributions to the nation are immense, and his reputation is known throughout the world. At a time when the domestic and international situation is causing universal unease, the nationwide people's expectation of Chairman Chiang to assume the presidency carries the most significant and far-reaching meaning, for what the people expect is the implementation of the Constitution, the stability of China, and the safeguarding of world peace. No one other than Chairman Chiang can accomplish this task satisfactorily. As the ancients said, 'It is difficult to find the right person for the world.' Today, Chairman Chiang's honorable election as President is truly 'a celebration of finding the right person for the world.' What we expect from Mr. Chiang is that after he takes office as President, a new democratic China will emerge. To promote the establishment of this new democratic China, I, as a representative of the National Assembly, feel extremely fortunate to have cast this sacred vote for Mr. Chiang. I only hope that under the leadership of the new President, we will implement comprehensive reforms, promote and enhance the revolutionary spirit and fighting power of the Kuomintang over the past fifty years, so that every corner of the country (especially the border regions) and every level of society (especially women) can receive a balanced opportunity for political, economic, and cultural development, eliminating the past malpractices of undue emphasis on some aspects while neglecting others. In particular, we must sincerely unite and thoroughly cooperate with friendly parties to strive to build a new China that is of the people, by the people, and for the people."

### National Assembly Proposal: Continued Review Today

Fourteenth Assembly Adjourned

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] The seven review committees of the National Assembly are scheduled to convene separately at 9:00 AM on the 20th to review proposals. Currently, there are nearly 700 proposals awaiting review, so meetings will be held both in the morning and afternoon. The 14th Assembly was originally scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM on the 19th, but due to insufficient attendance at that time, Chairman Feng Youzhen announced an extension of time twice, but the meeting still could not be convened. It was not until around 4:00 PM that the adjournment was announced. The only item on the agenda for the 14th meeting was the government's response to various reviews. In fact, the responses from various departments have already been printed and distributed in written form, so the government's response will no longer take up assembly time.

### National Assembly Announces This Morning: Vice Presidential Candidates - Verification of Signed Nomination Forms Completed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] The National Assembly will announce the list of candidates for the first Vice President of the Republic of China on the morning of the 20th in accordance with the law. The list includes six individuals: Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Li Zongren, Cheng Qian, Mo Dehui, and Xu Chuanlin. The announcement reads: "In accordance with Article 5 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, applying mutatis mutandis the provisions of Paragraph 1, Item 1 of Article 4 of the same law, the list of Vice Presidential candidates is hereby published, and in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the same article, the publication shall be based on the number of representatives who jointly nominated them, in order of precedence. The Presidium of the National Assembly convened a meeting at 8:00 PM on the 19th and appointed more than ten people, including Gu Yuxiu, Liu Shiyi, Du Yuming, and Su Ting, to verify the signed nomination forms. The verification of the signed nomination forms of each candidate was completed at 2:00 AM on the 20th. The most nominations were for Sun Ke as a Vice Presidential candidate, totaling more than 500 votes, followed by Yu Youren, more than 500 votes, Li Zongren, more than 400 votes, Cheng Qian, more than 300 votes, Mo Dehui, more than 200 votes, and Xu Chuanlin, more than 100 votes. Among them, a total of 884 votes were discarded due to duplicate endorsements, with Sun Ke losing 250 votes, Yu Youren 236 votes, Li Zongren 193 votes, Cheng Qian 132 votes, Mo Dehui 55 votes, and Xu Chuanlin 18 votes."

### Measures to Resolve Election Disputes - Awaiting Completion of Legislative Procedures - Representatives Who Signed Nomination Forms Must Write Letters of Resignation After Receiving Certificates

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] The Executive Yuan held a "Discussion Meeting on Resolving Election Disputes" at 5:00 PM on the 19th, presided over by Wu Dingchang, to discuss the six measures proposed by Yu Bin, Wang Yunwu, and others to resolve the disputes over signing as National Assembly representatives. More than 20 people, including Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Lifu, attended and exchanged views for three hours. Several concrete measures have been decided regarding the resolution of the signing representative issue, but they must still be passed by the State Council and complete legislative procedures before they can be implemented. The most important ones are: (1) Representatives who signed nomination forms and received more votes can be issued certificates of election, but upon receiving the certificate of election, they must simultaneously write a letter of resignation, ceding their position to the friendly party's candidate whom they nominated; (2) After the representatives who signed nomination forms receive the election certificate and resign, if they wish to attend the National Assembly as observers, the Civil Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan can consult with the Assembly to allow them to attend; (3) The number of representatives from professional organizations and women's organizations is not explicitly stipulated in the Constitution but is determined by law. To allow representatives who signed nomination forms and those nominated by the Central Government who were not elected to have the opportunity to attend, the number of representatives from women's organizations and professional organizations will be increased by 300. After the State Council passes this measure and completes legislative procedures, elections will be held on another date. Those who are members of the Kuomintang among the representatives who signed nomination forms and were elected are the candidates nominated by the Kuomintang and should be supported by the Kuomintang; (4) The date for the re-elections will be within four to six months after the legislative procedures for increasing the number of representatives are completed; (5) Representatives nominated by the Central Government who received more votes but ceded their position to a friendly party's candidate can also apply the first measure, and the government will issue them a certificate of election; (6) Representatives nominated by the Central Government who were not elected should also be nominated by the Central Government to participate in the re-elections when the legislative procedures for increasing the number of representatives are completed and the supplementary elections are held. It is hoped that the above measures can be submitted for discussion at this week's State Council meeting. Yu Bin has already asked Ma Wenche to convey the contents of his measures to all the representatives who signed nomination forms late at night. The representatives who signed nomination forms believe that the implementation of these measures will still take some time. Although the election certificates can be issued first, they still have to write a letter of resignation, which is not an ideal solution.

### Sun Ke Declares Abandonment of Qualification as Elected Legislator

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] According to reliable sources, President Sun Ke recently sent a letter to the Central Party Headquarters, declaring that he would abandon his qualification as a legislator. It is reported that Mr. Sun was nominated by a political party and elected by the city of Guangzhou.

### Representatives Who Signed Nomination Forms Admitted to Hospital for Observation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] Seven representatives who went on hunger strike, including Yan Zezi, Yang Qiaoxin, and Zhou You, were transferred from the Fifth Guest House to the Central Hospital at 4:30 PM on the 19th.

[Another Dispatch] It is said that the elected representatives who signed nomination forms are deeply grateful for the efforts of representatives such as Yu Bin and Mo Dehui, as well as the diligent and patient guidance of female doctor Hua Shujun, who went to inject glucose solutions every day. They are willing to be admitted to the hospital for recuperation. It is said that Representative Zhou You was moved to tears by Dr. Hua's kind persuasion. Representative Hua was elected by the free occupational groups, hence the recent nickname of "Goddess of Freedom" at the National Assembly.

### Newly Appointed Envoys from Four Countries Present Credentials in Order

### A Brief Biography of Chiang Kai-shek, First President of Our Nation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] A brief biography of President Chiang Kai-shek, the first president of the Republic of China:

President Chiang Kai-shek, named Zhongzheng, styled Jieshi, was born in Xikou Township, Fenghua County, Zhejiang Province, on October 31st, twenty-five years before the founding of the Republic of China. He is now sixty-two years old. His ancestors were farmers and scholars who did not seek official positions. His grandfather, Wang Biao, and his uncle, Ni Su'an, were both known for their virtuous conduct. His mother, Madam Wang, was virtuous, intelligent, and far-sighted. When the President was eight or nine years old, he suffered the loss of both his grandfather and father in quick succession, and his family fortune declined. Madam Wang personally taught him and supervised his studies strictly, but also cared for him with utmost concern, hoping for his great future. At the age of seventeen, the President entered the Fenghua Fenglu Academy. The following year, he studied with Mr. Gu Qinglian in Yin County, who praised and encouraged him greatly for his exceptional talent. He studied the works of the philosophers of the Zhou and Qin dynasties, as well as the collected works of Zeng Guofan, and also practiced Sun Tzu's strategies, striving to become a match for ten thousand enemies. Later, the President often said that his knowledge of Chinese academic sources and his understanding of reading methods all came from Mr. Gu's teachings.

The President's lifelong learning and achievements, as well as his virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, were all rooted in his excellent family and early childhood education. At the age of nineteen, he studied at the Longjin Middle School in the county. At that time, during the Sino-Japanese War, the President was deeply saddened by the country's daily decline and the internal and external pressures. His ambition to save the country and its people deepened with age, and he vowed to study military science abroad. He then went to Japan, but because he was not recommended by the domestic Ministry of the Army, he entered the Qinghua School. In Tokyo that year, he met Mr. Chen Qimei and made many revolutionary friends, marking the beginning of his dedication to the revolutionary cause. He returned to China in the winter, and the following year, he passed the entrance examination for the Baoding Military Academy and was selected to study in Japan as a military student. He then went to Japan again. It was five years before the founding of the Republic of China, and the President was one year old [in the Chinese way of counting age]. He entered the Tokyo Shinbu Gakko (Military Preparatory School), where he joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) through the introduction of Mr. Chen Qimei, further connecting with comrades to serve the revolution. Two years later, he graduated and entered the 13th Field Artillery Regiment of the Japanese Takada, serving as a non-commissioned officer. Life in the camp was extremely strict, with morning exercises, grooming horses, and evening polishing of boots, enduring hardship and labor, and strengthening his physical body. He believed that he owed much of his lifelong learning and career to this experience. Two years later, as the opportunity for the Xinhai Revolution became increasingly ripe, the President returned to China from Japan that summer and secretly planned with Mr. Chen Qimei in Shanghai to launch uprisings in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In August, he returned to the regiment, but within a month, he received news of the Wuchang Uprising. He disguised himself, went to Nagasaki, boarded a ship back to China, and took charge of the Zhejiang affairs. He went to Hangzhou to mobilize the new army and recruit dare-to-die squads for the uprising. On September 13th, Shanghai declared independence. The following night at two o'clock, Hangzhou responded. The dare-to-die squads were the first to attack, destroying the Governor's office and capturing Qing officials. After Zhejiang Province was taken, he returned to Shanghai to assist Mr. Qimei in planning the entire Jiangsu Province, personally training an infantry regiment and serving as its commander, which was the 5th Regiment of the Shanghai Army. In the early years of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai seized power, destroyed the constitution, and suppressed the revolution. The President followed Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai, assisting Mr. Qimei in the revolution and participating in the Fourth Anti-Yuan Campaign. The uprising of the Zhaohe gunboat was particularly effective in demonstrating the power of the revolution and frightening the warlords. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen went south to protect the constitution. The President stayed in Shanghai, assessed the state of affairs, and advocated for the Northern Expedition. He repeatedly wrote to Sun Yat-sen, presenting his strategies for governing the country. Over the next four years, his plans were insightful and accurate, and his assistance in military affairs was often ingenious. In May of the tenth year, Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of President. The President formulated strategies for stabilizing Anhui and Guangxi. In June, his mother, Madam Wang, passed away. The President was deeply saddened and observed mourning at home, often saying that the way to repay his virtuous mother was to dedicate himself to the revolution and the party-state. In the spring of the eleventh year, he was summoned to Guilin. In May, he accompanied Sun Yat-sen in Shaoguan to swear an oath for the Northern Expedition, but suddenly faced the Chen Jiongming Incident. The President rushed from Shanghai to Guilin to assist, serving Sun Yat-sen on the Yongfeng warship, taking on difficult and dangerous tasks, and gaining further recognition and trust from Sun Yat-sen. In the twelfth year, he was sent to Russia by Sun Yat-sen to report and conduct investigations, paying attention to the country's revolutionary and nation-building path. In June of the thirteenth year, the Military Academy was established in Whampoa. The President was appointed as the principal, personally handling all matters, both large and small, to cultivate revolutionary military cadres and lay the foundation for the Northern Expedition. In March of the fourteenth year, Sun Yat-sen passed away. The President mourned the passing of the revolution's leader and felt the heavy burden of continuing the revolutionary cause. In July of the fifteenth year, he assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, leading his troops on the Northern Expedition, directly advancing through the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian. Wherever the army went, the people felt as if they were being rescued from a dire situation. Within half a year, the southeast was stabilized. In April of the sixteenth year, the National Government was established in Nanjing. The President, feeling that his long-cherished wish had been partially fulfilled, retired after achieving success. In the same year, he went to Japan and then returned to China. Afterwards, he married Miss Soong Mei-ling in Shanghai. At that time, the remnants of the Northern warlords were occupying territories, and Japan was obstructing the Northern Expedition. The President was ordered by the Central Government to lead the troops again and continue the Northern Expedition, attacking Beijing and Tianjin. The Northeast changed its flag, and the great task of unification was completed. In the seventeenth and twentieth years, he twice served as Chairman of the National Government. At that time, the conflicts in the south and the central plains caused the revolution to repeatedly face crises. The President calmly faced the situation, and ultimately turned the country's fortunes from danger to safety. After the September 18th Incident, the President knew that national defense was not strong and exercised patience and prudence, resigning from his position to gain understanding. During the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the President responded to the nationwide expectation and assumed the position of Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, enduring humiliation and bearing a heavy burden, and dealing with the enemy. After that, he worked hard to govern the country, build national defense, and actively prepare for resisting foreign aggression and strengthening the country. In the twenty-third year, he promoted the New Life Movement to change social customs. The following year, he promoted national economic construction to benefit the people's livelihood. In October of the twenty-fifth year, on the President's fiftieth birthday, people at home and abroad offered airplanes as birthday gifts. The President published an article, "Serving the Country and Remembering One's Parents," using a review of his personal experiences to encourage compatriots to jointly dedicate themselves to serving the country, which was deeply moving. However, not long after, the Xi'an Incident occurred, and the President was held captive for two weeks. With his upright character and influence, he finally made the rebellious generals submit, and he returned to Nanjing safely.

In the twenty-sixth year, when the July 7th Incident occurred, the President, realizing that the final moment had arrived, led the nation to rise up and resist the war. The following year, in March, the Provisional National Congress of the Kuomintang was held in Hankou, and he was elected as Director-General. In the same year, he founded the Three Principles of the People Youth League and personally served as its leader. In the twenty-eighth year, he was elected as Chairman of the National Defense Supreme Committee and concurrently served as President of the Executive Yuan. After that, he commanded and planned, working diligently day and night, and was finally able to suppress the enemy's fierce flames and bring the country's fortunes to revival.

After the Pacific War, the President's outstanding insight and great achievements were increasingly admired by friendly nations, both in government and among the people. In February of the thirty-first year, he visited India. During the National Day of that year, the United Kingdom and the United States announced the abolition of unequal treaties. The following year, in January, new treaties between China and the United Kingdom and the United States were established, and the century-old shackles were finally lifted. The President further telegraphed to encourage compatriots, showing them that this was not easy to achieve and urging them to work hard in the future. In September of that year, the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee elected him as Chairman of the National Government. On October 10th, he solemnly took office amidst the unanimous support of the military and civilians of the country. On November 12th, he met with President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in Cairo to discuss military and political strategies in the Pacific theater and decided on the plan for the reconstruction of East Asia. The following year, the Four-Nation Declaration was signed, which further enhanced the righteousness of China's war of resistance and strengthened the cooperation of the Allied nations. After Germany and Italy were defeated, the Japanese army lost courage. In August of the thirty-fourth year, Japan was defeated and exhausted, declaring unconditional surrender. The great and arduous war of resistance that had lasted for eight years was finally concluded victoriously.

In May of the thirty-fifth year, the National Government triumphantly returned to the capital. The President led civil and military officials to pay tribute to the spirit of Sun Yat-sen and was warmly supported by compatriots throughout the country. On November 15th, the National Government convened the National Assembly. The Kuomintang, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and social elites without party affiliation jointly formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China, which was promulgated on January 1st of the thirty-sixth year and implemented on December 25th of the same year, realizing the long-cherished wish of returning power to the people and establishing a solid foundation for the Republic of China for centuries to come.

The President's greatness lies in his ordinariness. His daily life is no different from ordinary people, but it is even simpler and more frugal than most. The President advocates the New Life Movement and is also a practitioner of it. He has a very strict and disciplined life, valuing time more than money and valuing spirit more than matter. He does not smoke or drink. His meals are extremely simple. Even when hosting guests, he does not prepare delicacies, only four dishes and one soup. His clothing is also only clean and tidy, not luxurious. In the past ten years, he has worn military uniforms for two-thirds of the time, with only three or four sets to change regularly. He wears casual clothes at home, and the materials he chooses are all domestic products. His residence is like that of ordinary civilians. When traveling or staying elsewhere, he travels light with a small entourage. Even if the environment is messy, he can still handle it with composure. He gets up early every morning, sits quietly for a while, and then begins his busy day of work, which always lasts more than fourteen hours. The President is dedicated to his work, possesses leadership talent, and has a spirit of adventure and struggle, pursuing truth, working hard and tirelessly, and constantly striving for self-improvement, which is why he has been able to achieve his great career.

The President's great achievements in his life, in addition to benefiting from the education of his virtuous mother and good teachers in his youth, are also greatly influenced by Madame Chiang. In the twenty-third year, Madame Chiang assisted the President in launching the New Life Movement to improve the people's knowledge, morality, and living habits, which was an important social movement led by the President for revolution and nation-building. In the twenty-fifth year, when the President was held captive in Xi'an, Madame Chiang resolutely went to the rescue, sharing his safety and danger. During the war, she not only devoted herself to the sacred work of rescue, healing, and childcare, but also accompanied the President on visits to India, participated in the Cairo Conference, and visited the United States, working hard on foreign publicity, which was admired by the world.

The President has followed Sun Yat-sen in devoting himself to the revolution, always with the goal of building China into an independent, free, unified, and democratic country as his lifelong ambition. For decades, the President and China have been an inseparable part of history. During that time, the country faced difficulties, and the President bore them all on his shoulders, awakening the national spirit, gathering national strength, and striving for the country's destiny. The hardships were unprecedented, and the achievements were unmatched by any era in national history. When the country's fortunes were at their most pessimistic, the President alone remained steadfast. When the public was most confused, the President alone had his own views. When everyone was surrendering to the environment, the President alone upheld his fearless spirit, knowing that it was impossible but doing it anyway. All these examples can be seen in the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. If it were not for the President's strong and great character to guide us, it is highly doubtful whether our Chinese nation could have survived thousands of hardships and dangers without falling in recent decades. Looking back, the President has used his outstanding military genius to complete the great achievements of the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. He has also used his outstanding diplomatic and political talents to befriend strong neighbors, resolve internal political grievances, and lead the country towards the path of unity and democracy. Therefore, China cannot be without a President, and looking to the future, China cannot be without a President for even a day. At this time, when suppressing rebellion, saving the country, and implementing the constitution have just begun, we must rely on the wise, unwavering, and universally admired President to continue his leadership in order to lay the foundation for the country's permanent peace and unity. The prosperity and decline of our country and the survival of our nation all depend on the President alone.

### Editorial: The Bright Future of Democratic Constitutionalism

——Congratulating Chairman Chiang on Being Elected First President

The National Assembly elected the first President of the Republic of China yesterday morning at 10 a.m. and solemnly counted the ballots on the spot. As we expected, our nation’s supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek received 2,430 votes and was elected, accounting for nearly 90% of the total number of delegates present. This is not only an epoch-making initiative in our country’s politics, but also the most glorious page in our history. Therefore, as soon as the news of Chairman Chiang’s election as President spread, people from all walks of life in the capital, upon hearing the good news, competed to set off firecrackers to celebrate. The enthusiastic situation was no less than when the good news of the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan was received three years ago. In Shanghai, all newspapers published extra editions. The red news reports were sold out, and citizens were extremely excited. All factories, businesses, schools, and public organizations will automatically hang flags today to celebrate. At this time of bright spring sunshine, the sight of the colorful national flags waving in the streets is enough to symbolize the bright and brilliant future of our country’s democratic constitutionalism.

The nationwide celebration of Chiang Kai-shek’s election as President is enough to show the sincere support of the people for Chiang Kai-shek. However, we must not always immerse ourselves in self-intoxication, only knowing how to praise and feel self-satisfied. We should maintain a considerable degree of calmness in our enthusiasm. On the one hand, we should think more about the future of the country. On the other hand, we should deeply reflect on how to fulfill the responsibilities of the people of a democratic country for politics. Therefore, we would like to take the opportunity of the nationwide celebration of Chiang Kai-shek’s election as President to express our hopes for the future new government.

First, the election of Chiang Kai-shek as the first President by this National Assembly has not only completed its historical mission, but has also brought Chinese politics into another new stage. Since Chiang Kai-shek led his troops on the Northern Expedition, he first overthrew the warlords who dared to engage in civil wars, completing the unification of the Republic of China. After that, he resisted foreign aggression, and after eight years of arduous struggle, he defeated our strong enemy, the Japanese invaders, and abandoned all unequal treaties. The goal of nationalism can be said to have been fully realized. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, he actively promoted democratic constitutionalism, regardless of the obstruction and sabotage of the Communist bandits, fully demonstrating the spirit of doing his best. Two years ago, he convened the National Assembly to formulate a democratic constitution. This year, he convened the National Assembly to elect a President, following the constitutional procedures and gradually embarking on the path of true democratic constitutionalism. As far as the principle of people’s rights is concerned, it can be said that more than half has been implemented. However, looking at the Three Principles of the People advocated by Sun Yat-sen, only the principle of people’s livelihood has not been implemented. Looking at the domestic situation, because of the enemy’s invasion and destruction, the vitality has not yet recovered. The Communist bandits followed closely, attempting to expand their territory by force, disregarding the lives and deaths of the people, destroying domestic transportation everywhere, and destroying the people’s production, so that the people could not live, the society was turbulent, and even the country’s lifeline was in a state of dying. Therefore, we believe that the most urgent problem in our country at present is to stabilize the people’s livelihood. As long as we implement Sun Yat-sen’s principle of people’s livelihood, we can not only save the people from deep water and fire, but also be the only best way to win back the hearts of the people. How should our country’s industry be industrialized? How should our country’s land be reformed? These are all the urgent tasks of the constitutional government and the focus of our people’s hopes for governance.

Second, Chiang Kai-shek is the first person in the country who is loyal to the constitution and loyal to its implementation. Now that he has been elected as the first President, he will naturally abide by the constitution and will execute the President’s basic tasks in accordance with the constitutional procedures. At present, the people of the whole country are watching to see whom he will recommend to the Legislative Yuan to be the President of the Executive Yuan. We also feel that the choice of the first President of the Executive Yuan of the constitutional government is also very important, and it is a key to cultivating a new democratic political style. The incompetence and corruption of the past government have been known to China and foreign countries, and there is no need to conceal them. Therefore, we hope that the future new government can eliminate corruption by establishing a civil service system and improving the treatment of civil servants, and improve administrative efficiency by selecting and employing the competent. From then on, the government can not only have a new look, but also truly start anew with the people.

In short, Chairman Chiang’s election as President is the first step for our country’s politics to embark on democratic constitutionalism, but it brings us unlimited new hope. The above two items are just the starting point of political reform. We hope that the new constitutional government will soon use facts to satisfy our wishes and open up a bright future for our country’s democratic constitutionalism!

### The Financial Crisis in This City

Due to the separate reorganization of various taxes in our city, the income has gradually improved, and the income and expenditures can be offset. During the peak collection period, the city treasury also had a considerable surplus. Monthly expenditures can be allocated according to the budget, and there has never been any news of overdue salaries or payments. In a time of financial difficulties and widespread poverty, this must be considered a barely satisfactory matter.

However, the situation afterwards does not seem as smooth as in the past. According to the Finance Bureau, the total amount of salaries for government employees in March was 130 billion yuan. After the adjustment of treatment, it will increase to more than 300 billion yuan, and the total income of the city’s finances is only 322.5 billion yuan. Then the amount of daily income is at most enough to pay salaries, and other business expenses are completely unavailable. Moreover, the salaries of public educators will be adjusted monthly in the future. According to the current trend, there is no sign that the price increase will stop, then the difference between income and expenditure will inevitably become more and more distant. If this continues, indeed, as Director Tian said: the future of local finances is not optimistic.

That being said, public finance is different from private finance after all. No matter how difficult it is, we must try our best to find ways to deal with it. Therefore, how to overcome this difficulty and how to deal with this situation is not only a major issue for the city’s financial authorities, but also a matter that every citizen should be concerned about.

According to normal theory, all solutions to the problem of financial imbalance must follow two old paths, namely, increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Among the ways to increase revenue, in addition to the path of price increase that is not feasible now, there are only two ways to increase new taxes and reorganize old taxes. Whether these two paths are feasible and whether the general public still has the ability to bear the burden is not considered for the time being. In fact, it will inevitably take a long time and many efforts to gradually achieve it. Therefore, relying solely on these two paths to cope with the ever-increasing deficit is at least a question in terms of technology.

The expenditure on employee salaries used to account for nearly 40% of the total expenditure, and now it will account for the entirety of the total expenditure, or even exceed this total. Then, the old tune of reducing personnel seems to have to be replayed. However, as far as we can see, all departments are calling for insufficient manpower due to being too busy, so the new establishment of the city government approved by the Executive Yuan cannot be considered difficult to implement, and we must ask for changes again. Moreover, due to the holding of new businesses or coping with the new environment, there are still many institutions that are constantly being added outside of this new establishment. Therefore, to take the path of reducing expenditure, it is useless to talk about reducing staff alone. We must consider slowing down the new businesses or temporarily suspending the unimportant businesses, which is the fundamental solution.

However, the importance of businesses often varies in its assessment due to different subjectivity. There are many businesses that are considered secondary or even wasteful by the general public, but to the主管 or stakeholders, all are justified. Therefore, this path cannot be taken either. Therefore, the future of the city’s finances is not optimistic.

### Fu Zuoyi and Chu Xichun Fly to Taiyuan Together, Visit Yan Xishan for a Long Talk, and Thoroughly Review Military Affairs. Will They Return to Beiping by the Original Plane? National Army in Southern Hebei Recaptures Dongming, and Continues to Pursue and Suppress Communist Bandits in Eastern Hebei.

[Beiping News, 19th] Fu Zuoyi and Chu Xichun flew to Taiyuan together at 8 a.m. this morning for a “Visit in the Style of Return to Ning," and will return to Beiping that night. Observers say: The meeting between Fu, Yan, and Chu to broadly review the overall situation in North China in terms of military and political strategies for bandit suppression is inevitable. However, it is too early to say that the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters will take joint action.

[Beiping News, 19th] Dongming in Southern Hebei was recovered by local militia on the 12th. There was a fierce battle in Wuqing, near the Pingjin Line. More than 2,000 Communist bandits occupied Hexiwu on the Pingjin Highway yesterday. They are now in fierce battle with the Wuqing garrison near the city.

[Baoding News, 19th] The National Army that recovered Anxin in Central Hebei continued to circle south on the 19th to pursue and suppress the remnant bandits in the surrounding areas of Gaoyang, Lixian, and Qingyuan. All the independent battalions of bandits on both sides of the Qingshui River were defeated, and 20 shi of bandit military rations and dozens of war horses were captured. They are still being encircled and suppressed in separate routes.

[Guihua News, 18th] Communist bandits who attacked Dongsheng were defeated by the local militia and fled back to Ernuanshui in Jungar Banner. In addition, the main forces of the 1st and 6th Columns of Nie Rongzhen's troops, in cooperation with the 3rd Independent Brigade of the Jin-Sui Military Region, attacked Ying County from Weiyuanbao (the border area between Shanxi and Suiyuan, belonging to Shanxi). There has been fierce fighting in the city for several days. The garrison is the former unit of Qiao Richun, a People's Hero of Northern Shanxi. Qiao died while defending Ying County in 1946.

Then Yan hosted a lunch banquet, which was attended by senior Shanxi generals Yang Aiyuan, Wang Jingguo, Sun Chu, and others. After the meal, the three continued their talks for three hours, elaborating in detail on the political, economic, and anti-traitor measures in Shanxi. Fu also explained the strategic and tactical methods of bandit suppression. At 5 p.m., Fu and Chu left Taiyuan. Before leaving, Yan gave them local products such as carpets and serge. According to Fu, the Civil Salvation Vanguard, equipped with cavalry, specializes in attacking the rear of the bandits. The National Army that captured Yixian made progress again yesterday. There is no decisive battle on the Ping-Sui Line yet. Local administrative work should be based on the principle of using local cadres, which is more effective. Chu said that the Civil Salvation Vanguard has been established for more than two months, with 1,300 cadres, and 13 teams have been formed. Hebei Province does not separate military and political affairs, but seeks to facilitate bandit suppression, so it is confident in bandit suppression.

[Zhangjiakou News, 19th] Zhangjiakou has returned to normal, and traffic on the Pingzhang Line is unimpeded. The Zhangtong section has also begun to continue repairs, and the North Chahar Highway has also been opened to Pingzhangbei and Kangbao counties.

### Detention Center Warden Rapes Female Prisoner, Forces Abortion Almost Leading to Death; Chen Guangcheng Flees in Fear of Punishment After Being Accused

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guangzhou, 19th] Zhanjiang News: A shocking case occurred at the Guangzhou Bay District Court, where a detention center warden was accused of raping a female prisoner, causing her to become pregnant, and then forcing her to have an abortion, almost leading to her death.

### National Assembly Chronicle: The Choice of the Chinese People

[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] At noon on April 19, 1948, in Nanjing, the national flags fluttered in the clear sky, reflecting the spring sunlight. Newspaper boys shouted the headlines, racing on the streets, and the breeze carried excited voices, as firecrackers accompanied the broadcast:

"At the presidential election meeting of the First National Assembly this morning, Chiang Kai-shek received 2,430 votes and was elected the first President of the Republic of China." All the people of Nanjing were spreading this heartwarming news, because everyone felt that this was their own choice, just as British Ambassador Sir Stevenson said after learning the election results in the meeting place: "This is the choice of the Chinese people, good!"

The meeting on the 19th was unprecedentedly grand. Almost all the reported delegates attended, and some delegates arrived particularly early. At the beginning of the meeting, a female "delegate" who had been judged by the court to be ineligible to be elected and lost her delegate status made a small fuss. After that, the entire meeting time was filled with joy, replacing the usual shouts, hisses, and laughter. The long table and chairs at the back of the chairman's platform were replaced with a wooden screen, with a total of thirty-six voting booths. The delegate seats on the last row on both sides of the upper floor were also removed, and eighteen voting booths were separated with pink silk screens. Twelve ballot boxes were prepared according to the twelve districts of the seating arrangement upstairs and downstairs. Hong Lanyou spent more than half an hour helping Chairman Zhou Zhongyue report on various precautions for the election, and assigned the inspectors to their posts. Voting began at 11:15. The entire process of issuing ballots, writing ballots, and voting was divided into two halves, starting with the delegates sitting in the front row, who lined up and proceeded in an orderly manner. They received ballots with their delegate certificates, entered the voting booth which was just big enough to hold one person, secretly marked the circles, folded the ballots, and sent them into the ballot box, completing this sacred mission. Hong Lanyou stood in front of the podium, observing in all directions and listening to all sounds, shouting "Please do not sit in the seats of the delegates if you are not a delegate" to the east, and "Please do not block our aisles, photography reporters" to the west. He apologized repeatedly to the delegates sitting in the back row waiting their turns. From 10:37 to 10:38, applause broke out twice in a row in the delegate seats, and the drowsy delegates woke up one by one, their tired eyes dazed by the mercury lights. After a while, they realized that it was the border rose Zuo Erhan and the National Assembly flower Tang Shunjun who had voted one after the other on the left and right sides. The delegates who had voted went to the lounge to rest one after another, and the number of people in the hall and the beads of sweat on Hong Lanyou's forehead gradually decreased.

The reporters who were looking around and bouncing around would not be asked to leave the venue this time. Hong Lanyou said: "Gentlemen reporters, I have fulfilled my promise."

After being busy for more than an hour, the inspectors wearing red-edged purple silk ribbons, and several delegates who were not flexible, also voted under the care of Zhao Junhao, the ballot issuing inspector. Zhou Zhongyue announced the preparation for counting the votes.

The public announcement board for Chiang Kai-shek's votes was placed on the right side of the chairman's platform, and the public announcement board for Ju Zheng's votes was placed on the left. The delegates returned to the venue, and twenty or so observing envoys also came down from the platform and sat in the front row of the chairman's seat. They all smiled and refused to guess the election results. Ambassador Stuart said: "The election is conducted under open attention and good order, it must be very fair." But when asked to guess who would be elected, he smiled and said: "You can guess like me!" Miss Kadimi, the daughter of the Iranian charge d'affaires, was the only female foreign guest. Her beautiful eyes looked at the public announcement board for Ju Zheng's votes, shining with the light of fluorescent lamps. She asked: "Who is Chairman Chiang's competitor?" At this time, Foreign Minister Wang, who participated in the ceremony of the four envoys from Uzbekistan presenting their credentials, also hurried in in formal attire. He said that because Chairman Chiang did not come, he gave up his right to vote.

Applause for Three Consecutive Minutes

The vote counting only took one lens. In the tense atmosphere, Hong Lanyou reported the total number of votes as 2,743 instead of 2,734. Zhou Zhongyue also moved the election forward by ten years, saying: "The Republic of China in its twenty-seventh year, ah no! April 19, thirty-seventh year?..." The result that Chiang Kai-shek received 2,430 votes caused the entire audience to applaud continuously for three minutes. Ju Zheng's 269 votes also received enthusiastic applause for a full minute. At 12:50, after Zhou Zhongyue's trembling and joyful announcement: "Chiang Kai-shek is elected as the first President of the Republic of China," cheers almost broke through the roof of the assembly hall, and the entire audience stood up and shouted "Long live the Republic of China" three times. The excitement of the remaining numbers and the good news, as the meeting dispersed, spread out of the gate of the hall, spread all over Nanjing, and spread all over China. Ambassador Stuart sincerely said: "The history of the Republic of China has begun again from today." This sentence will tell the world to those who care about China. (April 19, Nanjing)

### Preliminary Results of the Italian Election: Government Party Shows Clear Victory; Voter Turnout Nearly 90% of Total

[Report from Our Own Correspondent] London, 19th - Radio broadcast: Rome report - Semi-official sources state that concerning the results of the Senate elections, reports have been received from 254 constituencies out of Italy's 41,648 constituencies. Among these, the Christian Democratic Party has obtained 70,021 votes, while the Communist Front has secured 48,135 votes. The election results have already been calculated, and the districts include 19 districts in the Rome area, 122 districts in the Milan area, 28 districts in the Bologna area, 1 district in the Venice area, 64 districts in the Turin area, and 20 districts in the Florence area.

[Reuters, Rome, 19th] Italy's historic election, lasting a day and a half, concluded at 2 PM on the 19th. Rome Radio reported at 3 PM, "The last vote has been cast into the ballot box. Italy and the world will know the direction of the Italian nation tonight." The crowds in front of polling stations this morning were far less enthusiastic than on Sunday, as 90% of voters had already cast their ballots on Sunday. Officials predict that the number of voters will account for a very large proportion of the total electorate, due to the awakening of the passively-minded middle class. Leaders of the center and right-wing parties therefore anticipate that the final results will show a trend of the public moving away from the People's Front. The general public also expects the Christian Democratic Party to win a significant victory. A very notable phenomenon in this general election is the near absence of violent acts, partly due to the strict security measures of the military police. However, many people are still hesitant to predict what actions the Communist Party will take after failing in the election. Therefore, the whole country is hoping that the national armed forces can prevent any riots from occurring.

[Reuters, Rome, 19th] The Ministry of the Interior announced that in each of the 68 provinces of Italy, by 10 PM on the 18th, the number of voters who had voted had reached 69% to 88% of the total number of voters. At the same time, although the final results are still pending formal announcement after voting closed at 2 PM today, it is already rumored in Rome that the Communist Party has suffered a crushing defeat everywhere. In Rome, Genoa, Milan, Brescia, and other places, the Communist Party has suffered setbacks. Only in Turin, a Communist stronghold, does the People's Front hold an advantage. Rome Radio announced at about 1 PM that Prime Minister Gasperi and Communist leader Togliatti would both issue formal declarations on the evening of the 19th. Large crowds have gathered outside newspaper offices to await the unveiling of the final results.

[Associated Press, Rome, 19th] In the 183 senatorial constituencies of Rome, the initial results of the two counts show that the candidates of the Christian Democratic Party led by Prime Minister Gasperi account for 71%, while the People's Front led by the Communist Party has 15%.

[Reuters, Rome, 19th] Officials from the General Election Office began opening ballot boxes in the Rome area at about 2 PM on the 19th, under the supervision of representatives from various parties. The ballot boxes were guarded overnight by military police on the 18th. Officials from the Election Office said that the ballot counting process in the Rome area would continue until 2 AM on the morning of the 20th at the earliest. Semi-official estimates indicate that by noon on the 19th, 25 million people nationwide had voted, representing 87% of the total electorate. Voter turnout in northern provinces was very high, while it was lower in the south. In some cities, only 75% of voters cast their ballots. In the city of Valcona in northern Italy, only three out of 803 voters abstained, setting the highest record for voter turnout. In the province of Piedmont, voter turnout accounted for 95% of the total electorate.

### French Prime Minister Schuman Expresses Willingness to Cooperate Sincerely with Italy, Plans to Promote Legislation to Implement Military Reform

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] French Prime Minister Schuman delivered a speech in the city of Poitiers today, stating that France's economic situation has improved, but progress is still insufficient. He said that France's imports still exceed exports, and this situation will need to continue for several years before there is hope of having sufficient foreign currency, especially US dollars, to pay for imports. When discussing the international situation, Schuman said that the need for international solidarity is increasing daily, and the solidarity during wartime still retains its value after the war. France will not exclude the friendship of anyone, even those who were enemies of France yesterday, such as Italy, which was separated from free and peaceful countries due to the oppression of its regime. He hopes that the results of this Italian general election will allow democracy to be restored on the Italian peninsula and establish sincere cooperation between France and Italy.

Regarding the German question, he believes that a solution must be formulated based on democratic principles and taking into account security needs. He said that any plan to establish a centralized German government will arouse German ideas of revenge and aggressive imperialism. Schuman also revealed that when the parliament reconvenes, the government will request the passage of laws to implement military reform.

### Marseilles Communists Hold Demonstration, Clash with De Gaulle Supporters

[Agence France-Presse, Marseilles, 18th] 100,000 people gathered at the Old Port to hear a speech by De Gaulle, leader of the "French People's Rally." At the other end of the pier, several thousand people participated in a Communist rally to protest De Gaulle's arrival in Marseilles. Former Minister of Health Billoux and several Communist members of the General Confederation of Labor vehemently criticized De Gaulle's policies, saying that their aim was to establish a personal dictatorship. After the rally, the Communists held a demonstration on the main thoroughfares of Marseilles. The two groups clashed in front of De Gaulle's headquarters, but there were no casualties.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] Communist leader Thorez spoke this afternoon at the Buffalo Stadium in the southern suburbs of Paris, calling on French socialists and Catholic citizens to join the Communist Party and fight together for freedom. Thorez then attacked the Marshall Plan, saying that De Gaulle had praised it as a "way out" of the impasse. "We ask, what is this way out?" The answer is to provoke war against the Soviet Union and the new people's democracies.

### Pope Expresses Concern About the Italian Election Situation

[Reuters, Vatican City, 19th] The Pope in the Vatican Palace receives hourly reports on the progress of the Italian general election. The Pope waits for the arrival of reports in his private study. The study has direct contact with another office where reports from all over the country are first sorted and analyzed before being passed to the study. The Pope told friends that he was pleased with the orderly nature of the voting.

### Italian Communist Leader Says Opposition Between Left and Right Groups Will Lead to Disastrous Consequences

[Reuters, Rome, 18th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti predicted that if the Communist Party is not allowed to participate in the government, Italy will experience unrest. In an article in the Communist Party's official newspaper, Unità, he wrote, "At the end of the election campaign, I called for the unity of democratic forces because I know that without this unity, our country will face unpleasant days. We are currently threatened with the re-establishment of a reactionary regime, and even the danger of a resurgence of fascism. We are also in danger of being dragged into a military bloc that questions military matters, thus causing war or becoming an imperialist war base. In addition, there is the threat that social conflicts will intensify due to the failure to realize social reforms in the constitution. In short, the permanent division of the main political forces into opposing groups will make the threat more serious and lead to tragic results.

### Will the Anti-Communist Motion Be Passed? The Pan-American Conference Will Be Tested. Unrest in Bogotá Continues, Instability in Central and South America

[Associated Press, Bogotá, 19th] News on the 19th: The United States, Brazil, and Chile have agreed on the terms of the proposal to be submitted to the Pan-American Conference. The motion strongly condemns the Soviet Union and calls on Western Hemisphere countries to "sanction communism." The motion, which is more strongly worded than expected before the rebellion in Colombia, will be submitted to the General Assembly on the 19th or 20th.

Shooting incidents occurred here again on the 18th, and the presidential palace was also affected.

Uruguay and Cuba have yet to decide whether they are willing to chair the case. The Pan-American Conference has begun to accelerate its plan to pass the agenda. The steering committee, composed of chief representatives, will begin to continue the meeting in order to complete the agenda on the 19th. The agenda already includes the new mutual defense pact of the Pan-American Organization, the anti-communist motion, and another motion related to foreign colonies in the Western Hemisphere. The main test of the conference, especially for the United States, is the anti-communist motion.

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] It was revealed on the 18th that the State Department had received unconfirmed reports that communist or communist-backed groups may attempt to seize power in Chile and Ecuador within weeks. The State Department pointed out that these reports lack official confirmation. One of the reports appears to be consistent with an official announcement by the Chilean government, which stated that the country's Communist Party plans to launch an uprising on May 1, aimed at kidnapping President Videla and other military and political leaders. Regarding the report on Ecuador, it stated that "conservatives," with the help of the Communist Party, will seize power around June 1. Costa Rican Security Minister General Lani Picado said in Mexico City that the Communist Party plans to launch uprisings in Chile, Venezuela, and British Jamaica in the near future. Senior officials of the Brazilian government also attributed the bombing that destroyed most of the military base in Brasilia on the 16th to a conspiracy by international communists.

[Associated Press, Flushing, 19th] A secret memorandum drafted by the United States was released on the 19th.

If this legal view can be implemented, unless the United Nations General Assembly can plan and facilitate a new government in the Holy Land in advance, the three Western countries will take over the Holy Land when British rule ends.

It is said that the United Kingdom and France are extremely cool to the draft, and even US officials emphasize that the United States is not bound by its terms.

### The Result of the Valuation of the China Textile Corporation Is Submitted for Review; The Total Value of Real Estate Exceeds Two Trillion; The Listing of Shares Can Be Completed Next Month

[Report from Our Own Correspondent] The valuation work for the sale of the China Textile Corporation was formally completed last week. The complete results have been taken to Beijing by a special person for review by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The equipment and plant values of the China Textile Corporation's factories, including those in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin, amounted to more than 193 million yuan based on the currency value of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937); if converted to the current price index, the number is staggering, and the real estate of each factory is not included. During the valuation process, experts believed that the depreciation of the factory equipment value was very important, so the currency value of the 26th year of the Republic of China was used as the standard. The value of the land is determined by the location and utility, so the 4th month of the 36th year of the Republic of China (April 1947) was used as the standard. The total real estate value of each factory is more than two trillion yuan, and the current value is even higher than this number. The principle for the sale of this state-owned enterprise, which was previously decided, is to sell two-thirds of all factories, while the state retains one-third. Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin are all handled according to this ratio, not as rumored, that only northern factories are sold and southern factories are retained. As for what types of factories the state will retain, it is said that the valuation committee has provided a number of specific principles. Generally, the China Textile Corporation's factories that make great contributions to military and civilian use will be retained for the sake of national economy and people's livelihood. At the same time, another principle is that factories that are too large in scale and cannot be purchased and operated by private financial resources will not be sold. In addition, some factories with particularly excellent operating results will also be retained by the public for demonstration purposes. Apart from these, they will be converted to private operation as much as possible. As for the listing of China Textile Corporation's shares, the relevant parties are actively preparing. It is said that there are many looking-on groups of power. Once the majority of the shares for sale can be determined, the shares can be listed immediately. The relevant parties will completely complete this matter within next month.

### Mayor Wu and Governor Chang Continue to Discuss Subsidy Measures for Public Utilities

It is reported that a method of settling foreign exchange one and a half months in advance has been largely decided. The loan issue has also been agreed in principle, but the Central Bank's loan targets are limited to banks and cannot be directly lent to various companies. Therefore, the Municipal Bank will come forward to borrow from the Central Bank, and then lend to various public utility companies. As for the loan method, it is still necessary to study it in detail.

### Completion of Pudong Avenue: Construction of Two Bridges to Begin Soon

### Children's Health and Welfare Institute Resumes Independent Operation and Expands Services

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Children's Health and Welfare Institute, established long ago, was transformed into a municipal institution last year due to insufficient funding, after Chairman Pan Gongzhan of the institute discussed the matter with Mayor Wu. Director Yun Boqin of the institute petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to take over in September of last year. However, after eight months, the bureau only instructed the institute to dismiss staff nurses and return infants. The bureau took over two buildings on Beihai Ning Road and converted them into a labor club. However, the institute's external debts were not fully resolved. The director of the institute believed that health and welfare services were urgently needed and that the authorities had no intention of continuing the operation. Therefore, on March 25 of this year, he petitioned the Municipal Government to resume independent operation. Regarding the debt and building issues, he consulted Chairman Pan, who, to maintain credit, instructed the director of the institute to fully repay the principal and interest. The portion of the debt that the Social Affairs Bureau was supposed to repay was also to be raised and repaid by the institute. Pan also separately petitioned Mayor Wu and Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, requesting that they protect the health and welfare of women and infants and return the institute's buildings. It is reported that the institute's future operations will focus on accepting abandoned infants. It has also decided to establish a demonstration zone for maternal and child health experiments in Hongkou North Sichuan Road and plans to go to Beijing to consult with the Central Hygiene Experimental Institute. It is said that influential figures in the central government have agreed to provide financial support.

### Chairman Chiang Elected President: City to Celebrate with Flags Today

[Our Dispatch] The news that Chairman Chiang had been elected as the first constitutional president of China with an overwhelming majority of votes in the National Assembly was transmitted to Shanghai by radio at 12:55 PM yesterday. This newspaper immediately notified various private and public radio stations to make an emergency extra edition broadcast. The Central Daily News, Heping Daily, and Xinwenbao also immediately published extra editions in red, using several large trucks to deliver them along the main roads. This reporter witnessed crowds thronging Nanjing Road and scrambling to pick up the extra editions to read. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Special Police Department and the union hung huge red banners on Wujin Road and Maigen Road, proclaiming "Celebrating Chairman Chiang's Election as the First President of the Republic of China." Of course, in the eyes of the citizens, the chairman's election was inevitable. Passersby jokingly said, "The chairman's election is not news; not being elected would be news!" However, the new honor of the head of state could not suppress the joy in their hearts. Setting off firecrackers and shouting slogans were just a glimpse of their enthusiasm! The temperament of the Chinese people is relatively calm and not easily agitated, but yesterday was an exception.

Since 9:00 AM yesterday, the radios of major companies and public organizations in the city have been tuned in to listen to this historic news. The moment-by-moment developments in the National Assembly were broadcast to Shanghai by six major radio stations, including Asia-America Record. Around 11:00 AM, it was learned that more than half of the over 2,600 National Assembly delegates had voted. There was a short break in the middle, during which a detailed account of Chairman Chiang's daily life was presented, mentioning that the chairman, having been stationed in the wartime capital for a long time, was fond of Sichuan pickled mustard. At 11:25 AM, the broadcast reported that all voting had been completed. In the following hour, the assembly focused on counting votes, and at 0:24 AM, the prelude to the good news arrived. The broadcast said: Today, the weather in the capital is warm, symbolizing the prosperity of our country in the future. At 0:30 AM, the result that the people of the whole country were concerned about was announced. Chairman Zhou Zhongyue clearly read out in a solemn tone! "Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has been elected as the first President of the Republic of China with 2,430 votes. Mr. Ju Zheng received 269 votes." The radio then broadcast a wave of cheers from the assembly, "Long live the Republic of China!" "Long live the President!"

To express their respect for the head of state, the citizens of Shanghai will celebrate with flags throughout the city today and hold a grand celebration rally. The helmsman who has steered the fate of the nation for twenty years has today been entrusted with new responsibilities by 400 million compatriots. This time, he really wanted to yield to a more capable person, but after all, he could not escape the responsibility of history. "The ship of the nation" is still in dangerous storms today, and it still needs the unity of the people to overcome the difficulties. From the jubilation of the citizens of Shanghai, we see the centripetal force of the nation.

### Shen Shigui and Others Occupy Enemy Property: Imprisonment Ordered After Repeated Refusals to Vacate

[Our Dispatch] Shen Shigui, manager of Tianbao Hall Pharmacy, Li Linfu, manager of Yongfu Electrical Supplies, Shi Zeqing, manager of Shanghai Store, and Tan Zhengyan, manager of Yaguang Dry Cleaning Store, were taken into custody by the District Procuratorate yesterday for refusing to vacate the Ziyuanzhuang houses at 18 Shanyin Road. It is said that during the victory of the 34th year (1945), the defendants, greedy for petty gains, entered into lease agreements with Japanese residents, renting the houses there. Subsequently, the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region took over the properties and put them up for auction. The Central Bank purchased them, but the defendants repeatedly refused to move out despite repeated reminders. The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office of the China Trust Bureau requested instructions from the Executive Yuan, which issued an order stating: "If the contracts for residents using enemy and puppet properties state that the Clearing Office may notify them to vacate one month in advance, the residents should abide by this agreement. Those who stubbornly refuse to move out should be forcibly evicted by the municipal government in accordance with the law, and the residents should not be allowed to gather crowds to coerce or arbitrarily occupy the properties." During the investigation at the District Procuratorate yesterday, the prosecutor urged Shen and others to move out, but their attitude remained unusually tough, so he ordered their imprisonment. The other defendants, Tang Bonian of Xiang Sheng Woodwork Store and Wen Songqing of Henry Watch Store, expressed their willingness to discuss relocation and were released on bail.

### Fourth General Meeting of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Custody Committee Held Yesterday: Three Issues Related to Agriculture, Medicine, etc. Resolved: Utilizing UNRRA Supplies to Manufacture DDT

[Our Dispatch] The Custody Committee of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration held its fourth general meeting yesterday morning, chaired by Zhang Jia-ao. In addition to hearing work reports from the Secretariat of the Custody Committee, the Material Supply General Warehouse, and the Finance Committee, several motions were discussed and the following three issues related to agriculture and medicine were resolved: (1) To plan for drug production, it was decided to utilize the equipment, materials, and raw materials supplied by UNRRA to first organize a company to mass-produce DDT. This company will seek external investment to ensure its permanent existence and achieve corporatization. Although other drugs cannot all be produced by companies at present, they are still being continuously manufactured, with some being done in cooperation with the Ministry of Health.

Swift Processing of Agricultural Reclamation Machinery

(2) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Resources Committee had previously suggested that the Custody Committee establish a chemical fertilizer manufacturing plant. Yesterday's general meeting decided in principle to approve it, and the issue of funding for the plant will first be submitted to the committee's Finance Committee for detailed study. (3) Regarding the handling of UNRRA supplies received by the Agricultural Reclamation Machinery Management Office, it was decided that they should be processed swiftly. (A) Hand tools, livestock tools, well drilling machines, pumps, etc., should be distributed to farmers immediately at low prices. However, Shanghai has other institutions lending equipment, so it should not receive further allocation. (B) Flour mills, cotton gins, oil presses, etc., were previously used by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Farmers Bank, but the results were not satisfactory in terms of fully utilizing them. Therefore, ownership should be reclaimed and allocated to established institutions (such as flour mills, cotton mills, and oil mills). (C) The committee will cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and provincial governments to design agricultural demonstration farms in South China and Taiwan. (D) Agricultural implements shipped from abroad that are not suitable for use in China should all be handed over to the Agricultural Machinery Company to be melted down into iron and manufactured into suitable implements. (E) The committee's agricultural implement repair factory will continue to exist temporarily, but it is hoped that it will be transferred to local industrial institutions or cooperatives at low prices for independent operation in the near future.

Continued Study of Fisheries Enterprises

Regarding the fisheries enterprise issue, a "Fisheries Enterprise Planning Committee" subcommittee has been organized and is currently continuing to study it. In addition, former Director-General of UNRRA, Huo Bian-shu, was originally a Custody Committee member, but after his resignation, Li Zhuomin was transferred to succeed him.

### Fraud Case at Wing On Company: Western Suspect Arrested: Served as Interpreter in Australian Army

[Our Dispatch] On the afternoon of the 13th, Wing On Company was suddenly defrauded of practical items such as shirts and leather shoes worth over 150 million yuan by a Western youth, whose whereabouts were unknown. Afterward, Guo Jianxun, the manager of the company, reported the situation to the Lao Meng Police Station and requested an investigation. Yan Cheng-sheng, the deputy chief of the branch, ordered Jiang Shangpei, the criminal investigation section chief, to solve the case within a time limit. Section member Zong Youlin, Zhang Kuidong, and officers Liu Zongtong and Ma Tianxiong investigated in all directions. Finally, around 12:00 PM yesterday, Section Chief Jiang received a tip-off that the Western conman in the Wing On Company fraud case was hiding in room 421 of the Hui Zhong Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road. He immediately dispatched Section Member Zong and others to the hotel together with Guo, the manager of Wing On Company. They arrested William Thomas Deppson (20 years old), a British-Australian national, and confiscated a large number of stolen goods such as shirts and leather boxes from the room and took them to the bureau together.

According to his confession: He previously worked as an interpreter in the Australian army. He arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong two days ago and opened a room in the Hui Zhong Hotel. Because he was short of money, he first went to Lawrence & Company, a British firm at 222 Sichuan Road, intending to swindle ten watches but failed. Then, he found two blank letterheads of the American Association in the room, and a plan was formed in his mind. He telephoned Wing On Company, impersonating Brown, the secretary of the American Association, falsely claiming that a friend named Siston would come to purchase goods with a letter and requesting them to receive him. After Guo agreed, he happily went and presented the forged Brown letter, selected more than ten pieces of practical items, totaling 157 million yuan in legal tender, and asked them to collect payment from the American Association on Fuzhou Road. The goods were taken away by him. Afterward, the company sent someone to the American Association to collect the money, but they learned that there were no such persons as Brown and Siston, and it was only confirmed that the letterhead did belong to the American Association. They then realized they had been deceived and reported to the police, and he was finally arrested.

### Review Group to Meet Today to Review the Issue of Purchasing Surplus Rice; Chairman of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee Talks About Absolutely No Impact on Rice Prices

The Review Group Meeting, jointly formed by the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the American Chinese Relief Mission, the Audit Department, and other institutions, will convene a regular meeting this afternoon (20th) at the address of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee on Nanjing Road to decide whether to purchase surplus rice from the market. At that time, reporters from this city's newspapers will also be invited to attend to listen to outside opinions.

According to Ren Xiqun, chairman of the Citizens' Food Distribution Committee, told reporters: In the past 50 days, the prices in this city, if compared with rice prices, from the end of February to the 19th, the wholesale price of premium white japonica rice has risen by 30%, and the retail price of special grade japonica rice has risen by 20%. Compared with the rate of increase of other general prices, rice prices are still stable. In the past, the highest amount of rice arriving in the North and South markets each day was more than 20,000 dan, with an average of more than 10,000 dan. Recently, the daily arrival of rice has decreased to less than 5,000 dan. The reason is that transportation costs have soared, and prices in the producing areas have also increased. For example, the price of rice in Wuxi is, on average, 50,000 yuan higher than in this city every day. As a result, the amount of rice transported from Wuxi and other places to Shanghai has been decreasing recently. Rice from Suzhou and Qingpu is also flowing back, being transported to Wuxi instead, because transportation costs are lower, unlike the more difficult transportation from Suzhou River to Shanghai. However, although the arrival of rice in this city has fallen to less than 5,000 dan, there are still 470,000 dan of rice allocated each month, so on average, it can still maintain the highest number of more than 20,000 dan of rice arriving each day. The reason why rice prices can be more stable than other prices lies in this. As for the recent rumors that purchasing surplus rice will stimulate the rise in rice prices, it is not entirely true. The Municipal Government Meeting recently decided that the purpose of purchasing surplus rice is to maintain the source of rice in order to increase reserves. At the same time, it is also preparing for the allocation of rice during the lean months of August and September. Moreover, the rice to be purchased is limited to those remaining requested to be purchased by grain merchants. Therefore, this purchase will definitely not affect rice prices and cause them to fluctuate.

### Cargo Owners Suppress Prices in an Attempt to Sell; Rice Market Psychology is Weak; Oil Market Surges, Prices Increase Unanimously

The market in this city has turned downwards, due to lower prices reported in Wuxi the other day, and prices in Zhoupu and surrounding areas have also fallen. Market psychology is weak. In addition, actual sales are sluggish, and more goods are arriving. Cargo owners are suppressing prices in an attempt to sell. The North Market has fallen more, with high-quality white japonica rice falling by 100,000 yuan, medium and inferior quality rice falling by 150,000 yuan, early thin rice and indica rice both lower by 100,000 yuan, while special grade japonica rice stands firm at 4 million yuan. The South Market has generally fallen by 50,000 yuan, but the market has already rebounded. The People's Livelihood Distribution Committee sold 850 shi of deteriorated japonica rice in the South Market. The total arrival of goods in the two markets was 8,687 shi.

Flour is seeing mixed trends of weakness and firmness. The opening was weak, because prices in Suzhou and Wuxi were weak, and the decline in rice prices made it difficult to boost market psychology. Lao Che flour once fell to 1.38 million yuan, and Bingchuan flour to 1.39 million yuan. Later, merchants slightly bought at lower prices, and Bingchuan flour rose to 1.41 million yuan, and Lao Che flour closed at 1.4 million yuan, each rising by 10,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brand flour fell, with Jiancheng falling by 5,000 yuan and Peacock and other brands falling by 10,000 yuan. Wheat bran also fell by a small amount of 15,000 yuan, and wheat fell to 2 million yuan.

Coarse grains rose unanimously, due to rumors of an increase in foreign exchange rates. Merchants competed to buy first. Soybeans opened flat, but rose by 50,000 yuan due to the patronage of oil factories. Corn was抢购 by the Qingdao merchants and rose sharply by 250,000 yuan. Mung beans rose sharply, increasing by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Selected Qing beans were also acquired by the northern merchants, rising by more than 100,000 yuan. Red beans also rose by 100,000 yuan. Sesame was acquired by the Tianjin merchants, rising sharply by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were拉吸 by the Guangdong merchants and rose wildly again by 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.

Edible oil triggered a violent rise, due to rising raw material prices and strong rumors of higher foreign exchange rates. Market psychology was shaken, and cargo owners held on. Jih Tong raw oil has broken through the 10 million yuan mark, reaching 10.2 million yuan, an increase of 300,000 yuan. Soybean oil rose even more sharply, with Tong Feng Qiu oil initially opening at 8.65 million yuan, then Da Tong opening at 8.8 million yuan, and finally Da You soybean oil changing hands at a high price of 8.95 million yuan, a wild increase of 450,000 yuan. 清油 oil is being acquired for export by Zhongzhi Factory, and the market price is similar to soybean oil, causing all oils to quickly catch up.

### Education and Democracy

— Li Ren

The primary conditions for a people's livelihood-based politics are, first, education, and second, still education. Both the quantity and quality of education are necessary conditions for the success of democratic politics. This principle is too obvious for the author to elaborate on here. The task of this article is by no means to explain the importance of education to democracy (which is universally known), but to explain a contradictory phenomenon in which contemporary democratic countries neglect education while loudly advocating democracy.

Among contemporary democratic countries, the United States is naturally second to none. The United States not only considers itself the most democratic country (which may indeed be the case), but also takes on the great responsibility of safeguarding democracy, promoting democracy, and educating other countries in democracy. In order to save democracy, the United States participated in the First World War and then in the Second World War. We should not forget the United States' contribution to democratic politics. We cannot but thank the United States; it is indeed the savior of democratic countries. However, while the United States is loudly advocating democracy, a major crisis has occurred in American education, and the American authorities have neglected education, which cannot but be surprising. If this were said by us or by people from other countries, it might be considered malicious propaganda. But the person who said this, the person who said that there was a crisis in American education, is not a foreigner, but an American educator. American educator Benjamin Fine published a book last year called "Our Children Are Cheated." The author has not seen this book. The author has only seen a book review published by Lucy Sprague Mitchell in the February 7th issue of the "Saturday Review of Literature." This book review slightly reveals the content of the book.

According to Fine's investigation, a major crisis has occurred in American education after the war. Schools at all levels across the United States, from kindergartens to universities, are generally experiencing a shortage of teachers. As a result of the shortage of teachers, 6,000 schools have closed. Most of the teachers hired by schools that have not closed are also unqualified. Before the war, only one in 400 teachers was unqualified, but now it is one in seven. The number of teachers who have switched from other professions is also twice as high as before the war. When the war broke out in 1941, 350,000 teachers across the United States left the classroom, but only a very small number returned to the classroom after the war. At the same time, the number of students currently enrolled in American normal colleges is far less than before the war, but the number of students at all levels is rapidly increasing. This teacher shortage phenomenon will inevitably become more serious. Why is there a teacher shortage in the United States? Why are Americans unwilling to become teachers? Fine tells us that this is because American teachers are paid too little. Currently, the income in the American education sector is far lower than the income in the industrial sector. Taking last year alone, the average salary of teachers across the United States was about $40 per week per person. However, there were 10,000 teachers who earned less than $12 per week, and another 200,000 who earned only $25 or less per week. Such an amount makes it difficult for even unmarried teachers to make a living, let alone the fact that most teachers have family responsibilities. Therefore, teachers in many parts of the United States have gone on strike to demand pay raises. Moreover, American teachers not only have low salaries, but also low social status. Many places do not respect the status of teachers. Teachers are often dismissed once they get married. There are also those who tell teachers not to smoke, tell teachers not to drink in public places, tell teachers which church to attend, tell teachers to do this and do that; as for important educational policies, many teachers are not even consulted. Isn't this a disregard for the personality and status of teachers? In addition, school equipment is far inferior to what it was before the war. Many primary and secondary school buildings are very dilapidated, without sanitary facilities, and without libraries or laboratories. Universities are also overcrowded and do not have the money to build more school buildings. It is truly hard to believe that the educational situation of the richest and strongest democratic country in the world is like this. Therefore, Mitchell said with emotion: "This is a strange picture book of one of the richest and most prosperous nations on earth. This nation has long regarded universal education as a cornerstone of democracy, and universal education is particularly needed as the atomic age begins. There has never been a time when there has been such a great need to understand science as it is now, and there has never been a time when there has been such a broad recognition of the need to understand our own democratic culture and the cultures of other countries. Our country is struggling to achieve its new position in the world and is working to explain democracy to other nations. But at such a critical juncture, we are cheating our children in education, and therefore cheating democracy and cheating the world. Indeed, this is a scene that we all should rise up and do something about."

After reading the above report, what are our thoughts? We are naturally not qualified to criticize British education. Our education, in terms of quality and quantity, is far behind the United States. Strictly speaking, our education is simply equal to zero. But we are also learning from the United States and starting to talk about democracy. The National Assembly is in session and is planning to lay the foundation for our country's democratic politics. But what about education, which is the foundation of democratic politics? Students are on strike, teachers are on strike, and teachers across the country are struggling on the poverty line. According to the above statistics, the minimum wage for American teachers is at least $50 per month. The highest salary for teachers in our country, in terms of university professors, is still less than $30 per month (black market price). With such developed education in the United States, Americans are still shouting "cheating children, cheating democracy, cheating the world." So, what should we say ourselves? Let the representatives of the National Assembly and the government authorities say it themselves! The author doesn't need to say it!

### Schopenhauer's Theory of Art

— Shao Xiong

The activity of art is different from the activity of science in its method. The artist's selection of subject matter is to take a particular person or thing, and strive to express it as a separate entity, and use the most accurate way to express all its particularities, even the most subtle particularities. Science is different. Science deals with abstract concepts, and each concept represents a number of individuals; for these concepts, science defines them and indicates their characteristics. We can say that the method of art focuses on the particular, and the method of science focuses on the universal. However, we cannot therefore say that art is a meaningless, trivial, or even childish pursuit. Because the nature of art is to represent thousands of examples with one example, to carefully and thoroughly express the single individual, person or thing, and thereby to show the class concept to which this person or thing belongs. For example, to faithfully and completely describe an event or a state of a person's life is to appropriately reveal all the individuals that constitute this event as this event, and we can obtain a clear and in-depth insight into the concept of human nature itself from this particular point of view. Therefore, although the methods of art and science are different, they have much in common in dealing with individual facts. The botanist's study of plants is to take a flower from the infinite plant kingdom and study it, analyze this flower, and use it as a sample to prove the nature of the plant itself from this single sample. The poet is the same. The poet selects a certain scene, a certain state, a certain feeling from the noisy and infinite human life, and from it shows us what human life and characteristics are. From this point of view, both science and art go from the particular to the universal.

Beauty is form, is the archetype, so Schopenhauer believes that the expression of art lies in trying to separate form and matter. The element of art lies in this separation, because the purpose of art is to enable us to obtain knowledge of form or archetype. The element of a work of art lies first in giving us the form but not the matter, and second in making it impossible for the viewer to mistake it for matter. Therefore, a wax figure of a person or thing cannot produce a sense of beauty and cannot be regarded as a work of art, because it is very easy for us to mistake it for a real person or thing. It not only gives us the form, but also gives us the matter. The so-called form is not only geometrical, but also philosophical, so color, plane, structure, etc. can also be regarded as form. The marble sculpture gives us pure form, and the colored oil painting also gives us pure form. We will not mistake the people or things in the oil painting for real ones.

The main part of Schopenhauer's essay is briefly described above. This theory of art may not be agreed upon by modern artists, but it is undoubtedly a theory that is worth our attention. (To be continued)

### Random Talks in the Academic World (16)

— Zhang Qiyun

"Freedom of the Press"

The ideal of democracy must be entrusted to sound public opinion. Without freedom of speech, democratic politics cannot survive. President Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) of the United States made the most significant contributions to safeguarding the news and publishing industries. He once said: "National authority belongs to the people." "The people can use newspapers to supervise the government, and the government can also use newspapers to fully report the actual situation of government affairs to the people." "If speech can be free and everyone can read newspapers, this is the safest path." In a letter to E. Carington on January 16, 1786, Jefferson said: "If newspapers and government cannot coexist and one must be removed, we should not hesitate to remove the government and keep the newspapers." His attitude was so firm. He also said: "Newspapers are the most effective tool for enlightening the people. To make the general public rational, moral, and public-spirited, we must rely on the power of newspapers." Every president of the United States has attached great importance to the press. In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt said, "The most important profession in the United States is the reporter, including magazine editors. Periodicals that are popular throughout the country are particularly worthy of attention." Democracy and the press are interdependent.

The late Adolph Simon Ochs (born 1858, died 1935), the host of the New York Times, was an extremely important figure in the history of the American press and made many contributions to improving the standards of the press. When he took over the New York Times in 1896, he had a motto that read: "The editing of news should be concise and interesting, and its wording should be acceptable to the upper class. The transmission of news should be as rapid as possible, and its selection of materials should be impartial, without bias, without jealousy, and without being blinded by partisanship. All major public issues can be discussed in this newspaper as a forum for open discussion by informed people to reflect different opinions in society." This passage seems plain, but it is not easy to put it into practice. In summary, sincerity, fairness, conscientiousness, discernment, and erudition are the five requirements that Ochs advocated for journalists. Journalism has become a specialized academic discipline in modern times, originating in the United States, and the New York Times is the largest laboratory. With reliability, impartiality, and erudition as the criteria for evaluation, the newspaper is truly the leading newspaper in the United States. In terms of its scale and equipment, even the London Times pales in comparison.

Now is the era of global village, and the first-class major newspapers must have a global nature, so the source of news has become a major issue at present. In September 1944, the United States Congress passed a resolution stating that there is a responsibility to exchange news internationally, that journalists from all countries should have the convenience of collecting and disseminating news, and that governments of all countries should not discriminate. Modern international relations are extremely complex, and all nations can increase their mutual understanding by exchanging facts and ideas. The free flow of news is an important factor in maintaining world peace. The United States is currently initiating the conclusion of an international agreement called the Freedom of the Press Agreement. This agreement will guarantee journalists the freedom from censorship, but exceptions will be made for what is necessary for national military security. Whether the proposition of freedom of the press can succeed is of course not unconditional, and the efforts of the publishing industry itself are particularly important.

Responsible freedom is the tradition of Western culture. President Roosevelt proclaimed the Four Freedoms, the first of which was freedom of speech and expression. (Freedom of speech and expression) The spirit of responsibility is the price that freedom of speech must pay. Recently, the University of Chicago accepted a donation of $200,000 from Time magazine and Encyclopaedia Britannica, designated as the expenses of the "Freedom of Expression Research Association," and the scope of research also covers radio, film, and the book industry. The committee of 13 people is chaired by Robert H. Hutchins, honorary president of the University of Chicago, and W.E. Hocking, retired professor of philosophy at Harvard University, is also a member. The research results were written into a report by Hocking, entitled "Freedom of the Press." (Published in Chicago in 1947) Its conclusion is that the crisis of freedom of speech lies in the publishing industry itself. It is not enough to say that totalitarian countries prohibit the publication of dissenting opinions. However, if freedom is abused without restriction, or if the news is reversed, or if it is exaggerated and exaggerated, or if it promotes racial prejudice, or if it incites hatred between people, or if it caters to vulgarity and is willing to be inferior, that is, the so-called yellow journalism, all of these are latent crises in the newspaper industry. In the 19th century, individual freedom was regarded as supremely important, but now the public interest and social security should at least be as important as individual freedom. Any freedom is conditional, and it is necessary to correct the deficiencies and remedy the abuses. The publishing industry has failed to fulfill its responsibilities, and this is not only a matter for newspaper editors alone, but also for the government, society, and readers. The United States is the country that most values freedom of speech, but how to achieve a perfect and harmonious balance between freedom and responsibility is still a problem to be solved. Responsible freedom is originally an ideal, and it should also be an endless effort for mankind.

### The Psychology of Rumors (3)

— Fang Zheng

In the previous article, we have pointed out that rumors produce the characteristics of "exaggeration, distortion, understanding, and complexity" due to the recycling effect in memory. General images are conceptualized, and individuality is immersed in types. The more vague and empty the image, the easier it is to go down this path, and rumors breed in this ambiguous consciousness.

For example, when we talk about ancient beauties, we have no concrete impression in our minds, because no one has ever seen them with their own eyes, so we are very likely to conceptualize them, so there are boundless words such as "one point taller is too long, one point shorter is too short, one point fatter is too fat, and one point thinner is too thin." In other words, we only know that she is extremely beautiful—a typical beauty—not too tall, not too short, not too fat, not too thin. The result is naturally "exaggeration" and "distortion." Precisely because we only have a vague impression, everything is empty, and reverie is very convenient to add color to these frameworks. The so-called understanding, also known as embellishment, fabrication, and naturally tends to be complex. Therefore, the more there is no real news and the more scarce the news, the more rumors will arise. The best way to put out rumors is of course to open up the truth as much as possible.

In this way, we can understand why rumors are most popular in wartime and in the army. Military secrets shroud all actions, and everything is in "keeping a tight lip." At the same time, because of the imminent dangers and personal interests, everyone is eager to know the current situation and current actions. On the one hand, there is an urgent need for knowledge, and on the other hand, "silence is golden," and it is impossible to figure out the situation, so rumors prevail. "Winds come from empty caves," and rumors are of course due to the lack of news, but people's desire for news is even more of a root cause of rumors.

From the perspective of social psychology, the creators and disseminators of rumors often have their functions. Listening to rumors or accepting rumors is of course due to a psychological desire, and creating or disseminating rumors is also to satisfy another psychological desire. This is people's desire to win. Being able to say what others do not know and showing that one's news is well-informed seems to be a way to stand out. It is only for this kind of coercion that the spread of rumors is faster than "sending messages by post." Some rumors spread faster than news. (To be continued)

### Lao Tzu on Tao, Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Wisdom

— Yan Qun

Lao Tzu's discussion of Tao, Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Wisdom says: "After losing Tao, then comes Virtue; after losing Virtue, then comes Benevolence; after losing Benevolence, then comes Righteousness; after losing Righteousness, then comes Propriety. Propriety is the thinness of loyalty and sincerity, and the beginning of chaos; Foresight is the flower of Tao, and the beginning of foolishness; Therefore, the great man dwells in the thick and does not dwell in the thin; he dwells in the real and does not dwell in the flower; therefore, he discards that and takes this." (Chapter 38) Now, I interpret its meaning to see Lao Tzu's profound intention.

This chapter discusses the traces of the evolution of human affairs: from mixed to painted, from combined to separated, from pure to mixed, from simple to flowery. At the beginning of the Tao body, it is mixed and simple, a state of stillness; it turns into movement, spreads and people and things are born. Man is also a realm of natural operation, and shares the Tao body with things as virtue. In the beginning, it is not far from the Tao, and the virtue is complete and each gets its place, and they are mixed together and can accommodate each other. As time goes on, virtue may be lost, and there are those who do not get their place, then they do not accommodate each other and disputes arise; the sage often advocates benevolence, hoping that those who have lost their place can accommodate each other, and the disputes can be eliminated - this is why benevolence saves the loss of virtue. Benevolence is love, and only love can accommodate each other. Virtue is lost, and benevolence is advocated to make up for it; but the art of making up for it has a limited use, so righteousness is advocated to relieve its poverty. Righteousness is the way to make it appropriate. Because benevolence has the intention of using love, its love is often difficult to spread, not as good as those who have complete virtue who have no intention of accommodating each other, and are mixed together and can accommodate each other; then establish righteousness to show the thickness and difference of love, hoping that among those whose love is not widespread, those who are reached, the difference in thickness and thinness can get their due, then those who have lost virtue, although they cannot be mixed together and accommodate each other, have the love of thickness and difference between them, which is still better than nothing. But if there is a difference in thickness and thinness, then the festivals arise, and propriety arises. Righteousness is the way to make the difference in thickness and thinness appropriate, and propriety is the festival of righteousness. Moreover, the difference in thickness and thinness is a matter of difference; if there is a difference, then there can be no intention; if there is intention, then there is sincerity and falsehood. The festivals that show the difference in thickness and thinness are often not sincere or true, and falsehood and deception are often written about here, which is why propriety is "the thinness of loyalty and sincerity, and the beginning of chaos". "Loyalty and sincerity" means sincerity, and the practice of propriety is often insufficient, so it is said that "the thinness of loyalty and sincerity". If loyalty and sincerity are thin, then fraud and pretense arise; fraud and falsehood are the steps of contention; therefore, it is said that "the beginning of chaos". Foresight is a matter of wisdom. The smallness of wisdom does not see the whole Tao, and has not obtained "this discipline" (see Chapter 14), and often holds on to the ancient and controls the present (ask above), pretending to be foresight, not knowing that the mechanism between cause and effect is very subtle, and its affairs are very quiet, using wisdom to play tricks, its effect is clumsy, because what it knows in the former is not the reality of Tao, and the wisdom of the district is enough to nourish its foolishness, so it is said that "foresight is the flower of Tao, and the beginning of foolishness". "The great man" is a scholar who is determined to learn the Tao. "Thick" means morality; "thin" means benevolence, righteousness and propriety. "Real" is Tao; "flower" is wisdom. Those who study the Tao embrace the reality of morality, their pure heart is mixed together and accommodates things, without intimacy or alienation between them, without the use of benevolence, righteousness, propriety and wisdom, so it is said that "discard that and take this" - "this" is morality, "that" is benevolence, righteousness, propriety and wisdom.

Tao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are the essentials of life, so Lao Tzu's discussion of life first marks these numbers, clarifies the order of their occurrence, and sees the end of the root, and then knows what to discard and take. Only Lao Tzu values morality and despises benevolence, righteousness, propriety and wisdom. Because in the late Zhou Dynasty, fraud and falsehood flourished, and contention arose greatly, the Confucianists advocated benevolence, righteousness, propriety and wisdom to save it, but its effect was only enough to nourish chaos and separation, Lao Tzu immediately established its root, clarified the essentials of morality, hoping that people would return to simplicity and change customs. Lao Tzu knew that the movement of the world often goes back and forth between combination and separation, and governance and chaos. In the late Zhou Dynasty, separation and chaos had reached their extreme, and the situation should be reversed. Lao Tzu then pretended to establish words to assist in the reversal, so that the people would be spared from suffering, and his intention can be said to be bitter.

### "Losing a Book is Like Losing an Old Friend"

— Tizhai

It seems like a line from Fangweng's poem: "Gaining a sword is like adding a strong servant, losing a book is like losing an old friend." This resonates deeply with those of us who have collected old books and experienced hardship. In my youth, after reading the postscript of the "Jin Shi Lu," I often sighed at the experiences of Yi'an Jushi. However, I did not fully understand the joy of brewing tea and composing poems in the Guilai Hall, only the grief and indignation of national sentiments. As I grew older, personal gains and losses became a concern, adding another layer of emotion. Although this stems from my ego, it reflects the sorrows and joys of middle age. There is no need to hide it, nor to explain it further.

China is a country with many disasters, a long history, and much culture, which is both endearing and heartbreaking. Wars are often waged with the goal of destruction, while lovers of antiquities try to salvage remnants from the smoke and flames, creating a tragic atmosphere from the start. The tiny fragments rescued with great effort are often lost in unavoidable circumstances, leading to indescribable frustration. Luo Xuetang described in his "Fifty Days of Dream Traces" the fragments of oracle bones found in Anyang. They were scattered everywhere in the fields, and he collected dozens of sacks. These are the raw materials for the "Shuqi Qianhou Bian," now worth over ten million. Similarly, Luo saw in the archives of the Ministry of Education dozens of sacks of files from the Grand Secretariat, already packed and waiting to be sold by weight as waste paper. Thanks to his efforts, they were purchased and preserved, becoming the numerous volumes of Ming and Qing historical materials published by the Commercial Press today. And countless more remain unorganized. Recently, we heard that a large collection of Luo's antiquities in his Lushun residence was taken away by truck after the victory. Because the load was too heavy, some were abandoned along the road. Fortunately, Luo died before this happened; otherwise, wouldn't he have wailed loudly in his "Collected Articles" (his autobiography)? I heard that his son, Fuyi, has been appointed to teach at Peking University. He will surely write another poignant essay for people to sigh and mourn over, right? In the past, I read Chen Dengyuan's "Study on the Collection and Dispersal of Chinese Classics" and learned that the so-called "Five Disasters of Niu Hong" are commonplace in China. The Song dynasty woodblock-printed books from the Haiyuan Pavilion of the Yang family in Liaocheng were used as waste paper to wipe opium pipes by Liu Zhendian's remnants and bandits, demonstrating the extravagance of our nation. Ji Wenda Gong once said, "How easily one speaks of the fleeting nature of mountains and rivers, but seeing the Gongyang Commentary, I cannot restrain my tears." That was only because he saw servants using the Song edition of the Gongyang Commentary to wrap snacks. It was not even used to wipe opium tools. If Wenda were alive three hundred years later, what lamentations would he make!

Indeed, books stacked on the desk are not necessarily read or used every day, but it is like a wealthy person with banknotes. Having more is not necessarily for spending, and looking at them is a pleasure. Thus, a love for wealth becomes a leisure pursuit, not necessarily for its practical value. Collecting books is probably the same. However, because we know a few characters and have not learned to trade on the exchange or possess the wealth-accumulating skills of Mr. Zigong, we still rely on books to write or deceive people for a living. Our longing for books is more urgent than utilitarianism, akin to the poor's need for rice, salt, firewood, and clothing. It is like being hungry and cold without food or clothing, and this suffering is different from that of aesthetes. Therefore, if books are likened to good friends, I remember those who can help with financial difficulties, not just companions for leisurely conversations on a clear night. Perhaps some will laugh at this as vulgar, but that is the reality, so what can be done?

My personal study is quite eclectic, dabbling in everything. I admire the narrow and deep studies of scholars, but I am also somewhat afraid. This is because I feel that "focusing one's will" is a synonym for dryness and simplicity, something that common people dare not aspire to. Therefore, the scope of my book buying is virtually unlimited. Except for physics, mathematics, and other subjects that I do not understand, I do not reject anything that can increase my general knowledge. In the past, books were really cheap. The Complete Works of Lu Xun sold for twenty yuan and could be discounted by 18%, costing only sixteen yuan, which is equivalent to sixteen million today! That's a million times difference! Can anyone believe this? Recently, because I needed to teach a little history and delve into archaeology and historical materials, I thought of the "Zhou Jin Wen Cun" and "Yizhai Jigu Lu," which I bought for twenty-four and ten-odd yuan in legal tender. The "San Dai Ji Jin Wen Cun" in the Sanma Road store costs as much as twenty million, leaving me speechless! The other day, the bookstore wrote to me, informing me that they had received several volumes of the "Oriental Studies Journal," each priced at 250,000! These are things I was unwilling to spend money on before. Any kind of Qing dynasty notebook in engraved form, with only a few volumes, costs over 300,000 to 400,000. A friend told me the other day that he bought a series of books on the Qing dynasty's tributary states for over 100,000 yuan at a cold stall in Suzhou, which is a rare opportunity. It is a pity that there is no one like Zhang Tingji, who recorded the market price every day and month (Zhang's "Qing Yi Ge Ancient Artifact Writings" all record the prices) for reference in future generations! Not even further back, just based on the changes in the last three years, it is already like a distant era!

The only books I have are all in my hometown. Calculating, it has been over ten years since I last saw them. First, the Japanese came, wanting to burn and search. Many magazines and new books were lost in the flames of war. Then, the war expanded, and the place where the books were stored became a ruin of war, and the little that was left was taken away by thieves. Finally, after the restoration of the country, new flames of war came, making it impossible to even visit. This fully embodies the "remembering" in "remembering an old friend." However, there is no shortage of good friends returning from airplanes and ships. Even if they have gone through great hardships, everyone can shake hands and laugh, or, like visiting old places and finding half of them ghosts, burst into tears in familiar places. Those old friends without knowledge can never return! If they were conscious, what would they think when they were reduced to ashes or transferred to the hands of a new friend? As far as I know, the new owners of the books have generally changed their nature. They are either from the stock exchange or partners in cotton yarn or soap factories. In the past, poor scholars often liked to write a couplet for themselves, saying, "The book field has no tax for descendants to cultivate." I advise you scholars to give up. Although there are no golden houses in books, books do not enter without golden houses. They have become Ajiao in the cultural marketplace!

### On Suicide

— Haiyan

Recently, there have been suicides among male and female students in various places—student suicides have been seen frequently in recent years. However, this time it has prompted everyone to study the reasons for suicide. In fact, there is no need to study the reasons. Is it not clear? Society is such a society.

Instead, it is somewhat interesting to analyze the psychology of those who commit suicide from the perspective of their attitude towards life. Students are intellectuals, different from the "common men and women who hang themselves in ditches" among wealthy daughters or humble women, who do so purely because of simple minds. It is generally speculated that the reason for suicide is "pessimism" and "feeling that life is boring." However, I feel that those who truly feel pessimistic and bored with life may not resolutely seek death; on the contrary, most of them probably have many hopes for the world and have considerable interest in life. As a result, when despair comes, they demand a final accounting of themselves, demand repayment of what they are owed by hope, and end it with death. Of course, there are also those like Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who have long felt weary of life and die calmly, but they are not the majority.

Those with a pessimistic outlook on life generally adopt chronic suicide. It is not easy to change the views of such people; however, those who commit suicide immediately after being stimulated can be saved: as long as they are given a way to vent, they can be transformed into warriors who actively fight against the evil forces of the world. Because the more someone has no attachment to the world, the more it reflects that before despair, they were very attached to and fond of the world, no, very affectionate; otherwise, they would not have the determination to commit suicide and would have long ago committed chronic suicide. Suicides often leave behind farewell letters, which can be taken as evidence; if they do not feel that there is still any "taste" in the world, or anything to be missed, why leave such a trace in the world? The letter itself is "taste," still "left" to those who can be "missed" in a broad sense. Therefore, if it is possible to give them a greater "taste," and this "taste" can eliminate all the factors that make the environment dull, why can't their thought of eternal life be restored?

The question is how to make them get a greater taste - the opportunity to fight life.

### On Not Being Able to Write

— Yun Gong

I have always adhered to one principle when it comes to writing, which is that I will not write when I cannot write. And when I do write, I stop when I have said what I want to say, and I never drag on or pad out the article. Sometimes, at the request of an editor, there are exceptions where I have to write an impromptu piece in a hurry, which is unavoidable. That often embarrasses me, because when I can't write, I really can't write a single word.

Once, my thoughts were difficult, and the editor's deadline was pressing. I had to submit the manuscript the next morning. I didn't have any inspiration until I went to see a movie at a theater that night. Five minutes before the movie started, I suddenly had an epiphany. I then used a pencil to write the manuscript in a notebook that I carried with me.

Usually, when I have the time or interest to write but can't, I also have my own coping methods, because I feel that it is not easy to find the time to write, and I should not miss the opportunity when I have a moment of free time. At this time, I often take out a beautifully bound and well-printed single volume by a popular writer to read. The content of his articles can inspire me. And the mere fact that he can publish such a book can also arouse my competitive spirit. Under this stimulation, the article is forced out.

Some people also say that the reason why they can't write is that they can't find a suitable topic. This requires constant attention. I often record the topics I plan to write about in a small notebook. Usually, there are only one or two stars of thoughts, which, when written, are about fifty or sixty words to one or two hundred words, not enough for a short article. Here, I feel that writing articles is like rolling a snowball, the more you roll, the more you get. When you have collected enough material, an article is produced.

In short, although writing is a minor skill, its principles seem to be applicable to handling any matter. In recent years, American industry and commerce have been studying vocational training, occupational relationships, occupational methods, and other items. Those in charge of these matters must pay attention to observation, record at any time, and analyze at any time. I think that with their experience, they will definitely be able to write a good article, and except for the author who is just filling in the numbers, those who write good articles must also be able to understand things by analogy and have a higher understanding than others.

### The President and the Church

— Mao Yi

American presidents, like ordinary people, are also followers of Jesus Christ. However, they belong to different churches; among them, Presbyterians are the most numerous, with six in total. Unitarians have four, Episcopalians have two, and Congregationalists, Quakers, Disciples of Christ, and Dutch Reformed each have one. Other presidents do not belong to any church, although they also attend church services. Truman's church is the "First Baptist Church" in Washington, a 144-year-old red brick building eight blocks from the White House.

In the early days, pastors often felt nervous and apprehensive about the chief executive's attendance. One Episcopalian pastor named Abercrombie always asked President Washington, who was seated in the front row, to leave whenever Holy Communion was about to begin. Later, Washington simply stopped going to church on Communion Sundays.

When Lincoln was running for Congress and had not yet entered the White House, he had a contest with Peter Cartwright, a Methodist minister. Cartwright often criticized Lincoln's "irreligious attitude." When the campaign began, Cartwright held a series of faith revival services. At one such service, Lincoln was also present, sitting in the back of the hall. During his sermon, Cartwright said to the audience, "Please stand up if you want to go to heaven." Everyone stood up, except for Lincoln, who remained seated.

Cartwright continued, "Please stand up if you want to go to hell." Lincoln still sat motionless.

So Cartwright announced, "Everyone except Mr. Lincoln has stood up once; we would like to know where he hopes to go."

Lincoln stood up and said calmly, "I want to go to Congress." With that, he left.

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Many things from the distant past still seem like yesterday, but some things that really happened yesterday already seem like a hundred years ago.

In the desert, a drop of water is more precious than a pearl. In the desert of a heart without friendship, a nod or half a smile is stronger than many clever compliments, thunderous applause...

Truly compassionate people give "sympathy," while philanthropists only give "pity."

Some people are so good that they are annoying, and some people are so bad that they are lovable—most people secretly prefer the latter to the former—alas, the human heart has declined to this point.

When children are just beginning to understand things, adults teach them "honesty"; once children grow up and enter the world, they teach them to learn "hypocrisy."

### The World's Most Vicious Woman

— Ruyi

Around 1901, a widow named Belle Gunness moved to La Porte, Indiana, USA. She placed numerous marriage advertisements in newspapers and magazines, saying that she was willing to marry a man with a gentle personality who could pay her a deposit. In fact, Gunness was already forty-two years old that year, but surprisingly, men who responded to the advertisement kept coming. After these brave men arrived at her lonely farm, she always asked them to take out the money for the deposit first. Once the money was in hand, she immediately killed the man and secretly buried him. Over the course of seven years, more than forty men died at her hands! The total amount of money she swindled from these forty-odd men was over US$100,000.

By 1908, the local district chief finally became suspicious and wanted to investigate the widow's actions closely. Unexpectedly, she had already gotten wind of it. She set fire to her farm and fled far away, managing to escape the clutches of the law.

"Boos" at the National Assembly Hall have created a special record since the beginning of "booing." A male representative said, "I also agree, why boo me!" A female representative said, "Wait until I finish speaking before you boo!" And in the midst of "Boo! Boo!" she calmly finished her speech. Another female representative said, "Female representatives speak on behalf of your wives, please do not give contemptuous boos." These are all excellent words. Because the "boos" were incessant and everyone "booed," a "counter-boo struggle" program was established. According to the previous commonness that "boos" are often heard in movie theaters, when villains do bad things or during tense situations, they originate from all around the seats, mostly from children. As for the parliamentary halls in the early years of the Republic of China, they occasionally happened, and undoubtedly expressed emotions of disgust, or implied discouragement. In the dictionary, the sound is the same as "xu," and its meaning is "to blow," and a more detailed explanation, a taboo is called blowing, slowing is called "xu." Puckering lips is called blowing, a hollow mouth is called "xu." Therefore, although the two words "blowing" and "xu" are often connected, each has its meaning. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties period, when Liang Houjing ascended the Taiji Hall, his crowd "blew their lips and made noises to go up," then "blowing" was used to express joy, and "xu" was used to express disgust, both being the instinct of human organs, arising from nature. As for the common usage of entrusting someone to say good things as "blowing and praising," it is a habitual usage, no different from "propaganda, propaganda."

### Two Poems on a Cold Night

— Chen Meng'an

How cold it is to be here, the four walls are silent, thinking of sleeplessness at dawn, and deeply worried, I am startled; hearing the crane's cry for a thousand years, the rooster's crow alerts me at dawn, how foolishly laughable, I chant poetry to send the short watch.

Suffering pervades heaven and earth, solid ice gradually frosts, encountering a vast wilderness, as if coming out of a dry and dark village, enduring the cold, I know its weight, passing through the heart, the night is longer, the plan for rice and grain is undecided, and the migrating geese bitterly follow the sun.

### Picture of Han Hui Building by Da Youhan for the Jizhiguanshi

Leisurely mulberry fields are suitable for ten acres, ancient trees for a hundred-year term, the picture shows a house by the river outside the city, and I often remember the blue lamp and yellow scrolls; Tongde can accommodate the road for four horses, and writing esoteric texts also requires self-deprecating words, bidding farewell and driving again as a Spring Shen guest, the empty water is clear and sends dreams.

### Mistaken Characters

— Yi Yun

People nowadays often laugh at others for "writing wrong characters" (wrong characters are commonly mistaken for blank characters). For example, if a certain character should be written in a certain way, but is mistakenly written as another character, they laugh at it as "writing a wrong character." If a certain character should be read in a certain sound, but is mistakenly read in another sound, they laugh at it as "reading a wrong character." In fact, the number of characters in our country is numerous, and one character has multiple ways of writing, multiple pronunciations, and multiple meanings. Even scholars cannot fully know them all, let alone ordinary people.

The "mai" character in the name of the modern celebrity Zhang Junmai should have been read as "mai." Because this character is almost the same as the "li" character, it is common for people to mistakenly read it as the "li" sound. (Editor's note: When the China Democratic Socialist Party was first established in 1946, I went to the party headquarters on Yuyuan Road to visit Mr. Zhang and Mr. Xu Mengyan. Unexpectedly, the clerk there also loudly called him "Mr. Junli," which was shocking.) The two characters "mao dun" (contradiction) have become a catchphrase today. The character "dun" should be read as "zhun" with a rising tone, or read as "yun" (see the dictionary), but many people read it as "tun" with a rising tone. This is because in the Spring and Autumn period, the "dun" character in Zhao Dun's name was originally read as "tun" with a rising tone, and it is the same character. Therefore, without seeking a thorough understanding, they read it casually. According to the origin of the two characters "mao dun," they come from Han Feizi's "Using your spear to pierce your shield." This "dun" character cannot be read in the same sound as the "dun" of Zhao Dun. Because there are fewer people who read Han Feizi, more people read Zuo Zhuan, and especially more people read the old novel "Chronicles of the States," resulting in the mistaken mixing of pronunciations. Also, many people know that "he gu cai" (water chestnut) sold by Hongxing Pharmacy is read as "zhe," but some people mistakenly read it as "shu." A few months ago, there was a movie called "Su Feng Ji." "Su" should be read as "su," but some people also read it as "sheng." This is "a scholar does not know characters, only continues half of the text." Therefore, I will record a few of the laughable mistaken characters as follows:

A certain noble family declined, and its descendants wanted to sell the porcelain from the Song and Ming kilns collected by their ancestors. Therefore, they posted an advertisement in front of the door. However, they did not know many characters, and the "yao" (kiln) character was mistakenly written as "yin" (promiscuous). The text of the advertisement was "Selling ancient promiscuous utensils, Ming promiscuous, Ding promiscuous, Xuan promiscuous, Ge promiscuous, Ru promiscuous, all are available," which made the viewers laugh.

During the early Republic of China, the warlord Jiang Guiti did not know how to read. When he went to Rehe to take office as the governor, he was very happy on the day he took office, saying that he saw many shops along the street making signs with the two characters "Gui Ti" and hanging them high to express their welcome. Those who heard this were confused. After careful investigation, they suddenly realized that the so-called "Gui Ti" signs were the shop signs of noodle shops, the two characters "gua mian" (hanging noodles).

Gang Yi, a Manchu official in the Qing Dynasty, was the Minister of Justice and compared himself to Gao Tao in the Shun era, but he mistakenly read the "Tao" character as the "Tao" in Tao Yuanming. Whenever he reported the death of prisoners, he always changed the "yu" (died in prison) character to "shou" (thin). When Sichuan reported chasing and suppressing foreign barbarians, there was the phrase "chasing and fleeing north," and Gang Yi thought it was a mistake for "chasing and comparing the barbarians," saying that it referred to chasing and comparing the things looted by the barbarians.

When Cao Kun was imprisoned, he liked to write letters for people, and he often signed himself as "Bo Sou." This is because Cao was from Xigu in Tianjin, and Xigu is located on the coast of the Bohai Sea. Once, for some reason, he mistakenly wrote the water radical of the "Bo" character on the left of the "Sou" character, becoming "Bo Sou." The commentators then quoted the idiom "cow dung and horse burdock" to mock him.
