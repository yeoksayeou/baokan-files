### The Executive Yuan Passes General Rules and Outline for Rationing in Five Cities; Rationing Can Begin, Requiring 352,000 Tons in April

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] The case of rationing grain in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou has been discussed by the Ministry of Food, together with the China Relief Mission of the United States, the mayors of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, and related agencies. General rules for grain rationing in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou have been drafted. Furthermore, an outline of a plan for rationing grain in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, drafted by the China Relief Mission of the United States, has been amended and approved by the Grain Rationing Conference of the Five Cities and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which approved the full text of the general rules and the plan outline at its 44th meeting on the 24th, as follows:

General Rules for the Rationing of Food for Residents of the Five Cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou

Article 1: The government, in order to ration food for the residents of the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, establishes these general rules.

Article 2: The affairs of rationing food for residents of the five cities shall be the responsibility of the mayors of each city, who shall establish a Food Allocation Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Allocation Committee") to handle them. If a city already has a food allocation organization, it may submit a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to handle food rationing matters without establishing a Food Allocation Committee.

Article 3: The Mayor may concurrently serve as the Chairman of the Food Allocation Committee, and may appoint one or two Deputy Chairmen. The committee members shall include one representative each from the China Relief Mission of the Executive Yuan (hereinafter referred to as the "Executive Yuan Mission"), the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Municipal Council, as well as other necessary personnel appointed and hired. The organization thereof shall be formulated by each city and reported to the Executive Yuan for approval.

Article 4: Each city's Allocation Committee shall, based on accurate household registration, print food purchase certificates in units of household or population, and issue them to residents. Residents shall use the certificates to purchase grain at designated grain distribution points. The printing of food purchase certificates shall be based on the principles of being difficult to forge and easy to carry. Food purchase certificates shall not be transferable. The cost of printing the certificates shall be approved and paid by the Executive Yuan Mission from its operating expenses.

Article 5: Residents using certificates to ration rice shall, regardless of age, be allotted one shi dou (15 shi jin) (or the equivalent in flour) per person per month. Residents must purchase the allotted food within the prescribed period, after which it will be considered forfeited. Of the aforementioned rationed food, five sheng (or the equivalent in flour) shall be distributed as American relief grain, and five sheng shall be distributed as government rice. The sources of the government's allotted rice (or wheat flour) shall be the responsibility of the Ministry of Food and the Municipal Government, each being responsible for one-half.

Article 6: The price of rationed rice and flour shall be determined and announced by the Municipal Allocation Committee within a range of 5% lower than the local market price of equivalent quality at the time, adjusted once a month, and reported to the Executive Yuan Mission and the Ministry of Food for record.

Article 7: Designated distribution points shall be given a handling fee (including losses) of 5% of the proceeds from the distribution. After distribution, the proceeds from the daily distribution of grain shall be deposited in a designated bank acting as treasury agent on the following day, into a special grain distribution account, and settled once a month. The municipal government shall be responsible for supervising, assessing, punishing, and recovering funds from designated distribution points that fail to deposit funds as stipulated. The method for handling proceeds from the distribution of American grain shall be separately determined by the Executive Yuan Mission.

Article 8: All accounting matters related to the distribution of grain may be entrusted to reputable accounting firms for processing, in order to ensure transparency, and shall be jointly audited by the Ministry of Food and the Executive Yuan Mission.

Article 9: The Municipal Allocation Committee shall send monthly reports on the physical accounts and deposit accounts of rationed grain to the Ministry of Food and the Executive Yuan Mission for record.

Article 10: American relief grain shall be received and distributed by each city's Allocation Committee from the Executive Yuan Mission's offices in each city.

Article 11: Detailed implementation rules for rationing in each city shall be drafted by the Municipal Government of each city and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.

Article 12: These general rules shall be implemented from the date of approval.

### Outline of the Grain Rationing Plan

(1) Preamble: In accordance with items E and F of Article 2 of the Sino-American Relief Agreement, which state, "The Chinese Government will take appropriate steps to ensure that people of all classes receive fair and equal shares in the distribution of American relief materials and similar materials produced locally or imported from abroad" and "In the major cities of China, where circumstances permit, distribution and price control systems should be established to ensure that people of all classes, regardless of their purchasing power, receive fair shares of relief materials imported from abroad or produced locally," our government has decided to match American relief grain with an equal amount of grain, to implement comprehensive rationing in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. The principles and implementation methods are outlined as follows:

(2) Principles: 1. Comprehensive rationing: All citizens with registered residency shall be entitled to purchase rationed grain with certificates. 2. Fixed quantity: Regardless of gender or age, each person shall be rationed one shi dou (calculated as 15 shi jin) of rice or the equivalent in flour (15 shi jin) per month. 3. Fixed price: Slightly lower than market price, set once a month. 4. Fixed term: Provisionally set for four months (starting in March or April, depending on local grain reserves). 5. Grain source: Half from the United States and half from China. The American portion shall be supplied by the China Relief Mission of the Executive Yuan, and the Chinese portion shall be supplied by the Ministry of Food through centralized planning, with the centralized planning method to be determined separately. A total of 88,000 tons is needed per month, and 352,000 tons are needed for four months (the above quantities include the rice needed for Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and the flour needed for Beiping and Tianjin). (Attached table) Nanjing's population is 1.2 million, requiring 1.2 million dou of rice or 15 jin of flour per person per month, totaling 9,600 tons. A total of 38,400 tons is needed for four months. Shanghai's population is 5 million, requiring 5 million dou, totaling 40,000 tons. A total of 160,000 tons is needed for four months. Guangzhou's population is 1.4 million, requiring 1.4 million dou, totaling 11,200 tons. A total of 44,800 tons is needed for four months. Beiping's population is 1.7 million, requiring 25.5 million jin (equivalent to 1.7 million dou of rice), totaling 13,600 tons. A total of 54,400 tons is needed for four months. Tianjin's population is 1.7 million, requiring 25.5 million jin (equivalent to 1.7 million dou of rice), totaling 13,600 tons. A total of 54,400 tons is needed for four months. In total, the population is 11 million, requiring 11 million dou of rice per month, totaling 88,000 tons, with a total need of 352,000 tons.

(3) Organization: This time, in the five cities' implementation of grain rationing, in addition to American relief grain, our government will also raise an equal amount of grain to implement in coordination. In order to adapt to the administrative system and facilitate implementation, the Ministry of Food shall take overall charge. The mayors of each city shall be practically responsible for the rationing work in each city, and shall either use existing organizations (such as the Food Allocation Committee or distribution points, etc.) or form appropriate organizations, under the supervision of the Ministry of Food, to be responsible for implementation. The American Relief Grain Rationing Committee of the United States Relief Mission of the Executive Yuan (hereinafter referred to as the "Executive Yuan Mission"), originally established in each city, shall be responsible for reviewing and supervising the distribution of the American portion of grain in each city.

### The Fuel Control Committee Purchases Foreign Coal

Requests the Central Bank to Approve an Overdraft of 400 Billion

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] According to the provisions of the five measures for fuel coal supply approved by Chairman Chiang and Premier Zhang, 100,000 tons of foreign coal should be purchased and stored in Shanghai for future use. According to current foreign exchange prices, this requires 400 billion yuan in national currency. The Shanghai Fuel Control Committee is unable to pay, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, considering the matter urgent, has telegraphed Central Bank Governor Zhang, requesting approval for an overdraft of 400 billion yuan, using the ordered foreign coal as collateral for the overdraft, so that it can be purchased and stored in a timely manner. Regarding the current coal needs in the Southeast region, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has taken the following measures: (1) Please instruct Director Li and Commander-in-Chief Fu in Beiping to quickly allocate 100,000 tons of Kailuan coal and transport it to Shanghai, and thereafter maintain a quantity of 150,000 tons per month. (2) 3,400 tons of Kailuan coal and 7,100 tons of Mentougou coal, recently transported to the Tanggu New Port awaiting shipment, have been telegraphed to the Shanghai Fuel Control Committee to dispatch ships for transport. (3) A telegram has been sent to the Taiwan Provincial Government, instructing the Taiwan Anthracite Coal Adjustment Committee to allocate 60,000 tons of coal for transport to Shanghai in February for emergency use. (4) The coal used by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway should be supplied by the Leping Jiangnan Company Coal Mine. The ministry is currently preparing to build a branch line from Guixi to Leping in order to transport coal. The Ministry has notified the mine to quickly negotiate with the Railway Bureau regarding coal supply and export methods.

### Agricultural Loan Zoning Redetermined

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] The issue of the division of agricultural loan areas has changed due to the military impact on the loan areas planned by the Agricultural Bank. On the 23rd, the Special Review Group of the Four Joint Offices decided that it should be reorganized. On the morning of the 24th, the China Farmers Bank specially invited representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food to hold a small group meeting to discuss the division of agricultural loan areas and the technical issues of lending in each area. It was decided to re-divide the areas, and the allocation standard for the amount of lending in each area was determined according to the different prices in each area. The amount of loan per mu in each area was not limited to 100,000 yuan. The discussions on the 24th focused on food and cotton. The division of lending areas between the China Farmers Bank and the Cooperative Treasury will be discussed by both parties at a joint small group meeting on the 26th.

### Senator Taft Declares that U.S. Aid to China is Insufficient

Accuses Marshall of Stubborn Prejudice

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] Senator Taft advocated providing China with strong military assistance to eliminate the Communist rebellion. He also criticized the US government's proposed "Aid to China Plan," saying it was a relief plan that would not solve China's problems. He also criticized the State Department, saying it encouraged the CCP and spread statements against Chairman Chiang. Taft praised Chairman Chiang, saying he was the only person who could prevent the spread of communism in China. However, his troops in the Northeast are currently facing enemies on all four sides and are unable to fight the Communists. The reason is that we have not supplied them with the US weapons and ammunition for months, while the Soviet Union is providing the CCP with as many weapons as possible seized from Japan at the end of the war. Therefore, unless we take strong action immediately, the Northeast of China will fall into the hands of the Communists. Taft also criticized Marshall, saying that he held a completely negative attitude towards his responsibility for the China issue based on his own prejudice.

### The United States' Gold Policy Will Not Change at Present

Talk by an Economic Expert in Shanghai

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The United Press International, New York, recently reported that the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers is advocating a new price for gold. A reporter specially visited an economic expert in this city, who said: At this moment, it is absolutely impossible for the United States to revise its gold policy. Although gold production in the United States has faced rising labor costs after the war, production has continued to increase. The annual estimate for last year is 80 million US dollars, nearly half of the peak of 210 million in 1940 before the war. The amount of gold flowing in after the war is also large, so it does not need to raise the price of gold to stimulate gold production. The United States does not have to worry about exports during the implementation of the Aid to Europe Plan, and it does not need to depreciate the US dollar by raising the price of gold to make commercial competition. Recently, with France opening a gold market, there has been much speculation about the US gold market. In fact, the world has more than one free gold market in France, and the United States is in a different situation and does not need to follow suit.

### The Philippine President Will Order the Return of All Chinese Stalls

[Central News Agency, Manila, 24th] After Ambassador Chen Zhiping of China in the Philippines met with President Roxas at the Presidential Palace of the Philippines for an hour this morning, he told reporters that the Philippine President will immediately issue an order ordering the return of all stalls not currently occupied by Filipinos to Chinese stallholders. Another issue discussed at this meeting was the repatriation to their original residence of Chinese who previously resided in the Philippines. Chen said that he had obtained assurances from President Roxas that all Chinese who hold old Philippine residence permits or other documentary evidence sufficient to prove that they resided in the Philippines before 1941 will be allowed to return to the Philippines.

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 24th] The Communist bandits in Northern Jiangsu are again trying to stir up trouble. On the 22nd, they gathered 100 people and scurried to the Yunhe Line, including Sisui Town in Bao Ying County and Erpu and Pingji in Huaiji County. After the defending troops bravely fought back, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and eventually failed. When they retreated, they set fire to more than 80 civilian houses in Sisui Town to vent their anger.

### The Navy and Army in Cheng Combine to Suppress the Bandits, and the Waters of the Sidunzi River Are Gradually Calming Down

[Our Correspondent in Jiangyin, 24th] Lin Gongwei, the Deputy Captain of the Chutong warship stationed in Chenghai, dispatched two gunboats on the evening of the 23rd to cooperate with the land garrison forces to attack the bandits in Sidunzi.

From the 24th, the river surface has gradually calmed down.

### The National Army on the Outskirts of Baoding Enters Mancheng Territory

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 24th] The Hebei bandits are gathering on the outskirts of Baoding, trying to wait for an opportunity to cause trouble. Officials say that the National Army has now completed its new deployment, and powerful corps have been deployed to strengthen the defense between Xushui and Caohe. The active sweeping campaign on both sides of the Ping-Bao Road has gradually begun.

### The National Army on the Border of Shaanxi and Hubei Recaptured Manchuan Pass Three Times

[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 24th] The National Army in Shanyang, eastern Shaanxi, recaptured Manchuan Pass and Zhaochuan Street on the border of Shaanxi and Hubei for the third time on the 23rd. The remnants of the 2,000 bandits fled in all directions, north and south.

### Chairman Jiang's Handwritten Order to Rush to Repair the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway

[Our Correspondent in Xinpu, 4th] Chairman Chiang ordered the Longhai Railway Bureau to rush to repair the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, requiring it to be opened to traffic within two months.

### Gui Yongqing Talks About the Navy: If the US Government Continues to Aid China Technically, We Can Build a Good Foundation Within Five Years

[United Press, Qingdao, 24th] Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Navy, told United Press reporters yesterday: Unless our country can defend its coast one day, the US Navy will need to stay one day. The United States has contributed greatly to maintaining the safety of the northern section of China's coastline. Qingdao is the headquarters of the US Pacific Fleet and is very important in terms of Far East military strategy, especially today when Dalian and Lushun have not yet returned to our administration. The Chinese government hopes to station its Northern Fleet in Lushun in the future. Gui said that he was pessimistic about the early reception of the two ports. The Sino-Soviet treaty gave the Soviet Union control of Lushun and various rights in Dalian, which was clumsy. Gui also said that he had proposed using the newly recovered Yantai for summer exercises by the US military, but Mr. Badger has not yet replied. The reporter asked: Will the US military still remain in Qingdao when the Chinese Navy training plan is completed? Gui replied: It depends on the situation in the Northeast, Korea, and Japan. Gui hoped that the peace treaty with Japan would limit the Japanese Navy to be smaller than China in the next few years. China does not want to use prohibition methods to take the lead, but must protect itself before the Chinese Navy grows. China currently has five destroyers and less than 300 small warships of various types, which will be enhanced by cruisers and heavy battleships. This depends on the training plan, which is expected to be completed in three to five years. The navy currently has 40,000 officers and soldiers on ships and on shore. Gui acknowledged that China's naval offensive weapons are almost non-existent. Only two of the destroyer fleet have not been dismantled, and even these cannot be prepared for service in six months. If the US government continues to provide technical assistance to China, it is expected that a good foundation can be built within five years.

### Ramsay Arrives in Qingdao, Badger Takes Over Yesterday

Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of our Navy, also participated in the ceremony. Another news: Admiral Ramsay, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, and his party arrived in Qingdao by special plane at 4 p.m. today for inspection.

### The Battle of Xinmin in Western Liaoning Begins; The National Army Cooperates with the Air Force to Encirle and Attack the Communist Gangs; The Claim that the Air Force Stopped Flying to Shenyang is Not True

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 24th] The battle of Xinmin has begun, and the Communist gangs continue to increase. There have been fierce battles in Xinmin and the outposts outside the Juliu River. The National Army is encircling and attacking the Communist gangs by land and air. The Communist gangs outside the port of Yingkou did not dare to attack. The Communist gangs near Kaiyuan Station on the northern road attacked the suburbs of Kaiyuan City, 9 kilometers east of the station, on the 23rd, but failed. Also, according to escapees from Anshan, the steel plant has not been damaged, only slightly damaged by artillery fire. No one of the employees who did not escape the factory has been reported injured or killed. In the battle of Anshan, the Communist gangs suffered more than 20,000 casualties.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 23rd] The battle of Western Liaoning will be launched in Dahu Mountain. Elite National Army troops are passing through Jinzhou to the east one after another, and a certain unit from Shanhaiguan is also passing through the pass one after another to take over the defense. The Jinxi garrison of the Jin-Yu section has made contact with the National Army in Xingcheng, Jinzhou.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] Related information: Benxi is surrounded on all sides, and the situation is tense. Communist bandit plainclothes teams have been found in Benxi Lake. Guanyuan, more than ten miles to the south, Zhongxintai, ten miles to the east, and Hualiansai, 30 miles to the northwest, have been captured.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] The Northeast war situation for a week is as follows: The focus is still on the Southern Liaoning region. The Communist bandits originally planned to besiege Anshan in order to coordinate the harassment in the Shenyang area. The National Army realized their treachery and defended according to the stronghold with a very small number of troops, attracting their main force to a corner of Anshan, cutting it into two sections, and quickly breaking through the bandits in the Shenyang area. Since the 17th, the bandits in various places have been defeated one after another, and the National Army has launched a pursuit. The Communist bandits' self-proclaimed elite Third Column has been fatally hit, and has joined other bandits, fleeing in different directions to the Liao River. In other areas such as northern Liaoning and western Liaoning, there are no bandit activities after the National Army has carried out sweeping operations, which proves that the surrounding situation in Shenyang is becoming more stable.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense verified that the news from the Chennault Airlift Task Force that the Chinese Air Force had stopped flying to Shenyang, which was reported by United Press International Qingdao on the 22nd, is not true. Because in fact, Chinese passenger planes are still running, and the air force has not issued such an order.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] According to US Consul General in Shenyang Walter's telegram to the US Embassy in Nanjing, the Chinese Air Force's suspension of flights to Shenyang was due to frozen runways and personnel relations. The situation around Shenyang has seemed calmer in recent days.

### The Kowloon Walled City Case Nears Final Stage of Negotiations, China Proposes New Suggestions Awaiting British Response

[Our Nanjing Office, 24th] It is learned that the Sino-British negotiations regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident have reached their final stage. Several methods of utilizing the disputed area were successively proposed and discussed by both sides, but no results were obtained. Our country proposed another suggestion last week. After several discussions between Ambassador Steven and the Foreign Minister, we stated that this was our final suggestion and hoped the British side would give it serious consideration. Otherwise, we would revert to our original demands. The British ambassador agreed to forward the suggestion to London for instructions and provide a response as soon as possible. The capital is currently awaiting a response from London. To ensure the smooth progress of the negotiations, what the reporter can report is that the content of the pending suggestion is to utilize the disputed area to construct an uninhabited public space that can be used for recreation and is conducive to health and hygiene, while incorporating symbols of our country's jurisdiction in the design or management. In fact, the British side no longer denies our country's due jurisdictional rights in the negotiations.

### Chennault on US Aid to China: Military Assistance Is Indispensable, Suggests Using Wartime Sino-American Mixed Regiment Model

[Our Dispatch] General Chennault, at the request of reporters yesterday, expressed his views on US military aid to China. Chennault said: "The fact that the US aid to China program does not include a military aid plan has caused disappointment among the Chinese people, and I share that feeling. I do not believe that financial and economic aid alone can save the current serious situation. As for the most effective form of US military aid to China, I believe that when answering this question, there must be a prerequisite, that is, there must first be a sincere understanding between the Chinese and American governments that active military assistance is a necessary measure. I personally believe that this measure is not only necessary, but also indispensable. Before an agreement is reached on this basic principle, it is too early to predict the true content of this measure. However, I personally believe that military aid to China should not only include American advisors and technical assistance, but also some direct guidance that does not conflict with Chinese sovereignty. Such a system of Sino-American cooperation can be exemplified by the Sino-American mixed regiments during the war. However, this type of cooperation should be based on not directly participating in combat." The reporter further asked whether the reports that some American military advisors advocated that the National Army withdraw from the Northeast in order to fully defend North China was a wise strategy. General Chennault replied: "I have not heard that American military advisors advocate withdrawing from the Northeast. However, the situation in that area is rapidly changing and is about to lose the opportunity for free choice. Given China's current military potential, I am very doubtful that North China can maintain a stable situation if the communist troops control the entire Northeast. In terms of international influence, if the Northeast is unfortunately abandoned, I firmly believe that the United States will be greatly shocked and will fully realize that China may lose its position as a barrier to preventing the spread of world communism."

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Yarn Control Committee to Suppress Shanghai Cotton Yarn Price Surge

### Bandits Discovered in the Border Area Between Xiangtan and Hengshan Have Been Defeated

They were defeated in Xiaozhong Township in the county, and a continued cleanup is currently underway. As for Hengshan County, according to a telegram from County Magistrate Liu, Hengshan's winter defense is peaceful and the public order is good. No bandits have been discovered in the county's jurisdiction, so the aforementioned bandits have not infiltrated Hengshan.

Editorial

### Save Our Northeast Compatriots from the Abyss!

General Ma Zhanshan and a group of eight other anti-Japanese heroes from the Songhua River, arrived in Shanghai from their hometowns a few days ago. They first told reporters from the Central News Agency that they were summoned to Beijing to provide opinions to the central government on behalf of the people of the Northeast. The day before yesterday afternoon, they again received the press in Shanghai, detailing the crisis in the Northeast and how to save it: and they had already taken a train to Beijing the night before, to make earnest and sincere appeals to the central government, requesting the central government to quickly decide on a grand plan to save the Northeast. In recent days, the war situation in the Northeast has become more serious day by day. Liaoyang and Anshan have fallen one after another, and Benxi has been fiercely attacked by the communist bandits. Shenyang has indeed fallen into a state of siege. The eyes of the people across the country are focused on the Northeast. The Northeast is the treasure house of East Asia and the lifeline of China. Everyone knows the principle that "only with the Northeast can North China be protected: only by protecting North China can Central China be solidified." Therefore, the people of Beijing and Shanghai are eagerly awaiting the arrival of national heroes and Northeast veterans in Beijing, but at the same time, they are filled with bitterness and regret.

According to General Ma Zhanshan's statement to reporters from the Central News Agency, he will present four suggestions to the central government: (1) Establish local armed forces in the Northeast; (2) Reform the currency system in the Northeast; (3) Transport grain to relieve the food shortage among the people in the Northeast; (4) Simplify administrative institutions. When receiving the press in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he added explanations: (1) Since the victory, the city has suffered severe damage, the people's livelihood has been declining, and the administrative structure is complicated, and the military and civilians are disconnected, which has caused the people of the Northeast to fall into a state of helplessness, so they have to shout loudly and demand that the government give them a thorough reform. (2) The food problem in the Northeast is becoming increasingly serious, especially the food shortage in the city of Shenyang is most worrying. In addition, too many circulation vouchers have been issued, resulting in the value of the currency being less than one-tenth of that of the Taiwan dollar. The central government should take emergency measures to transport grain to relieve the food shortage in the Northeast, and reform the currency system in the Northeast to stabilize the people's livelihood. (3) The current situation in the Northeast has reached its most serious stage. The central government should immediately take effective measures to strengthen the military in the Northeast and at least maintain the existing strongholds. (4) The Northeast problem is not only a national problem, but also a world problem. The people of the whole country should face its seriousness squarely. (5) The way to save the Northeast is to first open up the Yushun transportation line, and at the same time, we must strengthen the military strength in North China. (6) The Northeast has abundant manpower and material resources. If they can be used well, they can become a great force for stabilizing China.

When we listened to General Ma Zhanshan's words, it was as if we heard the faint voices of millions of compatriots in the Northeast. Especially when General Ma said, "The youth of the Northeast have experienced many rebellions and are mostly enthusiastic patriots. Their concept of defending their hometowns is the strongest. If the central government can have appropriate measures, I believe that they will definitely be able to take on the responsibility of defending the country," it moved us the most. However, we must reflect and ask ourselves: Since the victory, what policies have those who have held important military, political, and economic responsibilities in the Northeast grasped? What forces have they used? Have they truly loved the local area? Have they truly been able to cooperate with the people? These great men, initially dazzled by victory, were vying to become the receiving officials of the Northeast. General discussions called for the hearts of the people of the Northeast to be received, but it did not wake them up. Otherwise, we believe that no matter how bad the objective conditions in the Northeast are, the situation in the Northeast would not have deteriorated to such an extent! Of course, the communist bandits, with the support of foreign races, are deliberately trying to seize the Northeast. However, the civil and military officials who have been responsible for the Northeast's military and political affairs should have taken it as a warning to be shamed by failing to fulfill the orders of the supreme commander, and they should have been conscientious and industrious, and they would not have failed the people of the Northeast and the whole country. Now, in this time of crisis, we have to trouble these veterans of the Northeast to go south and appeal, how ashamed should we be, how should we repent?

The communist bandits' ambition to seize the entire Northeast by force was revealed as early as the beginning of the Japanese surrender. On the one hand, the communist bandits prevented the National Army from going to the Northeast to receive sovereignty. On the other hand, they organized the so-called "Democratic Allied Army" to attack the areas that the National Army had already received. The weapons they used were mostly military equipment that the Soviet army had seized when the enemy surrendered, so their strength was quite strong, and it had long been noticed by Chinese and foreign people. In the spring of last year, the communist bandits shouted the slogan "Ensure the Northeast, consolidate North China, and develop Central China," which further showed that the communist bandits' attempt to seize the Northeast was not only their consistent policy of making trouble and rebellion, but also something they were bound to fight for at any cost. For the sake of the future security of the country and the nation, we must resolutely prevent the development of the communist bandits in the Northeast. The starting point should be to trust the people of the Northeast with lofty ideals and to start training local armed forces in the Northeast. Unfortunately, although the whole country, both the government and the public, raised their vigilance at the beginning of the Northeast rebellion, they were unable to decide on appropriate policies to curb the rebellion before the communist bandits grew in power. If the civil and military officials responsible for the Northeast's military, political, and economic affairs could have discerned the environment, known themselves and their enemies, based on the original intention of loving the people and loving the local area, and never had any prejudices or biases, then the compatriots in the Northeast, who had been under the oppressive rule of the Japanese for a long time, would have been able to be inspired and jump for joy. Under the leadership of the central government, they would have done their best to ensure their hometowns. Therefore, the Northeast compatriots' inability to get rid of the abyss early on was half due to the communist bandits and half due to this group of officials who harmed the country!

Although, "what is past cannot be remedied, what is to come can still be pursued." The central government should, in fact, thoroughly reform the political, economic, and military aspects of the Northeast today. "It is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost." The opinions put forward by the Northeast veterans at present are commonplace, but it is important to make decisive decisions and implement them quickly. The 450 million people of the whole country are willing to be the backing for saving the Northeast compatriots. As long as the leadership is appropriate, and as long as the public is united, there is still hope for reversing and consolidating the situation in the Northeast. Here, we would like to offer our views briefly:

First, the unfortunate Northeast has suffered rebellions for nearly ten years. The Northeast compatriots have been separated from the motherland for a long time, and they are not unfamiliar with the political situation in the motherland, but their expectation of throwing themselves into the arms of the motherland contains a strong centripetal force. General Ma and others, with their qualifications as anti-Japanese heroes in the past, will be able to return to the Northeast, climb to a high place and give a call to defend their hometowns. They should be able to gain the resonance of the Northeast compatriots, and it will be easier to accomplish their mission of saving the Northeast. However, General Ma and others have also been separated from the Northeast for nearly ten years, and they may not be able to fully understand the feelings and wishes of the Northeast people today. They should make every effort to communicate their feelings and exchange views, so that they can respond to each other and become one, fill the distance between them, and then they can exert their strength.

Second, in times of crisis in the Northeast, it is most appropriate for Northeast veterans to return to their hometowns. However, at the same time, we earnestly hope that these veterans, on the one hand, will grow stronger with age, and on the other hand, will promote talents, so that the people of the Northeast with lofty ideals, regardless of new or old, young or old, will work together to save the local area and save the people, then they can take on the mission of the current era.

Finally, we believe that the central government will never easily give up the Northeast. Although the situation in the Northeast is serious, there are still ways to think about it and there is still manpower to use. We hope that the officials in the central government will quickly broaden their horizons, expand their minds, concentrate their will, and unite their strength to save the Northeast compatriots from the abyss—

### China's Tung Oil Sales to the US Are Preventing Smuggling

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs: China's tung oil sales to the US are roughly divided into two types: exports from Shanghai and exports from Hong Kong. Due to exchange rate issues, the amount of national currency obtained from the exchange of Shanghai exports based on the selling price is always insufficient to cover the cost by about 5%. On the Hong Kong side, due to the smuggling of tung oil from various ports in South China to Hong Kong, no exchange rate is required, so its selling price is often lower than that in Shanghai. The Chinese government is constantly trying to prevent the smuggling of tung oil to Hong Kong for sale in order to prevent lowering the selling price of tung oil. Some American tung oil producers may not be aware of the smuggling situation and may mistakenly believe that it is dumping. Once this smuggling situation ends, there will naturally be no external sales of low-priced tung oil.

### Shanghai Reporter Group Flies to Taiyuan Today to Investigate the Economy

[Our Dispatch] Since Shanxi was disturbed by the communist bandits, the external transportation of Taiyuan was cut off. Yan Xishan, Chairman of Jin Province, has been holding on to the critical situation for more than two years. Although the prices in Taiyuan are higher than in other places, the economic organization of the province is extremely strict.

Their children shall also be considered as having the nationality of the Republic of China in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the same law. If the Japanese man is unwilling to acquire Chinese nationality, he shall be repatriated to Japan immediately, and his children shall follow the nationality of their mother. Article 2: Japanese women who have become concubines of Taiwanese men, or who have cohabited with Taiwanese men for many years with the intention of permanent cohabitation, and the man's wife has already died, or the Taiwanese man has never married, shall immediately complete the marriage ceremony and then apply for acquiring Chinese nationality in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Nationality Law.

### Last Year, 935 Foreigners Acquired Chinese Nationality

Most of them are Japanese Women

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] After the National Government promulgated the Chinese Nationality Law in the 18th year of the Republic of China, it stipulated that foreigners who are wives of Chinese citizens, or whose fathers are Chinese citizens, or whose fathers are untraceable but whose mothers are Chinese citizens, and those who are adopted sons of Chinese citizens, can acquire the nationality of the Republic of China. Furthermore, foreigners who are over 20 years old, of good character, have resided in China for more than five consecutive years, and possess considerable property or skills sufficient for self-reliance, may also acquire Chinese nationality through naturalization. According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, from the 26th to the 36th year of the Republic of China, a total of 1,257 people acquired our nationality, of which 1,249 were women and only 8 were men. Japanese nationality accounted for 660 people, Russian nationality 227 people, and German nationality 150 people. A total of 417 people acquired nationality through naturalization. The reason for acquiring nationality is that 95% are wives of Chinese citizens, among which Japanese women are the most. Taking the 36th year alone, among the 935 people who acquired our nationality, 647 were of Japanese nationality, and almost all were wives of Chinese citizens.

### Suzhou Rice Prices Surge Again, Disturbances in the Cotton Cloth Market are Severe, and Price Increases in Wuxi are Intensifying

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 24th] Rice prices here suddenly surged again today. Outside the white rice market, transactions were at 2.35 million yuan per dan. Because people are optimistic about further price increases, some rice shops are selling at black market prices as high as 2.7 million yuan, which is causing significant public anxiety. The weather cleared up yesterday and today, and goods from the countryside have been arriving steadily. This price surge is unexpected. It is said that the reasons are: first, the prices of all goods are rising, and rice is following suit; second, it is rumored that the Wuxi County government has abandoned the price restriction system, allowing grain merchants to freely set prices. Rice merchants here have long felt aggrieved by the government's price restrictions and are also brewing demands for the county government to abolish the price restrictions. This has caused the restricted price to become detached from the actual market price. All sectors of society are deeply concerned that with rice prices soaring so high, various problems will follow.

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 24th] Today, the price increases here are intensifying. Due to purchases from the northern region, rice prices have risen by more than 100,000 yuan. White glutinous rice is at 2,554,000, white round rice at 2,484,000, glutinous paddy at 1,120,000, round paddy at 1,165,000, Xiangshan glutinous paddy at 1,032,000, and port paddy at 1,022,000, each rising by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Wheat is at 3,350,000 to 3,380,000, jumping by more than 200,000 yuan. Flour is at 1,240,000, rising by 40,000 yuan. Soybean oil is at 5,700,000, continuing to rise by more than 200,000 yuan. Double Fish yarn is at 64,400,000, soaring by more than 4,000,000 yuan.

[Our Nantong Dispatch, 24th] Yarn prices continue to rise after rice prices. Today, the market price in this city reached 62.5 million yuan, and most yarn merchants are still unwilling to sell. The unofficial rice price has reached 2.67 million yuan. Five Oceans (a brand of edible oil) continues to rise, with oil at 9.6 million yuan per barrel. Cigarettes are stable. Soap is also rising, with Sunlight soap at 3.2 million yuan per case. Flour prices are rising alarmingly, at 990,000 yuan per bag, which is 50% higher than at the end of last year.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 24th] Prices in Zhenjiang are chaotic, changing from morning to evening. The County Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting today and unanimously believed that slight adjustments would help the price increases. It has now been decided that all proposals will be reserved, and after the Provincial Government Economic Council decides on the pricing principles, the meeting will reconvene on Friday of this week.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] Prices in Jinan City are generally soaring. Among them, the most volatile are cotton yarns and cloths. On the 23rd, prices rose by nearly 2,000 yuan in a single day. The highest price for 20-count local spider yarn reached 77 million yuan per piece, which is even higher than the price in Qingdao and Shanghai. Although prices stabilized somewhat on the 24th, observers generally believe that some people are manipulating the market and hoarding goods for speculation. In addition, the black market price of gold suddenly rose to nearly 20 million yuan on the 23rd, but fell to 18.5 million yuan per tael on the 24th.

### Beiping Cracks Communist Bandit Organization, 103 People Arrested, Joint Declaration of Self-Renewal, Security Authorities Release Details of the Case

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] The Beiping Committee of the Communist Bandit City Work Department was cracked by the local security organs at the end of the 36th year. The bandit municipal committee Bao Ke and 103 others were arrested. After being persuaded with righteousness, they all knew to repent, were willing to break away from the Communist bandits, participate in the National Revolution, and engage in the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. They jointly issued a declaration a few days ago, stating their aspiration to abandon banditry and start anew. The security authorities released the details of the case, stating:

Grasping the Treacherous Plans

The Communist bandits launched a rebellion, destroying cities and towns, and disrupting the lives of our rear area people. They had long been plotting this. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they organized the "City Work Department" and dispatched a large number of workers to sneak into major cities to carry out activities. After the victory, their activities became even greater. Beiping is the military and political center of North China, and their deliberate sabotage was particularly unreserved. The city's security organs understood the Communist bandits' treacherous plans and mobilized capable cadres to spread a reconnaissance network. They had long learned that the person directing underground activities in this city was the City Work Department led by Liu Ren of the Communist Bandit Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau. There were no clues at first, but there was some understanding over the years. In order to completely destroy its organization, they did not immediately crack the case, but after more than a year of close surveillance, tracking, and investigation, they learned about the organizational system of its City Work Department. Its main work departments were the Industrial Committee, the Railway Committee, the Beiping Committee, and the Student Committee. The Beiping Committee and the Student Committee were its backbone. They also learned that the main person in charge of the Beiping Committee in this city was Bao Ke of the Municipal Committee, who used a certain inn outside Zhengyangmen as the main base and met with district committee members Zhang Yingmin and others from time to time.

Starting the Action

After multiple days of waiting and investigation, and confirming that there were no errors, they began to take action at the end of last year. They arrested district committee member Zhang Yingmin and cadres Wang Chengwang, Qi Tianqing, Zhang Yuehua (female), Wu Xiaobo, and others on the spot. However, Bao Ke's whereabouts were secretive, and his address was uncertain. After Zhang and others were arrested, they investigated for another three days, and the bandit Bao finally fell into the net. Subsequently, according to the clues provided by Bao and others, they continued to arrest bandit district committee members Yang Ying, Liu Zhenzhong, Wang Hongru, Zhang Haiquan, branch secretaries Ma Hongjie, Guo Chunlin, traffic officers Liu Guirong, Gao Xiaocai, liaison officers Zhang Yansheng, Shan Xiuwen, Ma Baolin, Zhang Jianheng, informant Li Zhenzhou, and party members Han Jiuru and others, totaling 103 people.

Confiscated Documents

They cracked 37 branches and 68 groups, and confiscated 30 copies of Communist bandit propaganda documents, a secret statistical material of the Beiping Underground Work of the City Work Department, a note from district committee member Yang Ying recalling them to the organ, a report from Bao Ke and Zhao Fan to Liu Ren, head of the City Work Department, a notice from Liu Ren, head of the City Work Department, recalling district committee member Yang Ying, and various secret codes of the Communist bandits and several secret reports.

Conspiracy Activities

It was found that Bao Ke (alias Liu Jianye, Chen Changqing, Gong Wengyao) was led by Liu Ren, head of the Communist Bandit City Work Department, and was connected by Li Xingji. He directed the district committees in this city to carry out the following conspiracy activities: (1) Absorb party members and develop the organization. (2) Engage in anti-government and anti-allied propaganda. (3) Detect government and national army intelligence. (4) Incite strikes, class boycotts, teaching boycotts, grain grabbing, and stir up worker and student movements to disrupt social order. (5) Prepare secret armed forces so that when the Communist bandits invade this city, they can rise up as internal collaborators. (6) Disrupt the government's political, financial, economic, cultural, and military measures. (7) Incite kind workers and farmers, organize young students, lower and middle-level civil servants, and frustrated elements to go to the Communist bandit area to receive red training. (8) Sabotage tap water, electric lights, transportation agencies, and factory production sites. (9) Carry out red propaganda, spread rumors, and confuse people's minds.

### US Representative Urges Small Assembly to Handle National Elections in Korea, Election Monitoring Committee Need Not Consider Soviet Obstruction, Korean Representative to China Urges UN to Establish South Korean Government Quickly

[United Press, Success Lake, 24th] The United Nations Small Assembly began debating the issue of Korean independence today. US Representative Jessup urged the Assembly to ignore Soviet obstruction and proceed with holding national elections in Korea. It is said that it is the duty of the United Nations Korean Election Monitoring Committee to work quickly so that the Korean people can elect a parliament. The United Nations organization must not allow the Soviet Union's policy of non-cooperation to obstruct the construction of a free and independent Korea. It is hoped that the Soviet Union will change its mind and allow the committee to hold elections in the Soviet-occupied areas in accordance with the instructions of the Small Assembly.

[Associated Press, Success Lake, 24th] On the 24th, the United States requested that the United Nations Small Assembly order some local elections to be held in South Korea. The elections, under the supervision of the United Nations, will elect two-thirds of the representatives of the "Korean National Assembly," which is a step towards an independent national government. US Representative Jessup said that the population of North Korea accounts for about one-third of the country's total population, so one-third of the seats in the National Assembly should be left vacant. He reiterated the United States' desire to enable the Korean people to quickly obtain self-governance and independence. He said: "Due to the lack of manpower of the committee, it is not possible to hold elections in all areas at the same time, so it may be possible to hold elections from south to north, area by area. We hope that this kind of election can be extended to the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea, otherwise two-thirds of the representatives of the National Assembly can be elected, and the remaining one-third of the people will be deprived of the right to elect representatives to participate in the National Assembly. The world should know who deprives them of this right, but the Korean National Assembly can be established. If it is willing, it can discuss the establishment of a national government with the Korean Committee. We hope that the people of North Korea can participate in the national government at this time." Jessup said when submitting the Gen. Country's plan to the Small Assembly: "At present, Gen. People are still unwilling to speculate that the Soviet Union will support the wishes of the United Nations and the hopes of the Korean people. Why can't one-third of the Korean people participate in the election? If there should be an election, why doesn't the Korean Committee implement it?"

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Korean Mission to China, the China General Branch of the Korean Independence Party, and Korean residents' associations in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Bian, Xu, Sui, Taiwan, and other places, sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 23rd, petitioning the UN: "We hope that the decision will be made before March 1st to announce the holding of general elections in South Korea, establish an independent government, and hope that in order to realize free elections, the police rule in South Korea will be terminated as soon as possible." Min Seok-rin, a spokesman for the Korean Mission to China, also said: The on-site observation of the United Nations Korean Committee will definitely help them make a wise decision on this matter.

### Three Powers Agree on the German Question, Eastern Repatriation, Benelux Countries to Participate, First Discuss Germany's Position in the European Aid Plan

[Associated Press, London, 23rd] The United States, Britain, and France formally held a secret meeting on Germany today and agreed to give priority to discussing Germany's position in the Marshall Plan. At the start of the talks, the British Foreign Office published its note rejecting the Soviet Union's protest against the meeting. The note stated that Britain had decided to reopen negotiations on all points on which the four powers disagreed, in order to avoid "peaceful reconstruction of Germany and Europe being hampered." The three powers also invited the Benelux countries to participate in discussions on issues related to those three countries. The three powers have agreed that economic issues will be the top priority of the agenda. At the same time, the three powers' experts on the German question will determine the final figures for Germany's share in the Marshall Plan. All parties participating in the meeting expect that this statistic will occupy a military position in the Six-Nation Conference to be convened at the end of March. Clear signs indicate that the three powers and the Benelux countries will use this meeting to discuss the division of Germany into East and West and exchange views on how to draft another policy for the future, such as Germany being divided into a permanent division.

### Six Items on the Agenda

The other items to be discussed at the meeting are as follows: (1) The role of West Germany in the Marshall Plan. (2) Control of the Rhineland. (3) Security measures to prevent possible German aggression. (4) Reparations. (5) German political and civil groups. The merger of the three zones of West Germany into an economic system will be based on this. (6) Temporary territorial agreement. This issue will include the territorial demands of Germany's western neighbors on Germany. One US diplomat said, "If we cannot reach an agreement on detailed methods, we hope to reach an agreement in principle. We would like this discussion to be of an informal nature, so it is the first opportunity for several countries to frankly express their opinions and exchange views."

[Reuters, London, 23rd] At the beginning of the meeting of the three powers of Britain, the United States, and France, the three countries of Czechoslovakia and Poland had submitted protests to the three powers meeting. According to a Paris telegram, diplomatic circles there expect that if the London meeting can produce a firm and consistent policy, Molotov may change his current policy towards Germany. Recently, the Soviet Union's policy in Germany has been quite hesitant, and the Soviet Union seems to have the intention of keeping the foreign ministers' conference mechanism active. The motive is that the Soviet Union still intends to retain the right to speak on the development of West Germany. Diplomatic reports from the Allied Control Authority in Berlin show that the firmness and achievements of the Western three powers are the key to restoring the Soviet Union's participation in four-power cooperation. General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of the US Army, and his political advisor Flying, both have this opinion.

### Italy Joins United Nations Organization

[French News Agency, Paris, 21st] Italy has formally joined the United Nations as the 41st member state.

### Five Western European Countries Discuss Establishing Alliance

Foreign Ministers Meeting to be Held Soon

[Reuters, London, 23rd] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain and France have agreed in principle that the foreign ministers of the two countries will meet with the foreign ministers of the Benelux countries in the near future to discuss the proposal for Western European unity. However, the British Foreign Office spokesman said that London believes that this five-nation foreign ministers meeting must be carefully prepared, and so far there has been no definite deployment of the meeting. The date of the meeting does not necessarily have to be decided after the British, American, and French three-power German question meeting is concluded, because the two meetings have no necessary connection. According to well-informed sources, the meeting of the five foreign ministers may be held in Belgium. The form of the alliance treaty proposed by the British and French in the memorandum to the Benelux countries is still under study. The Benelux countries are also still studying the draft alliance treaty proposed by Britain and France, and neither side has yet put forward a final opinion.

[Reuters, Success Lake, 24th] US Representative to the Security Council Austin revealed today that the United States will issue its final attitude on the partition of Palestine in the Security Council today. Austin has just received instructions from Secretary of State Marshall yesterday. The Security Council is waiting for the United States to provide a final answer to the following three questions today: (1) Will the United States revoke its arms embargo on the Middle East; (2) Is the United States willing to participate in the international military force with US troops; (3) Is the United States willing to ask the United Nations to declare the Arab countries aggressors against the UN General Assembly partition resolution.

### Berlin and Paris Widely Report US-Soviet Secret Talks, Saying a Stalin-Truman Meeting is Impossible

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Despite denials from both the US and the Soviet Union, it is still widely rumored here that Murphy, the political advisor to US military commander Clay, and a senior political figure from the Soviet military government held an informal secret meeting in a neutral location earlier this month. One account claims the Soviet representative was Colonel Siminov, the chief advisor to Soviet military commander Sokolovsky.  According to the London correspondent of the Paris newspaper "Le Figaro" today, the Soviet representative was General Marinin, Sokolovsky's political advisor.  However, General Marinin often uses the name Georgiev when contacting German political circles. According to a report in "Le Figaro," Marinin suggested to Murphy during the meeting why not have Stalin and Truman meet. He said that Truman would not want to go to Moscow, and Stalin would not want to go to Washington, so why not meet in Stockholm? After a moment of thought, Murphy said that due to repeated attacks on the US President by the Soviet press, this was almost impossible. Marinin reportedly said that once Wallace was elected president, the Soviet press would no longer attack. Murphy reportedly said Wallace would not be elected president. Marinin replied that perhaps not this year, but definitely in four years.  The editor of "Le Figaro" added a note after the report, saying that although the report might seem strange, the newspaper was not afraid of denial.

### Europe May Remain Neutral if the US is Attacked

Hoover Discusses Future Wars

[United Press, New York, 23rd] Former US President Hoover declared tonight at a Washington's Birthday commemorative banquet that if the United States were attacked, Britain and Western Europe might remain neutral. This is not to accuse them of bad faith or ingratitude for the countless resources and blood that the US expended in liberating Europe, but rather due to the weakness of European nations in the face of the clear fact of the two and a half million Red Army soldiers along the Iron Curtain. We should understand that if someone declares war on the US, we will have no reliable military allies in the world. However, he firmly believed that a Western European federation could enhance peace and defense.

[United Press, Iwao, 24th] Authorities at the Far East Food Conference today denied a report in a Manila newspaper that the Soviet Union, Japan, and Korea would be excluded from the International Fisheries Council. Dr. Fee, the Canadian fisheries advisor to the conference, said: "The above report is inaccurate. The issue of which countries should be members of the proposed Fisheries Council has never been discussed at the conference. The Soviet Union is currently participating in the Far East Food Conference and therefore cannot become a member. However, the Soviet Union is free to participate in the Far East Food Conference at any time. Japan and Korea will receive the same treatment if they are recognized as independent nations." He also said that the report stating that the Fisheries Council has eleven member states is also inaccurate, and the number of member states has not been decided at the conference.

[United Press, Baguio, 24th] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization conference entered its second day today.

### Taft Supports Principles of European Recovery Aid

[Reuters, Detroit, 23rd] Senator Taft, a possible Republican presidential candidate, gave a speech here criticizing the concessions made to the Soviet Union during the war and the US failure to obtain guarantees from the Soviet Union in exchange for Lend-Lease aid. He said, "We have completely torn up the Atlantic Charter and abandoned all the principles for which the war was fought. We have never mentioned the freedom of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, nor have we effectively defended Poland's freedom." Taft outlined the policies he would implement if elected president. He said that most of the current difficulties were caused by the Roosevelt administration. The policy of unconditional surrender destroyed Germany, creating a vacuum in Europe, and allowing the Soviet Union to take advantage of it. As for Truman's foreign policy, fortunately, Republican Senator Vandenberg's influence at various international conferences finally forced the Truman administration to abandon its appeasement policy towards Russia. Taft expressed support for the principles of the Marshall Plan, but believed that the complete recovery of European countries depended 90% on their own efforts.

Wallace has personally asked him to participate in the vice-presidential race. Taylor said he would join Wallace in a brave and glorious struggle for peace. Taylor, 44, is a former stage actor. When he brought his family of five to Washington, he could not find a house, so he climbed the marble steps of the Capitol, strummed a guitar, and sang in the tones of a Western cowboy, "Give me a house beside the Capitol." Therefore, people often call him the Singing Cowboy. When a special session of Congress was convened last November to discuss foreign aid, Taylor rode a horse from California to the East, criticizing the government's foreign policy everywhere.

### Hull's Memoirs (13)

— Copyrighted by North American Newspaper Alliance, Translated by the Newspaper Translation Office

First Time Flying at the Age of 72

Around the time of the Quebec Conference (August 1943), a Soviet newspaper suddenly put forward the idea that although a meeting of the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union was impossible because Stalin was focused on directing the large-scale war against Germany in the East, a meeting of foreign ministers could be held and could be effective.

The President and Churchill immediately began to study this proposal, and asked Stalin whether he also thought it appropriate to hold a meeting of foreign ministers in the near future. Stalin replied to them both on August 24, saying that he approved. He also said that the meeting should not be of a narrow, exploratory nature, but should be practical preparation, so that the three governments could reach definite decisions. He suggested that the scope of the issues to be discussed should be decided in advance.

After exchanging views, the President and Churchill sent another telegram to Stalin on September 6, in which he said that Churchill and he were deeply pleased with the idea of ​​holding a political and military conference at the level of foreign ministers. Although the Prime Minister suggested London or other cities in Britain as the venue for the meeting, the President said that he thought a more remote place would be better. He suggested Casablanca, Tunisia, or even Sicily. He said that he hoped to send me to the meeting, but he did not want me to travel so far, so he would send Under Secretary of State Welles. Two days later, Stalin suggested Moscow as the venue for the meeting, with the date being early October, and the President agreed on September 11.

At that time, Welles was still in Burma, and according to reliable information I received, he was writing many letters to friends in Washington, saying that he had become a victim of mistreatment.

After a considerable number of this type of fact had accumulated, I went to see the President. I reminded him that he and I had agreed to send Welles to Moscow as the best way to get him out of the State Department without arousing public sentiment. Welles did not think it appropriate to participate in our plan, and went to Burma, and was writing letters to many people there, apparently trying to portray himself as a martyr. I also mentioned to the President what Welles had said when I proposed to send him to Moscow, that such a trip would not be fruitful. I said that I now opposed the State Department recognizing his position, unless he retracted the severe criticism for which he should be responsible, and declared his loyalty to the State Department and the government. Welles did none of these things, and continued to make general criticisms of me and the State Department in a remote place. When one or two newspapers closely related to Welles continued this propaganda, claiming that I was an enemy of the Soviet Union and hoped it would bleed to death, I went to the President and said that I strongly opposed Welles going to Moscow.

I told the President that no matter where the meeting was held—anywhere between here and Chongqing—I would go there myself.

The President immediately expressed satisfaction with my willingness to go myself, and said it forcefully two or three times. At the same time, he was also quite surprised. He knew that I was not in good health, that I was no longer young—I was approaching the eve of my seventy-second birthday—and that I had never been in an airplane.

He did not know another fact—that I suffered somewhat from a disease, which was a fear of being in small, stuffy places. Several years ago, on a very hot night, when I was riding in a sleeping car with the window open through a long tunnel, I woke up and found myself apparently suffocating from carbon gas or other gases. Since then, I have been afraid of narrow, confined places. I had this feeling about airplanes, so I had never taken one before.

But I have now decided to fly to the diplomatic appointment in Moscow, just as an officer must take his troops into battle, whether he wants to or not. I made this decision myself without consulting my doctor or Mrs. Hull. Before I set off for Moscow, I held meetings with the President on October 4 and 5, and had lunch with him on the 6th, to review the various plans that would generally be raised in Moscow. On the 5th, I took Stettinius, Hackworth, Dunn, Matthews, and Bohlen to the White House for a clear discussion with the President, at which Admiral Leahy also attended.

We agreed that in this meeting we should make every effort to obtain British and Soviet agreement to China's participation in a Four-Power Declaration (this is a declaration on various post-war agreements, including the establishment of an international peace organization. The Soviet Union had opposed including China—Editor, News Service). We believed that the concept of the Four Powers should be maintained, even if it meant that an agreement could not be reached at that time. Whether now or in the future, because of its influence on itself and on British India, China is too important a factor to be alienated.

As for Germany, the President said that he thoroughly agreed to divide the country into three or more states, each with its own autonomy, but connected by a postal, transportation, railway, customs, or electricity network, although he believed that the layout of the electricity system should be based on the continent. He also said that the new German states should be deprived of all military activities, including training and arms industries. East Prussia should be separated from Germany, and all dangerous elements among the population should be forcibly evicted.

Others among us argued that partition would produce many adverse effects, and that the customs union approach might either prove unworkable or become a powerful tool for restoring German unity. The President took this into consideration. He said that we had a tendency to exaggerate these effects. He said that he had traveled in Germany, could speak German, and thought he knew Germany better. He insisted that partition was the solution. The conversation moved on to other topics, but after a considerable time, the President suddenly returned to the German issue, saying that his knowledge of Germany was many years ago, and perhaps he did not know Germany as much as he thought he did. So he said that the entire transitional period would be a period of trial and error. We might find that the partition measures implemented immediately after the war would eventually be abandoned. He believed that reparations should be extracted from manpower and equipment.

Mr. Roosevelt said that the recovery of the Netherlands or the Scandinavian countries would not be a problem, but Belgium might cause difficulties. He said that King Leopold was a German prisoner, with an ambiguous position. Britain was supporting him because Churchill believed that the royal family could be restored, but he might cause difficulties for the Belgian government in exile. Apart from this, Belgium was an artificial country formed by the merger of two states, and the Walloons and Flemings had traditionally been at odds. On this point, the President referred to a study made by a German in 1940, which suggested that a federation should be organized from Alsace, Lorraine, Luxembourg, and the two parts of Belgium. As for Poland and the Baltic countries, the President said that when he met Stalin, he wanted to appeal to him with noble moral force. He would say to him that Britain and we would not attack the Soviet Union in the Baltic, but for the Soviet Union's own interests, given its position in the world, it would be good for it to say that it would be willing to hold a second plebiscite in the Baltic countries about two years after the war. He believed that although the Soviet Union thought that the plebiscite it held there was conclusive and satisfactory, the rest of the world did not seem to think so. He believed that the same idea could be applied to eastern Poland, but that country's new borders should be slightly east of the so-called Curzon Line in the future, giving Lviv to Poland, and a plebiscite should be held after the shocks of the war had subsided.

Mr. Roosevelt felt that the Baltic Corridor—Kiel and the Straits—could have a free zone established, under international management, and a similar zone could be established for the Soviet Union in the Persian Gulf.

At noon on October 7, on a sunny day, I went to Washington Airport to take a plane to Moscow—this was the first time I had ever stepped on a plane.

This was a four-engine transport plane, followed by two similar planes, most of which were Army and Navy personnel.

After I got on the plane, Commander Meyer showed me several emergency exits, ready to be used when the plane "touched" the water. He was sent by the Navy to manage the oxygen on the plane. I said that the fact that there were several exits on the plane reminded me of the story of an old man in Tennessee who kept three cats. One day, a friend went to visit him and found three semicircular holes under the front door.

He asked, "What are these for—?"

The reply was "To let my cats out."

"But why isn't one enough for them?"

The old man retorted forcefully,

"Because when I say 'Out together,' I really want them to go 'Out together'!"

Our first step was to Goose Bay. Over Georgia, the plane had to fly to an altitude of 10,000 feet, and at 8,000 feet I was fitted with an oxygen mask and hood. Old people's reaction to high-altitude flight is not good, and it can easily cause a heart attack, but I did not feel uncomfortable.

The next morning, our second step took us to San Juan, Puerto Rico. We took the cruiser "Peacock" across the Atlantic to North Africa.

We landed in Casablanca. Our foreign service official flew to meet me. He was in charge of political affairs in North Africa. I was immediately taken to the airport. The plane had flown across the Atlantic at the same time, so we got back on the plane.

Murphy accompanied us on this flight to Algiers, and gave me a general account of his general impression of the situation in North Africa and Italy. In Algiers, I had dinner with Eisenhower. He had come specially from Italy, and I was deeply impressed by his personality and confidence. De Gaulle also came to visit me. We had a long and fairly frank conversation, without reaching any decisions. De Gaulle was more friendly than I had imagined, but his great political ambition seemed to me to be on the verge of bursting out. We flew from Algiers to Cairo at night. I slept quite well. The next morning, I set off for Tehran, Iran.

British Foreign Secretary Eden telegraphed me, suggesting that he and I should hold a preliminary meeting in Cairo before going to Moscow. I replied that our Soviet friends were generally quite suspicious, and would think that Britain and the United States were forming a common policy before starting discussions with the Soviet Union. But when I arrived in Tehran, Eden arrived at about the same time, according to his own timetable. We exchanged greetings and had a few casual words, without entering into any real discussion.

In Tehran, two Soviet pilots boarded the plane. Our new ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, also joined us and stayed with us all the way.

We arrived in Moscow on a cold afternoon on October 18, as the sun was setting. Molotov and Litvinov, as well as our wartime production chief Nelson and a large number of other officials, welcomed us at the airport. Molotov and Litvinov greeted me warmly. I was then driven to the American Embassy.

### Ashida Hitoshi Visits MacArthur Headquarters, Believes Ashida's Election Method is Democratic, New Cabinet's Policy Outline Consultation Work Begins

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Incoming new Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida visited General MacArthur's headquarters at 11:30 AM on the 24th to inform MacArthur that he had been elected as the fifth Prime Minister of post-war Japan. It is believed that Ashida explained his "middle-of-the-road" government plan and requested the Allied authorities to continue assisting with the import of necessary food, capital, and raw materials for economic recovery.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th] A spokesperson for MacArthur's headquarters, Mr. Spurr, today refuted the insulting propaganda in Tokyo newspapers regarding the new government, praising the election method of the new Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida as completely democratic and in compliance with the special provisions of the current constitution. This statement was issued in response to the media's belief that the constitution's provision that the position of Prime Minister should automatically be transferred to the leader of the opposition party upon resignation has given Hitoshi Ashida an indirect support in the eyes of the Japanese people.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The work of forming the new Ashida cabinet officially began on the 24th. The new Prime Minister Ashida first met with Democratic Party leaders such as Tomabechi and Kurisu in the morning to discuss policy agreements. In the afternoon, he met with Katayama, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, at the Prime Minister's official residence to discuss the policy outline. Subsequently, he visited Miki, Chairman of the National Cooperative Party, and also discussed the policy outline. Afterward, the new Prime Minister Ashida told reporters: "It has been decided that three members from each party, including the Socialist, National Cooperative, and Democratic parties, will first discuss the policy outline. If a policy agreement cannot be reached, then because the Democratic Party cannot form a cabinet alone, other methods will be considered." In addition, Ashida will visit Liberal Party President Yoshida on the 25th to ask for his cooperation and assistance.

### Second Day of the Municipal Assembly, Mayor Wu Answers Inquiries: Elections Are Conducted According to Law, No Evidence of Corruption Found, Rising Prices Make It Difficult for Local Governments to Bear Full Responsibility

[Reported by This Newspaper] The fifth session of the Municipal Assembly continued its second meeting yesterday afternoon. First, the councilors raised general questions to Mayor Wu, who answered them one by one, lasting a total of one hour. Then, the directors of the Finance, Education, and Land Administration Bureaus respectively reported on the general situation of their work. After the reports, the councilors raised questions to the Finance Bureau, which Director Tian answered. There were also questions to the Land Administration Bureau, with the most opinions expressed on the issue of rental standards. Director Zhu also answered accordingly. The questioning of the Education Bureau and the director's answers were postponed to this afternoon due to lack of time.

The meeting was originally scheduled to begin at 2:00 PM, but at 2:20 PM, the quorum was still not met. The speaker announced that a forum would be held first. The official meeting began at 2:50 PM. The councilors first raised general questions to the mayor, including: Shao Yongsheng asked, (1) The paper stored in the paper shop is for business needs and has not been investigated. The government took it to the police station, which is a violation of the people's private property. Although it was returned later, who should be responsible for any losses during transportation? (2) A certain owner of a cigarette paper shop used years of savings to purchase silver and did not use it for profit. Why was it confiscated? Mayor Wu replied: The economic problem is the most difficult to deal with at present, but this is part of the central government's overall plan, and the local government has a smaller responsibility and no power itself. In the face of rising inflation, emergency measures must be taken. He feels ashamed that he failed to consider everything when implementing them. Regarding the case of the paper stored in the paper shop, the authorities did not take the paper away, but only checked the accounts. If it was found to be hoarding for speculation, it would be sent to the court. After investigation, it was found that there was no violation of the law, and the punishment was immediately revoked. The case of storing silver was investigated according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, and the power rests with the Ministry of Finance.

### The Rampant "Hen Mouse Brand" Is Not Ignored

Zhang Zhongyuan asked whether the "Hen Mouse Brand" in the stock exchange is a legal organization and why the municipal government does not stop it. The mayor said that the Hen Mouse Brand is the so-called over-the-counter transaction. The authorities have tried their best to eliminate it, but have not been able to do so thoroughly, and it is not being ignored. Jiang Hao asked: (1) Very unpleasant things happened in the city's election, especially in the election of legislators. The turnout was not enthusiastic, but why were there so many votes in the end? Mayor Wu should be responsible as the chairman of the election office. What is the inside story? Did he order his subordinates to do things outside the law, or did he report any corruption? (2) What overall measures does the city government have to prevent rising prices in advance? (3) What has been done so far in terms of austerity? Can a statistical report be given? The mayor replied: (1) The election was conducted in accordance with the election law. The districts distributed ballots to citizens. He also attached great importance to this and sent four city government advisors to monitor it. However, manpower was limited, and the monitors did not see any corruption when they were on the scene. This kind of phenomenon may have occurred when they were not on the scene, but he personally never ordered his subordinates to violate the law. According to the central government's interpretation, it is legal to issue as many votes as were issued, as long as the number of votes returned does not exceed the original number. (2) The central government has its own decision-making power regarding the overall measures to prevent rising prices, and the local government cannot be fully responsible. (3) In terms of austerity, the prices of wine and dishes have been reduced as much as possible, and they have not been set according to the prices set by the wine and dish industry. As for the ban on dancing, he has no explanation and it is an order from the central government.

### No Power to Decide Rice Prices

Yan Guodong said that the price of rationed rice must be limited. If it rises with the market price, it will have a negative impact. It should be adjusted once every three months or half a year. The mayor said that this is a central government regulation and the city has no power to set prices. Zhao Yangxiong proposed: (1) The city government should severely punish the murderer who insulted the mayor. Before any incident occurs in the future, the directly responsible person should have the leeway to handle it. Only when it cannot be resolved should the mayor make the final decision. (2) When will the committee for special relief donations be established in Shanghai? Can it be established immediately? What enforcement measures does the mayor have? The mayor first expressed his gratitude to the councilors for their concern, and then said that for the civil part of the case against the murderer, he did not want to prosecute because the injuries were not serious. The criminal part is handled by the court. He also replied: The committee for special relief donations will hold its first meeting this Friday. Huang Zhenshen asked whether raising interest rates on deposits at the Central Bank could fuel inflation and whether it could be negotiated with the central government. He replied that this is beyond the responsibility of the city government. Yang Gongshu expressed his hope that the rental standards should be adjusted reasonably. Wang Weixin said that according to the statistics of the 107 resolutions of the fourth assembly, the bureaus have completed or are in the process of completing 43 percent, and 57 percent have not been completed. He asked why? The mayor replied that the city government is doing its best to implement them. Those that have not been completed are due to actual difficulties, and the reasons have been submitted to the assembly for explanation.

### Education Bureau Director Reports That More Primary and Secondary Schools Will Be Added

Director of the Education Bureau Li Ximou's work report mainly included the following points: (1) National education: There are currently 900 private primary schools and 269 municipal primary schools, with a total of 357,800 students, accounting for more than 80 percent of the city's school-age children. The Education Bureau is investigating the reasons for the approximately 100,000 children who are not enrolled. One part of this is because parents cannot afford the financial burden, and another part is child labor, and parents do not allow them to go to school. It is planned to increase the number of national primary school classes by 200 to 300 this autumn. The two national schools that have been prepared for opening recently are located on Macau Road and next to Jiaozhou Park. It is true that no school has been established in the Zhabei district, because no public land can be found or private land is sold but not suitable for building schools. Now the district office of the district plans to donate a school, so there will be at least one school in the near future. (2) Secondary education: The three schools to be built this year are Wusong Middle School, Yangjing Middle School, and Xinlu Normal School. The two middle schools in Yangshupu and Xinjing are being prepared. In the future, the establishment of middle schools will focus on vocational education. (3) Social education: There are a total of 189 community schools and 113 supplementary schools, with a total of more than 37,000 students. Future plans include promoting them in factories and shops. The promotion of national physical education will include the establishment of simple sports fields in parks. In addition, it is planned to build an art museum, a library, and a museum. (4) General education: Director Li solemnly declared that the municipal schools are absolutely not allowed to collect compulsory tuition fees. As for construction fees, it is hoped that one new school building can be built per semester after collection. This time, in order to handle the unified scholarship, it is planned to provide all 3,000 places for students in suburban areas to apply. Illegal educational groups will be cracked down on.

In addition, in order to establish contact between parents and schools, the Education Bureau specially promotes the holding of parent-teacher associations in each school. The school environment should also be improved as much as possible to make students interested in the school.

Due to lack of time yesterday, the questions to the Education Bureau and the director's answers will be continued this afternoon.

### Today's Agenda

Today's agenda is: From 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, councilors will question the Education Bureau, and the director will answer. The directors of the Health, Public Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus will report on their work. Councilors will ask questions, and the directors of each bureau will answer.

### Appropriate Handling of Labor Strikes and Student Protests: Assembly Resolves to Commend Four Chiefs

[Reported by This Newspaper] Before the adjournment of yesterday's assembly, Speaker Pan proposed a temporary motion, jointly signed by more than ten councilors, including Vice-Speaker Xu, Du Yuesheng, Jin Runxiang, Xi Wangshu, Gao Shuan, and Chen Baotai. The motion was: "Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Director Yu, and Director Wu have taken appropriate measures in handling labor strikes and student protests, and it is proposed that the assembly commend them." The assembly unanimously approved the resolution to authorize the speaker and vice-speaker to express the association's appreciation. Mayor Wu and others were all present at the time, and they stood up and modestly declined, saying that as local leaders, handling events was their duty and they dared not accept the commendation.

### Director Zhu Explains the Process of Setting Rental Standards, Land Registration Is 90% Complete, Land Value Tax Collects 28.4 Billion

Director of the Land Administration Bureau Zhu Ping reported on his work and specifically explained the process of setting rental standards, saying that the government had to study and draft a bill on rental standards in terms of both facts and responsibilities. After August of last year, there was a standard for current rent, which was calculated based on 80 percent of the salary multiple of public school teachers, or 1,400 times. In October, it was increased to 3,200 times. But the situation is different this year. Public school teachers' salaries are calculated based on the cost of living index, so the rental multiple implemented last year cannot be applied. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau started research in January, and in accordance with the principle of "considering all aspects" in the resolution of the Provisional Assembly, it invited representatives from various agencies to solicit opinions. First, it was decided that a standard must be set, but a fixed multiple was difficult to establish. Later, a standard for the standard was found, that is, public school teachers' rent is calculated based on 10 percent of the index, or 8,500 times. But it is difficult to solve general problems. Later, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others convened a symposium and decided that the rent for the last three months should be calculated based on the average of the housing index of workers and employees for the first three months and announced every three months. The rent for cultural personnel and the poor is the same as that of public school teachers. In this way, most civilians have been taken care of, and those with ample economic power will not be treated harshly.

Regarding land registration, as of the end of last year, more than 90 percent of the investigations have been completed, and more than 10,000 cases are still under review. Last year's land value tax totaled more than 28.4 billion, exceeding the approved quota by more than 90 percent.

### Councilors Raise Questions, Saying Rental Standards Are Too High

Most of the councilors' questions to the Land Administration Bureau involved the issue of rental standards, and they all expressed opposition. Zhang Zhongyuan said that setting the rental standard at 34,100 times is too high and does not match the actual survey results. Jiang Haoran, a councilor from the Democratic Socialist Party, said that the rental standard should be based on the lowest amount. The current rental multiple has not yet risen to such a high multiple. The authorities have increased it in advance. How does this help "stability first"? Ma Junshuo cited the rental regulations and the Land Law and said that there is no legal basis for determining rent according to the index. Fan Shouyuan said that the rental standard has set the highest amount. This highest amount will naturally become the lowest amount, because no landlord is willing to collect rent below the highest amount. Qian Songping asked about the clearing of public land in suburban areas. Yu Shun asked when the land declaration will be completed.

Director Zhu further explained and answered the "rental issue," saying that the highest rental standard was drafted by the central government. Once it is passed, it will be strictly enforced. Of course, it is also possible to set a lower multiple, but it is useless if the citizens do not comply. This is the original intention of setting this standard to stabilize society. Having a reasonable standard can reduce many disputes and lawsuits. The Legislative Yuan stipulates that the standard should be set according to the local economic situation, so it can be said that there is a legal basis. Director Zhu also explained that the so-called number of 34,100 times is not accurate and not so high. In fact, the calculation method should be as follows: For example, the rent for January, February, and March is calculated based on the average of the pure housing index of workers and employees for October, November, and December. The rent does not change in January, February, and March, and adjustments start in April. At this point, the meeting time had passed. Speaker Pan also added that the issue of rental standards has been submitted to the city government for discussion. You can wait for the discussion of the proposal for a long-term discussion. What is the current multiple has not yet been officially announced. At this point, the questioning came to an end.

### Teachers and Students Petition and Leave After Satisfactory Answers

[Reported by This Newspaper] More than ten petitions were filed to the Municipal Assembly yesterday. Among them, there were about 300 teachers, students, and parents from public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, demanding the distribution of supplies, higher salaries, payment of tuition fees at one time, immediate payment of year-end bonuses, monthly adjustment of the cost of living index, reduction of the burden on parents, free tuition fees should be the responsibility of the government, opposition to asking students for tuition fees, and increasing education funding to 35 percent. Later, Li, Acting Director of the Education Bureau, and Tong Xingbai and Jiang Jizhou, representatives of the Municipal Assembly, met with Shao Shuangqiu and six other representatives of the petition, and Acting Director Li gave a sincere reply, saying that the first two items are central administrative measures and the local authorities have no right to interfere. As for raising unified scholarships in order to increase the number of free places, this is an automatic donation from community members, not a responsibility. However, as he bears the heavy responsibility of managing education, he should care for young people who are determined to study. It has now been decided that for private schools with more than 25 percent of free places, the Education Bureau will be responsible for providing assistance. Students who are truly poor and have excellent grades can apply to the Education Bureau for free admission after verification. Fees charged by private schools exceeding the quota will be personally investigated in each school and ordered to be returned, and those responsible will be punished. If schools delay or deduct teachers' salaries for no reason, they can report to the Education Bureau and will be investigated and dealt with. Finally, he also hoped that all teachers would concentrate on education. The petitioning teachers and students were all satisfied with the above answers and left at about 6:00 PM.

In addition, residents of Tianmu Road once again requested the revocation of the order to demolish houses. The Shanghai Wine and Cuisine Industry Association requested that the banquet tax be reduced to 5 percent, and at most not exceed 12 percent.

### Prisoner Wu Fusheng Commits Murder and Escapes: Crime Upon Crime, Sentenced to Death

[Reported by This Newspaper] Murderer Wu Fusheng, a member of Ding Xishan's troops, robbed a gold ring from the hand of a pedestrian Jin Huagui behind the International Hotel on March 13, 1946.

Yesterday, the District Court sentenced Wu Fusheng to death for the combined crimes of murder and escape.

### Solicitation of Aid Funds Closes at the End of the Month: Hope to Continue Donations to Reach 600 Million in Funds

### Director of Finance Bureau Reports That This Year's Tax Revenue May Exceed 4 Trillion

[Reported by This Newspaper] Director of the Finance Bureau Tian Yongqian reported that the increase in total revenue in 1947 was barely able to cope with the increase in expenditures. However, this year is different. In business tax, the central government will handle special business tax, extracting 23.39 percent, and the manufacturing tax revenue will be halved, resulting in a loss of 17.31 percent. The central government will also extract 30 percent, so the total business tax that the city can collect is only 42 percent. The loss from the ban on dancing accounts for 16.5 percent of the entertainment tax, the loss from bars accounts for 12.5 percent, and the loss from restaurants with dance floors totals 30 percent. If this year's tax revenue is calculated according to the new tax rates set by the central government, 4.3 trillion yuan can be collected. The director said that he personally does not advocate raising taxes.

Regarding financial inquiries, Zhi Fu reported on the fraud of business tax, saying that personnel from the bureau often come to negotiate with general businesses. As soon as the report is about to be issued, if you want to underreport, they can help you through the process, but a handling fee is required. This handling fee is calculated based on the monthly interest rate of the business, with each person taking half. This matter has become an open secret. There are currently more than 60,000 businesses in the city. If each business has an average of 10 million, then the amount is considerable. How will the Finance Bureau deal with it? Li Wenjie expressed the hope that the Finance Bureau should pay attention to the use of money. Yu Shun requested that the city government request subsidies from the central government and reduce the amount of local revenue that is extracted.

Director Tian replied that the bureau will do its best to prevent tax fraud. He was not aware of what Councilor Shi said, but he will sincerely accept it. If the investigation is true, he will definitely deal with it severely.

### Escaped Japanese War Criminal from Jiangwan Captured: Nakano Hisatake First Tried to Escape to the Communist Area in Northern Jiangsu, but Returned to Shanghai Due to Lack of Travel Expenses and Was Arrested

[Reported by This Newspaper] It is confirmed that on the night of December 14 last year, Nakano Hisatake, the former Chief of the Special High Division of the Chongming Gendarmerie of the Japanese War Criminals, escaped from the Jiangwan War Criminals Prison without a trace. After the incident, Chairman Jiang in Nanjing heard about it and was very angry. He ordered the director of the war criminals prison, Zou Renzhi, to be dismissed and investigated. He was transferred to Nanjing a few days ago to await punishment. At the same time, the Ministry of National Defense ordered the escaped war criminal to be arrested. After receiving the order, a military agency in this city sent personnel to investigate separately. After more than ten days of investigation, Nakano Hisatake was finally arrested yesterday afternoon. According to the initial interrogation, after escaping from prison, the criminal intended to flee to the Communist area in northern Jiangsu, but after arriving in Jiading, he returned to Shanghai due to language barriers and lack of travel expenses. He wandered around the area north of Suzhou Creek, making a living by stealing car parts and cotton. He has now been arrested and temporarily sent to the police station for detention. A military agency has telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to report and request instructions on how to deal with the situation.

### Students Insult Mayor Case: Eleven Indicted, Remaining 30 Receive Non-Prosecution, Released on Bail

[Our Dispatch] Students of National Tongji University, previously protesting against the authorities' expulsion of a large number of students and opposing the student self-government association rules promulgated by the Ministry of Education, caused a disturbance. On the 29th of last month, more than 1,000 students gathered, preparing to petition in Nanjing. Students from other universities, including Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Soochow University, Shanghai College of Law, St. John's University, and Tongde Medical College, also went to see them off, numbering in the hundreds. They were blocked by mounted police patrols, and a conflict occurred. Mayor Wu went to mediate and was also insulted and assaulted. Afterwards, forty-one suspected students were arrested and detained at the police station. The case was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After investigation by prosecutors Huang Daping and Zhan Ruilin, the case was closed yesterday. The defendants Huang Kelu, Pan Chengbang, Feng Liwen, Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, Xiong Zonglie, Wang Gongwei, Zhou Yongzhi, Sun Kema, Qu Yuping, and eleven others were indicted on charges of obstructing official duties and disturbing public order. The remaining defendants, Xue Yukun, Cheng Ganheng, Huang Renduan, Chen Minglian, and thirty others, were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence of their crimes. The students who were not prosecuted were all released on bail last night.

The main points of the indictment are excerpted below: "Huang Kelu is the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tongji University Student Self-Government Association and the person in charge of the Nanjing Petition Delegation. Pan Chengbang is the chairman of the Student Self-Government Association and the person in charge of the Nanjing Petition Presidium. Feng Liwen is the vice chairman of the Student Self-Government Association. Wang Zongshu is a standing committee member of the Student Self-Government Association. Wang Weixin is the commander-in-chief of the Nanjing Petition Delegation. All have confessed without reservation. Zhang Jingyao and Xiong Zonglie admitted at the police station that they shouted slogans when organizing the team to petition in Nanjing, asking the students not to be discouraged. The above seven defendants are guilty of inciting others to violate Articles 1 and 2 of the Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order. According to Zhu Yifu's indication, Pan Chengbang, in addition to inciting others to violate the law, also added to the mayor.

Although Wang Gongwei denied assaulting the mayor, Hu Liping, a student from Xia Guang Middle School, testified at this office, 'I saw his back figure hit him, and then Mayor Wu said, 'This is outrageous.' I also saw a person wearing a khaki-colored shirt, who was Wang Gongwei. I saw that there was something wrong with his eyes.' After investigation, Wang Gongwei did have some problems with his eyes, which were particularly recognizable. The above testimony is credible.

Although Zhou Yongzhi also denied rioting, Jiang Hong, the dean of Tongji University, said that he indirectly heard that Zhou Yongzhi had pushed the mayor down, and did something very proud. Later, when this office went to the school to investigate, Jiang Hong said, 'I asked his classmate Shen Zuxuan yesterday, and he said that Zhou Yongzhi often met me on Tianqi Road, his shoes were already thrown off, and he was walking barefoot. Zhou said that he also fell down next to Mayor Wu, and Mayor Wu also fell down, and he pulled him up.' Referring to the above testimony before and after, the defendant is suspected of pushing Mayor Wu down.

Sun Kema is a student at St. John's University. Zhu Yifu testified at the police station, 'First, Sun Kema and Mayor Wu stood opposite each other across a ditch. At that time, Sun Kema loudly questioned the mayor, 'Why were the students Bai Zhao arrested by the police?' and demanded their immediate release. The mayor replied that if any students were arrested, he would be responsible for their release. However, Sun Kema's attitude was still very strong and aggressive, crossing the ditch, with a fierce momentum, ignoring persuasion. Later, when the student petition team rushed out, in the chaos of the mounted police team, Sun stepped forward and surrounded the mayor, reaching out to beat him. I saw it with my own eyes from the side.' Moreover, Sun admitted at the police station that he was impolite to the mayor when crossing the ditch. Even during the investigation in this office, he also admitted that he was unsteady and jumped over the ditch, and had once approached the mayor, using violent and coercive behavior, which can be confirmed.

Qu Yuping is a student at Tongde Medical College and also one of the people who beat the mayor. Zhang Jugong and Zhu Yifu testified clearly. In summary, Huang Kelu and others gathered more than 1,000 people, intending to petition in Nanjing. The victims Wu Guozhen and the police were injured in the conflict. Reporters from various newspapers interviewed and published clearly, and the facts are extremely obvious. The actions of the defendants Pan Chengbang violated Article 135, Paragraph 1, and Article 153, Amendment 2, and Article 50 of the Criminal Law. Huang Kelu, Feng Liwen, Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, and Tai Zonglie violated Article 153, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Wang Gongwei, Zhou Yongzhi, Sun Kema, and Qu Yuping violated Article 135, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Except for the injury part that was not legally prosecuted by the victim, it should be dismissed. They should be indicted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."

### Zhejiang Bandit Captured in Shanghai

[Our Dispatch] The Yulin Road Police Station arrested a notorious bandit from the Zhejiang waters on the 7th of this month in the South City. According to his confession, his name is Zhang Ankang, a native of Dinghai, nicknamed "Mixing Dragon." The interrogation has been completed and reported to the General Bureau, and he will be sent to the court for trial in the coming days.

### Wealthy Household Fate: He Guai Once Kidnapped Three Times, Also Coveted and Blackmailed by Fellow Villagers, Dinghai Road Bridge Contact, Case Cracked

[Our Dispatch] Ho Shao-ting, a 73-year-old contractor from Fenghua, resides at 84 Chang Le Road. On the morning of the 17th of last month, he suddenly received a threatening letter in the name of the "Mao Headquarters," requesting a payment of 40 million yuan to be delivered at 3:00 PM that afternoon near the Linqing Road tram station in Yangshupu. At the time, Ho ignored it. Unexpectedly, around 3:00 PM on the 6th of this month, he received a second threatening letter in the name of the "Yan'an Headquarters," demanding 300 million yuan. Later, Ho's son, Zengke, took the letter to the Lujiawan Police Station to report the case, requesting protection. After inspecting the letter, the police station dispatched plainclothes officers dressed as coppersmiths, farmers, peddlers, and rickshaw pullers to ambush at the agreed-upon Dinghai Road Bridge on the afternoon of the 7th. At the same time, Chen Rusheng, Ho Zengke's uncle, carried a black package in a privately owned car, disguised as cash, straight to the location. Before long, a young man approached, chatting in a low voice with Chen, claiming to be a representative of the "Yan'an Headquarters," ordering him to quickly hand over the cash. The ambushing police officers then swarmed out and captured him. After being taken to the station for interrogation, he confessed that his name was Hua Guoxiang, 21 years old, from Ningbo, and that he had resorted to this as a last resort due to unemployment. His accomplices included Yu Linbiao and Yan Jinlin, all former colleagues at the military uniform factory. The idea came from Yu, because Yu and Ho were from the same village, so he was familiar with his wealth. Based on the confession, the police station rushed to Xicaopeng in Lijia Bang, Nanxiang Town, overnight to arrest Yan. When officers were dispatched to Fenghua to capture the main culprit, Yu Linbiao, he had already fled far away. After investigation, it was learned that Ho was a wealthy man in Fenghua and had been coveted by bandits several times. The first time was in the 14th year of the Republic of China, when his mother was suddenly attacked and kidnapped by a large number of bandits from the Siming Mountains in the countryside of Fenghua, and died in the bandit's den. Ho was very filial to his mother, and later still redeemed his mother's remains and buried them. The second time, Ho himself was kidnapped in Shanghai, at the age of 54, and was shot in the leg on the spot. The third time, in the 31st year of the Republic of China, Ho's two sons were kidnapped to West Shanghai and held captive for more than a month before being redeemed with a huge sum of money.

### The Edge of the Northeast Heart

[By Airmail Dispatch from Shenyang, 14th] The fossil-like ice patterns on the glass windows have disappeared, the snow caps on the treetops have been taken off, and the branches are shedding tears of joy. The crows are cawing noisily, expressing their inner joy and indicating that spring is about to come.

Shenyang is beginning to melt in the ice. The mud on the roads is three feet deep, comparable to the heavy fog in Chongqing. In some places, it has become a quiet lake surface, and a gust of wind allows you to recite the line "Shenyang spring waters rise." The horse manure all over the streets reveals the hateful appearance of garbage piles everywhere. Shenyang is like a candle melting, having lost its winter glory.

Artillery Fire on the South Bank of the Hun River

Shenyang before and after the Spring Festival shows unparalleled desolation. This is the third Spring Festival since the recovery. On the first day of the lunar new year, the air seemed more lively. People observed the ancient traditions, celebrating the new year, greeting each other with bows and hand gestures, giggling, "Congratulations and get rich," and after three or five sentences, they would chatter about "the situation in their hometown." Shenyang has become a world of refugees, numbering over 100,000 and increasing daily. The number of beggars on the streets has also increased several times. An old man recounted that his family property had been cleared out, and children were calling out to you, hoping to get a full meal during the Spring Festival. The Defense Command repeatedly ordered a ban on setting off firecrackers during the Spring Festival, but on the first day of the lunar new year, rumbling artillery fire came from both sides of the Hun River. The children wondered, who dared to set off firecrackers? This is truly the humor of the times.

Facing the Spreading Flames of War

The intense artillery fire slightly shook Shenyang, and the fall of Liaoyang, the key to southern Shenyang, into the hands of the bandits cast a stone in the hearts of the quiet people. Although the siege of Pan Yang made people worried, it did not cause the state of hysterical terror like during the "Fifth Offensive" by the Communists last May. The Northeast has experienced a harsh winter, and people's attitudes have changed to seriousness and perseverance. They have transitioned from emotional and frivolous judgments to rational and calm tests of the current difficult environment. The provocation of reality is enough to inspire courage. Today, people are facing the flames of war burning to the edge of this Northeast heart.

Remembering the Camel Corps

The establishment of the Northeast Bandit Suppression General Headquarters is the most important event of concern to the people of the Northeast. What the Northeast eagerly expects is the dispatch of elite troops to strengthen the Northeast's military and salvage the current crisis, especially to maintain transportation inside and outside the customs. Now, people still remember Fu Zuoyi's camel corps and can't help but beam when talking about Fan Hanjie's mechanized troops.

Population and Cigarette Exchange

The most difficult problem in Shenyang is transportation. Air transport is the only road to the interior. Although China and the Central Aviation Companies have three or five planes flying between Ping and Shen every day, it is still not enough for the needs of Shenyang. Compared to trains, the strength of air transport is really pitiful. Only two or thirty people can travel in a month, which is not even enough for a train. There are many people who want to leave Shenyang. In order to arm itself, Shenyang hopes that all those who want to leave will leave. What it needs here is food, not population. What Shenyang sends out is population, and what it brings back is cigarettes. However, what it desperately needs is flour. This uncoordinated phenomenon has caused great resentment.

Foreigners Willing to Suffer

It is not easy to live in Yang. Foreigners also feel something about it. The livelihoods of many White Russians, Germans, Belgians, and Czechs have declined. Gao Liang rice at 3,000 yuan per catty in the circulating currency makes them very distressed. They have recently been busy looking for ways to get plane tickets. An elderly German man said: He had only tasted this kind of pain in Germany at the end of World War I. He left Germany after the war and has always hated it. When talking about the Nazis, his temper got even worse. He hated Hitler's followers to death. He said that the divided Germany after World War II also had no hope, and he was willing to continue suffering in China. The old man's sorrow made me think that it is not only us Chinese who are suffering on this earth.

Donkey and Horse Meat Abound

The counties near Shenyang are turbulent and uneasy. The coming and going, fighting and stopping of the war make it impossible for the common people to live well. Most of those with savings run to Shenyang. The houses in the Shenyang city gate are crammed full, and rent and sales prices are rising in comparison.

Some of the cattle and horses of the rural farmers have been requisitioned by both sides, and some, fearing the fate of loss, have mostly rushed to the Shenyang Mule and Horse Market and sold them at low prices. Many people who buy livestock do not ask the age of the livestock, but only look at whether they are thin or fat. It is said that these donkeys and horses that were bought were "put in the pot." Isn't that so? The cooked meat market is full of donkey and horse meat.

Chickens, Ducks, Pigs, and Dogs Suffer

Another reason for the rural farmers to sell their plowing mules and horses is that fodder is expensive because a lot of the fodder used to feed mules and horses has been resold for personal gain through extortion and sale - chickens, ducks, pigs, and dogs have suffered the same fate, without the strength to keep them alive until the spring plowing, let alone whether spring plowing is possible, which is a big problem?

The countryside is poor, and the city is in dire straits. Shenyang and its surroundings have suffered together. Food is expensive, everything costs a lot of money, and traffic is cut off, which further increases inflation. Here, oranges cost about 800,000 yuan per catty in legal tender, rice costs about 890,000 yuan per catty in legal tender, Gao Liang rice sells for 60,000 yuan per catty in legal tender, pork costs 240,000 yuan per catty in legal tender, and an egg costs 36,000 yuan per catty in legal tender. How can life not be difficult?

Shenyang has many hardships and certainly needs to be self-reliant, but it also urgently needs national support! (Special Correspondent Han Qingtao. Reporter Zhao Zhan)

### Changsha Warms Up on the Lantern Festival, Lanterns Are Sparse

[Our Dispatch from Changsha, 24th] Today is the Lantern Festival. The weather in Changsha cleared for the first time in February. The spring sun shines, and the climate is warming up. However, the market is sluggish, and the lanterns are sparse, no longer the scene of a prosperous age.

### The Annihilation of Ding Xishan's Bandit Gang

[Our Fengxian Dispatch, 22nd] The local communist bandit gang of Ding Xishan stealthily landed on the beach at Shiqiaotou in Qianqiao Township, this county. They were encircled and attacked by our powerful national army and the security teams and self-defense forces of various counties and townships. Finally, on the 18th, the entire bandit gang was wiped out near Dianshan Lake. The bandit leader, Ding Xishan, was killed on the spot. The local authorities have sent personnel to identify and confirm the body. It is also reported that his head will be taken to Fengxian and displayed to the public. The following is a more systematic account of the encirclement and suppression in Punan, obtained by our reporter from relevant sources, and includes information not yet published in other newspapers.

According to Wang Rong, the bandit gang's chief of staff (and Ding's nephew) who surrendered on the 17th, he told our visiting reporter that on the 28th day of the 12th lunar month of last year, Ding led his gang from Doulonggang in northern Jiangsu, sailing on one large boat and one small boat across the sea. There were only sixty-odd people, carrying five light machine guns, twenty rifles, ten Thompson submachine guns, several various pistols, twelve hundred hand grenades, and over ten thousand rounds of ammunition. They planned to land on New Year's Eve to stealthily attack Fengxian, but due to tidal conditions, they only anchored off Shiqiaotou in Qianqiao Township on the second day of the new year. They landed around 8 or 9 pm on the third night. Due to the inconvenience of carrying the hand grenades, they buried them on the beach. That night, after landing, they went to Panjiajiao in the southwest of this county to rest. The next day (the 13th), they planned to invade Nanqiao. Ding had brought eighteen taels of gold with him for supplies, believing that he could establish a base and rally his old troops after landing in Punan based on his past influence. Therefore, his planned objectives were: (1) to collect the weapons of the self-defense forces in this county, (2) to rally Ding's former subordinates, (3) to recruit new soldiers, (4) to avenge comrades who had been arrested or killed, and (5) to raise funds and provisions. Fortunately, County Magistrate Xi and the stationed troops were well-prepared and had accurate intelligence. As soon as they received a secret report of the bandits' presence, County Magistrate Xi immediately mobilized the county security team, the national army in Nanqiao and Zhalin, and the self-defense teams of Zhuangxing and Zilong townships to encircle and suppress them from multiple routes on the afternoon of the 13th. The bandits were caught off guard and abandoned their packs, fleeing westward in disarray. Our authorities not only sent teams to track them down but also telegraphed the garrison headquarters and the district security headquarters to dispatch powerful reinforcements to block and search for them in different directions. County Magistrate Xi spent the whole day and night on the phone, listening to reports and directing the operations.

On the 15th, the remnants of the bandit gang were discovered again, causing disturbance in Yinglongmiao, on the border of this county. County Magistrate Xi personally led the security and self-defense teams, together with the National Army XX Regiment, to encircle and suppress them. At the same time, Zhu Zhong, Deputy Commander of the 3rd District Security Department of Songjiang, also personally led his team to join the encirclement and attack. The bandits had no chance to catch their breath and were finally defeated by our army, scattering westward in two groups like fallen flowers. One group of ten or twenty people, led by Tang Jingyan, the deputy commander of the bandit gang, fled to Wangjiadai in Yanduntou. When our defense teams reported and encircled them, the bandits had already broken into smaller groups and slipped through the gaps to cross the Pu River and flee westward. The other group of forty or fifty bandits, led by Ding himself, tried to flee to Dianshan Lake but were completely surrounded by our powerful national army units and security and self-defense teams from various counties and districts. They were attacked from all sides, and finally, on the 18th, the entire bandit gang was wiped out. The bandit leader, Ding Xishan, was killed on the spot. The good news spread, and the people were overjoyed.

The complete annihilation of Ding's bandit gang in Punan in the shortest possible time was due to the close coordination, accurate intelligence, high morale, and diligent efforts of the powerful national army units and local security and guard teams. County Magistrate Xi's ability to raise vigilance and command decisively before the bandits could establish a foothold, and his giving them a fierce blow first, should also not be overlooked in this campaign.

Ding was originally from Wujiaqiao Town in this county (previous reports stated Zhuangxing, which was incorrect). Before the war, he was a kidnapper. In 1936, he was imprisoned for kidnapping. He was released only after the outbreak of the War of Resistance. He joined the guerrillas and was active in southeastern Pudong. Later, he surrendered to the puppet regime and served as a puppet division commander, stationed in both northern and southern Pujiang, with great influence. Later, he was transferred to Shaoxing by the enemy and puppet regime. He attempted to defect to our side but was discovered by the Japanese enemy and imprisoned. He later managed to escape from prison and went to the free area. Before the victory, Ding led his troops to Fengxian. After the restoration and reorganization, he was reassigned to the traffic police and stationed in Qingdao. Last summer, he was wanted by the Ministry of National Defense for a case. Ding secretly joined the bandits, gathered his old troops, and went to the bandit area in northern Jiangsu for training. Ding was inherently stubborn, arrogant, and capricious. According to the bandit staff officer Wang Rong, who surrendered on the 17th and is now living in the county police station, after the Zhang Xianghe bandit case last year, he was implicated and fled to Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Pixian. Later, he returned to Shanghai. Ding ordered him to go with him, deceiving him by saying that they were going to Shanxi and that Commander-in-Chief Ma Zhichao would also go. They took a sailboat and went to the bandit area in northern Jiangsu, where he found out the truth. When he first arrived in northern Jiangsu, he had no official title. Later, he was appointed as a "battalion commander." When they set off, he was appointed as the chief of staff. The bandits' life was two bowls of porridge and one meal a day, and only 1,200 yuan per month in "Central China Bank" banknotes. He was not accustomed to the life and did not want to leave a bad name, so after landing in Qianqiao, he made an excuse to go home and make arrangements. On the fourth day of the new year (the 13th), he left the bandit gang and tried to surrender to the authorities. (Our Correspondent, Wang Jianqiu)

### Flying Locusts Discovered in Southern Anhui; One Million Pine Trees Devastated; Heavy Losses in Xiuning and Wuyuan Counties

[Our Wuyuan Dispatch, 21st] Flying locusts were discovered in the northern part of this county, from Tuochuan Yuan to Dalian in the neighboring county of Xiuning, causing severe damage. The locusts are slightly smaller than the locusts that appear in the summer and resemble long-legged wasps. They fly in swarms and eat the evergreen pine needles in the forests. The locusts stay on the pine trees, jumping and moving incessantly, like silkworms eating mulberry leaves, making a rustling sound. The continuous spring snow, accumulating to over a foot thick, slightly suppressed the locust plague. After the Spring Festival, the snow cleared and the weather warmed up, and the locusts continued to wreak havoc as before. The locusts have spread over dozens of miles, and the ancient pine forests that once covered the borders of Xiuning and Wuyuan counties have all become barren and withered. According to the mountain farmers, after the pine needles are bitten by the locusts, the resin is completely drained, and the trees will eventually die. It is estimated that over one million pine trees in the two counties have been eaten, representing an unprecedented and huge loss to the forests of Huizhou.

### Deng Meikui, Leader of Tenant Farmers in Yiyang, Murdered

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 24th] In Hunan, the "Two-Five Rent Reduction" policy is being strictly enforced.

On the 2nd of this month, before Deng got out of bed, six men in short clothes, carrying weapons, broke into Deng's house, tied him up, dragged him to the edge of a deep pit more than ten feet away from his house, and shot him three times, killing him.

### Extravagant Gambling in Overseas Chinese Hometowns: Using US Dollars as a Desperate Gamble

### Mei Zhanyi Arrives in Suzhou to Review Military Service in Three Counties

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 24th] Major General Mei Zhanyi, Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, arrived in Suzhou from Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning to convene a military service review meeting for Wu County, Wujiang, and Changshu. Du Xu, the commander of the Wu County Regiment Management District, and all levels of directors, as well as the county magistrates and military section chiefs of the three counties, were summoned to attend and listen to instructions. In the afternoon, Mei inspected the new recruits' brigade and returned to Shanghai by train number 71 that evening. Our reporter inquired about the date of the upcoming conscription, as there are conflicting rumors circulating and the people are at a loss. Mei said that all areas under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Garrison District will implement it simultaneously, without precedence, to prevent some ignorant young men from evading it. It has now been decided that the period until the end of this month will be the preparation period, and the drawing of lots will begin in March, with the conscription order issued at the same time.

### Antiques of the Ancient Capital

[Our Xi'an Airmail Dispatch, 20th] China is an ancient country, and Chang'an (now Xi'an) is an ancient capital. Therefore, it is not surprising to see antiquities from hundreds or thousands of years ago here. Several old gentlemen from the Shaanxi Provincial History Museum and private collectors have told our reporter that as long as roads are built in Guanzhong, airports are built, irrigation canals are dug, and even sometimes when a well is dug, ancient objects such as pottery, clayware, stoneware, and bronzeware are unearthed. (Not long ago, someone dug up hundreds of ancient clay figurines for funerary purposes, the so-called "terracotta warriors," at a construction site. Later, they realized that it was an ancient tile kiln for making "terracotta warriors.") The excavation of antiquities is no longer surprising news in Chang'an.

Objects of crude pottery, like "terracotta warriors", that are very old are not worthy of being placed in glass display cabinets in Xi'an's antique shops. When unearthed, they are still piled up on the floor of chairs and tables. An insider said that these cheap antiques are rarely faked. Therefore, Chairman Lin Sen liked to collect them. Although Qin bricks and Han tiles unearthed near Xi'an are constantly being smuggled out, many are still preserved. The texts, patterns, and designs on the bricks and tiles are worth appreciating. Speaking of the patterns on the back of ancient mirrors, they are even more complex and diverse. Recently, a collector exhibited hundreds of different ancient mirrors during the Spring Festival. Even if we don't consider them to be products of the Han and Tang Dynasties, the exquisite patterns are often breathtaking. Scattered stone carvings that are unearthed sometimes also have high artistic value.

At the same antique exhibition, our reporter discovered a fragmented statue of unknown age, about three feet high, with its hair rolled high on its forehead and draped over its shoulders. The clothing on its chest was partially bare, with the breasts exaggeratedly enlarged and the waist exaggeratedly narrowed, forming a contrast. (The nipples are also emphasized). The lines of the body only widen again at the local pelvis, and the hem of the lower garment has a "round taste". What is even more ingenious is that the two calves below the knee are completely naked. Unfortunately, the foot part is missing; otherwise, if there were a pair of high heels, it would be a 100% "Madhavi"! - From this, we can know that the so-called "fashion" is just a cycle of rotation in the ages, going round and round. The Shaanxi Provincial History Museum is located in the famous "Stele Forest", and its collection is also quite rich, but it is still not open to the public. After visiting, our reporter was most interested in the "terracotta warriors" and "funerary objects", which will be reported in another article when the opportunity arises. (Our Reporter, Ma Ye)

### Xi'an Spring Couplet Fully Reveals the Plight of Tenants

[Our Xi'an Airmail Dispatch, 19th] Xi'an is experiencing a housing shortage, and the rental standard regulations promulgated by the municipal government are probably only beneficial to the residents of municipal government properties. This year, during the grand New Year, a unique spring couplet was posted at No. 28 Yandian Street, known as the "Wall Street" of Xi'an, which revealed the severity of the rent problem here. The two sides of the spring couplet read: "Our housing is too expensive" and "The rent is going to increase fourteenfold." Above the door lintel, the three characters "Cannot Afford" are written horizontally.

Today, our reporter went to the door to take pictures. The owner, Yang Xiaojie, came out with his hands clasped, speaking with a Shanxi accent, and told our reporter that the rent increase was unreasonable. He also said, "I am a long-time reader of Shen Bao. Please, please, let Shen Bao speak up for us." (Our Reporter, Ma Ye)

### Number of New Students in Guangzhou Municipal Elementary and Secondary Schools Only One-Tenth of Last Year; High Prices Make it Impossible for Parents to Afford Education for Their Children

[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou, 24th Dispatch] The winter vacation for Guangzhou municipal and provincial elementary and secondary schools has ended, and classes resumed on the 23rd. However, the number of new students enrolled in major elementary and secondary schools has decreased significantly, only reaching one-tenth of last year's number.

After the power company sent craftsmen to repair the lights, the third game, Renyu vs. Qingbai, was held as scheduled.

In the last few minutes, the score was tied repeatedly, with equal scores of 34, 37, and 39, making it difficult to determine the winner. Renyu scored consecutively by Wang Huaiting and Yao Wenyi, finally winning by four points, 43 to 39. The score in the first half was also very tense, with Renyu leading by only one point, 27 to 26. Jianle defeated Tisheng by a wide margin, 80 to 49, completely one-sided.

Da Yun scored, and Renyu called a timeout. However, Qingbai still took the lead. At 22 to 26, Renyu scored three consecutive points, tying the score at 26. Xianglong fouled, and Wang Huaiting scored a free throw. The first half ended at this time, with Renyu leading by one point, 27 to 26.

Renyu's Xinyun and Pengju scored one shot and one free throw each. Qingbai called a timeout and replaced Zhang Shaoqing with Zhuo Guorong. Renyu also put Yao Wenyi on the court, replacing Xu Zhongyi. Xiao Yao took the court and immediately scored a point. Wang Huaiting scored a point, tying the score for the second time at 34. Then the score became 37. Xu Heng scored, and Xiao Yao retaliated, making the score 39. When Huaiting and Xiao Yao scored, the time had ended, and Renyu defeated Qingbai again by a score of 43 to 39.

Jianle Defeats Tisheng by a Wide Margin

In the Division A2 game between Jianle and Tisheng, played under dim lighting, Zhou Huaibang and Zheng Zhifang officiated. After being defeated by Green Forest the other day, all the veterans of Jianle fought desperately yesterday and showed their power, especially Jin Kun and Zhang Xianlun, who were very active. Jin scored 30 points alone, which was very rare. After the start of the game, Tisheng once led by 6 to 2, but Jianle soon surpassed them. Tisheng called two timeouts, but it still didn't work. After 13 to 12, Jianle scored 14 consecutive points. As a result, Tisheng was behind by half at 20 to 40. After the change of sides, Jianle still controlled the overall situation. Tisheng's Tang Mingxin and Chen Wenzao scored a lot, but it was not worth the loss. When the bell rang, Jianle defeated Tisheng by a wide margin of 80 to 49.

### Social Affairs Bureau Decides to Sell Rice Unlimitedly from Today; Rice Market in Chaos Yesterday, Asking Prices Rise Sharply Again

[Our Newspaper's Report] Rice prices fluctuated sharply yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to resume unlimited sales of rice in the market from today to meet the needs of the citizens. The sales price is 2.25 million yuan per stone, and the retail price is calculated by adding 6% legal profit. At the same time, all retail rice shops are required to mark their prices, and the police bureau will send personnel to patrol each district. Violators will be severely punished.

Yesterday, the Nanshi rice market registered 3351 stones and 5 dou of goods arriving, and the Beishi market registered 3533 stones and 5 dou. All parties believe that the authorities' relaxation of price limits should stabilize the market. However, due to the soaring prices in Wuxi districts, customers fear that they will not be able to replenish their stock after selling it, so they refuse to release it, resulting in a shortage of goods and a chaotic market, with transactions almost at a standstill. Rice shops in this street have stopped allocating rice, so there are no goods to replenish in the market. Therefore, they do not hesitate to increase prices to buy in, but only a few are doing business. In addition, stimulated by the rise in other prices, people are unsettled, and asking prices are rising sharply again. Special white japonica rice reached a new high price of over 2.5 million yuan, a surge of more than 10% compared to the previous day.

The rise in flour prices is like a horse running wild, completely out of control. The reported rise in tin prices is the most exciting factor, and the factory's refusal to sell is the main reason for stimulating the rise in the flour market. Owners are asking exorbitant prices, but there is no shortage of buyers. At the opening in the morning, old cart flour was as high as 1.32 million yuan, and Bingshen flour rose all the way to a new record of 1.3 million yuan. Retailers took profits and sold at high prices, and the trend stabilized. Old cart flour closed at 1.29 million yuan, and Bingshen flour closed at 1.28 million yuan, a rise of almost 15% compared to the previous day. There was no shortage of buyers for bran, which opened at 790,000 yuan in the morning and once rose to 830,000 yuan. Finally, due to the slight decline in the flour market, it closed at 800,000 yuan, a rise of 30,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

Due to the soaring rice prices, the price of coarse grains and yellow beans increased and the customers absorbed all available goods from Hankou at a morning opening price of 1.55 million yuan, which increased to 1.6 million yuan due to inability to acquire supply. Corn opened due to demand from Qingdao traders. Qi dong corn was at 1.78 million and reached 1.85 million at closing, with a price rise of approximately 200,000 yuan. Sorghum and mung beans all rose 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. Sesame of Tianjin was actively purchased with Hankou white sesame doing 3.4 million for a gain of 300,000 and Jiujiang milk sesame at 2.95 million for a gain of 200,000. Raw peanuts jumped up by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

Under the crazy price increase for rice and grains, edible oil and Wuxi prices constantly rising with a loose banking system where excess funds seeped in, edible oil price increases were even more insane, creating new highs. Yesterday's market was even more extreme, with abnormal conditions and very little product to purchase. Sellers were asking astounding prices, and raw oil was trading for 6.6 million, an increase of 800,000. Soybean oil opened at 5.8 million, reaching 6 million at one point and coming down to 5.9 million for an increase of 620,000. Rapeseed and sesame oil all rose by 600,000 and transactions were limited due to the lack of available goods. Soy meal followed with the oil prices, surging by 60-70,000 yuan.

Citizens are extremely anxious and hope that the authorities will take effective measures to stabilize prices. Soong Ziwen has already telegraphed back to Guangdong, instructing that all possible measures be taken to effectively stabilize prices and ensure that grain prices in the province quickly recover.

### U.S. Revision of Gold Policy Currently Unnecessary

[Our Dispatch] A United Press dispatch from New York recently reported on the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers' proposal for a new gold price. Our reporter specially visited an economic expert in this city who stated: At present, a revision of the gold policy in the United States is practically impossible. Although gold production in the United States has faced rising labor costs since the war, production has continued to increase. Last year, total production reached $80 million, nearly half of the peak production of 1940 before the war. Furthermore, there has been a large influx of gold from foreign countries after the war. Therefore, there is no need to further increase the price of gold to stimulate gold production. With the European Recovery Program underway, there is no concern about exports, and there is even less reason to lower the value of the dollar by raising the gold price to create commercial competition. Recently, with France's opening of its gold market, foreign countries inevitably make various speculations about the American gold market. In fact, France is not the only place in the world with a free gold market, and the United States is in a different situation and has no need to follow suit.

### Money Shops Have Already Loaned Out 600 Million Yuan in Small Loans

[Our Dispatch] The city's money shop small loan syndicate has, since its establishment, already underwritten more than 110 cases, with a total amount of over 600 million yuan. Today, the syndicate will convene a joint meeting of the review and auditing groups to review the loan work, it is said.

### National Banks Transfer Large Amounts In; Monetary Conditions Still Relaxed

At the beginning of the new year, national banks have large daily transfers in, with another transfer of 464.4 billion yuan yesterday. Statistics show that since the Spring Festival, the total amount transferred in has reached a huge sum of over 2.7 trillion yuan. However, monetary conditions in the market remain quite relaxed. The flow of idle funds from other areas into Shanghai is greater than the tightening of monetary conditions by the national banks, resulting in an abundance of cash. Also, yesterday's "check clearing totaled 87,782 items, with a total amount reaching 4,476,808,628,000 yuan."

### Tea Market Sentiment Firm

Domestic tea sales continued the upward trend of the previous day, coupled with the continued strong buying interest from both local and out-of-town merchants. Amidst the soaring prices of all goods, this further strengthened market confidence, and sellers' intention to raise prices became even more intense. As a result, the underlying bullish sentiment became even stronger, and prices uniformly rose step by step, to an extent that was almost immeasurable. However, trading volume was still sparse due to the shortage of supply. As for the foreign tea market, the process remained quiet, mainly due to the extremely high tea prices, and the interest of exporters was intermittent and not active. The opening prices rebounded again in a roundabout way.

### Crackdown on Speculation in Yarn and Cloth; Yarn Control Committee Sends Inspectors; Market Must Report Daily Transaction Volume

[Our Dispatch] Due to the recent severe fluctuations in yarn prices, the Yarn Control Committee, in order to prevent speculation by non-industry individuals and curb rising prices, specially sent Director Weng of the Inspection Department, along with several inspectors, to the yarn and cloth markets yesterday morning (the 24th), accompanied by Section Chief Liu of the Daily Necessities Section of the Police Bureau, and economic police, to crack down on speculation by non-industry individuals and price gouging. The responsible personnel of the two markets were instructed to report the transaction volume of each broker yesterday to the guild for verification and transfer. Starting immediately, the transaction volume must be entered on the transaction slip, with one copy each for the buyer and seller, and the remaining copy sent to the yarn and cloth group for auditing. In the yarn market, in addition to the Yarn Merchants Guild Director Yin Peiyuan and Yarn Control Committee Inspection Department Director Weng announcing on the spot a strict crackdown on speculation, an emergency notice was immediately posted.

Furthermore, in order to understand the yarn allocation status of each business and prevent speculation and hoarding, the Yarn Control Committee specially sent personnel to the acting agency of the China Textile Construction Corporation yesterday to investigate the allocated merchants and the amount of yarn allocated, in order to thoroughly investigate and handle the situation.

Yarn Prices Decline

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a decline in prices. The Yarn Control Committee's restrictions on shipments to the south remained in effect, and measures such as inspecting warehouses and registering yarn numbers were implemented, causing market sentiment to weaken suddenly. Buyers reduced their purchases, and both local and out-of-town merchants showed less interest, leading to a collapse in prices. 41-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened hovering around the 90 million yuan mark, but later, speculators took the opportunity to short the market, pushing the price down to 89 million yuan at closing, a sharp drop of 5 million yuan compared to the previous day. More of the 21-count "Double Horse" yarn was sold off, with prices falling by 5.5 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn fell generally from 1.89 million to 5.45 million yuan.

Cloth Prices Slightly Weaken

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with a weaker tone, influenced by the weak yarn market, causing panic among traders, and many floating accounts rushed to cut losses. Hankou and Guangdong merchants also sold off, and asking prices were more chaotic than usual. 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth once fell to 2.13 million yuan, but dye factories and cloth merchants absorbed the supply at the lower price, resulting in a rebound to 2.27 million yuan at closing, a slight increase of 25,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other fine cloth also fell by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan. "Zhen Zhong" cloth, with its active sales, rose by 50,000 yuan. In addition, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and fabrics such as zigong floral drill and shilin cloth continued to rise by about 10,000 to 200,000 yuan.

Raw Cotton Weak

Yesterday's raw cotton market was weak due to the decline in cotton yarn prices and weakening market sentiment. Buyer interest waned, the market was oversupplied, and trading was thin, with only 70 bales traded. 8/7 middling cotton opened at 12.235 million yuan, and Guide cotton at 10.91 million yuan, these prices being the godown delivery prices. Zhoupu seed cotton, due to rising rice prices, farmers were unwilling to sell easily, and prices in the production areas increased, with the trend remaining high. Yesterday's opening price was 2.4 million yuan.

[Our Dispatch] China Textile Construction Corporation sold cloth yesterday as usual, with a total of 28,880 bolts of cloth and 830 bedsheets sold. There were 1,004 applications, of which 44 were from manufacturers, purchasing 2,060 bolts of cloth, and the rest were purchased by various cloth shops.

### China Trust Bureau Begins Purchasing Western Medicines and Communications Equipment

[Our Dispatch] The China Trust Bureau (CTB) began yesterday to carry out compulsory purchases of imported goods with self-provided foreign exchange. Initially, the purchase of finished Western medicines and communications equipment will be conducted, while the procurement of burlap sacks will be postponed.

Similarly, for communications equipment, the original importer will have one month from the date of the announcement to complete the purchase procedures. If the importer fails to do so, the CTB will request instructions from the Executive Yuan on how to proceed. After purchasing these goods, the CTB will allocate them to the Ministry of National Defense, while the burlap sacks will be allocated to the Ministry of Food.

Literature

### Woman Writer Freda Utley

— Wang Yu

Everyone should remember this female writer—Freda Utley—who once wrote a book called "Japan's Feet of Clay." At a time when Japan was invading China while singing praises of friendship, she exposed the truth about Japan and aroused the attention of the British and American people. She was one of the first people who were willing to help China. The book had attracted many American readers. The Chinese translation was also once very popular. When she came to Chongqing after the victory, there were still many people who mentioned the book.

She grew up in England, went to Switzerland, studied history at the University of London, and economics at the London School of Economics. She was very well-regarded. Later, she went to the Soviet Union to become one of the Far East experts at the Moscow Institute of Political Economy. She married a Soviet comrade and lived with him for six years until her husband was taken away by the secret police. Only then did she escape to the United States. When she was disappointed in the Soviet Union, she wrote a book called "Lost Illusion." After her husband was imprisoned in a concentration camp, she wrote another book called "The Dream We Lost," which recounted her life experiences.

She was a journalist and worked as a correspondent for the Manchester Guardian, the London News Chronicle, and Reader's Digest. While in Shanghai, she also wrote articles for the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury.

She visited China three times: the first time in 1928, during the split between the Nationalists and the Communists. The second time was in 1938, which was the second year of the War of Resistance, and she escaped on the eve of the fall of Wuhan. She witnessed China's War of Resistance with her own eyes. The third time was in 1945, first to Chongqing and then to Yan'an. She was in Chongqing when the Political Consultative Conference was held.

She has recently written another book called "The China Story," which has sixteen chapters, in which she strenuously advocates that the United States must immediately provide comprehensive aid to China in terms of morality and its own practical interests. She believed that the United States must at least lend China two to three billion U.S. dollars in order to revive China. She is an expert on Far Eastern issues, understands the actual situation in China, and also understands the psychology of the American people. Her analysis is very clear and understandable. Her writing style is very fluent, and she excels at writing political commentary, speaking eloquently, and with warmth.

She criticized American foreign policy, saying that its weakness lies not in its inconsistency, but in its indecisiveness, so it cannot achieve its goals. The United States often fails to adopt a tough foreign policy to prevent the outbreak of war at critical moments. If it had severed economic ties with Japan at the beginning of its invasion of China, then why would it have had to fight so many bloody battles later?

She said that the United States still has time to adopt a wise, far-sighted, and practical policy towards China, which is to use all its strength to support China and prevent it from fighting alone for the sake of democratic countries.

### Reunion - Film Script (4)

— Zhang Dao

30. Zheng Jingye's Bedroom (December 1946)

Jingye is half-reclining on a sofa chair in his bedroom. Xiuzhen is sitting at a long table beside her, writing.

Jingye: (After reading the words written by Xiuzhen in his hand.) You write very well. You must write every day from now on, don't be lazy.

Xiuzhen: Okay, I won't be lazy. (Opens a drawer and takes out a photo of a baby, which is the one Jingye collected back then.) Mr. Zheng, whose photo is this?

Jingye: (Surprised.) Where did you get this?

Xiuzhen: I found it in your diary. When we were in Guilin, my dad had a photo of me when I was little, and it was the same as this one.

Jingye: (Changes the subject.) This is a photo of my friend's child. It must be different from the one your dad has.

Mrs. Zheng: (Suddenly pushes the door open, holding a newspaper in her hand.) Xiuzhen, what's your mother's name? I forgot.

Xiuzhen: It's, it's, Guo Canyun.

Mrs. Zheng: (Very happy.) Then that's right! (Xiuzhen and Jingye are both confused.)

Jingye: (Asks anxiously.) What's right?

Mrs. Zheng: (Picks up the newspaper and reads.) Listen to this! "He Qi's Missing Person Notice:

When the enemy invaded Guizhou in early December 1944, my wife, Guo Canyun, took our eight-year-old daughter, Xiuzhen, and fled to Guizhou. The mother and daughter were separated in the bombing chaos in Liuzhai. My daughter is still missing. My wife and I have now returned to Shanghai. If any kind person can help find my daughter, I will send a reward of 20 million yuan. Sincerely, He Qi. Address: No. 1001 Anhe Temple Road, Shanghai. Telephone: 99990." (After Mrs. Zheng finishes reading, she looks at Jingye. Jingye has complex emotions and is a little dazed. Xiuzhen doesn't seem to fully understand the contents of the notice yet.) Xiuzhen, do you understand?

Xiuzhen: Auntie, does that mean my mother has been found?

Jingye: (Calmly.) Yes. Xiuzhen, your parents have placed an advertisement looking for you. Now that we know their address, we can ask them to come and take you back.

Xiuzhen: (Looking very happy, but seeing that Jingye is not very happy, she doesn't dare to show it. She runs to Jingye's side.) Mr. Zheng, why don't you come and live at my house too, okay?

Jingye: (Jingye hugs her lovingly.) Good child, how can I go and live at your house?

Xiuzhen: (About to cry.) Why can't you? You treat me well, and I want to be with you.

Mrs. Zheng: Silly child! Aren't you happy that you have a mother? Mr. Zheng is going to live in our house. Little sister, let's go downstairs and discuss it, okay?

(Xiuzhen is still in the room. Jingye and Mrs. Zheng go downstairs.)

31. Zheng Family Living Room

Jingye: (Feeling very uncomfortable, pacing back and forth in the room. Sister-in-law is also silent. Finally, he makes a decision.) Sister-in-law, please call the He family and tell them that we will send Xiuzhen to them tomorrow afternoon.

Mrs. Zheng: Little sister, are you sure that's what you want to do? Don't you want to think about it more carefully?

Jingye: No need. Please just make the call.

Mrs. Zheng: (Probing.) Hmph! Returning their daughter to them for only 20 million yuan is too cheap. We should ask for 100 million!

Jingye: Sister-in-law, we can't do that.

Mrs. Zheng: Why not?

Jingye: No reason! (Anxiously.) If you don't make the call, I'll make it myself.

Mrs. Zheng: Of course I'll make it. (Hesitates for a while, picks up the phone on the table, and dials the number.)

Hello! Is this 99990? ... Is this the He residence? Please let Mr. He Qi answer the phone. ... Mr. He has gone to Hong Kong, so can Mrs. He talk instead? ...

32. He Qi's New Home Living Room, Shanghai

Canyun is knitting a wool sweater in the room. The servant comes to inform her.

Servant: Madam, there's a phone call.

(Canyun walks out the door and answers the phone by the stairs.)

Canyun: Hello! Who is this? Yes. Oh, the Zheng residence, this is Mrs. He. Yes, my name is Guo Canyun. We posted the advertisement. What? Xiuzhen is with you? (Delighted.) May I ask where you live? 918 Ferguson Road? Can I come to your house right away? Okay, I'll be there right away!

(Canyun hangs up the phone. Very happy, she dials a number again.)

Canyun: Please send a car to the He residence at No. 1001 Anhe Temple Road immediately. Hurry!

33. Road

A taxi from the Xiang Sheng Company speeds to the front of the Zheng family's house.

34. In Front of Zheng Family's House

The car stops. Canyun gets out of the car, pays the fare, rings the doorbell, and the Zheng family's servant leads her inside.

35. Zheng Family Living Room

Mrs. Zheng is in the living room. Canyun enters the living room.

Canyun: I am Guo Canyun. Are you Mrs. Zheng?

Mrs. Zheng: Yes, Mrs. He, please sit down. (The two sit down separately)

Canyun: (Hesitantly.) Mrs. Zheng, I hope what you told me on the phone is true, that is truly my daughter. There shouldn't be any mistake, right?

Mrs. Zheng: (Smiling) I couldn't dare to be sure about that! Wait until I call her out, and you can recognize her for yourself. (Walks to the back door of the living room and calls out loudly.) Xiuzhen! Come quickly!

Xiuzhen: (Runs down the stairs, into the living room.) Auntie, what's the matter? (After just saying that, she sees Canyun, and seems afraid to recognize her.)

Canyun: (As soon as she sees Xiuzhen, she recognizes her immediately. She is extremely happy. She runs over, squats down, and hugs Xiuzhen.) Xiuzhen! Don't you recognize your mother anymore?

Xiuzhen: (Confirms that it's her, and hugs Canyun's neck.)

Mom! Mom! Ah! Mom!

Canyun: Mom has been so worried about you! I never thought I would be able to find you.

(Mother and daughter are filled with happy tears. Mrs. Zheng is watching from the side, very touched, smiling but not saying anything.)

Canyun: Mrs. Zheng, I really don't know how to thank you enough. When you called just now, I really couldn't believe it. Now I can finally prove that it wasn't a dream. Can you tell me how you found Xiuzhen?

Mrs. Zheng: I didn't find her. My younger sister brought her back from Guiyang.

Canyun: Where is your sister? Can you introduce me to her?

Mrs. Zheng: Of course. But she was feeling a bit unwell just now. Let me go and take a look.

Xiuzhen: Auntie, Mr. Zheng was crying upstairs just now.

Mrs. Zheng: Ah! (Exits the living room and goes upstairs.)

Canyun: (Asks Xiuzhen.) Which Mr. Zheng was crying?

Xiuzhen: It's the Doctor Zheng who brought me back. I always call him Mr. Zheng.

Canyun: (Understands that Jingye is reluctant to return Xiuzhen.) Does she treat you well?

Xiuzhen: She treats me very well. She loves me very much.

Canyun: Do you like her too?

Xiuzhen: I love her very much.

(The sound of someone coming down the stairs. Mrs. Zheng and Jingye enter the living room. Jingye looks a little reluctant, but she remains very calm and composed.)

Mrs. Zheng: (To Canyun.) Mrs. He, this is my younger sister, Doctor Zheng Jingye.

Canyun: (Sees Jingye and is inexplicably surprised. She steps forward and shakes hands with Jingye.) Mr. Zheng.

Jingye: (Calmly, forcing a smile.) Mrs. He!

Canyun: Thank you for bringing Xiuzhen back. I don't know how to thank you enough.

Jingye: Mrs. He, you don't need to say that. "Helping others is the source of happiness." I unintentionally helped you find your daughter, which is also a happy thing for me. As for how I found Xiuzhen, I think she can tell you slowly.

Canyun: (Feels a little strange, not knowing what to do, it's hard to speak.) Mr. Zheng, we said in the newspaper that we would send a reward. Now I have prepared a check for 20 million yuan. I hope you will accept it. (Opens her handbag and takes out the check.)

Jingye: (Reveals a slight displeasure.) Mrs. He, please don't do that. When I took her in, it was entirely out of pity and love for her. I had no other purpose. Today, I am returning her to you, so that you and your daughter can be reunited. It is definitely not for the sake of a reward.

Xiuzhen: Mom, Mr. Zheng doesn't want money.

Canyun: How can that make me feel at ease?

Jingye: You don't need to think that way. If you want, you can take Xiuzhen back now. We can talk slowly later.

Mrs. Zheng: Xiuzhen still has a lot of clothes here. We will send them to your house tomorrow.

Xiuzhen: (Suddenly runs from her mother's side to hug Jingye.) Mr. Zheng, let's go home together. If you don't go, I won't go either. (Starts to cry.)

Jingye: (Caresses her lovingly.) Silly child, that's your home, this is my home. How can I go with you? (Starts to tear up after saying that.)

(Canyun and Mrs. Zheng are watching from the side, and they also feel sad.)

Xiuzhen: If you don't go with me, I won't go - I won't go! (Cries.)

Jingye: (Also cries.) No, Xiuzhen, don't be like this. You go back first. I'll come and see you often in the future, okay? If you don't listen, I won't come to see you in the future.

Xiuzhen: (With tears in her eyes, nods.) Okay, okay, I'll listen.

Jingye: Okay, then go back with Mom first. (Pushes her to her mother's side. Canyun pulls Xiuzhen.)

Canyun: Mr. Zheng, I feel really bad for making you feel uncomfortable.

Jingye: It's nothing.

Canyun: Then we'll leave now, and come to see you again tomorrow. (Everyone walks to the door together without saying a word.)

Xiuzhen: (Bows to Jingye.) Goodbye! Mr. Zheng! (Bows to Mrs. Zheng.) Goodbye! Zheng Auntie!

Jingye: Mrs. Zheng: Goodbye: Xiuzhen!

(After Canyun and her daughter leave, Jingye and Mrs. Zheng return to the living room. At this moment, Jingye can no longer control her emotions, and she starts to cry loudly. Mrs. Zheng comforts her.)

Mrs. Zheng: Little sister, don't be like this. Of course children are lovely, but they are always someone else's. You can still see her often in the future.

Jingye: Sister-in-law, you don't know how much I love this child. [To be continued]

### Xiao Yinghui Fen's Paintings

— Wu Jingheng

In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, I founded a specialized art school in my hometown of Liangxi. At that time, famous artists, such as Hu Tinglu and He Tianjian, all helped and taught, cultivating many talented artists. Xiao Yinghui was intelligent and diligent in her studies, and she was especially outstanding at the time. Xiao Yinghui has been away from the school for twenty years, traveling all over the country, engaging in sketching, and studying the works of previous masters, so her attainments have become even deeper. Now, at the request of people in Shanghai, she is exhibiting her recent works at the China Art Garden for seven days starting from February 21st. I usually don't like to write articles to promote people, but Xiao Yinghui is indeed the real deal. I dare to tell those who love art. Written by Wu Jingheng at the age of eighty-four, in the Six-One-Eight Hut.

Words for the Chrysanthemum Longevity Gathering

The "Words for the Chrysanthemum Longevity Gathering" were written by Yao Zhixiang (Huidi) of Huixian, Henan, and published in the year of Ji Si during the reign of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty. Mr. Wu Pingqi (Yun) did the calligraphy. Yao and Wu were related through marriage. The collection of words consists of four volumes, of which only one selection from the Futang Leirong Selection is seen, without anyone having glimpsed the whole picture. Recently, the original edition was found, with a preface by Yao Meibo and a postscript by Jiang Jianren, both praising it to the highest degree. Here are a few excerpts for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts of ci poetry.

One, Ode to the Autumn Colors of Shiyuan Garden

East of the orchid, I love the returning yellow turning green; autumn resides in the fine silk of Liu. Watching the irrigation of the rainbow silk, the sunset shines like phoenix brocade, cutting the colorful silk, still recognizing the Sui Palace. Able to bear the beautiful charm of the frost goddess, how many colors there are, learning from the red maples; the ground is covered with cold dew, a new goose in the sky, urging the dyeing of sorrowful red. Facing these seven-foot-long fragrant branches, remembering the coral being shattered, the Jin Valley empty. The crimson trees convey songs, the cinnabar transforms bones, the cold beauty does not borrow the spring's labor. Do not ask about news from Yumen Pass, leaning on the remaining drunkenness, sleeves dancing in the west wind; wanting to write a secluded feeling to send far away, it's hard to fill the postbox.

A Tune of "Wind in the Pines" for Western Wine

The rich drops of pearl are concentrated in the small wine vat, autumn brewing with dewy fragrance; who passed on the brewing method from France? Reaching the vast sea, ten thousand miles of ladders and voyages. (Western wine from France is considered the best.) A single reed carries the precious vessel, a thousand flowers produce immortal nectar. The glass reflects the purple glow, a light buzz is already a delightful homecoming, rare flowers and precious fruits are searched and gathered, (this wine is made by mixing flowers and fruits) like bees diligently collecting honeyed pollen; willing to offer ten bushels of grapes, not envying the marquisate of the Western Liang.

### Two Brothers (Part 1)

— Linye

— A Popular Story from Annam

The pitch-black sky suddenly cracked open, and a snow-white ray of light pierced through it. Moving clouds slid past in front of the light, and gradually a round moon peeked out. ...

"What a beautiful moon!" Old Man Wen said with a sense of emotion, stroking his foot-long beard and straightening his chest as he looked up.

At that moment, a commotion of sounds came from not far away, mixed with the clatter of wooden boards: a group of children came up, all carrying many things: long benches, canvas folding stools, toys they couldn't bear to let go of.... Old Man Wen smiled and turned his face. Soon everyone had surrounded him.

The children clamored for Old Man Wen to tell a story. He also set a condition that everyone should sing a song first. After some back-and-forth, four or five of the more generous children clapped their hands and began to sing:

"The sun shines bright, on the earth, on the pond, on the thirtieth night of the year, picking betel nuts, betel nuts fragrant, picking purple ginger, purple ginger spicy, picking radishes, radishes sweet; alas, the radish harvest is not complete, half the fields have suffered disaster; I wonder when the war will end, and we can live in peace and enjoy the New Year? ..."

The singing stopped. Old Man Wen pondered for a moment, then slowly stood up from his chair and moved the stool slightly towards a large tree. A story had already formed in his head. In the past few days, he had been telling war stories, like the Three Kingdoms vying for dominance, and Yue Fei fighting the Jin soldiers. But today he wanted to change things up a bit. But no matter how he changed it, everyone was happy to listen.

——Long, long ago, there were two brothers who lived with their mother in a small seaside village in Fujian. Because they had no father, they relied solely on their two hands, using their labor to support their mother. The older brother was called Lao Da, and the younger brother was called Lao Er. Because they grew up in poverty, they developed a kind of filial piety. Lao Da had always been ambitious. He hoped that one day he could become a rich man and let his mother spend her old age in comfort....

Time passed quickly, and Lao Da had grown into a twenty-year-old youth. He had rosy skin, beautiful eyes, and hair, and he could sing beautiful mountain songs.... One day, he quietly discussed it with Lao Er. He hoped to go to a foreign land to do business with a seagoing ship, but Lao Er could only sympathize and could not help him.

Lao Da finally pleaded with his mother:

"Mom, let me go. At most half a year, and I'll bring back something you like...."

Lao Da finally packed his bags and prepared to board the ship. In his bundle were some clothes and dry provisions. His kind mother also gave him all her hard-earned savings over the years as travel expenses. On the morning of his departure, everyone cried and saw him off with tears. Lao Da carefully handed over the responsibility of caring for their old mother to the young Lao Er, and set off on the long journey with a heart full of hope.

After ten days at sea, Lao Da was finally brought to a land where he was unfamiliar with the people and the place—this was Annam. The lush green trees, the sweet tropical fruits, and the flat fields enchanted Lao Da. He thought that his hopes could be realized immediately.

### Recent World Literary Scene

— Zhao Jingshen

When Hitler was in power, no one would have thought that the old German literary giant Hauptmann would be accustomed to living under the Nazis. No one would have expected that Hauptmann would support Hitler's policies when he withdrew from the League of Nations. He spoke to Germans abroad in short broadcasts. No one would have thought that the person who challenged Kaiser in his youth would feel that this was the greatest period of his life when he shook hands with the Nazi Party.

Even conservatives attacked Hitler's anti-Semitism, but Hauptmann remained silent. In fact, with his status and age, he would not have been in mortal danger even if he had said a few words for the Jews. Did he forget that some Jewish actors, directors, and critics had helped him become "the German Ibsen" and "the German Shakespeare" in the realm of art? Hauptmann did not become a fascist like the Norwegian Nobel laureate Hamsun, but he did stain his life.

Waller Reichart, a German professor at the University of Michigan, recently wrote an introduction to Hauptmann's five-act play "The Obstacles" (Die Internisse). The script is written in German, but the introduction is written in English. He is an expert on Hauptmann and has tried his best to clear Hauptmann's name, but he cannot convince readers.

Wharton's Biography

Percy Lubbock has recently published "Portrait of Edith Wharton." This book is neither more nor less than the title indicates, and within its narrow limits, it is the most complete work of the last ten years. This is not a true biography, nor is it literary criticism. It is a portrait of a famous writer, a method commonly used in the eighteenth century that has reappeared today.

Lubbock says that Wharton was a sophisticated American who could see the struggle between materialism and idealism in the United States in the second half of the nineteenth century. She was also a highly skilled writer of her time, comparable to the female writer Caesar. She was greatly influenced by Henry James. Her standards are high, and she can capture countless readers of women's magazines.

He is a good friend of Wharton, and his success is that he wrote about her as a woman, not as a writer. The book also intersperses anecdotes about other friends and mentions that she built many houses and gardens in Lenot and northern France. She was a daughter of a wealthy family. When she was not writing, she grew flowers or talked. The flowers were grown for friends to see, and the words were shared with friends.

The book even writes about Wharton's habits of often being shy, shrugging her shoulders, and snoring. Lubbock is not very satisfied with Walter Berry, Wharton's lifelong lover. Berry is an American international lawyer.

The book records many of Wharton's conversations. Because she was talkative, she could talk about books, art, life, philosophy, etc., without any reservations.

### The Chinese and Books

— Zeshi

If the cultural level of a country can be measured by the number of books it publishes, then China, this ancient cultural nation, is in danger of being included in the list of the least cultural nations today. Generally speaking, the reason why Chinese people read so little is because of poverty and high illiteracy rates. This is naturally one explanation, but I secretly think that it is not entirely true. China has four or five hundred million people, and one in ten of them is comparable to the population of England. Is it possible that every Englishman is rich and highly educated, while one in ten Chinese is still penniless and illiterate? And the ratio of published books and the number of reading people in China and England is still far greater, without a doubt.

This is because Chinese people do not like to read, which is a sign of a lack of thirst for knowledge. Several months ago, I witnessed a debate between two friends, A and B, about whether buying books or buying white leather shoes was right or wrong. It turned out that on that day, friend A spent 80,000 yuan to buy an old Western book, while friend B spent 160,000 yuan to buy a new pair of white leather shoes. A said that the book was really cheap, but B scoffed at him, saying that it was really "suffering a wrongful death" to spend so much money on an old book. A retorted, saying that it was simply a waste to spend 160,000 yuan on a pair of white leather shoes. B said that shoes are a necessity, and books cannot satisfy hunger. A said that there is no need to distinguish between black and white for leather shoes, and that wearing leather shoes at all is foolish, as they are heavy to walk in and make a "gong, gong" sound, and if you live upstairs, you will definitely be hated by your downstairs neighbors. To want white ones and black ones is even more absurd, while books can increase knowledge, broaden horizons, borrow friends, pass on to descendants...

Although friend A likes to buy books, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, he buys three to five volumes every month, but he has never been poorly clothed or underfed because of it. His income is not more than friend B's, and his family burden is roughly the same. I once asked him where the money for buying books came from. He said, "It's very easy. There are expenses that are absolutely unavoidable in people's daily use of money, such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt. There are expenses that are absolutely avoidable, such as gambling and prostitution. There are expenses that can be avoided or not avoided, such as cigarettes and alcohol, such as rickshaws and cars, such as first-run movies and first-class barbershops, and even friend B's white leather shoes, which are too numerous to mention. My money for buying books comes from saving on items that can be avoided or not avoided. For example, if you smoke White Tip cigarettes, why not switch to Red Tip cigarettes, or switch to four times a month, saving some money to buy a book. If you ride a rickshaw, switch to a streetcar. If you are used to watching first-run movies, switch to watching last-run movies or not watching them several times, and so on. Such savings do not damage a hair, and the money for buying books is more than enough."

This makes a lot of sense. Persuading people to save on things that cannot be saved or reduce food that cannot be reduced to buy books may be forcing people to do something difficult and unreasonable, but not buying a pair of white leather shoes, which are only for temporary use, to buy books should be a matter of course and should not be criticized. But my friend B, who bought white leather shoes, is still a customer of the bookstore, because he certainly does not wear white leather shoes every day, and he has never failed to buy and read books. What is even more extreme is that I also know many people who are definitely not illiterate and have ample "disposable funds" to buy books, but they never buy a book all year round. Their rooms are full of refrigerators, electric fans, mahjong tiles, and poker cards, but not a single page of white paper printed with black words.

Therefore, we must investigate why books must be bought and read. The saying that there are golden houses and beautiful women in books is certainly a thing of the past and has become empty talk. Understanding what Plato said, what Marx said, whether American democracy is short, or Soviet democracy is long, practically speaking, what is the benefit after all? However, for Chinese people, the greatest benefit of reading is that only by reading can they clear the golden houses in their hearts and sweep away the beautiful women in their eyes. Because what many Chinese people today cherish and are influenced by is lottery tickets and women, their highest ideals are to live in a golden house with a beautiful woman, and to sleep in a coffin made of nanmu wood and have a state funeral after death. This is also a matter of human nature, and I dare not criticize it. The problem is that the world is not yet at the point where everyone has a machine—a machine for printing lottery tickets—so if everyone wants to live in a golden house with a beautiful woman and sleep in a coffin made of nanmu wood and have a state funeral, the result will inevitably be rampant desires, with people robbing each other and no longer having any moral principles. How to reverse this tide, I think reading more books is also a method. Books, except for prostitution manuals and gambling guides, are all talks about the past and present that do not involve one's own interests, such as how to build an ideal country, how Utopia succeeds, how commendable Washington's resignation is, how valuable Pasteur's research on rabies is, allowing you to read and think about things outside of yourself, even if you are still shocked by the soaring price of rice, you will still be affected by some subtle influences and will not, like those who do not read a book all year round and have not gone beyond their immediate interests, inevitably think only of money, money, money, and even be driven solely by profit. Because if we live in this world without borrowing a few things such as music, painting, sculpture, sports, books, sleep, etc., to allow us to transcend the material world and roam the void, then what we hear and see all day long will be nothing but dazzling material things, and how can we avoid being blinded by profit!

If someone says that if everyone reads books for the sake of fantasy as you said, wouldn't there be a risk of everyone becoming a "bookworm"? Then I would answer that if there were two countries in the world, one a bookworm country and the other a money-grubbing country, then I would sincerely be willing to renounce my citizenship in the money-grubbing country and become a citizen of the bookworm country.

### Five Jiao and Four Fen Per Grain of Rice

— Yang Wenyu

After the abolition of the lunar year, the price of rice first soared, breaking through the two million mark. According to a time-consuming statistical result from a relative of the author, calculated at two million yuan per dan, each grain of rice is already worth 5 jiao and 4 fen in legal currency. This is how he obtained the result: There are about 1,500 whole grains of white rice per liang, 15 jin and 7 liang of rice per dou, so there are 370,000 grains, and one dan of rice has 3.7 million grains. Therefore, when rice sells for 3.7 million yuan per dan, it is "one yuan per grain of rice." Buying rice will have to be calculated by the grain, and I'm afraid it will soon become a reality. At the same time, this relative tried it more than ten times, spitting out a mouthful of rice without chewing and counting it. He said that an adult's mouthful of rice has about 360 grains. Calculated at 5 jiao and 4 fen per grain of rice, it now costs about 140 yuan to eat a mouthful of rice. Comparing it to the situation ten years ago, one mouthful of rice now eats up two mu of farmland from the past.

### Eating (Part 2)

— Bai Yong

Although there are many kinds of ancient bronze artifacts discovered by archaeologists, the most important are the tableware, that is, among the ritual vessels, those belonging to ancestral temples or shrines are still related to eating. Soup plates and Kong tripods are all legacies left to us by our ancestors because of eating. By examining the living conditions of the ancients through this, what is regrettable is that we still cannot know in detail what the process and taste of the ancients' pickled vegetables and cooking were like. In the past, I often wondered why the ancients, when recording merits and rewarding achievements, did not issue medals or the like as we do today, but instead cast tripods and engraved inscriptions. Now that I think about it, I realize that the problem of eating is originally the most important thing in the world. This action of the ancients is probably more meaningful than medals. Not only that, but the ancients used the harmony of the cauldron to symbolize the prime minister's profession. A good cook is a good prime minister. Every knife and spoon, adding salt and soy sauce, is no different from the so-called adjustment and allocation in politics. National chaos is called "the cauldron boils," and national stability is called "peaceful feasting," which all seem to be related to eating. In fact, it is true that as long as the problem of eating is solved, there will be no chaos. Therefore, those who plan for the country say: "Everyone must have food to eat." - Those who say "Everyone has food to eat" are referring to revolution, with the ultimate goal being "Everyone has food to eat."

What is expressed externally is "negotiating at the banquet table," which may as well start with small things, such as the Shanghai wastrel's "drinking tea to settle disputes." The greatest hatred can be resolved in a cup of tea and a meal, or it can lead to a break after three cups of wine. Who can say that eating has nothing to do with peace? It is the same between people and between countries. If you have read Zuo Zhuan, you will definitely remember those fellows who were sent to the four directions, who, after a banquet, recited two lines of poetry, and could immediately establish a non-aggression treaty or a friendship agreement between the two countries. Fan Sui and Xu Jia became bitter enemies because of eating, which even affected the rise and fall of the country. Feng Xuan played the zither and sang songs, also first picking on the food. Su Qin stimulated Zhang Yi by having him eat with the servants. Zhuan Zhu assassinated King Liao by taking advantage of the opportunity of a banquet. As for situations like the Feast at Hong Gate and strategies like "releasing military power with a cup of wine," they are even more common in China. How many "throwing cups as a signal" and how many "ambushes of ax-wielding men on both sides" are there in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms? It can be seen that not only did Marquis of Huaiyin cherish the kindness of a meal, but the hatred of a meal is also not a trivial matter!

In folk customs, there is the eating of seasonal festivals. The object of Chinese festivals is often gods and Buddhas, and the enjoyment of festivals is eating. The old lunar year is currently being celebrated, which is the day of the great culmination of eating in the 360 days of the year. Yesterday, my child suddenly realized that "Isn't the reason why people celebrate festivals the day when pigs, chickens, ducks, and fish are unlucky?" Although childish, it is profoundly true. On New Year's Eve, meat has become expensive at 50,000 yuan per jin, but the vegetable market is still crowded! Demand exceeds supply, and foreign countries only eat a turkey for Christmas, and the whole country is ecstatic. How many kinds of food do we eat for the New Year? If we investigate and count them in all the provinces, cities, and counties of the country, we will definitely be able to write a book of several hundred pages. The Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival must be a big feast, which need not be discussed. Even small seasonal festivals, such as the Beginning of Spring, the Beginning of Winter, the Winter Solstice, the Summer Solstice, entering the Fu period, leaving the Fu period, the Lantern Festival, the Upper Lantern, the Lower Lantern, ... are all represented by eating. In eating, there must also be the meaning of getting rich. In the north, eating boiled dumplings during the New Year symbolizes ingots. In the south, the stove sugar is basically made in the shape of ingots, called ingot sugar. In peaceful times, we eat New Year's Eve dinner in the twelfth lunar month and spring wine in the first lunar month. The so-called "wheel meeting" in the north is even more lively, and there are many more auspicious words. Books that record customs, from Jingchu Sui Shi Ji to Tokyo Menghua Lu and Wulin Old Stories, all occupy a large amount of space on eating, which is rare in foreign countries.

Even stranger is the language. In the past, Mr. Liu Banchen wrote "Da Ya," specializing in the study of the use of the word "da," believing it to be the most difficult to understand and the most ambiguous in Chinese characters, jokingly calling it a "rogue word," because its explanation reached more than four hundred items. In fact, there are several words like this, and "chi" (eat) is probably the most common one: the use of "chi" in everyday language is endless. Special items such as "eat a defeat," "eat a living," "eat a loss," "eat a price," ... and there is also the saying of representing a certain occupation with "eat ×× rice," such as saying: eat self-government, eat charity, eat wastrel rice, which is even more wonderful and worth our "deep thought." I wonder if there is a scholar who will rise up and follow in the footsteps of Dr. Liu to write a "Chi Ya."

Recently, I saw many gentlemen and ladies on the train - especially the ladies, from the time the train started to the time they got off, eating fruits and snacks constantly, plus train meals, curry rice, and even meeting those selling buns, beef, and sesame cakes, they didn't let go. It is truly surprising how much they eat. Rich people in Guangdong can eat seven or eight meals a day, including snacks. For these people, their entire lives can probably be represented by eating. No wonder everyone always says "Have you had snacks?" "Have you had dinner?" when they meet. In the past, being scolded as a rice bucket would definitely lead to anger, but at the moment, wanting to genuinely be a rice bucket is not easy when the price of rice is over two million. However, wanting to be worthy of this scolding is exactly what they are looking for! On the other hand, the ancients often minced the other party and fried them in oil. Now that I think about it, is it also because of famine and food scarcity? When Huang Chao entered Chang'an, human flesh was valued by the pound, which is both terrible and pitiful. As for Ma Shumou's hobby of eating people, it is another matter, and in today's world, the so-called torrent of people is everywhere.

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Eleven: A Bellyful of Doubts, Seven Nine

Aunt Wang smiled and said, "Mr. Xu, go upstairs, I've already told the boss about last night. She's asking you to go up." As soon as Zhu Zhai heard Aunt Wang say this, he felt very excited. When he reached the top of the stairs, just as he lifted the curtain to enter Qi Huan's bedroom, he heard Qi Huan ask from inside, "Who is it? Is it Zhu Zhai? Please wait a moment." As soon as Zhu Zhai heard this, he immediately retracted his steps, turned around, and retreated to the outer living room. He couldn't help but feel a kind of embarrassing impression, because normally in Qi Huan's house, he would walk in and out without hindrance. No matter where Qi Huan was, they wouldn't stand on ceremony with each other and could walk in at will. Today, she was in the bedroom and actually stopped him from entering. Normally she would just call him "Zhu! Zhu!" but today she called him Zhu Zhai. Such a way of addressing him, such an action, clearly showed distance. He withdrew from the bedroom, feeling very sad in his heart. With all the impressions he had gained today, in a fit of anger, he really wanted to go back and ignore her. In the living room, with his hands in his trouser pockets, he paced around the table, his heart full of anger and resentment. He walked around several circles before Aunt Wang pushed the door open and came in, smiling and saying, "The boss is asking for you." Zhu Zhai, filled with anger, asked Aunt Wang, "Don't walk to the door again and chase me out." Aunt Wang laughed and said, "What are you angry about, my dear sir! People are waiting for you! Go quickly, and be a little nicer when you see her. I've already told her how you went out to look for her last night. She even shed tears when she heard it!" As soon as Zhu Zhai heard that Qi Huan had shed tears, all the anger and resentment in his heart disappeared. He said, "I'm not angry," and followed Aunt Wang straight to Qi Huan's bedroom. He saw her lying on the bed, facing inward, covered with a red satin quilt. Zhu Zhai, following his usual habit, sat down on the edge of the bed and placed one hand on the quilt, asking, "Were you tired last night? Are you feeling unwell?" These two sentences were originally just a casual inquiry from Zhu Zhai, but Qi Huan found them very刺耳, as if Zhu Qi was mocking her. When she heard what Aunt Wang had told her, she felt very sad in her heart. All kinds of feelings made her shed tears involuntarily. Now, unintentionally, Zhu Zhai asked her, "Were you tired last night?" She immediately felt that men's hearts were cruel and could say anything. She coldly replied, "Not tired!" Zhu Zhai asked again, "Where did you go last night? I didn't come back all night, I was really worried." Qi Huan replied coldly again, "I'm not a child, what's there to be afraid of!" Zhu Zhai was stunned by the two snubs.

### The Definition of a Child

— Ruyi

What is a child? A child is a bank in which you can store your most precious treasures—such as: your hard-earned wisdom, your dreams of making the world a better place. Your children will preserve these treasures, and they may even make good use of these treasures and receive considerable interest.

How well you have done your work will be judged by today's children. Tomorrow, he will replace you. The "future" belongs to children, and if you can pay more attention to him today, then the "future" may still have a place for you to stand.

### Commercial Ethics

— Sent from the Desert

In a certain English publication published in this city, I read an unsigned article by a certain gentleman, which was quite critical of international trade since the victory. This article also cited several "interesting" examples.

In June 1946, someone ordered 11,064 pairs of men's and women's leather shoes from a store in New York, worth US$52,500. The goods arrived in Shanghai in batches between July and August of the same year. The sizes, styles, and colors were all inconsistent with those specified in the samples and orders, and some of the leather shoes even had "samples" from more than a decade ago mixed in. What was even more frustrating after an investigation of this transaction was that the New York exporter had just been released from a reformatory!

Similar to the above incident, there was also an order for 10,000 black melton overcoat fabrics worth US$70,000, and 6,000 yards of tweed worth US$40,000. Initially, the importer specified only twelve types of tweed patterns. However, after the goods arrived in Shanghai and were opened, there were actually one hundred and ninety different colors and patterns. The situation with the melton overcoat fabrics was even worse, with some being serge, some being thick wool, and some being camel hair. It is said that this was a batch of odds and ends of wool fabrics, but they were all dyed black.

Another example is that someone ordered 15,000 fluorescent lamps from a New York exporter in April 1946. The goods arrived in full within three months, but the materials were of poor quality, the manufacturing was shoddy, and they were unusable. The final result of sending them to the power company for inspection was that they were not only considered waste but also posed a great danger when used.

In addition, a local merchant who ordered woolen hats and woolen underwear from a New York exporter also complained incessantly. It turned out that the brims of the imported woolen hats were too narrow to be suitable for the market, and the sizes were either too large or too small. Although the woolen underwear was made entirely of wool, it was old clothing that had been worn once or several times.

A relatively mild situation was that a certain merchant ordered a batch of "Santa Knight" mandarin oranges from San Francisco, which were indeed produced in California, but they were much smaller than those sold on the market, so they had to be sold at a reduced price.

Here, we can regard these things as "anecdotes" in the history of international trade. However, there are countless acts that disregard commercial ethics. For example, a whole box of soap will be short one or two bars, the bottom of a tin of biscuits is actually a large wad of paper and biscuit crumbs, assorted candies have a bitter taste, and "high-quality" silk stockings tear into a hole after being worn for a day. Originally, industry and commerce aim to make profits, which is understandable, but we believe that both Chinese and foreign merchants should at least strive for "genuine goods at fair prices"!

### Radar

— Mei Bai

According to recent test results, magnesium flash bulbs used for photography within a radius of approximately 250 feet around radar may explode due to the influence of the radar, or even catch fire. Therefore, American aircraft equipped with radar are no longer allowed to carry such light bulbs.

### Remembering the Puppet Emperor Because of the Fire at the False "Palace"

— Lei Yuan

Upon seeing the news from Changchun, it was reported that more than a hundred buildings of the former Puppet Manchu Palace, which were converted into a school after the restoration, were destroyed by a fire, reduced to ashes. The traces of a puppet regime have vanished without a trace.

In the summer of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, Puyi was still living in the Forbidden City in Beiping. One night, a sudden fire broke out in the palace, shocking the city. The fire was finally extinguished, but the losses were enormous. In my work "Twelve Verses of Summer Awakening in Guihai" (published in the Beijing News and the Shanghai Times), the fifth verse is about this event: "Living at home, breaking through the heavens, what an unexpected end. For ten years, Shenzhou watched with folded hands. Flaming torches soar into the sky, startling ten thousand households. Officials gather in the Forbidden City in the deep of night. Where is the spirit of the White Mountains and Black Water? The traces of the stopped magpie and rising dragon are already gone. Reviving the country and setting fire to the plains are the same instrument, so hold back your tears and don't shed them lightly." Many people responded in verse, and Gu Youyi of Taizhou wrote: "Who knows that a single torch is not a blessing, and a ten-year plan is an abandoned ruin!" He advocated optimism for the emperor, with a novel idea and an alert expression, which was indeed reasonable.

Puyi ascended the throne at the age of three and abdicated at the age of six, without enjoying the blessing of "Ninth Five". He never held the power of a true monarch, living in seclusion in the deep palace, surrounded by eunuchs, palace concubines, and Qing loyalists. His situation became increasingly difficult, but he still had to maintain the pomp of an emperor. Although there were many supporters, they were all looking at the imperial property in the palace. In addition to "rewards" and "salaries" that benefited those above and below, if they were not satisfied, they would secretly steal and replace things. They knew that this young emperor's authority did not extend beyond the palace, and the eunuchs and others became even more unscrupulous. It is said that the disaster of Guihai was caused by too much theft, which could not be concealed, so they set a fire to quickly destroy the traces. The corruption and depravity of the situation were indescribable. Puyi received the worship of a group of extremely bored people and had to use his ancestral property to support them month after month. The puppet career was not much different from the puppet emperor of "Manchukuo." However, he himself was in his youth and had a foreign doctor teach him, so he was approaching modern thought. If he could use this fire to awaken from his delusions, break free from his noble cage, and transform into a new life, it would not be a lost opportunity, as the saying goes, "A loss may turn out to be a blessing in disguise." Mr. Gu's poetic intent was truly one of cold observation and a warm heart, deeply considering the future for this "child emperor."

However, he was ultimately just a "child," a weakling being manipulated, without decision-making power or freedom. In the winter of the following year (the thirteenth year of the Republic of China), Feng Yuxiang revolted against "Cao" (Kun) and顺加演"forced the abdication", driving Puyi and the old imperial family out of the Forbidden City and turning them into relatively ordinary residents in Tianjin. Some people advised him to study abroad, completely free himself from the old shackles, and strive to become a practical and capable young man, representing his clan and serving China, which was another good opportunity.

However, a group of corrupt and inferior "subjects" did not let go, and the Japanese "looked at the grass and saw the hawk's eyes were sharp", seeing him as a "rare commodity" and protecting him in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin, calling it the "imperial court." Japanese officials and businessmen treated him with the courtesy of a monarch, and the Qing loyalists continued to pay respects and submit memorials according to the old rituals, deceiving themselves and others, and claiming to be alone and orphaned. This went on for eight years, missing all opportunities for studying abroad and starting a new life. When the "September 18th Incident" occurred, Doihara rushed to Tianjin, coaxing and threatening him, first moving him to Dalian and then to Changchun. He first taught him to be the "Chief Executive" and then promoted him to be the "Emperor", with the reign titles first "Datong" and then "Kangde", changing morning and evening, neither fish nor fowl. Furthermore, he was not allowed to resume the name "Great Qing" nor to return to the old capital of three hundred years ago (Fengtian), but was designated to Changchun and made a puppet for fourteen years, neither crying nor laughing, being "pulled by strings" and "making clothes for others." It is fitting that after the victory, when Puyi was escorted to Tokyo, Japan to testify against Japanese criminals, he recounted the experience, angrily shouting and even pounding the table. When the "bandit" (i.e., "Doihara") was about to flee, Puyi's entourage negotiated with him, and there were considerable conditions. The "bandit" readily agreed, but when they arrived in Dalian and entered their sphere of influence, the situation changed. Puyi had a sense of this and hesitated to proceed, lingering for several months, but ultimately could not resist the coercion and followed him east. In the beginning of the establishment of the puppet organization, there was still some semblance of dignity, but soon the ruse was exposed, and everything was controlled by the Japanese. The ministries had Japanese "Vice Ministers" but the "Ministers" were mere companions, and the courts had Japanese "Chief Secretaries" while the "Premiers" simply nodded in agreement. Puyi was not allowed to interfere in political affairs, and even the "palace" was gradually interfered with. He had no freedom in personnel and expenses.

Puyi claimed to be the "Chief Executive", imitating Duan Qirui of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China. His advancement to emperor and the establishment of the reign title "Kangde" alluded to "Kangxi" of the early Qing dynasty, and he modeled himself after Yuan Shikai of the fifth year of the Republic of China, using "Hongxian" to allude to "Hongwu" of the early Ming dynasty. Furthermore, the former Qing dynasty and Japan had a "cabinet" under the emperor, but the puppet "Manchukuo" could only be called the "Prime Minister of the State Council". Also, both Japan and the former Qing dynasty had a so-called "responsible cabinet", where the monarch was not responsible for political affairs, but in puppet "Manchukuo", not only did the puppet emperor have no power, but even the puppet prime minister (first Zheng Xiaoxu and then Zhang Jinghui) held a nominal position, while everything was directed by the Japanese in the General Affairs Office. Thus, a "office system" was created outside the "cabinet system", which was unheard of in the world and truly a joke.

After Puyi was a puppet for fourteen years, for the last three years, he was a prisoner of war. The glory of the past puppet was still considered the old home of the White Mountains and Black Water, but the life of a prisoner of war was spent wandering in Soviet territory, with no relatives to turn to. When reading history, we see the suffering of Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of the Song Dynasty being captured by the Jin, detained in the Five Kingdoms City, and at the end of the Jin dynasty, the Jin emperor was forced by the Mongols to flee to Caizhou, arriving at Shuanggu Temple, with wormwood everywhere. Their concubines were escorted to Helin, and the historical record states, "The journey was full of hardships, even worse than the time of Huizong and Qinzong." Therefore, the situation of Puyi from Changchun to Vladivostok to Moscow can be imagined. He never enjoyed a day of real power and tasted the suffering of a monarch of a fallen country, because he had never escaped the nature of being a "rare commodity" from the beginning. He was misled by corrupt officials and harmed by the Japanese, losing the opportunity for freedom twice in twenty years. It was his fate!

### Tuition and Fees· Heavy Burden, Sell Old Books· Seek Compensation

Editor: Current prices are soaring, and I am deeply worried about the various expenses for the next semester. Therefore, I would like to transfer more than 30 copies of my university business courses for the first and second years and high school textbooks to others to compensate for the expenses. Those who are willing (regardless of the number) can send a letter with postage to No. 297 Fanwangdu Road, and I will send the catalog. I would be grateful if you could borrow a corner of your newspaper! Respectfully submitted by student Chen Zhongming
