### General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to Take Effect for China on the 22nd; President Truman Formally Issues Proclamation

[United States Information Service, Washington, 4th] President Truman today issued a proclamation announcing that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will take effect for China on May 22, 1948. The United States signed the agreement with 22 other countries in Geneva last October 20. The President took this action after learning that the Chinese government had signed the Provisional Application Draft of the General Agreement on April 21, 1948. According to the provisions of the draft, China will make the agreement effective 30 days after the date of signature. China is the eleventh country to make the agreement effective and the first country in the Far East to do so. In addition to the United States, other countries that have made the agreement effective include: United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Canada, Australia, Cuba, and Czechoslovakia. Under the General Agreement, China makes concessions on goods needed by the United States, amounting to approximately US$52 million in 1939 trade. Existing import duties on many items, such as office machinery, lightweight vehicles, lathes, canned milk, lubricating oils and greases, tires, and vacuum tubes, have been reduced. For a wide range of other items, where current tax rates are largely considered generally low, these tax rates will be maintained. These materials include those related to the United States, such as cotton, tobacco, wheat, flour, certain dried fruits, radios, motor vehicles and lathes other than lightweight ones, agricultural machinery, pumps, refrigerators, machine tools, certain foods, and special dyes. China and the other signatory countries to the agreement are subject to certain restrictions on the application for foreign exchange, withdrawal restrictions, foreign exchange controls, customs valuation, and the conduct of state-run trade. These provisions are very important because they require China and the other signatory countries to give fair treatment to trade with the United States. The United States' concessions on exports to China in the General Agreement apply to goods with a standard value of nearly US$62.3 million in 1939. Of this trade, US$37.8 million worth of products are listed on the current US duty-free list. Items in which the United States has agreed to reduce tariffs and which are of major interest to China include bristles, tungsten, frozen dried eggs, walnuts, hat braids, total flower and lace clothing, embroidered handkerchiefs, and certain oils. Tung oil, raw silk, and certain types of fur and hides can still be imported duty-free. The current tax rate on pig bristles is guaranteed not to increase. These concessions must be granted after the most careful consideration and public presentation of opinions by the various government agencies involved in the negotiations, in order to ensure that domestic producers are not seriously harmed by these concessions. However, any of these concessions may be withdrawn or modified to such an extent as to prevent or remedy such losses if, due to unforeseen circumstances, imports from China increase to such an extent that they cause serious damage to domestic producers or create such a threat. This provision thus provides protection for the interests of domestic producers.

### Wu Tiecheng Discusses Democracy; Believes Success or Failure Hinges on the People; Urgently Hopes that Kuomintang Members Will Unite and Be Progressive

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, spoke on the 5th about his expectations for establishing a democratic style and the Kuomintang members exerting their united strength. He first pointed out that if any democratic country in the world wants to promote democratic politics universally and deeply and achieve brilliant achievements, it must not only abide by the law but also strive to cultivate good political habits. Because the success or failure of democratic politics is the government's inherent responsibility, but the people's attitude is also the most critical. Only when every citizen can care about politics, understand politics, distinguish between right and wrong, and distinguish between right and wrong can the politics of the people, by the people, and for the people be achieved. Politicians in advanced countries are all working hard to create good political habits, which become a kind of unwritten law and have a permanent exemplary effect, the effect of which is even greater than written law. The democratic style of Britain and the United States is built on this unbreakable foundation. The recent presidential and vice-presidential elections can be called a good model. The winner is not arrogant, and the loser is content. There is not only no slightest discord between the two, but they also congratulate and comfort each other. This style is truly precious. Wu also said: In a democratic country, politics cannot be exercised without political parties, which is a common understanding among those in the know. However, whether political parties can be good at exercising politics depends on whether they themselves have policies that are appropriate to the needs of the times and strong solidarity. If a political party can unite the entire party into one and exert its entire strength to promote its policy of seeking welfare for the people and progress for the country, it can naturally gain the people's confidence and shoulder the country's heavy responsibility. Wu said in conclusion: Therefore, I earnestly hope that all members of the party will understand that the party still bears the greatest responsibility in the politics after the implementation of the constitution. If we want to achieve this sacred task, we must concentrate our efforts, urgently reform, concentrate our will, strictly organize, and go to a common goal. Wu finally emphasized: During this period of suppressing the rebellion, there are many difficulties. Whether we can overcome them depends on whether the party can exert its entire strength and the comrades can serve the country. This is the time. If we can sacrifice the small to complete the great self, then although the situation is difficult and the responsibility is heavy, I firmly believe that we will be able to complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.

[Another Dispatch] Yesterday's report that Wu Tiecheng would be transferred to be the chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government after the implementation of the constitution is said to be untrue by those close to Wu.

Secondly, someone pointed out that the First Provisional National Assembly would be held half a year after the case year, and our constitutional amendment must be discussed and drafted in advance. Therefore, we must first formulate a work outline and work schedule, so as to collect various data and draft proposals within a limited time. After discussion, it was decided to submit it to the Standing Committee for discussion. Also, those who attended the meeting were very familiar with the promotion of association affairs.

### Bullitt Pays Homage to the Chairman; Will Return to Shanghai in Six or Seven Days to Inspect Taiwan, Guangzhou, and Other Places; Will Report What He Sees and Hears to Congress

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] Bullitt arrived in Nanjing at 7 AM on the 5th, taking the night train from Shanghai. Chairman Chiang's representative You Jianwen, Mayor Shen's representative Bao Zichen, Foreign Minister Wang's representative Wei Xuezhi, as well as Minister of Propaganda Li Weiguo, Director-General of the Lizi Society Huang Renlin, and US Military Advisors, including Lieutenant General Badowin and Group Leader Major General Keikul, all went to the station to greet him in their private capacities. After getting off the train, Bullitt said to those who welcomed him: "The sleeper cars on the Jinghu Railway are truly the first-class sleeper cars in the world." He had a comfortable sleep all night. Bullitt also told reporters that he had not received any government assignment this time and that it was purely a private visit. He replied to the question of how he could benefit China: "I will visit China's friendly and responsible officials and travel to various places to report all the facts I hear and see to Congress, so that it will believe that China needs and should receive American aid." To show that his trip was a private visit, Bullitt abandoned the Song Ziwen residence prepared for him by the Chinese government and stayed at Major General Keith's residence. Keith, who is a good friend of his, had already prepared a place for him to stay. After exchanging greetings with the greeters at the station, Bullitt returned to his residence with Keith to rest. He visited Ambassador Stuart in the morning and talked for two hours. He also paid homage to Chairman Chiang in the afternoon. He was invited to dinner by President Hu Shi in the evening.

### Legislative Yuan May Convene on the 8th; Method of Handling Disputes Over Unsuccessful Candidates for Legislative Yuan; Chairman Sincerely Explains to the Democratic Socialist Party

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] Chairman Chiang summoned Xu Fulin, Ji Yiqiao, and Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party at 10 AM on the morning of the 5th to explain the issue of the elected legislators. Xu did not go due to a cold, and Ji and Jiang went accompanied by Lei Zhen. The Chairman first explained to them the method of handling election disputes and said that it was possible to remedy the unsuccessful candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party. Ji and others replied that they would report back to the party leaders and then left. The key members of the Democratic Socialist Party have all taken planes and trains to Shanghai in the afternoon and evening of the 5th to attend the Central Committee meeting on the 6th and discuss the current issues. Also, when Chairman Chiang spoke with them, he earnestly expressed his hope that the two parties would continue to cooperate with the Kuomintang to the end as they originally intended. However, according to the Democratic Socialist Party, this point is worth considering. Under these circumstances, the Legislative Yuan will not be able to participate, and the government does not want to participate either. It is also learned that the Youth Party is also dissatisfied with this attitude, and the key members of the party have also gone to Shanghai separately to convene the Central Committee meeting to discuss and decide on the party's policies.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] On the second day that the preparatory committee for the new Legislative Yuan convened to register, the legislators gradually became more enthusiastic.

Editorial

### On the Exchange of Notes Between China and the U.S. and the Use of U.S. Aid

Following the passage of the U.S. Aid to China Act by Congress on April 2nd, it was signed by President Truman and handed to the State Department for implementation. The total amount of aid to China is $463 million. Out of that amount, $125 million is specifically earmarked for military use, while the remaining $338 million is for economic assistance. Therefore, how will this U.S. aid be used? What specific materials will it include? And how will it be allocated? These questions have long been a matter of concern for both the government and the public in China and the United States. On April 30th, our ambassador to the United States, Dr. V.K. Wellington Koo, and U.S. Secretary of State Marshall exchanged documents. The contents of the exchange were published on the 3rd of this month, stating that all procedures are pending the establishment of a bilateral agreement. The Executive Yuan of our country also decided at its meeting on the 4th to establish a U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, responsible for proper management and utilization. However, before the signing of the bilateral agreement, up until July 3rd of this year, the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement signed on October 27th of last year will still be followed. This indicates that this U.S. aid can now be partially implemented, with the type and method of implementation being exactly the same as the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement. Although the amount of assistance is not explicitly specified, according to the provisions of Section 406 of the original bill, it will not exceed the $50 million advanced by the Finance and Rehabilitation Bureau.

According to the various provisions of the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement, the main points are: (1) The United States will supply certain basic necessities, namely food, medicine, ready-made and unfinished clothing, fertilizers, insecticides, fuel, and seeds. (2) In addition to free distribution, the above materials should be properly allocated together with similar items produced or imported by China, to ensure that people of all social strata receive a fair and equal share. (4) Efforts should be made to implement a rationing system and price control system in major cities. (5) The funds from the sale of materials, except for agreed-upon uses, should be used for relief and work relief projects in China, and it is stated that this plan should be jointly determined by designated personnel from China and representatives from the United States, in order to ensure rapid and appropriate use. According to this precedent, it can be proven that the currently available U.S. aid simultaneously has two meanings: one is economic, namely suppressing prices, and the other is for relief, namely supplying materials.

The so-called suppression of prices refers to the price control system required to be implemented in the agreement, the method of which is to implement rationing, the source of which is the same materials provided by both countries. This is currently being gradually implemented in the five major cities. It was originally scheduled to run for four months, ending at the end of June. Now that the initial method of U.S. aid has been decided to follow this model, it is no different from an extension of the Relief Agreement, and this rationing system can naturally be smoothly extended again.

The Sino-U.S. Agreement originally stipulated that the funds from the relief goods would be used to support China's improvement of consumption and price controls. It also included a condition requiring our country to provide the same materials produced locally or imported from abroad to cooperate and expand the effect. This illustrates that to truly improve consumption and control prices, relying solely on U.S. relief materials is not enough. Therefore, we must also mention whether the basic necessities produced, purchased, ordered, and received by the government can be allocated or sold at a subsidized price according to this example, in order to respond to the foreign desire to improve consumption and control prices. Since the War of Resistance, suppressing prices has been a consistent policy of the government. To date, the various measures taken in finance, trade, loans, foreign exchange, and domestic exchange all seem to be heading in this direction. In recent days, a new wave of price increases has been stirring again. If price controls are limited to foreign relief materials, while excluding the materials that we already hold or can control as much as possible, insisting on selling only at the highest price or market price, or even holding onto them without releasing them, waiting for an even higher price in the future, I wonder if this is in line with the government's policy of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods?

As for relief, the Sino-U.S. Agreement stipulates that the funds from the sale of materials are to be used for relief and work relief. The period for implementing rationing is already halfway over, and there are so many refugees in various places, and the disaster areas affected by war are so vast. I wonder if the relief and work relief plans that our country should provide have been drafted? What exactly is its content? This is what the disaster areas, the refugees, and the local authorities where refugees are concentrated are anxiously awaiting every day. Now that the first step of U.S. aid is being handled in accordance with the Sino-U.S. Agreement, the proceeds from the sale of materials, as well as the various relief materials that are not sold but directly provided free of charge, can be planned as a whole, expanding the scope, and quickly finding a practical and effective way out for refugees in various places. In our opinion, whether it is passive relief or active assistance, all measures should primarily be directly related to the lives of the refugees.

In addition to food, cotton, fuel, and medicine, relief materials originally included fertilizers, seeds, and insecticides. If work relief is limited in scope and cannot accommodate as much as possible, it may be possible to select more land plots and encourage reclamation in order to return to agriculture. Currently, there is abandoned land in all provinces, and the lack of strong laborers and the abandonment of fields are a concern. It is not necessary to insist that only Sanmen Bay is an ideal place for reclamation. What is worrying is that no one is responsible, and excuses are made, then who would be willing to eagerly respond to the call and find trouble for themselves? Therefore, it is alright if we do not want to solve this serious problem for the refugees, but if we really want to solve this serious problem, then the central competent departments should grasp the key points and take on this matter.

### The Collection of Estimated Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax in Various Regions is Extremely Smooth; Ministry of Finance Denies Rumors of Changing from Six Times to Four Times, etc.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance stated: The collection of estimated profit-seeking enterprise income tax in various regions is proceeding extremely smoothly. Currently, most commercial establishments in Tianjin, Taiyuan, Baotou, Xi'an, Baoji, Jinjiang, Longyan Fuliang, Guilin, Jiaxing, Wuhu, Hengyang, Bengbu, Changde, Linyu, Changchun, Kunming, Xiamen, Hanjiang, Shaoyang, Dangtu, Datong, Xuanzhou, Guixian, Jiuquan, Nanjing, Wuxi, Wuxian, Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, Songjiang, Nantong, Changzhou, Jiangdu, Linhai, Xining, Longxi, Hefei, Sazhou, and other places have paid their taxes on time. In Shanghai, the number of commercial establishments that have paid their taxes has also reached over 10,000 units. Regarding public enterprises, the Ministry has also sent letters to the relevant authorities instructing them to pay on time, otherwise they will be sent to court for punishment according to law, without any leniency. Although some chambers of commerce have requested a reduction in the estimated multiple, they were sternly rejected because it concerns the fiscal budget and legitimate national taxes. Recently, there have been rumors outside that the Ministry has approved the requests of various chambers of commerce, changing the estimated tax from six times to four times, etc., all of which are unfounded and have ulterior motives. It is hoped that commercial establishments in various industries will not be fooled and must comply with the regulations and pay on time without further delay to avoid being subject to penalties.

### Deadline for Applications for Compensation for Materials Robbed by the Japanese

The above instructions were recently issued. The policy of the Far Eastern Commission on looted property has not yet been decided. According to Wu Bannong, chairman of the Compensation and Return Committee of our delegation in Japan, Chinese citizens must pay attention to the above deadline. He pointed out that the amount of property looted by Japan from our side during the war was enormous, but the number of applicants to date is less than expected. Wu urged Chinese citizens to submit their applications as soon as possible and emphasized that supporting documents or vouchers must be attached to the application.

### The Kremlin Does Not Abandon Communist Ideas, Britain Will Never Compromise With the Soviet Union, Bevin Reports on the Diplomatic Situation to the House of Commons

[Reuters, London, 4th] At the beginning of the two-day foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons, opposition spokesman Butler severely criticized the expansion of Soviet imperialism, pointing out that it has created dangerous points in Palestine, India, the Far East, and Southeast Asia, especially in China. Butler solemnly warned that decisive and visionary action should be taken not only in the West but also in Central and Far East. Butler stated, "The Soviet people have a global communist rule policy, which will inevitably exert pressure on any place in the world."

Earlier, when Foreign Secretary Bevin opened the debate, he spoke of international general relations, saying, "We have always felt that if we only had to deal with the Soviet Union without involving communism, then a solution would be possible. The factor hindering the agreement is that any solution that we engage in will be used to promote the goals of communism. Until the Kremlin changes its 'ideological attitude,' there will be few opportunities for truly lasting solutions between Britain and the Soviet Union."

Regarding the situation in Palestine, he said, "We have not abandoned our original resolution to end the mandate on May 15. We have accepted the responsibility to maintain law and order in that place before that day and to prevent aggression. We are willing to use military force to achieve this goal and to cover the withdrawal of our troops after May 15. We have used all our strength to stop the Arab countries from invading Palestine. Our attitude is to warn both sides that during the period when Britain maintains its mandate until May 15, we will never tolerate any form of intrusion. However, after May 15, we will never act against the will of any party or use our force to implement any solution. The urgent task now is that the shooting must stop immediately, and an institution must be established to allow wise opinions to exist. At this last moment, I still urge those seeking a solution not to give up their efforts. There is still time to use reason, but a few more days of turmoil will be too late."

### Western European Alliance Seeks Self-Defense, Hopes Germany Can Achieve Reunification

Speaking of the Western European Alliance, Bevin emphasized that since his last speech on the Western European Alliance, steady, useful, and systematic progress has been made in realizing the goals he set at that time, which has made Western European countries affirmatively become a true part of Europe. The five signatory countries have all sacrificed narrow national interests, sometimes even fairly significant interests, to seek the common welfare of Europe, and have not deviated from the great and practical task that has already begun due to the concept of sovereignty. The five countries unanimously want to make the Western European Alliance Convention an effective tool for cooperation in every aspect, and believe that a solid foundation has been obtained at the beginning.

Bevin continued, "Regarding military issues, we have now reached the stage of joint review. In terms of defense, we have no intention of aggression against others. The security of the Western European Alliance countries should be the urgent task of responsible politicians and parliaments. This move will not lead to war. On the contrary, the division of Western countries and allowing them to continue to exist will inevitably leave Western European countries unable to defend themselves. Our freedom and survival, as well as the maintenance of Western European countries' position in the world, must be the goals of continued organization and attention. We still hope that other countries can participate in the Western European Alliance and cooperate with each other on absolutely equal terms."

Bevin then spoke of the recent dispute between Western countries and the Soviet Union in Berlin, strongly stating, "Our presence in Berlin is where our rights lie. We are determined to continue staying in Berlin. I believe that the attempt to solve this problem with a war of nerves will eventually end, and it can be replaced by open and honest negotiations. We still advocate the principle of German unification, but we also have to face the fact that there is currently no possibility of achieving the goal of a unified Germany. However, we have not given up hope for the future, and we will do our best to restore a reasonable and healthy standard of living for Germany, including economic and political life. The disunity of Germany hinders the development of its own country and its neighbors."

Regarding the Italian issue, Bevin acknowledged that there are still many obstacles to be overcome before the tasks Italy will undertake after the war can be clarified. Britain believes that Trieste should be returned to Italy. If that place can be returned to the Italian people living there, it is believed that there can be fair borders sufficient to establish peace and stability."

Bevin concluded, "Symbolically speaking at present, a good harvest is expected around the world this year. If so, the increase in food supply may not be a help to restoring world peace and normal conditions. It is hoped that world prices can generally fall, so that the European Recovery Program can fully exert its effectiveness. However, American aid cannot allow us to relax our efforts in any aspect. No matter what diplomatic achievements there are, factories, farms, and mines can make equal contributions to world peace, so production efforts should not be relaxed in the slightest."

### European Federal Conference to Be Held in The Hague Tomorrow

[Reuters, London, 4th] More than 700 representatives from 16 Western European countries will meet in The Hague on Friday to discuss the issue of organizing the United States of Europe.

Other long-term proposals include establishing a common European citizenship, establishing a European defense force, and a unified economic system. The ultimate goal is to establish the United States of Europe.

### U.S. Congressmen Suggest Reorganizing UN Agencies, House Foreign Affairs Committee Listens to Marshall's Opinions

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee began discussing the issue of reorganizing UN agencies. Marshall attended and stated his opinions, opposing any plan to reorganize the UN without the consent of the Soviet Union. Marshall stated, "We must convince the Soviet leaders that the Soviet Union can indeed 'live peacefully' with other countries. If we hastily reorganize the UN without the Soviet Union's consent, this institution will be destroyed and form an opposing military alliance. What we need now is not a new peace institution, but to make better use of the institutions that already exist."

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today listened for the first time to the opinions of several Congressmen who advocate amending the UN Charter. About 30 Senators and Representatives have already proposed resolutions suggesting that the veto power should not be used on issues such as aggression, armed preparation for aggression, inspection and control of atomic and other weapons, and the establishment of an international security force. Democratic Representative Hayes and Republican Representative Javits came to the Foreign Affairs Committee today to express their opinions, advocating that the United States lead the amendment of the Charter. If the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate, it may cooperate with it. If the Soviet Union refuses to cooperate, there is no need to wait for its cooperation. Hayes strongly stated that these steps are not anti-Soviet, but are moving towards peace. Javits believes that if the United States and other countries in the world can show the Soviet Union that Soviet cooperation is not necessary, he believes that the Soviet Union will soon be able to automatically compromise.

### The Four Powers Will Hold a Meeting in Nanjing to Discuss the Danube River Issue, Austria Will Attend as an Observer

[Reuters, London, 5th] It was announced here today that the four powers of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France have agreed to hold a four-power conference in Belgrade this month to discuss the issue of controlling international shipping rights on the Danube River. The representatives attending the meeting will be high-level officials, and the agenda will include the entire Danube River issue after the war. Representatives from Austria and Yugoslavia will attend as observers. Historically, the Danube River issue has been one of the most thorny issues in Europe. The Soviet Union firmly believes that the international freedom of navigation on the Danube River cannot coexist with the modern concept of sovereignty. Western countries strongly advocate restoring the pre-war international freedom of navigation status.

It is generally believed that the four powers holding a meeting in Belgrade to discuss this matter is a sign of concession from Western countries. Western countries have probably recognized that fully allowing freedom of navigation on the Danube River is not permitted by the current situation. If the Soviet Union can also make some concessions, then the thorny Danube River issue will not be difficult to resolve.

[Reuters, London, 5th] According to the decision of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the international conference on the future control of the Danube River should be convened six months after the Hungarian-Romanian-Bulgarian peace treaties come into effect, that is, on May 15. At that time, the Foreign Ministers' Conference decided not to stipulate the Danube River issue in the peace treaties, but to leave it to the international conference to be discussed six months after the peace treaties came into effect. In mid-March of this year, the United States suggested postponing this meeting until the end of this year. Britain has also agreed, but Britain has now accepted Moscow's suggestion to convene the Belgrade Conference in the near future. However, Britain also suggested holding preliminary discussions in Washington first to determine the procedures for the Belgrade Conference. The Soviet Union has not yet expressed its opinion on this proposal. The resolution of the 1946 Foreign Ministers' Conference stipulated that the Belgrade Conference should be held by the countries of the Danube River Basin, namely the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, together with the other three powers of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, namely Britain, the United States, and France. The Foreign Ministers' Conference also decided that if the Austrian treaty had been concluded at that time, Austria should be allowed to attend as an observer.

### Hodge Explicitly Rejects North Korea's Demand for Troop Withdrawal Unless an Independent Government Is Established in Korea

[Associated Press, Seoul, 5th] Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the U.S. occupation forces in Korea, explicitly rejected on the 5th the communist demand for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea. This request was made by the North-South Korean political conference initiated by the Soviet Union, which was recently held in Pyongyang, the capital of the Soviet-occupied area. The conference demanded that U.S. and Soviet troops withdraw from Korea at the same time, and sent telegrams to Washington and Moscow calling for withdrawal.

### Drafting a Plan for a Temporary Regime in the Holy Land, the UN General Assembly Establishes a New Subcommittee, Britain Announces That the Ceasefire Order in the Holy City Is Still Valid

[This Newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: The UN Truce Commission held talks with Arab representatives today to establish a truce for the entire issue of Jerusalem. Jerusalem today was very quiet, and the British army strictly enforced the ceasefire order.

[U.S. News Agency, Lake Success, 4th] The Political Committee of the UN General Assembly today passed a proposal submitted by Cuba, advocating the establishment of a new subcommittee to draft a plan for a temporary regime in Palestine. The voting result was 33 votes to 7. The subcommittee is composed of committee members and representatives from Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Cuba, Guatemala, India, the Soviet Union, and the United States. U.S. representative Jessup supported the Cuban proposal. At the same time, the Trusteeship Council discussed the draft report to be submitted to the General Assembly on the efforts made to achieve a truce in the city of Jerusalem. The Council hoped that the efforts to achieve a truce in the entire city had failed, but the truce limited to the Old City had been agreed to by the Jewish representatives.

[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 4th] Officials declared on the 4th: The British side has straightforwardly ordered that the ceasefire order in Jerusalem is still valid, even though the deadline has passed.

[United Palestine, Tel Aviv, 4th] Jewish troops declared today that Lebanese artillery has begun shelling the Jewish city of Naftali, less than four miles north of Palestine.

### The Soviet Union Asks the United States to Explain the Reasons for Supporting the Japanese Economy

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th, Associated Press] Well-informed sources said: The Soviet Union has asked the United States to explain the reasons for its recent decision to step up the reconstruction of the Japanese economy. The Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission recently made a statement at a meeting of the Commission, saying that the United States should be more frank with its former allies and explain what it intends to do in Japan, and the reasons for taking such actions.

The reason why Soviet representative Panyushkin made such a statement is that U.S. officials recently said that the U.S. government intends to ask Congress to allocate a huge amount of funds as a fund for Japanese post-war undertakings. At the same time, it is heard that the United States will provide Japan with a large amount of raw material loans. Panyushkin did not ask the Far Eastern Commission to discuss actions related to this matter, but criticized the United States for distrusting the Far Eastern Commission. China, the Philippines, New Zealand, and Australia all supported the Soviet Union's position. They believe that the United States is currently planning to restore the Japanese economy, and the degree of restoration planned is also too large.

### Senate Urgent Telegram to the National Economic Council: Public Utilities Must Not Be Allowed to Rise Again; Recommends Two Measures to Be Adopted and Implemented to Avoid Leading to a Continuous General Price Cycle

[This Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Senate previously stated that public utilities have repeatedly adjusted prices, stimulating general prices and greatly affecting people's livelihoods. It solemnly proposed discussions in the general assembly and subcommittee meetings and suggested that the central government stabilize the measures, but there has been no news so far. Recently, it was reported that coal prices have increased by 45% compared to the previous month's allocation price. Various public utilities in the city will also use the automatic adjustment formula due to the increase in coal prices and will be forced to re-adjust. Therefore, the Senate felt deeply anxious and sent an urgent telegram to the National Economic Council yesterday, stating the pros and cons and suggesting two points, the original text of which is as follows:

To the National Economic Council in Nanjing, we have recently heard that the city's coal price has been approved by the central government and increased by 45%, which will be implemented from May 1st. However, since the coal price is the main part of the cost of various public utilities, the prices of various public utilities will inevitably increase. The fact that public utilities lead to general price increases has been seen repeatedly in the past in this city and in various places. In recent months, the city's general prices have just stabilized. If public utility prices are adjusted again, they will stimulate prices and set off a general price increase. The situation is truly alarming. This council previously believed that stabilizing public utility prices is a prerequisite for suppressing general price increases, and that general price increases repeatedly affect the cost of public utilities, especially coal prices and foreign exchange. Therefore, at the fifth general assembly, Resolution No. 1 on Imminent Issues was drafted, and the Shanghai Municipal Government was requested to forward it to the central government. However, there has been no news for more than a month, which is deeply regrettable. Now that the price of public utilities directly and indirectly affects the national economy and people's livelihoods, if it is allowed to lead general prices, then in a cycle, this will rise and that will increase, and economic collapse will be inevitable. This council has witnessed the crisis and deeply felt the pain. Therefore, as the National Economic Council is about to convene a meeting to study this case, we will again submit our opinions in an urgent telegram: (1) Immediately stop applying the automatic adjustment formula to public utilities and transportation businesses. From May, there should be no further price increases. If the costs are insufficient, please ask the central government to restore the subsidy system. (2) If the subsidy system is temporarily difficult to implement, please ask the government to pre-allocate materials and fuels (such as coal, diesel, and gasoline) required by the business at the price of April for three months or pre-settle foreign exchange for three months. The above two points are deeply consistent with the established policy of the central government, and the factors causing the price increase of the business can be eliminated. It is hoped that the council will quickly make a decision and adopt and implement it. Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Senate.

### Pirates in the Zhoushan Waters: The Communist Bandits Attempt to Incorporate Them; Police Officers in Disguise Go Deep Inside; Multiple Key Criminals Apprehended in Shanghai; Forgery of Customs Gold Unit Notes Also Cracked

[This Newspaper] On the morning of the 24th of last month, the City Police Bureau cracked a secret organization in the city that was attempting to incorporate Xu Xiaoyu's pirates in the Zhoushan waters of eastern Zhejiang. Li Huamin, "Chief of Staff of the Second Military Region of Central China" of the bandits, Wu (also known as Tao Niantang), "District Chief", and multiple pirate representatives were apprehended. At the same time, after searching, it was discovered that the organization was not only intending to endanger the city, but was also a forgery organization which intended to destabilize government finances by counterfeiting Customs Gold Unit notes. The case is still under investigation. The details of the cracking are as follows: In the Zhoushan waters of eastern Zhejiang, there are more than 300 pirates led by Xu Xiaoyu who appear from time to time to rob merchants. The number of victims are unknown. Recently, the pirates sent important cadres to Shanghai to contact Wu, the "District Chief" of the Communist bandits (also known as Tao Niantang), in an attempt to join forces and obtain assistance from the bandits. At that time, the City Police Bureau had learned of this intelligence, and immediately contacted inside lines for tracking and surveillance, and secretly sent police officers disguised as pirates to go deep inside. It was learned that Wu had sent the bandits Xu, Yang, Chen, etc. on April 10, carrying Wu's personal letter, to negotiate the incorporation with the pirate Ren. At the time, the pirates hoped that the Communist bandits would send more cadres to assist in the work and requested support of munitions. The Communist bandit representative Xu replied that the request would be reported to Wu, the "District Chief", for decision. On the 16th, the Communist bandit representative Yang and the pirate representative Ren held another meeting. Bandit Yang also said that Wu, the "District Chief", had set dinner with Ren that day (i.e., the 16th) at 4:00 p.m., agreeing to meet near the Golden Theatre. Wu came as expected, and Li Huamin, "Chief of Staff of the Second Military Region of Central China" of the bandits, participated in the matter. Wu fully agreed to the demands of the pirates, inquired in detail about the strength of the pirates, and said that after the inspection, he would transfer them to the higher echelons of the bandits for commissions and support. On the 23rd, the Communist bandits and pirates agreed to meet again in Zhongshan Park. The City Police Bureau, with the timing ripe, immediately took action, and arrested the key bandits Li Huamin, Wu, Bandit Yang Caiming, and the pirate representative Ren on the morning of that day. Based on the clues, Zhang Juemin, Chen Xixiang, and others were arrested. During the search of Wu's residence, the case workers found printing presses and paper for forging Customs Gold Unit notes. At the same time, forged thousand-yuan Customs Gold Unit notes totaling 940,000 yuan were found on the criminal's person. Later, based on the confession of Bandit Yang Caiming, forged banknotes totaling 6.4 million yuan and a machine for printing counterfeit banknotes were found in the home of the fugitive Jiang Yaofang. The police bureau will transfer the criminals to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation and will arrange the next action.

### Former Director of the Executive Headquarters Suspected of Bigamy; Spouse Willing to Withdraw Lawsuit; District Prosecutor's Office Orders Further Inquiry

[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Shiqin, the former Director of the Executive Headquarters Supply Office, met and fell in love with Zhu Zhenyi, a female staff member of the office, in 1946. In March 1947, they began living together. In February of this year, Zhu went to her sister's place in Hong Kong to recuperate, and Liu followed her to Hong Kong. At Zhu's request, they held a wedding ceremony, signed a marriage certificate, and published a marriage announcement in the Sing Tao Daily. Later, they returned to Shanghai together and settled in No. 22, Maishai Lane, Xing'an Road. On the morning of the 8th of last month, Liu said he wanted to go to Songjiang to burn incense. Zhu wanted to go with him, but Liu refused. Zhu became suspicious and followed him to No. 4, Lane 264, Shanhai Pass Road. A young woman named Shu Xiuxia came out and claimed to be Liu's legal wife. A conflict broke out between the two sides, and Shu used a rattan cane to beat Zhu, causing Zhu to be injured. Zhu filed a complaint with the Lujiawan Police Station against Shu for assault and presented the marriage certificate and the Sing Tao Daily to prove that she and Liu were husband and wife. The police station told her, "Your injury is very minor. This matter is very trivial in itself, but your complaint has put your husband in the crime of bigamy, do you know that?" Zhu replied, "I didn't know." Then, Liu was summoned for questioning. Liu confessed, "Zhu originally knew that I had a legal wife. She lived with me voluntarily. The cause of this matter was that I had previously lived with a young woman named Lou Caizhu. Lou has passed away, leaving behind a few pieces of jewelry. Zhu asked me for them, and I refused, which led to the conflict. As for marrying Zhu in Hong Kong, it was entirely due to my affection for her and to save face for her sister in Hong Kong. Now I know I was wrong." Shu Xiuxia said, "I married Liu in 1930. Zhu knew about it. I want to sue Zhu for hindering family harmony and adultery." Based on the above statements, the police station listed both Liu and Zhu as defendants, accusing them of "hindering family harmony" and "adultery," and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yesterday, Prosecutor Ding Tongjun summoned the defendants Liu Shiqin and Zhu Zhenyi, and the person involved, Shu Xiuxia. Liu and Zhu both said, "Although we signed a marriage certificate, we did not hold a public ceremony." Shu said, "I am willing to withdraw the lawsuit." The prosecutor believed that whether this case constituted bigamy was still under investigation and immediately ordered Liu and Zhu to remain on bail, and Shu was ordered to return home, and the inquiry would be held again at a later date.

### Female Tycoon Robbed of Precious Gem Bag; Struck Unconscious in Her Own Car; Diamonds and Jewels Worth 50-60 Billion Yuan Stolen

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Binjuan, a woman from Pudong, resides at No. 14, Lane 245, Julu Road. She is over forty years old and has been a broker for jewelry and diamonds for many years. She is often seen in the mansions of high-ranking officials and dignitaries, and as a result, she has accumulated considerable wealth. Years ago, she bought a car for transportation and lived extravagantly, which aroused the covetousness of criminals. At around 2:00 PM on the 3rd, Chen returned to her residence from the jewelry market. As she was about to get out of the car at the entrance of Fuhai Lane on Julu Road, three thugs who had been lying in wait suddenly rushed out from the side of the road, blocked the car with guns, threatened the driver Ju Zhicai (from Nantong), and forbade him to make a sound, forcing Chen to get back into the car. Two thugs also sat in the passenger compartment, and another thug drove the car westward along Lin Sen Road, through Ferguson Road and Hongqiao Road, to the desolate suburbs of Fahua.

The area was sparsely populated. After the car stopped, the thugs ordered Chen Binjuan to hand over her valuables. Chen refused, and they struck her head violently with the butt of a pistol, rendering her unconscious. The two thugs then began to search and robbed her of a "treasure bag" from her abdomen. They then got out of the car one after another, jumped onto a public bus, and fled. The driver woke up the mistress and drove back to the nest. Upon checking the lost items, it was found that a total of nine medium-sized diamonds, weighing about four carats in total, a red ruby ring with small diamonds, two sapphire rings with small diamonds, a small diamond-studded jade butterfly brooch, a two-carat round diamond ring, two sapphire rings, an octagonal gold-set jade green piece weighing about 30 grams, a platinum-set diamond brooch, a rectangular diamond, a finely rounded pearl weighing about five or six points, a pair of five-carat thick diamonds, two large jadeite oval rings (gold-set), and another one (platinum-set), a six-carat heavy yellow thick diamond, a large hexagonal sapphire, a rose gold diamond-studded women's watch, and another women's watch, a large hexagonal sapphire, a pair of small sapphire heart-shaped diamond-studded loops, and many other valuable ornaments were lost. In short, the total weight of the diamonds in this case is about 430 carats. According to market prices, it is worth more than 50-60 billion yuan. After the incident, Chen reported it to the Lujiawan Police Station. After receiving the report, Police Chief Song personally led Inspector Ni Jiafeng and several plainclothes police officers to pursue the robbers in all directions. Later, a large diamond ring and a pearl necklace were found in Chen's car. The next day, through the efforts of Inspector Ni and others, another two-carat diamond ring and other parts of the stolen goods were recovered. Police Chief Song attached great importance to this major robbery case, ordered all criminal police officers to strictly pursue the robbers, and set a deadline for solving the case.

After completing the lap, all the athletes lined up in the center of the field in columns, facing the west command platform.

At 3:37 PM, the ceremony began. After playing music and saluting, Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, first respectfully read the head of state's message (full text in yesterday's newspaper), followed by speeches by Zhu Jiahua, President of the Games, and Wu Guozhen, Vice President of the Games (see below), and the athlete representatives taking the oath. Finally, everyone shouted slogans: "Long live the National Games! Long live President Chiang! Long live the Republic of China!" At this time, an airplane from this newspaper and three other airplanes in the sky above the venue distributed leaflets. For a while, the colors of red and green were intertwined, and cheers rang out. The newspaper also released a thousand homing pigeons into the venue. As the flocks of wings passed, the audience applauded in waves. The mood of the entire conference can be said to be excited and enthusiastic. It is a pity that the air force parachute performance, which was originally scheduled, was temporarily announced to be canceled due to the strong winds at high altitude, which was a bit of a disappointment.

### Mass Group Exercises; Expressing the Beauty of Cooperation; When the Dancers Raised Their Hands, They Were Like Seagulls Flying in Formation; When They Lowered Their Heads, They Were Like Sheep Grazing

After the ceremony, a mass group exercise of 6,000 people was held. The participants were from 52 schools, divided into 88 groups, arranged in neat columns. Under the general command of Zhang Juefei, the chief referee of the Games, and accompanied by the music of the Children's Orchestra of the Municipal Children's Education Center, they performed neat and magnificent calisthenics. All the male and female students participating in the performance were wearing white tops, blue shorts, and white shoes. When the ranks moved forward, it was like white waves rolling in a blue sea. The audience praised this beautiful picture. After the exercises began, the rhythm was harmonious, and the advances and retreats were orderly. When the dancers raised their hands, they were like flocks of seagulls flying in formation, and when they lowered their heads, they were like sheep grazing. The melody of youth and the beauty of large group cooperation were fully expressed here. The audience's applause was incessant. The opening ceremony of the National Games came to a successful conclusion at 4:45 PM.

### The Spirit of Sportsmanship; Striving for Victory in Harmony and Cooperation; Speech by Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua

In his speech at the opening ceremony of the Games, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua said: "The Seventh National Games were originally scheduled to be held in 1937, but were suspended due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, I am very pleased that we can open it in Shanghai today. The lineup of this Games is better than in previous Games. For example, Taiwan, which has been separated from the motherland for fifteen years, and the Northeast, which has been invaded by barbarians for fourteen years, have representatives here today. There are also more overseas units than before. The police and the military can also form their own units. All of this is enough to add to the characteristics of the Games. In ancient times, our country's education always emphasized the combination of literary and martial arts. In modern times, due to the lack of attention to physical education, the people's bodies have become weak and the country has faced many disasters. Since the establishment of the National Government, we have been trying our best to promote physical education in order to strengthen the people and the country. The spirit of a sportsman must be to strive for victory in harmony. Do not be arrogant in victory, and do not be discouraged in defeat. In particular, we should pay attention to cooperation, disregard personal success or failure, and take care of the glory of the whole. The 14th World Games will be held in London soon. I hope that this Games will have good results, so that our athletes can also compete with the athletes of other countries in the world. I also hope that we can learn from each other in a spirit of cooperation and spread this spirit to the people, so as to transform social customs and revive the nation and the country. Finally, I wish all athletes to work hard, be healthy, and succeed."

### Mayor Wu's Speech: Holding the National Games on Schedule is the Greatest Miracle

Mayor Wu stated in his speech: "It is a great honor for the 7th National Games to be held in Shanghai. However, due to limited funding, environmental constraints, and the urgency of time, the hospitality may be lacking, which I deeply regret. However, in these times of internal strife and national depletion, the fact that the National Games can be held on schedule is already the greatest miracle. Firstly, I should thank the enthusiastic assistance of the people of the whole country. I believe that the Republic of China will surely have a prosperous future. Secondly, I thank the enthusiastic individuals in the sports community from all over the country. Thirdly, I thank the efforts of Director-General Hao of the Games, which have enabled the Games to be held smoothly. Finally, I hope that all athletes will forgive any shortcomings in the hospitality."

### Change of Starting Point for Games Shuttle Buses

Notice from the Transportation Section of the National Games: (1) The Transportation Section hopes that all vehicles and spectators will abide by traffic control rules during the Games. (2) The starting point of the special Route 4 transportation, originally scheduled from Pingliang Road and Lan Road to the venue, will be changed from the Tilanqiao triangular area starting from the 6th. (3) For all special transportation buses, the original plan was to disembark at the east grandstand and board at the west grandstand. From the 6th onward, in addition to disembarking still at the east grandstand, boarding will be changed to simultaneously board in front of both the east and west grandstand entrances.

### Xinjiang Female Athletes Include Many of Mixed Race

Malayan Team Uniforms are the Most Beautiful

[Report from this newspaper] On the opening day of the 7th National Games, the weather was sunny and the breeze gentle. Jiangwan Road was bustling with activity. It is estimated that the number of spectators was close to 100,000, setting the highest record in history.

Each delegation has a uniform. The Guizhou team led the way, and the Shanghai team brought up the rear. The Honolulu athletes were the fewest, numbering only three, but their colorful Hawaiian shirts were the most eye-catching.

The Indonesian uniforms have the most beautiful colors, with blue-green tops and light pink trousers. The Philippine uniforms are taupe, and the female athletes all wear mid-heeled shoes.

The most exquisite material for the uniforms undoubtedly belongs to the Malayan delegation, which consists of fine gray flannel, pure wool ties, and red "Malayan Chinese" lettering, for both men and women.

The Malayan Chinese team also printed a large number of "7th National Games Special Edition" publications, which are beautifully printed and rich in content. It is said that the cost per copy is one million national currency. The team leader distributed them to reporters and distinguished guests at the venue, making them the most generous at the event.

The small round caps of the Xinjiang athletes are quite admirable. There were many who pointed and commented, and many of the female athletes were of mixed race, with golden hair.

The biggest problem was transportation. The number of vehicles was impossible to count. During the opening and closing of the Games, the roads were congested. Some estimated that the speed of the cars was slower than that of rickshaws, and that rickshaws were slower than bicycles. (Talent)

### Chairman Wu Moves Around and Instructs on the Arrangement of Each Venue

[Report from this newspaper] Wu Guozhen, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the National Games, arrived at the resting room of the swimming pool at the venue at 10:00 am on the 5th to discuss with Hao Gengsheng, Director-General of the National Games, how to make the facilities at the venue more adequate. The originally planned meeting of the heads of each group was cancelled because the heads of each group were busy inspecting all parts of the venue to solve various problems on the spot. They first walked to the front of the gate, then to the venue, and then to the roads surrounding the venue, to find the people in charge of the reception, general affairs, and ticketing groups. They gave instructions on the spot that traffic and vendors needed to be regulated, and that a large map of the venue should be posted in front of the gate, and that signs should be widely set up. Tickets should specify the date, when the opening ceremony will be held, and when the competitions will be held, all of which should be announced in advance. After giving instructions, Chairman of the Organizing Committee got into his car and returned to the Municipal Government to work.

### "Faster Than Postal Service to Deliver the Message" Torch Relay Race Completed Arrived at the Venue on Time Respectfully Presents the Head of State's Message

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday was the last day of the Beijing-Shanghai Torch Relay Race. The fourteen members of the seventh team were responsible for the 42-kilometer run between Taicang and Zhenru. At 7:22 a.m., Yang Dajun, holding the torch high, set off from Taicang first. Prior to this, people from all walks of life in Taicang gathered at the station to see them off. Yu Baorui and Wang Ruiying were temporarily appointed to present a banner reading "Accumulate Health to Achieve Strength", which was accepted by Wang Tiesheng on behalf of the team. They also presented a torch as a souvenir. After the departure, the entire seventh team accompanied Yang for a short run, and then took turns passing the torch. The Taicang mounted police team escorted them along the way. The weather was sunny and the breeze gentle. The wheat ears along the road were heavy with grain, and the villagers gathered in groups of three or five, eagerly watching the athletes. The team members ran swiftly amidst excited cheers. At 7:58 a.m., the third runner, Zhao Guoping, arrived at Gelong Town in Jiading County.

Zhou Mingxing, the county magistrate of Jiading, Hu Jinwen, the director of the police bureau, the heads of various townships, and the self-defense corps, accompanied the athletes throughout their passage through Jiading County. They first waited in Gelong and then rushed to the Hujia Wood Bridge on the border of Shanghai and Jiading to see them off. The athletes passed through Waigang Town at 8:13 a.m. and arrived at the West Gate of Jiading at 8:43 a.m. The people along the way spontaneously gathered to welcome them. The line stretched for several miles. Tang Daleng, a female student from Lianxi National Primary School in Jiading County, presented flowers on behalf of the school. Yang Dayaoyao, a female student from the county high school, presented a banner reading "Self-Improvement" on behalf of the Liming Sports Association. Miss Wang Caixia also presented flowers on behalf of the team. Zhou, the county magistrate of Jiading, also presented a banner reading "Passing on the Torch", which was accepted by Jin Daji and Zhao Bilan on behalf of the team. The atmosphere was enthusiastic, and the applause resounded through the clouds.

At 9:40 a.m., Qiao Feng strode into Nanxiang. More than a thousand students and people from Xianggong Public School, the Central National School, the Huai Shao Education Institute, and the Dade Elementary School lined up to welcome them. Huai Shao presented a horizontal banner reading "Faster than Postal Service to Deliver the Message", and Misses Wang Jinfeng and Sun Xiujuan from Dade Elementary School presented a flower basket on behalf of the school. Cheers rose one after another, creating an unprecedented spectacle.

Entering the City, Viewers Block the Streets

At 10:18 a.m., Shen Beizhang, the last runner of the seventh team, ran into the Shanghai urban area. The entire team then joined the run. At 10:35 a.m., they arrived at Zhenru. The Road Construction Machinery Training Office of the Highway Administration had prepared refreshments and other consolation items in advance, which were distributed immediately. At noon, they also treated the members of the seventh and eighth teams to lunch. At the same time, the office specially sent staff to measure the exact route and distance from Zhenru to the venue during the team's break. The result was that the entire journey was determined to be 20 kilometers, which would be run by ten people, each running 2,000 meters in ten minutes. Therefore, it was decided to depart after 1:30 p.m.

After further discussion, it was believed that the traffic conditions along the way were not perfect, and that the estimated time could not be maintained. Therefore, the departure was temporarily advanced to 1:00 p.m. Nearby residents learned that this section was the final section of the entire journey, and that the opening ceremony of the Games was waiting for the runners to arrive. For a moment, everyone followed the runners, and the bicycle procession reached more than 200 bicycles.

Resting and Waiting, Striding into the Venue

The eighth team was led by Liu Zhenzhong, who passed the torch in order. Amidst the surging crowd, the lead car, the command car, the escort car, the follow-up car, and the reporter car advanced slowly in two rows, attracting tens of thousands of people on both sides of the railway to move and cheer. The procession passed through Qiujiang Road, North Sichuan Road, the intersection of Wusong Road, Jiulong Road, and the Jiaxing Road Bridge, heading straight for Qimei Road. No less than tens of thousands of people stood and watched along the way. The athletes ran excitedly amidst the sound of firecrackers, and their pace was extremely fast. They arrived at the Wujiaochang roundabout before 2:00 p.m. Because it was still early before the opening ceremony, the entire team had to stand by the roadside and wait.

As the bell rang at 3:00 p.m., the sixty-six runners of the relay race team were divided into two rows. The first eleven runners each held a torch, led by Wang Nancun. Under the expectation of tens of thousands of spectators, they entered the venue through the east grandstand gate, ascended the west grandstand, and respectfully presented the Head of State's message to the Games Chairman. The music was melodious, and the atmosphere was solemn. This historical mission symbolizing the spirit of the National Games was declared complete amidst applause.

### Shen Bao Special Plane Flies Over the Games Distributing Celebration Leaflets

[Report from this newspaper] To celebrate the opening of the 7th National Games, this newspaper distributed celebration leaflets by plane over the Games yesterday afternoon and released carrier pigeons. The plane distributing leaflets was a joint effort between this newspaper and the Central Air Transport Corporation. The Central Air Transport Corporation specially dispatched an XTT21 passenger plane, carrying three reporters and photographers from this newspaper, which arrived over the Games at the time when the torch conveying the President's message arrived at the venue. The plane circled the venue six times, dropping 50,000 red celebration leaflets. The photographer from this newspaper also took shots of the Games from the air. The plane was flown by Director He Shourong and Chief Pilot Hong Qiming of the Central Air Transport Corporation and was the largest of the planes distributing leaflets yesterday.

The carrier pigeon performance was organized in cooperation with the China Victory Carrier Pigeon Association. It was solemnly held yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. after the opening ceremony of the Games. Early in the morning at 8:00 a.m., this newspaper specially prepared two carrier pigeon vans, which went to the locations of the various members to collect the pigeons. At around 12:00 noon, more than a thousand pigeons raised by more than thirty members were gathered, divided into more than forty cages. At 2:30 p.m., the vans entered the southern end of the venue from the west grandstand and were placed in order. The members then tied colorful slogans and ribbons around the pigeons' necks and released them simultaneously. The second segment was a collective flight, soaring high into the sky, creating a spectacular sight. The flight lasted for half an hour before it was completed. More than a thousand pigeons circled the venue several times and flew back to their old nests.

### Another Wonderful Performance Thousands of Carrier Pigeons Circle the Venue Several Times

Games Fire Brigade on Duty

Information from the Games Security Group: The Second Fire Brigade (Shanghai North District Private Fire Brigade) of the Games Security Group Special Duty Brigade has started duty, consisting of seven squads. The headquarters of the brigade is located under the east grandstand of the Games, with a dedicated telephone number: (02) 55-59 branch.

### Hot Item New Photos Taken by This Newspaper Spectators Rush to Buy

To promote the spirit of social service, this newspaper has set up a temporary office to the east of the east grandstand of the Games. The main business has been detailed in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday was the first day of the Games opening ceremony. Spectators gathered at the door of the office, and those admiring the National Games photos blocked the way. The sale of photos was also very busy, creating a feeling of being overwhelmed like on Shanyin Road.

A giant thermometer, as tall as a person, hangs at the door of this newspaper's office. Passers-by stop to watch; their faces are smiling, as if they are placing unlimited hope in the recent sunny weather.

A gentleman from the Gansu Provincial Delegation was very interested in the various secret photos displayed by this newspaper and proposed that the photographic reporter of this newspaper take activity photos on their behalf. A gentleman from the Philippine Overseas Chinese Delegation ordered photos of the Philippine delegation taken during the Games, regardless of size, two of each type, to keep as souvenirs.

[Ma Yujun Seeks Old Friend] Ma Yujun from the Shandong Province referee group is looking for his old friend, Mr. Hu Zongfan. It is said that Mr. Hu is a Shanghai sports reporter. It is hoped that Mr. Hu and his relatives will relay the message to Mr. Ma after seeing the newspaper.

### This Newspaper's Broadcast Van Mission Ends

[Report from this newspaper] This time, the special broadcast van sent by this newspaper accompanied the Beijing-Shanghai Torch Relay Race for interviews and broadcasting along the way. It worked hard for four days and was extremely well received by all parties. Yesterday morning, the special van followed Mi Hu from Taicang under the leadership of Liu Jianqu, a special correspondent from this newspaper. The special van of this newspaper met on the way and arrived at the venue together. After broadcasting the latest news for the last time in front of the Games gate, the mission was declared complete.

### Starlight

Dozens of members of the torch relay race team rested at the Zhenru Telegraph Bureau yesterday afternoon. The bureau was the old site of Jinan University. Local men, women, old, and young flocked to see the heroes.

The photographer inside the bureau rushed to get a shot. Suddenly, a certain athlete set off a firecracker, creating a deafening sound. The photographer was greatly startled.

Shen Beizhang is a basketball star from Jiaotong University. His body is slightly chubby, and the distance he ran was relatively long. Therefore, after he completed his mission, everyone said "You worked hard!"

At 11:30 a.m., the Highway Administration provided lunch. It seemed that they emphasized "quantity" rather than "quality".

The last section started with Liu Zhenzhong. At 1:00 p.m., they departed from Zhenru. The athletes were particularly excited, and their speed was faster than usual. Moreover, because they departed too early, they only arrived at the Wujiaochang roundabout around 2:00 p.m.

When the long-distance running team arrived in Shanghai, the roads they passed were deserted. There were applause and cheers, and the sound of firecrackers was endless. At the intersection of Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road, the Boy Scout Band of Jianhua Voluntary Elementary School played music to show their respect.

The students from Jiaotong University gathered at Wujiaochang in the city center. Led by Wang Nancun, holding a torch, the sixty athletes ran into the National Games venue, delivering the Head of State's message and completing a major task.

Eleven torches are hanging high on the grandstand of the venue, in front of the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Symbolizing the bright and splendid future of the National Games.

### Softball Competition

[Report from this newspaper] According to the corrected order announced by the registration group of the Games: The time for the softball game (men) between Fujian and the winner between Zhejiang and the Police should be at 10:30 AM on the 9th at Yi Yuan.

### Flying Fortress Not Well Received White Leather Shoes Turn Into Black Leather Shoes

Car thefts, stolen parts and tires have been discovered "Be careful first."

Those who bought tickets could not enter the venue, while those without tickets crowded in. The "Flying Fortress" was not well received on both sides.

People who could not find a way to enter the venue peeked through the cracks in the bamboo fence and billboards, watching the Western spectacle. Some even found rattan chairs to sit on, feeling extremely comfortable.

Ladies and gentlemen coming out of the venue had white leather shoes turned into black leather shoes, and black leather shoes turned into gray leather shoes.

Today seems like Air Force Day. Airplanes were competing in the sky, diving and soaring. Leaflets were flying everywhere, so people were snatching and grabbing, like picking up banknotes.

### Soccer War Opens: Zhejiang Wins Against Philippines; Scores Three Times in Extra Time; Air Force Easily Defeats Hankou 5-1

[Our Dispatch] Although the opening ceremony of the National Games was solemnly held yesterday afternoon in full view of the public, the real curtain-raiser took place in the morning at the soccer fields of Yiyuan and Shanghai University.

At Yiyuan, there were two matches: Air Force vs. Hankou, and Zhejiang vs. Philippines. In the first match, the experience of both the Air Force and Hankou teams was slightly lacking. However, the Air Force, under the guidance of the renowned Dai Linjing, had better coordination, and ultimately won with a score of 5-1. In the second match, the skills of both sides were evenly matched. The Philippines was initially strong but later weakened. Goalkeeper Ke Tengjing gave a brilliant performance, but Zhejiang eventually turned defeat into victory with a score of 6-3.

Air Force vs. Hankou Match

The first match began at exactly 9:00 AM. The Air Force chose to play with the sun in their faces. At 10 minutes, Air Force's Mai Runming crossed the ball, and Liang Guangzhen gently tapped it into the bottom of the Hankou net, opening the scoring. After that, the back-and-forth exchanges saw both sides make some mistakes. At 25 minutes, Air Force's Mai Runming took a corner kick. Suddenly, a long whistle blew from the crowd, as someone from Hankou had handled the ball. Air Force's Tian Rongfa took the penalty kick and scored, making it 2-0. Five minutes later, Air Force's Liang Guangzhen, receiving several excellent passes from Tian Rongfa, continuously scored two goals. At the end of the first half, the scoreboard showed the Air Force impressively leading 4-0.

In the second half, Hankou's goalkeeper Tan Hancheng replaced Ye Tao. After the change, the Air Force launched a full-scale attack. Unexpectedly, a ball was shot from the crowd, but Tan Hancheng calmly caught it. However, the Hankou team's defensive line was under constant threat. At 15 minutes, the Air Force's forward line made several clear short passes, and the ball once again entered the Hankou team's territory. Lan Baotian kicked the ball high, and it went straight into the net, making it 5-0. After that, although the Hankou team had several opportunities to attack the Air Force's goal, their coordination was poor, and several attempts were abandoned halfway, failing to achieve success. In the last five minutes, the ball lingered in front of the Air Force's goal. Hankou's Chen Zixiu kicked the ball, hitting Liu Baolin's upper leg and bouncing into the corner of the Air Force's goal. The scoreboard showed 5-1, saving Hankou from a shutout.

Zhejiang vs. Philippines Match

The second match started at 10:30 AM. The Philippines team chose the field, and Zhejiang kicked off. The two teams exchanged passes politely. With several long kicks and short passes, the footwork was crisp and sharp, sweeping away the sluggishness of the first match. Within 15 minutes, Zhejiang made three dangerous attacks, but all were saved by the Philippines' Ke Tengjing. The Philippines team was unwilling to be outdone. Lin Luowan led the troops to attack, and Chen Zhujun passed perfectly. Shi Bingshan lifted his foot and slammed the ball straight into the bottom of the Zhejiang net. However, misfortunes never come singly. Capitalizing on the momentum of their initial goal, the Philippines team continued to wreak havoc on the Zhejiang defensive line. The forward line made high-speed passes. With Shi Bingshan closely guarded, a ball was lobbed to Lin Luowan, who did not disappoint, scoring another goal, making it 2-0. At that time, Zhejiang replaced right-back Fei Chunlin with Xu Sheng yuan. At 30 minutes, Zhejiang's Wu Binghao retaliated with a long-range shot. The ball entered the goal from the upper left corner, leaving Ke Tengjing helpless. Having learned from this lesson, Tengjing guarded against the ball's trajectory, carefully watching his position. Sure enough, Su Ziwen made several diagonal shots, but Tengjing calmly jumped up to save them, turning danger into safety. As the first half was about to end, Philippines' Lin Luowan connected... the ball flew out as fast as a flat cannon shot, and... followed closely... making it Philippines 3, Zhejiang 1.

(The rest of this section is too damaged to translate accurately.)

During the half, the Philippines team was exhausted and in a completely passive position. Four minutes later, Zhejiang's Zhang Jie scored first, followed by Lu Qingxiang and others, who added two more goals, sealing the victory. If not for Ke Tengjing's efforts, the Philippines team would have lost by at least ten goals.

### Liaoning United Not Strong; Dalian Wins Easily

[Our Dispatch] The Dalian soccer team defeated Liaoning United with a brave performance yesterday, resulting in a score of 2-0. If Dalian's forwards could have been less weak in front of the goal, they could have won by at least half a dozen goals. During the 70 minutes of chaotic battle, although the total number of goals scored by both sides was only two, the situation was almost one-sided. Liaoning United was constantly under pressure due to their relatively weak strength.

The match was held in the large sports field, and the order was quite chaotic. In the end, almost all the spectators entered the field.

At 5:30 PM, the match began. Dalian kicked off first, and immediately launched a full-scale attack, with dangerous situations constantly arising in front of the Liaoning United goal. However, Dalian's forwards missed many opportunities because their shots in front of the goal were either too high or their footwork was slow and powerless. Liaoning United's goalkeeper made frequent saves amidst the chaos, which was really painstaking. After 35 minutes of fierce fighting, neither side scored in the first half.

Switching sides to fight again, Dalian's offensive was still strong. After five minutes of contact, they flanked the attack from the left, lobbing the ball in front of the goal. Yan Chengkuan seized the opportunity from the crowd and kicked the ball slowly into the net, opening the scoring. After that, Dalian still had several good chances, but they all went over the bar.

More than six minutes later, Dalian won a corner kick opportunity. Jiang Benshen kicked it perfectly, but the goalkeeper jumped up to meet it and missed. Chen Chaofu arrived in time and tapped it in, making it 2-0.

After that, although Liaoning United attacked once, they were unsuccessful. After a long and arduous battle, time ran out, and Dalian will face Guangdong on the 7th.

### Army Scores the Decisive Goal; Guangdong Celebrates Peace and Prosperity; Army Defeats Qingdao 1-0; Guangdong Overwhelms Henan 4-0

[Our Dispatch] In yesterday morning's two preliminary soccer matches at Shanghai University, the Army defeated Qingdao 1-0, and Guangdong overwhelmed Henan, with Henan's poor performance resulting in a 4-0 shutout.

Army vs. Qingdao Match

The Army vs. Qingdao match began at 9:05 AM. Army's Zhang Jinhai did not play, and Qu Yongfu took his place as center forward, with his vacant position filled by Zhang Renyi. On the Qingdao side, goalkeeper Yang Yongsen only watched from the sidelines, and center-back Liu Wenxue temporarily acted as the goalkeeper. With a whistle from the referee, the battle began. The Army attacked first, but the forward line dribbled too much, and good opportunities were often missed. At five minutes, Gao Xiuqing took a shot from the penalty spot, but it was saved by Liu Wenxue. Qingdao counter-attacked, and Zhang Jiliang and Sheng Dexin entered together, but were blocked by Wu Qixiang. After a long period of fierce fighting, although the Army's offensive was strong, their forwards lacked shooting skills, and their passing was often sluggish. In addition, Qingdao's defenders were able to run and fight. The Army soldiers had the problem of "a rat pulling a turtle, unable to start." The first half ended in chaos, with no goals scored.

At the start of the second half, Qingdao continued with its original lineup. After six minutes, Army's Gu Yisa entered the field, replacing Zhang Renyi. Qu Yongfu retreated to midfield, and Gao Xiuqing was reassigned as center forward. After the forward line was adjusted, the offensive became even stronger. However, after 28 minutes of battle, the two armies were fighting in front of the Qingdao goal. The Army won a corner kick opportunity, which was taken by Fei Chunhua. Qu Yongfu took a clear shot and hit the left corner, establishing the foundation for victory. After that, although Qingdao tried to counter-attack, the Army's two Wus and one Meng were sitting in the back, as solid as a rock. In the end, the Army eliminated Qingdao with a score of 1-0.

Guangdong vs. Henan Match

The Guangdong vs. Henan match followed. Led by Hou Chengtuo, the "Thunderbolt" team took the offensive first. The Henan team was weaker and only had the ability to parry. In the first half, Guangdong won by three goals. (1) Ma Xian got a response from Hou Chengtuo, picked it over Chai Juzhen, and slipped past Guan Xinyou, and shot low into the net with his right foot, clear and beautiful. (2) Ma Qunxian got Chen Rongzhi's high pass, and before the ball fell, he whipped his leg and slammed the ball into the net. (3) Five minutes before the end of the first half, Liu Xuezi got the opportunity at 15 yards and shot low into the goal.

Switching sides to fight again, Guangdong continued with its remaining strength, attacking incessantly. After five minutes, Liu Xuezi picked a shot into the right corner from near the goal. Wang Tianze used his hands and feet together to block it, but the ball had already rolled past the white line. Zhang Jimin hurriedly hooked it out, but the referee did not see it, avoiding the disaster. At 15 minutes, Lin Qiquan lobbed the ball in the left wing, and Hou Chengtuo dribbled and passed it into the left corner, making it 4-0. After that, Guangdong continued to control the whole game, but they had already scored a lot, so they did not go too far. When the final whistle blew, they won by four goals.

### Beware of Pockets: Pickpocket Spotted at the Venue; Surprisingly Wearing Four Badges on His Chest

[Our Dispatch] The National Games security personnel caught a pickpocket nicknamed "Little Sichuan" in the venue yesterday, who was surprisingly equipped in American style, wearing as many as four badges on his chest.

### Men's Basketball Preliminary Round: Qingdao Narrowly Defeats Rehe; Rehe Team Unable to Find an Offensive Method

[Our Dispatch] In the men's basketball preliminary round, only one match was held yesterday: Rehe vs. Qingdao, which took place at 5:00 PM in the first basketball court. The audience was quite crowded. The referees were Zheng Zhifang and Wang Yiyi.

After the start of the game, Qingdao's right forward Cheng Jianing scored several consecutive goals, taking a 4-0 lead. Rehe's left guard Ma Xifeng then scored, and the situation gradually became balanced. Qingdao's Cheng Jianing was accurate with his shots, and center Yu Dehai and left guard Yang Yongsen, two tall players, were good at using their height to intercept the opponent's passes, gaining many advantages. In the first half, Qingdao took a 16-10 lead.

The Rehe team's coordination was not weak, but they could not find an effective way to attack, nor did they fully utilize the human tactical strategy. Individually, Ma Xifeng and Wang Pingzhou were more outstanding. In the second half, they once forced the score to 18-15, but it was a flash in the pan. Qingdao's Cheng and Yu repeatedly scored, and they took a commanding lead again with 42-27. Although Rehe quickly caught up, it was too late. The final score was 42-38, and Qingdao won.

Qingdao always fought with five players, so that in the last minute, Jia Minqing was fouled out and replaced by Li Shiyun. With Qingdao's victory, they advanced to the next game, and tomorrow they will compete with Malaya for the right to play in the quarter-finals. The scores of the two teams in yesterday's game are as follows:

### A Casual Discussion on the General Trend of Field Events

— Our Reporter Hu Jiangchang

[Our Special Report] Field events have been barren in the country for more than ten years. On the eve of the opening of the 7th National Games, a casual discussion on the general trend of field events, speculating on who will win the championship, can only be said to be a bold attempt.

For example, in the past 17 years, some veteran field athletes have passed away, such as Fu Bao... and Hua Suian; some have died, such as Chen...qiu; some have retired, and some have unexpectedly left the field event arena. However, most of these field event... features... to give us some shadows... that... from various places... results.

How accurate are these results? Under what kind of atmosphere and weather conditions were they...? What...? What about the sand and soil...? Do the various have...?……all this…。　　　　　　　　　　　Real results. Also, an arena and a good hand, therefore, occupy Luo...shan. A...get well and create....

Moreover, glancing at the preliminary results from various places, there are not many men's events in field events that have broken national records. In this case, several teams with similar strength, such as Taiwan, Fujian, Shanghai, Navy, Army, and Air Force, seem to be dark horses, and everyone has the potential to take the lead.

Men's

Taiwan Not Difficult to Win the Championship

First, let's talk about men's field events. Taiwan, after the restoration, came with excellent double jumps (long jump, triple jump) and three... records, sending out all their troops. Moreover, each item has the strength... four to participate in the competition, between... the standard... thing. But the Air Force's three... also... the Navy's along the line... of course, is Taiwan's strong enemy. - The team... average, below... People... results balance, if can... strive for some of the top four seats in each event, then... the score, is also... considerable.

Below, I still... In Taiwanese athletes, the double... and the long jump and the triple jump. The old general of Taiwanese athletics, Zhang... Xian, once had the result of 7.28 meters in the long jump and 14.49 meters in the triple jump. Although he is old now, he still hopes to be strong and create a miracle for the motherland.

The long jump of Ma Hua Li Fen once created an excellent record of 7.06 meters. The 6.69 meters of the Liaoning United Wang Shilin, the 6.64 meters of the Taiwanese Zhang Liren, the 6.53 meters of Hebei Cui Zhensheng, and the old general Zhang Jia of Ting Su, etc., can all compete for results. In terms of the triple jump, the 14 meters of the Air Force's Huang Jian and the 13.40 meters of the Fujian's Xu Fengshan are not weak.

Javelin Expected to Break Record

Secondly, it depends on the javelin of Wang Xuewu of the Navy. This man was frustrated in the 6th National Games; the recent results, I heard, reached 55.2 meters, breaking Zhou Changxing's national record of 53.85 meters. This time, I wish Mr. Wang to do well and make a splash in one fell swoop. In addition, the 49.92 meters of the Army's Chen Jichuan and the 48.9 meters of the Taiwan... are all scoring records.

Shot put, discus, high jump, and pole vault are unlikely to have amazing results. Look at the known excellent records of the events, the shot put has Qi Peilin's 12.95 meters, and his discus also has a result of 41.4 meters. The Air Force's Wang Rui's 39 meters is not high either. The high jump seems to be the strongest with the 1.83 meters of the Army's Liu Mengjiu. The results of the pole vault in various places are not worth mentioning. After Fu Wang (Bao Ying), is there really no second person to think about?

Women's

Fujian's Strength is the Most Powerful

Looking at this year's women's field events, it will be more exciting than the men's field events. To be optimistic, all records have the possibility of being refreshed. The overall championship should be most likely to be won by the Fujian team. The team has a total of ten members, most of whom are young students from Pu Tian Middle School. They are aggressive, solid, and have all male-type sports postures. Seeing the invincible results they achieved during their expedition to Beijing and Shanghai last year, you will know the basis of my prediction.

Then, let's discuss the possibility of breaking the records in each event: in order, let's first talk about the high jump. In the selection competition in Beiping, Wu Shusen jumped over 1.365 meters in one fell swoop. Zhu Tianzhen's national record of 1.355 meters was completely shattered. Ms. Wu can surely win the high jump championship this time. Chen...zhen of Shanghai is also close to the national record with 1.34 meters. It is a pity that Jinan's Mei Lin, who has a good record of 1.40 meters, could not participate for some reason.

In the long jump, Chen Biying of Fujian has a result of 5.03 meters, only 0.03 meters short of Yin...'s national record of 5.06 meters. Ms. Chen is full of energy, and if the situation is normal, she will surely break the record. In addition, Qing Chen Duannian's 4.68 meters, He Zhang Ganmei's 4.61 meters, and Wu Shuying of Fujian's 4.55 meters are all good works.

Beiping's Three Iron New Comet

The most gratifying thing in this year's women's field events is that Beiping has discovered a new comet in shot put and discus - Wang Canhua. Miss Wang is as strong as a man, and with a swing of her arm, she gets 10.87 meters in the shot put and 33.37 meters in the discus. Both of these broke the record held by Chen Rongtang for more than ten years. This time, she will undoubtedly take the double-iron championship.

Chen Rongtang, the women's three-iron champion of the last National Games, made a comeback this time and represented Indonesia. Although Chen is old and fat, the most important thing for a three-iron thrower is stable weight. Although Ms. Chen's recent results have not been officially tested, her strength is still not to be underestimated. In the women's three-iron, she can still compete for the second and third place.

In addition, Xian Shaomei of Beiping also has the strength of more than 10 meters in the shot put. Her discus results are also good. He Zhang Ruiyan's double results are not weak either. Can score points. In terms of the javelin, Wang...hua wants to maintain the shot put and discus strength relationship, and has not seen participation, then, will see Ping Xian Shaomei, Tai Li Shude, Chen Rong, etc.

But the Fujian team's team members have average results, with more chances to score, so the hope of first place in total score is of course the most.

The above are just some... Like what I said at the beginning of this article, any unexpected factor is the result of the original prediction. However, assuming that everything is normal, I believe that these conjectures, although not in the middle, are not...

### Wang Zhengting and Zhang Boling Talk About Their Feelings on the National Games to Our Reporter Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday was the opening of the 7th National Games. Our reporter specially invited Dr. Wang Zhengting to express his feelings about the National Games. He said: (1) The National Games have not been held for twelve years. Today, it can be opened solemnly as scheduled, which can be reported to the people. (2) This year's National Games, due to insufficient funds and such a short preparation time, was able to have 52 units participating, and the people were so enthusiastic and excited, thanks to the efforts of the central government, the Shanghai municipal government, especially Mayor Wu. I am very grateful. (3) Today, people saw the return of compatriots from Taiwan, who had been liberated from their motherland, compatriots from the Northeast, who had been in the hands of the enemy for a long time, compatriots from border provinces such as Xinjiang and Xikang, and overseas Chinese, and felt very excited. (4) I hope that the country will be peaceful soon, and that the next National Games will have sufficient time and funding to be held better than this one.

The reporter then visited Mr. Zhang Boling, who expressed his feelings as follows: This National Games was able to open on time under such circumstances and lack of funds, which is not easy, and its significance is extremely important. This National Games was held after the national National Assembly, the election of the president, and the implementation of the new Constitution. The Chinese have always been weak, and sports can teach us to compete. Other competitions are for "power" and for "profit", while the sports meeting is for "name". On the other hand, the competition in the sports meeting is a competition with rules. Any competition must not violate the rules, and everyone must abide by the law. Today's conference is a concrete manifestation of building a democratic country and teaching people how to abide by the law. (Easy)

### China's National Games Village: Some Hope to Make a Sports Fortune

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Inside the venues of the National Games, fierce competitions are unfolding one after another. But have you ever taken a stroll outside the venues? The temporary shops and restaurants you see are like fortresses, each vying for attention and trying to outdo the others. Their energy is even more intense and exciting than what's happening in the arenas. If we were to call this area of mat sheds a "National Games Village," a makeshift version of the Olympic Village, it would be fitting. This "village," surrounding the back wall of the East Grandstand, forms a "Y" shape. Most of the restaurants are located on the two forks of the "Y," offering cold drinks and snacks. The cold drink stores are slightly more lavishly decorated. After all, a red Coca-Cola refrigerator or a yellow "Beauty" brand refrigerator gives them a head start in terms of style. It's unlike the temporary stoves made of several gasoline barrels stacked with lime, which ruin the aesthetic appeal right away. However, tastes vary. While customers are enjoying drinks at "Emerald Valley," "Old Songcheng" is equally popular, with loud orders for pork chops with double servings.

Businesses that have already opened are attracting customers. Cold drink stores are busy hiring trucks (costing 2.4 million yuan per trip) to replenish their stock constantly. While a storefront may only cost 30 to 40 million yuan, the goods inside are worth more than ten times that amount. Most owners estimate they will double their capital, hoping that Heaven will let them make a "sports fortune."

On the straight path is a warehouse of spiritual food, a "cultural street." Three-ply boards costing over 300,000 yuan each, fir wood costing nearly 20,000 yuan per foot, and enough paint to open a small paint shop, plus labor calculated at 2.5 yuan based on the cost-of-living index, decorate this street beautifully. Who would know that it is "painted on the outside, with mat sheds inside?" Each has its own beauty, each has its own charm. Like the two storefronts next door to our newspaper, we can honestly tell you the temperature, so you can decide whether to have ice or add clothing. We can also tell you the time, so you won't miss any exciting events.

There is also a fierce advertising war here. The billboards erected outside the sports venues, high and low like city walls, advertise cigarettes, newspapers, medicines, shoes and socks, banks, and even movie close-ups. Each 80-square-foot space costs 240 million yuan. It is said that after deducting costs, the advertising companies will give all the proceeds to the Games organizers. This is truly a considerable source of extra income. It is also said that a cigarette factory wanted to erect a cigarette can on the scoreboard, but the advertising company refused, saying it would affect the accounts distributed on both sides. More prominent advertisements are those of the Whirling Ball Club and Coca-Cola, one with bold strokes and the other with small horizontal advertisements around the basketball court, gymnasium, and swimming pool. Most of them share the idea of not seeking profit but hoping to build a brand. Excellent, excellent!

Turning to the vicinity of the main gate, a temporary dining hall is already piled with four geese, a pig, and boxes of yellow croaker. The staff are busy scaling the fish. A basket of old bamboo shoots is said to be for soup. On the north side, there is also a shop hidden behind the trees with an old card-style sign that reads, "Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Comfort and慰勞of Suppression-of-Rebellion Soldiers Tiger Stove." Now, it also sells water and coal, and offers meals. Friends who want to eat or drink can be introduced to these two affordable places.

The road outside the sports venue, which has been deserted for many years, now also seems "lively." The old proprietress of a noodle shop told me in a low voice: "I didn't have the money to set up a shop inside the venue, so I just renovated the original place. But even that cost over 50 million yuan." These people are truly seeking profit from small capital. They only hope that the spectators who can't get into the venue will patronize them.

The police bureau has unprecedentedly put up a signboard: "Lost, stolen, emergency? Report to the police service station immediately." Hopefully, this sign is just for show and won't be treated the same as those with business interests. (Education)

### National Games Briefs

The National Games General Affairs Section announces: The schedule for school and group visits on the 7th (tomorrow) has been arranged, including the list of schools and the number of people. Each school can bring a notification letter and purchase tickets at the Postal Savings Bureau at 36 Jiujiang Road one day before the scheduled date. The ticket price is 20,000 yuan per ticket. To provide dedicated service, the Postal Savings Bureau has also set up temporary business units inside the venue and at the Central Training Corps on Shuidian Road to handle savings, remittance, and mail collection services.

The National Games Medals Collection Team worked diligently yesterday, writing and painting. The trophies are inlaid with jade, exquisitely crafted, and full of splendor. Those who came to deliver the medals continued to stream in. Chu Chia-hua, President of the National Games, accompanied by Director Li of the Education Bureau, drove to the athletes' dormitory at the Central Training Corps at 5:30 PM yesterday and left after 7:00 PM.

The National Games General Affairs Section clarifies: A rumor has been spreading that the daily allowance for the staff of the various groups of the Games ranges from a minimum of 1 million yuan to a maximum of 4 million yuan, which is a misrepresentation. Due to financial difficulties, most of the staff are providing voluntary service. The heads of the groups only receive a transportation allowance of 6 million yuan once. The chief executives receive a monthly allowance of 4.5 million yuan for a limited period of two months. Assistant executives and temporary staff only receive an allowance of 2 million yuan for ten days.

### Head of Stall Vendors Loses His Gun and Finds It Again; The Fattest Man Gets Laughter from the Crowd

[Report from Our Newspaper] Traffic control is the most troublesome. Mayor Wu took the lead in demonstrating how to drive the car out of the venue, followed by broadcasts from police officers in jeeps and motorized bicycles, loudly urging them to drive out the black marketeers like driving away locusts from the venue.

Hawkers are everywhere, with hawkers selling sugared plums and vegetarian goose.

Insufficient power causes the lights to give off a yellow glow. Due to the remote location of the Southern restaurants behind the East Grandstand, business is slow, and all the ice bricks stored there have melted. To make matters worse, they petitioned the stall vendors section.

Today, the entrance will be through the West Gate to ensure even distribution of spectators and to protect the business of remote vendors.

Yesterday's temperature, according to the thermometer on our newspaper, was 66 degrees in the morning at 8:00 AM, 82.5 degrees at noon, and 80 degrees at 5:00 PM.

Our newspaper's photos attract countless viewers. Some see themselves in the picture and wave their hands. At one moment, the pigeon team arrives; at another moment, the flash news is posted; at another moment, the special press car arrives from Nanjing.

A price list inside the venue: Straw hats cost 180,000 yuan each, and tofu soup without shredded pork costs 50,000 yuan.

Li Shi-tseng's wife, with her plump figure, wore a green floral cheongsam in the morning and changed into a gray-based pink floral cheongsam in the afternoon, attracting attention. Wu Shao-shu wore dark glasses and the badge of the Standing Committee, strolling through the cultural street with his wife and daughter.

The fattest man in the entire venue is the motorcycle driver No. 2325 of the Yijing Militia Brigade in Songshan District. Guiding the torch into the venue, he was seen as a miracle, causing a roar of laughter.

The order was greatly disrupted in the afternoon, and resourceful cars entered the venue one after another, and a large number of vendors appeared to grab business.

Jin Ying-lin, the head of the stall vendors section, went to the Air Force Hostel to negotiate the reception of foreign guests, but was beaten up, with swollen cheeks and a missing badge. His personal gun was lost and recovered. Staff from the traffic control section angrily resigned, demanding Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan for guarantees.

The rent paid by stall vendors, as of yesterday, reached 5.3 billion yuan, more than double the original estimate. (Education)

### Squeeze! Push! Rush! Problems finally emerge! Railings collapse! 32 Men and women injured. Five ambulance teams dispatched.

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's National Games can only be described with one word: "crowded." And it was not just crowded; it was beyond the point of being crowded. Squeezing, pushing, and rushing went together, causing people to fall, bleed, break their arms, and faint. Some people cried out for their parents, and losing shoes was the least of their worries.

Before the Games opened at 3:00 PM, 14 people had already been carried to the Boy Scout ambulance team for emergency treatment. According to records, a total of 32 spectators were injured, with seven suffering more serious injuries and three sent to the hospital for treatment.

At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a section of railing on the right side of the East Grandstand suddenly broke, and over 200 spectators fell and jumped down. The first to fall was a fifth-grade student from Pei Ying Primary School named Hua Qingzhong (also known as Jianzhong). This 14-year-old boy couldn't withstand the squeeze, push, and rush of the crowd behind him, and the railing in front of him was not sturdy, so he fell with the broken railing, injuring his leg. After some first aid, he was sent to the Weidemei Road Police Hospital. Another person, Jia Yunsheng, broke his right forearm. The paramedics bandaged and suspended his right arm before sending him to the Municipal Hospital. Wang Yin suffered a contusion on his left leg and was sent to the Police Hospital. In addition, more than ten people suffered injuries to their waists, legs, and arms, including Dai Chuanliang, Peng Ji, Jiang Weiqing, Wang Dongfang, Wang Linsen, Tian Jianong, Wang Huanqin, and Gao Maoqing. Four or five of them were young children, but fortunately, their injuries were not serious.

Soon after, a section of railing on the left side of the West Grandstand also broke, and a section of railing on the North Grandstand also broke. Although 50 to 60 people rushed down in each incident, only one little girl, Wu Yingmei, suffered a concussion and was slightly unconscious, but she recovered after first aid.

After the three incidents, the people in the stands became vigilant, and no more accidents occurred. However, at 3:25 PM, while Mayor Wu was giving a speech on the West Grandstand, a large crowd suddenly rushed in from the gate below, causing chaos. The soldiers and police maintaining order could not stop them. In this chaotic situation, many people were pushed down, especially women and children. Several women tore their silk stockings, and blood streamed down their thighs.

As a result, most of the people who rushed in were escorted out by the soldiers and police, but a few managed to escape being expelled. When reporters asked them why they rushed in, they replied that they had bought tickets but had no way to get into the grandstand, so they had to rush towards the gate, and said that there were more than 2,000 people outside with tickets who couldn't get in.

These spectators who wanted to rush in and the soldiers and police who maintained order were in a stalemate for about half an hour. At 4:00 PM, they were all let in because they had spent 50,000 or 200,000 legal currency to buy tickets but could not get into the grandstand, which was already packed and could no longer accommodate them.

According to the Boy Scouts responsible for security and rescue, the railings were not sturdy and broke easily when squeezed. Moreover, there were many broken pieces of shrapnel on the walkways, making it easier to get injured. They collected more than 30 pieces of discarded shrapnel. As for those who had tickets but couldn't get in, it shouldn't be the responsibility of the ticket buyers.

Without the two accidents mentioned above, the order of yesterday's Games could have been much better, because the authorities dispatched a large number of soldiers and police to maintain order, and the arrangements were quite thorough, with people in every corner. The police bureau sent 150 mobile police officers, three companies of security police, 44 juvenile police officers, and the entire Criminal Investigation Section, plus female police officers, and the traffic brigade to maintain order outside the venue. The military police sent a guard company, and the garrison brigade also dispatched many personnel, plus 100 Boy Scouts.

Regarding the ambulance in the venue, there were five ambulance teams in the venue yesterday, staffed by 74 Boy Scouts and medical personnel. They did their best, but because there were too many "accidents," they seemed weak. At this rate, two or three more ambulance teams may be needed.

In addition, the volunteer fire brigade participated with nine units, dispatching seven vehicles and 60 firefighters to participate in the rescue work. (Gang)

### Preventing a Repeat of Tragedy: Rushing to Build Wire Mesh Frames

[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Games authorities, in view of the importance of maintaining order at the Games and the disorder among some spectators during yesterday's opening ceremony, during which a small part of the grandstand's cement railings were pushed down due to overcrowding, held a joint meeting last night with the leaders of the various groups responsible for security, traffic, venue, and ticketing to discuss improvement measures. After careful discussion, it was decided to strengthen security, delineate a restricted area, increase the entrances and exits of the grandstand, and rush to build 20 wire mesh frames to be placed at various important entrances and exits. If time permits, they will be used today to prevent the recurrence of spectators breaking down entrances. Closer coordination between the various groups is required.

### Rice Market Speculation Worsens; Authorities Decide on Stabilization Methods; Rice Prices Must Not Exceed Yesterday's Closing Price Starting Today

In light of the recent soaring grain prices in the city, Mayor Wu paid close attention to the situation. He inquired by telephone with the Chairman of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, Ren Xianqun, at 10:00 AM yesterday and contacted Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to exchange opinions. They decided on measures to stipulate that, starting from the 6th, all rice, flour, and oil prices must not exceed the closing prices of the 5th. If prices exceed this limit, the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee will supply rice, oil, and flour to the market without restrictions, it was announced.

The rice market speculation intensified yesterday. The price of Wuxi-produced rice rose sharply, and those holding goods became more reluctant to sell. The early and mid-day markets saw the tightest supply. The price of Bai Jing rice in the Southern market rose by 400,000 yuan, the price of Bo Dao rice jumped by 450,000 yuan, and the price of other Xian rice varieties also rose by 400,000 yuan. Near closing time, there was some high-altitude selling, and prices slightly retreated. The price of Bai Jing early rice and Xian rice each rose by 300,000 yuan in the Northern market. The price of Special High Jing reached 4.85 million yuan, Bai Jing traded at 4.75 million yuan, and Bai Yuan reached the 5 million yuan mark. By closing time, prices had also slightly recovered. Yesterday's arrivals totaled 5,894 stones.

As soon as the flour market opened, it rose to the limit. There were very few transactions in the market, and the prices quoted outside the market were chaotic. Lao Che and Bing Chuan were quoted as high as 1.65 million yuan each, and Hong Feng and Jian Cheng each traded at 1.6 million yuan. Later in the market, prices slightly recovered, with Lao Che and Bing Chuan each falling to 1.6 million yuan and Jian Cheng and Hong Feng also falling slightly, but still rising by about 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Bran was initially reluctant to open, but later, large bags traded at 1.05 million yuan. Wheat mill inventory increased by 200,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: Hankou rice initially rose to 2.4 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan, but prices were slightly stable later in the market. Corn also rose by more than 100,000 yuan. Picked Qing corn was in short supply and was quoted as high as 200,000 yuan, but no transactions were made. Red beans rose by 150,000 yuan. Lu beans were taken by both local and out-of-town merchants, rising by a staggering 300,000 yuan. Sand red beans were quoted at 5 million yuan, a rise of 300,000 yuan. Under the competition of out-of-town merchants, raw sesame kernels each rose by about 300,000 yuan.

Edible Oil: The sharp rise became more intense. Soybean oil initially opened at the 10 million yuan mark and then rose further to 10.2 million yuan under buying pressure, finally reaching 10.3 million yuan, a sharp increase of 700,000 yuan. The raw oil market was even more chaotic. Jiangbei Ji barrel raw oil opened at 11.8 million yuan and then rose to 12 million yuan. Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil rose to 12.5 million yuan, a sharp increase of 800,000 yuan. Small vehicle sesame oil rose by 1.5 million yuan, and soybean cake continued to rise by 50,000 yuan.

### The Focus of the Chinese Stock Market is on Buying. Yong Yarn Creates a New Price.

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market focused on buying Yong yarn. Buyers from the Guangdong business community and the financial community were present, reaching a new peak of 2610 yuan. However, the yarn and cloth market declined due to the poor performance of miscellaneous stocks. Tong Yi showed a certain amount of elasticity.

The morning opening was weak. It is possible that short-term treasury bonds will be listed. Yong yarn opened at a low of 2450 yuan. After the opening, it advanced to 2490 yuan. Some people unloaded, and the listed price did not change, retreating to 2460 yuan and then rising to 2540 yuan. The commission fee opened at 21 yuan and 24 yuan, retreating to 2505 yuan. The foreign stocks bought by the Xi business community were still popular, and they rose again to a new peak of 2546 yuan. Nos. 89 and others unloaded together, breaking the 2500 yuan mark. The yarn and cloth market began to decline slightly, and short positions closed out. Around noon, prices fell twice to a low of 2475 yuan. The afternoon closing was 2505 yuan, slightly higher than the previous closing for Tong Yi and Yong yarn. Da Tong was flat, and Mei Xin, Heng Feng, Zhong Fa, Mei Ya, Jing Lun, and Xin Hua fell by half a percent. The rest all fell slightly.

In the afternoon market, Yong yarn was first absorbed by the Guangdong business community. In addition, Nos. 76 and 186 also bought, rising to 2580 yuan. There were rumors that a certain buyer was being audited, and Nos. 157, 171, 160, 154, and 156 sold, once retreating below 2520 yuan. The National Bank's difference was not much. No. 171 made up for its strength after releasing stocks, and Nos. 169, 69, 52, and the Guangdong business community came in, and foreign stocks were again popular. Yong yarn then created a new peak of 2610 yuan. Only Tong Yi had the strength to revive, and there were few changes in the remaining stocks. No. 157 and others closed out, and the closing price was 2580 yuan. Compared with the morning closing, Yong Ye rose to the limit, and Mei Ya, Tong Yi, Rong Feng, Zhong Ni, Jing Lun, and Xin Yi each rose by half a percent. Heng Feng was flat, and the rest rose slightly. Unlisted stocks outside the market generally rose by half a percent to one percent.

### Foreign Stocks Rise Easily and Hard to Fall Back. Unified Bonds Rose Again Yesterday.

Yesterday, the foreign stocks were bought again by the silver money industry and foreign merchants. Although the Guangdong business community sold, the bottom was dry, and it was easy for prices to rise and hard for them to fall back. Rubber stocks and small stocks rose even more. Yi Yarn opened in the morning at 4.2 million yuan, and it ended around a new peak of 4.45 million yuan from 4.28 million yuan. Compared to the previous closing, telephone, tram, and cardboard each rose by 10%, and Yi Yarn, British Union, Huidfeng, Yi Beer, Steel, Natural Friend, and Rubber stocks each rose by a strong half a percent. Ye Guang and Shipping rose slightly by less than half a percent.

Government bonds rose again yesterday. Unified C opened in the morning at 160,000 yuan and closed at 180,000 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, A and B each rose by 18,000, C rose by 28,000, and D and E rose by about 20,000. The transaction volume was about 6 million.

### Internal Exchange Rate Adjustment

[Report from Our Newspaper] The exchange rate from Shanghai's four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury to various places will be slightly changed starting today. An excerpt is as follows: Guangdong District: Guangzhou charges 100 yuan per thousand yuan (previously 70 yuan), Shantou and Haikou charge 120 yuan (previously 90 yuan), other places charge 110 yuan (previously 80 yuan); Guangxi District: Wuzhou, Liuzhou, and Nanning are all changed to 80 yuan (previously 60 yuan); Hunan District: Hengyang 40 yuan (previously 20 yuan); Jiangxi District: Ji'an and Ganzhou are changed to 50 yuan (previously 40 yuan); Sichuan District: Yu Rong is changed to 10 yuan (previously 15 yuan); Guizhou and Yunnan are changed to 20 yuan (previously 30 yuan); Shaanxi is changed to 10 yuan (previously 15 yuan).

### Silk Continues to Rise

The price of rayon in the market rose slightly yesterday. The most active "Asahi" yarn of No. 120 opened at around 334 million yuan in the morning. The largest spot was 37 million yuan, and the next day was 40 million yuan. The next day's closing was 37 million yuan in the afternoon. There was no fluctuation and the closing price was the same as in the morning, resulting in a 5 million yuan increase from the previous day.

Factory Silk: The market rose yesterday. D-grade silk opened at 450 million yuan, while the "Shun Feng" brand, which is less expensive, opened at 440 million yuan. In the afternoon, "Temple of Heaven" silk traded at 50 million yuan. Hua Fu Company threw out ten packages of goods for 440 million yuan. Export channels for factory silk remain stagnant, and market prices also rose by 5 million to 10 million yuan.

Silk Fabrics: The market continued to prosper yesterday. The opening price for Huaqiang's silk quilt cover was 169 million yuan. The largest next-day transaction was over 72.5 million yuan, and the closing prices for spot and next-day transactions were 70.9 million yuan and 180 million yuan, respectively. The price of Dachen's checkered silk crepe was 580,000 yuan at first, and the closing price was around 575,000 yuan.

### Yarn Prices Fall, Cloth Prices Rise

In the cotton yarn market yesterday, the morning opening continued because of the strong buying interest from all sides. The high price of 42 count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was called 278 million yuan. Since the buying interest was turning sluggish, most of the yarn industry in this street was waiting and seeing. Before long, short sellers seized the opportunity to move, and Fangjian suddenly hung up a sign to accept applications, and the market suddenly collapsed, closing at 270 million yuan, a drop of 4 million yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 21 count Shuangma yarn was firm at first and then tired, eventually falling by 1 million yuan. The prices of all other coarse and fine yarns also fell.

In the cotton cloth market yesterday, although actual sales were rare, the trading in the market was very lively. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth rose all the way from 5.44 million yuan to 6.66 million yuan. Afterwards, because people in the industry thought that the price was too high, they competed to sell each other. The profit-taking of floating households, which reduced prices, ended at 5.63 million yuan, a rise of 180,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of Wufu Caiqiu, Lanji, and other fine cloths all rose by 150,000 to 223,000 yuan. Biji Zhigong's transactions were lively, and the price continued to rise by about 300,000 yuan. The rising momentum of other bleached cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth was also very strong. The final transaction for Longtou fine cloth, for delivery tomorrow, was 5.54 million yuan, and there were few buyers.

Spot Cotton Soars: In the spot cotton market yesterday, quotations rose madly. Supply was scarce, and the chips in the market were suddenly exhausted. As a result, transactions were interrupted, and only one batch of Guide Shuang Huanghua was traded, priced at 20.9 million. Zhoupu Zi Hua 5.19 million to 5.5 million.

Yarn and Cloth Transported to the South: [Report from Our Newspaper] After the ban on transporting cotton yarn and cotton cloth to the south was lifted, a large amount of yarn and cloth has been transported to Guangdong in recent days. The Hai Zhou Wheel transported 5,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 7,000 pieces of cotton cloth to Guangdong the day before yesterday. The Han Min Wheel is scheduled to sail to Guangzhou on Saturday, and the amount of cotton yarn reported to be loaded is already over 3,000 pieces, and cotton cloth is over 7,000 pieces. During the period when the transport to the south was prohibited, the yarn and cloth transported to Guangdong were transported to Wuhan by Jiang Wheel and then transferred to the Yuehan Wheel. Now it has been changed to direct sea transport to Guangzhou, so the amount of yarn and cloth transported to Wuhan by Jiang Wheel has greatly decreased.

### Changing the Allocation Method of Goods Obtained Through Barter with Japan by China Trust Bureau

[Our Dispatch] It has come to our attention that in the past, the China Trust Bureau (中信局) often allocated goods obtained through barter trade with Japan to various government agencies based on official exchange rates, resulting in substantial losses. This created a significant overdraft in the barter accounts, leading to difficulties in expanding the business. This year, the Bureau is changing its approach, requiring agencies receiving goods to exchange them for materials of equal value. The first such transaction has already been completed, with the Kaiyuan Coal Mine (開澯煤礦) exchanging 10,000 tons of coal dust with the China Trust Bureau for Japanese dynamite and parts of equivalent value. The mine has also requested the China Trust Bureau to continue supplying 3 million pit props (窰木), offering coal as payment. The negotiated price for the coal is $18 USD per ton (F.O.B. Qingdao). The price of the Japanese pit props is still under discussion, with the Japanese side initially asking $4.05 USD per large bundle, while the Chinese side hopes to settle at $3.55 USD. In addition, the Huainan Coal Mine (淮南煤礦) has requested 800,000 pit props in exchange for their coal, and the East China Coal Mine (華東煤礦) has requested 500,000 pit props, also offering their coal as payment.

### Replicated Chunmee Tea for Export to Be Available Soon

Yesterday, the foreign tea market was calm. Although exporters and goods owners negotiated, both sides were persistent, so the market was quiet. According to people in the industry, this year's Wenzhou (溫州) new stir-fried green tea, since its appearance a few days ago, is currently being replicated by companies into export styles like Chunmee (珍眉). They are expected to be manufactured and available for market distribution within days. However, given the high cost of procurement, the asking prices are bound to be very high. As for tea for domestic sales, sales in Tianjin (津帮) remain stagnant, while sales in other regions are still continuous, so the situation is not bleak. Regarding prices, old tea with empty inventories continues to hover at a high level. As for this year's new Longjing (龍井), Huangtang (黃湯), and Biluochun (碧螺春), the market atmosphere has been hard to maintain because they are not as fresh and tender as the previous batches.

### Sugar Prices Rise Endlessly

Yesterday, the sugar market, after an initial period of calmness, tightened as sales to the north were very active, making any easing of prices difficult to foresee in the short term. Furthermore, certain rumors further stimulated the rise, so the market felt even more intense at the end. The highest difference in the Guild's (公會) price range reached 500,000 yuan, while the smaller fluctuations were still around 100,000 yuan. As a result, the price of No. 19 raw sugar spot (現貨) increased by over 6%, the price of No. 200 raw sugar spot decreased by slightly less than 3%, the price of four-and-a-half bag sugar increased by 4%, and the rise in bag sugar was similar. No. 200 refined medium sugar (中砂白) increased by 5%, Peruvian raw sugar (比魯砠) increased by 21% compared to one week ago, and the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar (台幣) increased by 12 yuan, reaching 268 yuan.

The rise in native sugar (土糖) prices was more moderate. Shantou (汕提) green sugar rose from 4.7 million yuan to 4.8 million yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan. Cotton red (棉赤) was at 4.9 million yuan, with about 200 bags traded. Xinghua (興化) white sugar was at 7.23 million yuan, and Xinghua red high-quality sugar was at 5.1 million yuan, with several hundred pieces traded. Diao green (刁靑) was at 4.15 million yuan, with 300-400 bags traded, with prices later increasing. Miscellaneous red (什路赤) was at 4.45 million yuan, and its momentum suggests further upward potential if there are no unexpected obstacles.

### Citizen and Government

— Chu Yukun (儲玉坤)

(The Citizen and Government, by John A. Hawgood Nicholson & Watson, London, 1947. 128 pages, actual price 6 shillings.)

This book is one of the "New Democracy Series" edited by Mr. Edwards. In his introduction, he states, "A hundred years ago, humanity sacrificed millions of lives for the sake of democracy. Although the struggle resulted in complete victory, allowing democracy to spread throughout the world, the ideals were shattered, and the passion disappeared. This phenomenon must not be allowed to repeat itself. We have once again emerged victorious in the Second World War. At this moment, democracy must win the peace.

"We believe that the main reason the peace negotiators of 1919 lost the peace for democracy was that they did not clearly understand the basic principles of democracy and its outward forms. Now that we have paid a heavy price for their mistakes, we must find a way to adapt 19th-century democracy to the circumstances of the 20th century. We must acknowledge that the progress of science, coupled with the stimulus of 'total war,' has created many new possibilities and new social organizations, revolutionizing human society. Only democracy can become a dynamic force, utilizing all new discoveries and technologies to ensure that humanity no longer has unemployment and that society no longer experiences unease or need, paving a new frontier for human life and freedom. Only then can democracy survive in this world. This task cannot be entirely delegated to politicians and experts but should be undertaken by every citizen. The essence of a democratic country lies in the fact that every citizen can participate in the decision-making of tasks." From this, we can also see the purpose of Mr. Edwards' editing of the New Democracy Series.

The author of this book, Mr. Hawgood, is a professor of political history at the University of Birmingham, who has specialized in public administration in various European and American countries. He has conducted in-depth research on administrative methods and is considered an authority in the United Kingdom. According to his article to the readers, this book was originally co-authored by the author and Mr. Owen. However, due to Mr. Owen's employment in the United Nations and his busy schedule, the author completed it alone. Chapter 4, "Industrial Democracy," was co-authored with Mr. Edwards, the editor of the "New Democracy Series."

At a time when political democratization is just beginning in our country, I believe that this booklet is worth introducing to readers. Because at present, the common people still do not feel very interested in politics. Although the National Assembly representatives and legislators are all elected by the people, voter turnout is not enthusiastic. Some elected National Assembly representatives or legislators do not know what representation means. Some even think that becoming a National Assembly representative means becoming a high-ranking official who can act recklessly. We have seen a National Assembly representative punch and injure a National Assembly staff member, and we are truly worried about the democratic politics of our country! In addition, there is another phenomenon in the country. We often see cries for "democracy, democracy" in newspapers and magazines, but we rarely see discussions on democratic theory. I want to advise domestic political scholars that it is better to write more books on democracy than to loudly chant democracy, especially to publish more popular booklets, which can become popular in the country and awaken the political awareness of the general public.

The content of this book is simple and clear, divided into seven chapters, and a brief introduction is as follows: (1) Several questions about citizens explain that citizens in modern democratic countries should adopt various methods to influence national legislation, policy decisions, and national administration. Therefore, the author says in a positive tone that citizens are not enough to exert the spirit of democratic politics by voting alone. However, the author collected many illustrations to illustrate the people's struggle for the right to vote. (2) Parliamentary democracy explains the British member selection method. Although it was modified in 1944, it is largely the same as before the war. The author records that members of the British House of Commons have three different identities: 1. Local representatives; 2. National representatives; 3. Representatives of a certain sector. (3) Local democratic government first explains the reforms of the 19th century and the needs of the 20th century. Taking the local governments of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany as examples, it is believed that reforms are needed in terms of organization. Secondly, the status of elected senators is explained. Finally, the special problems of rural societies are listed.

The fourth chapter on industrial democracy begins by saying that the British Trades Union Congress today has eight million members, making it the largest force in the United Kingdom. The internal organization is completely democratic, like politics. It also decides work rules and elects executive committee members through meetings and voting. At the same time, there is also a judicial-like system for resolving internal disputes, and every worker is responsible for the Trades Union Congress. Chapter 6, Testing Public Opinion, can be studied in terms of technology. In 1940, the United Kingdom established the Wartime Social Survey Committee to investigate the public opinion of the war at any time. The United States and France also have public opinion research organizations. The British Institute of Public Opinion is a private organization, but it has made a great contribution to promoting democracy.

The last chapter is the education of citizens. The author believes that education should be universal throughout the country. In addition to formal elementary schools, middle schools, and universities that should be spread all over the country, other forms of civic education should be actively carried out. For example, the establishment of newspaper reading rooms and the holding of youth parliamentary meetings should not be ignored. Finally, the author also raises a big question, namely, "Citizens and the World." He believes that citizens of a democratic country also have a very close relationship with the consequences of their foreign policy. For example, the issue of peace and war is a matter of life and death, honor and disgrace, and joy and sorrow for him. Therefore, civic education should include a lot of information about foreign countries and their relationship with the United Kingdom. Although the British Broadcasting Corporation has done its best, democratic countries need more international knowledge. This suggestion is most worthy of our attention.

### China's Economy in the Past Fifty Years

— Tian Chunyin (田春蔭)

China Commercial Bank's Fiftieth Anniversary Commemorative Album, edited by China Commercial Bank

Printed on April 25, 1947, 270 pages, not for sale

In recent years, the importance of the economy has become increasingly prominent. Among those who have made contributions to the rise of new industries in our country over the past few decades, the banking industry is undoubtedly the leader, regardless of its merits and demerits to society. The achievements of its advocacy of economic research, whether monographs or periodicals, have been demonstrated by the banking industry in the past ten years or so, making it the most convenient and abundant source of information for those studying modern history.

This album can also be regarded as one of these achievements. - This kind of commemoration in the form of written research is especially worthy of praise in China. - The bank published this album to commemorate its 50th anniversary. It inevitably has some commendations to the bank, such as the first article by Mr. Du Yuesheng (社月笙), "China Commercial Bank in the Past Fifty Years", and the appendix "Chronicle of Major Financial and Economic Events in China in the Past Fifty Years", which also uses the bank as a starting point and ending point, belonging to the achievements of a bank. However, it still has reference value for people who generally and specifically discuss the economy, because although the content is written by many people, the weight and viewpoints may not be consistent, but the writers are all experts and based on many data, which is not without merit. Mr. Zhang Shizhao (章士釗)'s "Commemorative Remarks" made some remarks about Sheng Xuanhuai (盛宜懷), the founder of the bank, in which he said: "On the day of the revolution, Duke Sheng shouldered the heavy burden of the world by advocating the nationalization of railways. In fact, the articles at that time were very comprehensive in terms of caring for merchants' capital. Once this plan was abandoned, the Sichuan-Guangdong-Hankou Railway has not been completed to this day. The loans borrowed by the Luhan Railway had already been repaid as agreed, and it was not as Chen of the students who stayed abroad said. If the entire railway had been collected from the United States, the three provinces would have been connected more than thirty years ago, and what would the people's livelihood have relied on? Now that we discuss success or failure after the fact, almost all can see Duke Sheng's loyalty to planning for the country and his courage to bear resentment. Even the most radical scholars will not be able to change these words." It is a very objective argument. Although Duke Sheng is not enough to be called a great statesman, today's great statesmen can be said to be worthy of praising the spirit of "bearing resentment" for the sake of the country. In the Qing Dynasty, this kind of spirit was especially evident in Zeng Guofan (曾國藩) and Li Hongzhang (李鴻章), but now it gives people a feeling of almost stopping. The so-called "new politicians" take catering to the world as the standard of action. It is naturally due to the temporary gain and loss, but also because the foundation of learning and knowledge is not deep. The world follows the trend, whether it is words or deeds, and there is nowhere to see the traces of "impulsiveness", which is really a sad place. According to the "Sheng Yuzhai Manuscripts and Travel Diary to the East" published by Beijing Xiugengtang in 1942, Duke Sheng has experienced shipping, mining and other affairs for more than 40 years. All the manuscripts he has stored are important historical materials for examining the political, economic, transportation and diplomatic aspects of the late Qing Dynasty, and can be used to discuss Duke Sheng in detail.

In addition to the above-mentioned articles by Du and Zhang, this album includes Song Hanzhang's (宋漢章) "Evolution of Chinese Finance in the Past Fifty Years", Chen Guangfu's (陳光甫) "Chinese Finance in the Past Fifty Years", Yang Yinpu's (楊蔭溥) "Chinese Banking Industry in the Past Fifty Years", Qin Runqing's (秦潤卿) "Shanghai's Money Shop Industry in the Past Fifty Years", Huang Bingwei's (黃秉維) "Chinese Industry and Mining Industry in the Past Fifty Years", Shou Jingwei's (壽景偉) "Chinese International Trade in the Past Fifty Years", Wang Xiaowen's (王效文) "Chinese Insurance Industry in the Past Fifty Years", Zhang Baiyi's (張白衣) "Chinese Trust Business in the Past Twenty-six Years", and Luo Qinghua's (駱淸華) "Chinese Economy in the Past Fifty Years". There are many repetitions in the discussion, which is an unavoidable phenomenon of writing by many people. Among them, the articles of Yang, Qin, Huang, and Shou have reference value. Although they are not for sale, they are not difficult to see because they are given as gifts to public and private institutions. Therefore, this article is specially introduced to tell people in China who are studying the history of finance and economy in recent decades.

"Record of a Besieged City (危城記)" was successively published in Shen Bao and became one of my daily must-read courses; after this book was typeset and published, I read it again. I have a kind of partiality for this book, because the background selected in this book happens to be the occasion I personally experienced, so I feel especially kind and tasteful.

The author of this book, Qin Shouou (秦瘦鷗), is also a familiar writer. He has written many books in the past, especially the publication of "Begonia (秋海棠)", which gained a wide readership six years ago and was put on the stage, creating a performance record. However, "Record of a Besieged City" has made great progress compared to before in terms of writing skills, application of techniques, and processing of materials. It is natural to be happy to have such a book published in today's era of general decline in purchasing power, but how many readers have the spare energy to purchase and collect it? This is a question.

### After Reading "Record of a Besieged City"

— Hu Hanjun (胡漢君)

Written by Qin Shouou, published by Huaizheng Culture Press (懷正文化社)

In fact, "Record of a Besieged City" is not just a novel, it is actually a chapter in a history that faithfully records the great tragedy of the late Anti-Japanese War. From this book, readers can not only get a glimpse of the outline of this stage, but also see through the inside story of the general institutions at that time being out of touch with the Anti-Japanese War. In these 250 pages of paper, the author can try his best to grasp and expose the essence of those lewd and inferior bodies wrapped in beautiful coats. In these 250 pages of paper, the author can absorb and digest many real faces of various types in this paragraph, and clearly depict them into an entire book surface, exhibited in front of us, and these faces are all characters we usually come into contact with and are familiar with, whether it is Associate Manager Zhu or Section Chief Xiong, movie queen Mrs. Pan or Xiao Shen, Xu Shaoming or the General Manager's wife. Not only a few years ago, even now, we can see it at any time and any corner. The author's arrangement of these actors is not exaggerated and Xuanran, so we feel kind and real because of its appropriateness. This should be said to be the author's greatest success.

In this book, the author also issued a warning to those who are in the Anti-Japanese War camp but forget their responsibilities (we may all be included): "The enemy is about to attack! Who will resist? How to resist? What should we do if they chase us again?"? When we recall the chaos in the rear during the Xiang-Gui Battle and the various situations where they never thought about how to strengthen the battle, but only made plans to escape, it is no wonder that the author finally intolerably dissected the lungs of these defeatists without mercy: "It seems that the Anti-Japanese War is completely someone else's business, they only care about one thing - escape!" We should really blush with each other.

The author has personally seen and participated in the performance of this great tragedy, so he sees the rear of the Anti-Japanese War quite clearly. In fact, how many people really did their best for the Anti-Japanese War in the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War? Whether in the front or rear, I really don't know how many people just used this sacred banner as a cover for their own promotion or wealth. This sudden disaster just served as a demon mirror, revealing the true faces of various people. The author can very well execute this task.

But the author is also a very emotional person after all, so after recording these phenomena, he finally sighed sadly: "That is really a dangerous city? It should be said that the "City of Fools" is more worthy of its name." How many are not fools at present?

In this book, the author also used Zhu Zhaonian's mouth to criticize the government system and bureaucratic style at that time. He roared: "Official affairs! Official affairs! So many people in the whole China are handling official affairs every day, and only then have they reached this day! If such official affairs continue to be handled, China will perish!" What a painful cry? In fact, is it only the Anti-Japanese War period that was like this? Now it is victory, and it has been transformed into a period of suppression of rebellion. Those bloody lessons in the past have not promoted and changed this kind of government system and bureaucratic style. Although "Record of a Besieged City" was completed two years ago, it is still a fresh book to read today. And I firmly believe that if things go on like this, even after ten years, there will be no promotion and change, then this book will become a fresh book for a long time. Isn't it sad?

### The Symbol of the Torch

— Jingwen (靖文)

When this article is published, the torch relay starting from the gate of the Presidential Palace in the capital must have reached its Shanghai destination, and the 7th National Games must be in full swing.

The torch of course symbolizes the light, enthusiasm, courage, and wisdom of life, in a word, it also symbolizes Sportsmanship. Prometheus in Greek mythology was the first warrior to steal fire from the sky to the world. Although he suffered the pain of punishment, he can be said to be the first torch relay runner in the world. Although this is a myth, in terms of the development history of human civilization, fire is undoubtedly the origin and driving force of human civilization. Historians have divided human civilization into various eras such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Electrical Age based on the main living tools of human beings, but fire has always been the basic driving force of all ages. Even in the current stage when human civilization is about to enter the atomic age, it is difficult to imagine that human civilization can be separated from the relationship with fire from now on.

Fire symbolizes light and heat, which needs no further explanation. The life source of all living things in our world is fire, because the sun itself is a ball of fire and heat. As for fire being a symbol of wisdom, it is because wisdom must contain light and heat. Wisdom enlightens idiocy, and light drives away darkness. If there is no fire in people's hearts and no light in the world, what hope is there for human life!

However, fire is also considered to be the most terrible thing. A single spark can start a prairie fire, and the losses caused by fires around the world every year are incalculable. And the most terrible thing is the fire of war. The same is a spark. In the hands of the god of wisdom, Prometheus, it symbolizes light and wisdom, but in the hands of the god of war, Mars, it symbolizes darkness and destruction. The hell in the mouth of religious people is a sea of fire, but it is completely destructive fire, and it is fire that destroys humanity.

People have such different views on fire, not because fire is really different, but because of the different ways people deal with fire. Fire is a kind of power. Only when people know how to use this power well, fire is a kind of good and bright power. Otherwise, playing with fire will burn you. There is a clear warning in ancient times that fire cannot be played with!

This time the National Games gathered athletes from all over the country in one hall. They can all be said to be the fire of our nation. There are many young people from remote provinces and overseas Chinese, who are still visiting the heart of the motherland for the first time. I believe that they must have the same enthusiasm and hope for the motherland as fire. Whether or not to win the championship is a secondary issue. What is important is how to make these young men and women who come with enthusiasm be able to take a good impression of the motherland back.

Although the motherland is currently in a war, this National Games is not an embellishment to whitewash peace, because the participation of athletes from all over the country this time is out of spontaneous enthusiasm. Many athletes have stated that they are not thinking about winning the championship this time, because whoever the championship belongs to is the same glory, which is slightly different from the meaning of the World Games. The main purpose of their long journey this time is to want to get closer to the motherland and learn more about the motherland. It is really touching that young people from remote provinces and overseas Chinese have such eager love for the motherland.

If the young people of China have eager love for the country, China will always have hope. Although some foreigners regard the current China as already in incurable chaos, for example, the "World Travel and Trade Guide" recently published by the New York Herald Tribune has listed China as a "problem area". But as long as every young person in China believes that his motherland has hope, then the temporary impressions of outsiders are not worth caring about.

The National Games can gather thousands of young people from all over the country in one hall, which tells the world: Although China is currently in chaos, it seems that Chinese young people are always inseparably connected to the motherland in spirit, and they always have the same enthusiasm for the motherland as fire. Even if domestic transportation is frequently destroyed, they still come from thousands of miles away. It can be said that the scale is not as good as the World Games held in London, but the meaning it expresses is fundamentally different from the World Games that completely wants to attract foreign tourists and thereby wants to absorb foreign exchange.

The torch relay starting from the gate of the Presidential Palace in the capital is in the form of transmitting a message, but in fact it implies that a new bright torch will ignite the fire in the hearts of every people. From the unity of the youth of the whole country, we will further achieve the peace and unity of China! At least I personally hope so.

### Arc de Triomphe

— Xu Ren (許人)

"Arc de Triomphe (凱旋門)" by Remarque, the author of "All Quiet on the Western Front", is one of the best literary works of the year. It has recently been translated by Zhu Wen (朱雯) and published by Culture and Life Publishing House (文化生活出版社). Now, I will briefly quote some of the quotable good sentences from it.

Describing stateless exiles: "They don't know where to go, but the next morning, before you wake up, they have already left. At that time, they knew where to go."

On women: "Women in the world, if they are not abandoned, they should be respected. There is no middle ground."

On life and death: "Living things can move - they have strength, demeanor, and absurdity - but they will not have the strange solemnity that those things that can never move again and will only rot have. Only complete things will have this characteristic: and humans can only achieve completion in death - and time is also very short."

About character: "Cynics often have noble character, while idealists tend to be unreliable."

I have tasted books, especially literary masterpieces, are like a famous dish. You must taste them yourself before you can know their merits, because they also have the three conditions of color, fragrance, and taste. The introducer can only describe its color and fragrance at most. If you want to know its taste, you cannot taste it on behalf of others.

### Zhao Gu Ni

— Qian Dacheng

In recent times, many calligraphers in the Jiangnan region favored imitating Weng Tonghe, the Grand Secretary. However, Zhao Gu Ni of Changshu was the foremost in capturing the essence of his style and being able to create genuine likenesses. Gu Ni, named Shi, styled himself Shi Nong, and also went by the sobriquet Ni Daoren. He was a native of Xitang Town. In his youth, he followed his father selling medicine in the village of Jincun County. There were medical skill contests in the village, and those who ranked high would receive prize money. Those who ranked last were given a picul of vegetable oil, encouraging them to burn the midnight oil and diligently practice, which was essentially intended as mockery. Most who ranked last were filled with shame and indignation and would often refuse to take the oil. Gu Ni initially participated in the contest and ended up in last place. He carried home the picul of vegetable oil, ignoring the mockery of the crowd. Several months later, he participated again and won first place, surprising everyone. A tofu shop owner in the neighborhood smiled and said to the crowd, "This young man didn't succeed by luck! Every night, when I get up to grind tofu, I see a light shining in his house. Looking in, I see him practicing calligraphy. He is so diligent and self-motivated; how could he not succeed?" The crowd then sighed in admiration.

At that time, there was a madman named Jin in Jincun who was skilled in seal carving. Gu Ni asked him to carve a stone seal, but Jin scolded him, saying, "You want me to carve seals for you?" Gu Ni was indignant and learned seal carving from Jin Youzhu Yi, and his reputation gradually increased. Later, he went to the home of Shen Shiyou in the city (Shiyou's name was Rujin; he specialized in collecting antique inkstones, was skilled in poetry, and authored the "Ming Jian Bai Zhai Poetry Collection"). Shiyou was close friends with Wu Changshuo. Changshuo occasionally visited Changshu, and Gu Ni was able to study under Changshuo, becoming even more skilled in engraving and mastering calligraphy, painting, porcelain, bronze, jade, and stone. At that time, Grand Secretary Weng Tonghe had been dismissed from his post and was living at home, not associating with gentry officials, but only interacting with commoners. Gu Ni often visited him and gained the Grand Secretary's favor, studying the Grand Secretary's calligraphy style and sometimes even writing for him. As the Grand Secretary was dying, he gave Gu Ni two of his personal seals, indicating his intention to pass on his legacy. Gu Ni's imitations of Weng's calligraphy spread throughout Jiangnan, becoming indistinguishable from the original. Once his reputation was established, he no longer did it. The Weng calligraphy imitations of others were merely clumsy scribbles.

In his later years, Gu Ni's reputation increased. High-ranking officials and nobles would ask him to carve seals, and he would haggle over every penny, never catering to their desires. He was trustworthy and dependable with commoners, keeping his word and honoring his commitments. He was willing to spend a thousand gold pieces for them. He was particularly close to Mr. Yang Wuyi of the same town. They once went together to the Xiyuan Temple in Suzhou. Many weeping willows grew by the temple, and the two of them stood listening to the singing of orioles all day. Others laughed at their obsession, but they did not care.

Gu Ni had a beautiful beard and a dignified appearance. He liked to scold people, and no one dared to argue with him. Mr. Yu Youren of Sanyuan visited Yushan and called on Gu Ni. They sipped tea together at Xiaoyao You (a teahouse in Changshu, now a hospital), and the two sat facing each other, their appearances so similar that people looked at them as if they were immortals.

Gu Ni had an extremely eccentric personality. When he had malaria, the doctor told him to avoid certain foods, but he would eat those foods anyway and refuse to take medicine, so his illness worsened. He summoned relatives and friends to bid farewell, asked someone to write his epitaph and eulogy, eager to see them before he died. He built his tomb on the western slope of Yushan, calling it "Jinshi Kan," after his wife's surname, Jin. He left instructions for a simple funeral, with only a three-inch-thick paulownia coffin. His family was able to follow his instructions. He had no sons, but his daughter, Lin, was able to carry on his legacy. (Editor's note: The daughter of Mr. Gu Ni is skilled in calligraphy and married the son of the famous calligrapher Xiao Tuiguan.) Gu Ni once said to her, "All miscellaneous skills must have books in your heart. Only with books can you approach the ancients... The method of imitating seals is easily obtained by seeking knowledge from inscriptions and seal scripts. It is difficult to succeed by merely buying tools. After the Six Dynasties, although seal scripts were skillfully crafted, they were often too graceful and could not be incorporated into seals. When Deng Wanbai created seals, his white-character seals did not go beyond the boundaries of the Han dynasty; he was good at about fifteen or sixteen of them. His red-character seals were more original, but too graceful; he was good at about twelve or thirteen of them. My seals cannot be like Wu Changshuo's, who learned nothing but the ancients, thus becoming a master of his generation..." His words are like this, not only discussing seal carving, but also revealing his character.

### Music

— Ruzi

Music is not only for entertainment, but it is also a medicine. Relaxing music encourages people to work harder, surpassing all good medicine.

The famous French psychiatrist Esquirol said, "Music has a very significant effect on the human body and mind. I often use it in the treatment of mental illnesses. It can soothe patients, calm their minds, and it is a most powerful therapeutic factor, not to be easily ignored."

Whenever British statesman Gladstone felt tired, he would ask someone to sing his favorite songs. When philosopher Spencer felt nerve pain, he would lie quietly and listen to relaxing music, and the pain would often be relieved.

### After Writing a Ten-Foot-Tall Cursive Script Couplet "Mount the Horse to Strike the Bandit, Dismount to Write Proclamations, Hold a Crab in the Left Hand, Hold a Wine Cup in the Right," a Playful Quatrain

— Bai Jiao

The maid worries about the ink, I'm sad to strike the ink,
My wrist moves divinely, unaware of fatigue.
Wanting to despise the orthodox way to the world,
Which noble family would allow such lofty pride?

Plowing and hunting year after year, guarding the inkstone field,
A bald head in Dazhong sleeps poorly.
A rotten heart remains beyond frost-covered hair,
Warm sunshine on the Jiangnan in the fourth month.

This meaning needs no further discussion,
A spiritual root not suited to sprout at the gate.
The master lies planning a mountain tour,
Carelessly adding moss to complement bamboo shoots.

Advise you not to speak your true feelings,
Wine is in the clear goblet, the moon is in the pavilion.
The recluse cultivates fragrance, the monk enjoys tranquility,
Suddenly seeing the spring blooming all at once. (Written for Professor Jin Banguang, the Venerable Monk, a small scroll better than a quatrain)

Burning paper, calling smoke with a yawn and stretch,
No plan to move mountains, only wine as a friend.
The clear essence of the universe has always been here,
Drunken hair in the Xiang River, spring under the brush.

### The Story of Solar Eclipses

— Yalong

"In the ninth month, at the beginning of the moon, the sun did not meet in Fang. The officers beat the drums, the officials ran, and the astronomers of the Xi and He clans neglected their duties, knowing nothing, and caused darkness in the sky, offending the kings of the past. The law says: those who predict too early shall be killed without mercy, and those who predict too late shall be killed without mercy." This is the earliest record of a solar eclipse in our country, recorded in the Book of Documents. The Xi and He clans were the two major clans that specialized in astronomy during the Tang, Yu, and Xia dynasties. They were very knowledgeable in astronomy. However, during the reign of Zhongkang of the Xia dynasty, they failed to fulfill their duties and did not predict the date of this solar eclipse in advance, causing panic among the people of the country. Some beat drums, some shot arrows, trying to save the sun. Later, those two "derelict" astronomers were sentenced to death, because according to the law at that time, those who predicted too late or too early were to be punished by death. It can be seen that the study of astronomy at that time had already achieved considerable success.

In a place called Rietvlei in South Africa, there was a total solar eclipse. Afterward, the miners demanded double pay from the mine owners, arguing that they had worked for two days, even though the night in between was very short. In the end, they were victorious.

Thales, the astronomer who was the first of the Seven Sages of ancient Greece, once used a solar eclipse to resolve a war. In 585 BC, the Medes and Lydians had been at war for several years without a victor. Thales predicted that there would be a solar eclipse, and announced to both armies, "Heaven is tired of war and will display a solar eclipse to warn everyone." Later, when the two sides were fiercely fighting, the daytime suddenly turned into night. The soldiers on both sides then believed that Heaven was truly tired of war and made peace.

In 310 BC, the Sicilian people were being chased by the Carthaginians. Their leader, Agathocles, took sixty warships and fled to the sea that night. At dawn, there was a solar eclipse, the light disappeared again, and the stars reappeared. Agathocles announced to his subordinates, "The solar eclipse is a sign of change, a symbol of our turning defeat into victory." The crowd believed him, and morale was restored. Six days later, the Sicilian banners were planted on Carthaginian land.

### Infant

— Li Li

An infant's first cry after birth allows it to inhale its first breath of air. The inhalation of oxygen causes the skin to change from a pale grey to a pale red.

An infant can only feed on breast milk three days after birth.

At one month old, an infant's eyes begin to converge.

Infants do not produce tears within the first three months of their lives.

### Urging People to Stop Spitting

— Tan Ke

On the utility poles by the roadside, there are white signs with black characters that say, "Spitting harms people and spreads tuberculosis." But if you stroll along the street, you will encounter people leisurely spitting wherever they please.

It seems that someone once said that our Chinese people's attitude towards things is mostly casual. When their heart leads them, they can't care about anything else. Although they know that spitting harms people, when phlegm is in their throat, they must spit it out. The arrival of phlegm is not restricted by time or space, so they spit whenever it comes, without considering where the phlegm will fall. Anyway, it has nothing to do with them.

Our country's legends about ghosts and gods have always been taken "very seriously." When people hear that something should not be done, and if done, the ghosts and gods will deal with you in such and such a way, they are afraid of how the ghosts and gods will deal with them, so they don't do it. Unfortunately, the saying "Do not spit" was not attached to some ghostly words by our ancestors thousands of years ago. Otherwise, would we still need to put up signs everywhere to urge people to stop? They would have stopped on their own long ago!

But then again, adding "ghostly words" to the urging not to do something is originally the cleverness of the persuader. They have grasped humanity's weakness—self-interest—and then "ghostified" it. Doing it is not beneficial to oneself, so those with a strong sense of self-interest cautiously avoid doing it. If you don't believe me, try changing the sign urging people not to spit to "Spitting harms people, may Heaven and Earth punish you," and it will definitely be effective.

Antiques, "rarity makes them valuable," caters to human curiosity. Therefore, regardless of whether the person or event associated with the item is virtuous or foolish, superior or inferior, as long as the item itself is fun and rare, it can be considered a rare commodity. It is said that leaving behind fragrances and leaving behind hidden treasures each has its own merits.

For example, Yan Song of the Ming Dynasty, a treacherous official who harmed the people and the country, has been condemned by the official history with an axe, and dramas and novels have also vividly described him, cursed by all. However, the plaques of several old shops in old Beijing, such as "Liu Bi Ju" and "He Nian Tang," which are said to have been written by Yan Fenyi, are actually praised by everyone as miracles. Another example is Yuan Shikai's "Hongxian Emperor," who not only betrayed the Republic of China, but also made a short dream of eighty-three days, causing laughter everywhere. However, his specially made porcelain, with the marks "Made in the Hongxian Year" and "Made in Jurentang," is priced the same as famous kilns of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, because only one batch was made, and the "imperial reign" ended. There are not many genuine products, and the workmanship is quite exquisite. His imperial flags, imperial seals, etc., are displayed in the Historical Museum on the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City, along with the Heavenly King's seal of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, relics of Hong Xiuquan and Yang Xiuqing, and ancient tripods and vessels of the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Song dynasties, each occupying a part of historical relics. (In June of the Tongzhi Jiazi year of the Qing Dynasty, Zeng Guoquan's army entered Nanjing and obtained Hong's Heavenly King's seal, which he presented to his brother Guofan. Guofan first used high-quality jade pages of paper printed with fifty pages, then presented the original seal and other spoils of war to the Qing court. Zeng Gong distributed the printed copies to capable generals as souvenirs and personally added inscriptions. During the Guangxu years, the former generals gradually declined and often sold the "seal" pieces they received as antiques, each piece worth five or six hundred taels of gold, more expensive than ancient paintings of the Song and Ming dynasties. After obtaining this seal, the Qing court also treasured it in the palace. Therefore, after the Republic of China, all antiques were received from the Qing imperial family, and this seal was still intact and displayed in the museum for everyone to see. If the Qing dynasty had not fallen, this seal would still be a treasured secret within the imperial palace.)

Last winter, I read in the West Electric News that European and American philatelists are buying French "Vichy" stamps at very high prices. The "Vichy government" was a "puppet organization" formed in 1940 when Marshal Pétain (also translated as Petain) signed a peace treaty with Germany. After the Allied victory in 1945, the Vichy authorities were all arrested and executed. There is no doubt that the stamps they issued were "counterfeit stamps." However, although they cannot be used for general circulation, they are interesting to collect because counterfeit objects cannot be obtained again and are enough to be considered Curio.

In August of the 34th year, one year after Japan announced its surrender, counterfeit goods were being sold everywhere in old Beijing. No one wanted anything from "Manchukuo" or "Jidong" even at low prices. Sellers were afraid of being scolded, so they had to hide in remote alleys and empty fields to peddle their wares and were often met with disdain, which was a reflection of accumulated resentment and righteousness. But in the last two years, "counterfeit" goods have become scarce and have become "rare commodities." Things that were once disgusting and hateful have turned into Curio that are fun to play with and collect. This is not a change in "people's" perceptions, but a change in the nature of the "objects." Originally, during the puppet era of "Manchukuo" and "Jidong," although they were merely actors in costumes, they put on a full display. They manufactured things like "commemorative items for the founding of the country," "ceremony albums," and "silverware," and the Japanese who were pulling the strings behind the scenes were skilled in engineering techniques, helping to decorate them with splendor and beauty. Therefore, documents and goods signed by "Kangde" (Puyi's reign title in "Manchukuo") had the potential to follow in the footsteps of "Yuan Huang Hongxian." Zheng Xiaoxu, the puppet prime minister, was originally a famous scholar known for his calligraphy. He died in 1938, having served as a "founding hero" of the puppet state for six or seven years, writing many albums related to "ceremonies." These have now become rare items, more valuable than his calligraphy albums before he became a "traitor." This is not valuing "treachery," but valuing its Curio nature.
