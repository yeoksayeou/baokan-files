### New York "Sun" Comments on Our Currency Reform; Effectively Correcting Inflation

[Central News Agency, New York, 28th of This Month] An editorial in the conservative New York Sun stated: President Chiang Kai-shek's call for the support of all Chinese people for currency reform to overcome difficulties is a "sound and patriotic proposition" and should be strictly observed by all Chinese people. The newspaper's editorial reads as follows: The Chinese government is now using all the powers granted to it by the new constitution to solve the country's economic and political difficulties. The reform of China's currency system has corrected a very serious inflationary situation. The issuance of the new currency is intended to reorganize China's finances and strengthen economic controls. President Chiang also asked the people of the country this week to safeguard this reform plan in order to overcome difficulties. He also took this opportunity to reaffirm the true meaning of the two characters "Republic" known to the Chinese people. President Chiang said: "It must be known that the government is the government of all the people, and the country is the country of all the people. As the ancients said, "If the skin is gone, where will the hair attach?" At a time when the bandits are rampant and the national situation is serious, the people, the country, and the government are closely related in terms of fortune, misfortune, honor, and disgrace, and there is no difference in terms of life and death." This is indeed a sound and patriotic proposition that should be adhered to by the people of a constitutional republic. President Chiang pointed out the crux of the problem and supported the theory that the new economic policy will succeed with the strong tone of a statesman.

### The Government Will Never Discriminate Against the North; All Parties Should Not Draw Boundaries Themselves; Zhang Lisheng's Earnest Speech at the Tianjin Industry and Commerce Symposium

[Special Dispatch from Tianjin, 29th of This Month] Vice President of the Executive Yuan Zhang Lisheng attended the Tianjin Industry and Commerce Symposium on the morning of the 29th. During the meeting, all industries unanimously expressed their support for the economic reform plan and raised issues such as restoring industrial loans and diverting floating capital. After summarizing them, Zhang gave a general explanation, stating that the government fully understands the difficulties encountered by legitimate industry and commerce, and still hopes that they will abide by laws and regulations and be patient for the time being. Once the reform plan is successful and the economy is stabilized, everything will be easily resolved. Regarding the issue of industrial loans, Zhang especially placed his hopes on commercial banks. According to Zhang, today's statement shows that the rectification of commercial banks is the issue that he is most concerned about. Zhang's speech at the meeting this morning moved people from all walks of life to applaud repeatedly. Zhang explained that the government will never discriminate against the North and hopes that all parties will not draw boundaries themselves.

Profits Flow to Improper Places; Guidance of Funds Lacks Proper Channels

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 29th of This Month] Zhang Lisheng held a press conference at the Tianjin Municipal Government at 5:00 PM on the 29th. The press conference was conducted in an extremely free, lively, and pleasant atmosphere. In addition to answering reporters' questions, Zhang listened to the news media's opinions on economic reform with a kind and friendly attitude. During the meeting, Zhang discussed in detail how to guide floating capital to production and how to reorganize commercial banks. Zhang said: Guiding floating capital to production is a matter of course, but it has not been done in such a rational way in the past. There are many social backgrounds. Taking the period after the victory as an example, the public security situation in some places was not good, and the cities and villages were almost isolated. All of these and many other situations were not suitable for industrial construction, which is the reason why industrial development could not be achieved. However, today, there are no shortage of legitimate outlets for floating capital. For example, China Textile and the China Merchants Bureau, the government has decided to issue shares for sale, which is a very promising undertaking. In addition, the government holds US$290 million in materials (including enemy and puppet industries), which has also been decided to be sold. These are all good targets for floating capital. As for the reorganization of commercial banks, in terms of the actual situation, what grievances or hatred does the government have against them that it must destroy them? However, "need" is the only condition for their existence. In the current situation, purely legitimate banks cannot maintain their operations and have to change their tricks and engage in illegal activities. Therefore, their existence is unnecessary. Regarding the stabilization of materials and the inspection of warehouses, Zhang said: The government's regulations on suspending loans and increasing capital for commercial banks are to promote the flow of private gold and cash into legitimate channels, so as not to affect prices again. As for the inspection of warehouses, it will be implemented when necessary, but this measure will inevitably disturb the people. If the people can abide by the law and follow the economic reform plan, the government does not want to adopt this method. Zhang finally spoke broadly about China's customs and habits, pointing out that the implementation of laws and regulations cannot rely solely on political power, but must be thoroughly understood by the people.

Commercial Banks Should Undertake the Task of Industrial Loans

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 29th of This Month] Zhang Lisheng attended the Tianjin Industry and Commerce Symposium on the morning of the 29th to listen to opinions on the implementation of the economic reform plan for various industries. Attendees included the heads of the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, the Money Industry Association, the General Labor Union, and important industrial trade associations, totaling more than 200 people. The participants generally believed that the government's implementation of economic and financial reform was urgently needed and were willing to enthusiastically support it. Some people also raised some specific issues, hoping that the government would consider them. After the meeting, Vice President Zhang summarized the opinions of various industries and said: The general difficulties of the industry and commerce sector were already in the government's imagination. Now, after everyone's statement, the government's understanding is even deeper. Especially, the industry and commerce sector in North China suffered all kinds of enemy and puppet bullying and oppression during the Anti-Japanese War. It was not easy to support their operations. Although I have only been in Tianjin for one day, I already know that banks are not all engaged in speculation and commerce is not all speculation. However, I hope that during the implementation of this economic reform, everyone will have a common understanding, that is, the government's decision-making may not be perfect. If it is said that there is an intention to destroy industry and commerce, there is no such thing. From the government's overall perspective, one industry or another may feel temporary difficulties, but once the major problems are solved, the minor problems will be easier to deal with. Regarding the issue of increasing the import quota in North China, I know very well that Tianjin is the second largest commercial port in the country, and I have instructed the Transportation Control Committee to make a reasonable and fair distribution. If any problem belongs to the local needs and the government can do it, the government will not fail to resolve it reasonably. Regarding the issue of industrial loans, it can be discussed together with the issue of floating capital. We can imagine that if all industries have to rely on government loans, it is not a good thing. Everyone knows that the government's income is nothing more than tax revenue, borrowing, or increasing the issuance of currency, all of which are enough to affect prices. Therefore, industrial loans are actually the task of commercial banks. I hope the banking community will take on this responsibility. Regarding the issue of industrial loans and the treatment of public school teachers, I am sure that this matter is of great concern to the President. I believe that everyone will have the opportunity to improve their lives once the reform is successful, so the most important thing is that everyone must grit their teeth, be patient for a while, and first seek the success of the reform plan and the stability of prices.

The Issuance of Gold Certificates Is By No Means a Disguised Large Bill

Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Finance and Currency Department, spoke after Vice President Zhang finished, regarding the issue of the issuance of gold certificates: Some people have argued that the issuance of gold certificates is equivalent to the issuance of large bills. A correct understanding of this point is extremely necessary for the people of the country. This can be given a positive number. Including the Northeast circulating notes, it is about 600 trillion, and the depreciation of the legal currency is about one-6 millionth of that before the war. The current total amount is only equal to 100 million yuan before the war. Given the vastness of our country, it is obvious that 100 million yuan is not enough to meet the needs. Therefore, the government decided to use the gold standard and issue gold certificates, which are completely separate from the old currency and have nothing to do with it. Therefore, the concept that gold certificates are equal to large bills must be thoroughly corrected. Du Jianshi, Mayor of Tianjin, added at the end: According to the propaganda communications of the Communist bandits that have been seized, the Communist bandits are directing their hidden elements to spread rumors, pointing out that the issuance of gold certificates is equivalent to the issuance of large bills. We must not be shaken by such rumors.

### Second Session of the Legislative Yuan; Resumes in September; Resumption Ceremony to Be Held First on the 3rd; Meeting Opens on the 7th

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 29th of This Month] The second session of the Legislative Yuan will begin in September in accordance with the Constitution. The Secretariat of the Yuan has issued a meeting notice in accordance with the resolution of the 22nd meeting of the first session, asking the members to report to the Yuan from the 1st. According to the rules of procedure of the Legislative Yuan, meetings will be held every Tuesday and Friday. The first meeting of the second session should be held on the 3rd (Friday). The Yuan will hold a resumption ceremony first on that day, which happens to be Victory Memorial Day, and will officially open the meeting on the 7th.

### Government Promotes Conservation of Materials; Vehicle Licenses and Fuel Consumption Are Strictly Reduced

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 29th of This Month] After the promulgation of the emergency financial and economic order, the government attached special importance to the promotion of the conservation of materials. It has also been based on Article 12, Paragraph 1 of the "Regulations on Consolidating Finance and Strengthening Economic Control," "In Shanghai and other cities approved by the Executive Yuan, the licenses of various types of vehicles shall be reduced by one-fourth to one-third within two months after the promulgation of these regulations, and the amount of fuel used by vehicles shall be strictly restricted." All requests for vehicle transfers and vehicle licenses submitted by various places will not be approved. It is also learned that the Ministry of Communications has drafted a draft of measures to restrict the use of public and private vehicles and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The content of the draft is more lenient than the original measures of the Executive Yuan's Conservation Supervision Committee on some private vehicles and fuel consumption. The Yuan believes that after the implementation of the emergency financial and economic order, all restrictions are stricter than before, and there can be no relaxation of the vehicle item. The matter was handed over to the Conservation Supervision Committee of the Yuan for discussion, and it was resolved to reject it. In addition, the motions that were not approved by the committee at the same time included the following: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Government's request for the Municipal Council to request the cancellation of the restriction on vehicle transfers, and to collect special relief donations from both buyers and sellers during the transfer. After discussion at the meeting, it was considered unnecessary to relax the restriction on vehicle transfers in order to collect special relief donations. Therefore, the principle of transfer should still maintain the original measures, and only those who are qualified to obtain vehicles can transfer them. Otherwise, it will not be flexible. (2) The Shanghai Municipal Government replied to the China Textile Construction Company's request for the issuance of 60 license plate trucks, which are specifically used for transporting coal, cotton, and finished products from its various factories. Should the license plate be issued? The meeting considered that no new license plates can be added and decided to postpone the discussion. (3) The Materials Supply Committee replied that the Materials Supply Bureau's use of vehicles cannot be reduced for a while. Should the record be approved? It was resolved that small cars and Jeeps should be reduced first, and then cargo trucks should be reduced. The amount of reduction in the early stage is one-fourth. (4) The Ministry of Communications telegraphed on behalf of the Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau, requesting special approval to convert the registration of private transportation trucks. Should it be approved? It was resolved that registration in the name of a private individual is not applicable and will not be approved.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 29th of This Month] The conservation campaign decided to be promoted by the Executive Yuan in order to comply with the emergency financial and economic order is currently being actively launched. In terms of saving gasoline, it has been decided to start from Shanghai City and strictly implement the restrictions on extravagant and wasteful public and private cars. Their fuel consumption is limited to public use and production, construction, business, or business needs. Private entertainment is absolutely prohibited. It is learned that the Second Legislative Yuan once sent a letter to the Executive Yuan stating that many members of the Legislative Yuan have their own cars, and that vehicle licenses should be specially approved for members of the Legislative Yuan. The Conservation Supervision Committee of the Executive Yuan has decided on this case: "Private individuals who apply for vehicle licenses should still handle them in accordance with the regulations on the restriction of private vehicle use."

Sino-Hong Kong Negotiations Begin This Week; Focus on Prompting Hong Kong to Cooperate in Anti-Smuggling

It is said that the negotiations will begin at the beginning of this week, and its focus is on prompting Hong Kong to quickly implement the Sino-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement and its technical cooperation issues, so that this issue can be resolved through negotiation. All other issues can be easily resolved. In addition, Customs Commissioner Luo Qingxiang also rushed to Hong Kong from Macau to participate in the negotiations.

### Accelerate the Shipment of Military Supplies to China: General Wedemeyer's Staff Actively Proceeding; Detailed List of US Army Sales of Materials to Be Submitted to Our Country Next Month

[United Press International, Washington, 28th] Highly placed sources in the U.S. government denied on the 28th that the $125 million in military aid to China was being delayed due to deliberate actions or bureaucratic red tape by the Department of the Army.

According to sources close to the Department of the Army, but not internal officials, General Wedemeyer's staff is, in fact, making every effort to expedite the processing and shipment of military supplies to China. As head of the Planning and Execution Staff, General Wedemeyer is responsible for all military aid programs, including those for Greece, Turkey, and China. Observers believe that General Wedemeyer, with his past experience as commander of the China Theater and as President's special envoy to China, will be able to use his familiarity with China's problems to assist Chinese officials here.

While the military aid portion of the aid to China bill was not implemented from its passage in April until early August, sources close to the Department of the Army said that the Army, Navy, and Air Force did not receive the authority to sell military supplies to China until August 2nd.

A senior expert cited other reasons for the delay, stating that the $125 million in military aid was an unconditional gift to China, and the Chinese government could purchase military supplies from any market. However, because the United States was just beginning its "Cold War" military buildup, foreign countries or individuals could not purchase large quantities of surplus materials at low prices. After the Chinese government was unable to purchase any quantity of surplus materials and trade with private arms factories, they requested to purchase from the stockpiles of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This increased the amount of paperwork for the Department of the Army and placed an extra burden on General Wedemeyer's staff. However, the Department of the Army will be able to complete its work by September and submit to China a detailed list of materials that the Army can sell, along with their prices. The Air Force and Navy will be able to complete this earlier because they have fewer materials to sell.

Well-informed sources particularly pointed out that China is currently receiving the same treatment as Greece and Turkey in terms of pricing. Congress has repeatedly criticized that Greece and Turkey enjoy a 10% discount when purchasing supplies, while China has to pay the full price. However, these sources said that the discount on old transactions applied to surplus materials and no longer exists. All three countries must now pay the full price.

The method for determining prices is as follows: (1) For goods that the Department of the Army must replenish, the purchasing country must pay the current replenishment cost. This price may be higher than the original price but is equal to the current market price. (2) For large quantities of goods that the Department of the Army possesses and has a surplus in current needs, they will be sold at the original purchase cost. It is understood that China will purchase a large number of rifles based on the second provision. (3) For surplus materials that the Department of the Army possesses and does not need to replenish in the near future, the price will be similar to the old surplus material prices. However, it is said that not many of these materials will be sold.

Military Aid to China: All Funds Appropriately Allocated

It is understood that China has allocated its $125 million in military aid as follows: $87.5 million will be used to purchase materials needed for ground troops, from firearms to medicines; $28.5 million will be used to purchase air force equipment; $9 million will be used to purchase naval equipment. These expenses will include the shipping costs that China must pay. It is generally speculated that China has purchased approximately $15 million worth of equipment from private sources and has completed a purchase contract for approximately $20 million worth of aviation equipment for the Air Force, the latter of which was made before the Foreign Aid Bill was passed. However, China had not paid at the time. Nevertheless, Chinese sources say that, to date, no goods have arrived at the wharves of Shanghai.

Experts added that two reasons have complicated the issue of purchasing military supplies. First, China wants to purchase far more goods than it can pay for. Second, the Department of the Army must survey camps and arsenals to determine the materials available for sale and their prices. Therefore, both the Chinese government and the Department of the Army have to wait to decide on a distribution list of goods that suits China's needs and its budget. Although the State Department has a secret priority allocation plan that directs military materials to foreign countries in a period when there is a close relationship to US foreign policy, authoritative sources say that China has not been affected by the Berlin crisis and the reopening of the Greek war, and remains on an equal footing with other regions.

It is understood that the Department of the Army is seeking materials in the Pacific region and has already packed materials from Hawaii for shipment to China. However, materials in the Pacific region are not as plentiful as pro-Nationalist individuals within the United States claim, and the materials remaining in Hawaii have already been sold to China. Authoritative sources also pointed out that the cost of repairing certain surplus materials to make them usable is even greater than manufacturing new ones.

### On the Emergency Decree for Financial and Economic Measures

— Zhang Baiyi

On August 19th, President Chiang issued the Emergency Decree for Financial and Economic Measures in accordance with the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of National Mobilization for the Suppression of the Rebellion. Its main points are: (1) Starting immediately, the Gold Yuan shall be the standard currency, and Gold Yuan notes shall be issued with full reserves. The existing legal currency and Northeast circulating notes shall be redeemed within a specified period. (2) All gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currency held by the people shall be redeemed within a specified period. Anyone who holds them after the deadline shall be penalized. (3) The foreign exchange assets of the people of this country held abroad shall be registered and managed within a specified period, and violators shall be sanctioned. (4) Finance shall be reorganized and economic controls shall be strengthened to stabilize prices, balance the national budget and international balance of payments. Based on the above main points, the following are formulated: (1) Measures for the Issuance of Gold Yuan Notes; (2) Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Held by the People; (3) Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Held Abroad by the People of the Republic of China; (4) Measures for Reorganizing Finance and Strengthening Economic Controls, and promulgated simultaneously with this decree. Each of these measures shall be regarded as part of this decree, and the Executive Yuan shall be authorized to issue necessary regulations or supplementary measures for each of these measures to facilitate the implementation of this decree.

Upon careful reading of the Emergency Decree for Financial and Economic Measures and its four supplementary measures, its main focus should be to seek to use currency reform as a means to stabilize the current financial and economic situation. At the same time, in order to ensure the smooth completion of currency reform, the second to fourth measures are in place. Of course, we have been hoping for currency reform for a long time, and now that it is being implemented, it is naturally exciting! However, there are still some aspects of the technical problems of this currency reform that are worth discussing. The following is a separate discussion:

According to the provisions of the Measures for the Issuance of Gold Yuan Notes, its main points are: (1) The gold content of each Gold Yuan note is 0.22217 grams of pure gold. (2) Three million Legal Tender notes (法幣) can be exchanged for one Gold Yuan note. (3) The deadline for exchanging Legal Tender notes for Gold Yuan notes is November 20. (4) Forty percent of the reserves for the issuance of Gold Yuan notes shall be gold, silver, and foreign exchange, and the remaining sixty percent shall be securities and assets of state-owned enterprises. (5) The total amount of Gold Yuan notes issued shall be limited to 2 billion yuan. (6) A Gold Yuan Note Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee shall be established to be responsible for the inspection and safekeeping of the reserves for the issuance of Gold Yuan notes.

First, the deadline for exchanging Legal Tender notes for Gold Yuan notes is extended for approximately three months, which is too long. Based on past experience, the fluctuation of prices in three months is very large. If prices can be guaranteed to remain absolutely stable in the next three months, then all is well; otherwise, the value of Gold Yuan notes will inevitably be affected. Because the government issues Gold Yuan notes and at the same time allows Legal Tender notes to circulate for a long period of three months, this actually creates two types of currency circulating at the same time. When the amount of currency in circulation is higher than the amount of goods available on the market, it is difficult to guarantee that a new surplus of currency will not be formed. Therefore, in addition to ceasing the printing and issuance of Legal Tender notes, the government must also pay attention to the fact that government agencies should no longer directly use Gold Yuan notes for treasury expenditures. That is, government treasury expenditures must be funded by government treasury revenues, and the means of directly printing and issuing Legal Tender notes for expenditures can never be used as in the past. If this point cannot be absolutely achieved, then not only will the effect of the Legal Tender notes reform be adversely affected, but especially the five million customs gold unit notes (關金券) currently stored in the Central Bank's vaults should be absolutely stopped from being issued. According to the author's opinion, the government should quickly issue subsidiary currency notes and subsidiary coins such as copper coins and nickel coins on the one hand, and on the other hand, make every effort to shorten the deadline for redeeming Legal Tender notes, the shorter the better, and it would be ideal if it can be completed within half a month. If it is said that the branches of the Central Bank are limited, and it is impossible to complete the redemption of Legal Tender notes in a short period of time, then the Central Bank can entrust the branches of the National Three Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury to handle it. If it is still not enough, then it can entrust commercial banks and merchant houses throughout the country and post offices in various places to do it. For example, in Shanghai, if the Central Bank mobilizes all national banks, bureaus, and commercial banks to handle it, it is believed that it can be completed within five days. Half a month later, the government officially announced that Legal Tender notes are prohibited from circulating. If there are still those who have not had time to complete the redemption, the Central Bank may extend it for half a month, but they must directly exchange Gold Yuan notes at the local branches of the Central Bank.

Second, the total amount of Gold Yuan notes issued is set at two billion yuan, which is a technical issue worthy of special consideration. If the government immediately issues this amount, it is equivalent to 60,000 trillion old Legal Tender notes, but the current amount of Legal Tender notes issued is probably only about 10,000 trillion. Although the government states that the current Gold Yuan note reserve is 100%, the Legal Tender note reserve is actually 500% to 1000%, so why must Legal Tender notes still be reformed? From this, we can see that the presence or absence of a reserve has no absolute and inseparable relationship with the currency. For example, the United States' gold reserves exceed the amount of paper money in circulation, but prices in the United States are still higher than before the war, and the United States is also experiencing inflation. Today, if the government issues three to four hundred million national currency notes, it can collect all the Legal Tender notes currently circulating in various places. The original problem was not the lack of resources, but rather the people's inability to trust. Because the people cannot trust it, the people do not deposit the currency they receive into banks, so the bank loses its banking function, the financial market becomes chaotic, and Legal Tender notes all circulate in the market, while goods, gold, silver, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars become the people's "savings tools." How can prices not rise, and how can the currency be stabilized? In addition, the government continues to use issuance as a means of raising funds, how can the vicious inflation of currency be avoided? Today, the government is determined to reform the currency system, and the original purpose is to restore the credibility of the currency, but the government must limit the amount of Gold Yuan notes issued in stages. Initially, it can only issue three to four hundred million yuan at most. Only when the people restore absolute trust in Gold Yuan notes, and the people still compete to deposit Gold Yuan notes in banks for time deposits and savings deposits as before the war, can Gold Yuan notes be increased. If this is not done, then the future contains danger. Regarding this point, the Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee must be absolutely responsible, first consult with the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, and then execute its powers accordingly. The government authorities must not think that with sufficient reserves, they can saturate the amount they issue.

Third, according to Article 7 of the Measures for the Issuance of Gold Yuan Notes, the method for handling Legal Tender notes that have not yet been repaid by the government will be formulated separately by the Executive Yuan. Regarding the repayment of principal and interest on Legal Tender bonds, the author has repeatedly made suggestions. If one Gold Yuan note is exchanged for three million Legal Tender notes, then both pre-war Legal Tender bonds and wartime Legal Tender bonds will suffer considerable losses. However, if principal and interest are repaid based on the face value of the Gold Yuan note, then the government will have no ability to bear this burden. According to a report in this newspaper from Nanjing on August 11, China owes 10 billion yuan in domestic debt, 80 million Customs Gold Units, 15 million pounds sterling, and 150 million US dollars. According to Article 7 of the Gold Yuan Note Issuance Regulations, the gold bonds (excluding Customs Gold Unit bonds) and the US dollar treasury bills issued in 1936 of the Republic of China should be reissued as Gold Yuan bonds at the statutory exchange rate. It can be seen that the holders of gold bonds have a much greater advantage than the holders of Legal Tender bonds and Customs Gold Unit bonds. Legal Tender bonds, including Customs Gold Unit bonds, total 11.6 billion Legal Tender notes. If 3 million Legal Tender notes can be exchanged for one Gold Yuan note, it only equals 3,900 Gold Yuan notes. The government feels that this burden is too light, and at the same time, the bondholders suffer too much loss. Therefore, the author believes that it is not a bad idea to increase the repayment of principal and interest by an average of 100,000 times, that is, to repay it with 390 million Gold Yuan notes. However, it still needs to be repaid with newly issued consolidated bonds, so that the government's financial credibility will not be harmed, and it will also seem fairer to Legal Tender bondholders.

Fourth, regarding the measures for handling the gold, silver, and foreign currency held by the people to assist currency reform, its main purpose is to declare that gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currency belong to the state. First, let's discuss the foreign currency issue. According to Article 3 of this law, US currency notes shall be exchanged for Gold Yuan notes at a rate of four Gold Yuan notes per dollar, and currency notes of other countries shall be exchanged for Gold Yuan notes according to the foreign exchange rate of the Central Bank, all limited to before September 30. According to Article 2, foreign currency notes are prohibited from circulation, sale, and possession in the country. Regarding this matter, the execution technique is worth considering. If the phenomenon of all US agencies in China directly paying salaries in US dollars is not eliminated, then the prohibition of circulation, sale, and possession of US dollars in China will inevitably be hindered. The government must first go through diplomatic channels and negotiate with the US authorities that all salaries and other expenses of all agencies in China must be paid in Chinese Gold Yuan notes, just like Chinese agencies abroad pay in the local currencies of those countries. The US dollars of all broadcasting agencies must be fully exchanged for Gold Yuan notes at the Central Bank. If this point cannot be effectively achieved, then the prohibition of the black market for US dollars and their circulation, sale, and possession will eventually become a dead letter.

Fifth, the exchange rate of four Gold Yuan notes per US dollar, with one Gold Yuan note exchanged for three million Legal Tender notes, equals 12 million Legal Tender notes exchanged for one US dollar. This exchange rate is the government's pursuit of the black market for US dollars. Since the government is following the black market, if the black market cannot be eliminated, and the black market price of US dollars rises again, then how can the government absorb US dollars and other foreign currencies? Before the currency reform, the Central Bank had an official exchange rate for foreign exchange, but did anyone go to exchange US dollars for Legal Tender notes? Since August 23, the results of collecting US dollars and Hong Kong dollars in various places have been quite good, but in order to be effective in the long term, the government must be able to fully absorb the foreign currency currently existing in the country, it must thoroughly prohibit the black market for US dollars and Hong Kong dollars. In addition to finding ways to negotiate with the United States to prohibit its agencies in China from directly paying in US dollars, it is also necessary to use other effective methods to eliminate the existence of the US dollar black market.

[This newspaper, Wuxi, 29th] Because prices in Wuxi fluctuated sharply, violating the Emergency Decree for Economic Measures, Wang Maogong convened a symposium in the county government at 10:00 AM on the 29th with those in charge of industry, commerce, finance, and the press to listen to their opinions. Qian Sunqing, chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, spoke first, mentioning the difficulty of exchanging Gold Yuan notes and the refusal of banks and merchants to accept small notes, or the return of the already exchanged Legal Tender notes to the market, which has caused social unrest. He then said that merchants and people are very supportive of the new plan, but some people are taking advantage of the support to exploit it, causing the essence of the policy to change. He also suggested issuing more subsidiary currency to avoid the invisible price increase of goods. Wang immediately instructed the Central Bank manager to improve the exchange method and provide as much convenience as possible to the public. He also gave instructions on controlling prices, conscription, food levies, county finance, and other issues, hoping to assist in their success. Regarding prices, he hoped that merchants in various industries would automatically control them.

Any commodity cannot exceed the price. If it exceeds, it will be punished. Before the punishment method is promulgated, it will be transferred to the Zhen Special Criminal Court for handling.

### French President Nominates Socialist Leader Ramadier to Organize New Cabinet; Communists Demand Formation of Coalition Government

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] President Auriol met with former Socialist Prime Minister Ramadier this morning and asked him to come forward and organize a new cabinet. Ramadier has agreed to consider it. He will first consult with various French political parties to see what each party thinks of his intention to organize a new cabinet. He will give a formal reply to the French President at 5 pm tonight.

[United Press, Paris, 29th] According to Ramadier, "France is in a dire situation. We must have the courage to ask every Frenchman to make the same sacrifices." Ramadier advocated the formation of a strong "action" government and that all parties guarantee its life until at least June 19 next year.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] On the first day of the French cabinet crisis, President Auriol met with various political parties and key figures in parliament as usual in order to find a solution to the increasingly turbulent French political life. Political observers here believe that the overall situation seems extremely turbulent, and they emphasize that, according to tradition, the Socialist Party, which caused the cabinet crisis, should be asked to form a new government. This theory is now supported by the parliamentary group of the Popular Democratic Party, and Ramadier has been nominated. However, according to the same sources, it is doubtful whether a Socialist Party government can be passed by the National Assembly. According to the constitution, the new president must first obtain the support of 310 votes in the National Assembly before he can begin to form a cabinet. Observers believe that former Prime Minister Schumann has the ability to call for support and obtain a majority in the National Assembly, so it would be appropriate for him to take charge of the new cabinet. However, it remains doubtful whether Schumann can find a solution to economic problems and eliminate the disagreements of most political groups on this matter. Finally, it is heard that some political figures now feel that without the cooperation of the Communist Party, the French economy cannot recover and production cannot increase to a sufficient level. Although they feel that this proposal is still too early, they particularly support the view that the formation of a new government should not exclude the Communist Party.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The French Communist Party Political Bureau issued a communiqué tonight calling on all workers to strengthen unity and take joint action to enable France to form a democratic coalition government. At the same time, the French Labor Federation office also issued a communiqué stating that today's cabinet crisis proves that a country cannot be safely governed without the labor stage and opposition to this stage. It is now urgently necessary to organize a democratic coalition government of bread in order to implement a genuine French policy, protect industry from the risk of unemployment, and reduce the profits of shameless capitalists in order to lower the cost of living and adjust wages.

[United Press, Paris, 28th] It is reported that due to the fall of the French middle-of-the-road government, General de Gaulle will soon launch a full-scale campaign to regain power. De Gaulle is expected to issue a statement denouncing the Third Force government, demanding the dissolution of the National Assembly, and holding a national general election. It is rumored that he is confident that he can win at least 41% of the vote and regain power.

### Moscow Negotiations: Four-Power Agreement; Publication of Communiqué Still Pending; Purge in Soviet-Occupied Zone of Germany

[Our Report] London, 29th Broadcast from Moscow: The ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France held a meeting at the American Embassy on the 29th, lasting 90 minutes.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] According to well-informed sources: an agreement has been reached in the Moscow negotiations. Everyone intends that if this statement is true, then its scope and stability are extremely limited. Officials are still keeping silent on this matter. A simple communiqué was originally scheduled to be issued at noon today, but it was later postponed. The representatives of the four countries still need to meet once more to make a decision on technical principles. The rumor that the commanders-in-chief of the four occupying forces in Berlin will receive instructions jointly signed by the four countries to resolve the currency issue and the issue of mutual blockades is no longer denied by any party.

According to the opinions of those in charge of various circles, the four commanders-in-chief will probably be able to implement theoretical agreements electronically within a week. In essence, the four countries will soon face each other in a situation before the Berlin incident occurred. The pressure of attacking Japan will still exist, although the appearance may be different, but in reality, its power will be as strong as before. If a temporary communiqué is issued in the middle of this week, followed by the actual consequences in the next few days, the resistance to negotiating the entire German issue and broader international issues can be expected to be removed. However, preliminary talks must be held before the negotiations begin, and these talks will undoubtedly be extremely difficult.

[United Press, Berlin, 29th] Berlin newspapers licensed by the West reported on the 29th that the German Communist Socialist Unity Party in the Soviet-occupied zone is conducting a large-scale purge. "New Daily," the mouthpiece of the U.S. military, said that many Germans imprisoned in Soviet military concentration camps have been released. Soviet guards told them the reason for their release was to free up space for future "large-scale" arrests. The newspaper said that in Saxony, under Soviet occupation, there is a five-mile-long concentration camp dedicated to those with "anti-Soviet attitudes."

### Another Soviet General Dies

### Soviet Union Demands Return of Ukrainian Girl; U.S. Refuses

[United Press, Berlin, 29th] Soviet newspapers today attacked the U.S. authorities in Berlin for refusing to return a 14-year-old Ukrainian girl to the Soviets, attempting to create another "Kasenkina" case. The girl's name is Kolorenky, and she is disabled in both feet. The Soviets said she desperately wanted to return home, but the U.S. refused to hand her over on the afternoon of the 28th. U.S. liaison officials said that when the girl heard about the possibility of returning home, her eyes filled with tears of sorrow.

### U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee Releases Preliminary Report on Espionage Case; Condemns Government for Obstructing Investigation

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] The House Committee on Un-American Activities today condemned various departments of the Truman administration for failing to hand over loyalty investigation files of suspected elements within the government to the committee, and criticized the Federal Attorney General for failing to fulfill his duties and effectively enforce the Espionage Act and other laws. In its interim report, the committee attacked the White House for taking obstructive actions and the Attorney General for failing to implement the Espionage Act, and therefore the Attorney General should be held responsible for the growth and success of the Communist conspiracy in the United States. The report also provided a brief description of the preliminary investigation reports on various Communist espionage cases heard over the past month.

### Soviet Consul General in New York, Lomakin, to Depart; He May Be Appointed as Representative to the United Nations

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] Soviet Consul General in New York, Lomakin, left the United States today with his wife and children on the Swedish ship "Stockholm." A few hours before departure, he said, "I will go to Paris via Sweden," but upon boarding the ship, he told reporters, "I will return for vacation." It is believed here that Lomakin's trip to Paris may be as one of the Soviet representatives to attend the United Nations General Assembly.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] Ms. Kasenkina's right knee underwent surgery at Roosevelt Hospital today, and it went "very well." The doctor said that if there are no special circumstances, Kasenkina will definitely recover soon, and then she will need to recuperate in the hospital for three months.

### Mutual Detention of Ambassadors Between Soviet Union and Chile Finally Resolved; Ambassadors of Both Countries Depart for Their Home Countries by Air

[Agence France-Presse, Capital of Argentina, 28th] Soviet Ambassador to Chile, Shokov, arrived in the capital of Argentina by military plane today with 40 members of the embassy staff. At the same time, the Chilean Ambassador to Moscow also left Soviet territory by air with his family today and arrived in Helsinki. After the Soviet Union and Chile severed diplomatic relations, the Soviet authorities did not allow the Chilean Ambassador's Soviet wife to leave the Soviet Union, so the ambassadors of the two countries were mutually detained for a long time. Now, after mediation by Argentina, the issue has been resolved.

### Chinese and Korean Communists Support North Korean Invasion; South Korea Currently Incapable of Defense; Hodge Discusses North and South Korean Situation in Tokyo

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Hodge, the newly appointed commander of the U.S. military in Korea, declared at a press conference today on his way back to the United States that South Korea is incapable of preventing North Korea's invasion supported by Korean Communist troops operating in the northeastern provinces of China. Currently, South Korea is training a 50,000-man gendarmerie and equipping them with weapons. South Korea will also establish an army, but it will still be unable to resist the troops that may come from North Korea. North Korea can draw troops from within China. Currently, there is at least one Korean army division assisting the Chinese Communists in combat, and the Chinese Communist troops in Jilin Province are mixed Chinese and Korean troops.

The strength of the South Korean police force is being expanded to maintain law and order. The situation in South Korea will become more concrete in the next two or three months, which is worth paying attention to. Hodge said that he does not know when the U.S. military will withdraw from Korea, but it cannot stay there permanently. Hodge said that the development since the establishment of the new government has made him feel very happy. Korea's progress towards democracy depends on what the Koreans do. South Korean people openly and freely criticize the government without suffering retaliation. Korea must develop trade with China and Japan. It is extremely difficult for Korea to achieve economic independence and will still require assistance from the United States in the short term. Currently, about 500 people flee from North Korea to South Korea every day, and there have been 3 million refugees since the occupation. Hodge also said that he will be working at the U.S. Chief of Staff's office in the near future.

### Korean Ambassador Cho Byeong-ok Will First Pay a Courtesy Visit to China

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 29th] Cho Byeong-ok, the Korean representative to the United States and special envoy to China, the United Kingdom, France, the Philippines, and other countries, is scheduled to leave Seoul at the end of August and plans to first pay a courtesy visit to our country. After the Philippines and the United Kingdom recognize the Korean government, he will go to Manila, London, and other places. When the United Nations General Assembly convenes in Paris at the end of September, Cho will also assist the Korean delegation in presenting its views on the Korean issue to the General Assembly. Cho is 54 years old. Before the establishment of the Korean government, he was the Minister of Police Affairs of the South Korean transitional government and an important member of the Korean Democratic Party. He was originally an economist and received a PhD in philosophy from Columbia University in the United States. During his tenure as Minister of Police Affairs in October 1946, leftists attempted to assassinate him unsuccessfully.

### 5,000 Greek Guerrillas Sneak into Albania; Greek Government Military Headquarters to Be Completely Reorganized

[United Press, Athens, 29th] The Greek Army High Command will be reorganized because a large number of guerrillas in the Grammos Mountains have escaped into Albania through the encirclement of government troops. U.S. military mission chief in Greece, Fret, said that Major General Rochas, commander of the Greek 15th Division, will be replaced, which is the first step in the reorganization. The division failed to hold the gap in the pincer encirclement on the Albanian border, allowing 5,000 rebels to escape into Albania. At that time, the guerrillas were panicked when they fled, leaving behind a large number of weapons and unable to fight again immediately.

### United States Starts Drafting; Government Promulgates Exemption Regulations

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] 2,000 registration stations will be ready on the 29th to allow young Americans who are called to participate in peacetime service to register. It is estimated that 9.6 million young people between the ages of 18 and 25 will register, but only a small portion will be drafted.

### UN Economic and Social Council Concludes Seventh Session; Organizing Committee Encourages Trade Between Eastern and Western Europe

[United Press International, Geneva, August 28] The United Nations Economic and Social Council concluded its seventh session today. The Eastern and Western blocs reached an important agreement on economic issues, but were completely mired in a deadlock on social issues. Observers expressed pleasant surprise at the Soviet Union's concessions on economic matters. Soviet representative Arutyunyan spent almost an entire day debating the UN Economic Commission for Europe, harshly attacking the "imperialistic" Marshall Plan. He then changed his tone, making a compromise request to encourage economic trade between Eastern and Western Europe "on a commercial basis." He stated that the UN Economic Commission for Europe "can only serve as an institution to enable cooperation between Eastern and Western Europe, despite the existence of divisions between the two." The Council unanimously passed the work of the Economic Commission for Europe and decided to organize a committee to encourage East-West trade and development before adjourning. The committee will hold its first meeting here on September 27. The Council also unanimously passed a resolution to expand the work of the UN Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

Three Important Agendas Discussed With No Results

Conflicts between the Soviet Union and the United States and Western Europe greatly hindered the Council's work. Three of the most important agenda items were forced to be abandoned as a result. These three agenda items were the UN Draft Convention on Freedom of Information, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Draft Convention on Genocide. The Council legally submitted all three to the UN General Assembly to be held in Paris next month without any opinions attached.

### Japanese Military Potential Still Considerable

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, August 29] According to Kyodo News, Lieutenant General Eichelberger, commander of the US Eighth Army, said in San Francisco on the 27th: "Japan currently has no military strength, but its military capabilities are considerable. In the future, when the United States must stop a certain enemy country, Japan's assistance to the United States is essential. The Japanese people are very afraid of the expansion of Soviet power."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, August 29] Although Japan has promoted the achievements of democratization after the war, various violent groups still run rampant everywhere. Since this year, "the number of people arrested by June has reached as many as 4,354. The number has not decreased due to the large number of arrests. The Japanese National Police have decided to thoroughly crack down on them again starting in September. Currently, the most common crimes are intimidation and injury.

### Berlin Interlude

— Translated by Our Editorial Department

Hughs, the Berlin bureau chief of the American "Time" magazine, recently attended a banquet at the headquarters of the Polish military mission in Berlin. The following is Hughs' record of impressions after returning from the banquet.

In a white mansion at No. 42 Kurfürstendamm Street in dark Berlin, the electric lights shone brightly all night. The whirling sounds of the tap dance and the melodies of the polka were translated from the windows of the second-floor balcony to the quiet street. Outside the curtained glass windows, in the room illuminated by crystal candlesticks, hundreds of Berlin's international guests were being entertained by a short, thin man in uniform.

One side of his head had a scarred, bald spot, which shifted their gaze away from his gentle, pale eyes. He was Major General Prawen, the head of the Polish military mission. In this lifeless city, they were celebrating Polish Liberation Day—a new national holiday.

International Banquet, A Variety of Scenes

Here, for an extraordinary few hours, Berlin's hunger and the world's anxieties seemed as distant and forgotten as the darkness that had been driven away. The fragmented world, in the luxury of interlaced goblets—perhaps the only truly international language—was united. The bright Scottish kilt rustled against the dark brown Soviet uniform, and the American admiral's deep blue uniform was gently brushed by an Indian woman's blue veil. Russian brandy, French wine, and various Eastern European cocktails were spilled from glasses onto the oriental carpets in the rapid movements of mutual congratulations. Two large buffet tables were filled with various dishes: large platters of veal and chicken slices, various salads, and small piles of caviar. In the center of the table was a roast pig (with a tomato in its mouth), which was gradually divided and eaten by Soviet officers as the joyful night progressed.

However, although the orchestra selflessly alternated between Russian dances and foxtrots, even with the same customs, it could not sweep away the uneasy psychology, just as a cold draft blew in from an invisible window, stirring the sweating crowd. Three young guests were struggling to make conversation: one was a glittering-eyed British Army captain, one was a young American diplomat, and one was a fair-skinned, blond-haired Soviet adjutant with a slightly dazed expression, who apparently spoke a few words of English. The American had both hands in his pockets, while the other two regularly scooped assorted salads from the bowl with spoons. The British officer said, "I've only been here for two months, but I really like this place... of course, we don't have things like this to eat at home." The young Soviet adjutant nodded repeatedly and simply said, "Me too." This pleasant tripartite conversation seemed to be going smoothly. Suddenly, a dark-skinned, curly-haired Soviet major patted the adjutant on the shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear. The conversation stopped abruptly. The adjutant turned around, looking regretfully at his unfinished bowl. The American shrugged his shoulders.

Sweet, Sour, Bitter, Spicy, Both Ridiculous and Sad

It has been several months since Eastern and Western people began large-scale socializing in Berlin. So, it is only natural that the sweetness of cocktail conversations is mixed with some strong sourness. An American official pointed to a Soviet official and said to me: "That guy is staring at me—we often go boating together for fun." An English lady, who thought she had a talent for quick retorts, was asked by a friend why she used a large, strange-looking pin to hold a rose on her ample chest. She replied: "To make it easier for the Russians' eyes to pop out, you silly thing! Ha ha ha!" An American lady watched another corner of the room and said with a giggle: "Look at those Soviet women, they seem to have no necks, only chins, shoulders, and breasts. No necks!"

The criticized figures clung to their husbands, and their husbands were gathered together. Soviet officials and political advisors clustered in two corners of the hall, discussing in groups. The dining table was like a conference table, and they had to return to it every five minutes to hear an important decision.

The banquet did not end until midnight. As the guests left, they thanked the host, Major General Prawen.

Luxury and Meat Behind Red Doors, Corpses on the Roads

The road was pitch black, with only the lights of the nobles' cars shining. Dozens of Germans were curiously watching. A German woman whispered unhappily: "Russian women are wearing beautiful clothes now, but you can tell they are still not very used to it." Other women secretly admired the crisp and sonorous skirts. Brightly colored printed fabrics and dazzling necklaces rushed from the doorway into the cars, but a husband said angrily: "Let's go back. This can't cure hunger!" In the dark streets, resentment flared, but they dared not speak out.

An American plane roared overhead. The sound of American pop music came from the windows of the balcony.

Everyone returned to their posts.

### Mobilize Party Members to Assist the Government; Report Unscrupulous Merchants and Eliminate Communist Spies; Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters Holds Meeting of District Cadres

In order to assist the government in reforming the currency system and eliminating communist spies, the joint meeting of cadres and comrades from various district party branches of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality was held at 2:30 PM yesterday at the Municipal Stadium. More than 2,000 cadres of all levels attended. President Yu Hongjun of the Central Bank, Deputy Minister Tao of the Central Propaganda Department, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and others were invited to attend and provide guidance. After the ceremony, Chairman Fang delivered a speech, saying: "The two major tasks of our party comrades at present are to assist the government in reforming the currency system and eliminating communist spies. The suppression of bandits relies on military and political means, but especially on economic stability. Only after the economy is stable can the people live and work in peace. Bandit suppression relies on the front, but the elimination of communist spies in the rear is also important. Therefore, I hope that all patriotic party members of the district party branches in this city will mobilize, mobilize the masses, report unscrupulous merchants who raise prices, investigate communist spies lurking in this city, assist the government, eliminate traitors who undermine the new currency system, and bandits who destroy social order, so that society and the country can be peaceful." Finally, Fang also hoped that all party comrades and citizens in the city would investigate and report on communist spies and vocational students who are currently fleeing, so that this group of bookworms would not escape the net.

President Yu's Speech: Currency Reform is the Most Important

Then, President Yu of the Central Bank delivered a speech, saying: "Among the emergency measures taken by the government in finance and economy, currency reform is the most important. To have a financial solution, the currency system must be stable. To stabilize the currency system, the gold yuan is issued." He also said. The gold yuan has full reserves, but it still hopes for cooperation between the people and the government, that is, the people should fully trust the gold yuan, but this first lies in the trust of the comrades here. Yu then called on the comrades to pay attention to the communist bandits' attempts to undermine the government's new economic measures, and to assist the government in eliminating them.

Deputy Minister Emphasizes: Psychology Should Be Changed

After Yu's speech, Deputy Minister Tao gave a speech. Tao said: The success or failure of currency reform depends on whether the "consolidation of finance and control of the economy" is thoroughly implemented. Tao emphasized that "the psychology of the Chinese people should be changed." His conclusion said: "The quantity of gold yuan issued is secondary, the main thing is the psychology of the people." Tao made a clear explanation of the relationship between economic reform and the interests of the entire country and people, and hoped that Shanghai party members and citizens would have the greatest determination to complete this great task.

### Mayor Explains Two Points

When Mayor Wu spoke, he gave two explanations for the currency reform: (1) What if the currency system is not reformed? Wu used the fact that the municipal government, which has never relied on financial support from the central government, had to apply to the central government for financial subsidies in August as proof that the currency system must be reformed. (2) Have confidence in any method. Wu believes that this is not a time for criticism and empty talk, but a time for how to have confidence and strive to implement and complete the task.

### Speaker Believes: There Should Be Confidence

Finally, Speaker Pan explained that the current materials and gold yuan have the same value, and storing currency is like storing materials, believing that citizens should have unquestionable confidence in the new currency. The meeting ended at about 5:00.

### Jiang Jingguo and Others Meet to Review Economic Inspection Work

### September Rice Ration Possibly Maintained at Original Price; To Be Announced After Decision by Three-Person Team Tomorrow

[Reported by this newspaper] The price of rice rationed for September in this city will be announced by the three-person team at 5:00 PM tomorrow after the decision. Mayor Wu insisted that the price of rice in September must be converted into gold yuan at the original price in August to avoid stimulating price increases.

Students whose circumstances were serious were summoned. All summoned students will be investigated by the court's prosecutors at any time.

Recently, he wanted to exercise the landlord's rights to urge the dance hall to relocate immediately, but it was ineffective, so he filed a complaint with the District Court, which ruled that the Ciel Rouge dance hall should relocate within five months and granted provisional execution. Chen Guoqiang, the agent of the dance hall, refused to accept and applied to the High Court for appeal. The judgment was made a few days ago, canceling the original judgment of the first instance of the District Court, and Deng's application was rejected. Deng was responsible for the costs of the two lawsuits.

### Restrictions on Gauze Transport to the South and Export of Oil Materials: Shanghai Economic Management Supervision Office Formulates Measures

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the restrictions on the southward transport of gauze and the temporary suspension of exports of edible oils and oil materials, the Shanghai Economic Management Supervision Office of the Executive Yuan previously convened an emergency meeting and decided on this matter. It was also submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and authorization to promptly discuss and implement specific measures. It is now learned that the Shanghai Economic Management Supervision Office of the Executive Yuan has formulated two types of measures: "Provisional Management Measures for Restricting Gauze Transport to the South" and "Provisional Management Measures for Temporarily Suspending Exports of Edible Oils and Oil Materials." The details are recorded as follows:

Provisional Management Measures for Temporarily Suspending Exports of Edible Oils and Oil Materials:

(1) The Executive Yuan has specially formulated these measures to stabilize domestic edible oil prices, and the Shanghai Economic Management Supervision Office of the Executive Yuan will supervise and implement them.

(2) All peanut oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, rapeseed oil, and their raw materials are temporarily prohibited from being exported nationwide from September 1st.

(3) If there is a legitimate need for edible oil in the valleys of South China, to be transported from Shanghai to Guangdong and Fujian ports, manufacturers in Shanghai and South China may apply to the Import and Export Management Committee for allocation. After review and approval, an export permit will be issued and reported to the designated customs for transit.

(4) After the edible oil arrives at the ports of Guangdong and Fujian, the export permit should be submitted to the local customs for inspection. This edible oil is limited to local or provincial use and must not be re-exported.

(5) If other commercial ports outside Shanghai, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou, apply to purchase and transport edible oil to various parts of South China, they shall all be handled in accordance with the above provisions.

(6) Before the promulgation of these measures, if oil material exporters have already applied to the Import and Export Management Committee and have been approved by the committee to notify the customs for release, or hold a bank letter of credit and have registered with the Import and Export Management Committee, they are specially allowed to export within a limited time.

(7) These measures are temporarily limited to three months, after which they may be extended or abolished.

### Vegetable Vendors are Skilled at Raising Prices: Price Limits Still Need Strict Enforcement, Fish, Meat, and Vegetable Prices Have Not Become Cheaper

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] "The price limit should be six jiao!" A clear, loud voice with a heavy Ningbo accent broke through the noisy clamor from the "stall cluster" in a corner of the small vegetable market. Although I didn't know what goods and units of quantity the [price limit] she was referring to, I immediately recognized instinctively that this was clearly the stall owner's "farewell speech" because the transaction had not been successful. At the same time, her tone also contained another meaning: she was telling her customer, "The price limit is already six jiao, so I'm not charging you two million yuan (assuming) too much!"

This sentence is very representative of the general mentality of fish, meat, and vegetable vendors and some housewives in the small vegetable market these days. Based on their past experience, they know that there will be a "black market" after "price limits" are imposed, and they believe that "price limits" will not last for more than three to five days. So if they can rush to buy early, they can gain an advantage. Therefore, the meat business has been particularly prosperous these days.

Buying Meat Requires Buying Bones and Skin

Pork has returned from three million yuan per catty to two million and ten thousand yuan. Housewives feel that it is cheap and rush to buy it. Therefore, meat stalls take advantage of the situation. If you buy one catty of lean leg meat, they will force you to buy a four-liang meat bone. If you buy half a catty of ribs, they will throw in a two- or three-square-inch piece of skin. If you argue with them, they will shout loudly at you: "This is price-controlled meat, you can either take it or leave it!" A shrewd housewife, after being yelled at like that, and with people squeezing up from behind, also feels that what he said seems very reasonable, and doesn't bother to haggle any more, and buys it! Therefore, meat shop owners believe that selling "price-controlled meat" and adding bones and skin is a matter of course. At twelve o'clock noon, the small vegetable market has gradually calmed down. The meat stall owner pushes his empty frame all the way, calculating: "Three sevens are twenty-one, seven jiao equals two million and ten thousand. One catty of meat plus four liang of bone, twelve liang of meat sells for two million and ten thousand, seventeen thousand five hundred per liang. Haha! Isn't one catty still two million eight hundred thousand?" He smiled triumphantly.

Fish Prices Raised by Fifty Percent

A thin middle-aged man, wearing a white Hong Kong shirt and blue shorts, didn't look like a major supplier in a public office. He was probably a small clerk in a company or a low-level civil servant in a government agency, because there are very few men who go to the small vegetable market. I noticed him as soon as he walked into the small vegetable market. He walked around the vegetable market and took a fancy to the grass carp on a fish stall. When he asked the price, the stall owner replied casually: "Twelve thousand per liang." He felt that it seemed a bit too expensive and timidly said to the stall owner: "The price stipulated in the newspaper isn't that expensive." The stall owner asked with a justified air: "We all sell according to the price limit set by the Social Affairs Bureau. How much does the newspaper say?" The man was cornered by his questioning and couldn't answer for a moment. He turned around and slipped away as if to escape. Because I wanted to investigate the prices in the small vegetable market, I specially brought a copy of the price limit table published by the Social Affairs Bureau in this newspaper on the 27th. I secretly hid next to an egg shop to check. The prescribed wholesale price for grass carp was 63 yuan, 3 jiao and 3 fen (per dan). Adding 20% for legitimate retail profit, converting it to legal currency, and then using division to calculate the price per liang, it took almost more than twenty minutes to find the answer, which was 14,250 yuan per liang. The fish stall had raised the price by more than 50%, and still said that it was according to the price limit set by the Social Affairs Bureau. At that time, I was very angry and wanted to find a policeman to report him immediately. Then I suspected whether the answer I had calculated was accurate, because this was a rather complex calculation. If I was wrong, wouldn't I be making a fool of myself? With this thought, the courage to report him disappeared completely, and I silently left the fish stall.

Vegetable Prices Remain the Same

Although the Social Affairs Bureau limits the price to six fen and seven li per catty for green vegetables, five fen and seven li per catty for bean sprouts, and six fen and seven li per catty for edamame, the vegetable vendors are still asking twenty yuan per catty for green vegetables and edamame, and twenty-seven yuan per catty for bean sprouts. I was still thinking about the calculation of the legal currency price per liang of grass carp at 63 yuan, 3 jiao and 3 fen per dan, so I didn't have time to inquire in detail and hurriedly left the vegetable market.

### Attempting to Save a Train Ticket: A Young Man Commits a Crime and is Prosecuted

[Our Newspaper's Report] A young man named Jin Tianping, 19 years old, a local resident, lives at No. 383 Jianguo West Road. He previously studied at the Beiping Air Force School.

He was discovered by ticket inspector Su Ajin and taken to the Songshan Police Sub-bureau. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the identity card of the Air Force technician he was carrying was forged. According to Jin, he paid 30,000 yuan in legal currency to the Wenhua Typing School at No. 955 Zhongzheng East Road to type it, and spent 150,000 yuan to have the official seal carved by Xu Chengsheng Carving Shop at No. 2 Zhongzheng South Road. The sub-bureau transferred him to the local prosecutor's office for prosecution for forging documents.

### On the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Matters: Continued from Page Two, Weekly Forum

Sixth, according to Article 7 of the Measures for Handling Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies, people are allowed to continue to hold and transfer gold and silver jewelry. This is also a matter worth studying. Since gold and silver have been declared to be nationalized, while gold and silver jewelry can still be freely held and transferred, there may be loopholes. We need to know that it is not very difficult to turn gold and silver jewelry into gold and silver bars, and gold and silver bars into gold and silver jewelry. Is the government mobilizing personnel to monitor the jewelry industry nationwide for a long time? Or does the government trust that the jewelry industry nationwide will not have this phenomenon? The government allows people to hold and transfer gold and silver jewelry, perhaps to leave a way out for the jewelry industry; but since the raw materials of gold and silver in the jewelry industry have been taken back by the government and nationalized, future operations will also be extremely difficult. Moreover, before September 30, people can hardly guarantee that they will not entrust the jewelry industry to prepare jewelry items with gold and silver bars. Especially if the government sets gold and silver prices and a black market occurs, then people will not even consider selling gold and silver bars to the government. In addition to being cast into jewelry, they can also be secretly hidden. Does the government guarantee that there will be no such phenomenon? Therefore, while the government's nationalization of gold and silver is not controversial in principle, it still requires further detailed research on the technical aspects of implementation. In my opinion, the government does not need to nationalize silver for the time being, but must thoroughly implement the nationalization of gold, including gold jewelry and utensils. In this way, the jewelry industry can still maintain its existence, and all gold will be taught to be taken back by the government as a foreign exchange fund. After all, our country's silver was nationalized as a result of the implementation of the legal tender policy in 1935. Even if some people hoard silver coins and silver bars, the amount must be limited. Although gold was once nationalized during the war, the government later released a large amount of gold due to the implementation of the gold storage policy. After the war, during the tenure of Premier Song Ziwen, the government implemented a policy of selling gold, and the amount of gold released by the government was even greater. Later, due to the surge in domestic gold prices, the amount of gold smuggled in from overseas was also not small. Although the current domestic gold reserves cannot be accurately estimated, it is a credible fact that they have increased compared to before the War of Resistance. If the government can recover all the gold held by the people, it is believed that the foreign value of the gold yuan will become healthier. The government now calculates a fixed ratio of 200 gold yuan per tael. Unless the exchange rate of legal tender to gold yuan also changes, it must also be changed in order to absorb the gold held by the people. Some say that the gold yuan is being issued to purchase gold, which may affect the value of the gold yuan, but there is no need to consider this point, because gold has foreign payment value and is equivalent to foreign exchange, so it will not affect the value of the gold yuan itself. Here, I believe that if a black market is discovered, the government must increase the value of the gold yuan, that is, the exchange rate of 3 million legal tender to 1 gold yuan may be gradually increased to 3.5 million legal tender or 4 million legal tender to 1 gold yuan. This will also promote the early exchange of gold yuan by legal tender holders.

Seventh, regarding the measures for the registration and management of people's foreign exchange assets deposited abroad, the government aims to use them to stabilize the value of the gold yuan, but unfortunately there are no specific measures yet. There have been calls for borrowing people's assets abroad for several years, but the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly stated that there are difficulties in execution, and the main key is that foreign banks are restricted by law and cannot comply with the requirements of the Chinese government. Today, it is feared that it will also be difficult in fact to hope that people will voluntarily declare. I believe that can the government request the relevant countries, through diplomatic processes, to first freeze all overseas assets of Chinese people, just as the United States issued an order to freeze the assets of foreigners in the United States during the war? If the countries agree, then they can ask the countries, especially the United States, for loans, and the amount of the loans can be equal to the assets of Chinese people sealed in the country. Of course, Chinese living abroad for generations should be exceptions. At the same time, the government can still reward people in foreign assets into foreign currency and return to China, or welcome them to purchase foreign machinery, raw materials that are not available or lack in the country, and import them into the country, just like the recent government announced the measures for overseas Chinese investment and foreign funds in domestic production industries to import by reading, but conditions must be relaxed to encourage them.

Eighth, there are a total of 19 articles on measures to rectify finances and strengthen economic controls, but many of them are a kind of plan or direction, not a method, and a detailed method must still be formulated separately. For example, Article 2 stipulates adjusting tax rates to increase tax revenue, and the Ministry of Finance still needs to formulate specific measures separately; for example, Article 4 stipulates that the surplus of various state-owned enterprises should be handed over to the national treasury, and specific measures have also been formulated in detail; Article 5 stipulates that there are only 26 words for the sale of state-owned property, which can only be regarded as a principle, and how to sell it and seek its speedy completion has also been quickly and meticulously drafted. According to my opinion, a method for raising financial resources should be formulated separately according to Article 2, Article 4, and Article 5 of the law, which can be divided into three parts: one is to reorganize the tax system, the other is to sell state-owned property, and the third is to deal with the surplus of state-owned enterprises. The above three types, or methods can be formulated independently. Due to limited space here, I don't intend to make more detailed suggestions, but the formulation of other specific measures is absolutely necessary. For example, regarding the sale of state-owned property, the government has repeatedly issued laws and regulations, and part of it has been put into practice, but most of it has not been implemented to this day. There are not only technical problems in the middle, but also the problem of the joint sound of the entire government organization, and the concepts of the heads of various units are different, still obsessed with materials, and unwilling to sell them, which is a major reason. For example, the disposal of enemy and pseudo-property in the rebellious property must be executed after the final judgment of the court, and some traitors' cases have not been concluded from the end of the War of Resistance to the present day, so their rebellious property has not been sold. For example, there are many types of state-owned enterprises, with different natures, and whether their asset-liability reports are reasonable also needs to be studied.

In summary, the government's decisive decision to implement currency reform at this time when the suppression of the rebellion has not yet ended has indeed given the people a new impression. However, the law is most afraid of loopholes being discovered, and even more afraid of too many loopholes. The government announced four types of measures at the same time because of the implementation of currency reform, which means that the government's financial and economic policies have a systematic and holistic attention and vision, which can be said to be a great improvement over the previous partial policies. However, after a detailed study of all the measures, the places that need to be supplemented are as mentioned above. Fortunately, the president’s emergency decree on financial and economic matters still has the clear provision of "and authorizes the Executive Yuan to promulgate necessary regulations or supplementary measures for each of the measures to facilitate the implementation of this decree," and it is hoped that the Executive Yuan will utilize this clear provision to supplement it from the police.

Finally, what we must specifically mention is the statistics of national bank deposits and state bank treasury deposits, which is an important reference for currency reform. According to the report of the Audit Department of the Central Bank: the total amount of deposits in national commercial banks as of May of this year was 229,361 billion yuan; and the total amount of deposits in national banks and treasuries (including the Central Bank) as of March of this year was 646,8307 billion yuan. According to past growth rates, it is estimated that as of August 19 of this year, the total amount of deposits in national commercial banks was 60 trillion yuan, and the total amount of deposits in national banks and treasuries was 120 trillion yuan, totaling approximately 180 trillion yuan, and this 180 trillion yuan is only equivalent to 60 million gold yuan. Today, the actual value of gold yuan is only about five jiao of legal tender before the war, so the actual amount of legal tender deposits today is only 30 million yuan before the war. Looking back at the end of 1937, according to the statistics of the Four Joint Offices, the balance of various deposits in the four national banks and two bureaus alone was 2,112,800,000 yuan. Therefore, the actual total amount of deposits in the country today is only the mantissa of the total amount of deposits in national banks and bureaus in 1937! According to this fact, it is sufficient to prove the extent of the people's trust in legal tender, and it can be understood how rampant legal tender is in the material market, and how banks have lost their function as banks. Moreover, it can be known that the biggest reason for the devaluation of legal tender to its current level is really due to the people's distrust of legal tender, and this kind of distrust is exactly what ordinary people worry about!

Today, if we want the value of the gold yuan to remain stable for a long time, the government must first give full credit, full encouragement, and reward the national savings. If everyone can have the belief that "saving money is better than hoarding things," then prices can be stabilized, the currency value can be fixed, and life can return to normal. According to the estimates of the signatories, the government must control gold yuan deposits of 300 million yuan to 400 million yuan in national bank treasuries. Only in this way can it control national purchasing power, stabilize prices, and stabilize the currency system. This is what should be paid special attention to today when reforming the currency system (End).

### Yi Feng Jin Rice Store Violates Rice Rationing Laws: Commissioner of the People's Investigation Committee Announces Details

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the Yi Feng Jin Rice Store at No. 119 Nancang Street, Penglai District, was reported for rice rationing fraud, the rice store sent a letter requesting correction, roughly stating: "Since our store sold household rice, there has never been any fraud. The details reported by your newspaper are completely inconsistent with the facts. In addition to reporting to the People's Investigation Committee and the District Office, we hereby request correction." However, according to a report from the Dagong News reporter yesterday, who visited Mr. Si Pu, the commissioner of the People's Investigation Committee stationed in Penglai District, for details of the situation, it was said that according to the regulations of the Allocation Committee, the rice distribution for this month could only be completed by the 25th, and after the 25th, the distribution must be stopped and waited for the new price to be determined next month before applying to the People's Investigation Committee for allocation. I had repeatedly notified the rice stores in the district to comply in advance, but the rice store continued to distribute rice after the 25th, which is a violation of the law. Secondly, the source of the connected stacks of rice tickets is suspicious. I (Mr. Si claimed) have reported the detailed situation to the People's Food Allocation Committee in order to fulfill my responsibilities.

It is also learned that the Civil Affairs Bureau has also paid great attention after learning about this matter. Yesterday, the fourth section of the bureau sent staff to thoroughly investigate. Because the rice store has remitted some of the rice tickets, together with the rice payment, to the collection office of the Bank of China, it will go to the Bank of China for investigation again. In addition, the Penglai District People's Representative Council has also submitted a report to the government based on the facts at the time.

### Cradle of the Flat Glass Industry

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Han Qingtao

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Qinhuangdao, 24th] On the coast of Qinhuangdao, several chimneys stand tall, black smoke billowing from them. Beneath the chimneys stretches a row of factory buildings, where machines rumble loudly. Trains laden with sand and soil enter, while others emerge loaded with boxes of goods. This vibrant scene is none other than the "Yaohua" Flat Glass Manufacturing Plant, currently the only one of its kind in the country.

The name of this flat glass manufacturing plant is already well-known, as it boasts a long and distinguished history. It was established around the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924], funded by both Belgian and Chinese investors. This is now the temporarily inactive Factory No. 1 within the glass plant. Once the factory was built, flat glass production began in Qinhuangdao. Around the twentieth year of the Republic [1931], due to business needs, Factory No. 2 was built adjacent to Factory No. 1. At the time, Japanese traders, seeking to secure glass sales, frequently resorted to special influence and threats to stifle competition. After North China fell under Japanese control, in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic [1936], the Belgian investors sold their shares in Marseilles to the Japanese, transforming it into a Sino-Japanese joint venture glass company.

The Japanese, having realized their ambition, revamped Factory No. 2 and continued large-scale production of flat glass. After seven or eight years of Japanese control, the victorious horn of the fight against Japanese imperialism sounded. The Japanese shares were returned to the Chinese government, and soon after, the National Resources Commission took over management, transforming it into the present "National Resources Commission Joint-Operated Yaohua Glass Company." Zhang Xunjian serves as both the factory director and general manager.

During the restoration of the Northeast, most of the Japanese puppet organizations, factories, and homes were severely damaged. The demand for glass for repairs and reconstruction was considerable. At the time, apart from using the existing glass in the Northeast or adopting makeshift solutions, reliance was placed on Yaohua's production. Yaohua contributed significantly to the restoration efforts in the Northeast.

Today, the Northeast is largely isolated, but Yaohua's glass is supplied to North China, Central China, South China, West China, and even Taiwan. Recently, a batch of goods was sold by foreign merchants to the Dutch East Indies. Sales are very strong. The head office has branch offices in Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Taiwan, and other locations.

Currently, Factory No. 2 in Qinhuangdao is in operation. Originally, there were plans to restore and expand Factory No. 1 as well, but due to the area becoming a volatile border region, the original plan had to be put on hold for the future.

Manufacturing Process

The manufacturing process of flat glass involves transporting raw materials from various locations, grinding them into fine particles, and transferring them to a mixing machine. Once mixed, the materials enter large melting furnaces, fueled by gas generators. They are heated to extremely high temperatures, exceeding 1600 degrees Celsius, causing the glass materials to turn into liquid. At this stage, eight drawing machines lift the glass solution from the vat to the third floor, forming large sheets of glass. The thickness and thinness of the glass are predetermined. Workers then cut the cooled wide or thin sheets into the required sizes.

From the preparation of raw materials to the completion of glass manufacturing, three transformers convert the electricity supplied by Kailuan Mining into power for the various working departments. Currently, approximately 4,600 to 4,700 kilowatt-hours of electricity are sufficient for daily operations. Additionally, four ordinary boilers provide steam for the working procedures, and the main coal-fired gas generators consume hundreds of tons of coal daily.

Main Raw Materials

The main raw material, silica sand, is mostly sourced from Xiamen. Ships carrying three to four thousand tons of silica sand can reach Qinhuangdao in four days. Huanhaisi in Suizhong County, Western Liaoning, also produces silica sand called quartzite, which is unweathered and of high quality. However, due to the difficulty of transporting less than one ton of quartzite per cart to the railway line, coupled with low mining volumes, Yaohua has no choice but to seek supplies from afar. The current monthly demand for silica sand is one thousand four to five hundred tons.

In addition, four to five hundred tons of pure alkali from "Yongli" in Tanggu, six to seven hundred tons of limestone from Guye, five to six hundred tons of dolomite from Beiping, and over one hundred tons of mirabilite from Hangu are also required each month. If transportation becomes problematic in the future, there seems to be potential to find many glass manufacturing raw materials in the Beidaihe area.

Yaohua is currently operating most of its machines, with a daily glass production of approximately one thousand standard cases. According to their established practice, each standard case is calculated based on one hundred square feet of flat glass that is 2MM thick. The current machine capacity can produce glass with a maximum size of 100x72 inches, a maximum thickness of 6MM, and a minimum thickness of 1.9MM or 2MM. Yaohua's flat glass production in the first half of this year was over 180,000 standard cases.

Quality Assessment

It is said that the quality of Yaohua's current glass production is superior to that during the Japanese management era. The best qualities of flat glass are "flatness" and "whiteness." Currently, due to less-than-ideal raw materials, the glass still has some slight blue-green tint, but many people in the market say, "This is much better than the slightly yellow glass from America. A slight blue-green tint is what employers prefer."

The Yaohua Glass Factory has decided to stop the furnace for cold repairs in early September. The cold repair period is scheduled for three months, and glass manufacturing can be resumed by the end of November. This is a routine task that is carried out approximately every year and a half. It is said that the current inventory is sufficient to supply the market for more than three months.

Yaohua has established a branch factory near Longhua Airport in Shanghai, and General Manager Zhang Xunjian is currently overseeing matters in Shanghai. At present, the factory's construction equipment is 80-90% complete. Flat glass production is expected to begin around October of this year, with an estimated daily output of three hundred standard cases. This equipment was previously allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and was intended to be utilized in the South.

Factory Construction

The Qinhuangdao factory is now undertaking an internal construction project, which involves the successful design and installation of a waste heat boiler by Factory Director Xi and Engineering Section Chief Zhang Xia, etc. Another one will be built. This involves absorbing the hot gas from the large melting furnace chimney into the waste heat boiler, and then sending the absorbed heat back to the large melting furnace for repeated use. Installing that waste heat boiler has eliminated the need to burn some ordinary boilers, and it can save nine tons of coal per day.

Yaohua Glass Factory currently employs over eight hundred and seventy workers. The compensation is slightly better than that of "Kailuan Mining." Flour, coal, and other goods are distributed in kind each month, and if there are no rewards, they are converted into cash. There are over seventy staff members, whose compensation is also slightly better than that of ordinary civil servants. Outside the Yaohua factory, there are also numerous orderly stone-walled residential houses owned by the provincial employees, providing stable living and working conditions, which should enhance their work ethic.

### Investigation Report on the July 5th Incident (Continued and Completed)

B. Analysis of the July 5th Incident

1.  The primary cause of the student riots during the July 5th Incident was the students' petition and subsequent destruction of the Senate. Thousands of passionate young students traveled to Beiping at the risk of their lives, facing difficulties with food and lodging, and with dim prospects for education. Their pent-up frustration and indignation had no outlet. The Senate's proposed emergency measures for the relief of Northeast students in Beiping served as a catalyst for this unfortunate incident. While the students claimed to have waited at the Senate for two to three hours to present their petition, only to be met with no one willing to receive them, leading to their destructive actions (see Attachment No. 6), the statements of Bai Shiwei, Zhang Shouxin, and others indicated that around 7:00 AM on July 5th, three to four thousand students gathered and ran to the Senate. By 8:00 AM, they had already entered and destroyed the various rooms, then sat in the middle of the road for two to three hours, and around 11:00 AM, they caused destruction again. Furthermore, they shouted slogans along the way, such as "Anti-hunger, anti-persecution," which were commonly used by the communists. This overstepping of boundaries was highly inappropriate.

The Question of Gunfire

2.  The Question of the First Shot: On that day, a gunshot triggered a chain reaction, with soldiers subsequently opening fire. However, the origin of this first shot remains unclear. According to Bai Shiwei, Cheng Qizhi, Chen Guohui, and others, the shot came "from outside the east entrance," "a sudden sound rang out from the student group on the left," and "a gunshot was faintly heard from the student group to the east, behind." Furthermore, Ms. Wang, an eyewitness present at the scene, stated, "I was in the hall on the upper floor, facing west of the Xu residence, when I saw the first shot fired from the student crowd." Additionally, a dispatch from Agence France-Presse to Nanjing stated, "The Youth Army indeed returned fire outside Chairman Xu's residence because the students had fired first." Based on these accounts, it appears that the first shot came from the student crowd. However, the students insisted that the first shot was fired by an officer wearing riding boots inside the paifang. Both sides held their ground, and no definitive proof could be established. However, when the students were petitioning in front of Vice President Li's official residence, an Associated Press reporter, an American named Bolton, noted that when the student representative conveyed Vice President Li's response, he observed unusual movements among the students in the front row, who did not seem to be from the Northeast. Before the representative could finish speaking, they raised their hands and shouted, "Oppose! Oppose!" This suggests that there were undesirable elements mixed in with the student crowd, who fired a shot as the students were about to disperse, creating a bloody tragedy in order to escalate the incident. Furthermore, when student Wang Da retrieved the gun that Zhang Nairen had dropped and returned it, one bullet was missing, raising suspicions that it might have been used to fire the first shot. However, repeated questioning by the court failed to produce conclusive evidence.

3.  The Question of Shooting at the Students: Following the first shot, soldiers from the 208th Division's search battalion opened fire with various types of firearms. After several visits to the scene, investigations revealed numerous bullet marks on the brick walls north of the paifang. The situation suggested that the soldiers were firing at the walls to intimidate the students. Occasionally, stray bullets or ricochets might have flown out, causing student casualties. Otherwise, if the soldiers had intentionally targeted the students, one bullet could have hit six or seven people in the densely packed crowd. With hundreds of shots fired, the number of student deaths and injuries would have been unimaginable. Regarding the shooting, 208th Division Commander Duan Yun stated, "Our division does not have dumdum bullets or armor-piercing bullets. Many of the student injuries involved a type of bullet, but inspections of the utility poles and iron bars, which were just over two fen thick, showed that any rifle could easily penetrate them at close range, let alone a machine gun. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the students were actually injured by dumdum bullets." The results of the district prosecutor's examination only indicated injuries caused by non-jacketed bullets. In terms of the troops present on the scene that day, apart from the 208th Division, which was fully armed, the police and security guards were all inside the courtyard. Under the watchful eyes of everyone, all relevant individuals questioned saw soldiers from the 208th Division's search battalion opening fire. Even the battalion commander of the division, Zhao Changyan, admitted that the shooting occurred because students were trying to seize guns, but he did not deny that shooting occurred. The division commander's attempt to evade responsibility for the shooting by claiming that his division did not have such bullets is simply not credible. Furthermore, Liu Jingguo, the deputy company commander of the armored vehicle unit from the rapid-response company that participated in the on-site guard, immediately requested that Wang Fu'an, a staff officer from the Garrison Headquarters, inspect the armored vehicle to determine whether it had fired. Staff Officer Wang confirmed this in his written certification, which stated, "This is to certify that on July 5th, at approximately 19:00, in front of Chairman Xu's residence in Dongjiaominxiang, the 208th Division and Northeast students exchanged fire. Song Fa, an armored vehicle assigned to guard duty, fired one shot." Zhang Shouxin, the director of the Seventh Precinct who was also present at the scene, also testified that the armored vehicle did not fire, and that the shooting was carried out by soldiers from the 208th Division's search battalion, leaving no room for doubt.

The Question of Gun Seizure

4.  The Question of Gun Seizure by Students: According to Battalion Commander Zhao Changyan, "After the gunshot was fired from the student side, the students swarmed forward and attempted to seize guns. Two of our soldiers were isolated and surrounded. At this time, our two soldiers, Li Shikui and Li Yinlin, who were armed with submachine guns, fired into the air to prevent unlawful infringement." According to Zhao, the shooting was in self-defense because the students were seizing guns. However, according to Wang Yucai, the commander of the armored vehicle who was present at the scene, "The students were all eight or nine steps outside the paifang. There were no students inside the paifang. There were no students between the Youth Army soldiers and the paifang." He also stated, "There was no conflict between the students and the soldiers. I did not see any soldiers rushing out of the paifang. They maintained their original positions throughout. After the gunfire, the students lay down. They did not rush inside the brick paifang's cordon." Furthermore, according to Wang Fu'an, a staff officer from the Garrison Headquarters who was present at the scene, "The students were all lying down. The students were outside the paifang, and the soldiers did not leave the paifang." According to Bolton, an American reporter from the Associated Press, "When the gunfire occurred, the students did not move inward. I did not see any attempt to seize guns." Ms. Bauer, from the Pacific Society, stated, "There was absolutely no conflict between the military police and the students." Based on these accounts, the students and soldiers were facing each other across the paifang, with a certain distance between them. There was absolutely no conflict. The claim of surrounding the outpost and seizing guns is simply not credible.

The Question of Missing Soldiers

5.  The Question of Missing Soldiers: According to news reports, the security authorities announced the deaths of two soldiers, Li Shikui and Li Yinhuai, and the loss of two handguns. According to Division Commander Duan, "When the order was disrupted, the two soldiers at the front, Li Shikui and Li Yinhuai, were suddenly surrounded and taken away by the crowd, along with their guns. They were also carrying two handguns, along with their bullets, which are also missing. We believe that the two soldiers have been secretly executed and the guns and ammunition hidden." According to Battalion Commander Zhao, "These two soldiers clashed with the students when the gunfire occurred and were abducted by the students and went missing." According to the accounts of Duan and Zhao, two soldiers and two guns went missing that day, but (1) there was no search for the students or questioning about the missing soldiers, (2) the highest commanding officer was not informed, (3) Staff Officer Yang of the Garrison Headquarters was not informed when he inspected the scene, and (4) the 208th Division did not submit a written report to the Garrison Headquarters until a week later. Based on these four reasons, the disappearance of the soldiers is highly questionable. Given the statements of various parties proving that there was no conflict between the students and the soldiers, and the situation at the scene, the positions of the two sides, there was a considerable distance between them. Since there was no possibility of approach, how could there have been any encirclement of soldiers and seizure of firearms? Moreover, since the entire city was under martial law at the time, it would have been impossible for students to carry firearms through the city, let alone secretly execute soldiers. The bodies have never been found. To hastily declare that the two soldiers were included in the death toll, the missing detail is difficult to believe.

Investigation of Casualties

6.  Student Casualties: (1) According to a report from Zhang Shouxin, director of the Seventh Precinct, "Three students died at the scene: Sun Dexin, Wu Zhaotai, and Han Delin. Two died from serious injuries at the Beiping Municipal Hospital: Xu Guochang and Bu Hongxun. One died at Tongren Hospital: He Shouzhi. Fourteen students were injured, including Huang Baowen, Li Zuozhou, Wang Hanjiang, Zheng Yuchun (female), Xu Shaoxue, Tian Bingchang, Zhang Xuechang, Liu Shitian, Qin Zaixing, Zhang Guocheng, Yang Zhenzong, Wang Quan, Yang Yunlong, and Li Fuwei (Yang and Li also died in the hospital). One civilian, Zhang Mingling, was also injured, bringing the total number of casualties to 21." (2) According to a report from Court Prosecutor Ji Yuan, "The number of deaths and injuries verified is the same as above." (3) According to the police department's investigation of the injuries and deaths of students in the July 5th incident, "There were nine deaths and nineteen injuries (including minor injuries), for a total of 28." Based on the above, there were 8 student deaths, 1 merchant death, and 19 student injuries (including minor and serious injuries), for a total of 28. After investigation and verification by various parties, this should be the accurate number.

Responsibility

C. Responsibility for the July 5th Incident: Combining the statements of various parties and the data collected through investigation, an assessment of the actual situation at the scene, and a judgment of the responsibility of the relevant personnel involved in the case, are listed below:

1.  Chen Jicheng, the commander-in-chief of the Beiping Garrison, bore the responsibility for maintaining public order and, recognizing the severity of the situation, had the duty to be on standby and deploy troops for guard duty at any time. However, it was heard that Chen telephoned General Commander Fu to request that troops be dispatched for security. General Commander Fu instructed by telephone that soldiers were not allowed to carry guns, let alone hit students. Soldiers who were injured or killed would be heavily compensated. He also ordered his chief of staff to telephone Garrison Headquarters Staff Officer Yang, ordering him to convey General Commander Chen's instructions, emphasizing that the officers and soldiers were not allowed to fire guns. As a last resort, for defensive purposes, they could fire into the air to avoid bloodshed. Analyzing the above situation, Commander-in-Chief Chen failed to follow General Commander Fu's instructions and inappropriately deployed the combat troops of the Youth Army to suppress the student unrest. Given the possibility that both the troops and the students could trigger an incident at any time, the guarding troops on site included the 208th Division's search battalion, the 6th Armored Vehicle Battalion, the 19th Gendarmerie Regiment, the police, and the security police force. With such a vast and complex force, Deputy Director Bai Shiwei of the Police Bureau was appointed as the supreme commander. While the police would certainly obey orders, it was impossible for the army to follow his command. According to Bai's statement, "In a few seconds, gunshots rang out from both the east and west sides. I shouted loudly not to open fire, but no one paid attention." This clearly indicates that they did not listen to Bai's command. The Commander-in-Chief, judging the situation rationally, bore the responsibility for improper handling of this unfortunate incident.

2.  Zhao Changyan, the battalion commander of the 208th Division's search battalion, was ordered to be on guard and was under the command of Deputy Director Bai Shiwei of the Police Bureau, but all his actions were not in accordance with Bai's orders. Observing his on-site deployment, it was completely in a combat-ready state, with machine gunners lying prone and ready to fire. Five minutes before the incident, Mr. Borred of the US Embassy witnessed the situation of the students on the east side, noting that there were only over two hundred people remaining, all preparing to return, with no tense atmosphere. This unnecessary tension was the main cause of the incident. Furthermore, he did not immediately stop the soldiers from opening fire, leading to an unprecedented tragedy. He also shirked his responsibility with untrustworthy statements about two missing soldiers, which was absurd. The battalion commander should bear the legal responsibility for condoning the murder of civilians.

3.  Bai Shiwei, the deputy director of the police bureau, was ordered by Commander-in-Chief Chen to be the commander of the military police in Dongjiaominxiang. According to Bai, "I arrived inside Gate No. 1 in an armored vehicle around 5:00 PM and saw the soldiers of the 208th Division sitting down and resting against the back wall of Gate No. 1. I thought this was very appropriate, so I went out of Gate No. 1 to the west and saw twenty or so armed soldiers patrolling. I was very surprised. Who ordered the soldiers to move without my consent?" From the above, it is clear that Bai failed to exercise his authority. If Bai had arrived and repeatedly warned the soldiers not to open fire to avoid bloodshed, and upon seeing the armed soldiers patrolling, he should have inquired as to whose orders they were following, and he should have also provided practical instructions to Battalion Commander Zhao to restrain the soldiers. Bai failed to do this, despite bearing the heavy responsibility of commander. He spent the day traveling back and forth between the municipal government and the Garrison Headquarters, rather than monitoring the soldiers' actions on the front line of the guard. Even though the 208th Division's troops were disobedient, he should have reported to Commander-in-Chief Chen as soon as possible and requested that another commander be dispatched to avoid delaying matters. When the student representatives accepted the conditions, he did not first inform the officers and soldiers of the news that the students were about to leave, only paying attention to the student side, leading to the tragic incident due to misunderstanding. The deputy director was negligent in handling matters, failed to provide effective command, and was derelict in his duties.

I was ordered to investigate the actual situation of the July 5th incident, and I hereby submit this report with relevant attachments, requesting your review. (End of full text)

### An Overview of Taiwan's National Economy

— Special Correspondent Wu Shouren

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 26th dispatch] Judging from various statistics, Taiwan's agricultural economy, interwoven with grain and sugar, should be far more prosperous than what we see and hear today. Why does the reporter say this? Because during my two hundred-plus days in Taiwan, I repeatedly visited rural villages, contacted farmers who constitute the highest proportion of the Taiwanese population, and even shared their joys and sorrows. Frankly speaking, they all felt that life was becoming increasingly difficult.

High Productivity

The Taiwanese people, due to their ancestral heritage, feel a spiritual warmth and closeness from reality. It is this spiritual enjoyment related to kinship that allows them to compensate for the hardships in their material lives and be content with reality. The formation of this feeling undoubtedly makes us realize a lesson: that an agricultural economy, relying solely on high production figures to achieve a prosperous life, although not absolutely impossible, requires strict planning for allocation; otherwise, it is extremely difficult, especially when production figures are not at their highest. However, even if we take a step back, the lives of Taiwanese compatriots today are, objectively speaking, more stable than those of people in the mainland. At least, anyone who works can maintain a decent standard of living. However, why do they still feel that life is difficult? The reporter believes that psychological preconceptions are worth noting. They know that what they obtained in the past was merely leftover from the Japanese. Therefore, after returning to the motherland, they immediately ignited the hope of a more prosperous life than before. They feel that this hope should be a matter of course. Little do they know that in the past three years, the world situation has remained tense, and domestic warfare has not ceased. Not only has the reconstruction work not been completed, but the destruction is even greater than during the War of Resistance, with inflation and economic crises reaching extreme levels. Taiwan is a part of China, and it has been affected by the mainland. Achieving stability is not easy, let alone hoping for a living standard exceeding that of pre-war times. From the government's perspective, the efforts devoted to stabilizing the lives of Taiwanese compatriots in the past three years can be said to be quite significant. The most obvious example is the creation of a different currency system from the mainland, compared to the government's measure of treating the recovered areas' puppet currency at a rate of 200 to 1 against the legal tender. The difference in treatment is incomparable. Perhaps the Taiwanese people do not feel any special favor in this, but mainland compatriots feel a great disparity in hardship and happiness. Why can't the Taiwanese people directly appreciate the government's painstaking efforts regarding this excellent currency system? There should be a reason: that they know that maintaining the value of the Taiwan dollar does not depend on any funds given by the central government, but entirely on the original resources of the province, which makes them feel that this is a matter of course.

Taiwan Dollar Utilization

Regarding the existence of the Taiwan dollar, there are many criticisms in mainland society, and some even doubt its basis. In fact, there is nothing mysterious about the basis of the Taiwan dollar. It provides the central government with 40% of its issuance amount in the form of Taiwan sugar and 60% in loan notes as reserve funds. The value of Taiwan sugar follows other commodity prices, which also increases the value of the Taiwan dollar. As for the issuance amount, according to the Taiwan Bank's settlement at the end of June, it was more than 35 billion yuan. The reporter said earlier that the government has devoted considerable efforts to stabilizing the lives of Taiwanese compatriots, which is based on the utilization of the aforementioned Taiwan dollar issuance amount. I think the issue of utilizing this over 10 billion yuan of Taiwan dollars should be of concern to the mainland financial community, and Taiwanese compatriots also hope to know about it. According to the statistics of the Taiwan Bank, 70% of this 35 billion yuan is used for industrial, mining, agricultural, production, and water conservancy construction funds, and 30% is used for administrative expenses and commercial loans. From this utilization method, we can roughly see a circulation rate, that is, Taiwan's local production supports the existence of the Taiwan dollar, and the issuance of the Taiwan dollar is used for re-production. Therefore, the more production, the stronger the foundation of the Taiwan dollar, and the more stable the people's lives.

However, it is also a fact that Taiwanese compatriots today are not only dissatisfied with the current living situation but also feel hardship. We should not completely attribute this to psychological preconceptions and ignore the facts. To study this issue, we must focus on the entire economic system of Taiwanese society. As the reporter mentioned earlier, Taiwan's economic system is based on agricultural economy and supplemented by industrial economy. In fact, the phrase "supplemented by industrial economy" is a polite way of speaking. May I ask what industries Taiwan has? Especially those related to people's livelihood, we can hardly list any. Everyone knows that in modern society, humans cannot sustain their lives by food alone. Among the four essential elements of life, besides food, there are also clothing, housing, and transportation. The importance of these three elements in the history of human life is equal to that of food. Therefore, what we see today, that Taiwan's agricultural production is so abundant, is really not enough to symbolize the prosperity of the lives of Taiwanese compatriots.

Grain Control

However, there is one point that the reporter wants to specifically point out: the Taiwan Provincial Government's management of food can be said to be 100% successful. Among the province's 6.5 million people, no one wants to get rich by hoarding food. The formation of this excellent traditional atmosphere should be entirely attributed to effective management. The reporter briefly lists its main points: first, the order prohibiting the export of food is strictly enforced; second, the food administration authorities purchase surplus grain from large households, holding sufficient physical goods. These two points can be said to be the key points of the Taiwan Provincial Government's food policy. Of course, it is not surprising to say it, but because it is well and thoroughly implemented, it has exerted supreme effectiveness. Separately, the first point, the so-called prohibition of export, of course refers to the private sector. The remaining grain cannot be discarded but is managed by the government as a whole and entirely supplied to the central government for exchanging fertilizer, which is used for re-production. The second point, the method of purchasing surplus grain from large households, on the one hand, prevents the people from accumulating more than they need, and on the other hand, the government holds physical goods to supply people without grain for fixed household rations and public and education personnel rations. Secondly, when grain prices fluctuate, they are sold in large quantities in consumption areas. Therefore, when the reporter arrived in Taiwan in early December last year, the grain price was about 50 yuan per catty. After more than half a year until now, it is only 110 yuan, with an increase rate of slightly less than one time. The reason why Taiwanese compatriots can live stably is due to this. However, on the other hand, the reason why they feel that life is becoming increasingly difficult is also due to this. The reader may find the reporter's seemingly contradictory assessment strange, but in fact, there is a great truth in it.

Economic Policy

Taiwan is an agricultural economy society. In an agricultural economy society, farmers naturally constitute the absolute majority. According to official statistics, among the province's 6.5 million people, farmers account for slightly less than two-thirds. It is beyond doubt that this vast group of people relies entirely on agricultural products to supply their four essential elements of life. Let us compare the increase rate of clothing, housing, and transportation in the past six months with the increase rate of grain. The degree of disparity is unbelievable. The reporter wants to point out that the expenses of clothing and transportation in Taiwan are much higher than in the mainland, especially clothing, because the cloth is transported from the mainland, which is 50% to 100% more expensive than in Shanghai. As for transportation, except for public buses, it is also much more expensive than in the mainland. However, since it has little relation to the lives of most farmers, we can ignore it for the time being. But clothing is necessary to cover the body, and it cannot be saved. Farmers exchange low-priced agricultural products that are cheaper than those on the mainland for expensive clothing that is higher in price than those on the mainland. The consumption ratio is truly astonishing. How can farmers not feel that life is becoming increasingly difficult? However, the reporter does not mean that low grain prices hurt farmers, but feels that there is a shortcoming: that the Taiwan Provincial Government does not have an economic policy that matches the food policy, which inevitably makes people feel like there is a headache when the head hurts.

Comprehensive Rationing

The provincial government authorities should not be afraid of difficulties and wait and see. In fact, this kind of economic policy that matches the food policy is not that difficult as long as it seeks truth from facts. The reporter is willing to point out a major path from the perspective of focusing on people's livelihood, which is to implement comprehensive rationing of daily necessities. The reporter dares to boldly say that implementing comprehensive rationing of daily necessities is the focus of the economic policy that matches the food policy, which is what the 6.5 million compatriots in Taiwan and more than ten thousand mainland compatriots traveling to Taiwan are yearning for.

In fact, the reporter does not mean that the provincial government authorities lack measures to match the food policy. For example, the distribution of fertilizer adopts a subsidy method to achieve the purpose of reducing production costs, which should be an important measure to fully match the food policy. However, in today's distorted economic situation, reducing production costs is not the most reasonable and complete way to maintain the price of certain products, especially in an agricultural economy society. Reducing the production costs of agricultural products to maintain the price of agricultural products is definitely not thorough enough, and of course, it is not a permanent plan to maintain the stable life of this society. I think Taiwanese and mainland economists will definitely not deny this statement. (The End)

### Strange Corpse Case Discovered on Pingnan Changjie: Muscles Decayed, Maggots Crawling, Handkerchief Embroidered with the Words "Zhu Yongchuan"

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th dispatch] A bizarre murder case was discovered at No. 1 Nanhua Lane, Pingnan Changjie. The resident downstairs at No. 1 is Wang Huanting, deputy director of the Inspection Department of the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, and the resident upstairs is Wang Miansheng, deputy director of the Supply Department of the Shanghai Air Force Headquarters. A strange corpse was suddenly discovered on the small platform on the roof. The muscles had decayed almost completely, leaving only a pile of white bones. The upper body was wearing a white-striped shirt, and the lower body was wearing black rubber shoes. Maggots were crawling everywhere, which was extremely terrible. A white cloth handkerchief was left beside the corpse, embroidered with an English name, which could be translated as "Zhu Yongchuan." When the court examined the corpse, it questioned the landlords upstairs and downstairs in detail. Although there were no significant leads, it is widely believed that there must be a bizarre and tortuous hidden situation behind it. The security and judicial authorities are determined to solve the case in the short term.

### Remnant Bandits from Liuheng Island Fled to Eastern Yin: Police and Militia Rushed to Intercept Them at Night

[Our Newspaper, Zheng County, 29th dispatch] More than 200 sea bandits led by Wang Yunxuan were entrenched in Liuheng, Dinghai. After General Tang Enbo, director of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters, personally led the police and militia to encircle and suppress them, more than half of the bandits were killed. They fled in batches and then attempted to land on the border of Meishan, Zhenhai. County Magistrate Jiang led his troops to Chaibao area to suppress them. At about 4 p.m. on the 28th, the bandits (number unknown) landed from Sanshan Zhi'ao and other places and invaded Shaobailing through Tiantong, Yin County. Police Chief Wang Yuebin of Yindong Police Station reported this and immediately led his troops to defend and intercept them. He also telegraphed the Yin Police Bureau to send Wang, the captain of the Second Security Police Company, to lead the team to intercept them at night.

[Another Central News Agency dispatch] The Political Work Office of the First Military Region of the Navy reported that the mountain bandits and soldiers on Liuheng Mountain, Dinghai, East Zhejiang, had no way to escape, and their casualties were extremely tragic. In this battle, more than 70 bandits were killed, more than 60 were captured, one bandit ship was seized, and many firearms and documents were obtained. The area is currently undergoing a clearance. On the 23rd, Director Tang took the Lian Guang warship to Ningbo and then to Hangzhou, and the captured bandits were also escorted to Hangzhou for trial.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th dispatch] Haiyan, Haining, and Pinghu counties in Zhejiang Province are located along the coast. Zhaipu is strategically important, and sea bandits often appear there. The Haining County Council specially telegraphed the Provincial Security Command to dispatch gunboats to patrol regularly to prevent banditry and protect the coastal security of the three counties. The Provincial Security Department has forwarded it to the Weizhou Pacification Department for verification and approval.

### Miniature News

Zhenjiang [Our Newspaper] The Central Government of Jiangsu Province ordered the collection of one levy and one loan for this year's field tax. Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong and He Yushu, director of the Field Grain Department, have visited Beijing several times to discuss with the Grain Ministry and requested a reduction to one levy and a half loan to alleviate the difficulties of the people of Jiangsu. All such cases were taken as a general rule, and no reduction was possible. It is reported that the collection of this year's field tax is imminent, and the counties urgently need to resolve the levy and loan issue in order to prepare for collection. They have sent telegrams to the province for instructions. In order to avoid affecting the collection, Chairman Wang has decided to go to Beijing in person within one or two days to conduct a final discussion with the Ministry of Food. The amount proposed this time is one levy and 0.8 loan, which may be approved by the Central Government.

Kunshan [Our Newspaper] The local council recently decided on the surcharge rate for this year's field tax, which is 6 liters of rice per yuan of tax, and sent it to the county government for reporting to the province for approval.

Jiaxing [Our Newspaper] The continuous rain and floods caused the river water to rise steeply by four or five feet, causing the harvested early rice to sprout and grow an inch or so. The late rice in Sande, Chengxi, and Changxing areas was mostly submerged, making it difficult to bail out. Therefore, each area has requested to report to the province for tax reduction.

Jinhua [Our Newspaper] Ni Xiong, chief of staff and commander of the Sixth Detachment of Ying Fei's bandit group in eastern Zhejiang, whose original name was Chen Jiajin, was captured at the Jiang location in the city a few days ago. After interrogation confirmed his identity, he was sent by the Jinhua County Police Bureau to the Eighth District Security Command for punishment according to law.

### General Prices: Actively Controlling the Market, the Response is Very Good

This past week was the first week after the implementation of the new economic plan. In order to promote the implementation of the new plan, the authorities suddenly became active and tense in controlling the market. Under this tense situation, the market response was very good. Over the past week, there has not been any occurrence of prices exceeding the price limits of August 19th. However, based on years of experience, control is only a "stop flow" method for prices. "Stop flow" has its limits, and when the water is full, it will still burst out. Therefore, how to do the second step of dredging is an imminent matter.

The general trend of market prices last week was that, due to the market closure on the previous Friday, Saturday, and the three-day weekend, the market opened on Monday, and people were panic-stricken. National banks stopped lending, and commercial firms were busy managing their own funds and unwilling to lend out. The prices of various commodities generally fell by about half a percent to one percent compared to the prices on August 19th.

However, after Tuesday, due to the loose money supply and the change in people's minds, the market situation was somewhat different. Many prices returned to the price limits of August 19th, and there were few transactions. This situation cannot reflect the natural level of commodity prices. It somewhat explains the people's behavior of still expecting prices to rise but not daring to violate the law. Therefore, after the government's "stop flow" method is successful, it must quickly come up with dredging methods, not only having a stagnant market within the August 19th price limits, but also having a large number of transactions within the August 19th price limits, so that commodity prices can be said to be truly stable.

The money supply in the market last week was unusually loose. The national bank's exchange on Monday showed a difference of more than 5 million gold yuan, equivalent to more than 150 billion legal currency, creating an unprecedented record.

After Tuesday, there were also continued large differences. According to analysis, this was due to commercial firms absorbing commercial notes on the market and the central bank returning the funds of the note reserve, as well as funds from treasury bills and gold and U.S. dollars exchanged with the central bank.

Director Lin of the Gold Management Bureau said: "According to reports from all parties, the deposits of banks and firms have increased by 50%." Market interest rates have been falling frequently, from over 6 jiao at the beginning of the week to below 1 jiao at the weekend. This situation is indeed a good phenomenon that has not been seen for many years since the Anti-Japanese War and the victory. However, we are both happy and fearful about this good phenomenon, because if floating capital cannot quickly find a legitimate outlet, it may hide a new crisis.

Starting last week, the national banks redeemed gold, silver, and foreign currencies. The exchange situation in the city and other places was very enthusiastic. According to the Central Bank's announcement, the exchange figures for this city are as follows: On Monday, a total of 7,748 taels, 3 qian, and 6 fen of gold, 8,776 taels, 9 qian, 6 fen, and 3 li of silver, 28,361 silver dollars, 819,631 U.S. dollars and 50 cents, and 136,702 Hong Kong dollars were collected, totaling 5,013,777 gold yuan, 3 jiao, and 9 fen.

On Tuesday, a total of 17,128 taels, 6 qian, 9 fen, and 6 li of gold, 11,495 taels, 4 qian, 7 fen, and 9 li of silver, 47,243 silver dollars, 1,288,317 U.S. dollars, 65 cents, and 575,130 Hong Kong dollars and 10 cents were collected, totaling 9,179,707 gold yuan, 7 jiao, and 5 fen.

On Wednesday, a total of 27,071 taels, 4 qian, 8 fen, and 9 li of gold, 26,125 taels, 2 qian, 3 fen, and 7 li of silver, 67,261 silver dollars, 1,029,065 U.S. dollars, 48 cents, and 495,447 Hong Kong dollars and 8 jiao were collected, totaling 10,115,243 gold yuan, 2 jiao, and 8 fen.

On Thursday, a total of 32,585 taels, 5 qian, 4 fen, and 6 li of gold, 25,116 taels, 9 qian, and 9 fen of silver, 86,263 silver dollars, 787,498 U.S. dollars, 28 cents, and 421,767 Hong Kong dollars and 5 fen were collected, totaling 10,231,304 gold yuan, 5 jiao, and 7 fen.

Friday was a regular holiday and there was no market. On Saturday, a total of 33,966 taels, 1 qian, and 8 fen of gold, 29,202 taels, and 4 fen and 7 tong of silver, 95,236 silver dollars and 50 cents, 888,353 U.S. dollars and 24 cents, and 299,955 Hong Kong dollars and 65 cents were collected, totaling 10,849,680 gold yuan, 0 jiao, and 4 fen. From the 23rd to the 28th, a total of 45,389,713 gold yuan, 4 jiao, and 4 fen were exchanged.

The authorities, in order to promote the new economic plan, established the Economic Control Committee in the area of economic control, which is worthy of mention. The committee is headed by President Weng of the Executive Yuan. Economic control supervisors were set up in the three cities of Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. Yu Hongjun and Jiang Jingguo were appointed as the two supervisors in this city. They have convened several meetings in recent days. It is reported that the important decisions include prohibiting the movement of materials, prohibiting the southward transportation of cloth, implementing a license system, and temporarily suspending the export of edible oils such as vegetable oil, bean oil, peanut oil, and sesame oil and their raw materials for three months. Jiang has also repeatedly made speeches, emphasizing the implementation of comprehensive economic control, that everyone is equal before the law, and that no matter how rich or powerful they are, they will not be tolerated if they violate the law, and that economic enemies will be thoroughly eliminated.

According to reports, the price response in various places before and after the implementation of the new currency system showed a tendency to rise in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, a tendency to fall in Beiping, Tianjin, and North China, and a relatively stable situation in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Central China.

The price trend in this city last week showed a decline on Monday and a gradual rebound after Tuesday, mostly hovering within the August 19th price limits. However, the cloth market saw few transactions, and the selling price stood firm at the increased price. The market situation was only seen in the association's quotations. It is reported that the authorities are planning to investigate the situation.

In terms of food, rice prices were stable, and due to the large number of arrivals and sluggish sales, market prices hovered below the August 19th price limits. For example, the price of superior white japonica rice dropped from more than 20 yuan at the beginning of the week to about 19 yuan and 2 jiao at the weekend. The price of oil and flour, on the other hand, rose slowly from the low price at the beginning of the week, approaching the increase limit.

Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cigarettes also rose from the low price at the beginning of the week to the edge of the August 19th price limit. Guben soap was 8,050,000 legal currency on August 19th, and it was priced at 27 gold yuan on Thursday. Beautiful matches were 37,000,000 legal currency on August 19th, and they were priced at 115 yuan on Thursday. Small Great Britain 500 cigarettes were 10,300,000 legal currency on August 19th, and they were priced at 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen on Thursday. The prices of other commodities also mostly rebounded from the low prices at the beginning of the week and stood at the original prices of the August 19th price limits.

### Currency and Finance

(1) Tight Money Market

Last Monday was the first day of market resumption after the currency reform. Various sectors were mostly observing the effects of the new economic plan. Banking firms stopped interbank lending and urged the repayment of old debts. Off-market funds hesitated to move forward, creating a situation where there were goods but no way to sell them. As a result, those seeking funds were eager, but the supply was scarce. Monday's money market was unprecedentedly tight, with the informal interest rate soaring to nine jiao. Discount rates on currency, even for overnight loans, often reached as high as 25 to 30 yuan. However, this situation was fleeting. After Tuesday, the money market eased, and by Thursday, idle funds were flooding in like a torrent! The reasons were nothing more than: (1) Huge government expenditures, leading to massive net outflows from banks for several consecutive days. (2) As a result of the Central Bank and its entrusted banks redeeming gold, silver, and foreign currencies, from Monday to Thursday, a total of 34,454,283.944 gold yuan were exchanged. If calculated in terms of legal tender (fabi), the idle funds in the market would have increased by over a hundred trillion. (3) Under the strong control of the authorities, buyers were watching and waiting, and demand for funds was scarce, leading to a trend of ample supply but little demand. (4) Foreign banks, due to acting as agents for foreign currency exchange and issuing bank drafts, also experienced significant net outflows, which had a considerable impact on the money market.

One inevitable result of the abundant money supply was the frequent decline in informal interest rates. On Monday, overnight interest rates soared to nine jiao, but on Tuesday, they generally fell below eight jiao. On Wednesday, they even dropped to as low as three jiao, and on Thursday, they plummeted further, with some firms lending out funds at the cost of two or three yuan per day. Market interest rates were roughly on par with official lending rates. This trend was truly rare. Such an abundance of idle funds might be a hidden worry for the future of prices. Discount rates on currency also decreased daily last week. On Monday, they were between 25 and 30 yuan per day, but on Tuesday, they fell to around 20 yuan, and on Wednesday, they shrank to around 10 yuan.

The net outflow of national banks from Monday to Thursday totaled 5,065,903 gold yuan, equivalent to more than 150 trillion legal tender.

Foreign banks also had a net outflow of 760,105 gold yuan from Monday to Thursday, equivalent to more than 20 trillion legal tender. The net outflow of foreign banks was a rare occurrence in the past three months.

Commercial banks and firms suffered from having ample funds that they could not lend out. Interbank lending was virtually nonexistent. The net inflow of banks after the 60th number from Monday to Thursday totaled 85,174 gold yuan. However, after deducting the net outflow of the Bank of Taiwan during the same period, the indirect exchange group actually had a net inflow of approximately 430,000 gold yuan.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

Last week, the foreign exchange market saw the Hong Kong telegraphic transfer rate on Monday at 4.7 jiao per 10,000 legal tender. The price of gold in Hong Kong was HK$332.05 per tael on Monday, falling to HK$320 on Wednesday. The market price of the US dollar in Hong Kong also saw a decrease, with Monday at HK$5.4, Tuesday at HK$5.3, and Wednesday at HK$5.27.

The listed price for gold ornaments in the local market was 200 gold yuan per tael plus a 10 yuan handling fee for selling, and 190 gold yuan for buying. Exchange certificates also saw some activity after the authorities indicated they would temporarily cease purchasing them, with prices on Tuesday at 3.3 to 3.5 yuan, and on Thursday slightly rising to 3.45 to 3.55 yuan.

Last week, domestic interbank exchange rates generally declined. The Shanghai exchange rate was 200 yuan on Monday, sharply falling by 70 yuan on Tuesday, and further decreasing to 50 yuan after Wednesday.

The Xiamen exchange rate was 150 yuan on Monday, falling to 50 yuan from Tuesday to Thursday. The Chongqing exchange rate was initially 150 yuan, falling to 100 yuan on Tuesday, but rebounding from Wednesday, returning to 150 yuan on Thursday.

The Hankou exchange rate fell from 150 yuan on Monday to 30 yuan on Wednesday, but rebounded to 80 yuan on Thursday. The rise and fall of exchange rates in Chongqing and Hankou was said to be due to the outflow of funds from Shanghai to those areas for purchasing goods.

The Tianjin exchange rate followed a similar trend, with the exchange rate at 25 yuan on Monday, falling to 5 yuan on Tuesday, but rebounding to 20 yuan on Wednesday, and further rising to a high of 60 yuan on Friday.

### Export Promotion Administration Announces Minimum Export Prices, Generally in US Dollars

The Export Promotion Administration of the Export Control Board announced a batch of minimum prices for major export commodities on the 23rd of this month, for exporters to refer to when quoting prices in order to maintain the market price of Chinese goods overseas.

It is also learned that the administration has newly announced export price limits for: (1) Cottonseed Oil (bulk, per long ton): US$415; Cottonseed Cake (per long ton): US$60; (2) Tea (all in US dollars per pound): New Qihong: $0.20; Old Qihong: $0.15; New Tunxi Zhenmei (1): $0.30; New Tunxi Zhenmei (2): $0.25; Old Tunxi Zhenmei (1): $0.20; Old Tunxi Zhenmei (2): $0.14; New Tunxi Zhenmei Needles: $0.18; Old Tunxi Zhenmei Needles: $0.11; New Pingshui Tea: $0.22. (3) Casings (all in US dollars per piece): Coarse casings, 13.5 yards: $0.15; Ordinary patterns: $0.

### Hong Kong Remittances to be Regulated, Measures to be Implemented Soon

Yu Yingjie, the Central Bank's representative in Hong Kong, recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. He has reported to the bank's top authorities on the situation in Hong Kong after the implementation of the new economic plan. Another major task of Yu's trip was how to attract overseas remittances. According to Yu, the implementation of the new economic plan is conducive to attracting overseas remittances. Overseas remittances are bound to increase because foreign exchange rates have become more balanced, and there is no black market difference. Overseas remittances should come in steadily. The Central Bank has drafted measures to regulate overseas remittances after considering the actual situation in Hong Kong. August and September are peak months for overseas remittances, and the implementation of these measures cannot be delayed and will be announced soon. As most overseas remittances are remitted through private remittance agencies, the Central Bank will convert them at the current exchange rate in Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other places.

### Manufacturers Have Not Yet Signed Contracts for Allocated Japanese Reparations Materials Due to High US Dollar Exchange Rate

According to Ouyang Lun, Director of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, most manufacturers who applied for the recently allocated Japanese reparations materials have not signed contracts. The reason is that these Japanese reparations machines must be paid for at the US dollar exchange rate. However, since the implementation of this currency reform, the set exchange rate of one US dollar has exceeded the transaction price of exchange certificates on the 19th. As a result, most manufacturers feel that the allocated price is too high and are unwilling to accept it.

### More Woolen Fabrics Being Sold Than Bought

Recently, the market for woolen fabrics has remained sluggish, with standard prices mostly lower than the selling prices on the 19th, and there is a general situation of more selling than buying. Recently, the number of woolen fabric cuttings and women's overcoat orders has decreased significantly, and the demand from buyers in various regions is low. At the same time, firms are experiencing tight money conditions, and the discount rate for gold yuan notes remains high at 1.5 to 2 jiao.

### Commercial Briefs

The deadline for the sale of hides and furs is approaching, but sales are sluggish. Exports of some hides and furs are also minimal due to lack of activity abroad, and prices are generally stagnant due to industry players adhering to price limits.

Kiln goods have been steadily declining, and the market is depressed. Large-sized blue bricks have fallen by 3 yuan, small-sized blue bricks have plummeted by 13 yuan, small tiles have also decreased by 9.3 yuan, and Du Hong tiles are offered at 0.126 yuan, small ones at 0.073 yuan.

Wool transactions are sluggish, with both buyers and sellers taking a wait-and-see approach. Shandong wool and Huzhou general goods, washed wool, etc., remain stagnant at prices before August 19.

The electrical materials market has seen a decrease in actual sales, while retail and some wholesale goods still maintain the original prices before August 19. However, the rise and fall of some goods will depend on the factory prices and how sales progress.

Western cotton bottoms have been out of stock for a long time. News from the new goods producing areas indicates that the cost of soil extraction is quite high, and production has decreased compared to previous years, as most rural laborers have fled and not returned, resulting in goods being abandoned in the fields (the producing area of Western cotton is the Shanxi region). The market outlook is firm.

### Municipal Education Bureau Plans Five-Year School Construction Plan to Promote National Education

[Our Newspaper] In order to promote national education, the Municipal Education Bureau has recently drafted a five-year school construction plan for promoting national education in the city. The content generally states that 25% of school-age children in the city are not yet enrolled. Considering local financial resources and the importance of national education, the plan aims to gradually increase the number of schools in different districts from January 1948 to December 1952, increasing the number of schools from 277 to 377. The principles for establishing schools are: (1) In the urban areas of the city (Districts 1 to 20), where the population is dense and there are many private primary schools, the principle is to establish one municipal national school for every five security units (bao), or one school for every 2,000 school-age children. Adjustments may be made based on the economic situation of the people. (2) In the rural areas of the city (Districts 21 to 32), where the population density is lower and there are fewer private primary schools, the principle is to establish one municipal national school for every security unit; the number of schools may be reduced in districts with fewer school-age children. According to statistics, there are already 83 schools in the urban areas, and it is planned to add 71 schools to reach a standard of 162 schools. There are already 194 schools in the rural areas, and it is planned to add 32 schools to reach a standard of 215 schools. This year, it is planned to add 12 schools in the urban areas and 5 schools in the rural areas. Next year, it is planned to add 20 schools in the urban areas and 8 schools in the rural areas. In 1950, it is planned to add 18 schools in the urban areas and 8 schools in the rural areas. In 1951, it is planned to add 8 schools in the urban areas and 6 schools in the rural areas. In 1952, it is planned to add 13 schools in the urban areas and 5 schools in the rural areas, with the goal of reaching a total of 377 schools in the city.

### The 1359 Character Searching Method

— Xu Qinwen

It seems that when urging children to study on their own, answering questions about new words is a time-consuming task. What's undesirable is that many new words aren't brought up at the same time; suddenly, "Dad! What's this word?" And then, "Dad! What does this word mean?" This time, as soon as summer vacation started, I bought each of my two children a dictionary, thinking that if I let them look it up themselves, I could have some peace and quiet. But the result was even more troublesome, because many words couldn't be found. For these kinds of new words, they not only asked how to look them up, but also why they had to look them up that way. It's not that there's no reason to explain, but for middle school and elementary school students who haven't understood the "Six Scripts" and haven't studied Explaining Characters and Analyzing Words, some words are always difficult to understand right away. Actually, even high school students have this problem. Not long ago, a girl in the second semester of her sophomore year in high school spent a lot of time still unable to find the "爾" character in her own name. Even for myself, there are some unfamiliar words that I have to look up in the character search table first. Although the Commercial Press's National Phonetic Student Dictionary can look up characters by pronunciation in the National Phonetic Character Search Table at the back, you have to be familiar with the National Phonetic Alphabet, which is not convenient for the average elementary and middle school students in Jiangnan today. But for English, after the older child bought a dictionary, he just looked it up himself when he encountered new words, and never came to ask me again. It's not because the English teachers are particularly good at teaching, or because the Chinese teachers and I, as a family member who is also a Chinese teacher, are not good at teaching. It's really because English dictionaries are arranged according to the alphabet, which is orderly and organized; Chinese dictionaries, using the radical method as a standard, are inevitably fragmented. There are only 26 letters in the English alphabet, but there are as many as 240 radicals, and the difference between simple and complex is also very large. Our Chinese characters are so complex and difficult! Language is a tool for seeking knowledge; the longer the time spent studying language, the less time there is for seeking knowledge. The underdevelopment of science in our country is largely due to the difficulty of the language. This is a very serious problem. To make the country rich and strong, science must be developed first. To develop science, the language must be reformed. The fundamental reform of language is related to political ideology, which cannot be discussed here. What should be noted is how to simplify it so that beginners can study it and those who aspire to learn but are forced by circumstances to not enter school can also study on their own at any time. Zhu Yongyi Guangsheng from Jinhua, after years of careful research, invented the 1359 character searching method, which compares the strokes of Chinese characters to the letters of Western languages, and the order of strokes of Chinese characters to the order of letters in Western languages. The so-called 1359, 1 is 一 (horizontal), 3 is 丨 (vertical with three strokes), 5 is 丿 (the character 五 has a left-falling stroke), 9 is 丶 (a dot is the end of a stroke, 9 is the end of a number). The remaining 24678, 2 is a double horizontal stroke, such as 　　, etc.; 4 is a double vertical stroke, such as 亅; 6 is a double left-falling stroke, such as 　　　; 7 is a curved stroke, such as 乚, etc.; 8 is a right-falling stroke, such as 乀. The method is simple, and the search is easy. Middle-grade elementary school students can learn it within half an hour. The Ministry of Education's review opinion says that the memorization is not difficult, and there are no complicated rules for usage. The review opinion from the Academia Sinica has this paragraph: "In recent years, people in our country have been troubled by the difficulty of radical character searching and have sought to find other ways to simplify it. The most notable are Wang Yunwu's Four-Corner Code Character Searching Method and Chen Lifu's Five-Stroke Character Searching Method. However, Wang's method of analyzing characters must take four corners, which loses its naturalness. The four corner strokes are not always present, and it is inevitable that they are forced. Therefore, the examples cannot be precise and there are many exceptions. Although it has been widely promoted with the help of publishing, it has been criticized and will eventually decline. Chen's method starts with the distinction of strokes, taking the five types of first strokes and the five types of second strokes as the framework, and placing Chinese characters into 55 categories, allowing people to find them according to the order of dots, horizontals, verticals, diagonals, and curves, which is a more natural approach and the rules are even simpler. Applying it to the organization of official documents has been quite effective. However, at the beginning of its creation, the analysis was not completely thorough, and there are still many cases of indistinguishable similarities. It goes without saying that it needs to be improved. Now, according to Zhu Yongyi's 1359 character searching method, it also starts with the analysis of strokes. After studying more than 8,000 characters, he obtained more than 30 types of strokes in the current script. He regarded their shapes and classified them into nine categories, each of which is associated with Arabic numerals. All characters can be regarded as their stroke types and numbered according to the stroke order. By following the numbers, they can be found in an instant. Its intention is almost the same as the Five-Stroke Character Searching Method, but the rules are very different. Comparing the two methods, it is clear that Zhu's method is more precise, detailed, and accurate than Chen's."

Mr. Zhu brought his newly compiled dictionary to me. After less than ten minutes of explanation, he made me understand his 1359 character searching method; and he quickly gave examples and performed the character search for me to see. His sincere attitude made me secretly admire him as soon as I met him. I learned that he was a mechanical engineer, who worked at the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in 1921 and 1922 and also taught courses at the Mechanical Staff Training Class; the invention of the 1359 character searching method was originally for the convenience of teaching. This character searching method can also be applied to telegrams, directly sending and receiving numbers without going through the translation process. This is very useful for transportation, technology, and universal education, and contributes a lot to the country and the nation, so I admire him even more. The review opinion from the Academia Sinica also said, "Overall, Zhu's book can be said to be precise and detailed, just as the Ministry of Education's review opinion said. The suspect character index has only 58 characters, and there are only 25 characters with the same strokes that need to be further identified, so the current character searching methods cannot surpass it."

Since it is the best character searching method now, we must quickly find a way to print it so as to help beginners in general, make it easier for them to study on their own, and also relieve me of the difficulties I have with my children.

### Remembering Yuan Hanyun

— Qian Dacheng

Reading Chen Zuogao's article "Two or Three Things About Yuan Hanyun," I was moved and also recorded one or two anecdotes about Hanyun to enrich Free Talk.

Hanyun liked to collect books, but he was just a so-called bibliophile! He had no insight into the study of versions and catalogs. Mao Zijin's book carving was criticized at the time as merely a heroic act, and Hanyun was not even comparable to Zijin. It is said that the "Baoging Lou" library of Fu Qingai in Ningxian County was sold off in the summer of 1916. Shanghai booksellers pooled 47,000 yuan and carried the books away in bundles. At first, they thought it was a rare commodity and wanted to sell it to Hanyun, asking for 180,000 yuan. However, after Xiangcheng died, they reduced the price to one-third, and it could be sold for 60,000 or 70,000 yuan, which was a burden that could not be borne without profit. In the end, Liu Hanyi bought some of them. Ye Changchi's "Diary of Yuandulu" recorded the matter in detail, calling Hanyun "Cao Zijian," which was not without criticism. But Hanyun also compared himself to Zijian. It is said that Hanyun and his brother Keding quarreled, and Hanyun called Keding Cao Pi. Xiangcheng heard this, smiled and said angrily, "Who do you think I am?"

Hanyun and the talented Longyang Yi Shifu were quite close. Shifu wrote "Hanyun's Teahouse Anecdotes," which was extremely flattering. When Xiangcheng usurped the throne and proclaimed himself emperor, he gave Shifu the position of Counselor of the Seal Casting Bureau, a position two levels below the director. Shifu was overjoyed and wrote a poem expressing his happiness. When the imperial system collapsed, Shifu died in despair.

### Various Malpractices in the Qing Dynasty Examination Halls

— Yiyun

This column recently published an article on "Cheating on Exams," which described the various malpractices in recent school exams as vividly as possible. It happened that Mr. Zhang, a Qing Dynasty Xiucai, was present and, after reading the article, recounted the situation of cheating in the Qing Dynasty examination halls, which is recorded as follows:

(1) Prefectural Examination: This is the examination by the Academic Intendant to select Xiucai. Cheating involved hiring substitutes, also known as "gun supervisors," because they wrote essays or took exams for others in the examination hall. On a larger scale, there were often multiple substitutes and multiple buyers. Although everyone was seated according to their numbers after entering the hall, because there were many people, the essays written by the substitutes were passed around to each other, or crumpled into paper balls and thrown to the buyers, which was more convenient. In some cases, the staff inside the hall and the dabans (the name of the bailiffs in the hall) were bribed to pass the messages around. If there was only one substitute and the buyer's seat was far away, they could only wait for an opportunity to throw the paper ball from afar. Some people could write essays for several people and still pass, which showed that their writing was quick-witted and exceptional. Generally speaking, the atmosphere among the scholars at that time was relatively honest, and as long as they avoided the officials' eyes, the other scholars in the hall would not bother to report them even if they saw it. Occasionally, there were those who did not accept bribes. If they happened to see a paper ball thrown near them, they would snatch it first, preventing the buyer from getting it. Those who snatched the paper would actually pass the exam because of it. As for taking the exam for others, since there were no photos at that time, it was easy to deceive. However, the guaranty process had to be worked out. Before entering the hall, there had to be a student as a guarantor (all Xiucai who passed the first class could be appointed as guarantor when there was a vacancy). The guarantor was a local person who was familiar with everything, so it was not easy to deceive him. Moreover, he was responsible for the guaranty, which could not be accomplished without bribing him with money. However, the scholars at that time still feared the law, and the crime of taking the exam for someone else was more serious, so few guarantors dared to provide guarantees.

(2) Provincial Examination: The provincial examination was the exam for Juren. Cheating involved hiring substitutes, buying recommendation scrolls, etc. Substitutes were as described above. The provincial examination hall was very large, and each person had a separate room. The time also lasted for several days and nights. Although communication was cut off after the questions were released, it was difficult to completely prevent the transmission of substitutes. If they happened to be in neighboring rooms, they could do whatever they wanted, and the inspectors could not reach them. Buying recommendation scrolls involved cheating with the officials who graded the papers. Beforehand, the connections of the grading officials were bought. The connections were no more than a few numbers. The buyer would embed these numbers into the first few sentences of the essay they wrote. When the official saw it, they would submit the paper so that the chief examiner could select it. However, it depended on how the papers were divided. If the paper was assigned to another official's room, it would be ineffective. Also, the chief and deputy examiners could not be free from malpractice. They mostly did it for the sons or relatives of powerful officials in the capital, which was not easy for ordinary people to accomplish.

(3) Palace Examination: The palace examination was the test for new Jinshi in the palace hall. The top three scholars and the Hanlin scholars all came from this exam. The most important thing was calligraphy, which had to be respectful in every character and completely conform to the model. It also had to be written quickly. Only by writing enough eight pages (in the past, two sides were considered one page, one page being one side) was there hope of becoming one of the top three. Usually, the paper of the top scholar was recommended by the reviewing minister with the highest rank. Even if those with lower ranks obtained excellent papers, they could not select the top scholar unless they negotiated with the highest minister for a concession. Over time, this became an open malpractice. Also, the ministers all brought their own pens and ink in case there were minor flaws in the excellent papers, so they could wipe them out and correct them on behalf of the candidate. It is said that the calligraphy of a certain top scholar was extremely good, but he wrote relatively slowly. When he was about to finish writing eight pages, it was already dark. According to regulations, candles could not be lit. A certain minister, pitying his talent, ordered someone to burn scraps of paper next to him to illuminate the paper so that he could finish writing. Although these two things were both done out of love for talent, strictly speaking, they were also malpractices.

(4) The IOU for Buying a Substitute: Although the substitute was skilled in writing, he could not guarantee that the examiner would accept him. Therefore, the buyer had to pay the money after passing the exam. However, the substitute was also worried that he would not be paid after passing the exam, so he had to give an IOU first as proof. The wording of the IOU was extremely clever, generally saying that because he needed money after passing the exam, he borrowed a certain amount from so-and-so (the name of the substitute), stating that it would be repaid in full at a certain time, etc. This did not leave any traces of illegal buying of a substitute, and it was clearly written that it was a loan after passing the exam, so if he did not pass the exam, the substitute could not use the IOU to demand payment.

In short, after the imperial examination was held for a long time, there were naturally more malpractices. The above is just a glimpse of them.

### Love

— Jinlin

When loving people are separated, that love is like water placed over a fire: for a little while, it makes it boil; too long, and it will run dry. —— Earl

Love is our life - we live by love, love gives us vitality. —— Cornell

Love is not lost. Even if love is given to others and there is no return, it will flow back like a heat wave, warming your heart and making it pure. —— Owen

### A History of Oral Hygiene

— Mao Yi

Like perfume, rouge, and brassieres, oral hygiene products such as tooth powder and toothpicks can be traced back to ancient times. Two thousand years ago, a Greek doctor would write a recipe for toothpaste in verse. In the early days of the United States, people did not yet know how to use toothbrushes. George Washington's dentist advised him to rub his teeth with a cloth dipped in chalk. Decades later, toothbrushes were introduced to the United States, but oral hygiene products remained a luxury and were not popularized.

In 1859, a New York wholesale merchant named William Henry Hall pioneered a red mouthwash called "Sozodont"—a combination of the Greek words for "preserve" and "teeth." "Sozodont" contained 37% alcohol, which was harmful rather than beneficial to teeth. However, when Hall died in 1894, he had already earned ten million U.S. dollars. Although "Sozodont" was detrimental to dental health and fell out of favor with the rise of tooth powder and toothpaste, at least its extensive advertising taught Americans to brush their teeth.

The first American to manufacture tooth powder was dentist Israel Washburn Lyon, whose first product was called "Lyon's Dental Tablets." These "tablets" were made by pressing tooth powder into a thin, biscuit-shaped form and dividing it into many connected small pieces, like a bar of chocolate. When used, a small piece would be broken off and placed on the toothbrush. In 1874, Lyon also manufactured bottled tooth powder, which was later changed to canned form, outselling the "tablets."

Toothpaste was sold in the United States before the Civil War, some imported and some made by dentists for their patients. The toothpaste was originally packaged in small bottles, and the toothbrush had to be dipped into the bottle to use it. This made people feel unsanitary and reluctant to use it.

The squeezable tube was originally invented by American John Rand in 1841 to hold paint colors. In 1892, the Sheffield family, father and son dentists from New London County, Connecticut, began experimenting with using this type of tube to hold toothpaste. Once introduced to the market, it spread like wildfire. Thus, tube toothpaste laid the foundation for today.

The ingredients of various brands of oral hygiene products are actually quite similar. The main ingredients of various tooth powders and toothpastes are nothing more than abrasives that whiten teeth, foaming agents, and fragrances. Some dentists say that salt and alkali are as effective as tooth powder and toothpaste in cleaning teeth.

The American toothpaste industry has extremely high profits. For a tube of toothpaste that retails for 41 cents, the manufacturer can earn 15 cents, the retailer earns 14 cents, the cost of raw materials and the tube each accounts for only 4 cents, and the remaining 8 cents is purely for advertising expenses—last year alone, American oral hygiene product manufacturers spent as much as sixteen million dollars on advertising. And the money Americans spend on oral hygiene products is also astonishing—eighty million dollars a year.

### Inscription on the Handwriting of Shen Yunying

— Shi Shufan

The military's heart turned to the enemy, the people's hearts grew cold, overnight thousands upon hundreds of villages were lost. Hunger and cold forced a torrent of destruction, the general guarding the city and the chief officials were silent. What of the Daizhou garrison commander? He spurred on his ailing horse, ascending steep peaks. Outside Matan Post, the setting sun slanted, ten thousand ants swarmed, his lone sword casting a shadow. He bravely beheaded five officers, but perished himself, the chaotic crows spitting out a heaven-filling rage. A daughter, a daughter burst forth from the tent, flying onto the carved saddle, her face powder unwashed: "Father served the country, I will protect the city, who will follow me, raise your spears!" Red silk thread stitching the character 'Shi' on a Shen-family spear, a hemp hat slanting east, her moth eyebrows tightened. Her resounding, fragrant heroism transformed into wind and thunder, dispersing stubborn mist and demonic comets in an instant. She raised the flag and seized her father's corpse, the bandits watched from the fortified pass, not daring to approach. Alas, for two decades the market was engulfed in the smoke of war, the Xiangyuan plain was able to achieve peace for farming and sericulture. Jingzhou then fell, her husband died, grief overwhelmed the orphaned widow, she took everything upon herself. While grieving for the people, she also cherished private kindness, how could she bear to leave the white bones in the wilderness? A soft heart and a firm will, in constant cycles, it is pitiful how fate thwarted her so! Abandoning officialdom and hanging up her sash was not her wish, she repeatedly pleaded with the people, and only then did they agree. Two coffins descended east, the great river was cold, fallen leaves were silent, cinnabar cords led the way. From then on, she feared hearing the cries of night crows, in this life she would never see paired mandarin ducks again. Having experienced national upheaval, her thoughts turned to withered ashes, blue sky and yellow earth, she was a broken stalk entrusted to the earth. In a long lane, teaching students, life was simple, she ate coarse rice and vegetables when hungry, and drank from a gourd when thirsty. Her young nephew Xian was diligent in asking about writing, able to understand the rise and fall of dynasties, truly an unusual gift. She carefully stored the old Lin Youjun calligraphy, and handed it to you, crushed into powder. Lady Gu once served in the official's study, in the Qing Dynasty, paintings always showed worthy men enjoying tea beneath the flowers. Sometimes she would dance with swords, imitating Gongsun, sometimes she would dip her brush and lightly criticize divine works. She would have taken action to reverse the universe, who knew that the dream would be short, a Yellow Millet dream awakened! Gao Zhang Sujun wrote small poems to encourage her, unable to distinguish between tears and ink marks. East of Xiaoshan City, beneath Yin Mountain, a seven-foot broken stele, pine and cypress hidden, the grave trampled by cattle and sheep, the grass perhaps withered, her soul protects the frost-covered zither, never extinguished. Ding Sheng obtained it from the painter Jiang, it flowed from Suzhou into the Yuanjiang boat, passing through many hands, it eventually returned to Liang Huorong, originating from divine endowment, certainly not by chance. Yesterday, I unrolled the painting, the four walls glowed, the autumn lamp connected to the Milky Way. Water, vermilion, mud seal, dark silk grid, the illustrious Shen family of Yunying. Alas, I bow and offer incense again, my eyes are filled with sorrow, my mind dizzy, sitting and thinking of today's city defenders, I deeply mourn the hungry husbands on the boats. Eight lines posted before the gates of the nation, may they be a mirror for those heroic women, stirring them to awaken!

Editor's Note: Ms. Shen's posthumous work has been reproduced and published in yesterday's issue of this newspaper. Mr. Shi has written in detail about its origins. Please refer to that article.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation Triangle Love Two Women Willing to Share One Husband

Gu Long asked a friend, Mr. Jia, who married Ms. Yi ten years ago. The couple lived harmoniously, but two years after their marriage, Jia became infatuated with Ms. Bing, a neighbor. Ms. Bing is determined to marry Jia, and recently plans to move in with him. He has several questions and asks for your answers: (1) Without the consent of Ms. Bing's parents, can Jia live with Bing? (2) If Ms. Yi does not object to Jia and Bing living together, does that constitute consent? (3) Is it a crime for Jia to live with Bing without marrying her? (4) If Bing attempts suicide, is Jia guilty of a crime? (5) Without holding a wedding ceremony, can a lawyer's notarization establish a marital relationship?

[Mr. Tang Wushi's Answer] (1) Adults have autonomy in marriage and do not need the consent of their parents. (2) Hindering a family and marriage, in law, requires a complaint to be filed, and it stipulates that a spouse who condones or forgives the offense cannot bring charges; however, a married person committing adultery with another person is itself a criminal act (Article 239 of the Criminal Code). If they cohabit, it is a continuous state, and the statute of limitations for filing a complaint must be calculated from the date the act ends (see Article 80 of the Criminal Code). One must not act impulsively and test the law! (3) If Jia can wield the hot sword, both he and others will benefit. Bing is an adult and should not bear criminal responsibility. (4) If Bing has rationality, she should know when to advance and when to retreat; stealing another's love is unreasonable, and willingly stepping into the legal net is unwise.
