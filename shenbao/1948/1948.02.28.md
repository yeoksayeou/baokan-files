### North Korea Assists Communist Rebellion; Military Conference Jointly Held in Pyongyang; 30,000 Korean Troops Sent to Northeast to Join War

[Associated Press, this city dispatch] High-level intelligence sources stated on the 27th that Soviet-controlled North Korea has jointly formed a military conference with the Chinese Communists. The source revealed the contents of a certain report, stating: The location of the military conference is in Pyongyang, North Korea. Due to its activities, "Soviet assistance to the Communist armies in the Northeast provinces has been definitely confirmed. The joint military conference is more active than all communist liaison organizations, responsible for coordinating the activities of three major command headquarters, including troop movements and maintenance of logistics." The report further stated: The weapons and ammunition of the Japanese army stationed in Korea at the time of victory have been transferred to the Chinese Communists. "An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Korean troops have been sent to the nine eastern provinces, assisting the Chinese Communists through the power of the joint military conference headquarters in Pyongyang." It is learned that wounded communist troops "have been transferred to North Korea for treatment." The Chinese Communists "trade rubber shoes for food from the Northeast." "When the North Korean People's Army was formed, the Soviet Red Army armed it with Japanese equipment captured at the end of the war. Last summer, all the Japanese equipment suddenly disappeared, and the People's Army switched to Soviet weapons, and its uniforms were similar to those of the Red Army. The Japanese equipment then fell into the hands of the Chinese Communists." The report estimates that the number of Japanese who surrendered to the American army was around 179,000, and the number who surrendered to the Soviet army was even higher. "Therefore, the joint military conference has sufficient resources and can equip at least 15 divisions of the Chinese Communist army with the Japanese weapons captured in North Korea." It is said that the Koreans sent to China "are deployed between Jilin and the Korean border, under the command of the Chinese Communists, mostly serving in transportation and service roles." The report also stated: Generally, it is not believed that the Korean army "has participated in actual combat. The reason why they appear in the Northeast is generally believed to be to train the Chinese Communist army in combat and to protect both sides of the Chinese Communist Northeast front." According to related reports, the National Army has encountered the Korean army on the battlefield. The report believes: "That batch of Korean troops may have been living with the Eighth Route Army for a long time, but they are not among the 30,000 sent to the Northeast by the joint military conference in May last year."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The increased expenses for local self-defense forces were discussed at the State Council meeting on the 27th, and it was resolved that all expenses would be allocated by the central government and would not be raised by the local governments. It has been learned that the central government's method of increasing the source of funds mainly lies in increasing taxes and increasing revenue from domestic tobacco and alcohol taxes to fill it, and amending Article 2 of the draft regulations on domestic tobacco and alcohol taxes to implement it first. At the same time, please set the tax rates for tobacco and alcohol taxes as follows: A. Tobacco taxes are divided into two types: tobacco leaves and tobacco shreds. Tobacco counties assess and determine the duty-paid price according to the production area and collect 60%, and tobacco shreds are 70%. B. Alcohol taxes are collected at 100% of the assessed tax price according to the production area. The total amount of increased taxes for items A and B is estimated to be around 400 billion yuan in five months. C. For the salt tax portion, industrial salt is not taxed, salt for fishery use is increased by 50,000 yuan per dan, and the national table salt is uniformly increased by 70,000 yuan per dan starting from February. It is estimated that it can increase revenue by 1.5 trillion yuan in five months. In addition, out of the relief expenditure in the national general budget for the first half of the year, 2 trillion yuan will be allocated for suppressing rebellion and restoring order, and it is planned to spend 1.7 trillion yuan. Combining the above three totals 3.6 trillion, which is enough to pay for the expenses of the self-defense forces.

### Taft and Bridges Advocate Special Appropriations for Military Aid to China; Allocation of Over 270 Million at Once

This amount is equal to the amount that Secretary of State Marshall requested in a letter to the speakers of the House and Senate yesterday to continue aid to Greece and Turkey. According to the two senators, they will try to allocate funds to supply arms to the Chinese government to combat the Communist Party when the Senate discusses the new bill to aid Greece and Turkey. Taft is currently the chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, and Bridges is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and is of great importance to government expenditure issues.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] According to Senator Vandenberg, Marshall reiterated his proposal for a limited economic plan under the $570 million aid to China plan during a secret meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for more than two hours today.

### US Revises Far East Policy; Sends Strategist Kennan to Japan for Investigation; Will Also Study Situation in Northern China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] The United States is currently re-examining its Far East policy and has dispatched George Kennan, Chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, to Japan to undertake special duties studying the situation in that region. Secretary of State Marshall announced today that Kennan has departed for Japan to investigate the situation in Japan and to confer with General MacArthur. Although Secretary Marshall did not reveal the specifics of Kennan's itinerary, US officials told a Central News Agency reporter that the Chairman of the State Department Policy Planning Staff (referring to Kennan) will also study the situation in North China and the communist issues in Korea during this trip to the Far East. However, Secretary Marshall only acknowledged that Kennan's mission is related to the future peace treaty with Japan, and said he does not know whether Kennan will visit China or how long he will stay in Japan. Kennan plans to return home via the Philippines. When asked if Kennan's mission is related to the recently announced US policy of assisting Japan's economic recovery to a self-sufficient basis, Secretary Marshall replied that Kennan will study this particular issue during his stay in Japan.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th, United Press] Senior US officials told United Press reporters that Secretary Marshall's action in sending Kennan, a senior advisor on foreign policy, to Japan, is a prelude to the United States' intention to drastically change its policy towards Japan and to strive to build Japan into a fortress to prevent Soviet expansion in the Far East. It is said that the United States has decided to abandon its position of punishing Japan, as advocated in the Potsdam Conference, and is now striving to restore Japan's economic prosperity so that it can become a fortress in Asia to resist communism. General MacArthur has long held this view. It is said that, in addition to this fundamental reason, it is hoped that Kennan's trip will also quell some people's comments on the US government's neglect of the Far East due to its concern for the European situation. The decision to send Kennan to Japan was reached at a policy meeting last week.

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] United Press learned on the 27th from authoritative sources that China's general attitude towards Japan, especially on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, has undergone a drastic change, and is almost completely aligned with US policy. According to the position announced by the Chinese government in April last year, it was the same as the Soviet Union's attitude. At that time, the government declared that if the Soviet Union did not attend the peace conference, China would not participate either. The current new attitude of China is in sharp contrast to the previous position. The person who instigated this change is Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, who is "slow and steady," and the reason for this shift is that the threat of communism to China and the world is increasing.

Editorial

### Starting from the Czech Coup

After several days of brewing, the Czech political upheaval has resulted in President Beneš, who believed in liberal democracy and followed a center-left path, finally succumbing to external pressure and internal threats. He accepted the resignations of the People's Social Party, the People's Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party cabinet members, and approved the list of communist cabinet members proposed by Prime Minister Gottwald. Although the new cabinet still maintains the appearance of a "coalition government," the power is completely in the hands of the Czech Communist Party, and the new cabinet has already announced that a rectification movement will be implemented in every public institution throughout the country to eliminate those who oppose the government. Therefore, this cabinet reshuffle in Czechoslovakia is not only a change in Czechoslovakia's internal affairs, but its impact is enough to affect the overall world situation. Its significance is really not to be ignored.

The Soviet Union is overjoyed at the Czech Communist Party's seizure of power, which goes without saying. As Kaufman, an English commentator for Moscow Radio, said: "The Czech people have shown a high degree of political activity, and the reactionaries obviously did not expect the unity of the masses to be so strong." This statement can represent the Soviet side's view. But on the other hand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France issued a joint declaration condemning the Czech communists' seizure of power, stating that "establishing a one-party dictatorship under the guise of a coalition government can only lead to great disasters for the Czech people," and that this political upheaval "endangers the existence of the principles of freedom cherished by all democratic countries." The United States may go further and take economic sanctions against the Czech communist regime. According to senior US officials, four measures may be taken: (1) the US Export-Import Bank will cancel the plan to grant Czechoslovakia a $20 million cotton loan; (2) the Treasury Department will freeze all Czech government assets in the United States; (3) the US representative to the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development will oppose Czechoslovakia's proposed reconstruction loan; and (4) the US representative to the International Monetary Fund will oppose Czechoslovakia's loan application. From this, it can be seen that although the Czech political upheaval has now come to an end, its consequences are enough to cause a great international political storm.

Czechoslovakia, as a country, emerged after the First World War. But geographically, it is located in the center of Europe. Everyone knows the truth that "whoever can control Czechoslovakia can control Europe." Therefore, if Nazi Germany wanted to expand outwards, it had to invade Czechoslovakia; the scene in Munich is an excellent example. At the same time, Czechoslovakia has a congenital defect, that is, Czechoslovakia is composed of two different ethnic groups, who quarrel with each other endlessly. Therefore, although the people ideologically tend towards democracy, and the domestic industrialization is also better than other neighboring countries, Czechoslovakia seems destined to fail. Before the First World War, Czechoslovakia became a vassal of Nazi Germany; by the end of the Second World War, President Beneš was able to rebuild Czechoslovakia, and a beautiful illusion floated before him again, seeming to be able to lead Czechoslovakia towards a democratic, social, and independent path. But for the past two and a half years, President Beneš has been trapped in a complex international political circle and has fallen into an abyss of depression. For the sake of Czechoslovakia's own needs, he needs raw materials and energy from the East on the one hand, and capital and machinery from the West on the other hand. However, the political shadows from both the East and the West are threatening the middle path he is taking. Although he longed for American material assistance, he never accepted it frankly; although he feared the infiltration of Soviet forces, he was ultimately unable to resist it! Now, the political line has changed, and the middle path has come to an end. President Beneš, who is regarded as the highest leader of the Czech nation, will soon announce his resignation! The end of those who take the middle path is truly a tragedy for Czech democracy and a blow to the prospects for world peace. The Czech Communist Party's style is like this, and the style of the communist parties in any country in the world is also like this. A lesson can be learned from the Czech tragedy: the idea of ​​cooperation and coexistence with the Communist Party is impossible; if you are not careful, you will suffer the Czech democratic tragedy!

The occurrence of this Czech political upheaval is not only a showdown between the various Czech parties, but also forcing the Western democratic countries to have a showdown soon. In order to make it easier for readers to understand, it is necessary to start with Secretary of State Marshall's proposal of the European aid plan.

The purpose of the Marshall Plan is nothing more than to use the United States' vast financial and material resources to assist the economic reconstruction of European countries, so that they do not fall into a state of chaos and be dominated by totalitarians. Objectively speaking, Marshall's motives are good and proper, and could have won the broad sympathy of all countries in the world. However, while the US aid plan to Europe is still being debated, it has aroused the Soviet Union's infinite fears and revulsion. The emergence of the new communist international in Eastern Europe, the formation of the Balkan bloc, the strengthening of the economic institutions in eastern Germany, and even this coup in Czechoslovakia are all a series of dramas directed by the Soviet Union behind the scenes. We have already said above that Czechoslovakia needs and desires American material assistance, but under external pressure, Czechoslovakia declared its withdrawal. Threatened by the domestic Communist Party, Czechoslovakia completely threw itself into the arms of the Eastern European bloc. This cannot but be said to be a major change for Czechoslovakia and a major obstacle to the US aid plan to Europe.

Judging from the Czech coup, the anti-Marshall Plan movement led by the Soviet Union has already taken the lead in terms of timing and efficiency. Looking back at the United States, the Marshall Plan is still in the stage of debate in Congress. What is the total amount? When will it be implemented? All of these are unknown. After this warning, the United States may strengthen the implementation of the Marshall Plan and promote the economic unity of Western European countries. But in any case, the United States will inevitably be at a disadvantage in its diplomatic war with the Soviet Union. Although both the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan use anti-communism as slogans, in action, they are either slow or not thorough. The Truman Doctrine has not only not been promoted to the Far East, but it has not been implemented in Europe either; Czechoslovakia has issued a warning to the United States, can the United States afford to make the same mistake again and again? Can we still stand by and watch the rampant communist parties in various countries and allow them to spread? It is time for the United States to review its foreign policy.

### New Plan for the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters; Preparing to Organize People's Salvation Vanguard Team

Training One Million Local Cadres

Talented People Returning to Hometowns with the Army to Work

[This newspaper's North China Dispatch on the 27th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Hebei Provincial Government jointly discussed the issue of talented people and model cadres returning to their hometowns with the Hebei Provincial Association of Fellow Provincials on the 26th. It is said that the Suppression Headquarters plans to complete the organization and training of 1 million local cadres in the five provinces of North China within only half a year. The name is the "People's Salvation Vanguard Team." Each county will select talented people and begin training immediately, dividing them into several teams. Each team will have 2,200 people. The integration of training and work is called "Talented People Going to the Countryside." The Hebei Provincial Government is also drastically reducing staff, and those who remain will also be sent to the countryside. Another slogan in Hebei Province is "Funds Going to the Countryside." Following this policy, a new land policy will be implemented. The original landlords in the newly recovered areas who have family members working with the army will retain two-thirds of their original land; otherwise, only enough land to make a living will be returned. The rest will be distributed to members of the People's Salvation Vanguard Team to support their families, because most of these team members will be refugees from the unrecovered areas. It is estimated that the special self-defense tax of 2,300 yuan per month will also be the main funding for "going to the countryside." Gao Can, the Suppression Headquarters staff member representing Fu Zuoyi, relayed Fu Yuanchuan's opinion, saying that if the military, government, party, and people are in step, refugees in places like Beijing and Tianjin can return to their hometowns within at most a year and a half.

### Report of British Trade Mission to China Released

Mission Leader Bowes Broadcasts to China

[British Information Service, London, 27th] The report of the British Trade Mission to China has been released. Sir Bowes, the head of the mission, gave a speech to China on the Far East program of the British Broadcasting Corporation on the afternoon of the 26th. He said that the basic conclusion of the trade mission is that China's greatest need in economic and other aspects is peace. The members of the trade mission witnessed how internal strife is eroding China's manpower and material resources, and they still heard the sounds of war. Productivity is destroyed, and important transportation routes have been destroyed. The members of the trade mission felt this deeply. Unless peace is achieved first, the enthusiastic cooperation of Chinese and foreign politicians, farmers, industrialists, and merchants will fail in their efforts to make China cooperate with the development of world trade and prosperity.

### Jing Panshi Receives Reporters

(Continued from page 1) The delayed US aid is related to our country's poor international propaganda. There are not many communist propaganda personnel in the United States, but whether they run newspapers or engage in other activities, they are much better than our government officials. Today, all major countries pay great attention to propaganda work. There are often about 3,000 well-known British people traveling and working in the United States. The Soviet Union also does not relax its propaganda to the United States. On one occasion, it was willing to pay a high price of US$100,000 for a 15-minute broadcast. Jing Panshi reported on the activities of the World Christian Leadership Association, saying that the association was formed by the merger of the two religious groups in the US and Chinese parliaments and has now expanded into an international organization. The purpose is to enable personnel at all levels in the governments of various countries to become exemplary Christians in order to improve society and further seek world peace. The General Assembly was established in Washington in January 1947. Zhou Yide is the representative of the United States. The chief representative of the United Kingdom is William, a veteran of the naval community. He served as an advisor to British Prime Minister Churchill at the Giant Conference. The Canadian representative is Judge Kellogg of the Supreme Court of Canada. Other attending representatives from various countries are also well-known people. Jing Panshi represents my country's attendance. The association has now decided to establish the Far East Council, which will be chaired by Jing Panshi. The address of the association may be set in Shanghai. As for the address of the Chinese branch, it will be set in the capital. Jing Panshi will visit Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek in Beijing in the next few days and ask for her assistance in finding an address for the association.

This anemic phenomenon cannot last long. The only solution is to restore transportation.

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The black market for gold and the sale of silver are active in Shenyang recently, resulting in many people using silver dollars as currency. The police station is cracking down severely, arresting more than 40 gold and silver dealers.

A thorough investigation has been launched based on the report.

If this is true, no matter whether it is a false claim, they will be investigated and punished without regard to personal relationships.

### Expansion of Communist Forces Knows No Bounds; The Soviet Union Applies High Pressure on Finland; Suggests Conclusion of a Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: Helsinki, Finland Report, today Finnish President Paasikivi received a concise letter from Stalin, in which he suggested that the Soviet Union and Finland sign a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance. The president convened a meeting of leaders from various parties at the presidential palace this afternoon to discuss countermeasures. Well-informed political sources believe that the Soviet Union advocates a military alliance with Finland, but all parties except the Communist Party are afraid that they will not agree to accept it. It is expected that the Finnish president will try to limit the scope of the agreement so that its nature becomes a joint resistance to any possible German aggression.

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 27th Broadcast: Washington Report, State Department experts predict that the Soviet Union's steps to "consolidate" the East will be to incorporate several satellite countries into the Soviet Union. This action may be required after the spring elections in some countries (such as Czechoslovakia) and Finland is completely under Communist control. In addition, France and Italy will also be the main targets of Communist Party activities this spring.

[United Press Helsinki, Finland, 27th Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Finland has received a proposal from the Soviet government to conclude a Soviet-Finnish treaty, but it is not yet known whether the nature of the treaty is friendship, mutual assistance, or both. Since the success of the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, rumors have been rife here that government officials from the Soviet Union and Finland are conducting negotiations on "new developments in relations between the two countries." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that the president received a personal letter from a senior Soviet official yesterday, in which the Soviet side's new plan was explained. According to well-informed sources in diplomatic circles, the president convened a meeting of external affairs officials at his official residence yesterday, and then met with other government officials. The Speaker of the National Assembly also paid a visit to the president in the evening to discuss the matter.

[United Press Paris, 26th Dispatch] Germany under Hitler's rule expanded its power outward before the war, restricting more than 100,000 square miles of land and more than 28 million people in neighboring countries. Since World War II, the Soviet Union and the Communist government have also expanded more than 200,000 square miles in Europe and the East, with their power reaching 110 million people. The scope of Communist power has far exceeded that of the Tsarist era. Czechoslovakia is the most recent country to fall into the Communist camp, but it may not be the last. The Kremlin is also paying close attention to Turkey, Italy, France, Finland, as well as East Germany and Austria. Up to now, more than 200,000 square miles of land and more than 24 million people have been incorporated into the Soviet Union during and after the war. Estonia and Lithuania were first absorbed in 1940. Two-fifths of Poland's pre-war territory, parts of Finland, Romania, Germany and the Czech Republic, have also been occupied by the Soviet Union. Japan's Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin Island have also been incorporated into the Soviet Union. Since the surrender of Germany and Japan, the westward advance of Communist forces has accelerated. Southern, Albanian, Polish, Bulgarian, Romanian, and Hungarian countries have been controlled by the Communist Party one after another, and now Czechoslovakia has followed. The area of the above countries reaches 440,000 square miles, with a total population of approximately 87 million people.

### Marshall Asks Congress to Allocate Funds; To Provide Further Assistance to Greece and Turkey; Needs 275 Million US Dollars

[United Press Washington, 26th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall sent a letter to House Speaker Martin and Senate Speaker Vandenberg today, on behalf of President Truman, proposing a bill to increase the allocation of 275 million US dollars to provide military assistance to Greece and Turkey. Congress passed a 400 million dollar aid to Turkey and Greece bill last May, and the funds are almost exhausted. If no additional funds are allocated, US aid to the two countries will end at the end of June this year. If the new bill is approved, it can continue to supply guns, ammunition, and medicines until the end of June next year. Marshall also said that if the United States stops providing assistance, totalitarian groups will take the opportunity to take over the regimes of the two countries. I believe that helping these free nations maintain their freedom is undoubtedly in our own interests and consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Turkey is currently under constant pressure, forcing it to cede military bases in the Dardanelles Strait and part of its territory to a certain country. As for other European countries, they have effectively increased their food, coal, and steel production and will be able to implement self-help under the European Recovery Program.

### British Will Reconsider the Recognition of the Government; Currently in Contact with the United States and France

[Reuters London, 26th Dispatch] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the Czech government was established through undemocratic means, so Britain will have to reconsider its recognition of the Czech government. Britain is currently in contact with the governments of the United States and France and is paying close attention to the Czech situation.

[Agence France-Presse London, 26th Dispatch] According to responsible sources, the trade negotiations planned between Britain and the Czech Republic have been temporarily suspended.

### Our Government is Concerned About the Development of the Situation in the Czech Republic

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said; We are very concerned about the coup in the Czech Republic. Deputy Minister Liu Shishun summoned the Czech Ambassador to China Li Like on the afternoon of the 26th to inquire about it. Our ambassador to the Czech Republic has not yet reported to Nanjing on this matter. We are closely monitoring the political situation in the Czech Republic and the development of international relations caused by the coup.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] A certain authoritative person recently commented on the Czech coup, saying, "This is exactly the same as the changes in Austria and the Czech Republic before World War II. The difference is that in the former, the Nazis invaded from outside, while this time it was done by the Czech Communists." He believes that the seizure of power in the Czech Republic by the Communist Party is the closure of the Eastern European curtain. Because the Czech Republic has a developed industry, a high standard of living for its people, and a strong democratic and free atmosphere, it has been holding up under the red chains for more than two years, but it still cannot avoid succumbing to force, which is a great tragedy. He also predicted that the retention of President Benes and Foreign Minister Masaryk is a means of the Czech Communist Party, and the two will eventually be driven out of the government. If Western European countries have no effective remedy for this tragic defeat of democracy, the next target of the ambitious will be Italy, and Italy, which Mussolini sowed the seeds of dictatorship, is actually more fragile than the Czech Republic. He concluded, "In today's world situation, whether in the East or the West, democracy has encountered a serious test again. Raising vigilance is a necessary condition to reverse the decline." When asked by reporters whether the economic strength of the United States, including foreign aid plans, can be expected to help reverse the decline, he said, "This is not a part of the solution, but the timing is extremely urgent."

### Small General Assembly Passes Resolution: South Korea Decides to Hold Elections, Korean Committee Prepares to Return to Korea to Work

[Reuters News Agency, Lake Success, 26th] The United Nations Small General Assembly has passed the US-proposed resolution to hold elections in South Korea by a vote of 31 to 2, with 11 abstentions. Australia and Canada voted against, while Venezuela, Sweden, Norway, and Egypt abstained. Earlier this week, the United States suggested that elections should be held immediately, regardless of Soviet opposition, to establish a Korean National Government and simultaneously establish a legislative body to prepare for the possible participation of North Korean representatives. Australian representative Mr. Halley stated that he believes that the resolution passed by the General Assembly does not authorize the Korean Committee to hold national elections, and the Small General Assembly should not handle this matter.

Mr. Halley further stated that the Australian delegation also foresees another possible danger, namely that South Korea and North Korea may produce opposing authorities, both claiming to represent the Korean people. If a national government is established in South Korea, the United Nations should not ignore the threats that government may face. The Australian delegation advocated holding elections that only serve a consultative role, so that the elected Korean representatives can exchange opinions with the United Nations Committee and the United Nations General Assembly on holding national elections, and then decide on holding elections. Swedish representative Mr. Haglov stated that Sweden's opinion is the same as Norway's, believing that it is necessary to convene a special session of the General Assembly or a consultation of the Five Powers. He believes that the answer to the Korean question lies in compromise and negotiation, and the United Nations adopting this approach may have more opportunities to achieve concrete results than other methods. Egyptian representative Mr. Fawzi expressed doubts about whether the United Nations Korean Committee can hold national elections in South Korea, or whether such elections will truly contribute to the unification of Korea. Therefore, Egypt is not in a position to support the US proposal.

[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] [Several leaders of the Korean Committee will return to Seoul next week to prepare for the election of two-thirds of the representatives to the Korean National Assembly. The remaining one-third of the representatives will be invited through Soviet cooperation. Indian representative Mr. Menon told United Press that the Korean Committee he leads is extremely pleased with this positive and resolute decision authorizing us to begin our work.

### Kim Gu and Syngman Rhee's Reactions Differ

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 27th] Regarding the resolution of the United Nations Korean Committee to hold general elections separately in South Korea, the reactions of the central authorities in South Korea are as follows: Syngman Rhee stated, "I am determined to fully implement the general elections in South Korea and hope that the people of the whole country will cooperate." Kim Gu stated, "I oppose the separate elections in South Korea and the People's Republic of Korea in North Korea, which will divide the fatherland. I firmly advocate that the North and South must be unified." Kim Kyu-sik also stated, "The resolution of the United Nations Korean Committee cannot be opposed, but I will withdraw from all political activities from now on."

### Czechoslovakian Communist Party Cabinet Takes Office, Clears Out Dissidents and Implements Soviet Policies

[Reuters, London, 26th] Prague Radio announced that the new Czech cabinet was sworn in today, pledging allegiance to the President of the Republic and officially taking office.

[United Press, Prague, 26th] According to highly reliable sources today, President Beneš is currently considering resigning, but this has not been confirmed. However, it is understood that if Beneš resigns one day, Fierlinger, the pro-communist leader of the Social Democratic Party, will succeed him as president.

[Reuters, Prague, 26th] The Czech coup has entered its second stage. The Communist Party has simultaneously launched actions to control the central and local governments, as well as to purge disloyal elements from public and private life. Communist Justice Minister Bikah recently revealed that Action Committees have taken over various government agencies. A provincial "Action Committee" to control provincial affairs will be established on Friday, and a district "Action Committee" to control township affairs will be established on March 2nd. After its establishment, it is expected that there will be a long period of rectifying "disloyal elements" to purge all those who oppose the new national front and the Communist Party's plans.

At the same time, President Beneš's scheduled national broadcast address has not yet been delivered. He has not made any public statements since the establishment of the new government.

The following is a summary of the national "rectification" campaign: External Action Committees will begin to rectify internal and foreign diplomatic personnel. Slovak Democratic Party Executive Committee member Polak stated that he has organized an Action Committee to reorganize the Slovak Democratic Party. Similar reorganization movements are taking place in other right-wing parties. The National Assembly Action Committee held its first meeting in Prague yesterday, after which it called on all members of parliament to support the principles of people's democracy, "except for those who created the crisis," to show their sincerity in resolving the crisis. Twenty-four people in charge of the Bata shoe factory, including the assistant general manager and four directors, have been dismissed.

At the same time, measures such as the nationalization of enterprises and land reform are expected to be implemented soon. Enterprises with more than 50 employees are expected to be converted into public ownership, and private land with more than 50 hectares will be forcibly registered for distribution to farmers. Prague is in a quiet state today. Special guards at various government agencies have been removed, and people across the country are celebrating the failure of the rebellious forces. Public and private buildings are flying flags for three days to show their celebration.

The Method of [That Which Can Be Tolerated, What Cannot Be Tolerated]

When Soviet troops began entering Romania in April 1944, relations between the Soviet Union and the Balkan countries began to occupy a prominent place in our diplomacy.

Many newspapers speculated whether the Soviet Union's aim was liberation or possession. On May 30, 1944, British Ambassador Halifax suddenly asked me what our country's feeling would be if Britain and the Soviet Union devised a method whereby the Soviet Union could have control in Romania and Britain could have control in Greece.

He handed me a written document from his government, asking whether we would object if Britain and the Soviet Union reached an agreement whereby, in general terms, Romanian affairs would be managed by the Soviet government and Greek affairs would be managed by the United Kingdom. This Anglo-Soviet understanding would only apply in wartime and would not affect the rights and responsibilities that any of the three major powers must exercise in a peaceful settlement.

The British Foreign Office said that the United Kingdom government was well aware that dividing the Balkan countries into spheres of influence should be avoided as much as possible, and even the impression of doing so should be prevented.

After telling Halifax that I would give this matter serious consideration, I said frankly:

At first glance, it is highly questionable to abandon the policies, principles, and methods of our broad basic declaration, given that one government after another has accused each other of interfering in the economic, political, military, and other internal affairs of the Balkan countries and other European countries, and such accusations are certain to continue to occur in the future. If the original proposition is deviated from in one or two important respects, as you suggest, then neither of the two countries involved in this action will have a precedent or any fixed rule to follow, or to insist that other governments must follow.

In fact, I was frankly opposed to dividing any part of Europe into spheres of influence. I had strongly opposed it at the Moscow Conference, and in my view, the establishment of any sphere of influence would inevitably sow the seeds of future conflict. I felt that spheres of influence would inevitably undermine the supreme authority of international security institutions, which I expected to emerge.

I did not, and do not now, believe in the idea of maintaining peace through a balance of power or spheres of influence.

The next day, May 31, Prime Minister Churchill telegraphed the President directly, strongly advocating that we approve the proposed agreement. Halifax had undoubtedly telegraphed him my opinion. He stated that Britain did not want to divide the Balkan countries into spheres of influence, that this method was only applicable in wartime, and that the US and British governments would continue their current cooperation without change in formulating and implementing Allied policies towards Greece and Romania.

His telegram provided two additional pieces of information: first, that the agreement had been proposed to Soviet Ambassador Gusev in London by the British government; and second, that the Soviet side had informed the British side on May 18 that they agreed with the proposal, but before they could give a final guarantee, they wanted to know whether they had consulted with the US government and whether we agreed with the method.

Roosevelt sent me the telegram for consideration and asked me to draft a reply.

My colleagues in the State Department agreed with my original attitude towards Halifax, that we could not support such agreements and that we should, in fact, restrain them as much as possible.

While this reply was being prepared in the State Department, another telegram arrived from the Prime Minister on June 8. He reiterated that there was no question of spheres of influence involved. He seemed to be saying again that although we must act together, someone must take action. In his view, the Soviets should deal with the Romanians and Bulgarians, and the British should deal with the Greeks, because Greece was within the British theater of operations and was an old ally of Britain, for whom Britain had sacrificed 40,000 men in 1941. He also said this was accurate for Yugoslavia.

Mr. Churchill expressed his opinion that he had been trying to keep him informed of all the circumstances, but that Britain was dealing with Greek affairs and had to act with extreme caution so that the Soviets could agree. He pointed out that the situation in the Balkans was evolving very quickly.

He said that Britain always tried to follow America's lead in South America, as long as it did not involve its own food issues. As for matters of its own vital interest, then for the sake of "filial" relations, it would of course take a strong stand.

This telegram was important because it raised two countries that the British side had not mentioned until now—Bulgaria, to be handled by the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia, to be handled by the United Kingdom. So opposing this approach now seemed more urgent than ever, because doing so would place one group of countries under the Soviet Union and another group under the United Kingdom.

On June 10, the President sent our reply to the Prime Minister. In his reply, the President acknowledged that the government responsible for military operations in any country—Britain being militarily responsible for Greece and the Soviet Union for Romania—sometimes had to make decisions for the needs of military development. But we believed that the agreement proposed by the British would inevitably strengthen the natural tendency for such decisions to extend into the political and economic spheres. The President expressed the opinion that this tendency would inevitably cause constant disagreements between Britain and the Soviet Union and divide the Balkan countries into spheres of influence, even though Churchill said the agreement was limited to military aspects. The President concluded by saying that we hoped to establish a consultative body for the Balkans to eliminate misunderstandings and prevent the continued development of independent spheres of influence.

The Prime Minister sent a strong reply the next day—June 11—stating that the President's telegram made him very worried. He said that if everyone had to consult with everyone else before taking action, action would be paralyzed. Developments in the Balkans often evolved faster than changes in the overall situation.

Mr. Churchill gave two examples of how direct action he had taken at the time had resolved the situation—the mutiny of the Greek army in Istria and the potential difficulties in Egypt. If Britain had to consult with other countries, and three or four countries had to telegraph each other, the result could be chaos and unmanageability.

He expressed the opinion that the President's telegram to him during the Greek crisis had had a startling effect. He and the President were in complete agreement, and the result was completely satisfactory. He asked why all this effective guidance should be dispersed to incompetent officials on a committee, who were currently scattered around the world. He also asked why he and the President could not keep this guidance in their own hands, since they were much closer to everything.

The Prime Minister finally suggested trying his proposed method for three months, after which it would be reviewed by the three powers.

When this telegram arrived, I was in Pennsylvania taking a few days off at Hanshee. The President did not consult with me or the State Department and replied the next day, accepting the Prime Minister's proposal to try it for three months, but stating that everything must be done carefully so as to make it clear that it was not establishing a postwar sphere of influence.

The President did not inform the State Department of this action.

I returned to Washington at that time. On the day I returned—June 12—not knowing about the President's telegram to the Prime Minister, we sent a memorandum that the President had previously approved to the British Embassy, in which we listed the arguments against the proposed Anglo-Soviet agreement.

On June 17, still unaware of the President's telegram to the Prime Minister on June 12, I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister, pointing out that Churchill was openly applying his proposal to the entire Balkan region, since he had raised Bulgaria and Yugoslavia in addition to Romania and Greece, and pointing out that he had cited our position in South America as a metaphor.

I said, "Although Mr. Churchill has reiterated the British position, it does not overcome our opposition or seem to change our view of this dangerous proposal."

I also called his attention to what I considered to be "the most perplexing aspect of the matter"—that the British had not discussed a proposal of this nature with us until after it had been made to the Soviets and the latter had inquired whether we had been consulted beforehand.

The British Foreign Office had stated that the entire proposal had arisen from a chance remark by Eden to Ambassador Gusev, but Mr. Churchill had clearly stated in his frank telegram of May 31 that Britain had indicated to the Soviet Ambassador that Britain and the Soviet Union should reach their own agreement on Romania and Greece. I said, "The Prime Minister's telegram shows that our government will face an already established sphere of influence agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union, should the Soviet side immediately agree without raising the question of our position."

On June 28, a telegram from our ambassador to Greece, Lincoln MacVeagh (the embassy was then located in Cairo), drew our attention, informing us that his British counterpart had informed him that the US government had agreed to the proposal, with the proviso that it be reviewed again after three months. This was our first indication of the President's decision on June 12.

I wrote a letter to the President, which I sent to him the next day, enclosing the contents of Ambassador MacVeagh's telegram and asking him whether our position had changed.

The President replied on June 30, enclosing only a few sections or summaries of the telegrams he had exchanged with Mr. Churchill.

These included the telegram drafted by the State Department and sent by me to the President on June 17 for dispatch to Mr. Churchill. This telegram was sent to the Prime Minister by the President on June 22, in which he said that he was somewhat concerned about the situation in the Balkans, as was the State Department. He said that the fact that Britain had only raised this issue with us after it had proposed it to the Soviets and the latter had inquired whether we agreed was indeed quite perplexing to us. He said that in the future he hoped to prevent such important matters from developing along this route.

The Prime Minister replied the next day—June 23—saying that he did not admit that he had done anything wrong. He pointed out that the people of the three countries were scattered in different parts of the world, and that if one country had to notify the third party of any proposal to another country, it would be impossible to work together effectively. He gave an example of the President sending a telegram to U.J. about his conversation with Prime Minister Mikolajczyk of Poland without informing Churchill beforehand. (The President and Prime Minister sometimes used the abbreviation U.J. for Uncle Joe to refer to Stalin.)

Mr. Roosevelt replied on June 26, saying that in his view, they had all inadvertently taken unilateral action, and that they now all agreed that this was due to the urgent needs of the time. He insisted that they should always maintain consistency on all issues relating to the Allied war effort. He then sent Mr. Churchill a copy of the telegram he had sent to Stalin about his conversation with Mikolajczyk.

Subsequent events fully confirmed our fears about this Anglo-Soviet approach, which had taken effect under the President's approval. When Prime Minister Churchill and Eden went to Moscow in October 1944 to meet with Stalin and Molotov, they took this approach a step further, even stipulating the percentages of influence that Britain and the Soviet Union would have in the Balkan countries. Telegrams from our embassies in Moscow and Ankara mentioned that the Soviet Union had a 75-to-25 or 80-to-20 advantage in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, while Britain and the Soviet Union would divide Yugoslavia equally at 50-to-50. Later, the Soviets came to believe that under the June 1944 agreement, the US and Britain had treated part of the Balkans, including Romania and Bulgaria, as their sphere of influence. This assumption had a negative impact during the Yalta Conference in February 1945.

If it is unavoidable to adjust the selling prices of their supplied materials, they should at least obtain the consent of the local government in advance before implementing it.

(C) Regarding how to stabilize the prices of public utilities: It is recommended that the central government restore the subsidy system for public utilities and transportation, and at least for the necessary materials and fuels (such as coal, diesel, and gasoline) required by these utilities, the government should set a relatively stable allocation or exchange rate within three months in order to reduce the factors causing price increases in public utilities and transportation.

[Our reporter] The "Sky Shop" jointly organized by the American Atlas Materials Company and Mobil Oil Company flew from Hong Kong to Longhua Airport in the city at 12:30 pm yesterday. Zhang Peter, head of the Municipal Government's Liaison Section, and Mobil Oil Company staff members welcomed them at the airport. The "Sky Shop" is a DC-4 type four-engine giant aircraft. The fuselage is silver and red, and the national flags of various countries around the world are painted in two rows near the cabin door, all of which have been flown by the aircraft. They include the United States, Canada, Cuba, Panama, Canal Zone, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Trinidad, Dominica, Puerto Rico, Liberia, Congo, Union of South Africa, Egypt, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, India, Sikkim, Siam, Annam, Hong Kong, and other places. The national flags of various countries are colorful and beautiful. However, the display inside the fuselage is not as novel and rich as imagined. The seats are exactly the same as those of ordinary DC-4 type aircraft. Only photos of Mobil gas stations are pasted on both walls, and various samples of tires, batteries, chargers, spark plugs, and paints, as well as automobile lights and flashlights, are displayed at the front of the fuselage near the nose, totaling about dozens of items. Among them, the more special one is a fast and safe battery charger that can charge in a car within an hour. As for the room on the plane rumored to be used to show 16mm movies, it was not seen yesterday. After a comprehensive visit, the reporter's impression was that the "Sky Shop" was just an ordinary airplane displaying some merchandise. The eight people who arrived in Shanghai on the plane yesterday were Atlas Company President Bei Zong and others, four representatives from Mobil Park Company including Davis, and six people including the driver and telegraph operator. They all stayed at the Mao Hotel and will host a grand banquet for leaders from all walks of life in the city tonight. Tomorrow, they will host a tour at Longhua Airport.

### Please Postpone Enforcement of the Dance Ban Before the Reemployment Issue is Resolved

[Report from Our Newspaper] Results of the Social Affairs Committee Review Meeting: (1) Regarding the case of "Please severely punish the instigators and followers who destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau, release the innocent, and withdraw the order to ban dancing," the review opinion: (A) Request the government to severely punish the rioters who destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau in accordance with the law, and promptly release those whose crimes are insufficient. (B) Considering that stability is paramount during this period of suppressing the rebellion, Shanghai dance halls have a long history, and a large number of people are employed in the industry. No less than tens of thousands of people directly depend on it for their livelihoods. The situation is indeed different from that of other cities. Therefore, before the issue of reemployment for corrupt employees and dancers can be properly resolved, the Municipal Government should be requested to forward the previous resolution of the General Assembly to the Central Government for temporary suspension of enforcement.

The effectiveness of the above work is still insufficient.

At this point, Song and Hou finally admitted to conspiring to smuggle opium from Jinzhou, Northeast, to Shanghai for sale. They claimed that they had done this three times before, and upon arriving in Shanghai, they had sold it to Liu Xihan at No. 13, Caiyang Lane, Xiaojiuhua Street, Nanshi. According to their testimony, the squad immediately sent officers to search the address. Liu had already fled, and only his concubine, Liu Hansuying, was found. However, three pieces of opium, weighing a total of 26 ounces, were also found there. At around 8:00 AM yesterday, the team members who remained at the Far East Hotel detained another person named Shu Kanghou, who came to the place to negotiate the purchase of opium. He claimed to be a retired battalion commander and also a fellow accomplice. From his testimony, it was revealed that a drug addict and dealer named Shi Han resided at No. 17, Jindeli, Xinghua Street, Nanshi. Officers were immediately dispatched to arrest Shi and his wife. Finally, another accomplice, Zhang Tongcheng, was arrested in the Xinping Apartments on Taicang Road. In total, twelve suspects, men and women, were arrested in this case and are currently being detained in the first brigade for further interrogation.

### Thrifty Vegetable Prices to Increase by Onefold: The Social Affairs Bureau is Reviewing the Report

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Wine and Vegetable Industry Association previously submitted a report stating that the thrifty vegetable prices for banquets stipulated by the authorities were no longer viable due to fluctuations in commodity prices and rising raw material costs. They requested permission to adjust prices themselves at any time and report them to the Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping, as applying for price adjustments through official channels was cumbersome and time-consuming. Director Wu believes that the industry can determine the average price of several major ingredients and use the extent of their price fluctuations as the standard for setting banquet prices. The Wine and Vegetable Industry Association has now stipulated that the average price of five ingredients - chicken, meat, fish, duck, and shrimp - will be used as the standard for Chinese-style banquets, the average price of three ingredients - chicken, fish, and pork - will be used as the standard for Western-style banquets, and the average price of rice will be used as the standard for Chinese and Western economy meals. Based on the above standards, the association submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting an increase of 100% over the previously stipulated prices, with the highest price for a Chinese-style banquet being 3.6 million yuan per table, the highest price for a Western-style meal being 360,000 yuan per person, and the highest price for both Chinese and Western economy meals being 70,000 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently reviewing the request.

### The Special Donation Fundraising Committee Formally Established Yesterday; Difficulties in Implementation Due to Lack of Standards for the Wealthy

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Relief Special Donation Fundraising Committee held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the municipal government conference room. Present were Director Wu Guozhen, Deputy Directors Pan Gongzhan and Du Yuesheng, and committee members Wu Yun Chu, Xi Wang, Xu Jiqing, Jing Yunzhang, Qin Runqing, Shui Xiangyun, Wang Xianqing, Wu Kaixian, and others, who jointly discussed fundraising methods. According to Mayor Wu, after the meeting, he told reporters: "The implementation of special relief donations is quite difficult. There has never been an accurate survey of the people's property in this city, and it is difficult to set standards for the wealthy. Furthermore, the central government has not provided detailed measures, so I only know to designate targets and ask them to donate money voluntarily. If they do not donate, I will send someone to urge them to pay. If they still ignore me after urging, I don't know what to do."

### Property Investigation Intends to Draft a List

According to the three resolutions made at the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Relief Committee in Nanjing on the 26th: (1) The total amount of donations in the Shanghai area is 550 billion yuan; (2) The Shanghai area includes Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places; (3) Donation targets: (A) Those with exceptionally high incomes during the War of Resistance and the Suppression of Rebellion; (B) Large merchants and tycoons; (C) Social legal entities with strong financial resources and thriving businesses. Furthermore, according to the central government's regulations, the list of donation targets in the Shanghai area should be submitted by March 15th. The municipal government has now decided to start investigating the property of the wealthy and draft a list, while also telegraphing the central government to clarify the detailed measures as soon as possible, so that they can be followed. As for Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places, the committee has suggested that each place nominate the speaker of the local council to serve on the committee and be responsible for the implementation of special relief donations in that area.

### Fire Breaks Out on the Huangpu River at Midnight; The Victory Steamer Catches Fire and Sinks; Crew Unharmed

[Our Newspaper] The Victory steamer of Tongyu Shipping Company, with a deadweight of 1,000 tons, was carrying sleepers from the Ministry of Communications to Nanjing. The ship was berthed at buoy number 15 on the Nanshi Huangpu River and had been loading cargo for several days. The ship burned diesel oil, so it had eighty barrels of diesel oil stored on board. At about 2:00 AM yesterday, there was a sudden accident in the furnace room. Because the crew members were all asleep at night, when they discovered the fire, the diesel oil had already caught fire, and the fire was fierce. They immediately sounded the horn for help. The Jianghai Customs Fire Brigade was notified and sent multiple fireboats to extinguish the fire. However, because the diesel oil and sleepers in the ship were all flammable, the fire was uncontrollable, and the deck was completely on fire. Around 3:00 AM, the ropes tied to the buoy were burned, and it was high tide. The ship drifted south with the tide to Xuejia浜 Huangpu River, where it capsized and sank. Fortunately, the crew had already left the ship and were all unharmed.

### Visiting the Sino-Belgian Railway Company: Prosperous Belgium

— Third Letter, Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

[Our Newspaper, Brussels, 17th (Airmail)] During my stay in Brussels, I met Consul General Wang Kexun, a "China expert," at the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This Belgian diplomat, who has lived in China for over thirty years, knows Chinese customs, habits, and social practices. His original name seems to be pronounced "Wen Kouhui." The three characters Wang Kexun were given to him by a Chinese friend. He arrived in China in 1911, the year of the Wuchang Uprising, and served as consul in Tianjin, Hankou, and Harbin. He spent the last ten years as consul general in Shanghai before being recalled to the ministry last year. All the officials, big and small, in the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs still call him "Consul General." He is quite popular among the public.

I asked "Consul General" if he would like to return to China again. He said: It would be best to have the opportunity to return to China to do business. I believe this statement is not only Wang Kexun's personal opinion; it represents the common view of the Belgian business community, large and small. Belgian engineers and Belgian capital once helped us build the Pinghan Railway, the Longhai Railway, the Yaohua Glass Factory in Qinhuangdao, and even participated in the creation of the Hanyeping Company. In the late years of the late Qing Dynasty, through the hands of Zhang Zhidong and Sheng Xuanhuai, who advocated "foreign affairs," we made considerable use of Belgian "foreign capital," and there were no political disputes between China and Belgium caused by Belgian foreign capital.

Industrial Investment

A Chinese person who has resided in Belgium for many years said: In the late 19th century, during the reign of Emperor Leopold II, Belgium may have had some "ambitions" toward China. Emperor Leopold II specially invited Li Hongzhang to Beijing and treated him with great courtesy. At that time, the Belgian government also seemed to have some ideas. China was not divided during the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion, followed by the Xinhai Revolution and the First European War. Belgium no longer had any "political ambitions" toward China. That friend's conclusion was quite clever: Today, if we talk about economic cooperation with Belgium, as long as we succeed, we will not be fooled!

How can we succeed? I casually discussed this with Consul General Wang Kexun in my capacity as a journalist. He said: National loans must go through formal diplomatic "contact." In the two years since the war, the Chinese government has only asked the United States for money and has never mentioned it to Belgium. "Of course," he said, "Belgium does not yet have the ability to release foreign exchange, but industrial investment, such as building factories, especially building railways, is something that Belgium has an interest in and the ability to do!"

President Jadot

I thank Acting Chargé d'Affaires Qu Chunbo for introducing me to Mr. Jadot, President of the "Sino-Belgian Railway Company," an honest industrialist of 75 years old. Mr. Jadot's full name is Jules Jadot. His brother, Jean Jadot, was the chief engineer who built the Pinghan Railway. Jules Jadot also lived in China for a long time. After returning to Belgium, he became the president of the Sino-Belgian Railway Company. Last October, the company's name was changed to "Far East Railway Company," but in practice, it still focuses on China. The company's English secretary, Mr. Hautefeuille, put it well: "Our company's target is still only China. Therefore, we fully support investing more in China, because this is our profession and our livelihood!"

Secretary Muller

I visited Mr. Jadot's residence at 32 Rue de la Science in Brussels. This 75-year-old "friend of China" was bedridden. I presented him with a bouquet of flowers on behalf of Shen Bao. The next day, I met Mr. Muller, the company's chief secretary and the person most responsible for all business, at the company's office on Rue de l'Industrie. He told me that the Pinghan Railway was built by their company. Three years before the Xinhai Revolution, in 1908, the Manchu Qing government prepared funds to purchase it and returned it to Chinese state ownership. Today, the Longhai Railway's bond coupons are still held by the company, because the Longhai's bond coupons were not worth much during the Chinese war, so the company completely stored them and did not trade them on the stock market. Mr. Muller did not mention the Longhai Railway's profit and loss situation. He only said that before 1937, the company sent a batch of locomotives and railway equipment to the Pinghan and Longhai railways, and the Chinese side has not yet cleared this payment.

Building Railways

I told him that although there are disturbances in China at present, the southern and southwestern provinces are very peaceful and suitable for investment. Does the "Far East Railway Company" have any plans to invest in building some new railways in China? He was very interested and said that when Mr. Ling Hongxun came to Belgium last year, he once talked about building railways in South China, but later he did not hear any concrete plans from the Chinese side, and there was no formal discussion in Sino-Belgian diplomacy. He also said that according to the company's principles for foreign investment, there must first be a guarantee from the Belgian government and the Belgian National Bank. How can the Belgian government guarantee? It completely depends on the formal diplomatic negotiations between the Chinese and Belgian governments. He said that the Belgian side is very interested in this, but the question is whether the Chinese government will propose it first. In addition, he also said: "The second question is the payment after the railway is built. In the past, Chinese payments were all made through the Bank of England, based on the pound sterling. In the future, we hope to change to US dollars as the basis."

Finding Customers

Mr. Muller also said that the Far East Railway Company has an office in Shanghai, located in Room 307, 150 Jiujiang Road. "The director of the office there, Mr. Reynart, is a capable and astute character." He also told me in passing that last month, Mr. Reynart flew from Shanghai to Guangzhou to see Chairman Song Shiwen. I asked him if it was related to negotiations on railway investment in South China. He laughed: "Of course, China needs railway construction!"

I asked them about the production of steel and railway equipment in Belgium. Mr. Hautefeuille, the English secretary, replied that Belgium's heavy industrial production has not only recovered to pre-war levels, but many sectors have far exceeded pre-war levels. "For example, new rails are currently piled up like mountains. The main thing is to find customers, customers who can pay cash!"

Consul General Wang

This is what Consul General Wang Kedong told me: "France and Belgium cannot be mentioned in the same breath." That day, Consul General Wang Kexun had just returned to Beijing from Paris. He saw tens of thousands of French people protesting outside the parliament, demanding that the parliament reject the government's proposal to "abolish the 5,000-franc banknote." Consul General Wang stretched out his hands and said: "Fortunately, we Belgians are not so corrupt. There are few communists in Belgium, and few strikes, so we are recovering faster!"

Because the time was too short, I did not meet Mr. Etienne, the vice president of the Belgian National Railway Company, a close friend of Acting Chargé d'Affaires Qu Chunbo. Mr. Etienne's secretary took me to visit various departments. It was a large enterprise organization with thousands of employees. I went from upstairs to downstairs, and then from downstairs to upstairs in the elevator. The scene of such a large enterprise proved the strength of the Belgian railway industry. In the residence of a Chinese overseas Chinese, I saw a detailed map of the Belgian national railway network. Almost every city and town has main or branch railway lines. Many overseas Chinese who do business can spend 5,000 francs a month to buy a long-term "pass" and travel all over the country, which is very convenient.

Overseas Chinese in Belgium

There are very few overseas Chinese in Belgium, less than one hundred in total. They have an organization called the "Association of Chinese Merchants in Belgium," whose president is Ni Zuoyou, an honest and upright old man. Most of the overseas Chinese are engaged in the leather business, manufacturing leather bags, wallets, and the like. Their economic situation is far inferior to that of the Netherlands. There are no Chinese restaurants in Brussels. It is said that some overseas Chinese leaders from the Netherlands and Paris are raising funds to prepare a large-scale Chinese restaurant in Brussels. They have already invested more than 30,000 US dollars just in housing and property.

Remittance Restrictions

Belgium's remittance of overseas Chinese money back to China is a great diplomatic success in Europe. In 1945, Acting Chargé d'Affaires Qu Chunbo contacted the Belgian financial authorities, and the Belgian National Bank agreed that overseas Chinese could remit 5,000 Belgian francs per person per month, about 115 US dollars. Those with families could remit 10,000 francs. Overseas Chinese remittances must first be certified by the Chinese Merchants Association, and then go to the embassy to obtain a remittance application form, which must state "According to the Belgian authorities' letter of that year and month, how many francs are allowed to be remitted." It is said that the Belgian foreign exchange control authorities are a little regretful about this, because the amount was set too high (France only allows overseas Chinese to remit 5,000 French francs per year, about 17 US dollars), but Qu Chunbo said: "This is a done deal, and no one can renege!" It is said that in 1946 alone, the total amount of remittances from overseas Chinese in Belgium back to China exceeded one million Belgian francs.

However, the crisis is that the small handicrafts of the overseas Chinese are now declining day by day. They earn less money, living is expensive, and there is also competition among themselves. Every time I pass through Belgium and see our hard-working overseas Chinese, and then think of their large enterprises and foreign investment, I feel an infinite sense of vigilance!

### Major Massacre in Dongchen Town, Rugao; Jiang Family, Father and Three Sons, Die by Gunfire on the Same Day

[Rugao, 22nd] An unprecedented massacre occurred in Dongchen Town, the second district of this county, on the night of the 17th of this month. Our reporter has personally investigated it, and the report is as follows: The Jiangwu Township office, located in Chexiang County, is constantly moving near the town. That evening, Li Hechou (Zi Fengming), the head of the township, claimed that he ambushed bandit troops in the township and instructed Jiang Baishou, the township squad leader, to accompany him in leading the team. When they arrived at the Jiang family temple north of the town, Township Head Li shot Squad Leader Jiang in the shoulder with one bullet. Jiang fell to the ground injured and asked loudly. Township Head Li replied that it was a "misfire." Jiang did not suspect anything because Li was not familiar with shooting. He struggled to stand up, but Li fired another shot, piercing Jiang's ribs, and quickly snatched Jiang's pistol. He ordered the team members to shoot. The team members looked at each other in astonishment. Li claimed that Squad Leader Jiang was colluding with bandits and should be executed, and designated a team member to shoot. Ignoring Jiang's cries of injustice, Jiang Baishou knew that it would be difficult to escape, and because he was in unbearable pain, he urged the team member to shoot. He died by gunfire on the spot. Li then led the team back to the residence of Jiang's father, Xi Xian (who served as the chief of the first bao in the township), opened the gate, tied up Jiang Xixian and his second son, Bainian, and executed them in the town, respectively, in Taiping Lane south of the town and on Beijie Street. The Jiang family, father and three sons, died on the same day. Li convened a meeting of bao chiefs that night, claiming that the Jiang family and his sons were colluding with bandits and had been executed, and took out half a piece of sloppily written letter from his bag as evidence. Afterwards, the residents heard about it and were shocked. After a detailed investigation, it was revealed that the township head had served as a puppet township head before the surrender of the enemy and puppets, and was very powerful for a time. He was accustomed to using assassination tactics. This time, he neither reported to his superiors nor sent them to the district for investigation. He falsely claimed a misfire first and assassinated Xixian and his sons later, which was obviously revenge killing. It is said that Township Head Li was afraid that the matter would escalate and went to the district office on the 20th to lobby and arrested a bandit's family member in the township, forcing them to confess that the Jiang family and his sons had delivered letters to the bandits.

### The Jingwu Railway Will Start Construction, with Track-laying Project Conducted in Three Phases

[Huizhou, 24th] The Jiangnan Railway Company is the only private railway in the country. Before the war, it had achieved brilliant success. At that time, the section from Beijing to Sunjiabu in Xuancheng, with a total length of more than 200 kilometers, was officially opened to traffic. Now, the company has decided to re-lay the tracks on this road and has drawn up a reconstruction plan. The track-laying project will be carried out in three phases: the first phase is from Beijing to Wuhu, with a total length of 91 kilometers; the second phase is from Beijing to Huizhou, with a total length of more than 300 kilometers; the third phase is from Huizhou extending to Guixi, Jiangxi, connecting with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, with a total length of more than 600 kilometers. It is currently estimated that laying 100 kilometers of railway will cost approximately 870,000 US dollars. After the company requested funding, it obtained a loan of 800,000 US dollars in foreign exchange from the Joint Treasury, which was approved by the Central Bank at the end of last year. This loan is sufficient to lay the tracks for the Beijing-Wuhu section. The loan contract stipulates that it will be repaid in 24 installments within two years, starting from June this year.

The roadbed from Beijing to Wuhu is intact. The sleepers ordered in the United States have recently arrived one after another. The company has also ordered 19 new passenger cars in the United States for use when the railway opens to traffic. The plan for the first phase of traffic to Wuhu only awaits the return of the rails before construction can begin. It is estimated that the entire section will be completed in March of this year and can be officially opened to traffic in April.

### Jiangxi Porcelain Sales Are Outstanding

[Jingdezhen, 20th] The sales of porcelain in this city have gradually become active after winter.

### Zhu Shaozhou Talks About Shaanxi Politics

[Xi'an, 27th] Shaanxi Province Chairman Zhu Shaozhou met with our reporter alone this morning. The chairman reviewed his administration over the past four years in a humble tone. First of all, he praised the farmers in Guanzhong for their innocence and simplicity, so he often wanted to get close to the common people in order to understand their hardships. He expressed his satisfaction with his achievements in Shaanxi's water conservancy and anti-opium administration, especially the stability of the province over the past four years, whether during the War of Resistance or the Suppression of Rebellion, which was most commendable.

### Sichuan Provincial Government Convenes Conference on Complete Prohibition of Opium

[Chengdu, 27th] Sichuan Province's period for the complete prohibition of opium is about to expire this month. The provincial government convened a Sichuan Opium Prohibition Conference, presided over by Deng Xihou, to review the opium prohibition administration and discuss the follow-up work. The provincial government has now issued an order to the entire province, requiring all cities and counties to submit a written guarantee of complete eradication by the end of the month. Next month, the provincial government will conduct a province-wide general inspection, and the Headquarters will conduct a final review, to ensure the permanent eradication of opium.

### Yunnan Yi People Resist the Eradication of Opium Seedlings; The Entire Case Has Been Successfully Resolved

[Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Interior previously received a report from Lei Moynan, the special envoy for opium prohibition in the Yunnan-Guizhou region, on January 11th of this year, stating that a portion of the evil people in Ruili, Yunnan, were resisting the eradication of opium seedlings and plotting to attack the administrative bureau. Also: Kunming Chairman Lu Han telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan, stating: According to the report from Shu Zitian, the director of the Ruili Administrative Bureau: Ruili and Longchuan are adjacent, and Yi people in the Lingwei Jiaoshan area are resisting eradication, surrounding the eradication personnel, and uniting with more than 200 Han Chinese in Longchuan to surround and attack the administrative bureau. The Yunnan Provincial Government immediately telegraphed the garrison command and ordered the garrison troops in Wan町 to rush to assist in suppression, while instructing the district commissioner to enlighten the people and ordering the local chieftains to find ways to quell the situation as a military and political double-pronged approach. After receiving the above report, the Ministry of Interior immediately telegraphed the Yunnan Provincial Government to strictly and quickly investigate and ordered the opium prohibition special envoy Lei Moynan to properly supervise the handling. Later, Kunming Chairman Lu Han telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan on February 2nd, stating: The incident was enlightened by chieftains such as Xian Jintai, and the native people had already dispersed and returned to the mountains. At the same time, the Ministry of Interior also received a telegram from the special envoy Lei, stating that when the special envoy arrived in Wan町, together with Regiment Commander Lu Weiyi of the reorganized 26th Division, who was sent to suppress the situation, they decided to loudly announce an attack while also motivating the chieftains related to the Yi people resisting eradication to understand the pros and cons and order them to disband within a time limit and await government disposal. If they continued to be stubborn, they would be suppressed. Within a few days, they voluntarily disbanded and order was restored. The above is the process that has been gone through and resolved. As for the cause of the conflict, the aftermath, and whether the responsible personnel were negligent in provoking the incident, it is currently being continuously ordered to be investigated and reported for verification. In addition, Mo Ganer, an Yi person from Ebian County in Sichuan Province's fifth district, relying on his military force, also resisted eradication. The district commissioner Liu Renan led a team to supervise the suppression, and it has already been quelled.

### Qingdao Small Civil Servants Exhaust Their Possessions, Wife Disappears, and He Hangs Himself by the Window

[Qingdao, 24th (Airmail)] Sun Xiaofeng, 34, from Yexian, worked as a clerk in the document section of the Social Affairs Bureau. He was diligent and honest. Last autumn, he took too much sick leave and was laid off. Later, he lived by pawning and borrowing money. After the Spring Festival, even the quilt he covered was gone. His wife could not bear to suffer from the cold and hunger any longer and suddenly left him on the 19th. Sun, hungry, inquired about his wife's whereabouts everywhere. After five days without news, he hanged himself by the window in his residence (the dormitory for Social Affairs Bureau staff) yesterday afternoon.

### Three-Wheeled Motorcycles Operate on the Jialou Road, Rickshaw Pullers' Business Becomes a Problem, Both Sides Perform a Full-Scale Fight

[Jiading, 24th] The dispute between rickshaw pullers and three-wheeled motorcycles over the operation on the Jia (ding) Lou (tang) Road is being mediated by the authorities. Unexpectedly, at about 10:30 AM on the 24th, rickshaw pullers, citing livelihood issues, spontaneously gathered dozens of rickshaw pullers to negotiate with the three-wheeled motorcycle drivers outside the north gate, without results. Rickshaw puller Liu Jixian took the lead in smashing the motorcycle windows. Wang, an official from the Loutang Town Office who was a passenger, saw the seriousness of the situation and fired two shots into the sky with his self-defense pistol, causing a misunderstanding among the rickshaw pullers, who rushed forward, ready to respond with force. The Jiading Station north gate parking lot for motorcycles was located opposite the Qia Shun Tai store. The workers of the store witnessed this and were filled with injustice. They each held sticks and assisted the motorcycle drivers in confronting the rickshaw pullers head-on, making the situation even more serious.

### Lánzhōu School Official Conflict: Wang Shuangke Beaten, Petition Demands Four Conditions

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 27th] On the evening of the 25th, at around 10 p.m., four Lanzhou University students had a minor conflict with four on-duty soldiers from the 22nd Conscript Battalion in front of the Jingcheng Theater. Student Wang Shuangke was beaten on the head. The matter was initially settled with mutual apologies. The injured student was sent to the Central Hospital for treatment by the Conscript Battalion. At 8 a.m. this morning, over two hundred Lanzhou University students gathered to march and petition, shouting slogans and writing anti-Conscript Battalion slogans on the streets. The military and police did not intervene, and fortunately, no conflict occurred. The students petitioned the Military Affairs Office, demanding four conditions: (1) Replace Cao Shuxi, commander of the 22nd Conscript Battalion; (2) Execute the assailant; (3) Publish an apology in the newspaper; (4) Guarantee the safety of Lanzhou University students. The Military Affairs Office agreed to first thoroughly investigate the truth of the incident and promised to handle it fairly. Wang Shuangke is still in a coma due to severe concussion. The four Conscript soldiers involved, including Cui Delin, have been detained and handed over to the military court for investigation.

### Journey to Western Henan (1)

[Our Shanzhou Dispatch, 14th (Airmail)] Western Henan, a region historically known for its barren land, impoverished people, backward culture, inconvenient transportation, and strategically important terrain, has never been a focus of attention. However, since August 22nd of last year, when bandit chieftain Chen Geng personally led his 100,000 troops across the Yellow River from Shanzhou and occupied Western Henan in one fell swoop, the overall situation in the Central Plains was shaken. This caused people to recognize the strategic geographical value of this area, leading to a common realization: "Without Western Henan, there is no Central Plains; to defend the Central Plains, Western Henan must be secured first." In reality, however, Western Henan was sinking and deteriorating day by day, and the overall situation in the Central Plains was worsening accordingly. Anxiety clouded the brows of the people in the Central Plains, and terror filled every corner. Nevertheless, the resilient compatriots of Western Henan, awakened by the bloody lessons of the communists, rose up spontaneously, gradually clearing out the stubborn bandits, recovering their homeland, and rescuing their fathers and brothers. This slowly restored Western Henan to its original state and lessened the heavy threat to the Central Plains, marking a legendary chapter in the task of suppressing rebellion and defending oneself. The reporter had long been intrigued by the stories and wanted to visit this area to witness the devastation after the calamity and interview some of the folk heroes who rose up to suppress the bandits and save themselves. Fortunately, at the end of last month, I was specially invited by various circles in Western Henan, so I gladly accepted.

Entering Hangu Pass on Horseback

Arriving at Yuyang marked my entry into the gateway of Western Henan. My destination was to proceed from Luoyang, along Xin'an, Mianchi, Shanxian, Lingbao, to Minxiang. However, after arriving in Luoyang, I learned that the Luotong Highway had only been open to military vehicles for a few days because bandits frequently roamed north and south of Mianchi, disrupting transportation again. I considered returning to Zhengzhou to take a plane to Xi'an and then transfer east to Western Henan, but military officials said that the Luotong Highway would resume operation within days, so I waited in Luoyang for seven days. On the morning of February 8th (Lunar December 29th), I was finally loaded onto a military gas truck like smuggled goods, and set off westward.

The truck sped along, and in a little over an hour, we arrived in Xin'an County. Outside the east gate of the city, the stele of the "Ancient Hangu Pass," which had withstood the turmoil and still stood tall, appeared even more ancient and desolate than Germany and Japan. The railway tracks, like dismembered corpses, were scattered and fragmented along the railway. The roadbed was also dug up in a chaotic manner. When would it be resurrected? When my eyes met its corpse, I felt infinite lament and sorrow for this major artery connecting to the northwest.

This mountain city of Xin'an had left many footprints of mine. The city walls and houses here remained deeply imprinted in my mind. But this time, when the car carried me into Xin'an County, I no longer believed that this was the mountain city I knew. After entering the east gate, all I saw were ruins and debris. Slogans from the communists and the Nationalists stood in opposition on these broken walls. The surviving, incomplete city houses were without doors or windows, some with bricks and mud replacing them. Manure and garbage were scattered all over the streets, stray dogs roamed around, and there were few pedestrians. I felt as if I had entered a deserted graveyard, and I couldn't help but shiver, feeling a bit creeped out. The car stopped in front of the dilapidated county government office. Just as I was preparing to get out, several familiar faces appeared below the car. They grasped my hand, and I then recognized them as Guo Pinsan, the county magistrate of Xin'an, and Li Fengchun, the police chief of the county. Their arduous struggle against the communists had transformed them. Their tattered clothes and sallow faces told of their living conditions over the past half year. They had received news in advance that I was passing through there, so they were waiting specifically for me and insisted on me staying for a day. Although I did not accept their invitation because I did not want to delay the car, I stayed for two hours while the driver was eating.

County Government Like a Ruined Temple

The county government was now completely like a ruined temple. One could see straight through from the main street to the last building without any obstruction. The prosperous scene on either side of the county government gate in the past was now nowhere to be found. The Xianhualou Restaurant next door to the east of the county government had become a public toilet. The front of the county government was desolate. Standing there, I felt infinite sorrow and vicissitudes of life. There was no place to buy food here. Thanking their kindness, they bought me two cold buns. They told me that since the communists crossed the Yellow River and invaded from Kuangkou on the eighth day of last year, the county seat had fallen four times and been repeatedly contested, turning the city into a ghost town. Although it had been recovered for over a month now, the residents had either been coerced by the bandits, massacred, or fled to other places. The population in the city was now less than three-tenths of what it used to be. Although there were no precise statistics on the total public and private losses in the county, after this unprecedented catastrophe, it would be difficult for the local vitality to recover within fifty years. The area within seventy li north of the city had been deserted. The communists not only looted all the population and resources in that area but also filled in all the wells. Even if the remaining bandits within the territory could be cleared in the short term, the reconstruction work could not be completed immediately by the county alone. The local armed forces had been almost completely lost. Later, they rose up to suppress the bandits with eighteen guns and had now expanded to two thousand guns. They seemed to have strong confidence in suppressing the bandits, but they had a more pressing hope, which was to eagerly await the government to provide relief.

Xin'an to Mianchi was ninety li, which could originally be reached in two hours. However, the car broke down just north of Qianqiu, more than thirty li east of Mianchi. That place was right on the north-south corridor of the communists. The car stopped in the terrifying wilderness, and the cold wind assailed the frightened hearts of dozens of passengers. Occasionally, a cavalry patrol team of the National Army sped past, but the sound of warhorses only caused more terror, and could not give people any psychological security. In addition, the wilderness was full of weeds and rabbits. Looking around, I felt more and more frightened. Fortunately, after an hour of emergency repairs, the car finally started again. When the setting sun illuminated the flag on the same day, I and the other dozens of strangers arrived at the battered Mianchi together. The city gate was full of soldiers, and there were construction projects everywhere. The neat memorial archways and steles in the east gate were being dismantled by the army to make bunkers. The businessmen were deserted and closed their doors. The atmosphere of war still shrouded this small and poor county seat.

Entertaining the Unexpected Guest

Mianchi was the poorest county. After being occupied by bandits last year, it had turned into a hell on earth in a few months. Although the county seat had been recovered, there were still communists harassing the countryside. The people were impoverished, and nine out of ten houses were empty. Although a large army was currently stationed in the city, it could not immediately make this poor city, which was congenitally deficient and now on its last breath, prosper again. There were only a few small restaurants in the city, no businesses or hotels. In this situation, I had no choice but to stay at the county government. The county government was as dilapidated and desolate as the Xin'an County government. The houses in the backyard had been completely destroyed by the communists. The county magistrate and all the staff were squeezed into a small courtyard in the northwest corner of the front yard of the county government. A student named Wang was working as a secretary here. He was overjoyed to see me, and I almost didn't recognize him. County Magistrate Dong took me into the house, holding my hand tightly, but couldn't say a word. He was a silent, hardworking young man, a graduate of the County Normal School. He had previously worked as a district chief in Wo and had no status in the local area. However, after this occupation, he resolutely and bravely mobilized the people to rise up and suppress the bandits, gradually recovering the county. The Eleventh District Commissioner Tu considered him to have contributed to suppressing the bandits, so after the original county magistrate Ji was killed in action, he was appointed as acting county magistrate. He had now expanded from dozens of guns to more than a thousand guns. He was extremely excited by the unexpected arrival of this unexpected guest. He immediately ordered food to be prepared to welcome the guest and gave up his own bed for me to sleep in. We talked about the local occupation, the communists' shootings and looting, and then about self-defense against bandits and the reconstruction situation. He said that after Mianchi was occupied, the local armed forces were completely lost, and no fewer than five hundred people were killed, with public and private losses exceeding two trillion. Currently, more than seven thousand communists were still gathered in the northeast township. The local militia were cooperating with the National Army to suppress them. The local people were impoverished and eagerly awaiting relief. Otherwise, during the spring famine, I don't know how many people would starve to death. We talked around the stove until it was already eight o'clock. I was hungry and tired, but the food hadn't arrived, and I didn't want to say anything. County Magistrate Dong seemed to be urging for the food as well. It wasn't until half-past eight that the food was finally brought in. It was four dishes and a soup. I started eating without delay, but before I could finish a bowl of rice, I suddenly heard a group of people rushing in from outside, shouting and cursing County Magistrate Dong's name, as if they were about to rush into the house and stab County Magistrate Dong "with a white knife in and a red knife out." I was shocked. County Magistrate Dong was also stunned. No one knew who they were or what it was about. A Deputy Commander Liang quickly took two brothers out to see what was going on. Inside the house, we only heard the people in the yard arguing and cursing: "County Magistrate Dong, if you have the guts, come out. See if I dare to do what you don't dare. Damn it, you did this to embarrass us. Go ask our company commanders if we are easy to mess with. Even if you are entertaining the heavenly king, you have to ask who is sitting here ten li away. If you don't explain the reason today, I will fight to the death!" The person blocking them quickly apologized: "The county magistrate is not at home. The people below are ignorant. Please forgive us!" The other party cursed again: "If your county magistrate isn't here, quickly hand over the person who just went to the restaurant, or we will never give up." Hearing this situation, I was truly restless, but there was no way to go out and defuse the situation. County Magistrate Dong, who was being humiliated for my sake, was trembling and trembling. The atmosphere in the yard was filled with tension, and the voices were boiling. Seeing that this farce, which was caused by me, was about to break out, I thought that it was not surprising that I, a reporter, would be beaten, or even taken away to suffer even more unimaginable torture, but what kind of thing was it for a county magistrate appointed by the government to be beaten and humiliated?

### A Plea for Education

— Mo Zhongyi

Recently, many people have been scolding education, complaining about education, hating education, and mocking education, saying that education is bankrupt, that education has taken the wrong path, that education harms people, and that education misleads the country. All the bad phenomena in the country and society are attributed to education itself, as if education should bear the entire responsibility for the country and society. Those who scold education do so based on two mentalities. One is that they have too much expectation for education, thinking that education is omnipotent and that if education is well-run, everything will be solved. The other is that they disregard education, look down on education, and think that education is only a tool of politics, at the mercy of politicians and subject to exploitation. Both of these mentalities are extreme. Those who work in education are under attack from both sides, so they are attacked, scolded, ridiculed, and mocked! We, who work in the education field, are not well-fed or well-clothed, and we worry about firewood, rice, oil, and salt all day long. We teach other people's children, but our own children have nowhere to study. This is already disheartening, and what's more, we can't even get the understanding of people in society, and we are subjected to insults. How can we not cry out in grievance!

Such Insults to Those Who Eat Chalk Dust

There are too many people who scold education. We often see those irresponsible words in newspapers and magazines. We ask ourselves, education is indeed not well-run. However, what things in China are well-run? Looking at the statistics, objectively analyzing, the education sector in China is not worse than any other sector? There are no achievements? We ask ourselves, what are the achievements in politics, economy, or society in China? We who work in the education sector dare not exaggerate, and we cannot exaggerate what great contributions we have made to education; we also do not forgive ourselves, do not rest on our laurels, we should admit that we have not fulfilled the greatest responsibility for education. We must blame ourselves, we must strive for progress. However, looking around our China, which sector has shouldered the great task it should shoulder? In which corner is there something that is in line with our ideals, beyond reproach? Why do people scold education, scold education more, and not scold others? Such insults to those who eat chalk dust, sell their words, are pale and thin, and have no weapons, we may not be discouraged, but we must cry out in grievance!

Recently, the Ta Kung Pao published two articles on February 20, 21, and 23 of this year, one was written by Mr. Zhang Tianlu, "I Accuse Educators Across the Country," published for two consecutive days, a long article; the other was written by Mr. Gu Zhengqian, "Such Education Should Be Accused," is a supplement to Mr. Zhang Tianlu's "Accusation" to make up for shortcomings. After reading them, we feel that education has been scolded twice again, from the intuition seems that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Gu are right to scold, but after thinking about it in the clear night, we can't help but cry out for education!

Mr. Zhang, based on his personal experience, pointed out the harm of the education he received from elementary school to university graduation, and therefore accused educators across the country of four points: First, "The entrance exams at all levels cannot really shoulder the mission of selecting qualified young people, on the contrary, it has become a bad system that destroys the body and mind of young people and oppresses the education of schools at a lower level." Second, "Education is not a decoration and patent of the rich, everyone has equal access to education, this is the minimum condition for a democratic country, as for the treatment of normal school students, it cannot be regarded as the same role as the public funding of ordinary students." Third, "Traditional education hinders the development of social life, requiring the improvement of traditional education to suit the needs of public life, further for the sake of improving society." Fourth, "Traditional education focuses solely on the training of books and words, stifling the individuality of young people and cultivating a group of bookworms with academic qualifications." Finally, it concludes: "In recent years, life has been difficult, I still have public funding to eat in university, maybe the family is starving and I don't know. More than ten years of national education, more than ten years of family expectations, more than ten years of suffering myself, when I am about to graduate from university, looking forward to the future, it is a piece of darkness, I am sad for my future, I feel even more unreasonable and unsound of traditional education, so based on actual experience I wrote out the persecution of traditional education I received, to serve as a reference for educators across the country."

Seeing the Problems of Education but Having to Accuse

Mr. Zhang's article points out that all levels of schools are preparing for entrance exams; "Elementary school is to prepare for entering middle school, the lessons taught in middle school are to prepare for entering university, and what about university? ... It is still aimed at you taking the exam to study abroad," "They are all dependent on the upper level, there is no independent personality of its own at all," and then criticizes the unreasonableness of the exam system, the inappropriateness of reciting "Entrance Examination Guide," "Applying for Zhe Nan," "Comprehensive Examination Guide," "Comprehensive Examination Essentials," and finally concludes that education is too far from real life, resulting in stepping out of the school gate, it is "perfunctory," "mixing rice," "feeling the pain of finding a job," and therefore said: "Really, our current school education, in addition to serving the rich to enter higher education, other is simply useless."

Mr. Zhang and Mr. Gu have seen the problems of education, but all these problems should be attributed to education itself, which is really too wronged, we have to cry out for education, and have to make a defense.

Let us first defend Mr. Zhang's accusation. First, the entrance exams at all levels cannot shoulder the mission of selecting qualified young people, this statement only said half of it, not all of it, all countries in the world have more universities than middle schools, and more middle schools than elementary schools, China cannot be an exception. In the majority to choose the minority, there are only two ways, one is to hold entrance exams, the other is to be recommended by schools at a lower level, if only based on volunteers can enter higher education, not only can China not do it now, but even all countries in the world cannot do it. Recommendation has shortcomings, because the level of schools across the country is uneven, some schools with the best students, compared with other schools may be mediocre, people who handle school administration, especially people who handle educational administration, can know, so it is difficult to set an objective standard for recommended students. Holding entrance exams does have the problems pointed out by Mr. Zhang, but before a better way to select students is devised, entrance exams are still a more appropriate way. At present, schools recruit new students, and winter recruitment and recommendation are used together. According to the statistics of our school, the performance of the enrolled new students in the school is always better than that of the recommended students, and when we ask other schools, there are many of the same phenomena. The exam system has not been perfect, people who run education have the feeling of Canghai Yizhu, but those who "luck" are a minority after all, if it is said that the majority of good students can not enter higher education because there are entrance exams, and the majority of bad students have "luck" because there are entrance exams, then entrance exams can no longer be used. But what objective facts can prove it? Before a more perfect method of selecting students is invented, there is nothing wrong with combining entrance exams and recommendation system. As for how to improve the entrance exams, so that it can better shoulder the mission of selecting qualified young people, without destroying the body and mind of young people, without oppressing schools at a lower level, that is exactly the effort that the education sector should make.

### Rice Market Arrivals Still Weak, Spot Prices Gradually Falling, Flour, Cooking Oil, Grains, and Rice Prices Decline

[Our Report] Yesterday, rice market arrivals remained weak, with only 1,414 shi. Normal trading within the market remained stagnant. In order to maintain food supplies for the people, the authorities further increased the amount of rice released, yesterday releasing a total of 13,655 shi of Wuhu machine-milled indica rice, distributed to 2,218 rice shops. Spot prices have gradually stabilized as the authorities have taken emergency measures to deal with the city's price problems, coupled with Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing, which has calmed people's hearts. Moreover, the continuous surge in prices had reached its peak, and some owners, having achieved their desire for 3 million, were not hesitant to sell. Importers were also wary of these high prices and dared not purchase rashly. Therefore, yesterday's spot market trading saw all rice retreat below the 3 million mark. White japonica rice was at 2.9 million, thin indica rice at 2.85 million, and early rice retreated to 2.8 million, each falling by as much as 150,000.

Flour

Due to the decline in the rice market, efforts to revive it were weak. As soon as trading opened, strong selling pressure was evident, with retail investors selling one after another. Although wheat prices rose to 2 million, it was no longer enough to stimulate further increases. Yesterday's prices were already within limits, so spot trading changed to open trading in the market. Old Che brand flour retreated below the 1.4 million mark as soon as trading opened, falling as low as 1.38 million before closing at 1.39 million. Warship brand closed at 1.37 million, while Red Bee and Jiancheng brands were each down by 50,000 to 60,000 compared to the previous day, and bran was down by 30,000.

Cooking Oil

A complete rout, with raw soybean oil and various other cooking oils all plummeting rapidly. This was because the continuous increases in recent days had been too great. Now that the rice market had collapsed, it was inevitably affected. Importers held back, and owners competed to sell. Oil factories also made sales, resulting in a chorus of "sell" voices. Factory soybean oil opened at 6.3 million, then 6.2 million (with plenty left). Dachang's new soybean oil was even lower at 6.15 million, and the lowest was Tongfeng's soybean oil at 6.1 million, a sharp drop of 600,000 to 700,000 compared to the previous day. Qingdao Jitung's raw oil fell to the 7 million mark, closing at 7.05 million, a reduction of 450,000. Raw rapeseed oil and the like all fell by 600,000 to 700,000, small cart sesame oil fell slightly by 500,000 to 600,000, and soybean cakes also saw a sharp drop, falling by 70,000 to 80,000.

Grains

A general decline across the board. Hankou Zha beans opened in the morning, already falling to 1.6 million, down 150,000, and later falling to 1.55 million, a sharp drop of more than 10%. Sesame and mung beans followed, falling by 100,000. Raw peanuts arrived in large quantities, and Guangdong merchants did not come to pick them up, making the market sluggish and unable to recover. Nanjing raw peanuts opened at 3.4 million, a drop of as much as 500,000. Hand-picked green beans recovered slightly by 50,000. Only high-grade corn was in demand. Qidong corn opened at 2.2 million, an increase of 200,000, due to the Haizhou merchants actively exchanging for salt, making continuous efforts, and the market was not easy to decline. Corn from the central regions had already risen sharply in recent days, and yesterday's market price was no different.

### Foreign Rice and Coal Shipments to Shanghai

[Our Report] The American President Lines' President Taft arrived from San Francisco with 55,500 bags of American rice.

Additionally, the Nanqiang, carrying 6,700 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, was also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and is expected to berth at Kailuan Pier for unloading.

The China Merchants Bureau's Hongzhang is scheduled to load 14,000 bags of relief flour from the Storage Department today for transport to Tianjin.

### Sugar Prices Fall

Sugar prices, which had been soaring in recent days, rising step by step, began to fall yesterday. The guild's quotation for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar fell by 250,000 to 350,000. No. 45 semi-white fell by 400,000 to 450,000. No. 20 medium granulated white saw a similar decrease. Other domestic sugars only had asking prices and no transactions were heard. However, according to Shantou telegrams, production prices are tight, and calculated costs are higher than Shanghai's market prices. Among sugar prices, green sugar is relatively stable and is not expected to decrease significantly in the short term. There are still many transactions in warehouse warrants, with prices fluctuating by 600,000 to 700,000. As a result, August contracts decreased by more than 400,000, and September contracts decreased by 380,000.

### Tea Market Weakens

The tea market opened yesterday morning with continued enthusiasm due to price cuts by major sellers, revealing a sharp trend. However, due to widespread declines in other commodities, people's confidence also waned slightly. Until the close, apart from certain varieties that still managed to increase, the rest generally hovered around the same level. Domestic tea was like a fish in water, with buyers feeling that sales in the local area and in Suzhou and Wuxi were continuous. Activity remained enthusiastic. As for export tea, exporters found prices strangely high and were generally hesitant, and the situation remained calm as before.

### Firewood and Charcoal Prices Rise

Yesterday, the firewood and charcoal market saw a sharp increase in demand as the price of kerosene continued to rise, and citizens mostly switched to using firewood and charcoal for fuel, resulting in brisk sales at the shops. At the opening, due to scarce arrivals and inventories, asking prices were unusually high. Chestnut firewood sold for 175,000 per dan, pine firewood for 145,000, green charcoal rose to 580,000 per dan, white charcoal to 510,000, and black charcoal to 440,000, a rise of about 15%.

### Timber Prices Soar

In the timber market, due to the rise in foreign exchange and other commodities, opening prices also soared. Furthermore, due to purchases by construction firms and good retail sales, the market continued to increase. Five-fen pine planks rose to 1 million per zhang, one-zhang building planks sold for 750,000, four-fen red star pine planks for 550,000, foreign pine rose to 50,000 per foot, and fir wood to 12,000 to 13,000 per foot. Compared to the previous week, fir wood had almost doubled, foreign pine had increased by as much as 60%, and other goods had risen by 10% to 20%.

### Panic Selling Occurs Frequently, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Gradually Decline, 42-Count Fine Yarn Down 10 Million Compared to Previous Day

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a decline in confidence due to the authorities' handling of cotton inventory registration and prohibition of movement. Adding to this was the opening of sales by the Textile Construction Company, leading to frequent panic selling. The market had risen sharply for several days, and prices had reached their peak, causing all parties to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Retail investors and market participants took the opportunity to sell at higher prices, and all levels of prices declined across the board. Eventually, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn closed at 120 million, a sharp drop of 10 million compared to the previous day. The remaining counts of coarse and fine yarn also declined uniformly, ranging from 300,000 to 3.45 million.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with a decline, and rumors circulated that the authorities would take strict measures against the current chaotic situation in various markets, thoroughly investigate all illegal trading activities, prohibit free trading of cotton, and restrict movement. The public panicked, and long positions competed to sell. Selling pressure unfolded in the market, and prices gradually declined. Eventually, 12-pound Dragon Head and other grades of fine cloth fell by 40,000 to 80,000 compared to the previous day. In addition, serge, direct tribute bleached cloth, and other prices also followed suit and declined. However, colored cloth and Shilin cloth remained strong due to firm factory prices, and the market remained lively.

[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company opened yarn sales as usual yesterday. The company offered 1,759 pieces, equivalent to 3,011 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a total of 598 purchase applications. The Yarn Control Committee offered 378 pieces, equivalent to about 600 pieces of 20-count yarn, with 107 purchase applications.

The opening prices for each count of yarn were: 20-count Golden Double Chicken at 64 million, 6-count Deputy Sunlight at 35 million, 10-count Standing Horse at 39 million, 32-count Yanghe at 85 million, 40-count Baoguang at 95 million, 42-count Baoguang at 105 million, and 60-count Sunlight at 190 million.

### Cotton Trade Halt Free Purchase

The cotton industry in this city, starting yesterday, has followed orders to halt free purchase and sale, hence yesterday Lingbao cotton, Shashi cotton, Hankou fine cotton, Tongzhou fine cotton, and other domestic cottons were without trade, there were no black market transactions found throughout the day. However, cotton merchants and others have expressed extreme dissatisfaction with this move by the Flower Control Committee. They have also expressed to all sectors that the authorities' prohibition of free cotton trading is tantamount to causing all employees in the industry to be unemployed.

Furthermore, the Flower Yarn Cloth Management Committee's thorough investigation of cotton storage in various warehouses is scheduled to begin today. At the same time, the customs office is notified that all newly imported cotton will also be registered.

### Woolen Fabric Continues to Soar

### Last Year's Raw Silk Exports, India Ranked First

According to statistics from the China Trust Bureau, India was the top destination for raw silk exports last year, followed by Burma, the United Kingdom ranked third, and the United States ranked fourth. Among the export quantities, the United States had 1,350 dan, but 1,200 of these were consignment sales. As of now, the total export volume is 4,123 dan, and domestic sales are 1,525 dan, for a total of 5,648 dan. Silk fabric exports have been limited since India banned imports, although other countries can still trade, but the numbers are small, so the future is bleak. The Silk Fabric Export Association, which was responsible for assisting in promotion, has been ordered to close, but raw silk sales to India have increased, as India is now focusing on importing raw materials and weaving silk fabrics themselves.

In the morning, except for Jinglun, which still opened high, and Guohuo, which was slightly stronger, the remaining stocks all opened lower due to the Chairman's return to Nanjing.

No. 71 and others sold immediately, and the closing price outside the market opened high at 2 jiao 4 and 2 jiao 8 and a half, retreating to 1,067 yuan and 1,092 yuan. No. 188 and others bought one after the other for immediate delivery, No. 52 advance was delivered later, and rebounded to 1,115 yuan and 1,132 yuan. The crackdown outside the market was even tighter, and there was news that Hengshu was about to stop wash trading. Near noon, the trend was still up and down, and the market outside the exchange even crashed earlier. Yong Yarn closed at noon, retreating to 1,060 yuan and 1,100 yuan. The current advance is further away. Except for Jinglun Guohuo, which is supported by actual backing and still stands at a high level, the rest are also declining. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jinglun rose to the limit, Guohuo rose by 50%, China Silk and Datong rose slightly, Meyer rose by 50%, Yong Yarn, China France, Xinyi, Huafeng Matches, Xinguang, Lian'an, Jingfu, Qinxing, Business, Xinhua, China Cement, and Tongyi all fell by 50% to 10%, and the rest were slightly lower. Meyer's advance stock rose by 50%, Yong Yarn and Xinguang Jingfu fell slightly, and the rest fell by 50%.

In the aftermarket, Yong Yarn started at 1,070 yuan and 1,095 yuan, No. 220 and others came out for immediate delivery, No. 78 came out for deferred delivery, falling to low prices of 1,048 yuan and 1,065 yuan. Trading outside the market has already stopped new trades, and afterwards, the market situation is entirely under the squeeze of long and short positions, fluctuating up and down, and there is almost a squeeze on short positions. No. 218 and others advanced for immediate delivery, No. 36 advanced for current and deferred delivery, No. 8 and others advanced for deferred delivery, although state-owned banks had some advances, Guohuo Jinglun rose to the limit, Meyer, Yongye, and Lianhua also hung at the limit, and Yong Yarn rebounded to high prices of 1,135 yuan and 1,145 yuan, but then the squeeze also began, No. 12 showed up for deferred delivery, No. 183 and others settled for immediate delivery, No. 71 and others sold off for deferred delivery, and Yong Yarn closed down to 1,090 yuan and 1,108 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Jinglun Lianhua and Yongye rose to the limit, Meyer Match and China Silk rose by 50%, Yongping was flat, Tongyi fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly. Meyer's advance stock rose another 50%, Huafeng fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly. Among the unlisted stocks outside the market, cultural stocks and bank stocks rose by another 10%, which was the most popular, while the rest were still mediocre.

### Government Bonds Continue to Rise, Foreign Stocks Decline

Government bonds continued to rise yesterday. Tong Bing opened at 92,000 in the morning, rising from 88,000 to a high price of 103,000, and then retreated slightly. Dachengxing Rooms 503 and 500 both advanced, and Rooms 555, 552, and 550 bought, with a turnover of about 6 million. Compared to the previous close, A, B, and C bonds each rose by 10,000, D bonds rose by 10,000, and E bonds rose by 8,000.

### Domestic Medicine Production Prices Rise

The domestic medicine market situation, sales of various stomach medications were flat, and Sichuan products reported price increases via telegraph, and in addition, shipping costs and surcharges were extremely high, Shanghai inventory was scarce, and the aftermarket is expected to rise. Due to the rising exchange rate, foreign goods from Guangdong were not sold by Hakka. Yesterday's Hong Kong telegram was Guangdong Pi at 33 million, Buddha's Hand Slices at 32 million, Qingjia Slices at 12 million, and Fangji at 3.6 million.

### Tea Export Industry Association Telegrammed Opinions on This Year's Tea Loan, Please Lend in Three Installments According to Last Year's Case

Tea is an important export commodity, and the government has been doing its best to support the industry in recent years. The current year is also under planning. The Tea Export Industry Association, feeling pressed by the tea season, had previously submitted a telegraphic request to the Joint Treasury on the 20th of this month, asking for a quick decision on the tea loan plan. The association has now telegraphed the Joint Treasury again, stating its loan opinions:

The association believes that this year's domestic tea quantity, excluding Taiwan, is estimated to be more than 240,000 dan in various regions. According to the usual practice in each region, the harvesting and production of tea is always converted according to rice prices, with each dan of raw tea being approximately equal to three dan of rice. Temporarily calculated as two and a half dan, plus refining, packaging, and requisitions, etc., it is approximately equal to one and a half dan of rice. In total, the average cost of each dan of boxed tea from various regions to Shanghai requires the equivalent of six dan of rice. In order to increase the production of export goods and subsidize foreign exchange income, the association specifically offers four points of opinion on this year's tea goods based on the consensus of the industry.

(1) For this year's harvesting and production of export boxed tea, except for tea factory equipment, all are the responsibility of tea merchants and are not included in the cost calculation. The tea production cost is calculated according to the above-mentioned total cost. Please handle it in accordance with the silk loan method, with tea merchants funding 10% and government loans 90%.

(2) The government loan portion should be handled in accordance with the 36th year case, and lent in three installments. The first installment is for raw tea processing loans, accounting for 50% of the total cost, with a deadline of one month for refining. The second installment loan accounts for 20% of the total cost, and the third installment loan accounts for 20% of the total cost.

(3) The term of the mortgage loan is set at three months. If the market stagnates or exports cannot be met, please extend it for two months. Upon expiration, please consider the actual difficulties of the tea merchants and purchase them, and protect the legitimate profits that the tea merchants should receive.

(4) The interest on the boxed tea mortgage should be calculated according to the 36th year method, and the tea merchant's industry guarantee should be approved.

The estimated production scenery of tea in various regions this year is 241,000 dan. Qihong 20,000 dan, Tunlv 30,000 dan, Pinglv 70,000 dan, Wenhong 7,000 dan, Wenlv 8,000 dan, Minhong 25,000 dan, Minlv 15,000 dan, Xianghong 20,000 dan, Ehong 5,000 dan, Ninghong 10,000 dan, Wu (Yuan) 15,000 dan, He (Kou) Hong 3,000 dan, Yulv 5,000 dan, and Suilv 8,000 dan.

### Cotton Yarn Allocation Prices Expected to Improve, Centralized Quotations Simplify Procedures

Since the Textile Construction Company changed the price negotiation for cotton yarn allocation to quotation the day before yesterday, and the verified prices have soared, the textile industry has complained. A responsible person had discussed with Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee and General Vice Manager Shu Wu of the Textile Construction Company, and they all agreed that the lack of flexibility in the original price negotiation was necessary to improve. Regarding the recent quotation method, each factory submits a quotation for bidding, but the allocation price is determined separately by the Textile Construction Company, so purchasers cannot know the yarn price in advance, quoters are worried about gains and losses, and accountants cannot be detailed. There is no market for pricing, and the allocation price is like revealing a mystery, the procedures are confusing, and people are stimulated, and the textile industry believes that it must be further improved. Chairman Yuan said that quotations do not have to be submitted by each household separately. If each industry can appoint a responsible representative to handle the quotation with the Textile Construction Company, they can negotiate the allocation price with the yarn allocation agency. Simplifying procedures is also feasible. The Textile Construction authorities are still considering this. However, it has stated that it will strive to rationalize allocation prices and increase allocation volumes. Yesterday (the 27th), the machine dyeing and weaving industry formally presented a report to the Yarn Control Committee, suggesting improvements to the current quotation method.

### The Rebirth and Support of Taiwan Coal

Talking about the rebirth and support of Taiwan coal, the first thing to mention is the domestic coal supply and demand problem. Originally, the coal used in major cities along the southeast coast of our country relied on the supply from major mines in the north. Since the communists have stepped up their disturbances in the north, the output of various mines has been reduced sharply, or has fallen into stagnation, or transportation has been blocked, resulting in a serious coal shortage in various places such as Beijing, Shanghai, and South China. Therefore, the status of Taiwan coal in the domestic market is becoming more and more important, and the expectation of various parties for the increased production of Taiwan coal is gradually increasing.

A Heavy Responsibility and A Long Way to Go

The supply of Taiwan coal is currently shouldering a task that is both heavy and far-reaching. Every employee engaged in the coal mining industry is calmly working hard for this difficult task. Its supply range can be divided into two parts: domestic sales and foreign sales. The main users in the province are railways and various publicly-owned industries. The largest demand comes from the sugar, paper, cement, machinery, kiln, textile, tobacco and alcohol, and camphor industries. All areas outside the province are under the unified control of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Qingdao. In terms of domestic sales, there has been a significant increase due to the accelerated recovery of industry in the province. For example, in the sugar industry, sugar production last year was only more than 30,000 tons, but this year it has increased sharply to more than 300,000 tons. The coal used for sugar production this period will require more than 100,000 tons. The current is in the sugar production season, and the coal quota for the sugar industry alone is 30,000 tons per month. The sharp increase in coal demand in the sugar industry has another reason besides the increase in sugar production. In the past, sugar factories used bagasse as boiler fuel, but now the pulp manufacturing part of the Zihui Paper Company has resumed operation, and this bagasse can be used in large quantities as a raw material for manufacturing pulp, solving the current raw material needs. Therefore, the fuel originally borne by bagasse must also be replenished by coal. In terms of the cement industry, last year's output was only more than 12,000 tons per month, but now it has reached 20,000 tons per month, and the amount of coal used has also increased from 5,000 to 6,000 tons per month to more than 10,000 tons. The amount of coal used by various other industries and transportation has also gradually increased. The monthly quota for domestic coal sales has increased from more than 100,000 tons three months ago to the current 105,000 tons, and will continue to increase with the long-term progress of industrial recovery. Although this is an excellent phenomenon in the industrial sector, the coal mining industry feels increasingly burdened. Regarding the amount of coal for foreign sales, Taiwan has always tried its best to supply it. In the entire year of the 36th year, a total of 431,875 tons were exported. After consultation between Taiwan Province and the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a measurement was made based on the needs of the province and abroad. It should first be supplied to the province and then to other provinces, because the province uses coal to increase production. As a result, it is temporarily set at 40,000 tons per month for export. According to officials in Taiwan Province: They are extremely concerned about the urgent need for coal in Beijing and Shanghai. In the future, in addition to supplying the necessary quantity in the province, they will try their best to transport it out, hoping to exceed the currently temporarily set number of 40,000 tons per month.

Highest Production

Under such a heavy burden, will the output of coal production be able to cope with it happily? According to past circumstances, before 1937 during the Japanese occupation, the annual output of Taiwan coal averaged between 1.5 million and 1.8 million metric tons, which is between 120,000 and 150,000 tons per month. At that time, there was no worry about the lack of materials, transportation was smooth, and profits were stable. All kinds of conditions were much better than they are now, and the prosperity of coal production was an inevitable result. By the end of the war, the Japanese actively increased production, reaching an annual output of 2.8 million tons in 1941. However, this was destructive production. In order to seek temporary relief, the Japanese even mined the coal pillars, which caused the current difficulty in lowering coal. From 1942 to around the time of restoration, coal production has fallen year by year to more than 30,000 tons per month. After the government's continuous efforts, in the 35th year of the Republic of China, more than 1,005,500 tons were produced, and in the 36th year it increased again to more than 1.3 million tons, averaging 110,000 tons per month. Although current production conditions are so poor, it has reached 70% of the output during the Japanese occupation. This year's production plan is 2 million metric tons for the whole year. In January, it has increased sharply to 145,000 tons, creating the highest record since the restoration. If there are no unexpected difficulties, it is not difficult to achieve the highest ideal, and the amount of coal for foreign sales may exceed the fixed amount of 40,000 tons per month.

Literary History

### The History of Collating the *Shui Jing Zhu* Can Illustrate the Methods of Textual Criticism

— Hu Shi

More than ten years ago, when I wrote the preface to Mr. Chen Yuan's "Annotations and Supplements to Yuan Dian Zhang," I broadly discussed the methods of textual criticism. I said, "Using a good version for collation is the soul of textual criticism and the only way to achieve it. ... For missing text, misplaced slips, inverted pages, unseen personal or place names, or unseen ancient or vulgar characters, there is no way to guess without collation."

"The most refined reasoning (such as that of Wang Niansun and Duan Yucai) can often compensate for the deficiencies of versions. The true meaning of textual criticism lies in mutual comparison of copies. Although the search for copies is opened and great effort is spent on careful analysis, this is ultimately not the proper path of textual criticism."

This article (collected in the first volume of Hu Shi's Recent Academic Works, pages 135 to 148) caused quite a bit of protest at the time because criticizing Wang Niansun and Duan Yucai, saying that they were not on the right path of textual criticism, was not easily acceptable to orthodox scholars. However, the method of textual criticism I spoke of is actually the method recognized by all textual critics. For example, Mr. Chen Yuan collated the *Yuan Dian Zhang* and supplemented more than 102 missing pages. Can reasoning-based textual criticism supplement even half a missing page?

I will now use the history of scholars in the Ming and Qing dynasties revising the *Shui Jing Zhu* to illustrate that good versions for collation are indeed the soul of textual criticism.

The *Shui Jing Zhu* engraved by Huang Shengzeng (Jiajing 12th year, 1534 AD) has ten major defects:

(1) No preface by Li Daoyuan

(2) Volume 1 has one misplaced slip

(3) Volume 2 has one misplaced slip

(4) Volumes 9 and 13 each have two mutually misplaced slips

(5) Volume 22, the Ying River section, has one misplaced slip

(6) Volume 22, the Qu River section, has one misplaced slip

(7) Volume 30 has one misplaced slip

(8) Volume 18 is missing the second slip

(9) Volume 18 is missing the last slip of eighty-five characters at the end.

(10) Volume 31 is missing one slip, misplaced in Volume 33, the Yangtze River section.

These ten major defects were not corrected by Wu Guan's collated and engraved version (Wanli 13th year, 1585), because he had not seen any other good versions for comparison.

Zhu Mouwei (Wanli 43rd year, 1615) used Xie Zhaoshen's "Song Version" (presumably a hand-copied Song version) and corrected six of the ten defects:

The misplaced slip in Volume 1.

The misplaced slip in Volume 2.

The misplaced slips in Volumes 9 and 13.

The misplaced slip in Volume 30.

The last slip of five lines in Volume 18

The missing slip in Volume 31

Zhu Mouwei attempted to collate and correct the misplaced slip in Volume 22, the Ying River section, but no matter how he revised it, it was still wrong and unreadable. He did not even notice the misplaced slip in the Qu River section.

By the ninth year of Qianlong (1744), Quan Zuwang and Zhao Yiqing borrowed Sun Qian's collated version from the Ma family of Yangzhou. Sun Qian used Liu Qian's hand-copied Song version to collate Zhu Mouwei's version. Liu Qian's Song version had four major advantages over Xie Zhaoshen's Song version:

(1) It had two-thirds of Li Daoyuan's preface, missing only half a slip.

(2) The Ying River section did not have a misplaced slip.

(3) The Ying River section did not have a misplaced slip.

(4) Volume 18 had the second slip. Quan and Zhao used Sun Qian's copy of Liu Qian's version to collate the *Shui Jing Zhu*, and thus three and two-thirds of the four major defects left by Zhu Mouwei were unexpectedly supplemented, leaving only one-third of Li's preface missing.

In the thirtieth year of Qianlong (1765), Dai Zhen had not yet seen the *Yongle Encyclopedia* version, but he also wanted to collate and correct the defects left by Zhu Mouwei. He wanted to correct the misplaced slip in the Ying River section and also wanted to correct the missing text in Volume 18 (Wei River section). He did not know that the Ying River section was missing an entire slip, nor did he know that the Wei River section was missing an entire slip. The results of his corrections are preserved in the "Attached Examinations" in his self-collated *Shui Jing* one-volume edition (one copy in the Peking University Library and another in the Zhou family collection of Jiande). In both of these places, his correction work failed because he had not seen a copy that was older and more complete than those of Huang Shengzeng and Xie Zhaoshen. Zhen also did not know that the Qu River section was missing an entire slip!

In the thirty-eighth year of Qianlong (1773), Dai Zhen saw the *Shui Jing Zhu* in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* at the Siku Library. This version was more complete than those of Huang and Xie and even more complete than Liu Qian's version. The four major advantages of Liu Qian's version were all present in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* version. The Guan's preface to Liu Qian's version was missing a full half-slip, but this preface was completely intact in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* version. Therefore, between the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth years of Qianlong, Dai Zhen completely corrected all ten major defects of Huang Shengzeng's version.

For all such major defects, without ancient versions available for comparison, even with exceptional intelligence and extraordinary effort, satisfactory collation cannot be achieved. Zhu Mouwei's and Dai Zhen's collation of the misplaced slips in the Ying River, and Dai Zhen's supplement to the missing slip in the Wei River, are all the most beneficial lessons in textual criticism.

From the engraving of Huang Shengzeng's version to the collation of the *Shui Jing Zhu* in the *Yongle Encyclopedia*, a full two hundred and forty years passed. Of the ten major defects left by Huang's engraved version, Zhu Mouwei corrected six, Quan Zuwang and Zhao Yiqing corrected nine and two-thirds, and Dai Zhen corrected all ten. These are all the achievements of collating with good versions. (37, 2, 18 midnight)

### Pure Talk and Pure Criticism

— Tang Changru

According to the general interpretation, "pure talk" is a kind of abstract and profound discussion, while "pure criticism" is practical criticism of individuals. The connotations of the two seem to be inconsistent. However, according to the statements of people in the late Han and Three Kingdoms periods, the so-called "pure talk" at that time, before the emergence of metaphysics, was not strictly different from "pure criticism." In other words, it was practical criticism of individuals. The *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, Volume 1, Note to the *Biography of Emperor Wu*, quotes Zhang Fan's *Han Ji* and Zheng Tai's account of Dong Zhuo (same as Fan Ye's *Book of the Later Han*, Volume 100, *Biography of Zheng Tai*):

"Kong Gongxu is capable of pure talk and lofty discussions, breathing life into the withered and blowing life away."

Also, Volume 7, Note to the *Biography of Zang Hong*, quotes *Spring and Autumn of the Nine Provinces* on Jiao He:

"In private, one sees his pure talk reaching the clouds, but in public, he is chaotic, and his fate is unknowable." (Similar to Yuan Hong's *Book of the Later Han*, Volume 26)

These two entries are the earliest to use the term "pure talk." We do not know the content of Jiao He's pure talk, but Kong Zhong's talk had the effect of "breathing life into the withered and blowing life away." Li Xian's commentary to the *Biography of Zheng Tai* in the *Book of the Later Han* states:

"Breathing on the withered to make it live, and blowing on the living to make it wither, means that the talk and discussion has its own emphases and suppressions."

Discussions with emphases and suppressions are also criticisms of people (or affairs). Later generations have not completely lost the original meaning of the "blowing and breathing" idiom, but have only emphasized the "praising" aspect. *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, Volume 13, Note to the *Biography of Zhong Yu*:

"Sun Quan submitted as a vassal and sent the head of Guan Yu. When the Crown Prince wrote to Ji, Ji replied: 'Your servant's fellow district man, former Secretary Gou Shuang, said:

People should follow their emotions. Those who love me, how lovable they are; those who hate me, how hateful they are. Thinking of Sun Quan, I find him even more charming.' The Crown Prince wrote again: 'I am pleased to know that the South has submitted. As for Master Xun's pure talk and Sun Quan's charm, I hold the letter, panting and gasping, unable to let it go. If Quan becomes black again, I will break him with Xu Shao's monthly criticism of Runan. Quan's leisurely dealings with the two kingdoms, bowing to Xun and Xu, is enough.'"

Cao Pi considered Xun Shuang's words to be "pure talk," naturally unrelated to the later emerging metaphysics. Xu Shao's monthly criticism of Runan was a famous criticism of individuals, and by mentioning it together, it can be seen that there was some connection. I think Zhong Yu and Cao Pi meant to say that there are two kinds of critical attitudes: Xun Shuang's is subjective, using love and hate as the standard, while Xu Shao's is objective, using actions as the standard. If love and hate are used as the standard, then Sun Quan is charming; if actions are used as the standard, then the evaluation of Sun Quan must change at any time. Therefore, although Xun Shuang's words were not a concrete criticism of a person, they were related to it. As to whether Xun Shuang said this intentionally or as a jest is another matter.

There are two more examples of "pure talk" being used interchangeably with "pure criticism" in the *Book of Jin*. *Book of Jin*, Volume 44, *Zheng Mao with appended sons Mo and Fu*:

"Initially, the Emperor (Emperor Wu of Jin) wanted to select a nobleman for an official position. No one in the village dared to serve in the military. He sought one within the state. Therefore, the impartial administrators of twelve districts all recommended Mo. When Emperor Wu went to worship in the southern suburbs, he ordered Mo to ride alongside him and said to Mo, '...In the past, the state selected you as a minister. I am always ashamed to burden pure talk." *Ibid*, Volume 45, *Biography of Liu Yi*, Sun Yin's memorial recommending Yi as the impartial administrator of Ru'nan states:

"In this state, only Yi is outstanding in virtue. If Yi is not employed, then pure criticism will be overturned."

Although the *Book of Jin* was revised by Tang Dynasty people, the first entry appears in the *Classified Collection of Literary Works*, Volume 48, quoting Wang Yin's *Book of Jin*. The second entry is a memorial, which historians rarely change when abridging. Therefore, both can be believed to be statements from the Jin Dynasty. The "pure talk" in these two entries is actually "pure criticism." The second entry makes it even clearer. The duty of the impartial administrator was originally to preside over pure criticism, so it is said that if Liu Yi were not employed, pure criticism would inevitably be overturned.

In the Jin Dynasty, "pure talk" and "pure criticism" could no longer be confused, but in practice, people still occasionally used the terminology of the previous era. A few such occasional examples can still be found in historical records. *Book of Liang*, Volume 53, *Biography of Shen Yue*:

"Taking advantage of the times and relying on power, he greatly burdened pure talk."

*Ibid*, Volume 21, *Biographies of Wang and Chen*: "Prince of Shian, Yaoguang's memorial recommending Chen and Wang Sengru states:

'If you strive for a high position, you should still be judged by pure talk.'"

*Ibid*, Volume 50, *Biography of Fu Ting*, Ting's letter to Xu Mian states:

"In the past, Zijian did not want to rashly praise Chen Lin, fearing that he would be ridiculed by later generations. The extravagant discussions of today will perhaps not have clear talk."

*History of the Southern Dynasties*, Volume 41, *Earl of Nanfeng, Xiao Chifu with appended son Yingda*:

"The seventh son, Ji, became the governor of Weixing in the early Taiqing period, prefect of Liang Province...Liang Province has an ancient tomb called Jianjian, which is said to be Zhang Qian's tomb... (Ji opened it). At the time, he was in mourning for his mother, and was condemned by pure talk."

The above four examples all use "pure talk" as "pure criticism." It can be seen that this usage still existed in the later Southern Dynasties, although it was only a literary imitation and the facts had already diverged in meaning.

The evolution of this terminology can also be inferred to be a continuous development of thought from the Han to the Wei and Jin dynasties.

Celebrated figures in the Eastern Han dynasty, such as Jia Kui, criticized people, promoting the virtuous and censuring the wicked, meaning that their criticism of politics was also focused on people. The standard for criticism was the "moral teachings" promoted by Confucianism. *Book of Song*, Volume 64, *Biography of Zheng Xianzhi*, states: "The greatest principle of moral teachings is loyalty and filial piety." Therefore, people's character was measured by Confucian moral tenets. If they did not meet the standard, they would be scorned and violate pure criticism. However, there were also priorities in moral teachings, which had to be discussed. Thus, topics such as "the priority of benevolence and filial piety" and "loyalty and filial piety cannot coexist" arose. These kinds of topics could also be heard in the pure talk of the Wei and Jin dynasties, although they were not the main part of pure talk.

Since the Han people used morality as the standard for criticizing people, they inevitably neglected the aspect of talent. In times of peace, emphasizing virtue over talent did not cause any problems, but in the great chaos of the late Han, it was felt that people of pure morality were not necessarily capable of restoring order. Cao Cao resolutely put forward the slogan "only talent should be recommended," which is something everyone knows. Thus, the debate about talent and nature arose. Wang Chong's *Lunheng*, *On Human Nature* chapter, already said, "Human nature has good and evil, just as talent has high and low." The Han people advocated "sharing the purity of the good and sharing the filth of the evil." From Fan Pang's words in the *Book of Han*, *Biography of Party and Gang*, they completely focused on the aspect of nature and the expression of nature. Cao Cao, however, turned this around and focused on the aspect of talent and the expression of talent. *Shi Shuo Xin Yu*, *Literary Studies* chapter, note quoting the *Wei Zhi*:

"(Zhong) Hui's treatises on the similarities and differences between talent and nature were passed down to the world. There were four versions: talent and nature are the same, talent and nature are different, talent and nature are united, and talent and nature are separated. Shangshu Zhuan Zhou argued for sameness, Zhongshuling Li Feng argued for difference, Shilang Zhong Hui argued for unity, and Tunqi Xiaowei Wang Guang argued for separation." Although the four treatises on talent and nature have been lost, it can be inferred that their content was nothing more than theories of personal criticism. *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, Volume 22, *Lu Yu Biography*:

"Yu, in his assessment of people and selection of officials, always considered character and conduct first and then spoke of talent. Huangmen Li Feng once asked Yu about this. Yu said, 'Talent is the means by which one does good. Therefore, great talent achieves great good, and small talent achieves small good. If one is called talented but cannot do good, it means that their talent is not suited to the task.' Feng and others were convinced by his words."

Li was discussing the difference between talent and nature, so he did not agree with Lu Yu's standard of "character and conduct first, then talent" for selecting and criticizing officials. Although Lu Yu was not one of the four theorists, his argument clearly united talent and nature and applied the theory of personal criticism to political affairs. It can be seen that the four theses on talent and nature debated by the pure talkers also inherited or opposed the standards of criticism between the Han and Wei dynasties.

The discussions of Zhong Hui, Jia Kui, and others were called the "study of names and principles" at the time. *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, Volume 10, Note to the *Biography of Xun Yu* dividing the biographies of He Shao and Xun Can:

"Can once said to (Zhuan) Zhou, 'You and others will surely surpass me in worldly affairs and fame, but your understanding is inferior to mine.' Zhou challenged him, saying, 'It is understanding that enables great success and fame. Who in the world has a deficiency in the root but an abundance in the branches?' Can said, 'Success and fame are rewards for ambition and scope. In that case, ambition and scope are one thing in themselves and not achieved solely by understanding. I can make you wealthy, but I may not be equal to what you do.'"

This passage discusses the separation and unity of "ambition" and "understanding" and is also a study of names and principles. The study of names and principles is a kind of learning for criticizing people.

The main topic of the pure talkers was ultimately the "debate between being and non-being" or the similarities and differences between moral teachings and nature. This topic certainly concluded in ultimate righteousness and had broad implications that cannot be limited to personal criticism. However, the earliest intention of pitting nature against moral teachings was still related to this. The Han people regarded moral teachings as their refuge, but in the Wei and Jin dynasties, they became tools for political manipulation, used to eliminate dissidents and flatter the authorities. Therefore, some people who were unwilling to cooperate with the authorities proposed "nature" from Taoist doctrines as an alternative. They established themselves with a different standard and used it to criticize people. The story of He Zeng wanting to kill Ruan Ji is well known. Regardless of whether He Zeng could practice the moral teachings he advocated himself, or whether Ruan Ji truly despised moral teachings, He Zeng's criticism of Ruan Ji was based on moral teachings, while Ruan Ji's self-presentation was that of a transcendent. It was still a difference in the standards of personal criticism. *Book of Jin*, Volume 49, *Ruan Ji Biography*:

"Pei Kai went to mourn him (when Ji was in mourning for his mother). Ji let his hair down and sat with his legs apart, drunk and staring straight ahead. Kai finished mourning and left. Someone asked Kai, 'Usually, the host cries and the guest follows the etiquette. Ji did not cry, so why did you cry?' Kai said, 'Ruan Ji is a transcendent, so he does not adhere to ritual and etiquette. I am a man of the mundane world, so I abide by norms and regulations.' People at the time admired them both for getting it right."

The reason people at the time admired them both for getting it right was because they used two different standards to criticize Pei and Ruan. The *Biography of Ruan Ji* also says, "Ji's speech was profound and distant, and he did not praise or criticize people." Of course, this was one of his ways to avoid disaster, but since he dared to openly resist the moral teachings advocated by the ruler, this was all the more likely to bring disaster. It can be seen that it was not entirely for avoiding disaster. He often used blue and white eyes to express his attitude, so how could he not have praised or criticized?

In summary, although "pure talk" and "pure criticism" went their separate ways in later generations and cannot be confused, judging from the topics of the pure talkers, pure talk was actually nurtured from pure criticism.

### On the History of Nanzhao

— Xiang Da

—A Brief Study of Tang Dynasty Records of Nanzhao—

In the sixth month of the fifth year of Xiantong, he was appointed as the Chief Clerk of the Governor-General's Office of Kuizhou. He inquired about the origins of the Man, Yi, Ba, and Xia four cities and recorded them all, sending them to the major chieftains of Annam, recording them in detail in this work, the Man Zhi in ten volumes, so that one may know the order of events from beginning to end concerning the southern barbarians.

This passage may be the author's preface, misplaced here. The name of the *Man Shu* varies among different books. The *New Book of Tang*, *Treatise on Literature*, *Comprehensive Mirror*, *Old Anecdotes*, Cheng Dachang's *Yu Gong Lun*, and Cai Shen's *Book of Documents, Collection of Commentaries* call it *Man Shu*; Jun Zhai's *Reading Records*, the *History of the Song Dynasty*, *Treatise on Literature*, the Yuan Dynasty's Li Jing's *Yunnan Zhi Lue*, and the early Ming Dynasty's Cheng Benli call it *Yunnan Zhi*; the *History of the Song Dynasty* also mentions Fan Chuo's *Southern Barbarian Records*, both in ten volumes; Su Song's *Illustrated Materia Medica* calls it *Yunnan Ji*; the *Yongle Encyclopedia* calls it *Yunnan Shi Ji*; and the *Taiping Yulan* calls it *Southern Yi Zhi*. The *Complete Library in Four Sections* records the name according to the *New Book of Tang*. According to Fan Chuo's own statement in the *Man Shu*, calling it the *Man Zhi* in ten volumes, it seems that the name recorded in the *New Book of Tang* is closer to the truth. The *Man Shu* continued to circulate after the Song Dynasty. Li Jing's preface to the *Yunnan Zhi Lue* mentions this book by Fan Chuo. In the early Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, Cheng Benli was appointed as the Yunnan Administrator. In Lijiang, he saw Fan Chuo's *Yunnan Zhi* in the hands of Prefect Zhang and this event was recorded in the *Record of a Western Journey to Yunnan* in the *Collected Works of Mr. Xunyin*. Since it was included in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* during the Yongle period, the book was no longer transmitted, so the *Summary of the Complete Library in Four Sections* says "Even someone as erudite as Yang Shen said that Chuo's book existed only in record, not in book form." As for Volume 2 and Volume 3 of the *Wanli Yunnan Tongzhi*, although both quote Fan Chuo's *Yunnan Zhi*, the text is quite different from the extant book and more like the language of later local chronicles. It is feared that this is a misinterpretation of hearsay, and Fan's book had already been lost by the mid-Ming Dynasty. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, when compiling the *Complete Library in Four Sections*, the officials first compiled Fan's book from the *Yongle Encyclopedia*, dividing it into ten volumes according to the *Treatise on Literature* in the *New Book of Tang*, and collating it with the *Biography of Nanzhao* in the *New Book of Tang* and the *Corrections to the Comprehensive Mirror*. The *Man Shu* then circulated in the world again. In addition to the *Complete Library in Four Sections* edition, there is the Wuying Hall Precious Edition, the Tonghua Hall edition of the Qianlong period, Wang Zhiyi's Zhenqi Hall edition, the Guangya Press Precious Edition Congxiao Edition, the Linlang Secret Chamber Series edition, the Jianxi Village Hermitage edition, and the Yunnan Beizheng Zhi edition, totaling seven versions. The Tonghua Hall edition and those that followed are all derived from the Wuying Hall Precious Edition; but the Hall Edition, Tonghua Hall Edition, and Zhenqi Hall Edition are rarely seen. The Hall Edition probably comes from the Wen Yuan Ge Siku, the summary written in the second month of the thirty-ninth year of Qianlong, the earliest time; the Wen Jin was in the forty-ninth year, and the Wen Su was in the forty-seventh year, the texts of the two summaries being the same, but differing from the Hall Edition, and the texts inside the book also having slight differences. We now surmise that most of the *Man Shu* in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* was included in one rhyme, so Mr. Zhao Wanli, who saw the most of the *Yongle Encyclopedia* in China, did not see the *Man Shu* being quoted, and Mr. Wang Zhongmin, who saw the most of the *Yongle Encyclopedia* abroad, saw only one entry; it is likely that the volume of the Encyclopedia that quoted the *Man Shu* was lost in the Boxer Rebellion, or at some unknown time.

Because the original Encyclopedia no longer exists, there is no way to correct any errors in the Complete Library edition. However, from the annotations of the Complete Library officials, we can still see that some places in the current Man Shu were mistakenly changed by the officials, such as: in the current edition, Volume 4 begins with the record of Cuan Gui killing Gai Pin and Gai Qi, father and son. In the Yongle Encyclopedia, Gai Pin and Gai Qi are written as Meng Ke and Meng Qi, and the officials corrected it according to the New Book of Tang. However, in Zhang Jiuling's Collected Works, in the edict to Annam Ren Zhe, there is a Meng Pin, magistrate of Shengma County, from which we can know that the New Book of Tang mistakenly wrote Meng as Gai. The Encyclopedia's Meng is not mistaken, only Meng Pin is mistakenly written as Meng Ke. The Complete Library officials failed to widely consult Tang books, resulting in this error. Also, the Southern Yi Zhi quoted in the Imperial Readings is another name for the Man Shu, and there are many places where it can collate and supplement the current edition. For example, at the end of the Stone Gate Road section in Volume 1, the phrase large tribes has what would be the ghost below, the text is missing, making it unintelligible. The South Clip Record quoted in the entries on the tribes of the wild Man of the 7th, 8th, and 9th riots is exactly the current text of this section, with complete text. The officials did not know how to utilize it, resulting in many regrets remaining in the current edition. In addition, there are many misplaced slips in the original Encyclopedia, such as the 58 characters at the end of the Dujin Man entry in the current Volume 4, which are not relevant to the context, and the 52 characters at the beginning of Volume 5, which are not related to the following text. The entry at the end of Volume 8 should not be in the Customs section; these are all misplaced slips. The officials' indications of where these misplaced slips should be are all very reasonable. Therefore, although the current edition of the Man Shu survives thanks to the Encyclopedia, it still needs to be carefully collated and restored. Among the three hundred years of empirical research during the Qing Dynasty, research on the history of southern regions was too bleak.

The Secretarial Division divides it into the internal routes of Yunnan, from the source of the Sichuan River, the Six Zhao, names and categories, the Six Dangers, the Yunnan City, the products within Yunnan's jurisdiction, the customs of the barbarians, the teachings for the southern barbarians, the names of the countries adjacent to the southern barbarian borders, totaling ten volumes. The book includes the ethnicities, history, geography, products, customs, systems of Yunnan in the medieval period, as well as the problems of neighboring barbarian countries, which is extremely complex. Each problem requires extensive research and study. The Man Shu should be discussed in a separate article. Here, only a brief introduction to the version content can be given. (Written in Beiping on the 26th day of the ninth month of the 36th year). (End of section)

### Three Letters on the Twelve Hours of Zhi Gong

— Zhou Yiliang Hu Shi

(I)

To My Esteemed Friends,

Upon returning last night, I carefully translated Zhi Gong's "Twelve Hours Ode" and found it quite unbelievable. I have several doubts, which I dare to express to you, hoping for your correction.

First, regarding the Luoyang Monastery (as recorded in Volume II, Chongzhen Temple section: "King Yama said: Those who request scriptures harbor selfishness and arrogance, bullying others. They are like deer among monks. Now, we only test them by sitting in meditation and chanting scriptures, not by lecturing on them"). It also says, "The essence of a monk lies in focusing the mind and guarding the spirit, with the will set on chanting." It seems that during the Six Dynasties, there was a branch of Buddhism that did not focus on lectures but emphasized chanting. However, the sutras mentioned here still belong to the Hinayana Chan meditation of An Shigao's time, which is quite different from the Chan sect since the Tang Dynasty, which does not rely on writing but transmits mind to mind. The "Twelve Hours Ode," "Great Vehicle Praise," and "Fourteen Categories of Praise," attributed to Zhi Gong in the Transmission of the Lamp, do not differ greatly in content and represent the Chan Buddhist thought of the period after Huineng. In the "Twelve Hours Ode," the lines "Only guard the mystery, without words," as well as the criticism of "searching for lines and counting characters" in the "Great Vehicle Praise" and the discussion of the non-duality of truth and falsehood in the "Fourteen Categories of Praise," although seemingly consistent with the Chongzhen Temple section of the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang, are actually different matters. In essence, I suspect that the ideas in these three pieces could not have existed in the Six Dynasties or, at least, could not have been expressed in such a developed manner. Yuan Nianchang's "Chronicle of Buddhas and Patriarchs Through the Ages," Volume 9, states that Baozhi "composed ten chapters of 'Great Vehicle Praise' and fourteen chapters of 'Category Praise,' along with the 'Twelve Hours Song,' all of which clearly express profound meanings, their essence being in accord with the Chan school, and they are widely circulated in the world today." This likely recognizes that their time of origin is impossible, hence the phrase "in accord."

Second, the writing style of these three pieces is consistent, suggesting they are not very early. My intuition tells me that they are not works of the Six Dynasties, though it is difficult to "bring evidence" to prove this. Words like "Patriarch" and "A Shu" seem to have only appeared after the Six Dynasties. Unfortunately, I have not yet thoroughly examined the books.

Third, the "Biographies of Eminent Monks" by Huijiao, Volume 10, the biography of Baozhi, is in the section on "Divine Abilities," and the records of his actions are all mythical tales. Those who wrote about Zhi Gong did not mention these three pieces, only stating, "Sometimes he composed poems, his words like righteousness records." Furthermore, in other texts, such as Daoxuan's "Further Biographies of Eminent Monks," Volume 5, the biography of Fayun; Xiao Zixian's preface to the imperial lecture on the Prajna Sutra (Collected Works on the Propagation and Clarification of Buddhism, Volume 19); Emperor Wu of Liang's "Ode to Pure Karma" (ibid., Volume 29); the "History of Liang," Volume 37, the biography of He Jingrong; the "History of Chen," Volume 26, the biography of Xu Ling; the "History of the Southern Dynasties," Volume 7, the basic annals of the Liang Dynasty; and the "Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang," Volume 4, the White Horse Temple section, etc., the records of Zhi's actual deeds are all related to divine abilities or prophecies. It is difficult to recognize this kind of divine monk, whose specialty was divine transformations and illusions, as the author of the works collected in the Transmission of the Lamp.

Fourth, the reason why Chan monks of later generations attributed these three pieces to Zhi Gong was probably strategic. In Huijiao's "Biographies of Eminent Monks," Volume 3, the biography of Tanmoliye She, it is said that "Although he was clear on the Three Baskets, he specialized in meditation. Every time he went for a stroll, he might not get up for seven days... The monk Zhi studied his meditation books." Could this section be the origin of the connection between Zhi Gong and later Chan Buddhism? Huijiao's biography of Baozhi also states, "Someone asked about the meaning of the twelve, and he replied: The meaning lies in the hours and moments recorded in the book. Those who know understand that the book resides within the twelve hours." Could the "Twelve Hours Ode" have been written based on this hint?

In conclusion, I believe that the "Twelve Hours Ode" was likely written by later generations and falsely attributed to Zhi Gong. However, I am not sure whether the twelve-hour format for rhyming prose was already in use during the Liang Dynasty. Therefore, although the ode may be fake, its format need not be fake. However, the "Book of Sui," Volume 15, the "Records of Music," states that Emperor Yang of Sui "ordered the music official Bai Mingda to create new sounds, creating the 'Ten Thousand Years Music'... and the 'Twelve Hours' tunes... The Emperor... said to his favored ministers: Those who play many tunes are like those who read many books. Reading many books enables one to write books, and playing many tunes enables one to create tunes. This is a natural principle." The twelve-hour tunes of the music and this "Twelve Hours Ode" must be related. I strongly suspect that this format actually originated in the Sui Dynasty. I have written this haphazardly, hoping that you will not hesitate to give me guidance. I wish you well! Your younger brother, Yiliang, bows respectfully.

Brother Chongmin,

I have read your letter to Mr. Yiliang and his discussion of the Twelve Hours.

Baozhi's "Twelve Hours Song," like other poems, is very good vernacular, and the reasoning is very clear. If it were really a text before the Tang Dynasty, the two volumes of the Collected Works on the Propagation and Clarification of Buddhism would not have failed to include it. The fact that these songs are not included in the two Collected Works on the Propagation and Clarification of Buddhism allows us to deduce that they are late works.

The "Yi Hour Song" of the Twelve Hours says, "The Patriarch said," the "Hai Hour Song" says, "Surpassing Sakyamuni, exceeding the era," and the "Zi Hour Song" says, "The Patriarch said, external affairs." These are idioms from after the mid-Tang Dynasty. The forger did not know history, so he left this handle. (Omission)

Shizhi, 36th year, 11th month, 21st night

(III)

My Esteemed Brother Yousan,

Regarding Baozhi's "Twelve Hours Ode," I have another thought that I did not mention in my previous letter, so I am supplementing it here.

During the Six Dynasties, the convention was that when abbreviating monks' double names, only the last character was used, such as Dao An being called An He Shang and Hui Yuan being called Yuan Gong. There are many such examples, but there were no cases of using the first character. When transliterating barbarian names into Chinese, the last character was also taken, such as Yuwen Heilai or Hei Xun (people in the Sui and Tang Dynasties often took "Hei Xun" as their name, which was probably this character) being shortened to Yuwen Tai; Gao Huan's barbarian name Heluhun being shortened to "Hun" and then changed to "Huan"; and Heba Yun's barbarian name Aju Ni being shortened to Heba Ni. This was the common practice at the time. In the "Biography of Fayun" quoted in my previous letter, it is abbreviated as "Zhi," and in the "Ode to Pure Karma," it is called "Zhi Gong." Only in the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang is it called "Bao Gong." Therefore, whether this Bao Gong is Baozhi (or Baozhi) is a big question.

The Twelve Zodiac Songs in the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang may be the earliest example. Perhaps Bai Mingda adopted this format for the lyrics and composed a tune for them? Chan monks in the Tang Dynasty probably mixed the Twelve Zodiac Songs of Zhi Gong in the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang with the text of Tanmoliye She's biography in Huijiao's "Biography of Baozhi" and created the story that Baozhi wrote the "Twelve Hours Ode" and then wrote this ode to make it a reality. (Omission)

Your younger brother, Yiliang, respectfully presents. January 18th, 37th year

### Postscript to the Facsimile Edition of the Tang Code Commentary, Third Series of the Four Treasures Serial Publication

— Wang Chongmin

According to the original name of this book, "Code Commentary," Changsun Wuji and others presented a memorial saying, "Compiled the Code Commentary in thirty volumes." The commentary also states, "Compiled the Code Commentary with Li Ji and nineteen others and presented it in a memorial." Volume 1, "Nomenclature," contains a commentary explaining the meaning of the word "commentary," saying that it takes the example of the commentaries on the classics, wanting to combine exegesis and commentary to clarify it. The explanation of the naming is particularly clear. Both the Sui History "Record of Sutras and Writings" and citations by people in the Song Dynasty also refer to it as "Code Commentary." The handwritten book unearthed in Dunhuang is also titled "Code Commentary," all of which are clear evidence. I wrote a postscript for the Dunhuang manuscript, where I also suspected this, but said that "Code Commentary" has the same meaning, connecting "commentary" to "discussions," which began with the people of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, which was still not definitive. At that time, I only saw the Dainan Pavilion's reproduction of the Yuan edition. Now I see the Song edition collected by Ni Huiqi, facsimiled in the Third Series of the Four Treasures Serial Publication. After the text of the code, the commentary is indented one space, although both are crowned with the two characters "Commentary and Discussions." In the Yuan edition, both characters are in intaglio, while in the Song edition, only the character "Commentary" is in intaglio, while the character "Discussions" continues to the sentence below. This one-character difference between intaglio and relief can enlighten my thinking and help me understand a lot. The articles are the code, and those who explain the articles are the commentary. The code and commentary are like the classics and their commentaries. What Changsun Wuji and the nineteen others discussed were all explanations of the articles, all "commentaries." In the Song edition, the character "Commentary" in intaglio is followed closely by "Discussion," which is exactly the matter. Because Changsun and others took the ancient codes as discussions, they uniformly crowned the discussed text with the two characters "Discussions." Since "Discussions" and below are the words of the commentary, they are placed below the character "Commentary" in intaglio, which is very clear and easy to distinguish. The Dunhuang edition does not have the character "Commentary," only "Discussions," because what is discussed in "Discussions" is placed in the position of "Commentary," which can be seen to be a commentary. The Song edition has the character "Commentary" in intaglio, and the Dunhuang edition does not have the character "Commentary" in intaglio, but their meanings are the same, without any errors. The Yuan edition puts "Commentary and Discussions" in intaglio together, which loses the original meaning. However, for hundreds of years, no one has noticed the mistake.

The postscript to the Tang Code Commentary in the Guisi Drafts, Volume 12, says, "The book is named 'Commentary' because it clarifies the code and its points; it is named 'Discussions' because it clarifies the deep meaning of the code and what the code does not cover or reach, like Dong Zhongshu's 'Spring and Autumn Judgments' and Ying Shao's 'Resolving Affairs,' and also like collections of refutations." It also does not know that "commentary and discussions" are the same thing, both being "clarifications of the code and its points" and "clarifications of the deep meaning of the code and what the code does not cover or reach."

Free Talk

### Democracy 101

— Jingwen

I haven't been to the park in a while, partly because the weather is too cold and partly because there's nothing to see in the park at this time except people looking at people. But I heard that the park has abandoned the ticket collection method and switched to a system where visitors vote themselves in, so I was quite eager to see it. So, the other day, I took a detour to a certain park.

It happened to be a Sunday, and the weather was good, so there were quite a few people in the park. As far as I could see, except for certain people who entered through the exit, the rest of the visitors who entered orderly through the entrance almost all bought tickets and tore them up themselves, throwing them into the wire-mesh trash cans. There were very few people trying to get in for free.

I think this measure by the park management is worth praising. In most countries in Europe and America, parks are naturally open to the public because citizens pay taxes, and park expenses are already included in the municipal budget. Even in the inland areas of China, many parks do not require tickets.

The reason why Shanghai's parks require tickets, I guess, probably originated from the original "No Chinese and dogs allowed" sign. Later, although "Chinese" were also allowed in, the municipal authorities, then under the control of foreigners, still felt that there should be some restrictions, so visitors to the park had to buy tickets. Although it was only a dime or two at the time, for the "lower-class Chinese" of that time, a dime or two was a considerable sum. In fact, the park visitors at that time were mostly well-dressed people who didn't care about a dime or two.

The reason for restricting "Chinese" was probably because civic education was not yet widespread at that time. For example, some people arbitrarily broke branches and flowers, trampled on the grass, etc., which were undeniable facts. Even now, these kinds of uncivilized behaviors still exist. However, the method of dealing with this kind of behavior is not as effective as using mandatory restrictions as it is to adopt an inductive approach.

The current change of the park's ticket system to an automatic method can be seen as a prelude to the complete free opening of the park. In fact, spending one or two thousand yuan to visit the park once is something even beggars can do now. But the significance of this matter is not the issue of a few dollars for tickets, but an experiment in civic education.

Speaking of automatic systems, the United States should be said to be the most advanced country. The automatic ticket-buying system on public streetcars has long been widely implemented. Now, many economic cafeterias and department stores have also adopted automatic payment systems. When you go to a food store to buy something, no one will monitor you. You only need to pay the value of the goods according to the price tag on the item. For things like chewing gum that cost five cents a pack or cigarettes that cost a dime a pack, there are even automatic payment and delivery machines. Even shoe shines have automatic machines. You only need to insert a dime (equivalent to 20 cents in U.S. currency) like you would to make a public phone call, and put your shoes on the footrest, and they will be shined in a few minutes.

Of course, the purpose of this kind of automatic system in the United States is not to guide civic morality, but to achieve commercial goals. It is said that the automatic purchase and payment system can increase the sales of goods. But such a system can only be implemented in countries where civic morality is relatively high, which is probably an undeniable fact.

Things are a bit different here. Although the four words of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame are prominently displayed at the top of the International Hotel, some people still think it is an honor to enjoy special privileges. The habit of riding in white cars and watching free shows is something that everyone has long been accustomed to. I think this may have nothing to do with integrity and shame, but rather with the conditions of economic life. However, people who have no economic problems (such as buying an electric ticket) often think that being able to get away with it is a matter of face because of their "uniqueness."

The greatest significance of the automatic system is to enlighten people's concepts of rights and obligations, and being able to understand the relationship between rights and obligations is the starting point for implementing democracy. The greatest obstacle to the implementation of democracy in China is that there are still too many people in society who like to enjoy special privileges. I hope that in the future, people who go to the park not only go to breathe some fresh air, but also to practice the first lesson of democracy.

Today, there are as many as 1,200 different sizes of nails manufactured in the world. The smallest is only 3/16 of an inch long and weighs 1/6000 of an ounce, while the largest is 15 inches long (used for shipbuilding) and weighs 26 ounces (16 ounces per pound). The difference in weight between the smallest and largest nail is 156,060 times.

### People Think of "Hi"!

—

At the beginning of the victory, when the receiving officials came to Shanghai to handle the receiving work, things did not go smoothly. Mr. Zhang Henshui was the first to shout a slogan, calling "People think of English and Chinese." This slogan, of course, does not need to be explained, but hidden behind this sentence is what a painful lesson it contains! Knowing that what is past cannot be remedied, and knowing that what is to come can be pursued, is precisely the guiding principle that we should urgently and directly seek, and it is also the demeanor that a country advocating democracy should possess. In German military camps, there are also people who think of Hitler.

At the beginning of this year, the United Kingdom and the United States indicated that they would establish a republic in western Germany, which would issue its own currency, manage its finances, manage domestic and foreign trade, and lead elections. In short, from all aspects, it is an independent and autonomous government. The question is whether Germany, which has been subjected to Nazi education for twelve years, can kick it aside and accept a democratic life. That is a question.

A French magazine called Esprit collected a large number of letters, which were not originally intended to be published, so they could speak freely. The letter writers ranged from university professors to laborers, and most of them were not very concerned about the American method, but expressed a longing for Hitler's national socialism. Therefore, the New York-published Magazine Digest added a reprint, they did not find this kind of argument objectionable, taking what is useful. The attitude of democratic countries is particularly worth emulating. The editors of Magazine Digest also added a note: "Judging from these letters, if the new Germany is not a re-edition of the Nazis, then American re-education and democratization should be restarted and accelerated."

One letter admitted that the National Socialist Party had bad elements, and their actions were opposed by Hitler, but he praised the party's discipline, training, and decisive style. It is said that Hitler lacked the talent of a diplomat and was forced into war. The Germans did not want to fight, and Hitler did not want to fight.

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Eleven Full of Doubts (82)

As Zhu Zhai thought about it this way, his mind became more peaceful. He was busy going to work early in the morning. When it was time to get off work, he came to Qi Wan's house. Qi Wan had already left. According to Aunt Wang, "Early this morning, Director Miao called, urging the boss to go there. The boss delayed until 3:00 PM, when Director Miao sent a car to pick her up, and then she left. Before the boss left, Director Miao called several times, and later, I don't know what they said, but the boss got very angry and hung up the phone, ignoring him. Judging from the boss's expression, she doesn't seem to be very close to this Mr. Miao." Hearing this, Zhu Zhai couldn't help but say, "Amitabha, I hope so." Aunt Wang laughed and said, "Mr. Xu is also chanting Buddha now." Zhu Zhai said, "I am very worried that the boss knows this Mr. Miao, because this kind of military man is very difficult to deal with. If the result is that she gets burned, it won't be worth it!" Aunt Wang said, "Well, Mr. Xu, you can advise her. Besides, everyone knows about the future of you two, the word has spread!" Zhu Zhai smiled and said, "What are they saying outside?" Aunt Wang said, "Who doesn't know that the boss is going to marry you!" Zhu Zhai said, "I only hope that there won't be any changes along the way!" Aunt Wang said, "What changes could there be?" Zhu Zhai hesitated for a moment and suddenly asked, "Mr. Xu, does your family know about you and the boss getting married?" Zhu Zhai asked in surprise, "What do you mean by that?" Aunt Wang really wanted to tell Zhu Zhai that Yu Ru had come to find Qi Wan the day before, but she thought that there might be other reasons, and Qi Wan didn't allow her to say it, so she held back. After a slight hesitation, she smiled and said, "It's nothing, I thought that in such a major matter as marriage, your family's old master must have known about it long ago." Zhu Zhai had no choice but to agree, "Of course they knew long ago!" Aunt Wang said, "Have you been in contact with that Miss Zhang these past few days? The boss often says that Miss Tong is a college student, and she is not as good as her." Zhu Zhai said, "I haven't been with her for a long time." Aunt Wang said, "Then there's nothing wrong. I'm just being too sensitive." Saying this, she smiled again, took a step back, and let Zhu Zhai out. After hearing these words from Aunt Wang, Zhu Zhai's heart was suddenly filled with doubts. After thinking about it carefully, his family definitely didn't know about getting married to Qi Wan, and even Yun Qing and Feng Sheng would never have thought of it.

### How Not to Get Drunk

— Yuwentu

How can you drink without getting drunk? After several experiments, I have come to the following conclusions: (1) Drink alone—the amount and duration are up to you, and you are not forced or restrained by the crowd when drinking together, so you can stop at a moderate point and you won't get into a messy state that abuses yourself and others. (2) Avoid thinking—it fills the intestines with sorrow, and on the surface it is excitement, but in reality, the inside and outside are uncoordinated, the contradictions are sharpened, and the pain is deepened. The wise do not take this approach, so when savoring the flavor in the cup, be sure not to change your mind or use your brain. (3) Avoid beauty—the "beauty" mentioned here refers to women who are very likely to destroy the drinker's "drinking style." Once she is by your side, not to mention mediocre people, even wise men often ignore the value of the wine and unknowingly waste a lot of precious nectar.

If you want to drink without getting drunk and always stay clear-headed, the above is a proven formula that you may want to try.

Another person wrote from Berlin, believing that Germany's only mistake was not shedding enough blood during the revolution. The Soviet Union cleared out all its enemies during the revolution, and France had the guillotine. But in Hitler's time, everything went very smoothly. Unemployment disappeared, there was no low pay, and the whole country restored order. At the end, he admitted that Hitler's actions were wrong in certain aspects.

A German anti-Nazi, who had lived in a concentration camp for six years, wrote that after the victory, famous Nazis were not only not in jail, but were in important positions. Germans are openly discussing the next war, and as soon as the Allies leave Germany, the old Nazi spirit will be revived immediately. Germany will one day be back in a combat position. His conclusion is that the spots on a leopard will never change.

Some people questioned whether other countries had any wrongdoings, whether they had concentration camps. He believes that Germany is just a vast penal camp, but those who sow seeds of hatred cannot reap the fruit of love. Some people believe that the conquerors will take away the Germans' opportunities. The Germans' production is not for themselves; they are working hard for others. One worker said, "Hitler wants us to be good Nazis, the Americans want us to be good democrats, maybe tomorrow the Soviets will want us to be good communists. What about after the Soviets... God knows!"

The above can be seen as "people's grievances." If the British and French authorities are willing to listen to the people's grievances and correct them if they have them, and encourage them if they don't, then the great way to rule the world lies in this!

Have you ever wondered who invented eating shellfish? How did we start eating jellyfish skin? Perhaps no one can answer these questions now.

Human eating habits vary with time and region. At one time, our ancestors ate nothing but animals with fur. To this day, many local delicacies sound horrifying to outsiders.

People in Oregon in the United States like to eat rattlesnakes, saying they taste like a mixture of pork and chicken. And the French believe that nothing is more delicious than snails. You've certainly heard that people in some places love to eat rats. (Editor's note: There are many rats in Yunnan. During the war, when Mr. Pan Guangdan taught at Southwest Associated University, he was initially troubled by the many rats. Later, he adopted the principle of "diligently catching" them, and gained quite a bit of spoils, so he "braised" several of them to treat his students. The students initially did not know what they were eating, and praised it as Mrs. Pan's specialty chicken chicks.)

There are many things that ancient people ate that modern people think cannot be eaten. For example, Romans ate caterpillars, believing they were similar to almonds. Epicures in Caesar's time liked to eat ants fried in white sugar and butter. They also liked to eat spiders, parrot tongues, and ostrich meat.

Europeans first ate potatoes (foreign yams) at the end of the sixteenth century. The first person to eat them was an Englishman named Thomas Harriot, who wanted to use potatoes to commit suicide. That was in 1584. Harriot returned from exploring the Americas and thought of a girl he was deeply in love with, but could not get rid of. So, he cooked a potato grown by an Indian, because it was said to be very poisonous and could kill you. As a result, he didn't die. The claim that potatoes are poisonous was also broken.

Tomatoes, which people today call rich in vitamins A, B, and C, were once thought to be very poisonous. In 1834, an old grandmother tried various methods to cure her sick and thin grandson, so she handed him a tomato. According to legend, this was the beginning of humans eating tomatoes.

According to legend, the first to discover the consumption of coffee was an Abyssinian donkey during the time of Charlemagne the Great. The owner of this donkey discovered that whenever it passed the foot of a mountain, no matter how much he kicked or whipped it, the donkey would not take another step unless it was allowed to eat its fill of a shrub growing at the foot of the mountain. And after it had eaten its fill, it would be full of energy, but he would have to kick it and whip it to make it stop. Finally, the donkey owner discovered that the shrubs at the foot of the mountain bore fruit. He chewed it and found it delicious and stimulating. Later, people in the Western Hemisphere had long been boiling coffee to drink, and explorers still found Abyssinians chewing coffee berries.

### The Green City and Dragon Mountain of the Northwest (Part 2)

— Junzuo

Crossing the Yunlong Bridge, one ascends Dragon Mountain. There is only one wide road leading up this high mountain, and the slope and curves are gentler than those of栖 Yun Mountain. After crossing Yunlong Bridge, one finds Dragon King Temple. To the north of the temple is a small hut, also enshrining the statue of Wu Yuanzi, adorned with powder and carved like a Western doll, quite different from the warrior statue on栖 Yun Mountain. There is also a statue of Confucius, with a powdered face and turban, resembling the incarnation of Zhuge Liang. Looking at the clay sculptures on both the east and west mountains, none have artistic value. However, the mountains themselves are worthy of being famous mountains of the Northwest. If there were just one Tang dynasty sculpture with upright horns, it would greatly enhance the beauty of both mountains. Going south from the Dragon King Temple, there is a small divine cave. Further up is the Jade Liquid Spring, where water emerges from the stone crevices, accumulating into a well of unparalleled clarity. The spring is located in the corridor of the Guandi Temple. To the left is the Stone Bodhisattva Hall, and to the right is the Guandi Hall. Ascending the slope eastward, there is the Lingguan Hall with three rooms, and further up is the Bodhisattva Hall. On the brick wall behind the hall, there is an embedded Chinese translation of Genghis Khan's last will, stating: "If a vast territory and numerous people wish to resist foreign enemies, they must unite their hearts as one." This famous saying will forever be a principle for a nation to strive for survival. To the upper right of the Bodhisattva Hall is the Taibai Palace, also known as the Mausoleum of Genghis Khan. The Mausoleum of Genghis Khan was temporarily housed in the Taibai Palace on Xinglong Mountain in the summer of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939) upon the recommendation of Prince Sha and with the approval of the Central Government, having been moved from the Ejin Horoo banner of the Ih Ju League in Suiyuan. The Taibai Palace, also named the Great Buddha Hall, has neat buildings, but they are not spacious and are gradually deteriorating. The loneliness of a wasteland for a hero of the ages evokes endless sorrow when mourning. Visiting the mausoleum, one is guided by a Mongolian official. Upon entering the hall, one first bows in respect. The hall is draped with yellow cloth, and the sides are filled with wreaths, elegiac couplets, and plaques. In the center hangs a portrait of Genghis Khan, whose image is robust and resolute, inspiring awe. In front is Genghis Khan's silver coffin, 120 cm long, 77 cm wide, and 99.5 cm thick. The coffin is inlaid with gold-carved patterns and studded with pearls and gems, covered with multiple pieces of colored silk – one more piece is added during the grand sacrifice on the 18th day of the third lunar month each year. In front of the silver coffin is a framed photograph taken from a stone stele. To the left of Genghis Khan's silver coffin is the silver coffin of his concubine, Fujin, 100 cm long, 60 cm wide, and 70 cm thick. Its form and decoration are the same as the coffin of Genghis Khan. In the silver coffin of Genghis Khan, he is buried with his empress, both cremated. Burial treasures and his personal clothing during his lifetime are placed in this silver coffin. His empress and concubines have no portraits, presumably because they were virtuous and beautiful. In front of the shrine of Concubine Cheng, there is a small lacquered wooden box with a red sandalwood carved square mirror on top, 42 cm long and 32 cm wide. The mirror surface is smooth and thick, and the image is clear. It was brought back from Huanshou by Genghis Khan during his western expeditions and given to her for her dressing. Heroic figures and beauties shine through the ages. To the right of the hall is a steel spear, shimmering with silver light. The spear is 20 cm long, and the shaft is 2.50 meters long, covered in yellow silk and topped with black hair. It was the weapon used by Genghis Khan himself in his conquests, and it is accompanied by a legend – once, Genghis Khan was surrounded and prayed to Heaven, when suddenly a spear descended from the sky, which is the one mentioned above. However, this spear slowly descended without touching the ground. After the sincere pleas of this generation's hero, it finally fell into his hands at the critical moment of victory or defeat, unleashing unparalleled divine power and dominating Eurasia. The thick circle of black hair on the spearhead is said to be human hair. When Genghis Khan fought, he would pull out a hair from each person he killed and tie it to the spear. The number of hairs represents the number of people killed. Nowadays, it would take at least five or six people to lift this steel spear. The steel spear stands behind a square table, on which rests a square wooden box containing a sword, 80 cm long and 20 cm long. This was Genghis Khan's personal sword. In addition, there is a bow hanging on the wall, its size disproportionate to the spear and sword, possibly an accessory. Exiting the side door of the Taibai Palace and ascending the slope, one reaches the Yaowang Temple, and further up is the Three Holy Mothers Hall, inhabited by the Mongolian tomb keepers. Following the path further up, there is the Three Teachings Cave, with several buildings built to the left and right of the cave. The Three Teachings Cave was originally located below the Three Holy Mothers Temple, but it was moved to its current location. There is a legend: the old site of the Three Teachings Cave was remote and simple, and over the years, it had become dilapidated, with no one to burn incense. In the third month of the ninth year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing dynasty, a dove-shaped bird suddenly came to the mountain, flying back and forth and chirping mournfully. Its sound seemed to be calling out to the Three Teachings Cave. It lasted for three years and never flew away. The old Taoists and rural farmers did not know what kind of bird it was. Later, a Taoist priest named Jin Jiaoli, while meditating, suddenly realized that this bird must be the Qing bird envoy of the Three Teachings Kings, calling out to the Three Teachings Cave to ask people to rebuild it. Thereupon, this Taoist priest made a great vow and went out to raise funds, rebuilding the Three Teachings Cave at its current site. After the construction was completed, the bird disappeared silently, its whereabouts unknown. According to my thoughts: when I lived on Yucheng Mountain, there was a strange bird called the "Wooden Fish Brother," which cried mournfully at night until dawn, disturbing people's dreams. Perhaps Xinglong Mountain has this kind of bird, and the Taoist priest used this to raise funds and build the temple, with good intentions. Ascending south from the Three Teachings Cave, one soon reaches Taibai Spring, originally named Sanyuan Spring. It was renamed its current name during the Xianfeng reign of the Qing dynasty. The spring is located below the Taibai Tower. The "Taibai" is not the Taibai of Li Taibai, but the Taibai of Venus. The spring emerges from the stone crevices, one on the left and one on the right, and is guided into the water tank by stone troughs. Wooden boards are laid on the tank, and three small holes are opened at the front end of the tank, dividing the water into three round holes in front of the tank. In front of the holes is a half-moon-shaped pool to hold the spring water flowing from the holes. Below the stone steps in front of the hall, there is a round stone trough, with a stone dragon head in front of the trough, spitting water from the dragon's mouth into the trough. From this stone trough, a small hole leads the water into the deep abyss in front of the hall. This spring is clear as a mirror, with a sweet and delicious taste. The bottom of the water is covered with many small stones. It is said that anyone who wants to have a child only needs to go upstairs, kowtow to Venus and plead, then go downstairs and reach deeply into the hole for a small stone, and give it to his wife, and she will have many precious children. The loveliness of Taibai Spring is not purely because it has clear and delicious spring water, but also because it offers a distant view of the beautiful scenery of Saddle Mountain and a close view of the enchanting scenery of栖 Yun Mountain. On both sides of the main hall of the spring, there are three wing rooms each, with clean tables and bright windows, making them the best places to view the mountain scenery. However, the Taoists of Taibai Spring are truly pitifully poor. In the kitchen, there is nothing but coarse flour and salt. Although the mountain tea has a unique flavor, it is quite bitter. Therefore, those who visit Taibai Spring must bring their own food, which can be cooked in the kitchen here. The entire scenery of Xinglong,栖 Yun, and Saddle Mountains is projected onto Taibai Spring. Visitors can linger here, enjoy tea and wine, sing songs and compose poems, anything is appropriate. The four mountains have many white clouds, and the white clouds are endless. Taibai Spring is the best place to view the clouds. To visit Xinglong Mountain, one must go to Taibai Spring. Speaking of famous sites, there is only the small stone stele inscribed with "Taibai Spring" by President Yu Youren.

In short, the greatest feature of Xinglong and栖 Yun Mountains is their lush forests, with ancient cedars and pines that take several people to embrace, visible everywhere. Between the two peaks is a clear stream with a rapid current, and a beautiful reclining bridge across the stream is especially rich in poetic and picturesque charm. This is not only a famous mountain of the Northwest, but it would also be worthy of any of China's famous mountains. And all of its forms are very similar to Green City Mountain, but the aesthetic pattern of the entire mountain structure is even better than that of Green City Mountain. Traveling from Lanzhou by car, a visit can be made leisurely in one day.
