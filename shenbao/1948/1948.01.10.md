First, the reports listed on the agenda were read: Draft amendment to the International Civil Aviation Convention; seven cases including the agreement on unused parts of Sino-American Lend-Lease materials and other loan contracts; the agreement between China and the United States for the use of funds stipulated in Section 1 of Article 6(2) of the "Surplus War Property Sales Agreement"; the handling of the proposals of the 12th meeting of the National Political Council's resident committee; adjusting the customs duties rate to be implemented ahead of schedule on December 28, 1947, reducing the fisheries and agricultural customs duties rate to 100,000 yuan, and temporarily postponing the adjustment of the customs duties rate in each case; the method for closing the national treasury revenue and expenditure for the 36th year; the method for pre-appropriating various economic expenses for the 37th year. Next, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on the latest diplomatic situation. Then, the proposals were discussed: The proposal to adjust the treatment of civil and military personnel was resolved to be passed in accordance with the review opinions of the Special Review Committee. The general overview of the central government's revenue and expenditure budget for the first half of the 37th year was resolved to be passed in accordance with the review opinions of the Special Review Committee. The opinion case of the Political Review Committee's report on reviewing the dispute over the legislative principles of the draft "Organizational Law of the Doctoral Degree Evaluation Committee" and the "Detailed Rules for the Doctoral Degree Examination" was resolved to be passed in accordance with the review opinions. The proposal to designate Beiping as a co-capital was resolved to be passed. Other multiple financial budget proposals related to various agencies were all passed, and the meeting adjourned at 1 p.m.

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The treatment of civil and military personnel will be partially based on the cost of living index starting in January. This proposal was passed at the State Council meeting on the 9th. Two other important proposals were also passed: one was the central government's general budget, and the other was the draft method for changing the Construction Special Donation to the Relief Special Donation. In addition, the following three financial proposals were also passed: A. The direct tax on profitable enterprises, which in the past was collected based on the profit amount of the previous year, has now been decided to adopt a pre-payment method starting this year. B. The amount of commodity tax collected, which in the past was evaluated once every three months, has now been changed to be evaluated once a month. C. Local finance will be based on self-sufficiency in this year.

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The proposal to designate Beiping as a co-capital was passed at the State Council meeting on the 9th. This proposal was initiated by Gu Mengyu, Speaker of the Beiping Provisional Council, and Xu Huidong, Deputy Speaker, who telegraphed the National Government to instruct the Executive Yuan to review it. After review by the Ministries of Interior and National Defense, it was believed that Beiping, as the former capital of our country, is the hub of politics, military, culture, and transportation in North China. At a time when the country is facing multiple crises and the treacherous bandits are rebelling, the provinces of North China have long suffered from poison, and the people are eagerly looking forward to the central government. Now that Xi'an and Chongqing have been designated as co-capitals, the importance of Beiping is no less than those two places. Therefore, this opinion is put forward, requesting the National Government to adopt it to maintain the morale of the people. It was passed after discussion at the State Council meeting on the 9th. The opinions put forward by the Beiping Council are roughly as follows: A. North China is the birthplace of our Chinese nation, where we can observe the Northeast and threaten the Jiangnan region. B. Beiping controls the iron and steel industry of North China, holding the hub of transportation, materials, and military mobilization in North China, which is the only base for implementing the suppression of the rebellion.

The Significance of Raising Relief Special Donations Lies in Equalizing Social Wealth

Spokesman of the Ministry of Finance Talks to Reporters

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The merits and demerits of raising relief special donations will be launched in the short term, and all the proceeds will be used to provide relief to disaster victims. This is the statement made by the spokesman of the Ministry of Finance to reporters after the State Council passed the Relief Special Donation proposal. He also declared that the government will allocate 500 billion yuan as soon as possible for disaster relief funds to cooperate with the donation. Regarding the fundraising of relief special donations, he specifically put forward three major significances to explain it: A. The rich pay to equalize social wealth. B. It can benefit refugees to achieve the purpose of social relief. C. It can be used to promote and show the noble morality of human disaster relief and care. A certain person did not agree with the Ministry of Finance's explanation and said: The Ministry of Finance will fully cooperate with the Ministry of Social Affairs to promote it under the leadership of the chairman of the supervisory committee, and will use various publicity methods when necessary to ensure that this matter can be promoted.

Director Dong Xianguang Talks About the Characteristics of the General Budget Proposal

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th) Director said: The budget proposal passed by the State Council on the 9th has several characteristics. First, after the implementation of constitutional government, the government's policy guidelines may need to be changed to some extent, so this budget is only applicable for half a year. The budget for the second half of the year will be compiled separately by the government reorganized in accordance with the constitution. Second, on the revenue side, various plans for rectifying tax collection, adjusting tax rates, and stepping up the disposal of materials were put forward at the same time to greatly increase the national treasury revenue. After thorough research and careful calculation, the listed revenue numbers are all reliable. The ratio of the total revenue of more than 58 trillion yuan to the total expenditure of 96 trillion yuan for the regular and special parts is 61%, which is quite close to the ratio of the national treasury revenue in the best year of financial situation before the war. Third, on the expenditure side, in addition to the current necessary expenses, which have been approved as proposed, all funds that may occur in the future or may be increased due to price changes have been widely considered, referring to past situations, predicting future trends, and generously estimating and approving a large amount of reserves. Fourth, this budget is divided into ordinary and special parts. All expenses required for general regular finance, business, debt, and regular military preparation are listed as ordinary expenditures. Temporary income such as special tax revenue and property sales are used for downsizing, and the shortfall is raised by other means.

Draft General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy

Sent to the Legislative Yuan for Review

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The draft general rules for provincial and county (city) autonomy were submitted to the National Government after being passed by the political affairs meeting on December 9 last year, and then transferred to the Legal System and Political Affairs Committees for review. The review report was submitted, and the State Council meeting on the morning of the 9th discussed it in detail based on the review report. All the committee members spoke, and finally resolved two points: 1. The item "Completion of land registration in four areas" in Article 6 of the original draft cannot be completed urgently and should be deleted. The other items are in line with the constitution and will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. 2. The Executive Yuan will immediately draft various regulations related to provincial and county autonomy, such as election laws at all levels. In order to actively promote autonomy, in view of the current situation in our country, when provincial and county autonomy is implemented, there must be considerable preparation. Therefore, during the preparation stage from the implementation of the constitution to the implementation of provincial and county autonomy, the Executive Yuan will formulate innovation methods for the provincial and county system, the relationship between the provincial and county governments and councils, and the financial revenue and expenditure system. During the meeting, the legislative principles proposed by the Executive Yuan were also put forward and it was decided to send them to the Legislative Yuan for review together.

### Measures for Adjusting the Treatment of Civil and Military Personnel

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The measures for adjusting the treatment of civil and military personnel are as follows: 1. Salaries are all based on 30 yuan as the base and paid according to the cost of living index. For salaries above 31 yuan, one-tenth is calculated according to the cost of living index. The cost of living index compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics is the standard. The country is divided into five regions, and the salaries of military officers are calculated according to the cost of living index in the Nanjing area, adjusted once every three months. Starting this month, a trial run will be conducted according to the cost of living index for December of the 36th year, and improvements will be reviewed and improved in the future depending on the national treasury's financial resources and the actual situation at that time. 2. State-owned enterprises and institutions should strictly abide by the regulations. 3. The remaining funds for salaries and cost of living allowances of various agencies will be transferred to the employee welfare expenses of the respective agencies, and the method will be cancelled starting in January of the 37th year. 4. Other related matters such as the salaries of soldiers, public servants, technicians, police officers, the food allowance for publicly-funded students, and special allowances for teachers will be referred to the Executive Yuan for re-examination. 5. The cost of living allowances for civil and military agencies will be reduced by 5% per month starting in February until it is stopped in June, and 25% of the subsidies that should have been issued will be reduced. The agencies themselves will consider how to streamline the organization or downsize the institutions or eliminate redundant personnel. 6. The Executive Yuan will determine the implementation methods of this proposal.

### Our Delegation to the United States Next Week

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Announced the List of Experts Yesterday; American Business Community Launches Aid to China Movement

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) Regarding the dispatch of a technical delegation to the United States to discuss US aid to China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following announcement on the 9th: As a result of discussions between the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US State Department, the Chinese government is now sending a delegation to Washington to exchange views on issues related to US aid to China. The Chinese government has also appointed former Central Bank Governor Bei Zuyi to lead the delegation, and has also appointed Ministry of Foreign Affairs Advisor Li Gan, Transportation Department Road Administration Division Assistant Hong Shen, Chen Liangfu, Chief Representative of the Syngen Committee's US Representative Office, and monetary expert Zhu Baozhen to assist Bei.

The delegation is scheduled to fly to the United States from Shanghai on the 14th of this month. Li had previously attended the Manila Far East Economic Commission and then traveled to the United States, and Chen was originally in the United States and is now residing in Washington. According to this base delegation, it was originally scheduled to be led by Yu Dawei and Bei Zuyi, but Yu's duties as head of the Ministry of Transportation were too heavy, and his mother was critically ill and unable to leave, so he cancelled the trip. However, according to authoritative sources, Yu may still travel to the United States in the future, but the timing will be when the US aid issue is ripe.

(Central News Agency, Washington, 8th) The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee today asked Secretary of State Marshall to submit an estimate of the cost of the aid to China plan to the congress as soon as possible.

(Associated Press, New York, 8th) Business people with interests in China in the United States decided at a meeting of the US Far East Industrial and Commercial Association on the 8th to launch a large-scale movement in Washington to provide appropriate aid to China immediately. Dr. Kong Xiangxi, former Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, then gave a speech to more than 600 members and guests. Kong warned: "Our country's resources are now exhausted. If the United States does not provide assistance, our country may experience even greater hardship." Kong attacked the CCP's rebellion, saying: "If the Communist Party only wants political rights, no one can criticize it, but armed rebellion, which damages the integrity of the country militarily, economically, and socially, should be resisted by the government."

US Policy Towards China

The Evolution of the Past Year

(Associated Press, Washington, 9th) This week a year ago, Marshall's mediation of the Chinese civil war failed and he returned home in frustration, issuing a statement of "calamity for both sides," denouncing both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for obstructing a peaceful resolution. President Truman issued a statement on China policy on December 18, 1946, which Marshall emphasized in his statement, saying that unless Chairman Chiang "expands his government" to accommodate "more liberals," the United States would have no way to aid China.

However, today, as Secretary of State, Marshall is instructing his subordinates to draft a long-term plan for the United States to aid China's reconstruction with US$300 million, as he proposed in November. This explains the evolution of US policy towards China.

After Marshall returned to China on January 7 last year, the official US position was to let the Kuomintang and the Communist Party fight for several months. When they were unable to eat, the opportunity for cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to form a coalition government would be ripe. Officials believed that neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party was strong enough to achieve a decisive victory, which would inevitably lead to concerns about negotiations. However, they now admit that their estimates were wrong, which benefited the Communist Party. A significant change in the US attitude towards China occurred in July this year, when Truman sent Wedemeyer to China to investigate the situation in order to determine how to aid China. At the same time, the US Congress passed a resolution to provide China with US$27.7 million in relief supplies after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In some respects, the August 24 statement explained that the Wedemeyer statement closed the door to aid to China, but well-informed sources said that the main purpose of the statement was to strengthen Chairman Chiang's power to eradicate certain reactionaries within the Kuomintang. After Wedemeyer returned to Washington, he submitted a report to Truman and Marshall. Because its contents mainly discussed China's weaknesses and the implications of US policy towards China for the Soviet Union, it has not yet been made public. However, the report recommended massive aid to China, including military assistance to Chairman Chiang.

Although the situation in China is extremely complex and opinions vary, at the beginning of the new year, it is clear that the United States has decided to provide aid to China similar to that given to Greece, France, and Italy.

### Implementation Measures for the Economic Plan; Draft of the Commercial Part Formulated

Encourage Exports; Trial Run of Barter Trade with Foreign Countries

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The draft implementation measures for the commercial part of the economic reform plan have been formulated. The draft has detailed provisions for encouraging exports in domestic and international trade, and conducting trial runs of barter trade with foreign countries. The Full Economic Commission has scheduled a discussion at its regular meeting on the 15th. The main points are recorded as follows: Original Plan 1. Develop domestic trade: Urge enterprises to reoccupy fixed funds and absorb new funds. The exchange of materials in various economic zones in the country should be formulated into a general plan in coordination with transportation, finance, and tax regulations, and put into practice. Strengthen the cooperation and joint operation system for the production and sales of domestic goods. Except for war or other necessities that are stipulated by the central government or approved by the central government, local governments shall not restrict the export of goods or levy special taxes. All agencies and state-owned public goods shall be limited to domestic goods. Foreign goods shall not be transported and sold unless they cannot be produced domestically.

Original Plan 2. Restrict imported goods: The current import and export management system should continue to be implemented. Adopt a barter trade system as much as possible for the raw materials and production tools that must be imported. For similar items that can be manufactured domestically, those that can attack domestic needs are prohibited from import, and those that still need to be supplied with a portion of foreign goods should reduce the import quota as much as possible. Prohibit the import of luxury goods and other unnecessary items, and prohibit their sale on the market within a time limit. Provide as much support as possible for the development of businesses that offset imports.

Original Plan 3. Encourage export business: The principle of foreign exchange incentive management methods should continue to be applied to facilitate export trade, but when necessary, the government can still purchase and guide unified sales to compete for international markets. The joint transportation system for export goods should be strengthened. For export materials, especially specialty products, a regular loan system should be established from production and manufacturing, inland transportation, transshipment, and sales. The handling banks or companies should moderately relax the conditions, simplify the procedures, and formulate preferential methods for packing, widening, exporting, discounting, and insuring export materials. In order to cooperate with the current foreign exchange situation, certain important items should be designated to promote joint import and export methods, such as exchanging cotton yarn and cotton fabrics for cotton, rice, flax, and flax products in Southeast Asia and India, and exchanging tung oil, bristles, and mineral sands for transportation equipment in the United States, and exchanging leather goods, raw silk, and lace embroidery for cotton, wheat, and wheat flour in the United States, and exchanging soybeans, wool, and Taiwan sugar for agricultural equipment in Japan, and exchanging egg products, wool, department stores, bean cake, and soybean oil for chemicals and industrial equipment in Britain.

Original Plan 4. Trial run of barter trade: The National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office will conduct a trial run of barter trade by national defense cooperative organizations. For export items that belong to agricultural products and animal products, production and marketing cooperatives should be established in the producing areas. For industrial products, cooperative factories or specially-contracted factories should be established. International cooperative organizations can absorb investment in accordance with laws and regulations. When exchanging imported items, if it is necessary to import them first due to seasonal or special reasons, the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office can guarantee that items of equal foreign exchange value will be exported within the specified period before being allowed to import. The National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office can directly apply for import through import and export merchants.

Original Plan 5. Strengthen the organization of guilds: Commercial companies and firms in various places should join the same industry guild. Those who do not join in accordance with the law will be punished. Guilds in various industries should hold meetings on a regular basis and enrich the staff and financial expenses to strengthen the control and investigation and research on members' business operations. Guilds in various industries should formulate common covenants for members to abide by and self-regulate. Formulate laws and regulations on commodity standards and crack down on counterfeit and inferior products. Strengthen the commodity inspection work of the same industry and government agencies. Promote the commercial accounting system and promulgate special laws to bring commercial accounts into line.

There is only one China National Aviation Corporation flight per week on the Shanghai-Nanking-Zhengzhou-Xian-Lanchow route. Due to insufficient tonnage, airmail (letters, postcards, airmail newspapers) to Lanchow and other places cannot always be cleared. Although the Shanghai-Shaanxi route can be used to forward mail via Shaanxi, air transport from Shaanxi to Dihua is also difficult, hence the slight delay in airmail to Lanchow.

British Cabinet Reviews Foreign Policy Based on Bevin's New Plan; Strengthening Ties with the United States to Confront the Soviet Union. [Central News Agency, London, 8th] The British Cabinet held a lengthy meeting this morning, chaired by Prime Minister Attlee, to discuss Britain's future foreign policy in the changing international situation. Foreign Secretary Bevin, fully recovered, attended and presented two confidential reports for the Cabinet's discussion. Although Downing Street did not issue a formal statement, it is understood that one of the two documents presented by Bevin was a review of the general international situation following the failure of last month's London Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the other [omitted character] outlined Britain's future foreign policy. It is expected that Attlee and Bevin will both make important statements on foreign policy during the foreign policy debate in the House of Commons on January 23.

[United Press, London, 8th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin presented a revised plan for global foreign policy to the Cabinet today, including areas where the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union conflict around the world. If this plan is formally adopted, it will mean that the Labor government has completely abandoned maintaining a mediating balance between the United States and the Soviet Union and has fully embraced supporting United States policy. British diplomats have been drafting a new plan since the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on December 15. This matter has been kept extremely secret until now. However, sources in the senior British officialdom say that the plan includes policies for every part of the world where the Western powers encounter the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources believe that the plan includes the following points:

"German Policy" Britain will cooperate with the United States in every way. To this end, Britain will strive to abide by the scope of the Potsdam Agreement in order to avoid giving the Soviet Union any excuse.
"Greek Policy" In order to maintain the Greek government, prevent communist pressure, and liberate Greece, Britain will maintain close ties with the United States so that the Greek government can better represent the entire Greek people. Britain may, if necessary, reinforce its 5,000 troops that have not yet withdrawn from Greece, even if this provokes fierce opposition from the left wing of the Labor Party.
"Middle East Policy" Britain will strengthen its position in every way to counter the Soviet Union. Britain will also seek to mitigate major conflicts between Arabs and Jews when its mandate over Palestine ends on May 15 of this year.
"Western European Policy" Britain is determined to play a key role in the Marshall Plan, but detailed plans cannot be drawn up until the divided attitude of the United States Congress is clarified.
"Far East Policy" Britain will follow the policy of the United States on Japan and its peace treaty.

Britain's Future German Policy: Efforts to Promote the Economic Unity of All of Germany; the Door to Four-Power Agreement Remains Open. [Reuters, London, 9th] Reliable sources say: Foreign Secretary Bevin presented the Cabinet with a detailed report on the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 9th and its effects on Britain's future German policy. The British Cabinet's examination of German policy comes at a time when the British and American authorities in Germany announced measures for West German autonomy yesterday. Therefore, the Cabinet must take into account the situation that will be caused by the concentration of administrative power in the British and American zones in Frankfurt during the examination. The Soviet response to the measures for West Germany announced by the British and Americans yesterday is full of criticism. TASS reports denounced the proposal as aiming to disintegrate Germany and full of serious consequences for the German people. Bevin stated clearly in the House of Commons when reporting on the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference that Britain would never close the door to a four-power agreement. It is expected that Bevin's report to the Cabinet will still take this as its principle.

Diplomatic observers all believe that the central question at present is whether the Soviet Union will use the new administrative measures in West Germany as an excuse to withdraw from the Berlin Allied Control Council and split Germany. Sources here believe that there are several reasons why the Soviet Union might be willing to split Germany:

The Soviet Union's recent propaganda in Berlin vigorously asserts that the days of the Western Allied delegations in the Allied Control Council are numbered;
The Soviet security authorities intend to close the gap in Berlin in order to completely isolate the Soviet Union from West Germany;
It is rumored that the Soviet Union is stepping up preparations to establish a new administrative system in the Soviet zone.

Those who hold the opposite view believe that the Soviet Union is confident that its political power can be extended to West Germany, so it is still unwilling to finally split Germany. Moreover, the Soviet Union has announced that it wants to use the Foreign Ministers' Conference as an institution to prepare for the peace treaty with Japan, so it is expected that it will not want to break up the Berlin Allied Control Council soon. If this is the case, then Britain's German policy will be guided by the following two paths:

Cooperate with the United States to promote the economic recovery of the British-American merged zone, while giving Germans greater opportunities to take responsibility;
Continue to work to promote the economic unity of all of Germany.
The most concrete measures that Bevin will propose are to increase trade between western Germany and eastern Germany and Eastern European countries, and to reach an agreement on currency reform in the four zones as soon as possible.

West German Autonomy Can Be Implemented Next Month. [Reuters, Frankfurt, 8th] General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army, who presented the six-point proposal for political autonomy in West Germany yesterday, said today that German officials are generally satisfied with his proposal. He said at a press conference that the proposal he put forward could be submitted in writing within ten days for study by Allied and German officials. He hopes that some parts of the plan can be implemented in February. German officials meeting in Frankfurt have accepted the proposal to double the number of members of the Anglo-American Economic Commission and agreed that each state should send two representatives to form a legislative assembly, called the State Council, which may exercise its right to vote on resolutions passed by the Economic Commission within fourteen days [omitted character]. According to British Commander-in-Chief Robertson [omitted character] Sen said that the establishment of a joint administrative body in the merged zone was motivated by two factors: first, to attempt to quickly overcome the difficulties of joint occupation; second, to strengthen cooperation between Britain and the United States. Clay also denied that the Frankfurt resolution was the prelude to the merger of the three zones of West Germany. He forcefully argued that Britain and the United States had no intention of making Frankfurt the capital of West Germany, but only the headquarters of the economic and financial institutions of the merged zone.

The Soviet Occupation Zone Sings a Counter-Tune. [Reuters, Berlin, 8th] Well-informed sources say: The prime ministers of the states in the Soviet zone will meet in Thuringia at the beginning of the month to discuss the [omitted character] of the reorganization of the administration of the Anglo-American zone in West Germany proposed by Britain and the United States. It is also learned that the executive committee of the [omitted character] National Congress of the German People under the auspices of the Soviet Union is also expected to be established before the end of the month. It is generally believed that the German National Congress of the People is the prototype of the Soviet zone parliament, and the executive committee may be the foundation of the East German government.

France Protests to England. [Our News] London 9th Broadcast: Paris News, French Official News, France made hard protest against the establishment of a joint political institution by British and the United States in the German occupation zone. And declared that some point in the suggestion were not welcomed by the French side.

US Senate asks Marshall to quickly submit the total amount of foreign aid; Douglas advocates that aid to Europe should be given as a gift. [Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee today asked Secretary of State Marshall to submit to the committee as soon as possible an estimate of the total cost of foreign aid, from this day fourteen months to the next fifteen months, including the cost of the army's occupation. The Foreign Relations Committee made this request today at the end of its review of the European Recovery Program. Chairman Vandenberg asked Marshall to submit a complete table of differences for the following items requested by the State Department:

European Recovery Program (approximately US$6.8 billion)
Aid to China Program.
Further Aid to Greece and Turkey Program.
US Occupation Costs in Germany, Austria, Japan and Korea.

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] The US Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, stated his views on the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 8th. He believes that 80% of the aid stipulated in the Marshall Plan should be given as gifts. In the current rough estimate, only 20% to 40% can be used as loans requiring repayment. Douglas also said that in the first fifteen months of aid to Europe, the aid provided by Latin America and Canada will be worth approximately US$650 million. If they cannot provide it, the amount borne by the United States must be increased. Marshall presented his views before Douglas's presentation. He said that if the European Recovery Plan can stabilize the economic situation in Western Europe and West Germany, the Soviet Union may sign a peace treaty with Germany in accordance with conditions acceptable to the Western Allies. If the aid to Europe process is firm, it can enable Europe to engage in cooperation. It is not yet time to determine the United States' final attitude towards Germany. Establishing another government in West Germany is not appropriate at this time, but the French zone in Germany will gradually establish close relations with the Anglo-American zone, and it is possible to establish an Anglo-American-French merged zone. The current urgent task is to first stabilize the situation in West Germany. It is believed that the European Recovery Program can establish a situation that can produce an agreement, and in fact, there is already a strong trade agreement between Eastern and Western Europe.

US House Foreign Affairs Committee will review the Aid to Europe case; Marshall will still attend to testify. [Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] The US House Foreign Affairs Committee will meet to review the United States' [omitted character] original policy towards the entire world after the war. This policy will not be limited to Europe. The House Foreign Affairs Committee decided to expand its scope of review in today's executive meeting to include regions of the world other than Europe. When Marshall appears before the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the 12th of this month to testify, the European Recovery Program and the Hurt Act, which advocates that a separate agency implement the aid program, will be studied first by the committee. The committee said that plans for other parts of the world will not be considered until the Aid to Europe program is completed.

Regarding the rumor of resigning over the debate on Aid to Europe, Marshall denied it. [Our News] New York 9th Broadcast: Washington News, rumor says that if the Aid to Europe plan is not approved, the Secretary of State will resign. Marshall denied this at today's reception, believing that this statement is completely untrue. At the same time, the US Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, told Congress today that there are only two paths to follow regarding Europe. One is to implement the recovery plan, and the other is for "Europe to be conquered by totalitarian politics." The impact will force our country to greatly expand its military equipment. If the Aid to Europe plan is approved, it will likely be presided over by Douglas Yun.

When asked about this by the British representative to the United Nations, Peling [omitted character], he said that he had not seen this report, but he personally believed that the name "non-aggression treaty" was not very pleasant.

Where will this money come from? Taft criticized that in Truman's message, he actually wanted to make all the ghosts of the New Deal resurrect.

Rumor of Stalin's Death Spreads Around the World; Moscow Remains Silent.

[Our News] In the past two days, the city's gold bill black market has become increasingly rampant. The authorities are determined to thoroughly eliminate this and have already formulated a comprehensive plan. A large-scale arrest operation was launched yesterday, and it was completed by midnight. The arrests will continue today to ensure that everyone is caught. The authorities have a blacklist of hundreds of people engaged in the gold bill black market in the city. Yesterday, many gold bill black market operations were raided according to the blacklist, and the amount of gold bills confiscated and confiscated has reached hundreds of billions or more.

Mayor Wu, Director of the Financial Administration Bureau Li Lixia, and Vice President of the Central Bank [omitted character] Gong Yun, jointly held a press conference yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM. First, Director Li reported as follows: The gold bill black market has been very calm in the past month, but unexpectedly, it suddenly became volatile starting the day before yesterday, especially yesterday. The Municipal Government has always attached great importance to the issue of cracking down on the gold bill black market and is determined to give it a major blow. After three months of research, the location and methods of the city's gold bill black market operators have been identified, and they have been included in the list.

North and South Markets Dump White Rice, Grain Trading Gradually Normalizes. Authorities Resolve to Severely Punish Rice Merchants Who Raise Prices.

[Our Report] In response to the rising rice prices of recent days, the authorities decided to adopt a policy to suppress prices. Yesterday, the North and South Rice Market Management Committees each supplied 7,500 piculs of rice to the market, priced at 1.35 million yuan per picul, for a total of 15,000 piculs. This rice was all high-quality Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan white japonica thin paddy. The market atmosphere eased considerably, and grain trading gradually normalized. Yesterday, the registered arrivals of grain in the North and South markets, when transacted, all complied with the authorities' regulations, not exceeding the maximum price of 1.35 million yuan within seven days.

Another report: Yesterday, the retail price of rice still reached around 1.55 million yuan in some rice shops. According to the prescribed retail price, it should be the market price plus 6% legal profit, and about 30,000 yuan for cartage and commission per dan, so each dan should only sell for about 1.46 million yuan. The authorities, after investigating these rice shops that raise prices, have decided to severely punish them. Furthermore, on the 8th, the North Market arbitrarily raised the rice price to 1.5 million yuan for transactions. The Social Affairs Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate and found that three rice shops purchased at high prices on the morning of the 8th and then raised prices for sale, with each shop transacting hundreds of dan, causing chaos in the market on the 8th. The Social Affairs Bureau has confirmed the facts, and Director Wu has decided to severely punish them according to the Regulations for Suppressing Rebellion.

The China Trading Bureau ordered 43,000 tons of rice last year, which has been arriving at ports since the middle of last month. The Niuzhuang vessel with 2,300 tons, the Nanchang vessel with 2,000 tons, and the Haichen vessel with 8,800 tons have all arrived successively, totaling 13,000 tons. Expected to arrive within days are the Changxing vessel carrying 7,000 tons and the Manila vessel carrying 1,000 tons. The remaining amount has also been arranged for transportation by ships and is expected to arrive completely within the month. Flour Digestion Is Smooth; Oil Market Supply Increases.

Yesterday, a total of over 11,800 piculs of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets. Grain market transactions were extremely sparse, with only white yuan indica rice seeing some activity. The market trend was not very volatile. Flour digestion was very good, and prices rose again by 20,000 yuan. Wheat bran sales turned sluggish, trending towards flatness. Bean cake factories remained firm, continuing to rise by over 10,000 yuan. Soybean buyers, both oil factories and others, were receptive, and sellers held firm, rising gradually by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

Mung beans were competitively purchased by both North and South merchants, soaring upwards, galloping by 100,000 yuan. Adzuki beans arrived insufficiently to meet sales, skyrocketing by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Cowpeas saw active buyer interest, surging by over 100,000 yuan. Broad beans arrived sparsely and sold briskly, galloping by 100,000 yuan. Red sorghum was stable in the north, with distilleries not eager, maintaining a firm tone.

Corn, under the aggressive acquisition in Qingdao, saw another sharp increase of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were aggressively sought by Guang merchants, and local streets followed suit, continuing to surge wildly, reaching new peaks, a dramatic increase of over 100,000 yuan. Sesame also rose with other commodities, with black sesame adding 5 yuan and white sesame soaring by 100,000 yuan.

The oil market saw increased supply from factories, maintaining balance. Soybean oil was initially firm but then weakened, showing a slight softening. Raw oil saw tightening at collection time, with Ningbo merchants inquiring, rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Clear oil was flat, while vegetable and sesame oil added slightly by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Flour Association Requests Implementation of Wheat Loans and Import of One Million Tons of Foreign Wheat.

The Flour Industry Association of the Four Districts, due to the sharp rise in flour prices following rice prices and the depleted wheat reserves in producing areas, and with the equipment of flour mills in various districts mostly unable to be fully utilized, has provided opinions to the National Economic Council, requesting adoption to improve the current environment. The following is a summary:

Raw Materials: The flour industry, with factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces alone, has an annual output of 70 million bags, requiring approximately 2.4 million tons of wheat annually. According to pre-war domestic wheat production, 1.5 million tons of raw materials could be supplied, sufficient for only seven months of production, requiring imports of foreign wheat to make up the shortfall. However, at that time, the national food supply was barely adequate. After the war, due to local unrest, high fertilizer costs, and transportation obstacles, production declined. This year's wheat, available for purchase, is no more than 600,000 tons, sufficient for only three and a half months. Wheat typically enters the market in its peak season from July to September. By the end of December this year, the quantity purchased by various factories (including the Grain Department) was only over 300,000 tons. Except for a portion stored by the Grain Department, factories, due to financial constraints, milled as they purchased, with little storage. To stabilize the people's food supply, the government should comprehensively plan and find ways to import one million tons of foreign wheat.

Capital: The flour industry's financial foundation was destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, to cooperate with the government's food policy, businesses did not have operational freedom, and 18 companies were unable to sustain themselves and closed. The main reason was the inability to obtain loans. Even with loans, it was ineffective. The government should implement a wheat loan program, increasing capital by at least 160 billion national currency, so that each factory can purchase 500,000 dan of wheat to supplement the people's food supply.

Production: According to the Association's statistics for 1946, the annual output was approximately 17 million bags. According to machine equipment, the annual output could be 70 million bags. Currently, the output is less than one-fourth of the total production capacity. Furthermore, the peak production periods for each factory are mostly from July to October, which is also the peak season for wheat entering the market. After this, it gradually decreases. Currently, due to insufficient raw materials, insufficient electricity, and insufficient capital, the peak season cannot produce large quantities, and the off-season is even more difficult to sustain. The Association's survey in August of this year showed that the highest output for each factory was only 3 million bags. The peak season is only this much. The future is self-evident. The authorities should set a policy early to ensure the people's food supply.

Government Bonds Rise Again, Foreign Stocks Turn Weak.

Government bonds created another miracle yesterday. The Unified C bonds opened at 49,500 yuan in the morning, rising from 48,400 yuan to a new high of 52,600 yuan, before settling slightly. 5 million yuan was traded. Compared to the previous close, A and B bonds rose by 3,000 yuan, C bonds rose by 4,800 yuan, and D and E bonds each rose by 400 yuan.

Foreign Stocks Initially Rose, Then Weakened. Hong Kong and Shanghai Electric first shrank to 2.4 yuan, then rose to 2.8 yuan. The environment weakened again. Ewo Silk fell from a new high of 710,000 yuan, declining to 620,000 yuan at closing. Securities firms initially rose, then sold. Foreign merchants bought. Compared to the previous close, Tramway and Telephone were stable, Paper fell by 10%, Wheelock, Real Estate, Ewo Brewery, Steel, and Rubber each fell by 0.5%, and the rest declined slightly.

Investigation of Returned Checks Proves Effective; Same-Day Use of Checks Will Be Strictly Prohibited. The Shanghai Financial Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, to thoroughly eliminate speculation, has dispatched a large number of auditors since yesterday to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the operations of banks and trading houses, especially focusing on investigating returned checks and prohibiting same-day use of checks. It is reported that both have been effective, and the number of returns has indeed decreased. The latter will be strictly enforced and punished according to law, in the hope of suppressing prices and stabilizing finance in the shortest possible time.

China Trust Issues Notice to Purchase Imported Paper.

The issue of purchasing imported paper with self-provided foreign exchange has been finalized. The China Trust Bureau has prepared for the purchasing work. The Bureau has issued a notice to paper importers to handle the purchase. Furthermore, paper prices in the city have soared. For example, newsprint was 1.4 million yuan per ream on Monday this week and over 2 million yuan yesterday. Heavyweight woodfree paper was 80,000 yuan per pound on Monday this week and is now 130,000 yuan, all soaring sharply, greatly affecting cultural undertakings. After the purchase is completed, the authorities will sell to increase market supply and suppress prices.

Cotton Merchants Have Mostly Registered; China Textile Construction Will Purchase According to Market Price. The Yarn Control Committee Holds Its First Committee Meeting.

[Our Report] The Yarn Control Committee is scheduled to hold its first committee meeting at 3:00 PM today (the 10th), chaired by Chairman Yuan, with all committee members and directors attending. The Committee received an order from the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday, adding Gu Baochang, Director of the Industrial Affairs Department, and Dai Dajun, Director of the Control Department, as members of the Committee, bringing the total to seven, sufficient to meet the required number. It is reported that the meeting today will discuss the implementation rules for various management items and the organizational regulations for offices in various locations.

Furthermore, according to Chairman Yuan yesterday, regarding cotton registration, almost all cotton merchants in the city have registered. The Committee has notified China Textile Construction Corporation that it can purchase cotton according to market price from today. The required funds have been transferred to China Textile, and cotton merchants can directly contact China Textile. In the future, the Committee can purchase cotton whenever cotton merchants bring it to the city. He hopes that cotton merchants and factories will sincerely cooperate with the Committee so that all matters can be resolved.

[Another Report] According to Deputy General Manager Wu of China Textile Construction Corporation, the Company has not yet received an official document from the Yarn Control Committee entrusting the Company to purchase registered cotton from cotton merchants. The purchase funds have also not been transferred. However, it is believed that it will be transferred within a day or two, and the purchase will then be handled. The purchase price will be determined by the Yarn Control Committee. China Textile is responsible for inspecting cotton samples, grading them, and then purchasing them at the verified market price.

Cotton Yarn Negotiated Prices Adjusted Again; 20s Yarn Changed to 35.5 Million Yuan. Yarn Control Continues to Sell in the Market Yesterday.

[Our Report] The Yarn Control Committee adjusted the negotiated prices of cotton yarn again yesterday, with 20s yarn changed to 35.5 million yuan. Other counts of yarn were set proportionally and with reference to market prices. The Committee continued to sell cotton yarn in the market yesterday. 110 applicants applied to purchase 619 lots. As a result, 68 applicants were approved to purchase 350 lots, equivalent to 460 lots of 20s yarn. The selling price for 20s Heavenly Maiden Golden Rooster was 38.1 million yuan, Flying Boat 37 million yuan, Golden Double Horse Three Sails Double Happiness 36.8 million yuan, Golden Ingot Red Bee 36.5 million yuan, 6s Deputy Sunlight 16.5 million yuan, 32s Blue Phoenix 49 million yuan, 40s 58 million yuan, and 42s Double Strand 63 million yuan.

Furthermore, China Textile Construction Corporation also sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 1,241 lots, equivalent to 2,066 lots of 20s yarn. A total of 531 applicants applied, and the selling price remained unchanged.

Cotton Cloth Market Weakens Again.

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market weakened because of the excessive rise in recent days, with buyers taking a wait-and-see approach. Speculators profited and sold, and the market showed oversupply. Prices frequently declined. Finally, the price of 40s Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 2.35 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also declined, ranging from 400,000 to 2 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market opened with uncertainty due to rumors of a ban on the movement of yarn and cloth. Furthermore, China Textile Construction Corporation supplied a large quantity the day before, and funds were ample. Some firms experienced tight positions, and there was a lot of reselling in the market. In addition, speculators sold high-priced goods, and buyers also came to settle accounts. Dyeing factories countered by selling. By the end of the day, the price of fine cloth such as Dragon Head Five Blessings fell by 80,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Throughout the day, raw blue cloth and native-spun cloth were firm and strong due to increased dye and labor costs. Other cloths seemed to be flat and weak.

The current cotton market, since the announcement of the unified purchase and distribution method by the Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Management Committee, has been marked by doubt and reluctance to trade on both sides, and the market has been stagnant for a long time. After days of negotiation between cotton merchants and the authorities, cotton is still allowed to move freely in the city, so the same industry transaction revived, slightly has the business. Yesterday Market price (Sima scale) transaction price was 7 million yuan per dan, Hankou fine velvet 6.5 million yuan, and there was no news of other transactions.

Crackdown on Nylon Stockings Decided to Start with Registration.

[Our Report] After the victory, foreign nylon stockings sold well in the city, severely impacting the domestic industry. Relevant industries petitioned the authorities to ban sales to seek salvation. The Municipal Government's Second Economic Conference decided to have the Social Affairs Bureau invite the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss concrete measures. Zhou Weixin, Chief of the Price Management Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Yan Mingsheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, exchanged views at 10:00 AM on the 8th and agreed on three measures:

The scope of prohibited goods is very broad, but nylon stockings will be the initial target.

The Social Affairs Bureau will draft a stock registration form (including name, quantity in stock, cost, current selling price, monthly sales for the past six months, etc., without investigating the source) and order relevant industry associations to complete registration within one month and report to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification.

Selling prices, sales deadlines, and the handling of unsold goods within the deadline will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau after convening the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and relevant industry associations. The above measures have been reported to the Municipal Government and approved for compliance.

Control of Market Interest Rates Must Be Adapted to Local Conditions.

[Our Report] It is reported that the Federation of Money Trade Associations, when convening its inaugural meeting in Beijing, passed a proposal from the Shanghai Money Trade Association, namely that the control of interest rates should consider the financial market conditions in various regions and adapt to local conditions to bring them closer to market interest rates. The meeting also requested the Ministry of Finance to forward a request to the Central Bank to notify its branches in various locations to adopt and implement this. The Ministry of Finance, citing that the "Regulations for the Management of Bank Deposit Interest Rates" stipulate that interbank lending rates and loan interest rates in various regions should be drafted by the local banking and money industry associations and then finally approved by the local branches of the Central Bank, which is consistent with the spirit of the above proposal, has sent a letter to the Central Bank for its consideration. It is now learned that the Central Bank has sent a letter to its branches, instructing them to pay attention to this when approving interest rates in various regions.

Sugar Prices Gradually Increase.

Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained firm, with prices increasing. For example, white sugar rose by another 10% to 5%, red sugar rose by 10% to 8%, green sugar rose by 6% to 4%, and white sugar futures rose by over 100,000 to 670,000 yuan.

Sugar Shipped to Tianjin.

[Our Report] The China Merchants Bureau's Cai vessel sailed to Tianjin yesterday afternoon, carrying over 5,000 packages of sugar, over 500 boxes of cigarettes, and over 400 pieces of yarn and cloth.

Tea Prices Strong.

Since the widespread surge in prices of all goods, the foreign tea market, although in mediocre trading activity, has seen a uniform upward trend in quotations due to the bullish sentiment of holders. As for various domestic sales teas, both local streets and merchant buyers are still receptive, with a tendency to buy whatever is available. However, sellers are also holding firm, so the situation shows an imbalance between supply and demand, and transactions are difficult. Prices, on the other hand, are shining brightly, with solid footing.

Chinese Stocks Recover Briefly; Small Stocks Sequentially Hit Limit Down.

Chinese stocks surged again midway yesterday, but large investors took advantage of the high prices to sell off-market, and Yong Silk fell sharply from new highs of 812 yuan and 820 yuan. Small stocks turned from limit up to limit down, and the environment was unfavorable.

The morning opened with weakness across the board except for Xinyi and Sino-French, which were uniquely strong. Interest prices opened low at 2.1 and 2.55 yuan, and Yong Silk rose to 770 yuan and 778 yuan. Soon, rumors spread that the US dollar exchange rate was high, causing another commotion that pulled it out of the 800 yuan mark, reaching high prices of 812 yuan and 822 yuan. Speculators closed positions, falling to 775 yuan and 778 yuan at closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Xinyi and Huafeng underwear rose to the limit and rebounded, with Xinyi rising by 10%, underwear rising by 5%, Huafeng uniquely flat, Xinhua fell by 50%, and Li'an fell by 10%. Zhabei, Huaxin, Commerce, Xinguangjing, Qin, Sino-French fell by 50%, Yong Silk rose by 50%, and the rest rose and fell slightly. In the forward market, Huafeng rose by 50%, Jingfu fell by 10%, and the rest rose and fell slightly.

The after-market opened and showed no support, falling to 768 yuan and 780 yuan, and once rose to 800 yuan and 810 yuan. After that, the wind turned, and external stimuli assisted, lacking opponents, and the decline was惨厉. Small stocks Xinhua, Sino-French, Jingfu, Qinyu, China Silk, Huaxin, Xinguang, Huafeng, Li'an, Yonggong, and Shunxu hit limit down, and the off-market was even more chaotic, falling to 749 yuan and 755 yuan. The closing price was 752 yuan and 757 yuan. As a result, compared to the last transaction, Yong Silk, Commerce, Li'an, Sino-French, and Xinhua hit limit down, Huaxin rebounded after hitting limit down, Guxiao was a small amount, China Textile and Datong fell by 10%, and the rest rebounded slightly. In the forward market, Jingfu hit limit down, Xinguang and Qinyu each fell by over 10%, and Yong Silk fell slightly. Off-market old stocks were tight and very strong, and Dasheng, China, and China actually rose by over 10%.

Wool Market Sales Weaken.

Wool sales have continued to weaken recently. Both local Qipan Street entrances and exits are clear. Business in men's and women's clothing stores in various districts is also tending to be light. Merchant buyers are lonely in adding purchases, because winter sales have already been ordered, and spring sales are still pending, so business is entering a difficult path. Yesterday, ordinary dyed flannel was mostly shouted at 950,000 to 1.1 million yuan per yard, blended woven flannel was sold at 1.25 million to 1.65 million yuan, Ji Ji was sold at 800,000 to 1.1 million yuan, Haibailong was sold at 1.6 million yuan, and riding breeches were 1.45 million yuan.

Industrial Raw Materials Are Hoarded.

Due to the lack of continued arrivals in the industrial raw material market, and with most of the third-quarter quota goods being imported, demand from all sides is very high, leading to a shortage of spot goods in the market. Industrial manufacturers are eagerly seeking, and those with goods are holding onto them and raising prices, unwilling to sell. The market trend is thriving. Hot-selling goods such as caustic soda and oils and fats are rising even more sharply. The highest price for Yuelai caustic soda was 60 million yuan per barrel, finally settling at 58.5 million yuan. American caustic soda also rose to 56 million yuan. Triangle brand glycerin 50-pound cans were 6.4 million yuan, and other goods also rose, up by 10% to 30-40% compared to the previous.

Literary and Historical Studies: The "Kingly and Hegemonic Ways Combined" of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, by Deng Guangming

There is a story in the "Book of Han, Biography of Emperor Yuan" that says Emperor Yuan was gentle and fond of Confucianism. Seeing that his father, Emperor Xuan, favored officials who used law and legalism and liked to restrain his subordinates with criminal law, and that ministers such as Yang Yun and Gai Kuanrao suffered the misfortune of being killed merely because their words touched upon criticism, Emperor Yuan, during an informal banquet, calmly advised Emperor Xuan, saying:

"Your Majesty uses punishment too harshly; you should employ Confucian scholars."

Unexpectedly, this statement greatly angered Emperor Xuan. Emperor Xuan sternly told his son:

"The Han Dynasty has its own system: it is fundamentally a mixture of the ways of kings and hegemons. How can we rely purely on moral education and use the government of the Zhou Dynasty?..."

Emperor Xuan himself, according to the "Book of Han," on the one hand, "believed in rewarding and punishing without fail, comprehensively examining names and realities," causing "officials of politics, literature, law, and reason to perfect their abilities." On the other hand, he also "lectured on the Six Arts, exceptionally selected outstanding talents, and Xiao Wangzhi, Liangqiu He, Xiahou Sheng, Wei Xuancheng, Yan Pengzu, and Yin Gengshi advanced through Confucian scholarship; Liu Xiang and Wang Bao were distinguished by their writings; generals and ministers such as Zhang Anshi and Zhao Chongguo... administrators of the people such as Huang Ba, Wang Cheng, Xi Sui... Zhang Chang and others all had meritorious achievements and were described by the world." This was truly the most standard approach of "combining the ways of kings and hegemons." As for before Emperor Xuan, among the six reigns of Gao, Hui, Wen, Jing, Wu, and Zhao, the one whose approach was most in line with what Emperor Xuan said about "mixing the ways of kings and hegemons" should be the reign of Emperor Xuan's grandfather, Emperor Wu.

I.

Before ascending the throne, Emperor Wu studied under the Confucian scholar Wang Zang. Naturally, he couldn't help but yearn for the idealized realms of the Five Emperors and the prosperous Three Dynasties envisioned by Confucianism. What he longed for was a world where "manners were refined and commands were carried out, punishments were light and crimes were corrected, the people were harmonious and joyful, political affairs were clearly proclaimed, fresh dew fell, all grains prospered, virtue nourished the four seas, blessings reached the grasses and trees, the three lights were complete, the cold and heat were balanced, he received the blessings of Heaven and the spirits, and his virtue overflowed, extending to the outside world and reaching all living beings." He did not know that this was an ideal state that had never been reached, but only thought that the reason why the Han Dynasty, after seventy years of prosperity, had not yet reached this supreme and beautiful state was because human affairs were still not perfect and the art of governance had not yet fully achieved its potential.

In the early years of the Han Dynasty, after the long period of turmoil at the end of the Qin Dynasty, the court and the people all wanted to rest and do nothing. The Huang-Lao school of thought, advocating inaction and tranquility, became the prevailing scholarship at the time. Emperor Wen favored discussions on criminal law, Emperor Jing did not trust Confucian scholars, and Empress Dou of Emperor Wen especially favored the Huang-Lao school. Therefore, during these reigns, Confucianism was constantly rejected, and the various scholars held official positions but were not consulted and did not advance. The Han Dynasty, ruled for seventy years by these emperors, generals, and ministers who believed in Huang-Lao Taoism, was still in a state of "yin and yang in disarray, atmosphere filled with obstruction, living beings unable to fulfill their potential, the common people not helped, integrity and shame thrown into confusion, the worthy and unworthy mixed together." This was truly immeasurable compared to the ancient, prosperous age that Emperor Wu longed for day and night. Therefore, after Emperor Wu ascended the throne, on the one hand, he was filled with nostalgia for the past; on the other hand, he felt endless disgust and contempt for the current state of politics and society. The Confucian scholars who had always been unsuccessful in politics seized this opportunity to attribute all the bad phenomena in politics and society to "different techniques and strange doctrines," advocating that the status quo be changed, that is, that the systems be changed and the teachings be renewed, which meant that Confucianism must be promoted and all the previous governing techniques must be eliminated. When Emperor Wu first ascended the throne, his grandmother, Empress Dowager Dou, still wielded great power and severely suppressed this movement to restore ancient ways. After Dou's death in the sixth year of Jianyuan (135 BC), Emperor Wu could do as he pleased, and the proposals of these Confucian scholars were gradually implemented.

However, Emperor Wu of the Han was an extremely romantic person, fitting Sima Qian's comment, "He was full of desires inwardly but outwardly practiced benevolence and righteousness." He had a deep affection for the glorious era of the distant past and the vision of great unification eulogized by Confucianism, and he was willing to expand territories, pay homage to the Rong and Di peoples, govern China, and pacify the four barbarians. However, he could not strictly follow the path to governing the country and pacifying the world prescribed by Confucianism. He could not just correct his righteousness without seeking his own interests, just clarify his doctrine without considering his achievements. Achievement and interest were precisely the ultimate goals of Emperor Wu. This was a fundamental difference between Emperor Wu and the Confucian scholars. Because of this fundamental difference, what was manifested in Emperor Wu's employment of people and implementation of policies was necessarily very different from what Confucianism advocated: he could not trust pure Confucian scholars, and he could not fully adopt Confucian techniques. Confucian scholars, Confucian learning, and Confucian techniques were only used by him as objects to decorate the scene and embellish peace. This can be seen particularly clearly in the following matters:

I. Dong Zhongshu's three responses in the examination were highly appreciated by Emperor Wu, but the only ones that were truly implemented were "correcting the calendar and changing the colors of clothing" and "those who are not in the subjects of the Six Arts and the techniques of Confucius, all their paths should be cut off." However, Dong Zhongshu could only serve as a chancellor in a vassal state and was never truly trusted by Emperor Wu.

II. Gongsun Hong, as a Confucian scholar, responded to the selection of virtuous and good scholars and was also known and appreciated by Emperor Wu for his responses, rising from "being recommended and starting as a commoner to becoming prime minister and being enfeoffed as a marquis within a few years." This seems to indicate Emperor Wu's belief in Confucian scholars. However, Gongsun Hong's character was to distort learning to flatter the world and seek advancement. He would rather betray the agreements of his colleagues to cater to Emperor Wu's intentions, but he would never openly argue against Emperor Wu's opinions. To excuse Emperor Wu's extravagant and indulgent behavior, he even shamelessly uttered the slogan "The ruler worries about not being expansive, and the ministers worry about not being frugal." It was because he could abandon the position of a Confucian scholar at any time that he gained Emperor Wu's trust and was able to serve as prime minister and censor for as long as six years.

III. Some of the essayists at the time, such as Sima Xiangru, Zhu Maichen, Mei Gao, and Dongfang Shuo, were most fond of extravagant and flamboyant writing, exaggerating wealth and grandeur, and boasting of prosperous scenes. This was very much in line with Emperor Wu's fondness for greatness and his extravagant and unrestrained nature. Therefore, they were successively favored by Emperor Wu, and he almost felt that he had met everyone too late. These people mostly entered and exited the palace and became close officials, becoming the most trusted literary attendants. Although literary attendants did not occupy an important position in the organization of the government at the time, because they were "always at his side" and often discussed matters with the powerful ministers, and they were able to use their artful words to influence the ministers, they were actually people who truly had a practical effect on influencing state affairs.

Under the auxiliary influence of these Confucian officials and literati, Emperor Wu dismissed the hundred schools of thought, extolled the Six Classics, and recruited talented individuals from across the country. He also "established the Imperial Academy, repaired suburban sacrifices, corrected the calendar, determined the numbers, harmonized music, composed ritual music, established the feng and shan sacrifices, worshiped the hundred gods, and continued the descendants of the Zhou Dynasty," so that even his orders and writings were all "brilliantly commendable." All of this was the entirety of Emperor Wu's actions in the area of the kingly way. In it, we can hardly find which items were closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

II.

That Mr. Gongsun Hong, who started as a Confucian scholar and within a few years rose to become prime minister and be enfeoffed as a marquis, was not only good at distorting learning and flattering the world to seek advancement. According to his biography in the "Book of Han," he was originally a person who "was familiar with the affairs of officials of law and legalism and embellished them with Confucian techniques." This means that Gongsun Hong was outwardly a Confucian scholar, but at heart he was most proficient in criminal law and legalism. The approach of this Mr. Gongsun, whom Emperor Wu trusted most, actually best represented Emperor Wu himself and the entire approach of Emperor Wu's reign. In all places where decoration was needed and empty rhetoric was required, Emperor Wu adopted the doctrines of Confucianism, but in all practical political and criminal measures closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, he entirely adopted the techniques of governance of the legalist school. The Confucian set of claims to "reduce penalties and lighten taxes" was no longer under consideration by Emperor Wu.

Because the early Han Dynasty adopted Huang-Lao's policy of inaction to rest with the people, by the time Emperor Wu ascended the throne, this policy had achieved great results: the people were self-sufficient, and society had reached considerable prosperity. The government also had abundant wealth and goods in its treasury, and the grain in its granaries was piled up. At the same time, however, this doctrine of inaction also cultivated several scourges. The most important of these were: I. Avoiding the use of force against the powerful enemy, the Xiongnu in the north, and instead implementing a policy of marriage alliance, while the Xiongnu continued to insult the Han Dynasty. II. Emperors Wen and Jing tried their best to reduce the taxes and levies on the peasants, sometimes even exempting them for more than a decade. This was originally a policy that benefited the people, but it unexpectedly only benefited the wealthy farmers who owned land. Poor people tilled the land and still had to pay most of their harvests to the landlords every year. As a result, the rich became richer and were able to buy large amounts of land, engaging in unrestrained annexation, and the poor and weak people were further plunged into misery. III. The practice of wandering chivalry, which had been prevalent in society since the Warring States period, also grew in an unhindered state in the early Han Dynasty. These wandering knights were all outlaws who violated prohibitions with violence. They colluded with the relatives of the Han court and the ministers and the vassal kings of the various kingdoms. The ministers and vassal kings were all happy to raise large numbers of wandering knights to fill their own strength, or even to compete with the central government. The wandering knights each formed gangs and each had their own supported leaders. The supported leaders, "raced in the alleys and lanes, became famous throughout the world, wielded power in the states, and could bend dukes and marquises with their strength." Although they had no official positions or titles, they were able to "steal the power of life and death with the smallness of a commoner." This was usually a factor of unrest and unease in an agricultural society, becoming a major concern in the countryside. Emperor Wu of the Han also regarded them as a force of evil that split the power of the emperor and hated them bitterly.

The second of the above three matters had already been regarded as a major crisis in society by the Confucian scholars before Emperor Wu. What he worried about was that the poor and weak farmers, in order to escape hunger and cold, would sell their wives, children, and fields and homes, and after embarking on a path of exile, there was the possibility of revolutionary events occurring. Therefore, after Emperor Wu ascended the throne, Dong Zhongshu also proposed the object of "limiting the people's private ownership of land to supplement those who are insufficient." However, Emperor Wu of the Han did not deeply recognize the importance of this issue. He did not regard it as an ailment that should be treated. He was simply fascinated by the wealth of the national treasury and the superficial prosperity of society, and was led onto the path of "inwardly indulging in the pleasures of the senses and outwardly pursuing the achievements of subduing the four barbarians." He wanted to use this rich wealth and manpower to launch military campaigns abroad, complete the great task of conquering the four barbarians, and eliminate all separatist efforts at home, so that he alone could enjoy supreme glory.

Emperor Wu wanted to launch military campaigns, but the general public was absolutely unwilling to leave their homes and abandon their livelihoods to serve on the battlefield. At this time, Emperor Wu had no choice but to use severe punishments to drive the people to pursue meritorious achievements. And when the use of troops lasted for a long time, the granaries and treasuries

### Kowloon City House Demolition Incident: Intense Indignation from All Circles in the Capital

Liu Shishun Visits British Ambassador to Reiterate Stance

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The Kowloon City incident has aroused indignation among the general public, youth, and students. Social criticism largely attributes the unfortunate incident to the External Department's prolonged failure to resolve the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue. A large banner has appeared on the "Democracy Wall" within the National Chengchi University campus, advocating urging the government to swiftly take back Hong Kong and Kowloon, and many advocate initiating a widespread movement to support the government.

### Review of Measures to Suppress Hoarding

Yesterday's editorial discussed the problem of rising prices, arguing that emphasis should be placed on increasing production, fair distribution, stabilizing currency value, and balancing the budget – these proactive measures that address the root cause. We must earnestly and diligently 　, and not merely focus on the passive suppression measures of registration and inspection. This is not to say that "suppression" is definitely unusable, but at most, it can only be effective for a short time and does not contribute to the overall plan. Moreover, even when suppressing, it must be done reasonably and legally, and the cooperation of legitimate industrial and commercial organizations must be obtained. At the very beginning of this endeavor, it is absolutely impermissible to exceed the bounds of the law and act rashly. Only by cooperating with the people can officials achieve success. Advanced countries 　 管制, with organizational strength and social systems far 　 于 ours, still require caution and meticulousness when handling matters, let alone our country?

Currently, government officials believe that as long as the existing "Emergency Period Measures for Suppressing National Accumulation and Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities" are implemented, the rising price trend can be curbed. In reality, 　未免 this is an oversimplified view. This is because the current measures for suppressing hoarding have many shortcomings, as this newspaper has repeatedly pointed out in previous articles. The main points are: 　The "large-scale purchase and storage" that constitutes the crime is too vague, making it difficult to adjudicate. 　The procedures for declaration, registration, reporting, and verification are too cumbersome, and various associations and responsible authorities will inevitably be unable to cope due to limited manpower. 　The "raising prices beyond legal profits" that constitutes hoarding is difficult to determine because current prices and various expenses fluctuate too dramatically, government offices lack information, and the "legal profits" of various items cannot be adjusted in a timely manner. There are also many other difficulties 　礙難 to implement. However, during the recent Executive Yuan meeting discussing this case, it was surprisingly decided that "the regulations are already complete, there is no need to draft new laws, and the procedures and formalities of legislation can be saved" and instead "drafting detailed implementation rules and then submitting them to the Executive Yuan for review" would be done. One cannot help but feel deeply disappointed. Perhaps the intention of all the officials is truly to save the legislative process, but saying that the regulations are already complete is probably not entirely true.

These measures were originally promulgated during the Anti-Japanese War and were also not subjected to legislative procedures. They were only reaffirmed and urged for implementation last year on February 17 when the Economic Emergency Measures Program was promulgated, due to too many obstacles and little effect. However, laws are laws, and facts are facts. According to what we know, despite the government's repeated orders and urging compliance, it seems that no businesses in this city have registered and reported according to the law, let alone correcting, reporting, and investigating. Moreover, according to Article 5 of these measures, the responsible authorities must first announce the types and names of goods to be suppressed. Given the large number of factories and shops in this city and the small number of personnel in the responsible authorities, how will they cope if all businesses come to register after the announcement? The reasons for this, in addition to the three major shortcomings mentioned above, are many other obstacles and questions. We will list them separately below for review.

The problem of agency buying fees, without a real buyer or seller, 　亦 is one of the grounds for constituting the 　積 crime according to Article 3. We do not understand how this transaction can be established if there is no buyer or seller. Almost every industry in Shanghai has 　客, that is, there is no industry 　無 without agency buying fees. These 　客, despite being criticized as being third parties, exploiting classes, and fictitious firms, there are no explicit regulations prohibiting them in the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan. On the contrary, Article 3 of the current Commercial Registration Law explicitly lists brokerage, commission, and agency businesses, and there is no prohibition against brokers from engaging in their own transactions. Therefore, this clause is clearly untenable.

The issue of market sales 　Not selling in the market, coupled with "raising prices beyond legal profits," constitutes hoarding. Article 11 of the same measures also includes the restriction of "not refusing to sell," the intention of which is to promote transactions in order to suppress hoarding. However, except for retail businesses, the goods of most owners are stored in warehouses and are not publicly displayed. Even if all businesses register and report, how can general buyers know for sure that such goods are stored? Moreover, how can they determine that it constitutes "not selling in the market" or "refusing to sell"? If one were to say that since it has been registered, one can simply consult it, it is questionable whether Chinese-style government offices would allow any buyer to readily consult and examine records at any time, and what provisions could be relied upon to allow consultation? As for goods under unified purchase and sale, it is even more impossible to sell them at market prices, so how can these measures be applied?

The issue of selling within a limited time 　Articles 8, 10, 11, and 12 of the measures all explicitly mention selling within a limited time. Leaving aside the question of what the specific time limit is, the sale of goods ultimately depends on 　胃口 (demand). In many places, there are even restrictions based on affiliation, season, and type. In the current state of restricting payments and domestic remittances, the financial resources of buyers are especially problematic. If a deadline for sale is set, but there are no buyers or the demand is too narrow to absorb the supply, how can a sale be enforced at that time? We also know that according to the provisions of Articles 10 and 12, the responsible authorities can order the goods to be transported to a designated location for sale, sell them on behalf of the owner, have the trade association sell them on behalf of the owner, or have the materials management or price-controlled supply and marketing agencies purchase them. However, when the market is sluggish, it is not easy to sell all 　貨 goods unless there is a truly large-scale 　, selling at a loss. Moreover, the measures repeatedly mention the so-called legal profit, and it does not seem that they must necessarily sell at a loss; when ordering merchants 　 令 to sell within a limited time, it seems that the responsible authorities do not have the power to force merchants to sell at a loss, harming the legitimate interests of the owners. Therefore, what happens when the goods cannot be sold within the time limit remains a problem.

Some may say that materials management and price-controlled supply and marketing agencies are presumably not private in nature and should have no difficulty 　款 purchasing. However, even the resources of non-private agencies have their limits. The fact that goods imported without a license require the use of certificates of deposit for payment and must be paid in installments is sufficient proof. The fact that many export goods cannot be sold, and the industries have repeatedly requested purchases, but have ultimately been refused due to lack of budget is another proof. Even if the government issues huge amounts of banknotes 　款 and undertakes to collect fees, it is clearly another problem whether this huge amount of banknotes is consistent with the original intention of suppressing hoarding and stabilizing prices.

The issue of reporting, declaring, registering, and verifying. Articles 8 and 9 stipulate that before the implementation of these measures, all merchants, whether in the industry or not, should report their inventory for sale, and the trade associations should review and report; Article 13 further stipulates that after the implementation of these measures, merchants in the industry should register with the trade association each time they purchase goods and report when they sell them, and the trade association should submit monthly reports to the responsible authorities for verification. The procedures are so cumbersome that we will not discuss whether there are enough personnel in the merchants, trade associations, and government offices to handle this matter. However, after each batch of goods and each transaction goes through the above-mentioned procedures of declaring, reporting, registering, and submitting, the final result is nothing more than a cursory examination and verification. The process is top-heavy and bottom-light, and seems to be quite thought-provoking. Because the final step is only verification, it seems that the above-mentioned cumbersome procedures are not necessary, and it is impossible to suppress hoarding. If 　要 the goal is to suppress illegal hoarding, then this verification work is obviously still insufficient. May we ask, how can the traces of hoarding be detected simply by checking the reported goods and the reported numbers of inputs and outputs from both within and outside the industry? How can the loopholes of omission, false reporting, underreporting, and overreporting be traced and corrected? Moreover, if a government office lacking administrative efficiency is forced to handle such trivial and cumbersome matters, the result may be that the government offices merely produce more paper reports!

From the above points of view, although the Executive Yuan believes that "the regulations are already complete, there is no need to draft new laws," the fact is that 　張 the gap is too large, and there is a definite need to reconsider and revise them. Because the drafting of detailed implementation rules, 　名思義, is merely to supplement the implementation procedures appropriately, but the shortcomings and difficulties in the measures themselves are already a foregone conclusion and may not be corrected. Therefore, the result of implementation may still be ineffective. Is this the original intention of the government to suppress prices?
