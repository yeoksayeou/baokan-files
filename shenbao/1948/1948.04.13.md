### The Sixth Session of the National Assembly: Minister Bai Delivers Military Report; Acknowledges the Increased Strength of the Communist Bandits, Which Should Not Be Underestimated

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The National Assembly held its sixth session on the morning of the 12th. Due to a majority of representatives attending the central memorial week at the Ministry of National Defense, the meeting was delayed until 10:05 AM. 1,574 representatives were present, and the ninth presidium group presided on rotation, chaired by Wang Yunwu. After the secretariat read the minutes of the fifth meeting, Wang reported on two decisions made by the presidium at its evening meeting on the 11th: (1) The list of presidential candidates will be announced on the 16th, and the list of vice-presidential candidates will be announced on the 20th. The announcement will be made through publication in the National Government Gazette, notification to each representative, and posting near the entrance of the assembly hall. There was no objection from the entire assembly. The agenda for this morning was a military report and review, delivered by Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi. It lasted for an hour, and due to time constraints, the review could not be conducted. The meeting adjourned at 11:53 AM. During Minister Bai's report, senior generals from the Ministry of National Defense were present in the government officials' seats as observers.

Minister Bai's military report was divided into three points: (1) The organization of the Ministry of National Defense and its responsibilities; (2) The trends in national defense construction over the past two years; (3) The course and development of the communist bandits' conspiracy to harm the nation. In addition, detailed reports were given on the implementation of total war in Central China and the meager treatment of military personnel, which garnered several rounds of applause.

Bai first stated: Chairman Chiang has already given detailed reports on the situations in the Northeast, North China, Northwest, and Central China battlefields. The organization of the Ministry of National Defense is based on the systems of the United States, Britain, and France, as well as the national conditions of our country. The Ministry of National Defense is under the Executive Yuan and serves as a decision-making body. Its implementation is the responsibility of the Chief of General Staff and the commanders-in-chief of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Combined Logistics. Over the past two years, national defense has been established under the principles of safeguarding the integrity of national territory and sovereignty and preventing foreign aggression, while also adapting to the current need to suppress bandits and the needs of future wars. The progress of weaponry is closely related to scientific progress, and the Ministry of National Defense is currently assisting the National Defense Science Committee in its research. In terms of personnel, a conscription system and intensive training for high school graduates are being implemented as sources of soldiers and officers.

Regarding the communist bandits' harm to the nation, Bai pointed out the communist bandits' use of the War of Resistance against Japan as a pretext to attack friendly forces and expand their strength. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the communist bandits' troops numbered only 30,000, but by the time of victory, they had grown tenfold to 310,000. After the victory, political negotiations allowed the communist bandits to grow stronger. They now have over 1.3 million field army soldiers, not including military region troops and militia. The communist bandits now have an evil history of many years, hundreds of thousands of armed personnel, international backing, and combat experience. We should not underestimate them. On July 1st of last year, the government issued an order for mobilization to suppress the rebellion, determined to resolve the communist bandits militarily. The communist bandits' propaganda that they crossed the Yellow River last year and will cross the Yangtze River this year is not empty talk. The communist bandits' crossing of the Yellow River has already been realized. Whether they will cross the Yangtze River this year will depend on our strength.

### Mobilize the Power of Total War; Suppressing the Rebellion Cannot Rely Solely on the National Army; It Is Necessary to Organize the People to Prevent Problems Before They Arise

Regarding how to mobilize to complete the suppression of the rebellion, Minister Bai repeatedly and solemnly pointed out that it cannot rely solely on the National Army; it is necessary to mobilize the power of the people. We cannot sit and wait for the bandits to come; we must prevent problems before they arise. He especially hoped that the representatives present would return to their hometowns and engage in leadership work, believing that with the power of the entire nation, the communist bandits could be eliminated. Bai pointed out that the communist bandits implemented a "hollowed-out defense" preparation last year, as well as the "three requests" policy of seeking soldiers, seeking food, and seeking battle. We, on the other hand, are countering with total war. Bai used his experience of being ordered to take charge of the suppression in the Dabie Mountains area since November 7th of last year as an example, saying: Liu Bocheng's bandit troops, numbering about 120,000, fled to the Dabie Mountains, attempting to build a base area. We implemented total war, first using military force to defeat the main force of the bandits, then using military force to cover political planning, consolidate the political center, organize and equip civilian forces, and then use politics to coordinate with military affairs, implementing suppression, controlling the area, and breaking the bandits' "three requests" policy. This method has gradually become effective. Most of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops have fled north, and only three regiments of remnant bandits remain in the Dabie Mountains area, which are currently being suppressed. Bai said: The total war in the Dabie Mountains is a test. In the past, local leaders had too little authority, which prevented them from exerting their power. Now, pacification zones are being demarcated in various places, and personnel, finance, and other powers are concentrated in the hands of the pacification zone commander. In the future, the power of total war can be brought into play. After Bai highly praised the people's defense forces in western Henan, saying that the people's defense forces in western Henan had made great contributions in the War of Resistance and the suppression of bandits, he said that what can be done in western Henan can also be done in other provinces. Bai especially introduced their slogan: "Risk your life to protect your life, bankrupt yourself to protect your property." This can be implemented everywhere. Local self-defense forces are funded by the central government, and demobilized soldiers are employed as officers. Armories are also established in various places to replenish weapons and ammunition. Bai also revealed that a fairly large armory has been established in western Henan, which will be able to produce finished products in about four months.

For the sake of preparedness, Bai advocated that the provinces south of the Yangtze River should also expand the authority of local leaders, organize popular forces, and eliminate the hidden forces of the communist bandits, so that they cannot be internal collaborators for crossing the river. Do not wait until after the communist bandits have crossed the river to take action, or it will be too late to regret.

When Bai described the issue of military discipline, he analyzed that the actual salary received by soldiers and officers was less than a quarter of what it was before the war. The poor food of the soldiers affects their health and combat effectiveness, and taking from the local people increases their burden. To implement total war, soldiers must be fed and horses must be fattened so that the officers and soldiers can exert their best efforts.

Bai concluded: We do not need to be pessimistic about suppressing and reducing the communist bandits; we must have confidence. If the people in every locality can organize, risk their lives to protect their lives, bankrupt themselves to protect their property, and coordinate with military suppression, the work of suppressing the rebellion can be completed smoothly. Bai also said: When the representatives review military affairs, he hopes that they will not hesitate to give their advice.

After Bai's report, Zhang Tifang, a representative from Chahar, and Zhao Yongfu, a representative from Shandong, spoke on the military situation in the Northeast and Shandong. As the legally stipulated adjournment time had arrived, the meeting was adjourned.

### The Chairman Sends Chen Lifu and Others to Console Hunger-Striking Representatives

Persuasion to Resume Eating Still Yields No Results

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The National Assembly representatives who signed in and were elected have been on a hunger strike for over two weeks. Chairman Chiang is very concerned about their health and specially sent Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, He Zhonghan, and Zheng Yanfen on the afternoon of the 12th as representatives to the Fifth Reception Center to express condolences and persuade them to resume eating. Chen and the others arrived at the Fifth Reception Center at 2:00 PM and advised the eight representatives that they should prioritize their health and resume eating first; as for the issue of attending the assembly, a solution could be found. After persuading them until 4:00 PM, the hunger-striking representatives stated that they were still unwilling to resume eating unconditionally without a concrete and definite guarantee, but they all expressed their great gratitude for Chairman Chiang's kindness.

### National Assembly Representatives Review Military Affairs; Enthusiastically Express Frank Opinions; Demand Investigation of Negligent Generals

The National Assembly continued its session at 12:30 PM, presided over by the tenth presidium group, chaired by Huang Jilu. After Yu Bin reported on the presidium's handling of the motion proposed by Wang Yunming and 1,321 others regarding the issue of signed representatives, the review of military affairs began. The total number of representatives requesting to speak reached over 230, but each speaker was often unable to limit themselves to within five minutes, so by the time the meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM, less than 30 people had spoken. Some representatives submitted their written opinions to the secretariat to be read out. Summarizing the opinions of the representatives, they generally focused on the following points: (1) The treatment of military personnel is too low, and soldiers are not eating enough, which affects their combat effectiveness; (2) There are too many abuses in conscription; (3) The discipline of some units is too poor; (4) The command methods of the General Headquarters should be improved, so that local commanders have the power to make expedient commands; (5) After the victory, the guerrilla units in the Northeast and North China were reorganized one by one, forcing them into rebellion, which was tantamount to providing resources to the communists; (6) High-ranking military officers are corrupt and engage in illegal activities, and the personnel who took over only cared about materials, resulting in the loss of popular support; (7) The compensation for the families of soldiers who died in the suppression of the rebellion is inadequate, and the procedures are too cumbersome; (8) The central government should replenish the local armed forces with weapons and ammunition; (9) Rewards and punishments are unclear, right and wrong are not distinguished, and why are the responsible authorities not punished? Several representatives expressed strong dissatisfaction that Minister Bai's report did not cover North China and the Northeast. The representatives from the Northeast and Shandong were especially critical of Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng. Yin Bingyan from Andong advocated "borrowing heads" to boost morale. Zhang Zhenlu from Liaobei requested that Chairman Chiang emulate Zhuge Liang in "executing Ma Su with tears." Zhang Luxian from Shandong made an urgent motion requesting the detention of Chen Cheng. Cui Tianyi from Jilin requested that Liang Huasheng be dismissed and severely punished. Wu Shuban from Liaoning said: All generals who have harmed the country should be investigated. In addition, those with urgent war situations in various places requested that troops be sent immediately to reinforce them. Zhang Zhenlu requested that Liaopan be secured and the Shenjin line be opened. Wen Guangyi from Anhui shouted that the crisis in Central China was no less than that in the Northeast and North China. Wang Lunqing from Henan requested that the National Assembly send a telegram to the Ministry of National Defense requesting reinforcements for Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. Li Peiguo from Rehe said: Chengde is surrounded on all sides, and he hopes that the assembly will decide to send troops to aid Rehe. Hu Zhongwu from Anhui pointed out that the hidden bandits in southern Anhui should be suppressed. The Shandong representatives also requested that a large army be sent as soon as possible to relieve the crisis in Changle and Weixian. Huo Tianyi from Jilin appealed to the government to deal with the communist bandits in the Northeast and North China with all its strength. The meeting continued until 6:00 PM, and the chairman announced an extension of 20 minutes. There were still many speakers, and it was finally decided to hand over the opinions of the representatives to the secretariat for collation and submission to the Ministry of National Defense for a response.

### The National Army in Western Liaoning is Getting Stronger; Traffic Between Shenyang and Jinzhou Can Be Opened Soon; Bandits on the North Bank of the Liao River Have Been Repelled

[Our Jinzhou Dispatch, 12th] The strength of the National Army in the western Liaoning corridor, centered on Jinzhou, is expanding and increasing daily. These new forces are mostly veteran soldiers who have re-enlisted. Once they are equipped, they can fight. Moreover, Li Mi's troops, who have been landing at Huludao for several days, have mostly arrived at their designated areas. This is news that Jinzhou and Shenyang are paying attention to and are happy to hear. Shenyang is eagerly awaiting the National Army to open up traffic between Jinzhou and Shenyang, which may not be far off. The local military authorities are currently making an action plan and deployment. Fan Hanjie and Sun Du are traveling between Shenyang and Jinzhou and to Huludao to see the landing troops and other work, all of which shows that traffic between Jinzhou and Shenyang is bound to be opened.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] Around Jiumen, Sanmianchuan on the north bank of the Liao River, about 5,000 invading bandits were repelled. This was a battle for food and not yet the prelude to the spring offensive. The bandits wandering near Shahe are still observing the situation. There is no fighting south of Shenyang, and Benxi is quiet.

[Another Dispatch] The communist bandits in the Northeast are actively building railways to facilitate supplies. The two lines from Harbin to Yongji and from Yongji to Yanji have been repaired. Traffic has also opened between Tongliao and Zhangwu.

### The Battle Situation in Central Henan is Calm Before the Storm; The Two Communist Bandit Commanders Chen Yi and Chen Geng Plan to Attack Zhengzhou with 70,000 Troops; Bandits Fleeing East from Xingyang Are Met with a Head-On Blow

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 12th] After the National Army recovered Queshan and Zhumadian, the war in southern Henan has become quiet. It is reported that Chen Yi's 3rd and 8th Columns and Chen Geng's 4th and 9th Columns, totaling about 70,000 men, are encircling Zhengzhou.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 12th] After Chen Yi's 3rd Column captured Xinzheng, it fled north again on the 11th to the Xue Dian and Baishuliu areas. In addition, the main forces of Chen Geng's 4th and 9th Columns and Chen Yi's 8th Column fled to the area between northeast of Fanshui and Guangwu on the 11th. Another group of bandits fled east from Rongyang to Sanguanmiao on the 11th, and the defending troops are giving them a head-on blow.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 12th] The 3rd and 6th Columns of Liu's bandits, who fled west along the Pinghan Railway, are currently being severely attacked by Hu Lian's troops in the Xizhai and Shengou Miao areas west of Xiping. Air Force planes flew to the area south of Wuyang and west of Suiping on the morning of the 12th to search for and bomb the bandits, causing heavy casualties.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 12th] Dong Shaoming, the director of the "Central China Military Region Prisoner Management Office," a confidant of Liu Bocheng, was captured after the National Army captured Zhumadian. The fact that the manager of prisoners was captured is a laughable matter.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th] Sun Zhen, the director of the Land Headquarters here, recently made a statement to reporters regarding the battle situation in central Henan, saying: The situation southwest of Zhengzhou is calm before the storm. The communist bandits are hovering within 20 li. About three columns of bandits fled east from Gongxian, and about one column of bandits fled south to Zhengzhou from the Linjiang and Jiaxian areas. If the bandits attack Zhengzhou, the fighting can be ended in three or four days.

[Another Dispatch] The bandits who fled southwest to Zhengzhou have begun to flee back in all directions. In the Linggang and Linghou areas northwest of Guodian, 45 li south of Zhengzhou, most of the more than 400 bandits fled back to Sanshilipu, 30 li north of Xinzheng, on the morning of the 12th.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 12th] The bandits in the Luoning and Yichuan areas of western Henan have fled back to Luoyang after being blocked and attacked by local defense forces and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the defending forces in Guanyintang.

### The National Assembly Will Review the Economy Today

Reports from the Ministers of Finance, Food, Communications, and Economy

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The National Assembly is scheduled to hold its seventh session on the morning of the 13th, chaired by He Yaozu and Yu Jiaju.

### The Central Executive Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party Resolves to Support Chairman Chiang's Candidacy

Nominates Xu Fulin as a Candidate for Vice President

[Our Report] The Central Executive Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party, which was held the day before yesterday, made the following important resolutions: (1) To support Chairman Chiang's candidacy for president, believing that the chairman's leadership position was created by 20 years of history, and that at this time of national difficulty, no one but Chairman Chiang can be president; (2) To nominate Xu Fulin, a standing committee member of the party, as a candidate for vice president; (3) To oppose amending the constitution in this National Assembly, because what is valued in the constitution is its ability to serve as a guideline for political behavior, and its merits and demerits can only be seen in practice, so it opposes amending it before it is implemented; (4) To express regret over the manipulation and fraud in the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators.

### The National Army in Chahar Recovers Huai'an; The Northern Section of the Jinpu Railway Advances to Ziyazhen

[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 12th] Huai'an in Chahar Province was once disturbed by bandits, but the National Army recovered the city at 3:00 PM on the 11th. The remnant bandits fled in the direction of Huashaoyingzi.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 12th] The National Army is continuing its mopping-up operations on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and captured Ziyazhen (20 kilometers southwest of Chenguantun) today.

[Another Dispatch] The siege of Sanhe on the Pingjin Highway was lifted this morning. The communist bandits' Independent 4th and Independent 5th Divisions fiercely attacked the north and west passes of Sanhe City on the evening of the 10th and were once broken through. The defending troops fought hard for a day and night. Last night, the National Army detoured to aid in three routes. The communist bandits are still fleeing northwest today.

### Henan National Assembly Representatives to Meet Today; To Discuss Strategies to Rescue Zhengzhou and Kaifeng

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] With the situation in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng tense, dozens of Henan National Assembly representatives, including Zhang Fang, Chen Panling, and Yan Huatang, are actively seeking assistance, requesting that the central government urgently dispatch a large army to rescue them. In view of the seriousness of the current situation, Zhang and others have decided to convene an emergency meeting of all Henan National Assembly representatives on the morning of the 13th to discuss strategies to rescue Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. Zhang originally intended to meet with Chairman Chiang again on the evening of the 12th, but temporarily abandoned the plan and will wait until after the Henan National Assembly meeting on the 12th to decide.

### Wang Yaowu Flies to Inspect Changle and Weixian; Communicates with the Defending Generals in the Air and Drops a Handwritten Letter; The Bandits Fiercely Attacking Weixian Are Repeatedly Repelled

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 12th] Amidst the fierce fighting in Changle and Weixian, Wang Yaowu flew over Changle and Weixian for inspection at 1:15 PM on the 12th. The special plane arrived over Changle City at 2:00 PM. The soldiers and civilians in the city waved their hands to indicate when the plane arrived, appearing extremely excited. The bandit trenches and bunkers surrounding the city were densely packed. Wang communicated with the defending general Zhang Jingyue, expressing his great encouragement, and dropped a handwritten letter and a pennant with the handwritten inscription "Bulwark of Central Shandong." After flying around the city for a week, he inspected the area above Tianma. When he arrived over Weixian at 2:15 PM, the fighting at the northwest pass was fierce. There were large fires everywhere outside the north gate and on the northeast and northwest sides of the city. The area outside the north gate had become a sea of fire, and white smoke was rising to over 1,000 meters. Wang communicated with the defending general Chen Jincheng, encouraging him with the words "Everything has a solution," "Certain victory," and "Certain success." After inspecting the area above Weixian for three weeks, he inspected Fangzi and Hanting and other places before returning to Jinan at 3:40 PM.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 12th] The National Army is still firmly defending Weixian, Hanting, Changle, and Tianma, and the fighting has reached a fever pitch. On the evening of the 11th, the bandits launched another fierce attack on Weicheng. The fighting at Nanguan Leixiaoshan and Nandaying was especially fierce. The bandits broke through the city pass positions several times but were eventually repelled. All four passes are currently standing firm. The bandit army is using heavy artillery to bombard the city, causing casualties among the residents. Although the situation at the airport, Ershilipu, and Fangzi is unclear, Fangzi may still be under the control of the National Army. The troops of Zhang Jingyue, the defending general of Changle, launched an attack in three directions on the morning of the 11th, completely defeating two battalions of the bandit Bohai 14th and 15th Regiments and destroying the bandit blockhouses. The positions at Changle and Tianma are extremely solid.

### Representatives from Changle and Weixian Arrive in Nanjing to Request Reinforcements

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Li Yuting, a representative from the Changle and Weixian areas of central Shandong, has come to Nanjing specifically to request troops. According to him: The Changle and Weixian areas are strategically important and are the spiritual bulwarks of the people of Shandong. The defenders of Changle and Weixian are a brigade of the National Army and ten regiments of local troops. The communist bandits have been launching a full-scale attack since the 10th, and the defending troops are fighting fiercely. There are a total of 35,000 students in Weixian City, and there are also many righteous people. If they are unfortunately lost, the loss of personnel will be irreplaceable. We originally planned to ask the central government to airlift troops to aid us, but now that Fangzi Airport has been lost, we only hope that large armies will be dispatched from Qingdao and Jinan to relieve the siege, or at least the air force should assist the troops in covering the evacuation of the students and people. We must not sit idly by and fail to rescue them.

### The National Army in Dongguan, Linfen, Automatically Withdraws Westward

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 12th] There was a bloody battle in Dongguan, Linfen on the 11th. Bandit corpses were scattered everywhere, but due to the disparity in numbers, the National Army automatically withdrew westward. The fierce fighting shifted to the outer edge of the moat outside the east gate. After Dongguan fell to the bandits, the battle situation was quieter on the 12th. Nearly 1,000 cadres and students have joined the army.

### A Chronicle of the National Assembly: A Verbal Battle on Military Affairs

[Our Special Report] In the National Assembly Hall, filled with an atmosphere of peace, the intense smell of gunpowder was also detected today: verbal swords and oral spears, reviewing the responsibility for lost territories and harm to the country on the one hand, and trying to turn the tide on the other, wanting to borrow troops. This military review, though unable to summon wind and rain, is better than mere armchair theorizing.

The long report by Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense today gave people the impression that it lacked the changes in the war situation and strategy that everyone valued, and the authorities' preparations for the current key situation and tactics. However, the coordination of military, political, and economic affairs in the overall war and the organization of local armed forces were quite satisfactory. However, as his report was nearing its conclusion, a burst of cannon fire came from a corner upstairs, descending from the sky. Some people called for the seriousness of the current situation in the Northeast, and the Shandong representatives downstairs also demanded the punishment of those responsible. However, due to time constraints, there was no time to hear a reply, and the morning session ended.

The afternoon session was supposed to be a review of the military report. Chairman Huang Jilu was presiding over the proceedings on the stage, and requests to speak were flying up like snowflakes. Regarding the review of the situation in the Northeast, the representatives demanded that Xiong Shihui and Chen Cheng attend the meeting to report, as they wanted to investigate the responsibility for turning the Northeast into a state where almost no county town was intact. One Northeast representative after another spoke, and every word earned a thunderous round of applause.

To Boost Morale, Advocate for "Borrowing Heads"

The Andong representative Yin Bingyan said on the speaker's platform: "My method is the simplest. To boost morale, we only need to borrow a few heads to use." The representatives shouted in agreement. When Yin spoke passionately, he repeatedly pounded the table with his fist, and the audience responded with applause and cheers. Yin Bingyan's concluding remark was: "Please ask the authorities, were they right or wrong in what they did in the Northeast? If they were right, they should be awarded the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun, but if they were wrong, they should be killed!" Zhang Zhenlu from Liaobei said: "There are 600,000 to 700,000 troops eating food in the Northeast, but only 300,000 are actually fighting. The Ministry of National Defense should investigate!" Yang Zhiping from Liaobei said: "The battle situation in the Northeast is a dead game. The officers who go to the Northeast only know how to want houses, want cars, marry wives, and deduct military pay. The officers are getting rich, and the soldiers are not eating enough. How do you expect them to fight?" Li Xiangtai said: "At the time of victory, there were 150,000 soldiers of the puppet Manchurian army and 300,000 police in the Northeast, all of whom were driven to the communist party. High-ranking government officials were secretly helping the communist party. Shouldn't the government punish them?" A female representative from the Northeast advocated taking Tianjin and Beiping as the base for suppressing the bandits, with Chuan Zuoyi unifying the political, military, and economic affairs. She said: "Chuan Zuoyi is the only hope for the people of the North!" Then the Henan representatives shouted that Zhengzhou and Kaifeng were like cities in danger. The Shaanxi representatives emphasized that the situation in the Northwest was no less serious than that in the Northeast and North China. The representatives from Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei said that the traces of the bandits north and south of the Yangtze River were threatening the capital. In the end, every speaker proposed an "urgent motion" to call for action, emphasizing its importance. They wanted the central government to send a large army to rescue them to address the symptoms, and to organize local self-defense forces to address the root cause. They were representing the voices of millions of people in the Northeast, North China, Northwest, and Central China, and they wanted to take this opportunity to express their grievances of the past two years to the central government and make specific demands.

Passionate and Enthusiastic, Cries Accompanied by Applause

Every word was truthful, and every event was heartbreaking. The atmosphere in the hall was very different from the past. In the past, it was fatigue bombing plus chaos and noise. Today, there were passionate and just cries and applause. Therefore, the meeting time was extended by 20 minutes unexpectedly, and it still felt extremely short. Finally, the chairman proposed that all the opinions of the representatives, whether oral or written, be handed over to the secretariat for collation and organization, which was agreed to by most people. Thus, this military review with the scent of gunpowder came to an end. (April 12th in Nanjing)

### Special Article: On the So-Called "Crisis of Education"

— Mao Zishui

What is the crisis of education? It seems everyone can answer this question, but the answers will likely differ. The most common answer seems to be: "The poor economic situation of the country leaves teachers and students struggling to feed themselves, so how can we talk about education!" However, I believe that while the economic relationship is a major reason hindering educational progress, it is not the only reason, and not the biggest reason. As a matter of fact, more than seven out of ten students in national universities are on public scholarships. These scholarship students only bear the costs of clothing and books. To receive a university education, one should at least be able to raise this amount. The remaining three out of ten students either have better family circumstances or receive other scholarships, so the truly impoverished are few in number. As for teachers, those with large families are of course in great difficulty; those with smaller families, if their salaries can be adjusted appropriately, can barely manage to maintain basic food and clothing. When the country reaches this point, we should comfort ourselves internally with "A gentleman is steadfast in poverty," and externally we should take good citizens in the world who are suffering—such as the British—as examples. If we only want to admire the lives of corrupt officials or wealthy merchants, then that is just "asking for trouble."

Of course, I am not saying that there are no problems with our country's education funding now. Education requires equipment. The expenses required for higher education equipment are especially enormous. Because it not only requires books, but also instruments, chemicals, and so on. And most of these things can only be obtained with foreign exchange. Given our country's financial situation, we really cannot have such abundant foreign exchange to equip all national universities with modern equipment.

But in addition to the funding problem, there is an even greater crisis in education in China now. This greater crisis lies in the teachers and students themselves. The person writing this article is a teacher, so let me start with the teachers.

Many teachers are highly knowledgeable and virtuous, and many excel in one aspect. The former are of course both "teachers of knowledge and teachers of people," and the latter are also worthy of being role models for the younger generation. However, I believe that teachers should also bear the responsibility of guidance in students' lives in addition to imparting knowledge, and teachers should treat students as their own children. Good behavior of students should of course be encouraged and supported; inappropriate behavior of students should also be warned against and dissuaded from. One of the biggest crises in education in China now is that teachers are too indifferent to the behavior of students.

In addition, there is an even worse phenomenon: some teachers, in order to "win the crowd," try their best to cater to the psychology of students, and praise students' behavior without regard to right or wrong. The harm of such people is actually greater than those who only know how to suppress students. Because the latter may still have the good of the students at heart, while those who cater to the psychology of students are all "only concerned with their own success, regardless of the life or death of others." Although there are not many such people, they can be said to be the dregs of the education community!

As for the students, the situation is similar to that of the teachers. Among the students, there are those who are exceptionally gifted, understanding ten things from hearing one; such students make people feel refreshed. Among the students, there are those who study diligently, ask questions eagerly, and follow the rules; such students make people feel happy. Among the students, there are those who readily accept good advice and bravely pursue justice; such students inspire ambition. But these types of students, when added up, I am afraid only account for half of all students. As for the other half, most of them are mediocre. In fact, the function of education is most evident in the "average person." Unfortunately, the atmosphere in schools now is too bad, so that the average person does not get the benefit of "hemp growing among weeds, standing upright without being propped up," but only gets the detriment of "white sand in the mud, becoming black along with it." This is really the greatest crisis of education.

This bad school atmosphere is due to the nature of the students, but most of it is due to society and the school authorities. Let me give an example of something that is most easily seen and generally considered unimportant. Now, there are bulletin boards on the walls of universities, and slogans are almost always seen on the pillars. As soon as you enter the school gate, you are greeted with a dazzling array. Decorating a "university" to be more "beautiful" than an old-fashioned theater is really enough to make people "laugh and cry." Over time, people get used to it. The school authorities turn a blind eye, and the students improve their skills day by day, innovating new patterns. From this small thing, one can also see the "culture" of a nation! If the school had advised the students on this kind of behavior from the beginning, so that there would be a certain limit, it would not have come to the current situation. Of course, if every student took learning as their primary task, and everyone knew how to love themselves and cherished the school, then this kind of behavior would not have occurred. Bulletin boards and slogans are really unimportant, but the atmosphere of the school is important!

Someone asked: "Bulletin boards and slogans are tools for students to express opinions or promote ideologies. If you don't approve of students making bulletin boards and posting slogans, aren't you reactionary?" On this, I have to defend myself. Students, for the sake of self-expression, can of course publish articles. But there are many ways to publish, and it is not necessary to use colored paper pasted on the wall. If it is necessary to use the form of a bulletin board, it should also be done through a proper method planned by all the students, so that it is not pasted everywhere, without order. The most important thing is that the person who makes the bulletin board must be responsible for every word and sentence they write. Whether it is about a private person or the government, do not scold indiscriminately, be based on facts, discuss the matter on its own merits, and do not say empty words: this is the attitude that a person who writes a bulletin board should have. If, because it is a bulletin board, they recklessly use the tricks of a village woman scolding in the street, then they are accustomed to vulgarity! This is what our soulful students should constantly reflect on. Otherwise, I really don't know where the current school atmosphere will lead the youth of China, and where it will lead "China."

As for slogans of an advertising nature, they do not seem appropriate in universities. Anything of an advertising nature has a bit of deception in it, and would our pure-hearted students be willing to commit the crime of deceiving their classmates? Even using slogans to promote ideologies is inappropriate. Students are in the highest institutions of learning. They have the books of ancient and modern sages to learn from, and they have teachers at the school to consult. They should also have a considerable ability to judge what is good and what is evil, and what is right and what is wrong. Using slogans to promote any ideology to classmates is a manifestation of the mentality of "thinking too highly of oneself and looking down on others." A person who has this mentality towards classmates is either arrogant or foolish.

In short, the poor discipline in schools is indeed the biggest crisis in education in China today. Bulletin boards and slogans are just one example. If we do not keep the destiny of our country and the culture of all mankind in mind, then there is naturally no so-called crisis of education. "Only by overcoming thoughts can one become a sage; only by not thinking of holiness can one act as a bandit." The greatest force in solving the crisis in China is not in the government, but in teachers and young students.

Amidst the loud music of the orchestra, after reviewing the guard of honor, they were accompanied by Han Hanying, the commander of the bandit suppression, to drive to the Army Reception Center to rest. Mr. Soong and others stayed there. Mr. Soong then met with reporters to talk about the mission of this trip: (1) to inspect the actual situation of bandit suppression, (2) to find ways to develop Hainan Island's fishing, salt, and mines, (3) to find ways to encourage overseas Chinese to return to Hainan to invest, and (4) to plan to establish a Hainan Industrial Company, first state-owned and then private, and to help increase the white paper quota for various newspapers.

### Bai Chongxi's Speech at a Banquet for Representatives of Islamic Countries

Stating the Important Significance of Convening the National Assembly

[Report from Nanjing by the Central News Agency, 12th] Minister Bai Chongxi hosted a banquet for envoys of Islamic countries and representatives to the National Assembly at 7 p.m. on the 12th. In his speech, he said: "Dear religious relatives: Today, I sincerely host a banquet for everyone to express my respect to the envoys of various Islamic countries stationed in Beijing and the representatives to the National Assembly of all Islamic faiths in the country. I would like to take this opportunity to introduce the representatives to the foreign guests, based on the meaning of 'all Muslims in the world are brothers.' I feel very happy in my heart.

The convening of this National Assembly is an unprecedented grand event in the history of China for 5,000 years, and its significance is very significant. Since the National Revolutionary Army inherited the teachings of the Founding Father and the leadership of President Chiang of the Kuomintang, after completing the Northern Expedition in the 17th year of the Republic of China, it was envied by Japan, which then triggered China's war against Japan and the Axis powers. Fortunately, with the joint efforts of the United Nations, justice was upheld and complete victory was achieved. Unfortunately, China was starting to build the country when it was disrupted by the Communist bandits. The National Government, in order to rescue the people and complete the revolutionary cause, ordered the mobilization for the suppression of the rebellion. But at this time when the Communist bandits are rampant, why is it necessary to convene this National Assembly? This is entirely because the convening of the National Assembly is a consistent proposition of the National Government, and the purpose is to establish a Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the Constitutional National Assembly was convened in the 35th year of the Republic of China to formulate the Constitution. This first National Assembly convened in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China is an epoch-making event in Chinese history. After this National Assembly is held, the Kuomintang will return power to the people and become a truly democratic republic.

Among the representatives to this National Assembly, there are about 100 representatives from various parts of the country who believe in Islam, accounting for one-thirtieth of all representatives. This is unprecedented in any previous meeting. In addition to being happy, I am happy to introduce them to my esteemed guests from the same religion."

### Two or Three Things About Building Walls in the Border City

— Our reporter, Liu Mengchi

[Our newspaper, Guiyang, 6th dispatch] Xu Fangyuan, the female county magistrate recently appointed to act as the magistrate of Xifeng County in Guizhou, previously participated in the election for the Legislative Yuan of the province. However, because she was nominated by a political party, her qualifications as a candidate were cancelled. She then joined with Lang Boyu, Wang Keqiang, and others who shared the same fate to sue Yuan Shibin, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guizhou Province and concurrently the Chief Executive of the Provincial Election Office, in the Guizhou Higher Court. The details of the case were reported in our newspaper's previous dispatch. The Higher Court immediately accepted the case based on the electoral laws and regulations and began a swift investigation. The court opened an investigation hearing on the afternoon of the 5th and summoned the original plaintiffs and defendants. This democratic lawsuit played out in this quiet and uneventful border mountain city, and because both parties were influential figures in the province, the courtroom was packed with onlookers, far more than usual.

A Democratic Lawsuit: Each Party Holds Their Own Views

At around 2 PM, Li Xuedeng, the president of the Higher Court, personally presided over the trial. The plaintiff, Ms. Xu Fangyuan, stated that she had taken office as the magistrate of Xifeng County two days ago and specially requested Ms. Lin Jiji, a former Construction [unclear character] reporter, to represent her in court. The defendant, Yuan Shibin, arrived at the court on time to await the trial with a composed and generous demeanor. The plaintiff accused the defendant of violating the law in handling the election, arguing that because she and others were nominated by 3,000 signatories to participate in the election for the Legislative Yuan, the Provincial Election Office did not list their names as candidates, which seemed to be a violation of the law. Furthermore, although she and others were members of the Kuomintang, they had already announced their withdrawal from the party in the newspaper and did not want to be bound by the party anymore. The defendant, Yuan Shibin, calmly responded that the reason for not listing their names as candidates was due to the time constraints. The Central Committee issued an order on February 16th, but because the voting dates in all counties of the province were set for February 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, and transportation in Guizhou was inconvenient, it was not easy to notify all counties, so they were not listed as candidates. Although she and others had withdrawn from the party, the withdrawal from the party had to await the approval of the Central Committee. Before the approval, they should still abide by party discipline, so they could not be listed as candidates. The plaintiffs and defendants repeatedly debated for two hours. Finally, the defendant Yuan Shibin replied that even if there was a mistake in this matter, it should be the fault of the General Election Office and the Central Standing Committee. The Provincial Election Office and himself were acting on orders from above, and the Provincial Election Office and himself did not bear any legal responsibility. Afterwards, President Li announced that the case still needed to collect sufficient information before reopening the trial. This democratic lawsuit that caused a sensation in the mountain city was adjourned at 5 PM. According to [unclear character] observers, since the female county magistrate Xu Fangyuan is a key figure in the case, and she has now achieved her goal of becoming a seventh-rank county magistrate, the development of the case will soon be terminated quietly by the plaintiff withdrawing the case or the court issuing a non-prosecution decision.

Elated and Celebrating: Guizhou Native Appointed Chairman

For nearly 14 or 15 years in Guizhou, no local person has presided over provincial affairs. This time, the central government appointed Mr. Gu Zhenglun from Anshun, a native of the province, as the Chairman of the province. When the news arrived, all 11 million people in the province were elated and celebrating, shouting in unison. The current Chairman of Guizhou Province, Mr. Yang Zihui, is from Guang'an, Sichuan. This time, he has been transferred to Changyi City. The central government believes that Mr. Yang has always had the ambition to develop the city. Since Yichang City is an important southwestern town in our country, it is bound to be logical and meritorious for this military and political figure to succeed as mayor and to be promoted to his hometown. Mr. Yang's transfer to Changyi was too sudden. Two days before the decision was made at the Executive Yuan meeting, Mr. Yang learned that it had become a foregone conclusion, so he sent Xiang Leifeng, Deputy Director of the Provincial Government Design and Assessment Committee and concurrently [unclear characters] of Guizhou Daily, to lead a group of personnel to Changyi by special train to handle matters related to the handover. The provincial and municipal governments rushed to handle the handover overnight. After the news was announced on April 2nd, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Senate, the Higher Court, and other institutions jointly initiated the preparation of a farewell rally for Chairman Yang Huigong's promotion by all sectors of the provincial capital, which was scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 10th at the Municipal Gymnasium, which Mr. Yang had painstakingly planned and built not long ago. There were grand ceremonies, Beijing and Sichuan operas, and it was decided to erect a commemorative bronze statue in the riverside park that he personally supervised the construction of. The presidium of the conference included 25 well-known figures from all walks of life. A public banquet was held in the evening with 50 tables. The planned expenses were 25 million yuan. The enthusiasm and solemnity of the farewell mood can be seen from this. Mr. Yang plans to leave Guizhou for Changyi on the 15th. Recently, the farewell parties initiated by various parties have been held seven or eight times a day, with tea and snacks or banquets. Mr. Yang must be present at each place and must give a farewell speech. The people of Guiyang praised Mr. Yang's construction achievements over the years. In particular, when elementary school teachers and students gathered to say goodbye, the guests and hosts burst into tears, which was the most touching. Mr. Yang was determined to build Guizhou with enthusiasm. This year, he originally planned to repair the east-west Zhonghua Heng Road in Guiyang City into a stone street, rebuild the Zhengzhong Bridge on the Nanming River with reinforced concrete, build new sites for model elementary schools in the city center, city east, and city south, and assist in the construction of the National Guiyang Normal College. Most of them have already started construction for more than a month and will soon be engaged in construction. However, the Executive Yuan ordered him to be transferred to Changyi, and he could not stop it. Mr. Yang said to reporters with a sigh, "If I had been given two more years, I would have been able to succeed completely."

Iron-Blooded Soldier: Sobbing and Unable to Finish His Speech

At the farewell banquet of 186 industrial and commercial trade associations, when Mr. Yang delivered his farewell speech, he was an iron-blooded soldier who had dominated the world, and he was so sad that he could not finish his speech. He even extended his departure date until the new Chairman Gu arrived in Guiyang before he left for Changyi. It is reported that Mr. Gu's arrival in Guizhou may be at the end of the month, and the construction of Guiyang can be worked on for another half a month. Mr. Yang is extremely concerned about those who serve in provincial and municipal institutions from the same [unclear character] in Guiyang. It has now been decided that the Guizhou Provincial Highway [unclear character] Transport Office will provide four free [unclear character] for civil servants and their families from [unclear character] who are commuting from Guiyang to Changyi on the daily passenger cars, and free baggage allowance of 30 kilograms, which will be registered by the Guiyang Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association. In order to express his condolences to the members of the provincial and municipal governments for their hard work over the past three years, he decided to allocate ten stones of yellow grain to each person from the remaining provincial administrative expenses for the 36th year, and three stones of yellow grain for public grain from January to March of this year, and also make up for the [unclear character] that was deducted from January to March of this year by 1.5, so that it would be paid in full. Before March, the average monthly salary of municipal government employees was only 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per month, but it was adjusted to 1.4 million to 1.5 million yuan per month yesterday. In this way, before leaving, each provincial and municipal civil servant can earn more than 10 million yuan, which increases their infinite attachment to Mr. Yang's departure.

### Soviet Union Actively Launches "War of Nerves": Traffic Control Extended to Austrian Territory; Traffic to Vienna in British-Occupied Zone Blocked; Soviet Union Demands US and Britain to Close Automobile Repair Stations on Berlin Highway

[United Press Berlin, 12th dispatch] The Soviet Union has strengthened its actions in German territory over the past ten days, which may make Berlin the Danzig of 1948. According to senior diplomatic figures, Soviet policy is clearly based on "trial and error, trying again if wrong," which may plunge the world into another world war. In the past ten days, it would not have been difficult for slightly nervous Soviet or American soldiers to fire a shot, repeating the tragedy of Sarajevo, Austria, in 1914. Fortunately, the two sides have been deadlocked without firing a shot, and the situation has calmed down.

[Associated Press Berlin, 12th dispatch] Soviet troops set up two checkpoints on the 12th on two highways in the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria used by the British. Over the past two weeks, the Soviet Union's war of nerves against Western countries has extended to Vienna. The Soviet Union's actions in Austria began on the 11th. Six British automobiles, full of military officers, drove to a point 50 miles southeast of Vienna, intending to enter the British-occupied zone. Because the British refused the Soviet Union's request to change to new identification cards, the Soviet army refused the automobiles to pass, and they returned. The war of nerves in Austrian territory continued on the 12th, with the Soviet army setting up a checkpoint on the international highway leading to the British airfield in its territory. Two British trains were blocked in Semmering. The British refused to show their new identification cards, but eventually passed. General Galloway, the British High Commissioner in Austrian territory, originally planned to inspect the British zone, but has now cancelled the plan and returned to Vienna to deal with the situation. At the same time, senior officers of the British and American general staffs held an emergency meeting in Vienna.

[French News Agency Vienna, 11th dispatch] The communist newspaper "People's Voice" published a declaration by the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party, headlined with the large characters "Everyone Out for May Day Demonstration," demanding that the people should go out to demonstrate at that time, demanding that the Allied forces withdraw immediately, cancel foreign control, and oppose the delay in signing a peace treaty.

[Reuters Berlin, 11th dispatch] The Soviet authorities have taken new restrictions on land traffic between Berlin and the Western occupation zones, demanding that the British and Americans close the British and American automobile repair stations on the highway passing through the Soviet-occupied zone between Berlin and Heimstedt. On this 160-kilometer-long highway, there are one British and one American rescue station each, 65 miles apart, which have been the resting and repair centers for Allied automobiles passing through the highway for the past two years. The Soviet Union stated when demanding the closure that these repair stations were only allowed to operate in winter. The US authorities have decided to close them starting from April 30th. The British side is still considering its response. After the automobile repair stations are closed, British, American, French, and other non-Soviet automobiles traveling on this sparsely populated highway will have no choice but to travel in convoys to prevent breaking down halfway and having no way to call for help.

### Like a "West Island" in the "East Sea": The British and American Zones Face Isolation; Traffic with Berlin Depends Only on Air Communication

[Reuters Berlin, 11th dispatch] Berlin has become more like a "West" island in the "East" Sea today. The Soviet Union's refusal to reissue the passes of the technicians who maintain the electrical wires between Britain and the United States and the western zones may cause these telegraph and telephone lines to break down and become unusable. The Soviet Union's demand that the British and Americans close the British and American automobile service stations on the highway between Berlin and the western zones is probably the first step in cutting off road traffic. If so, the Western Allies can only rely on airplanes to connect Berlin with West Germany, but at the same time, it is difficult to guarantee that the Soviet Union will not take action to interfere with this only air connection. The main traffic situation between Berlin and the Western occupation zones is summarized as follows: (1) "Railroad": Allied passenger cars between Berlin and West Germany have been suspended since April 1st. Freight cars entering Berlin are still normal, but those leaving Berlin must have special Soviet permission, which is quite troublesome. (2) "Highway": As of today, passenger cars are still operating normally, but Soviet troops strictly inspect dispatches outside Berlin and at the junction of the occupied zones. Once the British and American automobile service stations are abolished, automobiles whose parts are not absolutely reliable will not be able to travel the entire 190-kilometer route. (3) "Telecommunications Traffic": The Soviet side has requested that the British and American electrical wire maintenance teams stop their activities starting from April 15th. After that, telecommunications traffic between Berlin and the western occupied zones, and even foreign countries, will become increasingly difficult due to damage that cannot be repaired. After the wired telecommunications traffic is blocked, Berlin's wireless equipment will inevitably be unable to accept this large number of telecommunications. Moreover, if the Soviet Union intends to disrupt telecommunications, it will be very easy to disrupt the transmission of wireless communications. (4) "Air Transport": So far, the Soviet Union has shown no signs of interfering with air transport. However, after the [unclear character] incident in Berlin, the Soviet side may take measures to restrict air transport under the pretext of maintaining air safety.

### Averting Humanity's Calamity: Establishing a World Government

Proposal by the US Committee of Atomic Scientists

[Associated Press Princeton, New Jersey, 11th dispatch] The Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, led by Einstein, demanded on the 11th the organization of a world government, because otherwise "our traditional civilization will completely collapse." The committee warned that "today there are two hostile worlds, competing with all their might." It also stated that at this crossroads in history, there are three paths to follow: (1) Launching a preventive war. "When the United States uniquely possesses the atomic bomb, we should proactively choose the time and place to attack potential enemies." (2) Maintaining an armed peace between the two blocs. "However, historically this situation always leads to war." (3) A world government. The committee stated that due to the urgency of the crisis, immediate action should be taken, and indirectly urged President Truman to hold a meeting with Stalin—if necessary, a secret meeting. After the committee's document was released, Einstein told reporters that the United States does not have to give up its knowledge of atomic energy and its monopoly on the atomic bomb.

### Aung San and Others Hold State Funerals

[United Press Yangon, 11th dispatch] The eight members of the cabinet of Myanmar Prime Minister Aung San, who were [unclear character] in July last year, today had their [unclear character] at the Great Golden [unclear character] Pagoda. The entire city flew flags at half-mast. As the hearses passed, more than 100,000 residents bowed their heads to pay their final respects. Aung San's wife and children followed the hearse. The current Prime Minister, U Nu, and members of the diplomatic corps waited at the cemetery. Aung San's 76-year-old mother watched the procession pass, her eyes filled with tears. U Nu delivered a eulogy, saying that the whole country is determined to carry out the will of the late Prime Minister and strive for peace and unity. The sacrifice of the late Prime Minister has made Myanmar free.

### Commemorating the Anniversary of Roosevelt's Death: Lie Calls for Peace

[Reuters Hyde Park, New York, 12th dispatch] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie called today to stop all talk of war. He delivered a speech at the former residence of the late President Roosevelt, commemorating the third anniversary of his death, appealing to governments around the world to stop all talk about future wars and sincerely devote themselves to peace.

### Italian Election Campaign in Full Swing: National General Strike for One Hour This Morning

[United Press Rome, 12th dispatch] The General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communist Party, ordered a national general strike to be implemented for one hour starting at 10 AM this morning to protest the deaths of 35 trade union leaders in Sicily over the past two years. Telephones, trams, buses, and commerce were all shut down. Only railway workers and firefighters were unaffected.

[Reuters Rome, 11th dispatch] The Italian election campaign has reached a fever pitch today, the last Sunday before the general election. Political gatherings are being held from the Alps in the north to the southern tip of Sicily.

The Communist-controlled People's Front issued a declaration yesterday guaranteeing that it would prevent Italy from participating in any group for the purpose of war. The People's Front had previously called for no demonstrations to be held after the election. Therefore, observers believe that the People's Front now feels that it lacks the confidence to win. Prime Minister De Gasperi spoke in Pisa yesterday, solemnly stating: "I dare to assure you that after the election, I will never flee or maintain power by force. Italy is definitely not a Balkan country." Middle- and right-wing newspapers headlined the Soviet Union's veto in the Security Council against Italy's application to join the United Nations as propaganda material for the anti-Communist faction. There was a grand gathering in Milan Cathedral Square, with tens of thousands of pro-Communists from all over Milan province holding Italian flags and red flags, listening to the speech of the Italian Communist leader Togliatti. De Gasperi spoke in Savona today, saying that the Soviet Union also accepted American aid during the war, so Italy's acceptance of American aid today will not hinder its independence.

Bomb Explodes: Many Dead and Injured

[French News Agency Rome, 12th dispatch] When the People's Front of the Italian Communist and Socialist Parties held an election speech in Rome, someone threw a bomb at the audience at the meeting, causing two deaths and 22 injuries.

### US Director of Civil Affairs Arrives in Tokyo with Staff

[Central East Tokyo, 12th dispatch] Major General Norse, Director of the Civil Affairs Division of the US Department of the Army, arrived here today with a group of staff. They immediately held talks with civil affairs officials at Allied Headquarters.

### Columbia Severes Ties with the Soviet Union; Two Soviets Among Those Arrested for Rebellion; Pan-American Conference Decides to Continue Meeting in Bogota

[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 12th (Radio): Bogota dispatch reports that representatives of the countries attending the Pan-American Conference are scheduled to meet today to decide the date and location for continuing the conference. Whether the conference can continue in Bogota is highly questionable. Bogota suffered heavy losses after the riots, with all the larger buildings being burned. It is estimated that it will take at least five years to restore the city to its former state. The Communist Party was certainly involved in the riots, but most of the deaths and injuries occurred during looting by the poor masses.

[United Press International, Washington, 12th] The U.S. State Department received a telegram stating that the Colombian government radio announced on the 12th that Colombia has severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The severance occurred after the announcement on the 11th that two Soviet personnel were arrested for involvement in the Bogota rebellion. The Colombian government radio stated that fifteen foreign personnel, including two Soviets, were caught "on the spot", and several were captured alive. It also stated that three foreign personnel were arrested while creating unrest.

[Associated Press, Colombian Capital, 12th] After President Belles's coalition government took office yesterday, martial law was declared in the city and throughout the provinces to restore order. Due to the disruption of food supplies in the city, meat rationing has been implemented and milk distribution is being monitored. Although the unrest is gradually subsiding, public services remain suspended due to the general strike.

[Associated Press, Colombian Capital, 12th] Colombian President Belles broadcasted on national radio on the 12th that the communist rebellion had been suppressed by the military and the riots in the city had stopped. The government accused the Communist Party of instigating the murder of Liberal leader Gaitan, as well as the subsequent arson and looting. However, the U.S. delegation led by Marshall has not been able to determine the extent to which the Communist Party and foreign spies directed by Moscow participated in the rebellion. The Communist-controlled labor union is a major component of the Colombian labor movement. The Communist Party secretly distributed leaflets criticizing President as imitating Hitler's tactics, and encouraging workers to continue the general strike to show resistance to reactionaries and American imperialism.

[Associated Press, Colombian Capital, 12th] Representatives of the countries attending the Pan-American Conference decided last night to continue the meeting here, moving to another location only when it becomes impossible. A statement was issued after the meeting stating, "The representatives of the Ninth International Conference of American States reaffirm the solidarity of the American peoples and their common historical mission of peace, contributing to the progress and happiness of mankind. The countries involved cannot have their beliefs shaken by any temporary changes in any one of them, and therefore decide to continue their important work to fulfill the entrustment of the governments concerned."

### The Soviet Union Will Continue Repatriating Japanese Nationals from May Onward

Tokyo Train and Bus Strike

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] According to an announcement today, Kozulin, the acting Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan, stated in a letter to [omission in original text] that the repatriation of Japanese nationals from various regions of the Soviet Union is scheduled to continue in May.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th] Seven electric railway lines and nine tram lines, as well as all bus lines, in Tokyo went on strike for 24 hours on the 11th, causing a major disruption of transportation in the southwest. There are rumors of a complete strike on the 14th. Workers are demanding a 45 percent wage increase, while management has only agreed to a 15 percent increase.

### Ten Thousand People in London Square Watch Ceremony: Roosevelt Statue Unveiled; A Generation's Great Man Remains in People's Memories Forever

[Reuters, London, 12th] The statue of Roosevelt, built in Grosvenor Square in London, was unveiled on the 12th, the third anniversary of Roosevelt's death, by Mrs. Roosevelt herself. The statue was made by Sir Dick, and is larger than the late President Roosevelt himself. Those participating in the ceremony included the King and Queen of England, Princess Elizabeth and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh, Prime Minister Attlee, wartime Prime Minister Churchill, other wartime leaders, and the U.S. Marine Corps and British Royal Marines. The King gave a short speech, praising the late Roosevelt as a great man of peace and a great citizen of the world, and said that this memorial statue will be a permanent reminder for generations to come of the partnership between the British and American peoples in the dark days of war. Before the ceremony began, Grosvenor Square was surrounded by a crowd six or seven layers deep, and the surrounding windows and balconies were also occupied by people. When Mrs. Roosevelt stepped onto the steps, the entire square was silent. As the lady pulled the rope, the white curtain fell, and the great bronze statue appeared before the public. The horns sounded in unison, and the audience applauded thunderously. The lady then returned to the palace in a car with the King and Queen. U.S. Ambassador Douglas also gave a short speech, saying that this statue is a symbol of Anglo-American cooperation, and there has never been such complete, harmonious, and successful international cooperation in human history. This is the work of two great wartime giants, Churchill and Roosevelt.

### UN General Assembly to Convene Special Session on Friday to Discuss the Trusteeship of Holy Land; U.S. Representative to Revise Proposal Content

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th] Talks are underway behind the scenes here in an effort to avoid a war of words between the United States and the Soviet Union over the position of president of the United Nations Special Assembly. The Special Assembly is scheduled to meet on Friday, and its first task will be to elect a president.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 11th] Hopes for a UN trusteeship over Palestine have dwindled. Representatives of various countries are discussing outside of the meetings the ten measures listed in the U.S. proposal from last Monday, but so far none have yielded any results. Representatives of certain countries and senior officials of the United Nations Secretariat are said to have admitted that trusteeship is no longer sufficient to replace partition as a solution to the Holy Land issue. U.S. Chief Representative Austin, in view of this deadlock, is now planning to make further revisions to the proposal so that it can be accepted by the Security Council and the UN Special Assembly.

### General Chennault on U.S. Policy Toward China

Translated by Our Editorial Department

(17) Hesitation in the Face of Events Leads to Missed Opportunities

When General Stilwell, Commander of the China-Burma-India Theater, finally acknowledged the military crisis in China in 1944, he hesitated between helping to save the American air bases in eastern China and humiliating the Chinese government by not providing supplies to China's defenders. He did not handle either option well.

When he finally approved my request to increase air force supplies in June 1944, I pointed out the need to use B-29s to attack the main base of the Japanese offensive in Hunan, Hankou. I urged immediate action, even making it the first task of the Superfortresses, although their intended job was to begin long-range bombing from advanced bases in western China.

At a meeting held in my headquarters on June 6, Stilwell half-accepted this suggestion. My intention was that the Fourteenth Air Force would follow up the attacks by the Superfortresses, bringing its full force to bear on the enemy, helping to break the Japanese base, and assisting the Chinese army in organizing an effective defense in Hunan.

When I suggested that the B-29s take direct action, Stilwell said that he would handle the matter at his headquarters in Burma.

He did ask for instructions from Washington, but his approach did not indicate that there was no other way to expedite matters besides seeking instructions from Washington. In fact, the B-29s did not bomb Hankou until six months later, by which time the Japanese had already opened a mainland corridor through eastern China. Later, even though the B-29s' bombing was very successful, it was only a case of locking the stable door after the horse had bolted.

However, Stilwell did declare a state of emergency in China on June 8. At that time, it was necessary to mobilize almost all available supplies and transportation. However, due to the long-standing neglect of transportation within China, especially the disrepair of the transportation line from Kunming, the terminal of the Hump air transport, to the air bases in Hunan Province, this last-minute effort was also ineffective.

Therefore, it became necessary to send B-24s from the 7th Bombardment Group in India to transport fuel eastward. A large amount of gasoline was consumed in air transport, whereas if land transport had been available, this gasoline could have been used for combat operations to counter the Japanese offensive.

The inability to maintain the eastward transportation line forced us to withdraw our few medium bombers in eastern China, and to limit the activities of fighter planes to the defense of air bases, even though at that time—from July 23 to August 8—the Battle of Hengyang was at its peak, urgently requiring air support, and it was only with air support that this strategic center might have been saved.

On the first day of the siege of Hengyang, I suggested giving 1,000 tons of light automatic weapons and several kinds of infantry weapons of the Fourteenth Air Force to General Xue Yue. I was convinced that if he could be given a small amount of assistance, he would continue to fight.

The Theater Headquarters carefully considered this suggestion. Then Stilwell acknowledged the need to take drastic action, but his intention was to take over command of the Chinese army.

According to news from Chongqing, Stilwell rejected my suggestion. The Theater Headquarters issued a rather vague message, saying that Stilwell was drafting a "proposal" that would humiliate the central government, and that he was unwilling to assist the ground forces in eastern China until his proposal was accepted.

At the same time, officials at the Theater Headquarters in Chongqing began to casually talk about how the Fourteenth Air Force was responsible for defending eastern China without getting help from the Chinese, and that was how the crisis was created.

This casual talk completely ignored the record of my past warnings and requests. In addition, people from the Theater Headquarters casually talked at a banquet at the British Embassy in Chongqing about the Chinese side's "plans to withdraw the wartime capital." One talkative American officer speculated whether the Chinese government would move inland or to New Delhi.

In the second half of July, while Hengyang was putting up a heroic resistance, I requested that transport planes be dispatched to drop ammunition and medical supplies to the defenders of Hengyang, in response to their repeated requests. In answering this request, Stilwell summarized his past attitude towards China and its difficult situation. He said that the result of dropping supplies from the air would be to cause requests for more supplies to be dropped, which could not be met, so he was unwilling to provide planes.

In late July, the Theater Headquarters' attitude was that eastern China had already been lost, and that was how it was officially stated. The Theater Headquarters, ignoring the fact that it had not given material assistance to the troops in eastern China and its neglect of land transport to the point of relying on air transport, thought that the time had come to once again implement "threats, requests, condemnations, and discourteous treatment" towards China. But even the time to do these things was already gone.

The Theater Headquarters had planned to increase the supply of goods transported by land to eastern China to 6,000 tons per month starting in September. If this could have been done earlier, the Japanese offensive could have been checked. But the problem had been delayed for too long.

Eastern China was ultimately lost.

### Prime Minister Schuman Explains French Policy Toward Germany; Opposes Highly Centralized System

[Reuters, Paris, 11th] Prime Minister Schuman addressed the People's Republican Party Congress in Seine-et-Oise on the 11th, stating that the French government supports the establishment of a West German government after the merger of the three zones, but France still insists that each state within this government should enjoy a high degree of autonomy. Schuman said that the main characteristic of the French government's policy is to be in line with reality, so France has expressed its willingness to assist in the establishment of an international organization that can serve as a major factor for peace. However, France will be one of the vital participants in this policy, not just an echo. Regarding the German issue, a distinction must be made between present and future issues, as well as transitional and definitive solutions. In seeking a new organization for Germany, the existence of the German states must not be forgotten, and it must not be allowed to become a highly centralized nation. The German states have geographical and ethnic differences, and a highly centralized and unified Germany often creates totalitarian regimes. Schuman continued, "France hopes to retain its rights over Germany, continue to remain in Berlin, and demand reasonable compensation and adequate security guarantees. If the four powers fail to reach an agreement, France will be one of the other three powers. France does not want mutually hostile blocs, but France believes that the solution must be able to be obtained in any case.

### Daily Necessities Rationing System; Steering Committee Principally Decided; Provisionally Adding Eight Types; Commissioning Factory Manufacture; Establishing Deliberation Committee to Handle Purchase and Distribution Matters

[Our Own Dispatch] The Social Affairs Bureau, in order to stabilize the cost of living index, suggested that various factories cooperate in distributing daily necessities to workers. After the establishment of a research association on the compilation of the cost of living index, it organized a daily necessities rationing steering committee after convening talks with various related daily necessities trade associations last week. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the steering committee held its first meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau. Attendees included Department Head Ding Bingyuan of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, Labor Department Head Shen Ding, Section Chief Zou Jinkui of the Third Section, as well as representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the Cotton Textile Guild of the Six Districts, the Soap Industry, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry, the Underwear Industry, the Knitting Industry, the Tree-Chopping Industry, the Shanghai Cooperative Society Federation, and more than ten other individuals. It was decided in principle that, according to the types and quantities of daily necessities specified in the compilation of the cost of living index, the need would be assessed, and a commission order method would be used to entrust factories to manufacture the goods, which would then be distributed to the workers. In addition to the rice, oil, sugar, and coal balls originally rationed by the government, the types of goods to be rationed provisionally include cloth (divided into local cloth and colored cloth), table salt, soy sauce, firewood, matches, socks, cigarettes, and soap. The quantity of goods to be rationed will be based on the quantity and weighting factors specified in the compiled cost of living index. In order to handle purchase and distribution matters, the steering committee decided to establish a daily necessities purchase and distribution deliberation committee. Its tasks are: (1) To review whether the manufacturing factories meet the conditions. (2) To assess whether the finished products meet the standards. (3) To review the prices of daily necessities. The organization of the committee will involve participation from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Civil Food Allocation Committee, the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the Central Cooperative Treasury, the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and relevant trade associations related to daily necessities. Detailed measures will be further discussed at a meeting to be held on the 20th of this month.

Workers Whose Salaries Are Calculated Based on the Index All Have the Right to Purchase Rations

According to Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian's statement to reporters: All workers in this city whose salaries are calculated based on the cost of living index will have the right to purchase rations in the future. As for commercial firms without products to provide for rationing, their workers will still have their salaries calculated based on the cost of living index compiled from the rationed goods. At first glance, it may seem that they only enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations, but if we look at the big picture, the various commercial firms can reduce their expenses, the goods can be sold more cheaply, and the general public can also benefit. Therefore, this is not just a matter for factories and workers, but also a matter related to all citizens of the city. As for cement plants and others without daily necessities to provide for rationing, if factories that manufacture daily necessities need to use cement to build houses, the cement plant should offer it at a lower price. In short, it concerns everyone, and mutual cooperation is required. After the Social Affairs Bureau determines the detailed measures for purchase and distribution, it will convene talks with all industrial trade associations in the city to consult and stipulate the obligations that should be fulfilled, in order to seek mutual assistance and cooperation. As for the matter of the government distributing manufacturing raw materials, this is a major matter, and the Social Affairs Bureau cannot handle it.

### 11th Round of Per Capita Sugar Rationing: 24,000 Yuan per Catty

Taiwan Sugar Maintains Original Price for This Round

### Woman Tragically Killed in Overturned Tricycle; Husband Is a Postal Employee; Returning from Sister's Home, She Met Her Death; The Two Perpetrators Remain at Large

[Our Own Dispatch] Regarding the case in which a female passenger was crushed to death by a trolleybus after a tricycle overturned on Beijing West Road the night before last, it has now been learned that the deceased's name is Ding, and that the Ding Menghen business card found on her person actually belongs to the deceased's younger brother. The deceased was originally from Dinghai, 32 years old, married for ten years, and had four children. The youngest child she was holding, named Wei Shi, was only ten months old. The oldest, Wei Ming, is already ten years old. The next, Wei Tai, is seven years old. The third, Wei Shan, is five years old.

On the night of the accident, the deceased's family had not yet received the news. It was not until the next morning that Tang learned of the incident after reading this newspaper. Ding QinFang had been visiting her sister at 49 Fuming Village, Foch Road. On the evening in question, she was preparing to take a tricycle home with her baby when, unexpectedly, she met with misfortune opposite Taiping Garden. However, although Ding and the baby she was holding fell to the ground at the same time, fortunately the baby was unharmed. When reporters visited the bereaved family last night, they witnessed the baby, who had escaped death, still crying for "Mama" despite the grandmother's consolations. The entire family was immersed in an atmosphere of grief and sorrow, which aroused sympathy and indignation.

According to police investigations, there were three trolleybuses traveling south on the night of the accident, and at the same time there were three tricycles traveling north. It is rumored that the deceased was riding in the second tricycle of the three. According to general speculation, the trolleybus that caused the accident may have been Route 24.

Tang Daren told reporters: I hope that those who rode the trolleybus on the day of the accident and those who witnessed the tragic incident can come forward and testify to the truth, to comfort the deceased. He also stated that the driver of the accident-causing trolleybus and the driver of the tricycle have not yet been apprehended, and he further hopes that the police will step up their efforts to arrest them, so that the perpetrators will not remain at large.

### Wanli Ship Runs Aground in Fog off North Shengshan Island; All Passengers Rescued and Landed

The Wanli Express Ship, owned by Fumin Steamship Company, is a regular passenger and cargo ship plying between Shanghai and Tianjin, converted from a British escort warship. The ship sailed from Tianjin back to Shanghai on the morning of the 11th. Unexpectedly, at 10:05 AM yesterday, the Shanghai Coast Radio received a distress call from the Wanli ship, stating that it had run aground due to sudden fog near North Shengshan Island at approximately 37.25 degrees north latitude and 122.41 degrees east longitude. All of the more than 400 passengers on board were urgently awaiting rescue.

### Yan Peixing Couple Dispute, Civil Court Hears Case Yesterday, Is He Really Crazy?, Judge Finds it Difficult to Decide, Two Doctors to be Called for Questioning

[Our Dispatch] The dispute between Yan Peixing, the male protagonist of the "Mystery of Madness," and his wife Yuan Baoying, was heard for the first time in the Civil Division of the District Court yesterday. Yuan accused Yan of mental loss and neurasthenia, and applied to the court to declare him legally incompetent. Yan arrived at the court yesterday morning with a new haircut and a rosy complexion. Yuan Baoying wore a bun, her face was sallow and thin, with three gold teeth, wearing a black silk cheongsam and bound feet. Both sides retained three lawyers to defend them. The plaintiff's side first hung a large dragon flag on the court wall. The background of the drawing was blue. A sun painted with white powder was in the upper right corner along with ten rays of light. Below the sun was a giant dragon painted with white powder with the words "Heavenly Dragon Lord, Great True Righteousness" written above it, and "Fang Yi" beside it. Many people who heard the news went to listen yesterday, and the small Civil Division 11 was overcrowded.

Eight Pieces of Evidence Presented

Presiding Judge He Xianzhang first questioned Yuan Baoying. Yuan spoke in pure Wuxi dialect, rapidly and incoherently. Halfway through her statement, she suddenly covered her face and cried loudly. She said that the young couple came from Wuxi empty-handed and founded Huaxing Textile and Hardware Factory in the 26th year. In the 29th year, they founded Shengda Factory, and last year, they founded Xingye Steel Wire Heald Factory. Because her husband suffered from mental illness from time to time, he could not manage the factory affairs, resulting in huge losses, so she reported to the police station and sent him to the Puji Hospital psychiatric hospital for treatment. Attorney Li Mo also presented eight pieces of evidence, including bizarre photos and documents. And added the explanation: "The first to fifth pieces of evidence can prove Yan Peixing's mental disorder. The sixth to eighth pieces of evidence can prove that Yan cannot handle affairs, so according to Article 14 of the Civil Code, the court may, at the application of his spouse or two of his closest relatives, declare him legally incompetent."

Handcuffed and Injected

Subsequently, Yan Peixing was called to be questioned. This highly watched "madman" stated his case calmly and with great composure. His answers were also very organized. He said that he was tied into a car by men in military uniforms, with a small car leading the way in front. He was driven to Puji Hospital and forcibly labeled as a madman, handcuffed, and given anesthesia injections. He was imprisoned in the hospital for more than forty days. Later, I begged bitterly, and a doctor surnamed Huang stretched out both hands, asking for one billion yuan. I said I didn't have that much cash, and stretched out one hand to bargain for five hundred million yuan. As a result, he allowed me to communicate with the outside world. I wrote a letter to my sister in my hometown of Wuxi, and Police Chief Zheng of the Garrison Headquarters rescued me. After being discharged from the hospital, I asked Dr. Han, a mental health authority at Gongji Hospital, to examine me and proved that I had no mental illness. I presented Dr. Han's certificate in court.

Answered One by One

He went on to say that the Huaxing, Shengda, and Xingye factories were all operated and managed solely by himself. He also said that the requirement of "being unable to handle one's own affairs" in the declaration of incompetence was not met. He also answered the evidence presented by the plaintiff one by one: (1) The photo of his wife Yuan Baoying worshiping was taken at Yuan's request as a memento of reconciliation. (2) The warrant was from Guanfang. (3) The Heavenly Dragon was used as a trademark. The defendant's lawyer, Zhou Xiaoshan, stood up and said: After the court's one-hour interrogation of the defendant, his answers were orderly and showed no signs of mental illness. His wife, Yuan Baoying, has carefully collected all the games and brushstrokes over time, which shows that she has been planning for a long time, purely out of malice. It is obvious that this case is an organized and planned scheme to seize money and property. The court will question Dr. Huang Yingbang of Puji Hospital and Dr. Han of Gongji Hospital in this case and adjourned for further trial.

### Tongji University Student Unrest Case Concludes; Students Request Early Resolution Due to Impending Graduation; Court Orders All to be Returned to Custody; Sentence to be Announced on the 16th

[Our Dispatch] The court heard the case of students of Tongji University being accused of assaulting Mayor Wu, which began at 9:00 AM yesterday and concluded with closing arguments at around 1:00 PM. The sentencing has been scheduled for the morning of the 16th. Yesterday, the court was heavily guarded. One squadron of riot police and all court police officers were deployed to maintain order. Admittance required a spectator's pass. However, students from various schools did not arrive in groups, and the number of spectators was less than last time, so the order was exceptionally good. At 9:00 AM, Judge Hu Zhichao, accompanied by Prosecutor Gu Ruilin, ascended the bench in Criminal Division 2 and ordered the defendants Huang Kelu, Pan Chengbang, Feng Liwen, Wang Zhongshu, Wang Weixin (front row), Zhang Jingyao, Xiong Zonglie, Wang Gongwei, Zhou Yongzhi, Sun Kejia, and Qu Yuping (back row) to be brought into court. Witnesses Zhang Jugong, Jiang Hong, Zhu Huiru, and Liu Shuangqiu were summoned, but only Zhang Jugong arrived. After Judge Hu briefly questioned him, Prosecutor Gu stood up to deliver his indictment, stating that the defendants were all young students and had no major malice, and requested leniency. Then each defendant began to argue his case. Huang Kelu argued, "The members of the Student Self-Government Association represent the opinions of the students and execute the decisions of the General Assembly, and there was no intention to incite." Pan Chengbang denied assaulting the mayor. Feng Liwen said, "The members of the Self-Government Association were elected from the bottom up. The petition was the public opinion of the students, and there was no incitement." Wang Zhongshu said: "Huang and Ma's views are the same." Wang Weixin said: "I am not a member of the Self-Government Association. The commander-in-chief of the petition delegation to Nanjing was temporarily appointed, it was just a formality and did not issue any marching orders." At this time, Mayor Wu's adjutant, Zhang Jugong, suddenly arrived in court to testify, first pointing out that the five defendants Feng Liwen, Pan Chengbang, Wang Weixin, Qu Yuping, and Sun Kejia were present at the scene at the time. When pointing to Qu Yuping, he blurted out his name. Because Qu had taken off his glasses, Zhang was not sure, and pointed to Wang Weixin as Qu. At that time, Qu's defense lawyer, Yu Chengxiu, stood up and asked, "Who exactly is Qu Yuping?" Zhang ultimately misidentified him as Qu, and then said, "Because two months have passed, I don't remember clearly. I can only prove that these five people were all present at the scene, as for who laid hands on the mayor, I dare not definitively prove it. Inspector Zhu Yifu of the police station and I were always together protecting Mayor Wu." At this point, the debate continued. Zhang Jingyao said: "What I was holding was the flag of the 3rd Detachment, not the flag of the petition delegation." Xiong Zonglie said: "I did not participate in the petition, I did not shout slogans, and I am only two months away from graduation, please resolve this matter as soon as possible." Wang Gongwei said: "I have been expelled from the school and have been detained for more than two months. According to the witness's testimony, the defendant was not present at the scene. I request compensation for all academic and spiritual losses." Zhou Yongzhi denied assaulting the mayor. Sun Kejia said: "I am a student at St. John's University. Because Wang Zhenli, a classmate at St. John's, was arrested, I asked Mayor Wu about it. Mayor Wu had agreed to release him. At this time, the police cavalry suddenly charged, and the order was in chaos. Because I was not feeling well, I dodged aside and did not assault the mayor at all." Qu Yuping said: "I had no motive to hit the mayor, nor did I take any action to hit the mayor." After all the defendants had argued their cases, the defense lawyers stood up to defend them. The court ruled that the case would be sentenced on the 16th. The defendants' request for bail was denied, and they were returned to custody.

Except for the Blue Phoenix, which rose by 2 million, the other 40s yarns hovered in a weak state. Except for the Double Horse and Big Airship, which fell, all the other 20s yarns rose by 1 million to 5 million each.

The cotton cloth market fluctuated narrowly yesterday, and trade was quiet. The demand from guest merchants was very scarce, and cloth merchants successively locked in profits. Dyeing factories had little interest, and only individual retail investors bought at low prices. When it was about to close, news of bullish buying spread frequently, and the market was quite stable. The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth in the morning was 4.85 million yuan, once fell as low as 4.82 million yuan, retail investors bought, and closed at 4.84 million yuan.

### Rayon Fluctuates Narrowly, Factory Silk and Silk Goods are Stable

### Hangzhou New Longjing Arrives in Shanghai

Opening Price 1.6 Million Yuan Per Jin

After being expected for many days among industry peers, this year's Hangzhou Longjing has finally arrived in Shanghai with a hundred or so jin, reporting new prices. The opening price reached its peak, as high as 1.6 million yuan per jin. However, the base is difficult to stand firm. The reason is that at present, all parties are rushing to be the first to sell new tea, and they are all willing to pay high prices. But as more sources arrive later, it is inevitable that the price will fall in a straight line. As for the old goods, the holders are still trying to hold onto them because of the scarcity of goods, so many domestic tea buyers are waiting and seeing. As for export tea, although there is still urgent demand overseas, exporters are hesitant, and the situation is that both entry and exit are scarce, and the trade is greatly reduced. However, the market is still standing firm as before.

In addition, since the Farmers Bank has launched tea loans, tea merchants have benefited greatly. And now it is the season for tea sales, so in recent days, people in the industry have been frequently in need of funds, and hope that it will proceed quickly according to last year's methods, so as not to hinder this year's tea production and sales.

The rice market continues to show weakness. This morning, sellers offered lower prices based on the previous day's falling Shanghai and Wuxi prices, indicating strong selling intentions. The market continued its downward trend from last week, falling further. Due to weak demand locally, sales were slow, leading to a pessimistic outlook. In the South Market, white rice and thin-husked rice each fell by 100,000 yuan, while early rice fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Limited supply of "Yin Bai" rice led to market stabilization. Only unpolished indica rice remained stable. In the North Market, except for high-grade white rice, which remained steady, all other types fell by 50,000 yuan. Special high-grade rice fell below the four million yuan mark. Yesterday, the total arrivals in the North and South Markets were 6,752 shi (石, a unit of dry measure).

Flour

Flour prices followed the downward trend of rice prices, further depressed by the weak prices in Shanghai and Wuxi. Market sentiment was low, and wholesalers showed no interest, leading to sluggish retail sales. Transactions were small and prices continued to decline. The market was flooded with "Red Bee" brand flour, and selling by small retailers caused prices to fall by 55,000 yuan. "Battleship" and "Old Car" brands each fell by 40,000 yuan, while miscellaneous brands were relatively stable. Bran, in contrast to flour, rose in price due to rumors of purchases by the China Trust Bureau. Large bags of bran jumped by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, while wheat prices remained unchanged.

Grains

Mixed fortunes were seen in the grains market. Although local demand for soybeans was weak, demand from wholesalers kept prices stable. Transactions of Pinghu black beans had been lacking for a long time, but yesterday they traded at 3 million yuan, with supply and demand for selected green beans being equal. Red sorghum and corn initially remained steady but later fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Tea beans were mediocre. Sesame seeds saw inquiries from dealers in Tianjin, pushing prices up by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were bought by dealers from Guangdong, increasing prices by 200,000 to 400,000 yuan.

Cooking Oil

The market trended downward. Due to increased arrivals, the price of raw oil fell more than that of soybean oil. Qingdao "Ji" brand raw oil was priced at 9.65 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan. Jiangbei "Ji" brand raw oil initially traded at 9.45 million yuan. Soybean oil factories rarely offered new supplies, and recycled soybean oil traded at 8 million and 8.05 million yuan, a decrease of about 50,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell by 50,000 yuan, while small-batch sesame oil remained stable. Soybean cakes were bought by dealers from Quanzhou, who favored large-batch cakes, leading to a price of 990,000 yuan. All other soybean cakes remained stable.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, April 12th] Hang Liwu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Education, stated at 5:00 PM on the 11th regarding the recent petitions from various colleges and universities regarding treatment and public funding issues: (1) Regarding the requests from various schools to improve treatment and grading issues, the government has adjusted treatment according to the cost of living index in various regions in April. The grading of each region is determined according to local prices, and the Ministry of Education can only make recommendations within the realm of what is possible.

Recently, many people have been advocating a "No Spitting Campaign." One can see signs prohibiting spitting in the streets and alleys. It is evident that Shanghai people are beginning to learn about hygiene. This is a more progressive expression in the democratic tide, and it is worthy of our support.

However, in this "No Spitting Campaign," many people will naturally raise many questions: "Why is it bad to spit when one has phlegm in the throat?" "What harm does spitting on the ground cause?" "What bacteria does phlegm contain?" "What dangers do these bacteria pose to people?" If these questions cannot be answered in detail, then relying solely on posting signs will not be effective. Therefore, I have specifically written this short article to respond to this "No Spitting Campaign."

We all know that spitting on the ground is not good. However, it is really difficult to bear having phlegm stuck in the throat without spitting it out, so many people spit it out even though they know it is not good. This stems from the automatic action of the respiratory tract expelling secretions, which is unavoidable. However, we must also understand that the production of phlegm is due to excessive secretion by cells in the lungs and the mucous membrane of the trachea. Although there are many causes for this excessive secretion (such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, emphysema, bronchitis, tracheitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, etc.), some can transmit germs to others, causing nearby friends to suffer from the same disease, while others may not transmit germs to people. However, because the germs contained in phlegm are sometimes very serious, and we have no way to distinguish whose phlegm contains germs and whose phlegm is free of germs, we hope that everyone will refrain from spitting phlegm on the ground casually to avoid transmitting germs to others. If one must spit phlegm, then it is best to spit it into a spittoon or into a small handkerchief brought along, and then find a way to disinfect it. As for people who frequently need to spit phlegm, we advise them to immediately seek medical treatment, because healthy people do not have phlegm.

Someone might ask me, "What harm does spitting phlegm on the ground cause?" This question is easy to answer. After phlegm is spat on the ground, it is dried by sunlight and absorbed by the air, naturally becoming phlegm residue. This phlegm residue is very light and floats in the air with dust. Although some of the germs in it have died due to sunlight and air drying, most of the germs still have the ability to live. If this phlegm residue is inhaled into the lungs, then the germs in it can certainly make people sick. Therefore, phlegm cannot be spat on the ground.

As for what germs are in phlegm? According to bacteriologists, there can be a great many germs in phlegm. Although many germs in phlegm spat on the ground have died due to sunlight and air drying, the remaining germs, such as diphtheria bacilli, tubercle bacilli, plague bacilli, glanders bacilli, anthrax bacilli, meningitis bacilli, pertussis bacilli, influenza viruses, measles viruses, smallpox viruses, and scarlet fever bacteria, are already enough to make us suffer. Therefore, we must never forget the highly contagious nature of phlegm spat on the ground, and we must be vigilant at all times, find ways to avoid it at all times, and eliminate it at all times.

Regarding the issue of phlegm disinfection, I think it can be discussed in several ways. For example, for phlegm in a handkerchief, it is best to boil it in hot water for twenty or thirty minutes. If it is phlegm in a paper bag, then it is best to burn it, because it is done once and for all; burning it burns everything away. As for using disinfectant to disinfect, there are considerable difficulties, because the presence of protein in phlegm makes it very difficult to disinfect. If a 5% "Lysol" solution is used, it must be soaked for twelve hours to achieve disinfection. Other disinfectants also require waiting for more than ten hours to be effective. The difficulty of using disinfectants is thus evident.

Finally, regarding coughing, I think it is necessary to remind everyone. Because coughing can transmit various germs more severely, and the general public is careless, coughing casually in public places (such as theaters, lecture halls, trams, buses, and trains, playgrounds, etc.) exposes others to many germs (such as cholera vibrio, pneumonic plague bacillus, influenza viruses, diphtheria bacilli, pneumococci, and tubercle bacilli, etc.) that can be directly inhaled into the lungs through droplets, thus causing illness, which is truly extremely dangerous. According to examinations by bacteriologists and hygiene experts, germs can be transmitted to others within a distance of two or three meters during a single cough. Also, one drop (one-thousandth of a gram) of phlegm can contain 5,000 to 100,000 tubercle bacilli. The severity of coughing in terms of transmission is thus evident. When infectious diseases are prevalent, people in Europe and America often wear masks, both to prevent transmission from others and to avoid transmitting to others. This is the most hygienic method. Since Chinese people do not have the habit of wearing masks, covering one's mouth with a hand or a handkerchief when coughing is a relatively proper measure.

Complaints of a Rural Doctor by Chen Guanyi

I previously read the articles by Mr. Hua Xiren and Mr. Xu Jin in the "New Medicine and New Drugs Weekly" section of Shen Bao about the issue of medical personnel going to rural areas, which were wonderfully detailed. My relative, a doctor, practices medicine in a county on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. His clinic and my residence are in the same household. Based on my actual observations, I venture to write about the joys and hardships of a rural doctor.

In terms of habits, people in Shanghai refer to nearby foreign areas, whether they are towns or counties, as the countryside. However, people in towns and counties are accustomed to referring to farming villages as the countryside and do not consider themselves to be in the countryside. The so-called medical personnel going to the countryside must refer to towns and counties. Truly rural areas, with only a few households or dozens of households, naturally cannot sustain a doctor's practice. There are many villages surrounding each town and county, ranging from a few miles to ten or twenty miles away, connected by waterways or small roads. The towns and counties serve as exchange points for agricultural and industrial products. In addition to local residents, doctors' practices rely heavily on farmers from the villages.

Doctors in counties and cities must first endure a life without material civilization, such as cars, electricity, running water, electrical appliances, Western-style houses, etc. Secondly, if the area for house calls is in the countryside, patients who can reach waterways will naturally use boats to transport the doctor, but they are all without awnings, and the doctor must be able to withstand wind and sun. For those without access to waterways, the doctor must exert his legs, for a distance of five or ten miles, which is uncertain. However, the house call fee is only a meager amount, perhaps not much higher than the standard consultation fee in Shanghai. Rural areas are poor and cannot be compared to large cities.

Most counties and cities in the interior lack hospitals. Even if there are, they are hospitals in name only but private clinics in reality, with a pitifully small scale. Pharmacies only sell common over-the-counter drugs, and most drugs are unavailable, with no prescription services. Therefore, doctors must prepare various drugs themselves and must also know how to mix and prepare medicines. The situation where a doctor can diagnose a patient and give him a prescription to finish the matter, as in Shanghai, is not feasible in the interior. One must be able to treat many subjects, preferably internal and external medicine, as well as ophthalmology, otolaryngology, gynecology, pediatrics, etc. The examination and culture of patients' stool, urine, pus, sputum, and bacteria, etc., cannot be resolved because there are no laboratories. For the diagnosis of the condition, one can only rely on experience and other symptoms to determine, which is very inconvenient. In addition, X-rays and electrotherapy equipment and major and minor operations cannot be performed due to the lack of necessary equipment and can only be politely declined. Also, for private clinics to stock medicines, it is impossible not to stock certain drugs. However, it may be many months without the opportunity to use the drug. If it is stored for a long time without being used, it is easy to spoil, unlike hospitals or pharmacies, which can constantly introduce new products due to the large number of patients. Furthermore, some villagers are accustomed to consulting traditional Chinese medicine first when they are sick. If the treatment is ineffective, they resort to witchcraft. Only after the condition becomes serious do they consult Western medicine, with high expectations. However, at this time, treatment is often difficult to succeed. The above are all the hardships of rural doctors.

As for the joys, in large ports such as Beijing and Shanghai, because there are too many doctors, the supply exceeds demand. Except for a small number, many doctors do not have a regular and stable income from their practices and often worry about making a living. However, in the interior, there are too few doctors, so there are generally no problems in terms of medical practice. In large cities, ordinary patients or dignitaries often lack respect and trust in most doctors due to their arrogance or the bad impression created by the behavior of one or two unscrupulous doctors who value money over ethics. They are also prone to belittling clinics that are slightly old and narrow or doctors who lack a grand demeanor. However, people in the interior mostly have great respect and faith in doctors. They rarely interfere with treatment, and after recovery, they often feel grateful to the doctors, treating them like friends. It is not the case that they become strangers after one parting. It is more convenient to find a house than in Shanghai, and the air is fresh, the residence is quiet, the social life is simple, the people's hearts are less cunning, and it is easy to deal with, unlike Shanghai, where there are thorns everywhere and unpredictable changes.

The above is just a rough outline. If the country can achieve peace, political clarity, and rapid construction in the future, and material civilization facilities such as roads, highways, water and electricity, and modern enterprises such as hospitals and pharmacies are widely developed, then doctors practicing medicine in the interior can reduce many difficulties, and it will be easier to protect the health of the nation.

Academic Learning, Scholarship and Democracy by Xie Youwei

As the National Assembly is in session, seeking to lay the foundation for democracy in our country, it seems necessary for those of us engaged in academic study to say a few words. Whether we are satisfied or dissatisfied with this conference, at the very least, it is a manifestation of democratic politics in form. We should recognize the significance of this conference with the spirit of seeking truth in academic study, a spirit unswayed by partisan views or prejudices, and strive to lay an unshakable foundation for democracy in our country.

People in academic circles are rich in ideals. People rich in ideals are often dissatisfied with reality. Due to dissatisfaction with the current reality of politics, we can easily transfer this dissatisfaction to this conference. This is natural and not surprising. However, we must know that academic thought and democratic politics are mutually causal and mutually needed. Without academic thought suitable for the development of democratic politics, democratic politics will not easily occur, not easily grow, and not easily reach the ideal. Conversely, without a democratic political environment suitable for the development of academic thought, academic thought will not have the possibility of being promoted and developed. The author wishes to briefly discuss these two points to inform the people of the country.

Among the countries with modern democratic politics, the most successful is undoubtedly England. The success of English democratic politics is definitely not a matter of a single day but is closely related to English academic thought. Only with English academic study can there be English democracy. It is English academic study that laid the theoretical foundation for English democratic politics. Without the empiricism of Locke and Hume, without the utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill, without the new idealism of Green and Bradley, there would be no English democracy today, or at least, there would be no such success as today. For what democratic politics emphasizes is individual equality, individual freedom, and the full and complete development of the individual. In other words, it is individualism. Democratic politics can be said to be the politics of individualism. Without regard for the individual, without obliterating the individual, there is no democratic politics to speak of. English empiricism and utilitarianism are rooted in individualism, and English new idealism is also rooted in individualism. However, the former refers to the individual as a separate and independent entity, while the latter refers to the individual as inseparable from the group. Liberalism and capitalism arise from empiricism and utilitarianism; Liberalism also arises from new idealism, but individual freedom must be slightly restricted by the group and must take into account the welfare of the whole. In this way, capitalism cannot use freedom as an excuse and must be subject to state control. The ability of English democratic politics to shift from emphasizing political democracy to also emphasizing economic democracy can be said to be the credit of new idealism. Empiricism and utilitarianism laid the foundation for political democracy in England, while new idealism laid the foundation for economic democracy in England. Is this not clear evidence that academic study helps democracy?

Conversely, without the environment of English democratic politics, there would be no English academic study, and there would be no such rich and brilliant academic study. The most important condition for the development of academic study is freedom, the freedom of thought for thinkers. Without freedom of thought, there is no academic study to speak of. Prescribing a certain kind of thought and only allowing thinkers to think within this thought system is not freedom of thought. Any thought system or any theory is an object of thought for thinkers. Its rightness or wrongness can only be determined through the thinker's reflection. It is absolutely impossible to force thinkers to accept a thought system without their reflection. This is thought control, is the suicide of thought, and is definitely not freedom of thought.

For the development of academic thought, thinkers must have the freedom to contemplate any thought system. Even ideas that we usually consider incorrect and harmful should be allowed to be contemplated by thinkers to a certain extent. For example, the doctrines of Hegel and Marx are considered by some to be anti-democratic, erroneous and harmful. But in the democratic political environment of England, Marx was able to freely complete his Capital in London, and Hegel could also be studied and welcomed in England. By doing so, the British government did not become communist or dictatorial but instead fostered many scholars with learning and thought. If England were not democratic but dictatorial, like fascism, then Marx would have been expelled, and Hegel's works would have been banned. Many famous British scholars, such as Green, Bradley, Russell, and Laski, would not have had the possibility of appearing. Is this not clear evidence that democracy helps academic study?

Therefore, what the author hopes of the academic community is to vigorously promote and cultivate academic thoughts related to democracy; what I hope of the National Assembly representatives and government figures is to strive to create an environment that facilitates the development of academic study. In the current environment, it is impossible to talk about academic study. The academic community is suffering from making a living, too busy saving lives to spare time for academic pursuits. However, if we talk about democracy without talking about academic study, then democracy is also empty.

The Nature of Aristotle's Thought by Yan Qun

There are two aspects of Aristotle's thought that are worth noting:

(1) Regarding inheritance from Plato:—The so-called inheritance is not like a wastrel descendant inheriting the ancestral property, not knowing how to manage it himself, and only considering it his duty to preserve it without losing it. Aristotle's inheritance from Plato not only digested what he inherited but also developed it himself. He deeply believed that all phenomena in the universe must be transformed into concepts to become knowledge. This is the part he digested from what he inherited. At the same time, he also felt Plato's shortcomings. These shortcomings were the undertaking that Plato should have done but did not do. Previously, Socrates discovered the need to seek concepts, believing that this was the true method of knowledge, but he was, after all, a beginner and not bold enough, so he only delineated a corner of the human affairs realm as the scope of research. Plato saw this shortcoming and wanted to extend it to the entire universe, but his contribution stopped at discovering that everything in the universe has concepts (which he called Ideals). It must be known that the original intention of seeking concepts is to obtain knowledge. Knowledge is nothing more than an explanation of the vast array of phenomena. Therefore, seeking concepts is to explain those phenomena. Plato already knew that the scope that concepts could explain was not limited to a corner of the human affairs realm, and its use could extend to everything in the universe. However, he only saw it but did not actually do it. Herein lies Aristotle's contribution. He felt that Plato's shortcoming was here, and the unfinished undertaking was also here. Therefore, he assumed this responsibility and actually used concepts to explain everything in the universe. By doing so, he opened the door for science and laid a good foundation. This was his achievement in seizing Plato's territory and developing it himself.

(2) Regarding self-creation:—As said just now, Aristotle's goal was to actually use concepts to explain everything in the universe. How exactly did he explain it? To answer this question, it can be divided into two aspects: (1) The methodological aspect:—Plato's method of learning was dialectics. The form of dialectics is question and answer, and the content is analysis and synthesis, which is actually the embryonic form of induction and deduction. Aristotle carried forward this method, developing it into a specialized methodology called Logic. This was his first step in creation. But he was still dissatisfied. He believed that logic was not enough and that actual observation was also needed to have new discoveries. Although, due to the limitations of the times, he could not use the experimental method commonly used by modern scientists, and he could not collect materials and facts in a controlled environment, he could only observe in a scattered natural environment. However, this alone laid a solid foundation for the scientific methods of later generations. This was his second step in creation. (2) The content aspect:—After Plato discovered that everything in the universe has concepts, he placed the concepts in another world, forming a confrontational relationship with the actual natural world. Aristotle did not think so. He believed that the function of concepts was originally to explain phenomena, but now, on the contrary, separating them from phenomena, with a vast gap between the two, would be equivalent to being useless, equivalent to not having any explanation. Therefore, he pulled the concepts into the natural world and made them truly explain the natural world. He never believed in independent, self-existing Ideals forming another world. At the same time, he firmly believed that everything in the universe can be explained by concepts. He believed that having concepts without facts makes the concepts empty, and having facts without concepts makes the facts meaningless. This was his greatest dedication, because it found a way out for science and a use for philosophy.

Summarizing the above two points, it can be seen that Aristotle's philosophy is rationalism on the one hand and empiricism on the other. The former is the part he inherited from Plato, and the latter is the part he created himself. Empiricism is his means, and rationalism is his purpose. This is the true essence of a scientist. A scientist is not just in the room using reason to explain the universe. Every move he makes must be based on facts obtained from experience. However, everyone often thinks that scientists only describe but do not explain, so what he obtains are only empirical facts. In fact, this view is wrong. Scientists do not always explain, but the phenomena he explains are only local, and the reasons he explains are not final, that is all.

Schopenhauer's Theory of Art by Shaoxiong

Arthur Schopenhauer, a German philosopher of the nineteenth century, was a philosopher who had great research on art. In his philosophical theory, art occupies a very important position. According to his philosophy, he wants to negate life and negate the will to live, and he believes that art is a way to negate the will to live, although not a fundamental way. In art, we can temporarily forget the will to live, we can temporarily obtain liberation and transcendence. This is the main reason why Schopenhauer attaches importance to art. This article does not elaborate on Schopenhauer's artistic aspirations, but only translates a chapter "The Metaphysics of Pure Art" in Schopenhauer's collection of treatises, so that the general reader can get some fundamental concepts of Schopenhauer's theory of art.

In the above-mentioned thesis, Schopenhauer considers that the real question of art philosophy is; how is it possible to obtain pleasure for things that have nothing to do with the will (or desire)? Everyone knows that only when an object has a relationship with our will or desire, or when an object satisfies our purpose, can we have pleasure and enjoyment of this object. So to get pleasure from things that have nothing to do with the will seems contradictory. However, it is obvious that we actually get pleasure and enjoyment from beauty itself, and this is very unrelated to our personal purpose or our will.

Regarding the above contradiction, Schopenhauer proposed his solution. He believes that beauty is the fundamental and original form of animate and inanimate nature. In Plato's words, it is the Ideal (ldeas). To understand beauty and recognize Ideals, it cannot be recognized by ordinary feelings and ordinary functions, but can only be recognized by the subject of knowledge free from the bondage of will. In other words, it can only be recognized by pure intellect without purpose and without desire. Therefore, in the act of perception of beauty, the will has absolutely no place in consciousness. But only the will is the source of all our sorrow and pain. If the will disappears in consciousness, wouldn't the possibility of all pain also disappear? This is the reason why there can be a sense of pleasure accompanying the perception of beauty. If someone says that if the possibility of pain is removed, then the possibility of happiness is also removed, how can one obtain happiness? Schopenhauer's answer is that the nature of happiness is passive. Happiness is just another name for the absence of pain, and only pain is the active element in existence. Therefore, when the will disappears in consciousness, it not only removes pain, but also removes the possibility of pain. What remains is the state of enjoyment, the state of happiness.

The meaning of pure intellect is to free a person from the bondage of self. To obtain pure intellect, we must forget our own purpose and completely immerse ourselves in the contemplation of the object; so that everything we are aware of is only this one object. For example, when we appreciate a beautiful plum blossom, we forget ourselves, forget everything, and only this plum blossom is in consciousness. Such an ability is not something that most people can have, and it is usually not suitable for dealing with the demands of the world. However, the function of art is constituted by this kind of function.

The intelligence of ordinary people exists for the will, works for the will, and is driven by the will. This kind of intelligence is used to make the will aware of and aware of the things around it, to listen to the will, and to satisfy the will's requirements. Therefore, this kind of intelligence does not easily perceive beauty. But suppose that the will temporarily releases the intelligence, lets the intelligence be free, so that the intelligence does not have to do the work of the will, and does not have to do its daily work, then the intelligence after such release becomes pure intelligence. However, this intelligence after release, although free from the work of the will, is not an intelligence that does not work, does not act, and does not strive. This pure intelligence is still active and striving, which explains why artistic creation is so scarce. The intelligence of ordinary people is activated only by the whip of the will. Our thoughts, our efforts, our ability to see and hear, directly or indirectly, are all serving our personal goals, big and small. Our intelligence is activated by the drive of the will. If this drive is removed, our intelligence may also stop acting and stop working as a result. This is the case for most people. The artist is different. The artist's intelligence, although free from the drive of the will, still maintains its activity. After the artist's intelligence is freed from the restraint of the will, on the one hand, it can objectively observe the universe and faithfully reflect life, and on the other hand, it can use principles and methods to select the subject matter - and its expression. Such as the accuracy of the painter in painting and using colors, such as the poet's choice of appropriate words and rhythms, these are all activities of intelligence. Therefore, in the artist's function, the intelligence is pure, free, and active, does not serve the will, but has its own goals for activity. (To be continued)

Random Talks on Academic Learning (70) by Zhang Qiyun

National Character and Education

The traditional Chinese educational thought is the Confucian teaching of the Six Arts. The Six Arts are rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic, among which rites and music are the central concepts of the Six Arts. Confucius said, "What is meant by 'rites, rites'? Is it jade and silk? What is meant by 'music, music'? Is it bells and drums?" When Confucians discuss rites and music, they naturally consider the spirit to be far more important than the material. Music represents empathy between people, and rites represent the distinctions between individuals. Music is what human feelings cannot help but express, and rites are what ethics cannot easily change. The Book of Rites says, "Music is for the common, rites are for the different. The common brings intimacy, and the different brings respect." The Book of Zhou Rites says, "Use rites to teach moderation, and use music to teach harmony." (Volume 3, Di Guan Shang). Confucian thought emphasizes both inner peace, which is the place of sameness and intimacy, and outward order, which is the place of difference and respect. Mutual creation and mutual completion are indispensable. A complete personality and an ideal society must possess both the teachings of rites and music, conforming to emotion and conforming to reason, in order to be considered perfect.

In Confucian thought, within rites and music, special emphasis is placed on musical education, regarding it as the core of education. The Book of Zhou Rites calls the Great Director of Music "to manage the laws of Chengjun, to manage the academic administration of building the state, and to unite the disciples of the state." (Volume 6, Chun Guan Xia). Chengjun is the university, why is the law of the university in charge of the music official? Because Confucians use the word "benevolence" to encompass all virtues, and music and benevolence are one, able to move human relations from the bloodline. Confucius was known for his many skills in his time, and he put particularly diligent effort and interest into music, such as "hearing Shao in Qi, and not knowing the taste of meat for three months," so deep was his immersion. The language of music is poetry, so poetic education is connected to musical education. "Gentle and honest" is the body of poetry, which can also be said to be the body of music. "Inspiring, observing, grouping, and complaining" are the uses of poetry, which can also be said to be the uses of music. Confucian discussions of education mostly start with rites and music, with music being more fundamental than rites. Of the ancient books that speak of music, none are more detailed than the Book of Zhou Rites. The Han people considered the Great Director of Music chapter of the Great Zongbo of the Book of Zhou Rites to be a special book for musicians, and the world then regarded it as the Classic of Music. Since ancient music is lost, what is described in the Book of Zhou Rites can still be seen in its broad outline.

The Book of Zhou Rites has the saying "Building a country must prohibit lewd sounds, excessive sounds, ominous sounds, and slow sounds" (Volume 6, Chun Guan Xia), which is also very meaningful. Our ancient ancestors believed that the way of sound is connected to government, and that there is no better way to change customs than through music. If a country's musical rhythm is dominated by lewd sounds, or loses the rhythm of sorrow and joy, or is negligent and disrespectful, or the sound is a scene of destruction and killing of a country, then its politics will inevitably be affected. The influence of lewd sounds on people gradually deepens, starting with corrupting emotions, then destroying customs, and finally shaking and overturning the major principles and laws of a country. Pure music lies in promoting the virtue of moderation and harmony, regulating emotions and desires, and proceeding in a moderate way. It does not advocate prohibition or destruction, but also does not allow it to tend towards excessive indulgence. The ancients said, "Inspired by poetry, completed by music," the purpose of which is to cultivate a moderate national character, which was a very sound idea.

Archery and dance are also closely linked to rites and music. The function of music lies in being rich in both sound and appearance. It cannot be called music if there is sound without appearance. The musical dance of the Book of Zhou Rites uses dancers with harmonious colors and well-maintained bodies. Its records of ancient music include the past dynasties and the neighboring regions. All the major events and figures that can be commemorated in history have been included. The sound of drums and dancing is inspiring, so it has educational value. Archery is one of the Six Arts, and its purpose is also to advance virtue, not just a technique. The Archery of Rites says, "Therefore, archers must advance and retreat in accordance with the rites, their inner intentions must be correct, and their outer bodies must be straight. Then they hold the bow and arrow firmly and carefully. Only when the bow and arrow are securely tightened can they speak of hitting the target. From this, one can observe virtue." Archery was a major rite in ancient times. Confucius shot at the garden of Juexiang, and the viewers were like a wall. From this, it can be seen that ancient Chinese personality education and physical fitness were extremely important.

The fundamental concepts of Confucianism are correct and sound, but why is there a phenomenon of "the government exists with the person, and the government ceases with the person," resulting in fewer days of order and more days of chaos in history? According to Mr. Sun Zhongrong's view, it is necessary to remedy this in terms of vigorous practice. In the preface to The Essentials of Government in the Book of Zhou Rites, he said, "Do the Han Confucians not say, 'Governing does not lie in many words, but in how vigorously it is practiced'? If we truly reform the current laws, gather our strength and implement them without doubt, then these forty chapters will be more than enough to achieve prosperity and strength. If we cannot do this, then even if people have the strategies of Jia Yi and recite the books of Shema, what use will it be for the pain of ruin?" Therefore, Mr. Zhongrong proposed the view of supplementing the strengths and weaknesses of the two schools of Confucianism and Mohism. The revival of Mohism can be used as a view to supplement the strengths and weaknesses of Confucianism. He believed that the Book of Zhou Rites is the most complete of the classics, so he wrote The Correct Meaning of the Book of Zhou Rites. There is no greater virtue than Mo Di's actions, so he also wrote Leisurely Notes on Mozi. In the preface to Leisurely Notes on Mozi, he said that Mozi's establishment and response to the world have a foundation. His intentions were sincere and courageous in practice, laboring his body and mind to save the world from its ills. His strategies were sufficient to deal with danger and respond to change, and he did not burden his heart with profits and fame. His learning was especially comprehensive in art and science, thoroughly investigating the subtleties of phenomena and numbers (i.e., what is now called science). During the Warring States period, scholars referred to Confucius and Mozi together, and the prosperity of Mohism was almost equal to that of the Confucians. It is a pity that the theories of the Mohists often went to extremes (the theory of non-music is one example), making self-suffering the extreme, which was not easy to gain the sympathy of the world, and even more difficult to practice. This is a major reason why Mohism was interrupted for two thousand years after the Qin and Han dynasties. Mr. Zhongrong rose up in the late Qing dynasty at the time of survival and extinction, advocating the introduction of Mohism into Confucianism, which no Confucian scholar has dared to explicitly say in the past. He did his best to promote the spirit of "not warming the mat and not blackening the chimney," and was able to practice it himself, not just uttering empty words. From the twentieth year of Guangxu to the eleventh year of "★", he worked hard to establish schools in the two prefectures of Wenzhou and Chuzhou, and more than three hundred new schools were established, making his achievements the best in the country. Later, the Zhejiang Provincial Education Association publicly elected Mr. as the chairman, which was truly an honor for the people of Zhejiang. Mr. Zhongrong's original idea was to combine the "Ink" with "Centrality," taking moderate virtue as the foundation, and supplementing it with the spirit of vigorous practice and scientific methods. If this new style of learning can penetrate deeply into the people, I am convinced that it will have a significant contribution to the current nation-building enterprise.

Free Talk About Wine by Chen Yixian

In the March 6th issue of Free Talk, Mr. Yingzhi's article "Red Hair Burning and Shaoxing Yellow" said: "When it is cloudy and boring, gathering three or five old friends to drink in a small building and enjoy oneself to the fullest is also a great thing. However, the price of wine is rising every day, and I am afraid that the poor will not be able to afford it, so it is better to read other people's articles about wine." I am an old man and a drunkard, and I agree with this itching in the throat, so I will briefly describe the good wines I have eaten in my life to relieve the thirst.

In the third and fourth years of the Republic of China, when I was translating paintings in Shanghai, Zhu Guwei, who was sick with Shanshan Xuecheng, lived in Dongyouheng Road, and was known as the three old men of Hongkou. Chen Sanyuan lived in Tangyou Road and often drank with Yu Feiyuan. Feiyuan was the garden of Gan Hanshen, in Zhouyou Road. Every afternoon at four or five o'clock, my brother and I and Mr. Sanyuan, the three old men of Hongkou, often gathered in the garden. The host had a collection of various old brandies and whiskeys, and the guests drank as much as they wanted, without any restrictions, but no dishes were prepared. On the table, in addition to wine bottles and glasses, there was a large plate of Dinghao biscuits and a pot of top-quality Qimen black tea. One could drink tea or wine, as one pleased. The Western wine I have eaten in my life was the best here. Now a bottle of whiskey costs hundreds of millions of yuan, and there is no host like Mr. Gan.

### Minister Zhu Invites National Assembly Members to Discuss Basic Education Funding

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, in order to distribute the basic education subsidy in a fair and effective manner, specially invited many National Assembly representatives with practical experience in local education to a meeting at 2:00 PM on the 11th. Over seventy people attended.
