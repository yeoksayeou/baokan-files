### Smooth Development of the Liaoxi Battle Situation; Bandits from Southern Liaoning Cross the Liaohe River and Flee North to Gather; Siping Airfield Attacked and Repelled

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] Although Siping is tense, apart from the airfield five kilometers west of Siping, which was attacked by bandits on the evening of the 3rd and repelled by the National Army, there have been no major engagements. Furthermore, bandits in the Shenyang-Benxi area have not launched a direct offensive.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] Most of the bandits from Southern Liaoning have crossed the Liaohe River and moved north. Currently, only the 4th Column of bandits and other units are between Benxi and Yingkou in Southern Liaoning, while the 9th Column is in the area south of Xinmin. The remaining columns, including the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 8th Columns, have all reached Northern Liaoning. The bandits' northward movement, in addition to attempting to attack Siping and Jilin-Changchun and to reorganize and replenish their forces, may have other political motives. It is also rumored that over a hundred Soviet military advisors have arrived in Harbin from Boliy. It is further rumored that Lin Biao has decided to enlist several divisions of youths aged fifteen and above for training in Northern Songjiang, hoping to occupy Jilin-Changchun as soon as possible and establish a new military and political center.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 5th] The Liaoxi battle situation is developing favorably. A certain elite corps of the National Army is currently advancing towards the designated area with irresistible force. There are no longer any bandits entrenched in the Xinlitun area, and most of them fled towards Faku on the evening of the 3rd. Our Air Force conducted frequent sorties on the 4th, bombing and strafing extensively around Yingkou, Liaoyuan, and Siping, with significant gains. Furthermore, there have been minor engagements in the Siping area. Over a thousand remnants of the bandits, starting from near Bamiancheng on the night of the 3rd, infiltrated the area west and north of the Siping airfield, but were repelled by the defending troops.

[Joint Press, Beiping, 5th] According to a telegram from the Northeast, the National Army is about to open up a corridor directly to Shenyang. Reinforcements are advancing along the Ping-Shenyang Road from Liaobei, now only a few miles from Xinmin. Once Xinmin is relieved, land transportation from North China to Shenyang can be restored, although repairing the destroyed railway may take several weeks. The Communist bandits previously operating on the Shenyang-Yushu section of the railway have withdrawn to the north of Shenyang, likely due to heavy losses and to avoid being surrounded after the Liaohe River thaws. This shows that the Communist army does not have sufficient strength to capture Shenyang and continues to maintain its consistent policy of avoiding large-scale direct combat.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] A qualified source analyzed the Northeast war situation, stating that the recent northward movement of the bandits' main forces, resulting in a shrinking state, is clearly due to the pressure from the National Army entering the region. From a political perspective, this is the result of the entire nation paying close attention to the Northeast. It is undoubtedly necessary for the Northeast theater to have national support. Although the threat to Shenyang has been lifted, the future remains challenging and dangerous. The bandits' seventh offensive can be said to have come to an end, and their losses have been extremely heavy. The current shrinking is a period of reorganization and replenishment, and it is difficult to conclude that they are at the end of their rope. Their next move deserves close attention. The rapid growth of the Communist bandits in the Northeast has both internal and external factors, and their abundant supplies are a fact that cannot be ignored. Although the Northeast war situation is gradually becoming clearer, the shadows have not disappeared. The bandits' shrinking may be a delaying tactic, and the nation's vigilance should not be diverted.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Luo Zhuoying, Li Zongren, and Fu Zuoyi discussed the military situation in the Northeast in Beiping and have reached a substantial agreement. Luo is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 6th to report back.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Northeast elders Zhang Zuoxiang, Ma Zhanshan, and Wan Fulin left Nanjing by train on the night of the 5th for Shanghai, accompanied by Mo Dehui. Zhang and others will make a brief stop in Shanghai before returning to Beiping. Before leaving, Ma and Zhang met with reporters, answering several inquiries. Zhang and others first stated that the achievements of this trip include: first, the Chairman's assurance that the Central Government will never abandon the Northeast under any circumstances, indicating the Central Government's determination and methods; and second, the issue of organizing local armed forces. They will wait for orders after returning to the North before proceeding with the organization, as the Central Government has no concrete plans. When asked whether they specifically requested Ambassador Stuart to convey the Northeast issue to the U.S. government and seek assistance during their meeting with the Ambassador, they replied that they had not yet, but the Ambassador expressed great concern about the matter. Zhang and others then stated that there are still several unresolved issues that the Northeast petition delegation will continue to negotiate with all parties. They seek only to find opportunities to serve the cause of national salvation and rural revitalization and have no other personal ambitions.

### The Northeast Petition Delegation Runs Around in Nanjing; Has Achieved Results

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Northeast petition delegation, led by Wang Huayi, has been running around in Nanjing, appealing to all parties for four things: sending reinforcements, transporting military supplies, reforming the currency system, and organizing local armed forces. The first two have yielded relatively satisfactory results. Regarding reinforcements, the Chairman has personally promised to allocate troops and has already sought to implement it. Regarding military supplies, the Ministry of Food has replied that 960,000 large bags of grain should be allocated by the end of April of this year, and all have been allocated and shipped. In the future, 120,000 large bags will be allocated monthly without delay, so the new military supply problem has been completely resolved. As for civilian food, the Ministry of Food is also planning separately. Secondly, regarding the issue of circulating currency, Vice President Wang Chonghui promised at a banquet for the petition delegation on the afternoon of the 5th to immediately summon Zhang Jia'ao, the President of the National Bank, to Nanjing to discuss the reform issue, so a considerable solution can also be obtained. As for organizing local armed forces, it still awaits instructions from the Central Government. The delegation has decided not to return to the Northeast without achieving results in their petition, so they will continue their efforts. At the same time, they will continue to maintain contact with Ambassador Stuart. Wang Huayi visited the Ambassador again at around 3:00 PM on the 5th for further talks.

### Ambassador Stuart Visits Foreign Minister Wang; Contents Not Disclosed; Rumored to Be Related to U.S. Aid; The Beijing Municipal Council Sends a Telegram to the Ambassador Requesting U.S. Government Military Aid to China

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] U.S. Ambassador Stuart Leiden visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 5th, and the conversation lasted for a long time, until 4:30 PM.

The telegram stated: "The situation in the Northeast is increasingly tense, and Tianjin and Beiping are under even greater threat. We dare to ask that you make a swift decision, take immediate action, and implement military aid to China so that the Chinese Communists, a link in the global Communist chain, will be quickly overthrown on Chinese soil, thereby strengthening the global anti-Communist situation and preventing the recurrence of another world war. This would not only be fortunate for China, but also for your country, and for all countries and peace-loving people in the world!"

He explained that he was not a military expert and did not know the current state of China's economic development, but he told the committee that he felt that Secretary of State Marshall had taken all factors into account before submitting the China relief plan to Congress.

Agreement and Opposition Vary Greatly

Congressman Judd said: "I believe that General MacArthur's telegram is the most brilliant and powerful statement showing that a free and independent China is of definite importance to U.S. security. I was particularly impressed by his statement that China is the cornerstone of the Pacific arch and his concise metaphor for the unreasonable demand to implement reforms in China, which has undergone eight years of war, during its national crisis." On the other hand, California Democratic Congresswoman Douglas said: "I personally agree to continue to follow Marshall's guidance. I believe that Marshall has a central mind and a whole plan, and his handling of the issue of aid to the world must be whole, not piecemeal." Republican Congressman Lodge said that MacArthur's telegram was "clear and concise," and another Republican Congressman Javits said: "I think economic assistance is more appropriate."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committees held a joint meeting on the morning of the 5th.

On the one hand, to inspire the conscience of the rich, imitate the patriotic spirit of the British during the war, and voluntarily declare their deposits for national use; on the other hand, to make friendly countries understand the position of our people's organizations on the issue of utilizing deposits, and to understand our country's financial situation and assist in this matter within the legal scope. The committee members present agreed with this and spoke up one after another, deciding that Liu and Jian would organize the opinions of the meeting, draft a recommendation, submit it to the next meeting of the Legislative Yuan for discussion and approval, and then submit it to the National Government to order the Executive Yuan to draft effective measures and send them to the Legislative Yuan for review. At the same time, they will continue to intensify negotiations with the United Kingdom and the United States to obtain their agreement and assistance.

### The Signing of the Sino-Hong Kong Customs and Financial Agreement Is Delayed; Parts Regarding Preventing Smuggling and Handling Remittances Have Not Yet Been Implemented

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 5th] Since the implementation of the anti-smuggling part of the Sino-Hong Kong Customs and Financial Agreement, other parts related to preventing smuggling and handling remittances have not yet been implemented.

### This Year's Trade Plan; The Ministry of Economic Affairs Formulates Principles; Divided Into Two Major Departments: Foreign Exchange and Trade Management; Proposes Partial Amendments to the Current Exchange Settlement Methods

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The principles and policies for my country's import and export trade plan for the 37th year have been formulated after detailed research by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Detailed implementation methods are currently being studied and supplemented, and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval once finalized. It is reported that the new plan has proposed partial amendments to the current exchange settlement methods and advocates implementing new exchange settlement methods. The main part of the new plan can be divided into two major departments: foreign exchange and trade management. The main points are as follows:

(A) Foreign Exchange Part: (1) Implement new exchange settlement methods. In the past, all exported materials were settled with the Central Bank. The new plan proposes that, for exported materials that are optimistic about the international market, such as bristles, tung oil, and tea, a maximum of one-third should be settled with the Central Bank. According to estimates in the plan, last year's total exports were about one billion U.S. dollars. If new exchange settlement methods are implemented, this year's exports can reach 200 to 300 million U.S. dollars. If one-third is settled with the Central Bank, the government can obtain about 90 million U.S. dollars annually. In addition, the export estimates of state-owned enterprises can also obtain 90.1 million U.S. dollars. This year, the government can control 180 million U.S. dollars in export-related foreign exchange. (2) The principle of adjusting the foreign exchange reserve should take into account the inflation rate of export materials and the parity of the legal tender's purchasing power abroad. If adjustments are made according to the above principles, the black market can be eliminated and remittances can also be increased. It is estimated that this year can reach about 120 million U.S. dollars. Combined with the 180 million U.S. dollars in export-related foreign exchange, the government can control about 300 million U.S. dollars for construction purposes. (3) The export foreign exchange obtained by exporters, in addition to those settled with the Central Bank, must be used for imports. The method is not specified, and they can import on their own or sell to importers, but it must be completed within six months, and the government is responsible for supervising it. The government should register the foreign exchange obtained from exports for assessment. (4) The government will not provide foreign exchange for imports. The foreign exchange needed by importers can be obtained from export foreign exchange obtained by exporters, remittances, foreign investment, and the assets and deposits of Chinese citizens abroad.

(B) Trade Management Part: (1) Export adopts a free trade policy, and the government does not interfere. (2) Import adopts a controlled policy, stipulating that luxury goods and the like are prohibited from import. In order to protect domestic industry, the import of certain goods may be restricted. The goods subject to import restrictions are temporarily determined according to the situation. Machinery, raw materials, and building materials can be freely imported. (3) Cancel the permit method and simplify import and export procedures.

All have been reviewed and approved. A new agency will be established to be responsible for the implementation of the production increase plan, which will be submitted for discussion at the next regular meeting of the National Economic Council.

Editorial

### Opposing the Strike's Non-Compensation Plan

The American "Foreign Affairs Advisory Association" released a report by 175 members on the 1st of this month, advising the Department of the Army not to remove non-purely war-related industries from Japan for compensation. The drafter of this report was Strike, who advocated anti-reparations. Therefore, the presentation of the Strike Report can be regarded as the presentation of the American anti-reparations plan. China, the Philippines, and Canada are the countries most threatened by Japanese aggression and most eager for Japanese compensation. Naturally, they are also most concerned about the proposal of this anti-compensation plan. The authorities of the ten Far Eastern countries have not yet made a clear statement on the American "trial balloon", and will probably reserve it until the Far Eastern Commission meeting before formally expressing their attitude. However, according to the Associated Press, at least four or five of the eleven Far Eastern countries will express their opposition, including China and the Philippines, as well as New Zealand, the Commonwealth of Australia, and India. Only defeated Japan reported with joy after the publication of the Strike Report. They thanked Strike for his broad-mindedness and hoped that this plan would be established as soon as possible, allowing Japan to win a victory in defeat.

According to reports, Strike is the chairman of the American McGraw Company and also an advisor on compensation issues to the Department of the Army. After the Pauley Plan was passed by the Far Eastern Commission, the Department of the Army and MacArthur Headquarters believed that the amount of compensation claimed from Japan by the Pauley Plan was too "strict". The Department of the Army then ordered Strike to go to Japan to serve as chairman of the Special Committee on Compensation, representing the Army to investigate the situation in Japan, and preparing to draft a "lenient" compensation plan. In January of last year, Strike drafted a proposal, which was said to be only about 30% of Pauley's plan, and the details were never published. General MacArthur believed that both the Pauley Plan and the Strike Plan were difficult to implement, so the Allied Headquarters drafted another plan for the Army Department to refer to. The MacArthur Plan completely ignored the political significance of compensation. In order to reconcile the above plans, the Department of the Army re-determined the amount of compensation to be claimed from Japan, and again ordered Strike to be responsible for drafting a "lenient" plan. In July of last year, Strike, in his capacity as the head of the "Foreign Affairs Advisory Association," led a team of technical experts to Tokyo to study Japanese issues, and once came to to search for reference materials, completing the on-site investigation in December and returning home. Before going to Japan for investigation, Strike wrote an article for "America Magazine" entitled "Revenge is Waste," advocating overturning Pauley's compensation plan, canceling the resolution passed by the Far Eastern Commission in May 1946, and re-establishing a relatively high level of Japanese industry so that she could stand up in the world. Based on this high level, Japan should not pay compensation, so that the United States could reduce its burden. His conclusion stated: "The United States must immediately find a way to cancel the Far Eastern Commission's recommendations because it cannot make Japan self-sufficient." Based on this erroneous anti-compensation theory and the results of his investigation in Japan, this newspaper published an editorial in September of last year to refute it. However, Strike continued to do his own thing, and on the 1st of this month, he published this new plan. He strongly advocated retaining Japanese industry, believing that removing all Japanese industrial equipment other than basic war industrial equipment would hinder world production and reduce Japan's possibility of achieving self-sufficiency.

The "Strike Report" has not yet been submitted to the Far Eastern Commission for publication, which is obviously an American "official probe" to understand the opinions of the other ten Far Eastern countries. However, we believe that the "Strike Report" is not a "compensation plan" but a political plan to support Japan's revival. If this plan is allowed to develop, not only will Japan's wartime economy recover immediately, but also the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission and the terms of the Potsdam Declaration will immediately become waste paper. Under any circumstances, we must express our opposition. Now we further state the reasons for our opposition:

First, we that the Potsdam Declaration must obtain compensation. According to international law and precedent, compensation is the duty of the defeated countries, and the victorious countries' claim for compensation is a right. Our China has suffered the longest from Japanese aggression, and public and private property and materials have been destroyed and removed. We must obtain compensation and restitution. We hope that the peace conference with Japan will be convened as soon as possible in order to obtain compensation and rapidly develop China's industry. At the same time, on the other hand, we can prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression. In short, whether China can obtain Japanese compensation is a major issue concerning China's centuries of fate. We against non-compensation, oppose Japan's high level of industry, and against the conspiracy of "Japanese industry and Chinese agriculture". The Potsdam Declaration clearly stipulates that: "Japan shall be allowed to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to rearm for war." In other words, all industries that are not necessary to maintain the lives of the Japanese people and pay for reparations in kind, especially military industries, should be dismantled and used for compensation. The "Strike Report" suggests retaining about two-thirds of Japanese pig iron, steel plates, steel bars, sulfuric acid, merchant ships, etc., using about one-third for compensation, and retaining all textile industry and other heavy industrial machinery and tools. Obviously, it completely retains Japan's military industry and does not dismantle war industrial equipment, which violates the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration.

First, we must put forward our own views and ask the Far Eastern countries to agree that the consistent view of our country is that Japan's revival will inevitably threaten China's security. Strike's plan is clearly aimed at promoting Japan's accelerated revival, so the government attaches great importance to this. It has also revised the table of restrictions on Japanese industrial levels. According to the decision of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference: all aviation and military industries should be completely destroyed, and railways and heavy industries should be gradually reduced; in the textile industry, it should be reduced to a considerable amount. In order to prevent Japan's resurgence from engaging in aggression, the criteria determined by our government are both necessary and reasonable; it should argue reasonably with the Far Eastern Commission, and will not stop until the goal is achieved. Fortunately, Strike's plan has not yet been approved by the Far Eastern Commission. At this time, our country can use its diplomacy properly, and the country's views will surely be adopted by the Far Eastern Commission.

Third, we that the Far Eastern Commission's decision is the general preliminary plan for Japan announced by the United States in October 1945, and Japan should have the obligation to pay compensation and return looted goods. In April 1946, Pauley, the compensation commissioner representing the US President, suggested reducing Japan's peacetime industrial capacity by 30%, with the aim of preventing Japan from launching another war and making the Japanese people understand that they are the defeated country and should be punished. The Pauley Plan was passed by the Far Eastern Commission in May 1946, and the United States also expressed its agreement. For a year, the Far Eastern Commission has been trying to implement this plan, and has designated 1,100 factories to be dismantled for compensation in countries such as China and the Philippines. On June 20, 1947, the Far Eastern Commission announced the basic policies for Japan, which are regarded as the basis and principles for the future conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty, and further defined clear concepts for Japanese industrial levels and compensation. Our China is one of the important member states of the Far Eastern Commission, and should respect the organization and resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission. The content of the Pauley Plan is indeed too "strict" in the eyes of the US military, but according to our research, it does have a suspicion of being "big". In order to respect the spirit of the Far Eastern Commission's resolution, we did not reject the passage of the Pauley Plan. The US Department of the Army's confidence in the Pauley Plan has obviously wavered. 'Strike Report' not only wants to reject the Pauley Plan, but also wants to change the original view, cancel all resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, and even abandon the punitive position determined by the Potsdam Agreement, and adopt a positive position to support Japan's revival, regardless of the future peace treaty with Japan. In any case, we cannot agree

In short, the anti-compensation theory of the "Strike Report" and the attempt to oppose all resolutions passed by the Far Eastern Commission are completely unreasonable. We hope that the wise American government authorities can consider the explosiveness of the "Strike anti-compensation theory", make a decisive decision, and immediately maintain the original view. At the same time, we also hope that the American authorities will quickly break the deadlock in the Japanese peace conference so that the Japanese compensation issue and the industrial level issue can be resolved rationally as soon as possible!

### East Xinjiang People's Representatives Visit Chairman, Present Flag, and Pay Respects

[Our reporter in Nanjing on the 5th] The East Xinjiang People's Representative Group, including Dr. Yao Le and ten others, went to the National Government to visit Chairman Jiang to pay their respects and present a flag at 11 a.m. on the 5th. The Chairman received them and inquired in detail about the political and economic situation and the situation of various ethnic groups in East Xinjiang. The representatives then presented a flag embroidered with the four characters "Leader of China". A photo was taken as a souvenir before they left. The group also presented a flag to Madame Chiang Kai-shek with the words "Light of Women," which was entrusted to the Chairman's staff for delivery.

### Zhang Zuoxiang and Others' Written Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Zhang Zuoxiang, Ma Zhanshan, Wan Fulin, and others issued a written statement before leaving Beijing for Shanghai. The original text is as follows. When Liaoyang fell, Anshan was besieged, and Shenyang was in danger, Zuoxiang and others were urgently summoned by the central government. Since arriving in Beijing via Shanghai, compatriots in Beijing and Shanghai and public opinion circles have unanimously believed that the Northeast is important, that without the Northeast there is no North China, and without North China there is no country. The safety and survival of the country depend on ensuring the Northeast as the key. Not only has the past mistaken understanding of "the Northeast is the Northeast of the Northeasterners" been eliminated, but the goal has been concentrated, and everyone has risen up to appeal, which has indeed added to our infinite inspiration and belief.

During the eleven days in Beijing, we successively visited military and political leaders such as Chief of Staff Chen, President Zhang, and Minister Bai, as well as people from all walks of life. We also had a discussion with Ambassador Stuart, and we have presented our opinions on saving the Northeast crisis separately, which has been highly valued. Recently, we visited Chairman Jiang, who personally instructed that "the government is determined to ensure the Northeast, and will immediately send a large army to reinforce it, reverse the battle situation, and the established policy towards the Northeast will be thoroughly implemented to the end. The central government has the determination, methods, and confidence to protect the Northeast." After listening to this, we deeply admire and appreciate the head of state's long-term vision and decision-making. We believe that bringing this news and impression back to the Northeast and conveying it to the military and civilians who are suffering will surely further encourage their emotions in support of the central government and inspire their spirit of fighting for the country, thereby expanding the results of their bandit suppression. Since Zuoxiang and others came at the call of the government, and now that we have fulfilled our task of being interviewed, we should return north. On the occasion of parting, we would like to say to our compatriots and government officials in Beijing and Shanghai that although the current political and military situation is slightly serious, with the existing vast human, financial, and material resources, if they can be properly organized and used, under the wise leadership of the Chairman, we will surely achieve the final victory in suppressing the rebellion and building the country. In order to win, it is important to win over the hearts of the people, boost morale, strengthen the organization and training of the people, reuse officers in the countryside, develop local armed forces, cooperate with the national army in combat, and fully exert the political and popular strength that has been neglected in the past. Zuoxiang and others are getting old and have no other desires than to save the country and their hometown. We hope that our sincere intentions will be understood. As for the emergency measures to save the Northeast, and all the issues in the implementation of political, economic, and other important reforms in the future, we believe that the representatives of the Northeast Petition Group can continue to petition the government based on the wishes of the Northeast compatriots and the guidance and encouragement of the people of Beijing and Shanghai, and will surely achieve the two major goals of stabilizing the Northeast and consolidating North China, and achieve satisfactory results.

### Northeast Groups in Beijing Welcome Zhang Zuoxiang and Others

Two Proposals Passed on the Spot

[Our reporter in Nanjing on the 5th] Northeast elders and the Northeast Petition Group were invited by relevant Northeast groups in Beijing to attend a welcome meeting at 2 p.m. on the 5th. The meeting was presided over by Lu Zhonglin, who emphasized that our solution to the Northeast problem cannot be achieved by shouting slogans. The Northeast is not a question of whether it can be lost or not, but a question of whether it can be lost. What we should discuss today is how to prevent it from being lost. Then Zhang Zuoxiang delivered a speech, saying that he came to Beijing at the invitation of Chief of Staff Chen to prepare for inquiries, and at the same time visited Chairman Jiang to report on the Northeast issue. He believed that the main reason for the failure to make full use of human and material resources was that there should be corrections in the future. Then Wang Huaichi delivered a speech. Wang first explained the significance of this visit in two points: (1) To show that the people of the Northeast and the people of North China are sincerely supporting the central government; (2) The representatives who came to Beijing this time came from various places, both old and young, but their wishes are the same. If the central government is prepared to recover the Northeast, they will do their best and vow to be the backing. Secondly, Wang reviewed the situation in the Northeast in several points: (1) In terms of military affairs, it is undeniable that it has already failed. The number of communist bandits is increasing, which is caused by our strategic mistakes, and we only know how to defend certain strongholds to the death, so that after the strongholds fall, the troops are also lost; (2) In the past, we did not know how to use local armed forces, and we only knew how to use soldiers but did not know how to use the people, which led to the current mistakes; (3) Discord in personnel, disharmony between officers and soldiers, which led to the current situation; (4) The issue of currency in circulation needs to be resolved, because this matter is related to the overall situation and needs to be resolved urgently. Then two proposals were passed: (1) In order to support the government in completing the great plan to suppress the rebellion, this meeting will call on compatriots in the 29 provinces, cities, and districts of the North to support the petition of the Northeast representatives and the eight urgent appeals of the Northeast Beijing Fellow Villagers Association on the 29th of last month, and jointly urge the government to accept them all, implement them immediately, and vow to be the backing of the government and the Northeast in order to rescue the Northeast and stabilize North China. (2) Please ask the conference to send a telegram to the US President and the Senate and House of Representatives to speed up military aid to China.

Beijing Municipal Council Tea Party Reception

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Municipal Council held a tea party to entertain the elders from the Northeast and the people's representatives from the nine provinces and three cities who came to Beijing. It was held at the Gongyu Lianhuan Society at 10 a.m. on the 5th. Speaker Chen Yuguang presided over the meeting and delivered a welcome speech, emphasizing that the Northeast people's representatives came to Beijing to petition not only for the Northeast, but also for the whole country. The Northeast issue is one of the issues of the whole of China and even the whole world. If the Northeast issue is resolved, the issues of the whole country and the whole world can be resolved at the same time.

### Wedemeyer Praises President Chiang Expresses Opinions on Aid to China in the House Foreign Affairs Committee

[US News Service, Washington, 4th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, who served as the commander of US forces in China during the war, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 4th that he recommended that military assistance be included in the $570 million economic aid plan for China. Wedemeyer specifically stated that the so-called military assistance did not mean military participation in resisting the Communist Chinese army. He proposed that appropriate technical guidance be given on the use of the supplied weapons.

Wedemeyer believes that in national policy, he holds sincere disagreements with Marshall's opinion. However, he expressed the highest respect for the Secretary of State's loyalty, [space] and ability. He stated, "Unless we protect the assistance we provide, I believe we should help other countries in cultural, economic and political warfare."

When answering a question, Wedemeyer stated, "I believe we should provide military assistance to all nations in the world who believe in our way of life and are willing to remain free. I believe we should provide military assistance to China."

Someone asked if it would be more appropriate to expand economic assistance at present, and then expand military assistance when China has obtained opportunities for self-help and when necessary? Wedemeyer replied, "If it were two years ago, I would think your proposal was perfect, but today I think it is too late."

General Wedemeyer stated that the Communist Party army poured into the Northeast and [space] National Headquarters from the north at such a rate and strength that "mere money" could not stop it in that area or any area. He also criticized the erroneous view that [space] the Chinese Communist Party is merely a peasant who wants to escape the oppression of the autocratic [space] government. He is convinced that the Chinese Communist Party is working for international communism [space].

Wedemeyer explained to the Foreign Affairs Committee that due to the confidential nature of the reports he [space] submitted to the General Staff regarding the situation in China and Korea, he felt [space] it was somewhat difficult to testify. He said that for security reasons, he also had to be careful when answering [space] questions, because he was the Director of the War Planning Department and might have confidential information on these issues.

When asked whether he thought the threat to the United States was greater from China [space] or from Europe, Wedemeyer asked the committee to forgive him for being unable to answer [space], because people in other fields would be interested in the answer to this question. The Foreign Affairs Committee agreed to Wedemeyer's request and decided to hold an executive session so that Wedemeyer could give a more complete answer. However, in the segment where he was granted temporary non-response, Wedemeyer praised President Chiang's personality and the progress made by the Chinese government in terms of reform.

Wedemeyer praised President Chiang: "I know President Chiang very well. Dunnan (former political advisor to the President) may know him even [space] better, but Dunnan is dead. I have been with the President for two years, and I have the highest respect and admiration for him. He is an absolutely honest and upright man."

Wedemeyer denied that during the last war, large amounts of American military supplies had been diverted by corrupt leaders of the Nationalist government for other purposes. He said that when he was patrolling in China, almost all of the American supplies that flew over India reached [space] the hands of the Nationalist army.

One committee member asked whether he trusted China's promises, [space] [space] [space] said that he knew President Chiang's absolute integrity and [space] truth, and that in his past dealings with the President, he had never encountered "Oriental [space] opportunity."

He [space] believed that the Chinese could fulfill all their agreements. He also said that the Chinese government is now trying to move forward in the direction that the United States wants and [space] to establish new joint administrations.

Wedemeyer continued: "Foreigners who have lived in China for a long time have told me that they are amazed at the progress that President Chiang has made." However, Wedemeyer expressed doubts about whether the Chinese government could defeat the Communist Party. When asked what kind of action would be needed to help China defeat the Communist Party, Wedemeyer hesitated for a moment, and then replied that he could not provide a "listening-sensitive answer," saying that this matter should be guided by the State Department.

He explained: "Since my last visit to China, the Chinese situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I cannot answer at this moment. A new investigation must be conducted to determine how much assistance is needed."

[United Press, Washington, 4th] When Wedemeyer expressed his views on the Aid to China Act in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he praised President Chiang, saying: "When I took office as the Commander of the US Military Region in China, I did not intend to trust President Chiang, but [space] when I was in office, I admired him very much; Mr. Chiang cares about the people and is not arrogant, and is willing to sacrifice himself. Japan once seemed to be on the verge of defeating China. I asked President Chiang to [space] organize new troops [space] troops, and the Chiang army accepted without hesitation, and the situation [space] was saved." Republican Congressman Chow Yide also told Wedemeyer: "As far as I know, Marshall did not oppose military aid to China, but only did not want to include this aid in the bill currently being discussed by Congress." After Wedemeyer finished his speech, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a closed-door meeting. (Note: The main points of Wedemeyer's testimony have been seen in yesterday's first edition.)

### The Five-Nation Conference in The Hague Plans to Draft a Fifty-Year Mutual Defense Treaty A General Agreement is Expected to be Reached Tomorrow

[This newspaper's report] London, 5th, broadcast: Brussels report, the five-nation conference discussing the Western European Union was temporarily adjourned today because Britain's second representative, Jeb, and the French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General, Zhuo Faner, were delayed by heavy fog in the North Sea after returning to their countries for instructions, preventing them from arriving on time. It is expected that the conference will reach a general understanding on Sunday.

[Central News Agency, Brussels, 4th, Associated Press] Representatives from five countries, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, have begun meeting in an urgent atmosphere to draft a long-term economic, cultural, and military treaty. This meeting is expected to lay the foundation for the rapid establishment of the Western European Union by democratic countries and to pave the way for future meetings of the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan. This extremely secret meeting is being held outside the Belgian capital, and journalists are not allowed to enter the venue. However, after the 90-minute meeting, a communiqué was issued stating that the five countries had extremely similar opinions. British and Belgian sources said that the proposed treaty would include military clauses stipulating that unified action would be taken against acts of aggression from any direction. The treaty would last for 50 years and is officially referred to as an economic, social, and cultural treaty. The British Foreign Minister said that this treaty is the foundation for establishing a solid and much-needed organization. It is also learned that the military clauses will include a guarantee of military assistance if Western Europe is attacked. There is no indication that the governments have formally exchanged documents. Well-informed sources said that the exchange could only take place after the Western European Union had been formally established.

[Reuters, Brussels, 4th] People close to the five-nation delegation said that the Western European Union Convention is expected to be drafted quickly. The preliminary talks of the five powers that began in Brussels on the 4th could end by this Saturday or at the latest by Sunday. The foreign ministers of the five countries could meet before the meeting of the sixteen European countries discussing the Marshall Plan in Paris on March 15 to conclude the drafting of the Western European Union Convention and complete the signing procedures. According to reliable sources, the preliminary meeting in Brussels does not intend to discuss the military issues of the Western European Union's Five-Nation Convention. This point will be discussed after British Imperial Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery visits Belgium at the end of this month to inspect Belgian military equipment. It is also learned that the British and French representatives will present new proposals for the Western European Union, which were recently produced after an exchange of views between Britain and France, for the study of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg at the meeting on the 5th. The draft convention proposed by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg is said to have obtained a general agreement from the representatives. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg advocate the conclusion of a close regional agreement between the five countries. Although the United Nations Charter already has provisions for regional agreements, this five-nation convention should include provisions for mutual assistance and the peaceful resolution of any possible disagreements between the signatory countries."

### The United States Supports the Western European Union May Provide a Guarantee of Military Assistance

[Reuters, London, 4th] Observers here believe that the early signing of the Western European Five-Nation Convention can prove that Washington has already expressed its readiness to support the Western European Union with the necessary military backing. Most people believe that the United States and Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have reached an understanding on the security aspects of the Western European Union. Judging from the statement made by US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett yesterday, this speculation can be proven to be correct.

Lovett said that a guarantee from the United States against aggression against the countries of the Marshall Plan could replace the forty-year anti-German aggression convention previously proposed by the United States. Although Lovett also stated that the United States' guarantee would not be realized until some form of Western European Union already existed, there is no doubt that the United States will encourage the early establishment of this alliance. It has recently been learned that among the sixteen Western European countries, in addition to Britain and France, at least Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, and three Nordic countries will send their foreign ministers to Paris to discuss the possibility of expanding the Western European Union with Britain and France. Britain's participation in the military responsibilities of the Western European Union is also of direct interest to other countries of the British Commonwealth. It is expected here that if Britain accepts military obligations under the Western European Union, other countries of the British Commonwealth may only be willing to establish appropriate military ties with the Western European Union, rather than directly accepting formal military obligations.

### The Dunkirk Treaty One Year Anniversary

British and French Foreign Ministers Exchange Letters and Telegrams

### Bulgaria Celebrates Independence

Everything Shows Hatred for Turkey and Pro-Soviet Sentiment

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 4th] Relations between Turkey and the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe have deteriorated. Bulgaria, under the control of the Communist Party, celebrated the "70th Anniversary of Liberation from Turkish Shackles" yesterday. Most of the speeches and newspaper headlines denounced Turkey, and the articles contained pro-Soviet sentiment. After several years of war between Russia, Turkey, and Bulgaria, the Treaty of Berlin was concluded yesterday in 1878, and Bulgaria was transformed from a province of Turkey into an independent country. In addition, the Czech ambassador to Turkey, the embassy counselor, and the first secretary were summoned back to their country. They have now decided to refuse to return to Prague and are selling their personal belongings in preparation for going to the United States.

### Italian Foreign Minister Clarifies National Policy

[French News Agency, Rome, 4th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza delivered a report to the cabinet this morning on Italy's national policy, stating that Italy has a major responsibility in promoting European economic cooperation. It is an honor for Italy to be a part of the European Recovery Program, because only this program is the key to revitalizing a peaceful and democratic Europe. However, other issues that we encounter are also very important. These issues are of great importance to defending peace and reorganizing Europe, such as the African issue. The issues that the peace treaty can solve include the basic issues of Germany, etc.

### The Czech President is Ill Doctors Instructed to Rest

Anti-Communist Elements Flee

[Reuters, Prague, 5th] A Czech intelligence official announced: President Beneš [space] is ill, and doctors have ordered him to rest completely, so he cannot return to Prague from his country residence. According to the current Czech constitution, when the president is unable to perform his duties, he is replaced by the prime minister.

[Reuters, Prague, 4th] According to unofficial information, there may be thousands of Czech anti-communists who have fled the country for fear of being reported.

### Finnish Political Parties Express Positions: Oppose Alliance with Soviet Union, But Support Negotiating Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance

[Associated Press, Helsinki, 5th] The Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, two minority parties, announced today their opposition to a military alliance with the Soviet Union, but jointly with other parties, they support beginning negotiations with the Soviet Union to sign a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance. The Communist People's Front advocates immediately signing an alliance with the Soviet Union. The final decision rests with President Paasikivi.

### Stalin's Letter: Translation Error

[Central News Agency, Helsinki, 4th] According to observers here, after correcting an error in the translation of Stalin's letter, Finland can avoid concluding a military agreement with the Soviet Union. The error was discovered in the translation of a private letter from Stalin to President Paasikivi. The corrected translation revealed that the Soviet Union did not request Finland to sign an agreement similar to that of Hungary and Romania. This revised translation provides Finland with an opportunity to negotiate only a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, without military mutual assistance clauses.

### Soviet Union Protests to the United States Again: Infringement of Far East Commercial Navigation

Initial Protest Unanswered

[Reuters, Moscow, Date Not Given] The Soviet Foreign Ministry has sent a second note to the US government protesting against infringements on the freedom of commercial navigation in the Pacific Ocean and demanding immediate measures to stop such infringements. According to an English broadcast on Moscow Radio: US aircraft continue to infringe on the freedom of commercial navigation. The Soviet Foreign Minister previously sent a note to the US Embassy in the Soviet Union on January 30th, protesting the repeated infringements by US aircraft on the freedom of commercial navigation, reconnaissance of Soviet merchant ships in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan, circling low over their ships, and even diving down. The Soviet Department hopes that the US government will instruct its appropriate US authorities to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future. However, to date, the United States has not provided a response, and at the same time, the Soviet government has learned that US aircraft continue to infringe on the freedom of navigation of merchant ships in the Far East. Therefore, the Soviet Department has issued another note to the US Embassy, urging the US government to pay attention to this matter and demanding immediate measures to stop it.

### Ashida Invites Katayama to Join Cabinet Three Times; Socialist Party Refuses Again; Japan's Cabinet Formation Encounters Difficulties Again

[New Asia, Tokyo, 5th] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida visited Socialist Party Chairman Katayama on the morning of the 5th and earnestly requested him to join the cabinet three times. However, Katayama still replied that he had no intention of joining the cabinet, but could consult with the central organs of the Socialist Party before making a decision. At 4:00 PM, the Socialist Party Central Executive Committee held a meeting, at which Katayama first reported on Prime Minister Ashida's three requests for him to join the cabinet. At the time, except for one committee member who said, "Since the party has supported the Ashida cabinet, it is natural for the party leader to join the cabinet," all other committee members expressed opposition. As a result, it was decided that Katayama would not join the cabinet.

After the meeting, Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma visited Takeda at the cabinet formation headquarters to convey the Socialist Party's decision and hoped that the Ashida cabinet's formation work could proceed, treating the Katayama issue separately. Takeda replied that he would respond early on the 6th. As a result, the Ashida cabinet wasted another day because of Katayama's cabinet participation issue, and cabinet formation work will be difficult to complete this week. Furthermore, Socialist Party Chairman Katayama issued a statement after meeting with Democratic Party President Ashida on the 5th, saying, "Although President Ashida has repeatedly requested me to join the cabinet, I believe that it is better to unite the party and cooperate with the new cabinet. I have fully considered the country's problems and believe that it is extremely important to strengthen the party, which is the foundation of progressive policies. Therefore, I have declined to join the cabinet so far. As for whether the cabinet will collapse because I do not join, I do not know. I believe that the responsibility for forming a cabinet lies with the person who is appointed, not with the Socialist Party." Prime Minister Ashida also issued a statement after meeting with Katayama, saying, "The Ashida cabinet's first condition is Katayama's participation. If this cannot be decided, then I am determined not to convene a meeting of the three party leaders or to deliberate on cabinet appointments. I plan to continue to earnestly request him to join the cabinet." Furthermore, Prime Minister Ashida conferred with Kurisu and Takeda at the Foreign Minister's residence on the afternoon of the 5th, and then rushed from Tokyo to Yokohama at 5:30 PM to attend a banquet for the commander of the US Eighth Army.

The wording used in the defense brief was extremely offensive to China, and all Chinese observers were extremely indignant. This afternoon, the military tribunal ordered the defense counsel to stop their statements and ordered them to revise the document containing pre-war Japanese anti-China propaganda. Only when the "offensive words" are removed from the document will the defense's statements regarding the China stage be allowed to continue.

### The Memoirs of Cordell Hull (I) (4): Copyright by the North American Newspaper Alliance

— Translated by Our Editorial Department

Praying for Lasting Peace to Descend Upon Mankind

In my seventy-five years of life, I have seen this country grow from a continental power to a world power, with interests in every corner of the globe.

We are powerful today in terms of military strength, and also in terms of peace and humanitarianism. But with our vast power comes a great responsibility. The greatest of these responsibilities is to lead the nations on the path of cooperation for peace, justice, freedom, and progress.

In the past, there was a common view, supported by tradition, that the United States had nothing to fear and that its future was assured. Our vast resources and organizational abilities guaranteed our destiny, and our system would endure forever. There is no belief more dangerous than this.

In fact, we have reached a time when we should stand still, watch, and listen. We should analyze ourselves and our place in the world with sharp introspection.

Are the people of this generation truly better off than their predecessors in previous generations? Science and invention have given them more things to enjoy; in this respect, they are indeed much better off than people in the past. They have all kinds of good things to eat and good things to wear, and good entertainment. Compared with the limited life enjoyment of the past, they are indeed much happier. But in some other respects, the situation is worse. They lack extensive education, lack enthusiasm for freedom and the rule of law, and fail to maintain a keen interest and vigilance in the conduct of public affairs.

In my opinion, organized society has declined in the past generation.

We have seen a marked decline in the entire international political organization, and the entire international economic organization is threatened with destruction. In political and economic affairs, mankind has suffered a gradual decline. It is useless for us to sing the praises of scientific and technological progress to hypnotize everyone. Unless the citizens of our country and the citizens of other countries are as concerned and attentive to public affairs as they are to their private affairs, we will inevitably fail completely in dealing with our domestic affairs and the problem of world peace. And the problem of world peace will become even more serious due to the invention of the atomic bomb.

Democracy is not a static institution, like a church or a skyscraper. Once democracy is established, it cannot be expected to stand independently generation after generation. Democracy is a living organism, so it must be cared for, cultivated, and guided.

We cannot be satisfied with past achievements and present wealth. All the freedoms we have today have been obtained by resisting tyranny at home or abroad, and most of them have been bought with blood and iron.

Freedom comes through the efforts of those men and women who are willing to give their lives for it. We are their heirs, so we must be careful to preserve our heritage.

Let us choose as our leaders those who truly understand the needs of the people. Some of our leaders, like Jefferson, entered public service to promote democracy and benefit the people. Jefferson had no intention of seeking power, let alone status or favors. He even tried to get Madison to replace him as a candidate for president. Of course, we also have people with the same noble spirit today. We urgently need more religion and morality as the background of government. Here, as everywhere in the world, there is a need to strengthen the religious and moral foundations of thought and action. There is no greater force for civilization than religious and moral ideas. Only when these ideas give people the ability to recognize corruption and tyranny and give them the power to eliminate them can such corruption and tyranny be driven out of government.

The states of the United States should always be mindful of protecting the civil rights of their citizens. The right of all citizens to vote freely should be protected, and their path to the ballot box should not be obstructed.

I believe that Congress and the Executive Branch must observe strict economic thrift in government, and the states, counties, and cities must do the same. In this modern world, most officials and individuals often pay little attention to public or private finances.

Let us adhere to the old policy of individual creativity and free enterprise as much as circumstances permit. The government must play an important role in supervising and inspecting, ensuring the true freedom and fairness of free enterprise, and protecting all the people. But the government must not kill the spirit that has made our nation great. Congress and the Executive Branch have an unavoidable responsibility to keep our foreign policy on a non-partisan basis. During my time in the State Department, I never worked so hard on any issue as I did on this one.

I continue to believe that the requirement in the Senate that the approval of all treaties requires a two-thirds vote should be changed by a constitutional amendment to require only a majority vote for passage. The people, Congress, and Executive Branch of the United States must pay close attention to avoid the United States returning to a dangerous policy of isolationism. The two world wars within a generation should make all Americans realize that we are an important part of the world, that conflicts overseas will inevitably affect us, and that our welfare, peace, and security are linked to those of other countries. We have an unavoidable responsibility to lead and cooperate.

In the past, until 1934, perhaps the most obvious dereliction of duty to the world was our economic isolationism. High tariffs did not bring us prosperity. They brought us unsold surplus goods at home and resentment from other countries overseas.

President Washington spoke out against forming permanent alliances with other countries, although he acquiesced to temporary alliances. But the nature of the United Nations now is an anti-aggression alliance. We should not be shocked by this kind of alliance. It is not an alliance against other groups of countries, but an alliance against any aggression. It is not an alliance for war, but an alliance for peace.

The United Nations organization includes all peace-loving nations, and its establishment, in my opinion, is a turning point in the development of world politics.

But let us not think that the United Nations can perform a miracle. The Charter of the United Nations is a man-made instrument, not a perfect one. For this organization to work effectively, it requires time, patience, and a spirit of cooperation from all countries.

Especially important is the continued cooperation of the five major powers: the Soviet Union, Britain, China, France, and the United States. Only the common friendly cooperation between these five countries can generate the understanding and concerted action necessary to maintain peace.

The United Nations should have and must have the unwavering support of the American people. We should not be discouraged by the conflicting opinions expressed in the various councils of this new organization. We should not believe on the one hand that the United Nations cannot work, so we must restore nationalism and isolationism, and on the other hand that the United Nations is inadequate, so we must replace it with a world government.

We should strive to promote a plan for universal disarmament, with the United Nations implementing supervision in various countries to ensure the execution of this plan. The insane competition of economic and military armament is an accusation against civilization. Those advocating increased armament are playing with the lives and property of tens of millions of men, women, and childre. But disarmament must be comparative, and we must never again allow the United States to decline to a point of military helplessness. When we explain our foreign policy, other countries must still be able to see signs of our strength. Americans must exercise restraint in expressing opinions about other countries. Our nation is accustomed to criticizing other countries and rulers, using adjectives, satire, and ridicule lightly. We forget that these harsh words are not buried in the news columns of newspapers or lost in forums or radio broadcasts. These words are known to the governments and people being cursed, and they will be reprinted and criticized by the newspapers and radios of those countries, because these countries may not understand our freedom of criticism, and these words hinder our diplomatic relations. Before scolding others, one should count from one to ten. To this old rule, I would add a new rule: before scolding another country, we should count for ten hours or ten days, and at the same time, we should ascertain the full truth of the events that seem worthy of condemnation.

I would like to ask American minority groups to pay special attention to this rule, whether these groups belong to racial, national, or religious categories. The purpose of the Constitution is to protect all people, especially minorities. But in recent years, some of these groups have used the progress of reporting and propaganda methods to put forward a voice and pressure on foreign affairs that are disproportionate to their numbers. Most of these minority groups that interfere in foreign affairs are left-wing or reactionary extremists. There are also some people who have recently immigrated to the United States, who are chronic agitators, and their opinions are sufficient to disrupt our political and economic organization. There have been many times when these groups, supported by a uniformly aggressive public opinion, spread poison or otherwise disrupted international relations when our government's international relations required the most delicate and careful handling.

We must recognize and willingly assume our obligations to our former enemies, Germany and Japan. If we must maintain military or other supervision over them for the next few decades, then we should willingly maintain this supervision. We should not harbor the idea of ​​withdrawing rapidly from Europe or Asia.

In the Western Hemisphere, let us continue to develop and expand the Good Neighbor Policy in every possible way. The results we have obtained from this policy prove that we should further cultivate this seed. In our times of trouble, our friends to the south, with only one exception, have proven to be our true friends.

Our country and all countries, especially including the major allied powers that fought to the death against the forces of tyranny last time, are simply deceiving themselves if they do not understand that they will face the greatest crisis in history in the near future. If they are determined to ensure that the forces of peace, order, and civilization continue to progress along with the task of unifying and consolidating their political and moral strength, then they will have great success to maintain the world's lasting peace, freedom, and civilization, and if necessary, to maintain it by force.

All countries must constantly strive to cooperate together on a basis of absolute equality, on the one hand without prejudice, and on the other hand without favoritism or appeasement.

Of the many basic principles of international cooperation, each is extremely important, but the supreme duty that all countries and peoples absolutely cannot escape is to maintain and develop an international organization capable of permanently maintaining peace. Here is a near-axiom: countries that faithfully fulfill the duties of membership in the United Nations organization will receive equal and incalculable benefits, and countries that do not fulfill these duties will encounter increasing difficulties. For the benefit of all, all countries should work together to ensure that this world organization continues permanently and becomes a truly effective organization. Our great country should always facilitate the autonomy and independence of the dependent nations, according to the precedent we have set in the Philippines, when they are ready. But our policy in this regard cannot be limited to sponsorship, but must also include active economic assistance to raise the living standards of these nations.

We must also advocate the free expression of public opinion in the world. Today, there are no free newspapers or radios in the world. Probably half of the countries suppress or filter reports, or color them. We cannot hope to obtain a true understanding that will prevent war until the minds of the nations can communicate with each other completely freely.

I end these memoirs with the following belief: that the destiny of our country is still ahead of us, not behind us. If we are willing to stop at any time to review the past, assess the present, and prepare for the future, then I believe that the horizon of success is still extending before us, like an endless plain. And the most sublime success is to cooperate in harmony with other countries until the whip of war is taken from our backs and a lasting and friendly peace descends upon us.

[Our Report] The Municipal Assembly continued its ninth meeting yesterday afternoon, making important resolutions regarding the levying of the Hardoon Garden and the demolition of houses on Tianmu Road. The proposal to levy the Hardoon Garden for a park has been rejected. The demolition of houses on Tianmu Road will be implemented after a committee is first organized to properly plan for the aftermath.

The details of the proposals discussed at the Assembly are recorded below: Regarding the Hardoon Garden issue, there are three related proposals: (1) A letter from David George Hardoon forwarded by the Mayor, stating that he personally owns more than 50 mu of land in the Hardoon Garden and is willing to donate 15 mu, and intends to allocate three-tenths of the proceeds from the sale of the charity foundation's real estate to build a library to present to the government. However, this suggestion was not accepted by the Assembly, resulting in the complete freezing of the Hardoon estate to this day, and affecting the charity's plans. Therefore, it is hoped that the Municipal Assembly will reconsider and pass the proposal for donation to respect property rights and benefit the public. (2) A proposal by Zhang Zhongyuan and others requesting "the prompt implementation of building an art museum using the donated land." (3) A motion by Zhang Naizuo at the fourth general meeting to "implement the spirit of the first and third general meetings of this assembly, resolving to requisition the Aiwen Garden on Nanjing West Road and convert it into a park, changing it to requisitioning the garden as a permanent park for the city to benefit citizens and emphasize public health." This case was resolved as "reserved" at the last general meeting. Therefore, it must be resolved first at this general meeting.

Mayor Explains: Two Options

According to Mayor Wu's explanation: The government can only take two measures regarding the Hardoon Garden: (1) Accept the donation, (2) Completely requisition it. If a decision is made to requisition, it is also possible, but according to the land law, the government must raise sufficient funds within three years, otherwise, the government's credibility will be lost. As for the donation, George Hardoon is donating 15 mu of land under his name, but other heirs are unwilling to donate. George Hardoon is also willing to contribute three-tenths of the proceeds from the sale of the charity foundation's real estate for the construction of a library, which was estimated at about 500,000 US dollars at the time. Now, the Municipal Government, because he is unwilling to increase the land donation, is asking to increase the funding, raising the three-tenths to four-tenths, to which George Hardoon has expressed that he can consider. According to my personal opinion, in addition to accepting his land donation and donation for the construction of a library, it is proposed to requisition another 15 mu of land from the Hardoon Garden to build an art museum.

Huge Expenses: Opposition to Requisition

Following the discussion of the requisition issue, the senators who spoke all expressed opposition to requisition. Jiang Pingfan's reasons for not advocating requisition are: the issue of funding. The land price of the Hardoon Garden cannot be estimated at present. If based on the auction of housing foundations, according to the estimate of 35 years, the land price in the area should be 18 million yuan per mu, but the owner does not agree. After repeated negotiations with the mayor, it was set at 1.2 billion yuan per mu, which is 66 times higher than two years ago, and the land price of the Hardoon Garden should be worth at least 5 billion yuan per mu, which would require 750 billion one yuan for 150 mu.

The government has an empty treasury and has not yet been able to repay the land price for land that has already been requisitioned, let alone for those that have not been requisitioned? Even if there is such a large sum of money, it should be used to solve problems such as people's livelihood or housing shortages, and should not be used to open parks. As for the donation issue, since this matter is beneficial to the citizens and does not burden the country, there is no need to submit it to the Assembly for discussion, and it can be sent back to the mayor for a decision, whether to build a library or an art museum or a Tongzhi Museum, all of which will be handled by the Municipal Government.

Legal and Factual Difficulties

Zhao Yangxiong also stated that requisitioning is difficult in reality. However, Zhang Zhihan believes that the land price of the Hardoon Garden has not yet been estimated, so how can there be a value of 750 billion yuan? If so, why did the previous general meeting not consider this point and insist on passing it? The Executive Yuan has approved the requisition, so there is no need to worry, and the government can requisition it. After he finished speaking, the Speaker immediately stated that the previous general meeting did not pass the requisition. The requisition proposal was only proposed at the fourth general meeting, and the resolution was "reserved." Please pay attention to Senator Zhang. Fei Shusheng, Yue, and Jiang Huaisu also said that requisitioning is difficult in law and in fact, and they do not agree to requisitioning.

Final Vote: Not a Single Endorsement

Chen Cunren also reported that the scenery in the Hardoon Garden is not as imagined by the outside world, and it may not be possible to open a park as soon as the door is opened. About 30 mu of the internal burned land, rockery collapsed, and trees were cut down, and it would cost a lot to build a park. Jiang Hao agrees with the mayor's opinion to accept the donation on the one hand and requisition 15 mu on the other. However, after the Speaker indicated that the Municipal Government intends to requisition separately, it can only be handled according to the law. The plan should be drawn up and submitted to the Assembly for discussion separately, which is not within the scope of this case. Therefore, in the final vote, not a single vote was in favor of requisition (Zhang Zhihan also expressed opposition), and Zhang Naizuo's proposal was rejected.

As for the donation issue, the Assembly resolved to adopt Jiang Pingfan's opinion and return it to the Municipal Government for full handling. The construction of art museums, Tongzhi museums, or libraries will all be planned and managed by the Municipal Government.

### The Assembly Passed with Enthusiastic Endorsement: The Chairman is the First President; Resolved to Telegraph the United States to Implement Full Aid to China; Separately Commended the Troops that Contributed to the Elimination of Accumulated Bandits

[Our Report] The motion by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Assembly the day before yesterday to "request the Assembly to unanimously endorse Chairman Chiang of the National Government as the first President" was proposed by the Speaker at yesterday's general meeting, and all the senators in the hall unanimously passed it with enthusiastic applause. Speaker Pan also expressed the hope that the National Assembly representatives elected by regional, professional, and women's groups in this city can abide by the resolution of the public opinion organs of this city and unanimously elect Chairman Chiang as the President at the National Assembly.

In addition, two temporary motions were passed: (1) The motion by Speaker Pan and others "to eliminate accumulated bandits and eliminate chaos by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and to request the Assembly to resolve to commend the department and the troops participating in this battle," The Assembly resolved that this case was passed, and at the same time telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to convey condolences to the soldiers at the front. (2) The motion by the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and others to send a telegram to the American government and public in the name of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly to immediately implement full aid to China was also passed by the Assembly.

### Tianmu Road House Demolition Case: First Plan for the Aftermath and Establish Measures

Regarding the case of demolishing houses on Tianmu Road to widen the road, although it was resolved by the Provisional Assembly earlier, the residents repeatedly made requests, and the Assembly discussed it several times without completion. This time, Pan Jiemei and others proposed "to overturn the decision of the former Provisional Assembly to demolish houses and build roads on Tianmu Road during the period of turmoil in order to relieve the suffering and respect public opinion." However, after the Speaker explained that the rules of procedure of this meeting did not mention the review of a item, it was suggested whether the reasons for the case could be changed slightly. As a result, the reasons for the case were passed as "to temporarily suspend the demolition of Tianmu Road houses during the turmoil period."

Mayor and Bureau Chief Express Opinions

Before the resolution was made, Gua Kang, Chief of the Bureau of Public Works, said that Tianmu Road is a transportational keystone in Zhabei and has a great relationship with urban planning. Widening it will greatly help north-south traffic, so from a technical point of view, widening is necessary. However, he could not express an opinion on the stability of the residents, but he believes that stability and construction cannot be separated.

Mayor Wu said that it is indeed difficult to demolish houses during the period of suppression of the rebellion. However, the construction of the city is a problem for the entire Shanghai. If the Tianmu Road case cannot be implemented, the progress of the city in the future will be restricted. Therefore, the review opinions of the Baocheng Works Committee. After discussion, the Assembly immediately revised it based on the review opinions and made it a resolution: "This case is deeply sympathetic to the residents' complaints of distress, but it has been resolved by the Provisional Assembly and the Assembly for several times, and it has been approved by the Executive Yuan. In order to take into account the current situation, it is proposed that the Municipal Government, together with representatives of the residents, representatives of the district public office and district people's congress, jointly organize a committee to properly plan the aftercare and implement it immediately. However, those who are willing to voluntarily demolish are not subject to this rule.

Houses Protruding on Fuzhou Road: Please the Bureau of Public Works to Plan Comprehensively

There is another similar proposal: "Several houses on the south side of the western section of Fuzhou Road, from the intersection of Baiguangxi Road to Pingwang Street, protrude from the intersection, obstructing traffic. The road should be widened immediately." Resolution: Passed in principle. Regarding the demolition of houses and widening of roads, please the Bureau of Public Works to plan comprehensively according to the road system. In addition, the Mayor submitted four cases for deliberation, including the "Draft Rules for the Address of Factories in Shanghai," due to the nature and importance of the content, please the senators study them first and discuss them at today's meeting.

Residents of Gaoqiao District Demand Impeachment: Senator Qu Willing to Hear the Reasons

Regarding the report that residents of Gaoqiao District demanded the impeachment of Municipal Assemblyman Qu Yue, Assemblyman Qu Yue submitted a letter to Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu yesterday to explain. The letter is excerpted as follows: "Today, I read in the newspaper that 'Two Thousand Residents of Gaoqiao Demand the Impeachment of Qu Yue,' knowing that residents of Gaoqiao District, Lu Dixiang, Xin Huanqi, etc., believe that this senator's actions in the past year have failed to live up to expectations. Since this senator was elected as a member of the Assembly, I have deeply felt that I have not contributed to the citizens. If I am summoned and dismissed, I can just close the door and reflect on my mistakes, and I can also rest. First, I did not know about it. Now that someone has presented it to the Assembly, I should take this opportunity to announce in public at the meeting the points that have failed to live up to expectations. Not only can this senator correct his mistakes, but also my colleagues in this Assembly can know that the member who is also the first elected district chief of Gaoqiao District, Zhong Yuliang (formerly known as Zhong Renjie), grew up in Gaoqiao and has served in local public affairs and is familiar with the people's sentiments. More than two thousand local citizens have this opinion, and there must be a full city of news. Whether he knows about it or because he has friendship and kinship with this senator, he specifically concealed it, may I ask him to give a brief explanation, and attach it together."

### The Assembly Will Adjourn Today: An Additional Session in the Morning

The agenda of the five general meetings of the Municipal Assembly has been extended for two days, and it has been decided to adjourn this afternoon.

The excerpt is as follows: Mao Runxiang (male, 34 years old, Ningbo native, residing at No. 38, Model New Village, Shanghai, manager of Yifeng Firm), Shao Jiazhen, Guo Ziming (both males, age, origin, and address unknown), Shao Shuping (male, age unknown, residing in Lifengyong Firm, Diandang Street, Shanghai), Shi Yiping (male, age unknown, residing at Xinbeimen, Shanghai, manager of Yifeng Company), Ye Lin (male, age unknown, residing at the intersection of Shilu, Ermalu, Shanghai, manager of Tianhe Firm), Ma Yongnian (male, age unknown, residing at Room 57, No. 119, Renji Road, Shanghai, manager of Minfu Company). The right-handed defendant's bribery case No. 4136 in the year 36 of the Republic of China has been concluded after investigation and is deemed to be prosecuted. The facts and evidence of the crime and the legal articles involved are described as follows:

Facts of the Crime

Mao Runxiang is the manager of Yifeng Firm in Shanghai. In August 35, the firm ordered 400 tons of galvanized iron from the Muji Genji factory in the United States. It was not shipped to Shanghai until September last year. As a result, the import license had expired, and it was difficult to import according to regulations. Mao Fengxiang, the general manager of the firm, and Mao Runxiang, the manager, wanted to pick up the goods, so they asked Fang Maolin to ask Shao Jiazhen, Guo Ziming, etc. to bribe Yin Lansun and others, who were assisting in the Jianghai Customs. Yin and others violated their duties and approved the import of the galvanized iron.

In October last year, Shao Shuping, because the aniline oil, 100 tons, that his service Lifengyong Paint Store purchased from the United States and shipped to Shanghai exceeded the amount stated on the import license, and there was also a batch of paint that arrived at the Shanghai port and had expired, could not be imported. Shao then asked Yang Shude to bribe Yin Lansun and others, who were assisting in the Jianghai Customs, 330 million yuan in national currency, and they were allowed to import it without authorization.

Shi Yiping is an employee of Yifeng Company. In October last year, there were 150,000 pounds of wool shipped from England to Shanghai. Because it was more than the amount stated on the import license, he also asked Yang Shude to dredge up Yin Lansun, bribing him with 300 million yuan in national currency, and he privately released the goods.

The Tianhe Firm that Ye Lin served and the Dakang Firm jointly ordered 64 barrels of paint in the United States. There was no import license originally. It was shipped to Shanghai in October last year, and the license of Xinfu Company was borrowed. According to the rules, the customs was declared. Ye Lin knew that it could not be imported according to law, so he asked Yang Shude to dredge up and bribe Yin Lansun and others, who were assisting in the Jianghai Customs, with 90 million yuan in national currency and smuggle the goods in.

Feng Yongnian is the manager of Minfu Company. In September last year, there were 17.5 tons of paint and 605 barrels of caustic soda shipped from overseas to Shanghai. There was no import license. He asked Chen Liangwang to dredge up the Jianghai Customs and bribe Yin Lansun and others with 120 million yuan in national currency and 16,000 US dollars. He borrowed the paint license of Jinshan Company and bribed Sun and others. Fang also repeatedly asked Zhang Gaozhen, Shao Jiazhen, Guo Ziming, etc. to dredge up Yin and others with 8,000 US dollars, etc., which has been repeatedly admitted by Yin Lansun and Zhang Gaozhen. Moreover, Yifeng Firm is jointly opened by the defendant and Mao Runxiang, and the defendant also assumes important responsibilities, then he and Mao Fengxiang and others obviously have a connection of criminal intent, and they are not allowed to quibble empty words. Furthermore, it was found that the defendant Shao Jiazhen and Guo Ziming went to Zhang Gaozhen for the report of the galvanized iron of the Lukenji Construction Factory

### Yin Lansun, a Prisoner Awaiting Death for Corruption, Appeals and Requests a Retrial

[Our Report from Nanjing, 5th] Yin Lansun, the main culprit in the corruption of the Jianghai Customs Currency Case, was previously sentenced to death by the Capital District Court. It is now known that his defense statement has been drafted by lawyer Fu Kuangyuan and submitted to the District Court. The District Court has recently submitted the entire case file for sentencing to the Supreme Court. In addition to stating that this bribery was caused by the deception of others and could not help himself, the defense attached a certificate from the Customs Service, listing (1) meritorious service in the withdrawal of the Minhai Customs in 33 years, and (2) 18 years of service in the Customs, with excellent work performance, a rare Customs officer, requesting the cancellation of the original sentence and a retrial. Filling in the burning item's muddled declaration, openly importing

Evidence of Crime

It was found that Lukenji Construction Firm had an inquiry with Yifeng, and ordered 400 tons of galvanized iron. When it was shipped to Shanghai in September last year, it was overdue and needed to wait for Shen Qing to change the date before it could be imported. The general manager of the firm, Mao Fengxiang, etc., were eager to pick it up, so they asked Fang Maolin to ask Yin Lansun, who was assisting in the Jianghai Customs, to ask Mei Futang to ask Yin, who was handling the Jianghai Customs, to bribe him. It was also confirmed by the Security Bureau that the matter was verified after sending personnel to Shanghai, and there is an original file to check. Furthermore, according to Zhang Gaozhen's confession, he gave 600 US dollars to the defendant Shao Jiazhen and Guo Ziming for the Lukenji galvanized iron incident. Based on the above, it is beyond doubt that the defendant Mao Fengxiang, Shao Jiazhen, and Guo Ziming paid bribes.

The Anil Lin oil and paint shipped from the United States to Shanghai by Lifeng Shui Paint Store, the wool shipped from England to Shanghai by Yifeng Company, and the paint jointly purchased from the United States by Tianhe and other firms, either had expired when they arrived at the port, or the imported goods exceeded the amount stated on the import license, or there was no import license, and the license of other companies was borrowed. The defendants Shao Shuping, Shi Yiping, and Ye Yunlin separately asked Yang Shude to dredge up Yin Lansun and others, who were assisting in the Jianghai Customs, and paid bribes. The defendant Shao Shuping bribed 330 million yuan in national currency, the defendant Shi Yiping bribed 300 million yuan in national currency, and the defendant Ye Yunlin bribed 90 million yuan in national currency, and smuggled the paint and other items that were not allowed to be imported according to law, which Yang Shude confessed to be true.

In September last year, Minfu Company shipped 17.5 tons of paint and 605 barrels of caustic soda from overseas to Shanghai. The defendant Feng Yongnian asked Chen Liangwang to introduce and bribe Yin Lansun and others, who were assisting in the Jianghai Customs, with 120 million yuan in national currency and 16,000 US dollars, and borrowed the license of Jinshan Company to smuggle them in. Chen Liangwang stated the facts clearly, and the facts were obvious.

In summary, the defendants separately paid bribes to civil servants for behaviors that violated their duties, which constitutes the crime of Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. A public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230 and Article 243 of the Criminal Procedure Law and sent for trial. Prosecutor Tian Jihou.

### Flying General's Lawsuit Against Wife: Defendant Cannot Be Arrested

[Our Newspaper's Report] After Du Qin, the wife of Flying General Wang Zhuo, eloped with the translator John, Wang went to Tianjin to find Du and brought her back to Shanghai. Not long after, Du left home again. Wang filed a lawsuit with the District Procuratorate. During the court hearing a few days ago, Wang accused Du of being unfaithful, while Du accused Wang of abuse. Each side insisted on their version of events. As a result, Prosecutor Liang Gengshun ordered the defendant Du Qin to post bail. At yesterday's hearing, Wang claimed that Du's guarantor was an unemployed vagrant and completely unreliable, posing a flight risk. Furthermore, Wang claimed that Du had instigated several soldiers to take Wang to the Lujiawan Police Station a few days ago, where he was secretly interrogated for several hours. He protested to Chief Yu about this incident afterward. Yesterday, when he arrived at the court, a squad of military police was stationed outside for protection. He requested Prosecutor Liang Gengshun to issue an arrest warrant to bring Du to court. Prosecutor Liang immediately dispatched a bailiff accompanied by Wang to arrest her. However, after searching Du's residence, they failed to find her and returned empty-handed.

### Charges Against Zha Liangzhu and Fang Zexian Dismissed: District Procuratorate Declines to Prosecute; No Falsehoods in Equipment Requisition; Machine Exchange Not Considered Embezzlement

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zha Liangzhu, the chief of the Engineering Section of the Pinghan Railway Zhangluo Section Engineering Office, and Fang Zexian, the manager of the Asian Industrial Company, were previously accused of collusion and embezzlement. After investigation by District Prosecutor Lu Zhennan, the District Procuratorate announced yesterday that it would not prosecute. The original text of the decision not to prosecute stated, in brief: The repair of the Guanyindong Bridge, Tongguanshan Tunnel, and Heishiguan Bridge, all under the jurisdiction of the Zhangluo Section, was urgently needed, but the required equipment was not readily available. Therefore, Wu Shien, the director of the Engineering Office, sent Zha to Shanghai to procure the equipment and authorized him to handle the matter with full authority. After arriving in Shanghai, Zha requisitioned 300,000 pounds of bamboo-joint steel and 200,000 pounds of bolts from the American Surplus Materials department of the Executive Yuan. Subsequently, because the requisitioned bamboo-joint steel and bolts were not entirely suitable, Zha exchanged 150,000 pounds of bamboo-joint steel and 100,000 pounds of bolts with Fang Zexian, the manager of the Asian Industrial Company, for two 250-horsepower diesel engines, one 150-horsepower diesel engine, and one temperature regulator, which were then transported to the Engineering Section for use. The Ministry of Transportation suspected Zha of collusion and embezzlement with Fang and sent a letter to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Before the Defendant Zha Liangzhu exchanged materials with the Asian Industrial Company, he telegraphed Wu Shien, the director of the Engineering Office, for approval. Even if Zha was not authorized to do this, and even if he did not follow auditing procedures, it would still only be an administrative matter and hard to hold him criminally liable. Furthermore, the quantities of bamboo-joint steel and bolts that Zha requisitioned from the Executive Yuan matched the numbers in the inventory of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau's Industrial and Mining Materials Depot. There were no falsehoods. It is also a fact that these materials were American surplus materials, complex in variety and not entirely suitable. Exchanging the unsuitable equipment for machinery urgently needed by the Railway Bureau cannot be immediately considered an act of embezzlement. The bamboo-joint steel and bolts were valued at a total of $38,000 USD, so half of that would be $19,000 USD. Zha Liangzhu exchanged that for the machinery which was valued at $20,400 USD, this cannot be said to have caused any losses to the Railway Bureau. Furthermore, according to the testimony of Agrevanov, the American manager of the Weili Han Foreign Firm, "In February of the 36th year of the Republic of China, each 250-horsepower diesel engine was valued at $18,500 USD in America." The exchange of bamboo-joint steel and bolts for machinery was not only not harmful to the Railway Bureau, it was also extremely beneficial. In summary, since there is no definite evidence to prove that the Defendants Zha Liangzhu and Fang Zexian colluded to embezzle and harm the Railway Bureau, according to Article 268 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the suspected crimes of the Defendants, etc., are still insufficient. In accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Ordinance, and Article 231, Category 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the decision is not to prosecute.

### Truck Accident on the Xihu Road: One Passenger Dies Tragically; Body Buried to Cover Tracks

[Our Newspaper's Report] A No. 02.2074 truck owned by the Huili Transportation Company on the Haining Road was hired to transport 58 piglets from Wuxi back to Shanghai on the 1st. The company dispatched driver Gan Linggen and handyman Du Changyuan. A pork merchant also hitched a ride, and the three of them squeezed into the cab, leaving no space. At 5:30 PM, when the truck reached Zhoushanbang in Wuxi, a police officer from the local police station stopped the truck, claiming that a friend of his, Liu Tenghui, wanted a ride to Shanghai. Unable to refuse, but with the truck already full of piglets and no space, they reluctantly allowed Liu to ride on top of the tarpaulin.

About three hours into the journey, as darkness deepened and they entered the territory of Taicang in the Zhintang Highway near Qipu Bridge, the road became narrow and uneven. Suddenly, the truck's headlights broke, and the driver, in a moment of panic and carelessness, caused the truck to overturn. People and pigs were thrown all over the ground, causing numerous injuries. Fortunately, the three men inside the cab were not seriously injured. After struggling out of the cab, they turned back to look at the passenger on top of the truck only to discover that he had been severely injured and was already dead. There were also six dead pigs nearby. After consulting with each other, in order to destroy the evidence of the crime, they moved Liu's body to a tomb about 200 yards south of the accident site, piled it with mud bricks, and buried the body to cover their tracks. Afterwards, they righted the truck, repaired the engine, and drove back to Shanghai. The next day, the truck owner inspected the vehicle and found damage in many places. Furthermore, the two men looked exhausted and suspicious, so he questioned them severely. The two men, feeling nervous and scared, finally confessed the entire story. The owner, understanding righteousness, immediately led the two men to the Detective Division of the Municipal Police Bureau to turn themselves in. Chief Li dispatched section chief Zhu Mengwei, deputy section chief Ma Feimu, and photography section member Fang Meixian, along with Gan and Du, to the accident site to exhume Liu's body and photograph it for evidence. Currently, in addition to searching for the deceased's family, the police bureau will transfer Gan and Du to the District Procuratorate this morning to be prosecuted for the crime of negligent injury causing death.

### Travelogue of Shanxi (1) - Iron City Taiyuan

Yan Jun said: "I am sixty-six years old this year. I will never leave until I return the complete Shanxi to the country!"

[Our Newspaper's Air Report from Taiyuan on the 2nd] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the communist bandits were frantically scurrying around. During that time, the military mediation group gave the communist bandits a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. As a result, the broad spine of North China was stained red everywhere. The entire territory of Shanxi was left with only four isolated strongholds: Taiyuan, Datong, Linfen, and Yuncheng. 30,000 shells destroyed Datong, but in front of the broken walls and ruins, the enemy was defeated in the face of the extremely strong struggle of the army and people. Yuncheng is adjacent to Shaanxi Province on the east bank of the Yellow River. With the Jincheng River to the north of the river, it is an important town at the southern end of the Datong-Pukou Railway, which runs through Shanxi Province. But under the attack of communist bandits' forces, which were several times larger than the defending army, and with the siege of hundreds of unknown heavy guns, it finally fell, and the essence of southern Shanxi, including the people and all their wealth, was completely lost. Taiyuan has not dared to be spied upon by the communist bandits. Of course, this is because of the battle of Xiaoyi County in the northwest of Taiyuan last year, in which He Long's 200,000 troops were defeated. The main reason is that after General Yan Xishan returned from Kenanpo and "fought" his way into Taiyuan, the first thing he did was to build fortifications. He had seen the communist bandits' sinister intentions clearly during the eight years of the War of Resistance. The suburbs of Taiyuan are densely covered with more than a thousand bunkers and firebases, constructed from brick to steel and concrete, reflecting the fact that the communist bandits have transitioned from fighting bare-handed to possessing machine guns and heavy artillery, and the problem is no longer simple.

Deep Ditches, High Ramparts, Strict Fire Network

When the reporters got off the plane at the South Airport, the first thing that caught their eyes were these firing points that constituted the great plain fire network, deep ditches and high ramparts, a strong defense line against the communist bandits' wave attacks, probably unmatched anywhere. The airport was piled with cement and gravel, trains were running back and forth, and the loess plain was quiet and peaceful. White pigeons were still staying on top of the bunkers, basking in the sunlight. From the perspective of the overall military situation, Mao Zedong led more than 10,000 people from the Japanese prisoner-of-war group led by Kenji Doihara to occupy Xing County in northwestern Shanxi. Chen Yi arrived in Yicheng in southeastern Shanxi. Chen Geng returned north from Quwo. Wang Zhen's four brigades also moved north. Nie Rongzhen's troops fled from the Shanxi-Chahar-Suiyuan border area to the vicinity of Xin County. The target of approximately 200,000 troops seemed to be this iron city - Taiyuan. To say that an offensive would consume at least 400,000 people, so it is speculated that the intention may be to destroy the "soldier-peasant integration" self-defense organization of Shanxi Province, and secondly, to seize Baoding and control Beijing and Tianjin. "Defending to the end will inevitably fail", but today Taiyuan uses defense as a means of waiting for the opportunity to attack. Yuncheng can be said to be a lesson from the past. The use of troops is only zero points and one hundred points. A decisive battle between the main forces is inevitable, just as a fatal blow to the communist bandits is also inevitable. I have the same belief in victory as every soldier and civilian in Taiyuan and the eighteen counties and cities in the Taiyuan area regarding the strong armed forces of Taiyuan.

Political Facilities, Unique and Independent

Only by understanding these objective environments can one understand the origin of all the political facilities in the heart of Shanxi today. Shanxi was a relatively conservative and special province in the past, and it still cannot get rid of this norm. When the reporters paid a visit to General Yan, he said frankly: "I am a soldier. Most of the political measures I have taken are things that I had to do when they were imminent." The "Three Selfs Movement" of self-purification, self-defense, and self-government; the "Four Equalities" of equality in life, equality in right and wrong, equality in sacrifice, and equality in labor; the "Five Anti's" of anti-leftism, anti-rightism, anti-corruption, anti-harassment of the people, anti-exploitation, and anti-injustice; and the "Great Prohibition" of not allowing drug trafficking, drug addiction, gambling, counterfeiting, unfairness, and non-labor; the "civilian economy" based on the principles of simplifying life, protecting life, distributing work, and allocating products; and the "soldier-peasant integration" and other ways to solve the core problem of China's social economy, the land problem, in response to the communist bandits' "land reform," these slogans and methods that can be seen everywhere, appeared one by one under the amazing thinking power of the 60-year-old General Yan. Looking at Shanxi from the perspective of the country and the nation, no one can deny that these laws are the basic conditions for an administrative agency to exist firmly in the red torrent. Today, people who are frowning and worried about life all day long have reached the time when they should open their eyes and take a look at the people who are fighting for life and death.

Pillar Against the Red Tide, Fortress of North China

Shanxi's politics also has such a characteristic: General Yan is like an old grandfather, and the subordinates who follow him now are all the children and grandchildren of his former cadres. The handwritings have no official tone at all, like maxims and family instructions. In the process of governing Shanxi for forty years, he has always used his personality, thought, spirit, and attitude to smoothly promote this family-style government. This is a major factor that Shanxi has been able to become a pillar against the red tide and a fortress in North China.

Historical legend says that Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty rebuilt the new city of Taiyuan, and the streets were made in a T-shape. As a result, Shanxi's politics will always "run into nails." Once the "feng shui" was broken, people in Shanxi abandoned politics and went into business, creating the extreme prosperity of the ticket shops during the Qing Xianfeng and Tongzhi years. When a road in front of the Forbidden Army Mansion was changed into a cross shape, Yan Xishan's revolutionary army rushed into Taiyuan from the current Shouyi Gate.

General Yan said in response to reporters' questions: "I am not considering running for vice president, but only considering how to deal with the communist bandits. The country handed me a complete Shanxi with one hundred and five counties and one city, but today there are only thirty-three counties and one city left. I am truly sorry to the country. According to the regulations, I can retire at the age of sixty-two, but I am sixty-six years old this year. I will never leave until I return the complete Shanxi to the country!"

### Brave Troops of the Suiyuan Self-Defense Force: The Daqingshan Cavalry

[Our Newspaper Gui Sui, November 28th Airmail Dispatch] The remnants of the Sixth Column of the Communist bandit Nie Rongzhen, entrenched northwest of Manchuria, convened a cadre meeting in Duanwang Village, south of the city, late last month to discuss ways to evade our cavalry's pursuit and suppression. It was decided to issue an order to the cadres of each village to bury a large number of landmines at key road junctions, and to order each village to saw down large trees for use when necessary. The Communist bandits are exhausted and must use landmines and waste materials to stop the advancing pursuit troops. These troops, which this reporter is reporting on, are the Daqingshan Cavalry in the Chahar-Suiyuan Field Army.

The Daqingshan Cavalry is a elite force established by the people of Suiyuan themselves. From the autumn of the 26th year until the winter of the 36th year, the state provided them with excellent equipment. During these ten years, the Daqingshan Cavalry was active in the Daqingshan area, twenty miles north of Gui Sui city, for eight full years. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, they had a total of 20,000 officers and soldiers. After more than 500 active attacks and more than 1,000 passive sweeps and stealth attacks, only more than 5,000 well-equipped and sturdy cavalry remained after the victory of the War of Resistance. Their previous guns were entirely Japanese, and their current horses were entirely from the puppet Mongol army. The government did not spend a penny to establish an iron cavalry that roamed North China, which is also a valuable achievement of General Fu Zuoyi's clean and capable government in Suiyuan for sixteen years. The person who organized the Daqingshan Cavalry and opened up the Daqingshan Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Base was

The First Person

was Guo Huaihan, the captain of the Wuchuan Security Team. After the Lugouqiao Incident in July of the 26th year, General Fu Zuoyi was ordered to lead an expedition to northern Chahar. Before leaving, he told local officials to organize the people for self-defense. Guo Huaihan established the Fourth Route of the Suiyuan People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army from the original security forces of ten districts in Wuchuan, under the command of Yu Cunhao, the current president of the Suiyuan High Court. After Sui and Baotou fell, the First Route of Fengzhen, the Second Route of Baotou, the Third Route of Gui Sui, the Fifth Route of Tuoketuo and Qingshuihe, the Sixth Route of Liangcheng, and the Seventh Route of Sa County, and the Eighth Route of Guyang mostly gathered in the Daqingshan Mountains. In the spring of the 27th year, General Fu launched a counterattack on Gui Sui, and in the winter of the 28th year, General Fu entered Baotou. The Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army was active behind enemy lines, playing a significant restraining role. Unexpectedly, when Wuyuan was once lost in the spring of the 29th year, it was the first to be annexed by the Communist bandits. At that time, the ones who attacked the headquarters of the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army were Yao Zhe, the current commander of the Communist Sui-Mongolian Military Region, and Li Jingquan, the brigade commander of He Long's Third Field Brigade. This time, the Suiyuan Self-Defense Army suffered the greatest destruction, almost completely destroying the Daqingshan Anti-Japanese base. The person who re-captured the Daqingshan Anti-Japanese base and established the Daqingshan Cavalry at the same time is currently in

The Hebei Plain

is fighting, the young general Ouyou San. Ouyou San came from a very humble background. He was originally a child named Guo from Eerqintun in Salachi County. He was abandoned by his parents at the age of three and raised by the Swedish missionary couple Ebi Ke. After graduating from Gui Sui Middle School, he was admitted to the ninth class of the Cavalry Department of the Central Military Academy. After Nanjing was abandoned, he moved to the Chengdu Main School in Sichuan as an instructor. Hearing that the elders and brothers of his hometown were fighting against Japan in the Daqingshan Mountains, he resigned and followed back to Suiyuan on foot from Sichuan, passed through the enemy's blockade, and joined the forward command of the Self-Defense Army as a captain staff officer. When the Communist bandits attacked the forward command of the Self-Defense Army in the 29th year, he escaped one minute before his execution, disguised himself as a herder and gathered the scattered soldiers together. Two days later, he automatically regained the anti-Japanese base, thus establishing his leadership position in the Self-Defense Army.

In the spring of the 34th year, General Fu Zuoyi also let Ouyou San command the American-equipped army trained in Houtao to fight behind enemy lines. He and the American advisors were often stationed in Shuijiangoumen, twenty miles north of Sa County. Japanese soldiers lived in the old Sui railway station in Sui County and Xinaobao in Baotou. After nightfall, it became Ouyou San's world. During this period, the Daqingshan Cavalry avenged the hatred of the 29th year and destroyed the base established by the Communist bandits in Jingergou in Daqingshan. If General Fu Zuoyi did not have this unit of Ouyou San active behind enemy lines, it would probably have increased a lot of trouble in receiving Sui and Baotou, and it would not have been possible to breathe freely in the two dusty isolated islands when defending Sui and Baotou. After

The Siege of Sui and Baotou was Lifted

Ouyou San had more than one hundred cavalry and infantry. The general reorganized his cavalry into a provincial security division, and sent the infantry back to Wuchuan, Guyang, Taolin, and Zhan County to serve as local regiments. Ouyou San collected the old, weak, and disabled to cultivate land near Daolanhua. Ouyou San's prestige in the Daqingshan area was second only to Generals Fu and Xue. When he attacked Jining in the past year, more than 3,000 militia groups assisted him in pursuing He Long's troops. In the past year, General Fu Zuoyi relied on Ouyou San's Daqingshan Cavalry and an infantry division to stabilize the rear of Chahar and Suiyuan, and recovered Zuoyun Youyu in Yanbei, and went on an expedition to northern Shaanxi to relieve the first siege of Yulin.

The Daqingshan Cavalry, tempered for ten years, was officially reorganized into a powerful national defense force in the autumn of last year. In January of this year, it opened up to Hebei, and, like General Fu Zuoyi's two swords, pointed to Nie Rongzhen's bandit lair.

Major General Ouyou San is only thirty-seven years old this year and has been injured more than twenty times. Until now, there are still

Two Bullets

have not been removed from his knees, neck, and calves. Ten years of guerrilla life has tempered Ouyou San and his officers and soldiers into wild horses. Ouyou San goes to bed late every night and gets up before dawn. He uses short periods of rest like a horse instead of full sleep. The success of Major General Ouyou San proves the greatness of the people's armed forces. General Fu Zuoyi's cultivation of the Daqingshan Cavalry also points out a bright road for many military leaders to break through dangerous environments. (Our Newspaper Reporter Liu Yingyuan)

### Jurong Refugees Chopping Wood Leads to Bloody Tragedy

[Our Newspaper Jurong, 3rd Dispatch] Since last autumn, a large number of Huaihebei refugees have arrived in Xiashu and Qiaotou in this county. Due to the lack of relief, they have recently formed groups to chop down forests, trees, and mountain firewood in Jiaoli Township, Zhujiabian, and other places to make a living. In order to protect their property rights, the mountain people have frequently clashed. Unfortunately, at dawn on the (3rd) of this month, the mountain people sounded gongs and fired guns as a demonstration, triggering a confrontation. The two sides gathered about 2,000 people, as if facing a formidable enemy. The county government specially sent Wang Yuya, the police chief, to Xiashu and Qiaotou on the afternoon of the (2nd) for inspection. He was trying to mediate when gunshots were heard. He rushed to suppress the situation, but because the two sides were fighting each other, the order was chaotic and impossible to stop. As a result, three refugees were shot and four were seriously injured. They were escorted to Zhenjiang Hospital for emergency treatment overnight. Director Wang specially convened an emergency meeting of local Bao chiefs and gentry at 9 p.m. that night and organized a "3-3 Incident" aftercare committee to prevent the incident from escalating. The issues of comforting the families, treating the injured, and providing relief are still under discussion.

### Reader Scholarship Sponsored by this Newspaper; More than 100 Students Apply in the University and Middle School Groups

Because there are a large number of applicants for this "Reader Scholarship," and the scholarship is only 600 million yuan, the review results show that those who are qualified account for three-fifths, and the remaining two-fifths are unable to help due to the scarcity of porridge and many monks.

The content is richer than before, and the wording has been revised in many places. However, there is an urgent need for these new rules in various places. In order to reduce difficulties, the association will first announce the important changes to the track and field and women's basketball rules as follows:

(A) Key Points of Track and Field Rules

(1) The provision that there should be an approximate two-second pause between "Ready" and the firing of the gun at the start has been cancelled. The starter must fire the gun only after observing that all athletes are calm and consistent. (2) Starting blocks are now permitted for legal use. (3) For staggered starts on curved lanes, the starter should stand in a position approximately equidistant from all athletes. (4) Methods of judging rankings when the results are equal in high jump or pole vault: 1. The winner is the athlete with fewer attempts at the last cleared height. 2. If there is still no difference, the winner is the athlete with fewer failed attempts throughout the entire competition. 3. If it still cannot be resolved, the winner is the athlete with fewer attempts at the starting posture throughout the entire competition. (4) If it still cannot be divided, and it belongs to the resolution of the first place, make another attempt at the height of the last common failure. If the result of the fourth attempt is that two or more people jump over, then the height should be raised by two centimeters, and each should be given a chance to try once. If the results of the fourth attempt all fail, then it should be lowered to the height of the last successful jump, and try again once, so increase and decrease, and try once at each height, until the winner is judged. (5) If it cannot be divided and it is for resolving other rankings, then the two or more people are judged to be tied. 5. If the results are equal in field events where the winner is determined by distance, the second-best result of each attempt or throw should be used to determine the ranking. If the second-best results are also equal, then the third-best result should be used to determine the ranking, and so on. (According to the rules as amended, the results of each attempt or throw in the triple jump and throwing events must be recorded in full, not just the best result, so that there is no way to resolve the ranking). (6) New-style hurdles are used for the hurdles, and knocking them down does not affect the score.

(B) Key Points of Women's Basketball Rules

(1) Any forward can receive the ball in the center circle, without designation. (2) A player who runs out of bounds must return to the court at the point where they exited. (3) The boundary line is considered in bounds if it is in the neutral zone, and out of bounds if it is out of bounds. (4) When a timeout is called in the last minute of each quarter, the remaining time is added to the next quarter. (5) A jump ball is only awarded when players are holding the ball simultaneously. If there is a sequence in time, the ball belongs to the player who gained possession first. (6) It is a technical foul for an opponent to touch the ball with their hand when the ball is already in a player's hand (unintentional contact is not a foul). (7) There is no limit to the number of taps during a jump ball, but this is not allowed after the jumpers have left the circle. (8) During a free throw, the referee should place the ball on the free throw line for ten seconds, starting from the moment it is placed. (9) If a free throw is missed, the game continues unless it should be a dead ball. (The same applies to free throws for technical fouls) (10) At the start of each quarter, the center circle throw is taken by alternating teams. For subsequent center circle throws after a basket, the team that lost the point takes the throw. (not alternating) (11) Violations: 1. Over the line, 2. Holding the ball for more than the allotted time, 3. Traveling, 4. Throwing the ball into the basket by a backcourt player, 5. Throwing the ball during a dead ball, 6. Bringing the ball into the court, 7. The player throwing the ball into bounds touches the ball, 8.

Official personnel entering the court without permission, 3. Calling more than three timeouts, 4. A player participating in the game for the fourth time. (10) (4) Personal fouls: 1. Obstruction, 2. Pushing, 3. Blocking (or without physical contact), 4. Hindering or touching.

### Social Bureau Strictly Enforces Rice Rationing Details: Rice Purchase Certificates Prohibited from Lending or Transferring, Preventing Citizens from Exchanging Rationed Rice for White Rice at Rice Shops. Yesterday, Another 3 Million Guan of White Rice Left Northern Shanghai.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The rice market continued to rise yesterday. According to Ji Mingzhai, chief of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau, the reason for yesterday's rice price increase was that citizens were exchanging rationed rice for white rice at rice shops by paying a price difference. Rice merchants were therefore absorbing large quantities of white rice in the market for exchange purposes. After discovering the above situation, the People's Food Allocation Committee, in accordance with Article 17 of the Detailed Implementation Rules of the Temporary Measures for Rice Rationing per Capita in Shanghai: "Various rice purchase certificates must not be lent or transferred. If there is a violation of the above situation, both the lender and the recipient shall be fined five times the amount for the first offense, and the penalty shall be doubled for each subsequent offense." The committee has dispatched supervisors to secretly investigate in various districts. If such a situation is found, it will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Article 17.

The re-emergence of 3 million guan of white rice outside the city, coupled with the rising prices in Xishi, has affected the people's hearts in Shanghai. The arrival of goods is also small, and with the easing of funds among the industry, it has further promoted the rise in the rice market. Yesterday, the rise in the northern market was greater than in the southern market. The price of white rice in the northern market reached 3.05 million yuan, and the price of special high-quality rice even reached a high of 3.14 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan. In the southern market, white rice was only 2.92 million yuan, Zhejiang rice was 2.9 million yuan, and special rice was 2.97 million yuan, each higher than the previous day by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Xian rice was relatively strong, with Wuhu machine xian rice at 2.8 million yuan, an increase of more than 100,000 yuan compared with the previous day. Yesterday's total arrival of goods in the north and south markets was 7,766 shi.

Flour

The rice market has risen again, and tin prices are also high. Even if the northern gangs do not take action, people's hearts have already wavered. With ample funds, the owners are reluctant to sell. Lao Che flour opened at 1.38 million yuan, but the Nahu also expressed indifference to this high price, causing it to soften later and fall back to 1.36 million yuan, which is 30,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Bingchuan flour was 1.34 million yuan, and the market was more stable. Jiangfeng and Jiancheng were the softest in the market, but rebounded at the close, each closing at 1.33 million yuan. Bran was flat, with the wheat flour factory at 1.9 million yuan.

Cooking Oil

The initial price of soybean oil returning to the market was very low. Dayou soybean oil opened at 6.08 million yuan, and there were a few transactions. The low price attracted buyers, and sales suddenly became smooth in the middle, so it rose steadily, closing at 6.25 million yuan, 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Other soybean oils also rose. Jiton's raw oil ranged from 7.15 million to 7.2 million yuan, similar to before. Raw vegetable oil rose by 100,000 yuan. Little Car's sesame oil was stable. The Taiwanese gang of bean cake buyers actively absorbed it, rising after being flat. Changzi cake was 720,000 yuan, and the others were 710,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Yellow beans experienced many twists and turns. The morning opening was stable. The Hakka gangs did not move, and the owners were unwilling to sell at low prices. Hankou Zha beans opened at 1.5 million yuan, and the Hakka gangs came to take them, pushing the price up to 1.55 million yuan. Later, the Hakka gangs suddenly stopped buying, and the price returned to 1.5 million yuan. Finally, the bean cake rose, and the oil factories came to buy, so the market recovered again, rising to 1.55 million yuan, but it was not easy to buy. There were buyers from the Qingdao gang at the morning opening of corn, and the market rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Jishu corn was priced at 1.91 million yuan. Although the Qingdao gang bought, their appetite was not big, and the price tended to fall, eventually remaining the same as the previous day. Sesame and white sesame rose slightly by 20,000 yuan, and the market was stable. Jianqing was flat, and red sorghum rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. Dugshengren rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, due to the strong buying by the Guangdong gang. Qinhuangdao Dugshengren was priced as high as 4.1 million yuan, and Dawenkou Dugshengren was priced at 3.9 million yuan, an increase of 300,000 yuan.

### Food Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market increased by another 5 yuan to 150 yuan in Taiwan dollars, and the quota for the tenth phase was reduced, and the trend continued to tighten. The association's pricing, the current spot price of one and four crude white was 3.935 million yuan, four and a half carts of white bagged goods were 4.12 million yuan, grass bags were 3.8 million yuan, and oil by-products were 580,000 yuan. 20 sand white was 3.55 million to 600,000 yuan, a rise of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, respectively.

The atmosphere in the consignment note trading market was tight. The eighth phase of medium sand white was priced at 1.59 million to 1.9 million yuan, the ninth phase of crude white rose from 970,000 yuan to 1.25 million yuan, the tenth phase of medium sand white was 930,000 yuan to 1.14 million yuan, and the four and a half white was 1.13 million yuan to 470,000 yuan, with the most significant increases.

Due to the inverted production costs, local sugar also followed the upward trend. Shantou Qing was 2.558 million yuan, a rise of more than 100,000 yuan. Xingbai was 3.7 million to 600,000 yuan, and Xingchi was 2.6 million to 640,000 yuan, a rise of 200,000 yuan. Diaoqing was 2.5 million to 520,000 yuan, and Shunde Qing was 2.53 million yuan, both rising by 170,000 to 180,000 yuan, with a total of 1,000 pieces being opened.

### First Batch of 350,000 Bags of Flour Transported to Pingjin from Jinan

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to uniformly handle the transportation of flour to Pingjin from Jinan, the Central Trust Bureau specially advanced funds to the Fourth District Flour Association to purchase a total of 350,000 bags in the first batch. The flour price will be calculated based on the price of wheat in Wuxi. It is now learned that in order to cooperate with the policy of the Ministry of Food, the Fourth District Flour Association is trying to prevent fluctuations in the price of wheat in Xishi, so as to avoid extra losses to the government. In addition to notifying the factories in Xishi and the purchasing agencies of other factories stationed in Xishi not to raise the price of wheat, they are also closely watching for any other institutions raising the price of wheat in the area, and plan to report to the Ministry of Food when necessary for effective prevention.

### The Bull and Bear Psychology Diversify, Chinese Stocks See Both Glory and Shame

Chinese stocks rose and fell repeatedly yesterday. Except for Maya, which fell to the limit, and Zhongxing and Zhongfa, which rose to the limit, the remaining stocks were generally volatile. Although Yongsheng had internal support and external encouragement, the high price was not easy to maintain and eventually closed lower.

The morning opening was stable. Yong Sheng opened at prices of 1,195 yuan and 1,255 yuan. After the opening, it first fell to 1,190 yuan and 1,250 yuan. Number 153 and others submitted increasing prices. Number 165 and others immediately made the delivery, rising to 1,215 yuan and 1,280 yuan. Number 152 and others vigorously sold for immediate delivery. Number 202 and others divested themselves and submitted the delivery. Funds became tight, especially among insiders, falling to low prices of 1,170 yuan and 1,237 yuan. At this time, miscellaneous stocks went in the opposite direction. Zhongfa had a large number of people fighting to absorb cheap ones, rising rapidly and unexpectedly reaching the upper limit. Maya sold small quantities and reached the lower limit. Zhongxing Steamship reached the upper limit, and the situation was uncertain. However, the insiders were very optimistic. Foreign stocks and cloth rose. Number 224 and others increased their immediate delivery. Number 35 and others increased the submission of deliveries, especially Number 224, which absorbed immediately and delivered. Number 104 was the most diligent in submitting deliveries. Yong Sheng rose again to new peaks of 1,230 yuan and 1,305 yuan. Funds were unfavorable to the bulls. Number 95 and others sold vigorously for immediate delivery. Number 188 and others jointly settled for delivery. The noon closing fell to low prices of 1,165 yuan and 1,235 yuan. Rumors helped the selling. The price of cloth fell slightly, and the selling trend turned prosperous. Compared with the previous closing, stocks for immediate delivery, Maya fell to the limit and then rebounded, with a strong half-cent increase. Zhongfa rebounded after rising to the limit, rising by 10%. Zhongxing rose to the limit. Xinhua and Yonggong were still flat. Rongfeng Innerwear rose slightly. Zhongsi, Zhongni, Zhongfang, and Hengfeng fell by half a cent. The rest fell slightly. Stocks for delivery, Maya and Jingfu fell by half a cent. Xinhe was flat. Yongsheng, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng fell slightly.

With reduced pressure on the market, Yong Sheng slightly rose to 1,190 yuan and 1,260 yuan at the opening. Number 157 and others made the delivery. Number 105 bought on average every week. Number 54 submitted the delivery, rising to 1,215 yuan and 1,270 yuan. Number 232 and others submitted the delivery. Number 163 came out for immediate delivery and reported a rebound. However, because Number 13 and others sold, and Number 36 and others bought, coupled with the small amount of National Bank intervention, a stalemate was formed. Before the close, Number 104 and others closed out Yongsheng, falling to low prices of 1,180 yuan and 1,228 yuan. The closing price was 1,188 yuan and 1,238 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning's close, stocks for immediate delivery, Xinhua, Jinglun, Yonggong, and Commercial Press were flat. Zhongfa rose to the limit. The rest saw minor gains and losses. Unlisted stocks traded off-market, with Xinxin and Dasheng rising by 10% being the most popular. Cultural and Public Utilities were only slightly stable.

### National Bonds Flourish, Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise

Government bonds continued to flourish, with a turnover of approximately 4 million yuan. Reports of currency reform mentioning silver coins boosted morale. Unified C opened at 96,000 yuan and rose to a peak of 110,000 yuan before falling back. Rooms 550, 360, and 549 were sold. Rooms 614, 552, 555, and Dachengxing were bought, with A, B, and E rising by 4,000 yuan, C rising by 9,000 yuan, and Type D also rising by 5,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks continued to be bought continuously, reaching new peaks. Yi Sha opened at 1.22 million yuan, and the market price soon approached the 1.4 million yuan mark. Securities firms and Guangdong gangs were buying. The supply from retail investors was limited. As a result, compared with the previous close, Wheelock Marden, Yeguang, Yida, Hangye, and Steel each rose by more than 10%, and the rest rose by more than half a cent.

### Artificial Silk Recovers After Fatigue, Factory Silk Reaches New High Price

The artificial silk market was weak at first yesterday. Following the rise in factory silk, people's hearts were slightly boosted. No. 120 Xu's word had light, the market opened at 52 million yuan in the morning, then gradually rose, the maximum was 60 million yuan, recovered to 58 million yuan at noon. The afternoon was very stable, the largest was 9 million yuan, and the closing was 7 million yuan, which was 6 million yuan higher than the previous day.

The factory silk market rose again yesterday, and the prices of all levels reached new highs. The shouting price for the C grade was around 95 million yuan, and the shouting prices for other grades were more than 10 million yuan higher than the previous day. However, no transactions were made for the five-shoulder grades. The high retail price opened at 90 million yuan, and the intermediate retail price was around 5 million to 6 million yuan. The high retail price of dried silk was priced at 60 million yuan.

The raw silk market was solid yesterday. The satin quilt market was stable, the grid was 10,000 yuan higher than the previous day, and other goods were also firm. Huaxia True Silk Quilt opened at 2.7 million yuan in the morning, and the price was traded. It was soon hovered at between 50,000 and 600,000 yuan, and the immediate-term closing price was 3 million yuan. Dacheng grid crepe opened at 294,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan with several pieces traded, and closed up to 350,500 yuan.

### Fine Yarn Firm, Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a positive opening as those with ample funds bought on sight, and merchants from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions showed strong interest, driving prices steadily upwards. Near closing, however, due to resale activities from Guangdong merchants and short selling, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn, after initially rising, fell back to 129 million yuan, a slight increase of 2 million yuan from the previous day. The 21-count Double Horse yarn initially rose but then declined by 500,000 yuan, with warehouse receipts also falling by 500,000 yuan. Other grades of coarse yarn, such as the 20-count, saw sluggish sales and generally declining prices, ranging from 400,000 to 1.78 million or 1.8 million yuan. Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with significant pressure from Shanxi merchants selling, leading to a brief dip in quoted prices. However, due to urgent shipments of goods previously released by Hankou merchants, there was strong demand for "yuan bi ji" (a type of fine cloth), and dyeing factories also actively purchased grey cloth at lower prices. Cloth merchants then moved to cover their positions, and prices gradually rose.

Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, with merchants buying more than selling, rose directly to 2.95 million yuan at closing, echoing the frenzied surge of other fine cloths by 180,000 to 100,000 yuan. The Four Gentlemen "bi ji" saw a dramatic increase of 210,000 yuan due to the Spinning & Construction Company's prolonged absence from the market and Hankou merchants' acquisition activities. Additionally, colored cloth and high-end 190 Shilin cloth also saw lively sales, rising by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Grey cloth manufacturers were optimistic, and market sentiment was buoyant.

Spinning & Construction Company Sells Yarn

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the China Spinning & Construction Company sold ten types of yarn as usual, totaling 952 pieces, equivalent to 1507.5 pieces of 20-count yarn, to 409 approved buyers. The opening prices for each type of yarn were as follows: 20-count Lucky Elephant at 67.5 million yuan, 6-count Sub-Sunlight at 34 million yuan, 8-count Sunlight at 37 million yuan, and 10-count Li Ma cone yarn at 44 million yuan. 32-count Joyous Crane at 90.5 million yuan, 32-count Double-Strand Harvest at 112 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight cone yarn at 99 million yuan, and 40-count TK Colored Ball at 129 million yuan.

Cotton Purchase Statistics

Furthermore, the company continued to purchase cotton stored by cotton merchants yesterday, including 200 pieces of Shashi cotton at 14 million to 14.15 million yuan, 21 pieces of Anqing cotton at 11.2 million yuan, and 151 pieces of Shaanxi cotton at 15.7 million yuan. There were 216 postal packages of Shangqiu cotton at 12.7 million yuan and 300 pieces of Yuyao cotton at 10.7 million yuan.

### Resolution of Unified Tax Burden Issue

The Six District Cotton Spinning Association repeatedly presented its views to the Yarn Management Committee regarding the issue of how to bear the increased unified tax on warehouse receipts for spun cotton yarn that had not yet been picked up: (1) If the factory has no physical stock available for warehouse receipts of spun cotton yarn upon maturity, the factory should bear the increased unified tax after the expiration date. (2) If the factory has sufficient physical stock available for warehouse receipts of spun cotton yarn upon maturity, but the association has not picked it up, the holder of the receipt should bear the increased unified tax after the expiration date. The responsible department of the Yarn Management Committee expressed its agreement. However, to avoid past disputes, it hoped that cotton yarn released before February 23 would not be subject to consideration. The Six District Association believed that the previous day's report that the Yarn Management Committee required the spinning factories to bear the increased unified tax was unreasonable. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, representatives Wang Qiyu, Rong Erren, Liu Piji, and Zhu Zhuyi visited Chairman Yuan to present their reasons. Chairman Yuan adopted their views and approved the original proposal as mentioned above.

### The Bank of China Announces Overseas Remittance Figures for January

Totaling 60 Billion Legal Tender

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the Bank of China announced the overseas remittance figures processed by the bank in January, totaling 60,844,156,075.75 yuan. Although the absolute value in legal tender showed a slight increase compared to December of last year, the exchange rate for foreign currency was adjusted in January. Therefore, in terms of the absolute value of foreign currency, there was no actual increase. Among the overseas remittances from various regions in January, New York accounted for the largest share, totaling 42,118,415,762 yuan. London accounted for 5,326,810,938.75 yuan. Havana accounted for 698,257,000 yuan. Sydney accounted for 162,541,785 yuan. Calcutta accounted for 272,668,000 yuan. Rangoon accounted for 162,102,000 yuan. Singapore accounted for 68,950,000 yuan. Kuala Lumpur accounted for 18,650,000 yuan. Penang accounted for 43,546,500 yuan. Saigon accounted for 126,650,000 yuan. Batavia accounted for 9,926,000,000 yuan. Yangon accounted for 121,830,000 yuan. Foreign agent stores accounted for 1,001,774,000 yuan.

### Firewood and Charcoal Prices Rise Again Due to Scarcity

Yesterday's firewood and charcoal market saw an increase in the price of coal per "jin" (a unit of weight) by more than 40%, which led to a rise in wholesale prices. This resulted in unusually strong sales in this street, with steady purchases from households. Since the Lunar New Year, however, the arrival of goods has been limited, and the market's inventory has decreased, leading to a gradual rise in quoted prices. Chestnut firewood continued to rise by 20,000 yuan per "dan" (a unit of weight) to 240,000 yuan, mixed firewood to 210,000 yuan, pine firewood to 200,000 yuan, green charcoal rose to 800,000 yuan per "dan," white charcoal to 660,000 yuan, and black charcoal to 530,000 yuan, an increase of 10% to 20% compared to the previous day.

### Notice Regarding Food Exports to the United States: Five Requirements for Entry

The China Import and Export Trade Association recently learned that domestic food products exported to the United States and Hawaii should pay attention to the following points: (1) Items containing salicylic acid or saccharin (such as dried plums and sweets) are strictly prohibited from import. (2) The wording on the label must be in English. If Chinese and English are used in parallel, they must be consistent without any additions or subtractions. (3) The name of the goods must be accurate. (4) Before the goods are canned, they should be inspected to remove any deteriorated items and must be sealed with new methods according to US regulations. Furthermore, medicinal materials must be clean and free of insects to be considered qualified. Newly invented products must provide detailed descriptions of the various substances and usage, and they must be registered in the United States first.

### Commercial Briefs

Yesterday's timber market saw slightly firmer prices for foreign pine, stable prices for fir, and adjusted prices for plywood, rising to 324,000 yuan per sheet.

American Light Octopus Orchid Soap is of excellent quality and sold at a low price. It is said that the factory plans to produce in large quantities to meet demand.

### Decision to Start with Tung Oil for the Purchase of Important Export Goods; Tung Oil Exports in February Sharply Reduced Compared to January

The government has decided to continue purchasing important export goods. The purchase methods have been drafted by the National Economic Commission. The types of goods to be purchased are temporarily limited to six: tung oil, pig bristles, tea, soybeans, eggs, and raw silk, to be executed by the China Trust Bureau. It is understood that the implementation details of this method were finalized by the Executive Yuan's subcommittee on the 6th, and the China Trust Bureau can begin to handle it next week. The Executive Yuan has decided to start with the purchase of tung oil, followed by pig bristles, tea, raw silk, and the other five types. The purchase price will be determined by the Purchase Price Review Committee, with representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Agriculture, the Central Bank, the Transport Management Committee, and the China Trust Bureau participating. The price will be calculated based on the actual cost of production in the producing areas, taking into account the profits of producers as a principle. After the purchase, the exporters will still be entrusted to transport and sell the goods, and the profits and losses will be borne by the national treasury.

[Further Report] According to related sources: In February, my country's tung oil exports, Shanghai accounted for 3,100 tons, Hong Kong accounted for 3,000 tons. In January, the export volume, Shanghai accounted for 5,700 tons, Hong Kong accounted for 4,500 tons. The export volume of tung oil in February was significantly reduced. The reasons are: (1) The foreign exchange rate has not been adjusted with general prices, causing manufacturers to often have to donate about 50%. (2) The payment for export goods has not yet been liberalized. And most manufacturers should be in short supply of funds, and turnover is difficult. (3) The Yangtze River water level is still at a low tide, and cargo transportation is blocked. Therefore, most of the tung oil currently exported is early orders, and there are no new orders, so the pre-transportation prospects for tung oil exports in March are still very bleak.

### Wuxi Year-End Settlement for Various Industries: Silk, Yarn, Flour, and Rice are the Most Profitable; Longmao Rice Firm's Profit is Around 20 Billion

[Our Dispatch from Wuxi] In this county, the silk, yarn, flour, and food industries, due to long-standing practices, still settle their accounts at the end of the lunar year. Now, in the middle of the lunar New Year of Wuzi, the profits and losses for the year Dinghai have been fully revealed by various industries.

Judging from the overall year-end accounting situation of various industries last year, it seems to be better than the previous year. Although various industries were affected by currency fluctuations, the abnormal phenomenon of more legal tender and fewer goods was presented. However, because most of the people in charge of various industries were more cautious, they had raised funds around the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month to safely overcome the difficult year-end settlement. Even if there was cash released on New Year's Eve, there was a lack of inquiries, which was the opposite of the state of stores being busy adjusting funds on New Year's Eve in the previous year.

Even more gratifying is that regarding bad debt incidents, except for Fan Jiahua, who failed in speculative cotton yarn and flour and ran away with more than 700 million yuan, the other merchants safely passed through, and no such incidents occurred. The general situation of profits and losses of various industries is briefly described below:

Flour Mills

The flour mill industry, with larger scopes, includes Maoxin, Jiufeng, Zengfeng, Guangfeng, Huaxin, and other seven or eight companies. Last year, because transportation to the north was smooth, although raw material prices fluctuated from time to time, the flour price was still based on the wheat price, and the prices rose with the tide, so there was no impact. The factories were strong, and most of the raw materials were prepared in advance. They worked day and night, and the output was abundant. The sales were in the valley, and the prosperity of their business was unprecedented in recent years. Therefore, the profits were quite rich. Among the various industries in the county, it can be called second to none.

Yarn Mills

The first half of last year was the golden age of the yarn mill industry. The 20-count Double Fish yarn produced by large factories such as Qingfeng was the standard yarn in the cotton yarn market in Xiyi. The brand was well-known and was well-received by customers, so it was naturally a prosperous source of wealth and countless profits. Secondly, the Shenxin Zhenxin Yarn Factory has a large scope and abundant profits. In addition, small and medium-sized yarn mills also presented a vigorous atmosphere and each had a surplus, which was not much different from that of flour mills. Cloth mills had excessive expenses, and there was a slight surplus at the end of the year.

Silk Mills

There are more than 50 silk mills in the county. Last year, various factories were operating vigorously in the tide of prices. Most of the large factories were engaged in government-commissioned reeling, so the surplus was very small. The small and medium-sized silk mills went smoothly after the spring silkworms spread. The silk prices fluctuated sharply, especially the sales of silk for users were the best. However, due to the lack of raw materials, the factories stopped work early. In short, last year's silk mill industry was better than the silk mill industry in 1935.

Rice and Grain

The business of the grain market here is the crown of all the counties on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Merchants from various places transport rice, paddy, wheat, and miscellaneous grains to Wuxi in an endless stream. The total amount of daily transactions is more than 20,000 "dan." Various rice firms sell and buy on behalf of customers and charge commissions. General brokers hold sample bags and go to the market to discuss prices at 10 am. Last year, rice prices soared, jumping again and again. Therefore, more than 200 rice firms in the county were in full swing and mostly profitable. Longmao Rice Firm, which has strong financial resources, has a surplus of about 20 billion, and Yide Rice Firm also has more than 6 billion. The rice milling industry is also operating well and is in a state of surplus without loss.

Money Shops

Last year, various money shops in the money shop industry had stable loans, and were not affected by bad debts throughout the year, and they all received high profits. Especially the Yonghengfeng and Zengda money shops, the profits were the most abundant. The surplus of cooperatives and underground money shops is even more astounding. Commercial banks also have a surplus, but compared with underground money shops, they are far behind.

Oil Mills

In the Xiyi oil mill industry, the three with strong capital are Hengde, Runfeng, and Jiancheng. The daily output is more than 2,000 "dan." With the arrival of soybeans filling up, the oil pools of various factories are full and there is no place to store them. Last year, the oil was once sluggish, but at the end of the year, it was unique and repeatedly created new high prices. Each "dan" has been above the 4 million mark. Therefore, various factories have profits to be made. Except for Yuan Chunlong and Yuan Chunxin, one of the three major oil firms, each has a surplus. The various firms such as Yuan Da maintain expenses, and other firms have varying profits and losses.

Hotels

The larger hotels include Taishan, China, Jinghu, and Huizhong. In the midst of price fluctuations and economic turmoil, the impact on the entire business is mostly a loss. The other hotels such as Zhongnan, Dalu, Tianran, and Wanxin have successively added funds and reorganized. Other hotels also rely on high-interest loans to maintain themselves, quenching their thirst with poison. They all have a state of hanging upside down. Except for Yingsailou, which has a slight surplus, most of the restaurants are losing money, and medium-sized restaurants such as Yang Tianxing have some surplus due to saving expenses and fewer customer accounts.

Culture and History

### On the Era of the Stone Drums: A Response to Mr. Tong Shuye

— Tang Lan

I was kindly sent the sixty-eighth issue of the Shanghai Central Daily News Cultural Relics Weekly, dated January 7, by Mr. Di Zhongxiu, containing Mr. Tong Shuye's article "A Critique of Mr. Tang Lan's Theory that the Stone Drums Were Carved in the Third Year of Qin Linggong." I was very pleased after reading it. I had long anticipated criticism when I wrote that article, because people in general tend to be very conservative. When I say the Stone Drums date to the Warring States period, others invariably insist on Qin Wengong, Qin Xianggong, Qin Mugong, and some even claim King Cheng, King Xuan, or the Northern Zhou or Later Wei dynasties. Such are the inevitable outcomes of contentious debates rooted in stubborn biases. Nevertheless, amidst this chaotic era of high costs and scarce resources, the mere fact that individuals still engage in discussing these trivial matters should be cause for celebration.

I am most grateful for Mr. Tong's pointing out that, while I had stated that the Stone Drums use the character "過" eleven times, he has corrected it to fourteen. (There are a few other instances where Mr. Tong cites the original text with interposed dots, which I believe must be typographical errors.) Regarding the question of the "吾" character, Mr. Tong devoted considerable effort to demonstrating that the Book of Documents contains first-person pronouns such as "予," "我," and "朕." The character "予" is used in the singular nominative case, equivalent to the character "余" in bronze inscriptions. The character "朕" is often used in the singular possessive case, while the character "我" can be used in the singular, plural, nominative, and possessive cases. Therefore, Mr. Tong argues that I "only paid attention to the distinction between the possessive and nominative cases, but neglected the distinction between the singular and plural," and that I "did not understand pre-Qin grammar clearly" and "unfortunately failed to analyze the usage of even two or three inscription texts clearly."

Mr. Wang Dajin, a student at the Institute of Liberal Arts at Peking University, has researched pronouns in the Book of Documents. It was a graduate thesis from four or five years ago. The first-person pronouns he identified were similar to what Mr. Tong described, but the character "我" seemed to be used exclusively in the plural. I even offered some opinions on that thesis, so I am not likely to have forgotten that the character "我" represents the plural.

Here, I should first thank Mr. Tong for making me realize that my writing is not yet clear enough for even an old woman to understand, which is quite shameful. However, I also regret that Mr. Tong's intelligence has been employed in such a pointless and irrelevant discussion. The Book of Documents uses the three characters "予," "朕," and "我," but it does not use the character "吾"! According to Mr. Tong, the Stone Drums use the character "吾" and the Curse of Chu inscription uses the character "衙," which he claims is equivalent to "我." This is truly bewildering. We truly do not understand why the Stone Drums and the Curse of Chu inscriptions, since they both have the character "我," would need to write "吾" or "梧" instead. These two characters clearly derive their sound from "吾," which was anciently in the Yu rhyme group. Why not simply represent the classical character "吾" and the "慮" character in Eastern bronze inscriptions after the Spring and Autumn period, instead of representing the "我" character, which was anciently in the Ge rhyme group?

Shang and Zhou inscriptions use the character "我" in many places. Although Qin Gong Gui and Qin Gong Zhong do not use it, we believe it must have been in use at that time. However, the use of the character "吾" as a pronoun never appears in the Book of Documents or bronze inscriptions before the Spring and Autumn period. Therefore, we say that during such a period, only "余" (or 予), "朕," and "我" were used, and not "吾." However, in texts like the Book of Changes, the Analects, and Mencius, except when quoting ancient texts, "予," "吾," and "我" are used, and not "朕." Eastern bronze artifacts after the Spring and Autumn period, such as the Qi Jian, Huan Er Zhong, and Du Shi Hu, use "余," "慮" (or 衙), and "我," but not "朕." The boundaries here are very clear. Therefore, my original text only stated that the Qin Gong Gui era used "朕" and not "吾," and that the Stone Drums and Curse of Chu inscription eras used "吾" and not "朕." Because we have no way to prove that the Qin people first used the language "吾" and later changed it to "朕" and then back to "吾," we can only place the Stone Drums later, alongside the Curse of Chu inscription. By the time of Qin Shi Huang, the emperor referred to himself as "朕" precisely because this was an established language. Otherwise, no matter how much power Qin Shi Huang possessed, he could not have immediately banned a commonly used term!

Now, Mr. Tong identifies the character "吾" as "我" and also involves the question of singular and plural, which is truly "Zhang Gong drinking wine, Li Gong getting drunk." The Book of Odes clearly states "My chariots are strong, my horses are together." The Stone Drums follow this pattern but change it to "Our chariots are strong, our horses are together," which is a huge loophole. However, if we say that "吾" is equivalent to "我," a character from the Ge rhyme group that should harmonize with a sound from the Yu rhyme group, then the juxtaposition of the Stone Drums and the Curse of Chu inscription is merely for fun. Mr. Hu Shih's great work, "My Me Article," can be dispensed with, and I can do nothing about it.

As for the issues of the characters "沒" and "也," Mr. Tong says that the character "猗" in the Qin Oath is equivalent to "設," which is also something I do not understand. Mr. Tong also says that the character "猗" is equivalent to "兮," and the Record of Rites: Great Learning cites the Qin Oath's "猗" as "兮," which is reliable. It is only a pity that Mr. Tong contradicts himself, because "兮" is not equivalent to "也." For example, in "Uncle Xi, Uncle Xi, what long days are these!" we cannot reverse "兮" and "也." In that case, if "猗" is the same as "兮," then it has nothing to do with "也." If "也" is only the same as "毆," then why drag in "猗"? As for the Qin Feng Quan Yu, which says "Now, every meal has no remainder," I do not know when it should be dated, and the Preface to the Odes says it is satire on Duke Kang, but I do not know if that is credible. The structures of bronze inscriptions and texts on bamboo and silk are different. Bronze inscriptions are more conservative. Even if the character "也" was already in use at the time, it is possible that it was not used in bronze inscriptions. The character "也" was probably already prevalent in the Eastern states, but we only see the character "也" in the Chen Chang Dian Measure dating from the late Spring and Autumn period. This is precisely the reason. I already explained this in the Chen Chang Tao Measure Examination. The language of the Tang and Song dynasties was largely the same as it is now, but "you et al." and "we et al." are still not commonly seen in bronze inscriptions, which is a similar situation.

Mr. Tong says that I am "not a person who does not read books." I do not understand how to read books. If it is according to Mr. Tong's statement, "殹" is equivalent to "猗," and "猗" is equivalent to "兮," so "隊" is equivalent to "兮." I have certainly not read books in this way, and I do not deign to read them. (Zhu Junsheng, because the two characters "兮" and "也" in Mao's Odes are sometimes interchanged in other books, considers them to be interchangeable. Then, why do we not write all of the "兮" characters in Mao's Odes and the Songs of Chu as "也," or write all of the "也" characters as "兮"? The ancients were very clear about the boundaries of the characters they used. In sentences where "兮" and "也" appear together, it is clear that they are not interchangeable. The Book of Odes uses the character "維," and the Book of Documents uses the character "惟." The ancients were very clear about the boundaries of the characters they used. Ancient people often made mistakes when copying books, and the differences of one or two characters are not sufficient evidence. Zhu broke this boundary, and is truly misleading the people.)

Mr. Tong repeatedly says that I am "arbitrary" and also repeatedly says that I have "been poisoned by the current most fashionable trend of only asking about artifacts and not asking about documents." I do not want to accept the words "arbitrary." If I am making strict comparisons of the writing or grammar between materials from different sources, such as a carved stone written and engraved by the people of the time and things that have been copied down by many people from different times and regions, then I must admit that my method is flawed. Now I only use "bronze inscriptions," only "bronze inscriptions from the Qin state" for comparison. The difference in time is only a few hundred years, and I do not believe that this method is wrong. Mozi separated bronze and stone from bamboo and silk, and the Qin Second Emperor's edict referred to bronze and stone inscriptions together. Therefore, what was carved on carved stones was also carved on weights and measures, which shows that bronze inscriptions form a system of their own. For example, if ancient books use "予" to falsely claim that the former kings themselves acknowledged it, which is equivalent to the "余" character in bronze inscriptions, then it is equivalent to saying that bronze inscriptions do not use the "予" character. Is this "arbitrary"? In my original text, I said, "The bronze inscriptions of the Two Zhou Dynasties do not use the character '予,' and the radical for the character '迂' in the Stone Drums comes from '予.'" I never thought that it would involve the character "予" used as a pronoun in ancient books, because that is written as "余" in bronze inscriptions. What I was talking about was just the shape of the character, so I used "radical" as proof. Mr. Tong probably did not see my words clearly, and mixed the two together, thinking that I believed that the pronoun "予" or "余" was later in origin, so he said that "it is inevitable that there is some arbitrariness."

As for whether I have been poisoned or not, I do not want to argue, because people who have been poisoned may not know it themselves. However, I do hope that I have been poisoned by the "seeking truth from facts." One must "analyze" the usage of a character "clearly" and "understand" "pre-Qin grammar" "clearly," and not identify A as B, or A as A, and drag in things from all over the place and lump all the materials together, materials that are not necessarily equal.

"辟," "殺," and "迂" are the basis of my textual research on the Stone Drums era. As long as we think about it calmly, right and wrong are not difficult to determine. These are all very clear and certain pieces of evidence. Before they were brought up, one could go for thousands of years without realizing it, but once you paid attention, even I myself laughed. How could such obvious and straightforward facts be confused for twenty or thirty years? Now, this is a premise. If I have not been "arbitrary" in anything, then the Stone Drums must be placed after Duke Jing. Otherwise, everything I have said is nonsense, so I do not need to answer Mr. Tong's other comments.

### Origins of Dice Research

— Chang Renxia

I have previously published a study on the origins of Chinese chess in India, leading me to believe that Chinese dice also have Indian connections. Dice are small, six-sided cuboid recreational tools made of ivory, bone, or other materials. They are used for gambling games in many countries around the world, including China. According to Thomas Hyde, the origin of dice should be traced back to the evolution of knuckle bones. Ancient records also mention a game using pebbles, tossing them to get odd or even numbers, which should have developed alongside dice as a toy. Dice have six sides, marked with one to six dots, and are usually played by two or more people. Each set can have up to six dice, but commonly two or three are used, with two being the most frequent.

The game of dice likely originated in Eastern Asia. A clay die dating back to 2750 BC was discovered in Mesopotamia. A red pottery die was also found in Rajagriha, Central India, and is currently held by Ajit Ghoce, an archaeological collector in Calcutta, India. Rajagriha was the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Magadha in the 6th and 7th centuries BC before the birth of Buddha. Furthermore, Mr. Lin Xianxiang discovered stone axes from the Stone Age there. Therefore, although the exact context of the die's discovery is unclear, it is likely about 2600-2700 years old. (When the monk Faxian visited Rajagriha during the Jin Dynasty, it had already become a desolate ruin.) In addition, the Smithsonian Institution also holds three ancient dice: one from ancient Egypt and two from ancient Rome. All are completely similar to modern Chinese and Indian dice. The Western term for dice is "Dice," which is quite similar in pronunciation to the Chinese name. In ancient Greece, dice were a very common recreational toy. The ancient Greeks called them "Tec ares," and the ancient Romans called them "Teseerae," from the Latin "Tescera," which originated from the ancient Greek. Its original meaning was "four," because it represented something that was cuboid.

The ancient Romans were very fond of this type of entertainment. Mark Antony spent his days throwing dice in Alexandria. Emperor Augustus, Nero, and Claudius were also avid enthusiasts. Claudius even wrote a book about the game of dice. Caligula was a notoriously degenerate dice player. Domitian also enjoyed playing dice, and Commodus even built a special room in his palace for playing dice. Emperor Verus, the adopted son of Antoninus, was known to gamble all night throwing dice. These facts are documented in ancient texts. Moreover, the dice excavated from ancient tombs today prove that these are not fabrications.

Dice are depicted on surviving buildings in ancient Egypt, which were discovered in Thebes. This alone allows us to clearly understand the state of dice playing in ancient times. This dice game was very common in ancient Greece and Rome. As for the inventor of dice, it is attributed to Palamedes, who lived around 1244 BC. This Greek taught his countrymen the game during the siege of Troy. He was later offered as a sacrifice on the altar of the temple of fate. Today, we infer from ancient relics that gambling with dice may have existed even earlier.

Dice were found in ancient relics in Rajagriha, India, and are also mentioned in the ancient hymn collection Rigveda. This book dates back to 2000 BC, meaning dice have a 4000-year history in India. Another book from the 8th century BC, Upanisad, also mentions dice, calling them Aksa. The famous ancient Indian epic Mahabharata mentions a prince who lost everything by gambling with dice. Even today, dice are a very common gambling tool in India. Tibetans and Nepalese are also very fond of it. I saw them gambling with dice in large gatherings when traveling in Darjeeling in the Himalayas. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, this tool originated in Asia. Although it cannot be definitively stated that India is its earliest place of origin, it is certain that dice were popular in ancient India.

According to Chinese legend, Lao Tzu invented dice. The "Jiushi Zhenbian," published in the first year of Daoguang (1821), states that Lao Tzu saw the Miao people idle every day when he visited the Miao region, so he taught them the game of dice. Although "Jiushi Zhenbian" is not a very ancient book, this legend is based on something. The "Taiping Yulan," volume 726, quotes "Bowu Zhi" as saying that Lao Tzu entered the Western Rong tribe and taught them Hao Pu, which is the same source as this legend. However, Hao Pu is different from modern dice, which we should always be aware of. As for the earliest discovered Chinese dice, they are of a different kind and unlike the dice known in Europe and India. According to a letter from my friend Wei Juxian, Mr. Shang Chengzu once bought a stone die about one square inch in size in Beijing. It had fourteen sides, while modern dice have six sides. The fourteen sides were formed by removing eight corners from the cube. It was engraved with characters instead of dots. The characters were one, two, three, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, blank, a total of thirteen numbers, and one side was blank. The rules of the game are unknown. I have not seen the original object in Xiyong, but based on Wei Juxian's description, this die should be very ancient, with characters similar to those on oracle bones from the Yin Ruins. Seven was written as ten, and ten was written as a dash, as was the case in oracle bone script. This type of die was called "Qiong" in ancient China, named because it was made of jade or stone. Throwing Qiong to gamble was similar to throwing dice before gambling with dominoes or playing mahjong today. The "Liubo," "Wu Mu," "Hu Zhi He Lu," "Lou Pu," "Liu Zhu," and "Bo Sai" mentioned in ancient Chinese documents did not use modern dice, which I can prove separately. However, the northerners call playing dice "Shai Zi," which is a continuation of the ancient Chinese name. In ancient porcelain from the Six Dynasties period, a die about one square inch in size was found, completely identical to the dice excavated from ancient Egyptian and ancient Roman tombs, as well as modern Indian dice. This die was formerly owned by Professor Li Chaoshi of the National Academy of Art, who said he obtained it from Yuyao, Zhejiang, also from an ancient tomb. It is now in the collection of Wei Juxian. This is the earliest Chinese die of the same type as ancient Egyptian dice that I know of.

The development of dice into dominoes is a unique Chinese innovation. The dots on the two faces of a die are combined to form a domino. Through intricate combinations, thirty-two dominoes are formed. Dice can be said to be the foundation of dominoes. If there were no dice first, there would be no dominoes later. The custom of using dominoes for divination is very popular in Chinese folk culture. Originally, using cards for divination existed in many parts of the world. Before dice were used for gambling, they may have also been used for divination, similar to tossing heads or tails with a coin. The Chinese Liuren divination method uses three coins to cast divination, shaking them in a box, which is completely similar to the method of using dice. The origin is likely the same.

Chinese Yezi cards are another type of gambling tool besides dice. Today's mahjong tiles evolved from Yezi cards. They resemble dominoes but are not actually dominoes. According to Dr. Hu Shi's Mount Lu travelogue, he collected Yezi cards from various places, which will allow his penchant for research to trace the roots.

The Smithsonian Institution holds three ancient dice, 1 from an Egyptian tomb, 2 and 3 from Roman tombs, sketched by the author.

### Postscript to "A Chronological Biography of Shen Kuo"

— Xu Gui

(A Chronological Biography of Shen Kuo, written by Professor Zhang Yinlin, published in the Tsinghua Journal, Volume 11, Number 2, April 1926. It has been included in the posthumous work "Essays on the History of the Song Dynasty.")

According to the biography of Shen Kuo in the History of the Song Dynasty, "In the early years of Yuan祐 (1086-1093), he was transferred to Xiuzhou." Also, the "Letter of Thanks for Being Demoted and Appointed as the Deputy Commander of the Xiuzhou Military Training" in the Changxing Collection, volume 16, says: "I have been ordered to serve as the Deputy Commander of the Xiuzhou Military Training, stationed in this prefecture." It is known that Shen Kuo could not leave Xiuzhou before receiving the new order. In Professor Yinlin's original article, the entry for the fourth year of Yuan祐 states: "Kuo's move to Mengxi, Jingkou, must have been after he presented the map and received the award, and was granted permission to reside at his convenience." According to the "Continuation of Zizhi Tongjian Changbian" by Li Tao, entry for the Bingzi day (3rd day) of the eighth month of the third year of Yuan祐 (1088): "Shen Kuo, the Deputy Commander of the Xiuzhou Military Training, stationed in this prefecture and not allowed to sign official documents, was granted 100 bolts of silk and allowed to reside at his convenience, because Kuo presented the map of all prefectures and counties in the country." This matter is also found in the "Collected Drafts of the Song Huiyao," Penal Law 6, entry 20, but it is dated the 13th day of the eighth month. It can be seen that the presentation of the map and the award occurred in the third year of Yuan祐, not the fourth year. Also, the so-called "allowed to reside at his convenience" refers to being allowed to reside at his convenience within the territory of Xiuzhou, not being allowed to reside at his convenience in prefectures and armies outside of Xiuzhou. Also, the "Letter of Thanks for Being Appointed as a Secretary of Nanjing" in the Changxing Collection, volume 16, says: "On the 19th of this month, a messenger from Runzhou delivered an official notice, granting me the grace to be appointed as the Left Chao San Lang, guarding the Guanglu Shaoqing, Secretary of Nanjing, and allowing me to reside at my convenience in prefectures and armies outside of Nanjing." The Changbian records this decree on the Wuxu day (7th day) of the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐 (1090). Being allowed to reside at his convenience in prefectures and armies outside of Nanjing meant that he could also reside outside of Nanjing. This is important evidence that his actions were now free. Assuming that he moved to Runzhou immediately after receiving the new order in the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐, then the statement in the History of the Song Dynasty that "He lived in Runzhou for eight years and died at the age of sixty-five" should be calculated from the fifth year of Yuan祐 (1090), and after eight years, it would be the fourth year of Shaoxing (1097). If he died in the fourth year of Shaosheng (1097) at the age of sixty-five, then his year of birth would be the second year of Mingdao (1033), which does not match the original article stating that he was born in the first year of Mingdao (1032). Whether he moved to Runzhou in the fifth or sixth year of Yuan祐 is not certain, but it was definitely not before the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐. Based on this, it is clear that Shen Kuo was not born in the first year of Mingdao, but after the first year of Mingdao. Unless the original text of the History of the Song Dynasty is incorrect.

Also, the entry for the Jichou day (22nd day) of the ninth month of the fourth year of Yuan祐 (1089) in the Changbian states: "Shao was ordered to be demoted to the Deputy Commander of the Xiuzhou Military Training and stationed in Huangzhou. Shen Kuo was given the title of Chao San Lang, Guanglu Shaoqing, and was ordered to be demoted to the Deputy Commander of the Chengzhou Military Training and stationed in Huangzhou. Wu Juhou was given the title of Chao Feng Lang, Shaofu Shaojian, and both were appointed as Secretaries of Nanjing; (omitted) and both were allowed to reside at their convenience in prefectures and armies outside of Nanjing." This order was soon opposed by Liang Tao and Liu Anshi, so the same day there was an edict stating that Shao's "previous orders for Shen Kuo and Wu Juhou should not be carried out, and Shen Kuo should wait for further instructions." But one point to note is that before the Jichou day of the ninth month of the fourth year of Yuan祐, Shen Kuo had already moved to Huangzhou. As for the statement in the "Letter of Thanks for Being Appointed as a Secretary of Nanjing" that a messenger from Runzhou delivered the official notice, many people believe that Shen Kuo had already chosen to live in Runzhou before receiving the official notice, seemingly without noticing that "being allowed to reside at his convenience in prefectures and armies outside of Nanjing" was an important order that confirmed his freedom of action. It should be known that restricting residence is a kind of punishment, and not restricting residence is the removal of this kind of punishment, and there must be an explicit order to obtain freedom of action. The reason why the "Letter of Thanks" pointed out Runzhou was probably because Runzhou was an important hub for water transportation at the time, and some documents used it as a starting point for transportation.

### Reading "Postscript to A Chronological Biography of Shen Kuo"

— Ding Zeliang

Recently, the editorial department of the Wen Shi Zhoukan (Literary and Historical Weekly) forwarded me a letter from Mr. Xu Gui of Zhejiang University and his article "Postscript to A Chronological Biography of Shen Kuo." I would like to express my admiration for Mr. Xu's enthusiasm for correction and thank the editors of Wen Shi Zhoukan. Mr. Xu's opinion on the question of Shen Kuo's birth and death years differs from mine in "A Study of Shen Kuo's Birth and Death Years" (published in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao and Wen Shi Zhoukan, issue 29). The main difference is that Mr. Xu believes that Shen Kuo lived in Runzhou starting in the fifth year of Yuan祐, while I believe it started between the ninth and twelfth months of the fourth year of Yuan祐. In fact, I used to hold the same view as Mr. Xu. On the fifth issue of the Chongqing edition of the Yishibao Shixue Fukan (Yishibao Historical Studies Supplement), published on May 30, 1940, I wrote an article titled "Postscript to A Chronological Biography of Shen Kuo." Regarding Shen Kuo's birth and death years, my conclusion was the same as Mr. Xu's now. I said:

"After Kuo's demotion in Yuanfeng, he was truly allowed to reside at his convenience in the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐. His move to Jingkou (i.e., Runzhou) should also be in this year. Counting eight years of living in Runzhou, he should have died in the fourth year of Shaosheng, and his year of birth was in the second year of Mingdao (1033-1097 AD). The deeds of Shen compiled by Zhang (Yinlin) are all one year earlier."

Not only is the conclusion the same, but the argument used is also the same, namely, the entry for the Wuxu day of the seventh month of the tenth year of Yuan祐 in volume 449 of the Changbian. I had shown that small article to Mr. Zhang, and Mr. Zhang had added a note to the article, expressing his agreement with my conclusion. Later, my opinion changed, and I also wrote to Mr. Zhang at Zhejiang University to inform him, and presented the arguments one by one. Mr. Zhang replied, also considering this new opinion to be reasonable. The recent article "A Study of Shen Kuo's Birth and Death Years" was written based on this revised opinion.

Why did I change to a new opinion? The various arguments used in "A Study of Shen Kuo's Birth and Death Years" can serve as an explanation, so I will not repeat them here. Regarding Mr. Xu's opinion, I would like to raise three points of doubt for discussion. According to the "Letter of Thanks for Being Appointed as a Secretary of Nanjing" in volume 16 of the Changxing Collection, "A messenger from Runzhou delivered an official notice," etc., seems to imply that Shen Kuo was already living in Runzhou at this time (before the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐). There is no shortage of coincidences, but if Shen Kuo did not live in Runzhou at this time, and the official notice was delivered by a messenger from Runzhou, and after Shen Kuo received it, he lived in Runzhou, wouldn't that be too much of a coincidence? This is the first point. If he was not in Runzhou at this time, but in Huangzhou, Huangzhou and Runzhou are far apart. Why didn't the government document directly send it to Huangzhou and have it sent by a messenger from Huangzhou, but instead sent a messenger from Runzhou from thousands of miles away? This is very puzzling. This is the second point. Mr. Xu said that Runzhou was "an important hub for water transportation at the time, and some documents used it as a starting point for transportation." I don't know if this statement has any basis? If other examples can be cited besides this one to prove that the Northern Song Dynasty did have a method of using Runzhou as a starting point for transporting documents, this conclusion may be valid. This is the third point.

I feel that the question of Shen Kuo's birth and death years is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion because the existing historical materials are limited and the wording is vague. Saying that he lived in Runzhou after the ninth month of the fourth year of Yuan祐 does not fully conform to the imperial edict of the Wuxu day of the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐. Saying that he did not live in Runzhou until after the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐, but the official notice was delivered by a messenger from Runzhou. Both views have difficulties. I am not satisfied with my opinion now, and I hope that Mr. Xu and those who study the history of the Song Dynasty can teach me. 36, 6, 9, Tsinghua Garden

### On Waste

— Ji Yong

In China, waste is necessary, which is very different from other countries. Americans value efficiency. Restaurants require "self-service," and ticket purchases on trams, food purchases in candy stores, and everything else that can be managed by a nickel or a dime to replace a living person, is mainly to save the strength of living people. They do not save manpower to eat, drink, play, and kill boring time, but have greater and more important work for people to do. But this does not work in China. China lacks machines, but has a surplus of manpower. Once manpower is replaced by machines, they will lose their jobs, to the point of hunger and cold, and further to rebellion and banditry. Therefore, when foreign devils wanted to build railways in China, the censor officials of the previous Qing Dynasty submitted memorials, believing that this would cause unemployment and create the root of chaos, something that should never be allowed. The Songhu Railway, built by the British in the early years of Tongzhi, was thus forced to stop, and the Chinese government redeemed it for more than 200,000 taels of silver and sank it in the bay.

Can you say this is stubborn? The Qing Dynasty really lost the country due to railway disputes. The Eight-Nation Alliance really marched triumphantly to Beijing along the Beijing-Tianjin Railway. Even before the July 7th Incident, the Beining Railway was still the main artery for Japanese troop transport. Such railways sometimes simply make people feel that "it is better to have none!" As for the civil wars during the warlord era, it goes without saying that the people along the railway line suffered completely. The railway is like this, and looking at the so-called government agencies, since the late Qing Dynasty, there has been talk of cutting redundancies, and it has been nearly a hundred years, but redundancies are still cut endlessly. Last winter, the Executive Yuan even allocated quotas, ordering various agencies to cut according to the quotas. In fact, this method should also be considered, because although there are not many talented people in China, there are quite a few mediocre people. These people have finally found a job in large and small agencies with great effort. Once they are cut, how many hungry and cold people will be added? - Even if some plan is realized one day, these "disaster officials" who only copy precedents will be useless. Therefore, many things cannot be suddenly reformed. Official documents cannot reduce several bends and stops. Drawing, requesting, drafting, and approving cannot reduce several "seals." Government agencies cannot order fewer newspapers to provide these people with boring pastimes, and at the same time, they cannot have more tea rooms for service and to fund official factions. As for the expenses of paper cigarettes, tea, etc., they are additional prosperity. If you really cut the Gordian knot and thoroughly reform, how many people do you think will be involved? This unrest is much greater than spending more government expenses each month or delaying public affairs for a certain amount of time. "Those who plan for the country must be cautious!" The ancients said, choose the lesser of two evils, so we might as well say that in Chinese society, doing things with waste is the first priority, and efficiency is a miscalculation. If you don't believe it, look, because the dance halls that specialize in wasting manpower and time have been knocked down, causing such a big dispute. Alas, how can waste be easily prohibited!

What is even worse is that people who do not advocate waste sometimes feel that it is very correct, at least it will not cause any harm to themselves, but there will be exceptions. Recently, reading "Liang Yansun's Chronicle," it is said that in the first year of Xuantong (1909), Yuan Shikai was dismissed because he disagreed with the Prince Regent, and the transport department officials were affected, including Chen Biwen, the minister of posts and communications:

"Soon, Censor Xie Yuanhan submitted a memorial

Impeaching Chen, the Minister of Posts and Communications, for many crimes, involving Mr. Liang and many members of the ministry (Mr. Liang refers to Liang Yansun, then the director of the Railway Administration), because he was instructed by a certain official in power, and also entrusted by those who were dissatisfied with the Ministry of Posts and Communications. At that time, a certain official in power wanted to overthrow Chen to isolate Yuan's power, and also to avenge a certain Duke who was the former director of the railway (referring to Sheng Xuanhuai). He was overjoyed and drafted an edict ordering Grand Scholar Sun Jia Nai Xiang to investigate. The two understood everything, and thoroughly checked the accounts, but found nothing wrong. They were about to truthfully report back, when Yuan Shikai was dismissed. Chen also lost the favor of Empress Dowager Yuta and the Prince Regent due to two matters: the Chongling project and the Prince Regent's residence [Original note: Minister Chen has been in charge of major projects and is known for his precision. Therefore, he was appointed as the Minister of the Chongling Project. According to custom, only about 30% of such major projects are completed, and the rest are used to bribe officials and distribute profits. Minister Chen consulted with the other two ministers of the same faction and estimated the amount of money. The two estimated 12 million taels, but Chen said that he could use 7 million taels if he did it himself. The two were silent, and then they dismissed the discussion. A few days later, an edict was issued: 'Chen does not need to be the Minister of the Chongling Project!' It was heard that someone had spread rumors, saying, 'The late emperor (Guangxu) suffered for a lifetime, and Chen Bi still wants to be stingy with him when he is buried!' Longyu (Guangxu's empress) heard this, and was heartbroken, and insisted on dismissing Chen. Just in time, the Prince Regent wanted to find a place to build a mansion, and someone deliberately told him that the location of the Ministry of Posts and Communications was excellent, but Minister Chen did not want to give it up. The Prince Regent was furious, and the two matters converged, and Sun and Nai could not avoid convicting Chen even if they wanted to! ] Because of the written charges, he was impeached. Minister Chen was handed over to the ministry for deliberation and was dismissed, and the members of the ministry were demoted or dismissed to varying degrees…"

Chen wanted not to waste, but as a result, he not only lost his official position, but his colleagues also suffered because of it. Isn't this a lesson from the past? From this we know that perhaps we usually scold officials for corruption, which may be a injustice. At least the motive is not entirely personal, but there must be a reason why "it must be so." Since this is the case, isn't waste efficiency in China, and isn't efficiency waste?

This is naturally a fallacy, please forgive me. (Editor's note: When the American hydraulic engineering expert Todd came to China to supervise the Yellow River embankment restoration project, I once asked him why he did not build a light railway to save time. Todd said sternly: For this kind of project, the more manpower wasted, the better. It is for the sake of providing work relief, and the more people who receive relief, the better. I was greatly moved by this, and Todd laughed at me.)

### Super Long Distance Call

The last International Transportation Conference was held in Moscow. After the meeting, a representative from an American telephone and telegraph company prepared to return home via Berlin. However, the Soviet plane that was to take him could only land in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, and that airfield was 25 miles from the American-occupied zone.

The American representative wanted to make a phone call to Berlin to request that the American side send a car to pick him up at the airfield, but the only telephone line at the Soviet airfield that could connect to Berlin was a military line.

However, as the saying goes, heaven never seals off all exits. Fortunately, the airfield did have long-distance telephone equipment connecting to the United States. Therefore, the American representative first made a phone call to the New York long-distance telephone station, and then the New York station made a long-distance call to the telephone company's person in charge in Berlin, asking him to send a car to the airfield. These several long-distance calls traveled back and forth a distance of nine thousand miles, creating a new record for a "calling-for-a-car phone call." (Ping)

### Spring Outing

— He Ku

"Reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles." The ancients have already said that going on an outing is better than merely reading books. Shanghai is a commercial city. From a purely profit-oriented perspective, traveling ten thousand miles can even more result in a rewarding harvest. During the war, many people did not hesitate to shoulder burdens and were willing to endure enemy stabs, insults, and scoldings, moving back and forth on the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line, engaging in the traveling profession - the "single-carrier" - precisely because traversing the roads could yield extremely high profits.

After the victory, even bigger "single-carriers" appeared, taking "Air Overlords" to Beiping, merchant ships of the China Merchants Bureau to Taiwan, or hitching rides on President-class postal ships to Hong Kong. In addition to daily expenses being covered without spending a penny, they could also earn a substantial profit. Although this kind of "business" is not something ordinary people can do, at least one must have some background or "skill" to act appropriately. This sufficiently illustrates that traveling ten thousand miles today is a productive endeavor, quite different from the era of Xu Xiake.

However, this method of traveling ten thousand miles has too much of a utilitarian mindset, losing the true meaning of an outing, and is not within the scope of the spring outing discussed in this article. Our ideal spring outing should be the realm of "five or six adults with caps, six or seven children, bathing in the Yi River, enjoying the breeze on the dance altar, and returning singing." As for whether the spring clothes are ready or not, that need not be considered. In fact, frequent travelers do not wear military uniforms, let alone the fact that making a set of spring clothes now costs too much. Making spring clothes for the sake of going on an outing is even more than what we can afford. Some friends are already starting to tailor summer gabardine suits for themselves, buying materials and tailoring. A summer suit costs more than fifteen million yuan, which is terrifying to hear. Moreover, according to their plans, our spring clothes should have been planned last fall. Since we did not plan in advance, it is better to be content with what we have. Even if it's just a set of old clothes, we can sit anywhere, whether on a mound, by a rock crevice, or by a lake shore. If it's brand new clothes, it will only burden you, making you a slave to clothing, which is hardly worthwhile.

The second condition for a spring outing is to have good weather. On the day we decide to go out, we may feel that rain doesn't matter because we are in good spirits, but rain is ultimately a spoilsport. From my own experience, once I went to Hangzhou, the weather was very good on the first and second days. The bright sunshine shone on the nearby water and distant mountains, creating a joyous atmosphere. On the third day, it was gloomy and rainy. Only four of us tourists were left climbing Baochu Pagoda, and we couldn't help but feel a gloomy loneliness. Looking at the lake view from afar, it was covered in fog, like looking at a street scene through frosted glass. You can probably imagine how unpleasant it was. Because most tourists like bright colors, the scenery in the countryside is sure to be bright and picturesque on warm and sunny days.

The first time I visited Hangzhou was during my school days. To cover the expenses, I first wrote a letter to ask for my father's consent. My father replied with absolute agreement, and at the end of the letter, he mentioned that he himself "hated being stuck at home every year, failing to appreciate this wonderful spring scenery." Now it is my turn to be stuck at home every year, so every year's wonderful spring scenery is "hated." Therefore, the most important, though not the least, condition for spring outings is having free time. There are many opportunities for travel nowadays, and travel groups are springing up everywhere, but a "whirlwind tour" of only one or two days is not a true spring outing. No one in the world uses the money for buying rice and vegetables to travel. Therefore, taking advantage of one's free time to go on an outing is also an extremely difficult thing. This makes us believe that a person must have some "good fortune" to be able to talk about spring outings. And one must also find a partner who is equally fortunate as you. Having a confidant in life and traveling to beautiful mountains and rivers is an ideal state, but it is probably difficult to find even one couple among thousands of people!

Writing this far, I truly feel that talking about spring outings at this time and place is not only a difficult thing, but also a luxury. The more I think about it, the more difficult it becomes, so I have no choice but to stop writing.

### Aiding the Hidden Poor

— Zhang Jiaoxin

Chen Hao, a staff member of the Municipal Finance Bureau, committed suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River because his wife had been ill for two months and he had exhausted his resources to treat her, but he could not bear to sit idly by. The Finance Bureau's colleagues, moved by compassion, launched a fundraising campaign to treat Mrs. Chen. This is a manifestation of human mutual assistance. Mencius said, "Supporting each other in sickness," which is the duty that a community should fulfill.

Under the circumstances of soaring prices and high living pressure, the vast majority of the impoverished masses truly feel that it is difficult to seek death and even more difficult to make a living! Ordinary laborers can still wear short clothes and rely on their physical strength to support their families, but those friends who wear long clothes only know how to wield a pen. They cannot carry loads or lift heavy objects. They have no physical strength to sell, and they are too embarrassed to take off the long clothes that represent gentility. They usually struggle and groan under the heavy pressure of life. Once they encounter illness, they find it difficult to beg for help or borrow from others for fear of being met with disdain. In this situation, death is the only way out. The ruthless whip of life drives them to the path of suicide! The most pitiful and unspeakable people in the world are this group of "hidden poor"!

After Mr. Chen's suicide, the Finance Bureau's colleagues raised funds to help, which is commendable! However, it is best to provide assistance before such tragedies occur, so as to eliminate them in their infancy. My suggestion is: within an organization or among relatives and friends, if there are such hidden poor, it may be worthwhile for enthusiastic people to initiate a gathering. For example, if two or three million yuan can be collected, it can be used to generate interest. In about four or five months, the principal and interest will be equal. Then, half of it can be returned to the helpers, and half can be loaned out. A portion or a large portion of the monthly interest can be withdrawn to supplement the lack of living expenses. In this way, the recipient can feel at ease after four or five months, having paid off the debt, and the helpers will only lose four or five months of interest, which is a limited loss. Under the belief that "it is most joyful to do good," it does not seem to be a difficult thing.

If you say that there are too many poor people now, and it is unlikely that anyone can help others, that is indeed true. However, the fundraising document of the Finance Bureau's colleagues states, "...Although we are as poor as Mr. Chen, we are still struggling and can still struggle. We should offer sympathy in spirit and assistance in material terms. The amount of money doesn't have to be much. Please do what you can..." They are originally asking everyone to "do what you can." If we can help one more person, society will have one more point of stability. Although it is called helping others, why isn't it helping oneself?

### Anhydrous Food

— Xili

According to experts, since mankind learned to dry fruits and other things in the sun for storage, there is now a new type of food about to appear. This new product is called "Anhydrous Food". Anhydrous fruits and vegetables can retain the color, fragrance, taste, and vitamins they had when fresh. Because its water content is completely absorbed, the "bulk" of "Anhydrous Food" can all fit into a container the size of two cigarette boxes.

Housewives can put all the vegetables and fruits they need for a week into their handbags when they go shopping. For example, a small bag of rice-sized anhydrous potatoes, about the size of two decks of cards, can feed five people. Moreover, we can now enjoy seasonal fresh fruits all year round, because "Anhydrous Food" does not need to be refrigerated at normal temperatures and can be kept from spoiling for up to a year.

Another benefit of "Anhydrous Food" for housewives is that it eliminates the hassle of going to the market. A year's worth of food can be purchased all at once and stored in a medium-sized storage room. Cooking time can also be greatly reduced. "Anhydrous Food" does not need to be peeled or washed, and there are no scraps to throw away, because the pits and peels have all been removed during manufacturing.

Clarence Birdseye, the first person to invent quick-freezing, is the inventor of this new type of food. He recently unveiled his new contribution at a banquet in New York. Many of the experts present thought he had made a new discovery about quick-freezing. Little did they know that they were invited to eat his newly invented food. When everyone asked him how he made it, Birdseye and H. W. Roden, the manager of the American Home Foods Corporation, which produces this new product, gave a detailed explanation.

Birdseye used only a wok, a frying pan, and a little water to cook carrots and cauliflower in ten minutes. Then he poured a bag of anhydrous sweet potatoes onto a steamer, sprinkled it with water, and stirred it for a while, and the dish was ready. It only took four minutes from pouring out of the bag to completion.

Birdseye said he had successfully dehydrated spinach, onions, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and almost all common vegetables and fruits. He believes that there is nothing that cannot be dehydrated.

The previous type of dehydrated food took longer to prepare than fresh food, because it had to be soaked in water for a long time before it could be cooked. The usual cooking time was one and a half hours. As for the new product, it only takes four to ten minutes. The previous food took about eighteen hours to dehydrate, while the new dehydrator can remove more water in one and a half hours.

"Without adding high heat, and with the water being removed so quickly, the food simply doesn't have time to change its properties," Birdseye said. "Because the water is removed quickly, it also rehydrates quickly. So when cooking, most of the nutrients, color, flavor, and taste are preserved."

Another advantage of dehydrated food is that it is easy to store and takes up very little space. The raw materials loaded onto nine trucks can be reduced to five trucks of old-fashioned dried fruit after dehydration. If it is further dehydrated into the new product mentioned in this article, then only one truck will be needed to load it all.

### Sea Red House Poetry Collection

— Xu Banmeng

Dream

Old dreams of the Guangxu and Xuantong eras are to be relived, old broken duckweed traces no longer exist, poetry is hard to write with so much to see, Buddha is audacious to claim eminence in the void. Plum blossoms in a pot exude pure fragrance in my seat, moonlight in the woods dims, snow fills the door, I laugh at my accustomed decadence, passing the day and night in utter boredom.

Feeling

Who built the Golden Terrace of King Zhao, seeking worthy men to rise up as talents, the great land and rivers are to be restored, the long sky filled with wind and rain. My heart follows the wild geese across a thousand broken mountains, my dreams chase the crying apes in myriad laments. I do not believe there are nameless men by the vast sea, a single hammer at Bolang unexpectedly causing thunder.

Sitting Quietly

Sitting quietly in an empty hall, forgetting all thoughts, leisurely facing each other, talking about sorrow and desolation, although the setting sun is beautiful, dusk is near, bright and sharp youth is merciless, white hair is gray. Facing this vastness, a hundred feelings arise, because people are busy for a thousand fields. The spiritual brush has a transcendental place, cleanse the roots and tease the old hometown.

Upstream

Wanting to turn heaven and earth into flying pavilions, the water stirs the clouds, connecting to heal upstream, ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers unfold like brocade, gales from all directions, dragons stir. Eastern scales and Western claws gathered to form a battle array, Northern darkness and Southern boats, the moon serves as a fishing weir, looking back at the layered city, leaning in the distant, pupils viewing the dawn sun below the yellow bull.

Feeling the Times

Heroes boast of carving up territory, fortune fills long banners, in chaotic times, years are forgotten, in poverty, people disregard life and death. The Central Plains is still suffering from war, the outer seas have not ceased fighting. To whom does Heaven's will belong? The remaining chess pieces are still battling.

Coldness fills the Lan River, solitary chanting is gladdened by a friend's passing, tears fall from thinking of my younger brother, dreams are filled with thoughts of home. Chaos lingers, still with beacon fires, this year, I still whistle and sing. A round moon before the window, is illuminating the night.

### Humble Suggestions for Beautifying Zhongzheng Park

— Liu Rong

Shanghai, as an international metropolis, is frequented by both Chinese and foreigners. All municipal facilities should naturally adhere to modernization as a standard. Not only should public utilities such as transportation, water, electricity, medicine, and hygiene be complete and free from concerns of inadequacy, but also places that cultivate noble sentiments in citizens and nurture excellent character in the public, such as parks, should especially be beautified to possess the tranquility of urban mountains and forests. Thus, citizens bustling and striving for fame and gain in life may have a chance to step into the gardens, wash away the dust and vulgarity, clarify their minds, and restore their inherent goodness. Since arriving in Shanghai, I have visited all the parks in the past two years. Although each has its own style, I feel that their layout and management have not fully met the ideal. Now, I will focus on Zhongzheng Park, which is the closest to my residence, the most frequently visited, the most familiar, and the most deeply felt.

Zhongzheng Park is located in Hongkou, with spacious grounds and a quiet environment. It is a pity that the park's layout is very simple, with everything visible at a glance, lacking the charm of a garden. In the park, apart from a few flower beds of miscellaneous plants in the square at the entrance (even these are currently missing), there is a straw pavilion in the left corner of the park, and a monument to the war dead of the Songhu-Hangzhou battle in the north corner of the park. In addition, there are only two half-acre ponds, one clear enough to reflect people, one planted with lotus roots, where one can see the wind on the water surface and smell the fragrance of lotus flowers in the height of summer. But when the spring breeze first stirs and new green has not yet emerged, the park is filled with a view of nothing but withered grass and weeds, which evokes only sorrow and sighs, let alone cultivating emotions and nurturing character. Can this be called a park? Can this be called recreation? The park lacks peach and plum blossoms in spring, pomegranate and palm trees in summer (fortunately, there are water caltrops and lotus, which are barely satisfactory), osmanthus and chrysanthemums in autumn, and plum and bamboo in winter. The scenery of the four seasons is incomplete, and there are no pavilions or buildings. It lacks the charm of winding paths leading to secluded spots and is short of lush flowers and trees. It has no shade in summer and no veranda in winter. It truly lacks everything and has nothing. To build a park out of stone, one can invite clouds, plant bananas to invite rain, plant bamboos to invite wind, strike the pond to ward off the moon, plant flowers to invite butterflies... Turning the ordinary into the magical depends on the ingenuity of the designer. Now the park is barren, like a leper with a bald head, like Xishi with a soiled body. It is truly a pity!

In modern times, with the development of science, horticulture has become a specialized discipline, and flowers and landscaping are among its specialized subjects. Given the size of our country and the recent promotion of agriculture, the establishment of agricultural vocational schools and the dispatch of personnel to the United States for internships, there is no shortage of landscaping talents. Why not employ them to beautify this park, which is related to the welfare of more than four million citizens? Wouldn't that be great?

Someone may say: This problem is not necessarily that simple. Every municipal construction project inevitably involves the issue of funding. This is not necessarily the case. The municipal budget already includes an item for park management expenses, and the proportion of expenses required is actually minimal. I do not know what the current organization of park management is and what the source of funding is. But seeing that there are people collecting tickets at the park entrance and that there are people living in the park, it is probably not entirely a matter of neglect. And seeing that there is no layout or facilities in the park, leaving it to be overgrown with weeds, it seems that no one is responsible for it. Is it not an easy thing to plant a tree in the spring and a flower in the autumn? Does it also require expense limitations? Now, try stepping into the park, how many trees are there? Is there a flower? I truly cannot understand it. Is it really the case that "everyone neglects the public water buffalo"? Does everything involving "public" and "government" have to be a mess? How sad! In the past, when Zeng Guofan restored Jinling, he did not forget to rebuild the Qinhuai River. And Zheng Banqiao lamented over "a scene of joy, overgrown with weeds." He believed that it was related to the rise and fall of the country throughout the ages. Seeing the subtle and knowing the obvious, it can truly verify the prosperity or decline of the country. Moreover, this park is a place to "guide the people with righteousness," and its significance is even more profound!

Spring returns to the earth, and everything is reviving. It is the time to plant trees and flowers. Having seen this, I hereby draft this article to urge the relevant authorities and people in society to pay attention, and also to represent the voice of a part of the citizens. As for how to build a beautiful, complete, and ideal park, that is the business of experts. Those who are in charge should not overstep their bounds.

### Dream

— Tian Zibing

Dreams are like mysterious messengers, weaving the remnants of daily life into beautiful stories, as beautiful as poetry. They often give people many strange imaginings, pain and joy. Dreams and art are most closely related.

Many artistic creations are often related to dreams. In Xu Ci, it is said that Qin Guan's "Good Deeds Near" was composed in a dream. Yuan Zhen's "Liangzhou Dream," Lu You's "Night Tour Palace," and Liu Kezhuang's "Qinyuan Spring" were all written to record dreams. Millet often took the scenes he felt during the day, meditated on them in the evening, and produced good paintings the next day. The musician Tartini's "Devil's Trill Sonata" was based on a melody the devil played to him in a dream. Goethe also said that in a dream, one could dream of the lives of the characters in the works one thought of during the day. It is said that Shi Xiu painted the portraits of the Sixteen Arhats after having a dream every night and then painting it when he woke up. (This picture is in the Holy Cause Temple in West Lake, now the West Lake Museum.)

When we appreciate a good work of art, our minds often wander and merge with the art. Life is indeed like a dream, but today, with so much devastation, so many beautiful dreams have been shattered, and so many life's blueprints have been stained.

### Xiaoyao Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Full of Doubts (Eight and Nine)

As soon as Zhongjie heard that it was Qiyun's brother, he thought that with her brother on the scene, it would be difficult to explain if he resorted to violence again. He blurted out: "You ganged up to deceive me! I'm giving you a deadline to leave this place today. If you don't leave, I'll send people to catch you. Be careful!" With that, he put his gun in his pocket and stormed downstairs. Qiyun was originally prepared to sacrifice herself and fight Zhongjie, but as soon as Zhongjie left, her courage flagged. Facing Xiaohe, she felt very ashamed and couldn't say a word. She turned and ran to the bed, crying loudly. Xiaohe walked over and said: "Sister, you're too inexperienced! How could you associate with this kind of person! This kind of person has ruined so many people. Now everyone knows about it. How can I face my friends? Qiyun, seeing that Xiaohe was also blaming her, felt very wronged and couldn't explain herself for a moment. She just sobbed and cried. Xiaohe took out a newspaper from his arms and said: "Have you seen the news in today's paper?" Qiyun said: "Don't mention it! I know everything. I didn't expect this kind of person to be so unreasonable. I admit I'm unlucky. There's nothing to say. You don't need to nag me anymore!" Xiaohe said: "I'm not meddling. According to what's published in today's paper, it really has a lot to do with our reputation. You have to pay attention. Our father was very particular about family status. Now that this has happened, how can we face our dead father? You're too willful in everything. You think you can control everyone with your temper. You've been taken advantage of today. If I hadn't come in, you might have lost your life!" Qiyun said: "I didn't want you to come in. I'd rather die. What's the point of living?" Xiaohe said: "Sister, even if you die, your reputation will be ruined. I won't be able to face anyone either." Qiyun said: "You don't have to worry about me. Even if I die, I won't burden you." Saying that, she cried loudly. Xiaohe, seeing that his persuasion was not working, stomped his feet and said: "Too willful! Too willful!" Saying that, he walked away angrily. Qiyun cried for a while in the room. Little Wang Ma tried to persuade her several times, but she just ignored her. Little Wang Ma was so anxious that she called Zhuzhai, but Zhuzhai was not in the dormitory. No one came to comfort her. Qiyun cried for a long time, and the more she thought about it, the angrier she became. She felt that she had suffered a great loss today and that she was too wronged. It was no wonder that Zhuzhai didn't understand her. Even her brother came to blame her. Now that the newspaper has published it, the whole city is talking about it, and everyone knows about it. How can she face her colleagues? Chief Miao is also forcing her to leave. If she doesn't leave Beiping, who knows what kind of trouble he will cause. This time, she has completely sacrificed herself for the sake of Zhuzhai. There is nothing to say. Since things have come to this, death is the cleanest solution. Immediately, she took off the ring on her left hand and stuffed it into her mouth. Just at this moment, Little Wang Ma brought in the hot water and saw that Qiyun seemed to have something stuffed in her mouth. She rushed over and shouted: "Boss, what did you swallow?" Qiyun shook her head and frowned, walking towards the bed to lie down. Little Wang Ma followed closely and saw that the ring was gone from Qiyun's finger. She shouted: "Boss! What did you swallow? Where's the ring on your hand?" Qiyun said: "It's none of your business!" Little Wang Ma saw that her expression was not right and panicked. She quickly called Qiyun's brother, Xiaohe, and said: "Master, come quickly! The boss swallowed the ring!" Xiaohe was also flustered and rushed over. He saw Qiyun lying on the bed, frowning tightly. He asked her what was wrong, but she just kept her mouth shut. Xiaohe said: "Sister, why are you doing such a foolish thing? This kind of action is too unwise!" Qiyun just frowned and ignored Xiaohe no matter how he asked her. Xiaohe saw that she didn't answer and frowned, knowing that something was wrong. He quickly called Dr. Zhu Zuwen. Dr. Zhu was originally a theater fan and usually hung out with Xiaohe. In his spare time, he often sang and played instruments at Xiaohe's house to pass the time. This evening, he received Xiaohe's call and heard that the situation was urgent. He rushed over and, after examining her, felt that it was necessary to give her an enema in the hospital. Qiyun initially insisted on refusing, but unable to withstand everyone's persuasion, she was involuntarily sent to the West Something Hospital for treatment. (The End)
