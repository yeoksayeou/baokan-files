### Chairman Visits National Assembly Hall, Listens to Entire Foreign Affairs Report, Wang Shijie Explains the Situation is Extremely Grave

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] Chairman Chiang visited the National Assembly Hall this morning for a short period of about one hour. The Chairman, dressed in military fatigues, arrived five minutes before the meeting started, sat in the presiding officer's seat, and left through a side door after listening to the foreign affairs report and a portion of the domestic affairs report. The time was 10:35 AM, and he was in the meeting hall for a total of one hour and fifteen minutes.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] The eighth session of the National Assembly was held at 9:25 AM on the fourteenth morning. 1587 representatives attended. The third group of the presidium was on duty, presided over by Chairman Chen Guang, who announced the opening of the meeting. After the secretariat presented a report, the day's agenda began with political reports. The ministers of foreign affairs, domestic affairs, education, and social affairs successively reported on the general situation of their administration. The meeting adjourned at 12:20 PM.

Minister Wang Shijie first reported on foreign affairs, specifically citing five points, which he explained separately:

First, World Peace and Our Country's Attitude: Wang stated, "The current situation is extremely grave. More than two years have passed since the end of World War II, but the victorious nations have yet to establish a common policy toward Germany and Japan, and thus a peace treaty with Germany and Japan has not been established. Therefore, China must continue to strive to promote the realization of all plans to strengthen the United Nations' power. Our position is: (1) to restrict the abuse of the veto power, (2) to promptly establish an international armed force in accordance with the United Nations Charter."

Second, Sino-American Relations: After the end of the war against Japan, the United States provided us with two major forms of assistance, namely assisting our government in sending two to three million Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese residents back to Japan, and assisting in transporting a large number of National Army troops to the Northeast and North China to carry out the reception work. As for our government's policy toward the United States, it is still to maintain and enhance the traditional friendship and cooperation between the two countries. The recent US loan to China aims to help our economy get on the road to stability. I will use it to offset the insufficiency of international payments and recover the legal tender, reduce issuance and help production.

Third, Sino-Soviet Relations and Others: China, based on the fact that the Sino-Soviet border is adjacent for thousands of kilometers, must be able to maintain a permanent peaceful and friendly relationship, and therefore concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. If it can be strictly implemented, China and the Soviet Union will surely be able to coexist in a friendly and peaceful manner.

Fourth, the Japan issue: Our country advocates severity in military matters and allowing the Japanese to achieve self-sufficiency in economic matters, in order to support a new, democratic Japan. At the time of the conclusion of the peace treaty, China will firmly advocate the establishment of a control mechanism.

Fifth, Protection of Overseas Chinese: The most basic task is to negotiate with various countries to conclude new treaties, so that overseas Chinese can receive equal treatment with other foreign residents under the new treaties.

Zhang Lisheng Reports on Domestic Affairs, Will Pay Special Attention to Local Autonomy Affairs in the Future

Minister Zhang Lisheng reported on domestic affairs, briefly explaining three points: one is the general situation of local autonomy work, one is the handling of various elections, and one is the protection of the basic rights of the people. Zhang first stated: "Since the closing of the National Assembly, the focus of domestic affairs work has been on preparing for constitutional governance. Regarding the issue of local autonomy, because all regions suffered greatly during the eight-year war of resistance, and some areas were limited by military suppression of bandits, it was not possible to promote it universally. However, it is estimated that the establishment of local public opinion organizations in various counties, townships, and towns has reached 80% of the total, and due to the supervision of public opinion organizations, considerable achievements have also been made in the governance of local affairs. In the future, special attention will be paid to local autonomy undertakings such as education, health, household registration, and land registration." Zhang then described the process of handling the election, and after reporting on the election process of supervisors and national representatives, he specially declared to the assembly his inescapable responsibility. He emphasized that "the biggest mistake I made in handling election affairs this time was overemphasizing the current cooperative relationship between parties, which caused some difficulties and unexpected troubles. I should bear this responsibility and do not expect forgiveness." When Zhang reported this point, he received some warm applause. The third is the protection of the basic rights of the people. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the Publication Law has been revised, and censorship of newspapers has been abolished. As for the issue of personal freedom, it belongs to the Police Headquarters. At present, police administration cannot be handled as perfectly as ideal, but in the future, according to the provisions of the Constitution, the people will obtain the rights they deserve, and it is hoped that representatives will return to their hometowns to guide the people in implementing the central government's policies and orders, work together to suppress the rebellion, and expect nation-building to be successful.

Education Report

When Zhu Jiahua reported on education, he first described some measures taken during the war, which were changed after the victory because they did not meet the needs of the environment. The education rehabilitation work was completed by the end of the 35th year according to the decision of the Education Rehabilitation Conference, but the rehabilitation fee was too small, and the handling was quite difficult. Zhu then reported on several important issues: (1) The number of schools and students has increased significantly after the war compared to before the war, but the number of students in elementary education has decreased due to the occupation and rebellion of the communist bandits. However, in terms of quality, there has been no progress, but it has declined due to the lack of teachers. (2) Basic education should be popularized as much as possible. In the first half of this year, 800 billion yuan was used to subsidize provinces and cities to handle basic education, which is being carefully allocated to make it fair and reasonable in order to achieve results. (3) Educational funding is tight. In the first half of this year, it accounted for 12% of the budget, more than half of which was used for student meals and teachers' salaries. Teachers' salaries are listed alongside civil servants, and the Ministry of Education can only care about them. (4) The Relief Committee for Unemployed and Out-of-School Youth will continue to handle the relief of unemployed and out-of-school youth, and it is hoped that the provinces and cities will handle it themselves in the future, with the central government coordinating funding. (5) Recently, the academic atmosphere has been sluggish for many reasons, which is unavoidable. However, the biggest problem is the incitement of the Communist Party. The Ministry of Education pays close attention to this and will never condone it. It is also hoped that representatives and social forces will assist in reversing the decline.

Social Report

Gu Zhenggang's social report is divided into three sections: (1) Refugee Relief: After Gu reported on the guiding principles, methods, and implementation situation, he pointed out that the relief funds allocated by the government could not be described as a drop in the bucket, but rather as a goose feather from a thousand miles away. In the future, improvements will focus on increasing sources of relief funds. In addition to hoping for assistance from friendly countries, special attention will be paid to soliciting donations for special relief. (2) Labor Situation: Gu stated that the Ministry of Social Affairs is implementing leadership in three areas: improving the lives of workers, eliminating labor-management disputes, and supporting workers' participation in politics. There are currently 5 million organized workers, and they are the greatest force in combating the Communist Party. (3) Supporting the development of vocational groups: Based on the spirit of freedom and democracy in the Constitution, the Ministry of Social Affairs has revised various laws and regulations, strengthened the grassroots organizations of various groups, and guided the establishment of national organizations and enriched them. There has been progress in recent years. In terms of numbers, there are currently 7,171 vocational groups nationwide, with 11,6309 group members and 28,378,004 individual members, and their leaders are all professionals in their respective fields.

### Presidium Meeting

Today's Agenda Submitted to the Assembly for Research

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] The National Assembly Presidium held a meeting at 8 PM on the fourteenth. Chairman Pan Gongzhan reported on the process of receiving petitioners from Anhui students of major and secondary schools, and decided to send it to the National Government for handling. Then, they began discussions and decided that the chairman of the ninth session of the assembly on the fifteenth would be He Chengjun in the morning and Zhu Jiahua in the afternoon. The conveners of the seven review committees were also designated by the presidium, with five to nine people in each group, and submitted to the assembly for decision. Regarding the agenda of the assembly on the fifteenth, because some representatives requested to continue the political and economic review, the meeting discussed it for a long time and did not reach a conclusion. Because the Executive Yuan will hold a meeting on the fifteenth, if the political and economic review continues, it will be difficult for the heads of the various ministries of the Executive Yuan to attend the assembly to listen. If the constitutional amendment is discussed according to the original agenda, it is feared that the representatives will oppose it. Finally, it was decided to submit it to the assembly for research on the fifteenth. If the review is not continued in the morning, the constitutional amendment will be discussed, and the review will be held in the afternoon.

### Government Prepares to Authorize Security Agencies to Adopt Measures to Stop Riots to Ensure Social Order and the People's Lives and Property

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] Military News Agency Dispatch: According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense: The Communist bandits control their occupied areas with severe punishments, using terror and massacre to coerce the people to participate in the rebellion, while taking advantage of the free environment in the government area to organize underground work, engage in espionage activities, and develop various riotous behaviors through strikes, work stoppages, parades, and demonstrations, responding to their wandering and expanding their rebellious behavior. Based on the reports of surrendered bandits regarding the above situation, the government, in order to ensure social order and the lives and property of the people, will, when necessary, authorize local garrison, police, security, and other security agencies to adopt measures to stop riots in accordance with the law.

### Review of Politics and Economy, Most Speakers Criticize the Government's Improper Administration, Xinjiang and Mongolian Representatives Demand Attention to Border Administration

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] The eighth session of the National Assembly continued at 3:40 PM on the fourteenth. 1541 representatives attended. The fourth group of the presidium was on duty, presided over by Chairman Chen Lianfen, who announced the opening of the meeting. After the announcement, a review of politics and economy was conducted. The chairman first proposed that because there were so many people requesting to speak, could each unit send one or two representatives to speak in order to expedite the meeting? However, after representatives raised objections, speeches were still given individually in the order of the speech slips. By 6 PM, a total of 15 people had spoken. Except for one representative from Taiwan Province, the rest were all representatives from the north, and four representatives from Xinjiang and Mongolia spoke. What was particularly notable today was that a farmer representative from Shanxi also spoke. By the statutory adjournment time of 6 PM, there were still more than 300 people requesting to speak. Although the chairman announced that the unfinished agenda for today's review would be continued on the morning of the 18th, the representatives from the north were emotionally agitated and did not want the agenda to be interrupted, which caused some commotion in the meeting hall.

In today's speeches, most representatives criticized the current government's improper administration, especially the border representatives who repeatedly criticized the government's neglect of the border. Mongolian representative Duoduo Bo stated: "In the government's administrative reports heard in recent days, not a single word was mentioned about Mongolia, and the Mongolian autonomy plan has been drafted, but the government has violated the provisions of the Constitution and has not completed the legislative procedures." Zaqisqin said: "The government has opened the door, and the Mongolians will definitely come in. The government's failure to subsidize Mongolian funding and the lack of political openness are extremely unreasonable." Xinjiang representative Mutiyi said: "Our compatriots in Xinjiang are all proud to be citizens of the Republic of China, but the government neglects the border so much, and the government is based on people, and changes one person and changes one method. In this way, the Xinjiang problem cannot be solved. I hope the central government will formulate a permanent border ethnic policy, with rights and obligations stipulated one by one, and the government and the people will abide by it." Tu Legan hoped that the government could establish a border ministry to specifically manage various issues such as border education and culture. Representatives from the Northeast unanimously criticized the economic problems, namely the circulation voucher problem, satirizing Zhang Jiaao's measures during his tenure as chairman of the Northeast Economic Commission as "virtuous governance", and demanding that Zhang Jiaao attend the meeting to report and answer questions. They also stated that "the people of the Northeast do not want anything special. We are all Chinese." Yang Zhiping from Liaobei hoped that the government would welcome public criticism, acknowledge criticism, and be brave in correcting mistakes. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.

### Shanxi Farmer Representative Speaks for the First Time, Meeting Hall Applauds Warmly

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] He Min, the Shanxi representative elected as a farmer, spoke at the eighth session of the National Assembly on the afternoon of the fourteenth. This was the first time a farmer had spoken at the meeting. He was dressed simply, wearing a set of Chinese-style jacket and trousers. His speech was also extremely simple. He said, "I am a farmer representative. I don't know how to speak. No one has ever spoken for us farmers. No one knows our farmers' pain. I only know that we farmers don't even have seeds for planting. I really can't take it anymore." After speaking, he bowed and stepped down from the stage. Before and after He Min stepped onto the stage, all the representatives gave him long and enthusiastic applause.

### Zeng Qi Publishes Comparative Table, Believes the Constitution Should Not Be Amended

[Central News Agency Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] The National Assembly Presidium has included the issue of amending the Constitution on the agenda for the fifteenth, which is one of the most important issues since the opening of the National Assembly. Zeng Qi, the leader of the Chinese Youth Party, recently published his handwritten "Comparative Table of the Advantages and Disadvantages of Maintaining the Constitution and Amending the Constitution." The original table is as follows: (A) Advantages of Maintaining the Constitution: (1) It can show the determination to implement constitutional governance, (2) It can demonstrate great credibility to the world, (3) It can protect the positions of the three parties, (4) It can block the mouths of the Communist Party. (B) Disadvantages of Amending the Constitution: (1) Amending it before it is implemented is inexplicable, (2) The articles are complicated and easily lead to disputes, (3) Past efforts will be misunderstood, (4) Changing from plaintiff to defendant gives the Communist bandits an excuse and causes doubts at home and abroad.

### Taiwan Representatives Propose Recalling Ryukyu

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] All 29 representatives from Taiwan have submitted a proposal to the National Assembly requesting the government to recall Ryukyu. The contents of the proposal will be released to reporters in the coming days.

### Mo Dehui et al. Propose the Enactment of Provisional Regulations, Giving the President Emergency Powers, So That He Can Adapt to the Times During the Period of Rebellion Suppression. Proposals Related to Constitutional Amendments Were Closed Yesterday Afternoon

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] During the period of rebellion suppression, in order to ensure that all government measures are effectively responsible in order to adapt to the times, National Representative Mo Dehui and 721 others specifically proposed the "Enactment of Provisional Regulations During the Period of Mobilization for Rebellion Suppression." The content of the draft regulations is as follows:

Now, in accordance with the procedures of Article 174, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, the Provisional Regulations During the Period of Mobilization for Rebellion Suppression are hereby enacted as follows:

During the period of mobilization for rebellion suppression, the President, in order to avoid national or people's emergency distress or to cope with major financial and economic changes, may, after the resolution of the Executive Yuan, take emergency measures, without being restricted by the procedures stipulated in Article 39 or Article 43 of the Constitution. The Legislative Yuan may change or cancel the aforementioned emergency measures in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 57, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution. The termination of the period of mobilization for rebellion suppression shall be announced by the President or by the Legislative Yuan requesting the President to announce it. In addition, National Representative Zhang Zhiben and others, in view of the fact that the Constitution only stipulates the President's authority to issue emergency orders in the event of natural disasters, epidemics, or national emergencies, if internal disturbances occur, even if there is a need for rapid disposition due to the mobilization for rebellion suppression, this order may not be issued, which is not sufficient to meet the country's emergency needs. They specifically proposed that "the assembly resolve that the President may issue emergency orders due to mobilization for rebellion suppression in order to meet the needs of the country." The content also stated that the order must be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for ratification within two months after its issuance.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] The deadline for receiving proposals related to constitutional amendments in the National Assembly was noon on the fourteenth. Seventeen proposals have been submitted.

### Hundreds of Anhui Students Petition the National Assembly, Demanding the Replacement of Li Pinxian

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] Hundreds of Anhui students from major and secondary schools in Nanjing demanded that the government replace Anhui Chairman Li Pinxian. This afternoon, they went to the National Assembly to petition. The presidium appointed representatives Pan Gongzhan, Gu Yuxiu, and Sun Yafu to receive them. Pan stated that he would convey the students' opinions to the presidium and send the opinion letter to the representatives. The students began to leave in formation at about 6 PM, still chanting slogans along the way to overthrow Li Pinxian.

### Chairman's Letter to the US President, McNutt Has Presented it to the White House, Truman Reports to Congress on Our Food Rationing Situation

[Central News Agency Washington Thirteenth Dispatch] McNutt, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the United China Relief Association, who recently returned to the United States from China, met with President Truman today and presented letters from Chairman Chiang and Philippine President Roxas. Reporters waiting at the White House asked McNutt what he discussed with the President and the contents of the two letters. McNutt declined to answer.

[US Information Service Washington Thirteenth Dispatch] President Truman stated in a report to Congress today: China's first complete food rationing plan is now being supported by American relief supplies under a plan jointly managed by Chinese and American officials. The plan was implemented on March 1 in five major metropolitan centers including Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. Specific plans were drawn up in advance to properly store American relief supplies and then distribute them monthly at fixed prices, so that people at all levels could benefit. The approval of additional funding for China under the Foreign Aid Act signed by President Truman on April 3 is expected to guarantee the continued flow of relief supplies to China.

[Associated Press Washington Thirteenth Dispatch] President Truman submitted a report to Congress on the thirteenth, reporting on the progress of foreign aid up to the end of 1947, stating that all supplies purchased for China under the Relief Act after the UNRRA concluded in May last year and the Interim Relief Act in December last year will arrive in China in the early summer of 1948.

### National Army in Zhengzhou Launches Full-Scale Offensive, Sweeping the Periphery Horizontally and Vertically. Order in the City is Quickly Restored. Communist Bandits on the Pinghan Railway Continue to Flee Westward

[Central News Agency Kaifeng Fourteenth Dispatch] The elite National Army and rapid units in Zhengzhou launched a full-scale offensive today, sweeping away the remaining bandits in the periphery horizontally and vertically. Order in the city has been quickly restored. There are no more traces of bandits in the entire territory of Guangwu. There are also only a few scattered bandits active between Rongyang and Fanshui and in Meishan and Qinshan, 40 miles southwest of Zhengzhou, and they will be cleared up within days. The main force of the bandit army is currently gathered west of the Guodian-Xinzheng highway and in Mi County, and it is reported that it has begun to move southwest.

[Another Dispatch] A part of the bandit army east of Luoyang recently fled westward through the Heishiguan Bridge west of Gong County, inquiring along the way about the distance from Luoyang to Hengshui and from Hengshui to the south bank of the Yellow River, seemingly intending to cross north.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou Fourteenth Dispatch] Liu's bandit brigades 1, 2, 3, 6, and 11 were intercepted into two groups in eastern Henan by the National Army's courageous pursuit and fierce annihilation. Liu's bandit brigades 2, 3, and 6 have fled west across the Pinghan Railway. A part fled to Wuyang yesterday, and a part fled to Shahedian from Yifengdian, seemingly continuing to flee northwest. Liu's bandit brigades 1 and 11 were intercepted by the National Army's Qiu Qingquan unit near Qixian and Suixian. After days of heavy blows, casualties were quite heavy. Yesterday, they fled north across the Longhai Railway from the Yejigang area of Neihuang.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou Fourteenth Dispatch] Liu's bandits brigades 2, 3, and 6 and the remnants of Chen's bandit brigade 10, who had fled to the Sui Ping, Xiping, and Yancheng areas on the Pinghan Railway in Henan Province, were unable to stand their ground due to the pincer attack from the north and south by the National Army. Yesterday, they began to flee westward to the Funiu Mountains. The National Army is pursuing fiercely between Chuanyang and Biyang. (There are more suppression and annihilation battle reports on page two)

### Henan National Representatives Submit Letter to the Chairman, Demanding the Dispatch of Troops for Clearing Operations Within a Time Limit

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] All Henan National Representatives, Zhang Fang and more than 100 others, drafted a letter to Chairman Chiang, which will be presented to the Chairman within one or two days, requesting three things: (1) There are too few troops stationed in Henan Province now, which is insufficient for guarding points and powerless for chasing and suppressing, only allowing the treacherous bandits to grow stronger. Please dispatch five reorganized National Army corps to do their best to pursue and eliminate them within a time limit, and unify command and strictly enforce military discipline. (2) The Henan Provincial Security Forces had previously requested and been approved by your office for five brigades, and approved for the allocation of 80% of weapons and ammunition. Half a year has passed, but they have not yet been received. Please order them to be allocated quickly according to the approved number. (3) The civilian armed forces in Henan Province have suffered great losses due to the attacks of bandit field armies one after another. Please allocate 10 million rounds of ammunition to supplement the civilian teams.

### National Assembly Proceedings: Listening to the People's Voices Through National Representatives

[Special Report from This Newspaper] "Chairman! Chairman! An emergency motion! The political and economic review needs to be extended and continued tomorrow."

"Chairman, my request to speak was submitted to the podium early yesterday morning. Why am I still not allowed to speak?"

"Chairman! Chairman!" The afternoon session on the 14th ended in chaos, but a small group of representatives swarmed the podium again because they hadn't noticed that the meeting on the 13th had already passed a motion to combine the economic review with the political review on the 14th, and if time was insufficient, it would continue on the morning of the 18th (Sunday). The Chairman was extremely nervous, and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou held the meeting minutes and rules of procedure, but couldn't reason with them. Chairman Chen Lianfen saw that the situation was not right and slipped away, disappearing without a trace.

In recent days, the government's boilerplate reports didn't seem to attract much attention. Everyone was using the review as an opportunity to speak for themselves. But despite the reviews, the meeting hall was always sparsely populated during the afternoon review sessions. After today's recess, the number of attendees was at most only about a thousand.

Nearly two hundred people wanted to review the economic and political policy reports. From the speeches of fifteen people on the afternoon of the 14th, we can already see some of the sentiments of the people. Representatives from the neglected border regions made appeals. Representatives from the economically strangled Northeast lodged protests. Representatives from the recovered areas painfully accused the corrupt officials in charge of the takeover. The general consensus was to punish corrupt officials, and some even proposed using the funds that had fled to the United States to help suppress the rebellion. He Min, a farmer representative from Shanxi, was a genuine peasant. He said, "There are no seeds to plant." Zhao Yongfu from Shandong severely criticized the factional infighting that was ruining the country. Except for the first representative, whose life was special and who spoke incoherently and was booed off, the quick-witted remarks of the other fourteen representatives were greeted with enthusiastic applause from the representatives in the hall, while the government officials in the audience remained silent.

The Mongolian representatives Duo Duobo and Zaqisqin were both outstanding speakers. Duo Duobo accused the central government of failing to fulfill its promises regarding the autonomy of the leagues and banners of Mongolia, saying that the Executive Yuan's delay in the legislative process for the draft law on local autonomy of leagues and banners prepared by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was deception and a breach of the constitution. Zaqisqin questioned why there was no border administration report? Why wasn't the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission given real power? He questioned how much money the state had spent on border construction, education, and relief.

The Xinjiang representatives Mutiyi and Tu Legan both emphasized unity. They said that in the reports of the government ministers, they didn't even hear the term "border region." Mutiyi first asked if the area outside the Great Wall was Chinese territory. Then he accused Wu Zhongxin of neglecting the ethnic factors of Xinjiang's politics and society. Fortunately, Zhang Zhizhong's enlightened policies and outstanding achievements had won back the hearts of the people. He said, "The people of Xinjiang are worried that General Zhang will not always be in charge of Xinjiang. Once he leaves, what will happen when someone else takes over? We ask the central government to have a permanent border ethnic policy to give everyone confidence and comfort."

Chuan Zhengda, the Yi representative from Xikang, said, "The Yi people in the southwest have 300,000 rifles. Why doesn't the government organize, train, and reuse them to defend the southwest?"

Xie Zhengqiang, a representative from Taiwan, shouted, "Does the government want Taiwan or not? Does it want Taiwan or not!" He said that the order in Taiwan had been completely destroyed. He protested against the special treatment of people from the mainland, which made the people of Taiwan feel like they were still in a colony. The promises made by Minister Bai during his visit to comfort them had not come true, but the people of Taiwan would never demand independence, nor would they demand trusteeship. "Taiwan will always be China's, and the hearts of the people of Taiwan are with the motherland!"

Lin Naishan and Yang Zhiping, representatives from the Northeast, emphasized that the economy of the Northeast was ten times more serious than the military situation. Lin Naishan said that the legal tender and Ji military notes stamped by Du Weiming were not being exchanged by Zhang Jiaao. The amount of currency in circulation exceeded 5 trillion (equivalent to nearly 60 trillion legal tender at the official rate), making it akin to ghost money and waste paper. He said, "This is all thanks to Mr. Zhang Jiaao's virtuous governance. Our only request is that the currency in circulation be allowed to enter the customs at the official rate of 11.5 to 1. The people of the Northeast are eating soybean cakes and pig food. We are also Chinese people. Why are you using this special method to trap us outside the customs, starving us to death! Please, Mr. Zhang Jiaao, spare the lives of the 40 million people in the Northeast! We are truly grateful." Yang Zhiping accused the Northeast Headquarters of mismanagement, saying that the people's stored grain and more than one million tons of soybeans available for export last year were looted by bandits. Cui Rong advocated fighting tigers and also advocated abolishing unnecessary special administrative institutions in the Northeast.

Li Weizhou, a representative from Hebei, pointed out that political incompetence lay in the lack of clear division of powers and responsibilities, and political corruption lay in the lack of renewal of cadres. Yu Huafeng questioned the Coal Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, asking where the money from selling 100,000 tons of coal shipped south to Shanghai factories, earning 6 million per ton, went, since it wasn't turned over to the national army.

Fu Dechun, a representative from Hinggan, requested that deposits in the United States be used, with representatives from the National Assembly going to the United States to negotiate their use, and that we organize a "Committee for the Use of Capital of Powerful Families and Cliques" to strengthen the suppression of the rebellion.

These were the opinions expressed by the fourteen representatives who spoke on political and economic reviews on the 14th, reflecting the will of the people, showing consensus in differences, and revealing positivity in complaints. (April 14th, Nanjing)

### Editorial: The First Round of the Cold War in the Americas

While the Pan-American Conference is holding important discussions in Bogotá, a "red coup" suddenly occurred in Colombia, which not only aroused the world's attention to the future development of the Colombian political situation, but also aroused deep concern about the safety of Secretary of State Marshall and the continuation of the Pan-American Conference. In the past few days, the "red coup" plan has failed, and the joint new government organized by the Liberal and Conservative parties has been formally established; at the same time, the Pan-American Conference is still continuing there. On the surface, this turmoil can be quelled here; but from another perspective, the Cold War engaged in by the United States and the Soviet Union has spread from Europe and Asia to South America. The coup in Colombia was just the first round of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union in South America.

The reason is that after the coup in Colombia, the government and the public of the United States and Colombia unanimously believed that this was a conspiracy by the Communist Party to undermine the Pan-American Conference. Therefore, as soon as the new Colombian government was proclaimed, it immediately announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union on the grounds that the Communist Party participated in the riots; at the same time, Secretary of State Marshall also openly condemned the Communist Party's attempt to incite world revolution to representatives of various countries. He said, "The Colombian coup is actually the same type of event as inciting strikes in countries such as France and Italy and attempting to hinder the Italian elections. When we take action here, we must understand that this event is a world event, not just limited to Colombia or Latin America. The Communist Party deliberately instigated the coup in order to undermine the Pan-American Conference, so as to embarrass the Western Hemisphere and thus affect the Italian elections in April." From Secretary Marshall's brief remarks, it can also be seen that the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union has spread from Europe and Asia to South America. The coup in Colombia is just the first step in the other side's launch of the Cold War in South America; Chile and Bolivia and other countries have the possibility of similar coups. Recently, rumors have filled the city of Chile, saying that the Communist Party will launch a coup on May 1, with a great atmosphere of panic, so that the Chilean authorities have to take emergency national defense measures to prevent the Communist Party from launching a coup.

The US authorities have always attached great importance to this Pan-American Conference. Secretary of State Marshall personally went to participate, holding the motivation of "we must first settle the domestic affairs before resisting foreign aggression," requesting the countries of the Western Hemisphere to strengthen unity, implement joint defense, and unanimously resist foreign aggression. Therefore, the main agenda of this conference is: one is to establish a Permanent American Defense Committee to implement the Pan-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance established last year; the second is to sign a Pan-American Economic Cooperation Agreement; and the third is to establish a Pan-American Peace System. From this, we can know that the task of this Pan-American Conference is actually very important, no less than the basis for the United States to engage in the Cold War with the Soviet Union in Europe. Therefore, from the Soviet Union's point of view, it believes that the United States is attempting to strengthen its political, economic, and military control over the countries of South America through the Pan-American Conference, so it cannot avoid having a conspiracy to undermine the Pan-American Conference, and instigating a coup in Colombia is naturally a powerful counterattack by the Soviet Union against the United States. At the opening of the Pan-American Conference, we had already pointed out that the representatives of the 21 countries in the Americas were frightened by the crisis of the Communist forces infiltrating all parts of the world, and they were even more convinced that the Western Hemisphere needed to cooperate closely to strengthen ties; and we predicted that this conference would definitely achieve satisfactory results. Now, affected by the coup in Colombia, the conference was once suspended, and whether it can be concluded as scheduled has indeed become a problem. But from another perspective: the coup in Colombia made the representatives of the 21 countries feel the terror of the red color, everyone personally witnessed it, and everyone was shocked, deeply feeling the threat of the Communist forces, which is bound to further promote their unity.

But the greatest significance of the coup in Colombia is to give Secretary of State Marshall a blow to the head, making him realize that the opposition of the two worlds does not have a geographical demarcation line, dividing the two worlds clearly. As in Europe, there is a distinction between Eastern Europe and Western Europe; and the Communist forces are like mercury leaking to the ground, infiltrating everywhere. In any corner of today's world, there are Communist forces lurking, which can appear at any time and struggle at any time. Europe is like this, Asia is like this, and even in the Americas, it is like this. Secretary of State Marshall only saw the crisis in Europe, and neglected the threat of Communist forces in other places, stubbornly adhering to his "Europe First" policy, unwilling to change it slightly. We believe that the US government will sooner or later recast historical mistakes. We deeply hope that Secretary Marshall can accept the lesson of the coup in Colombia, thoroughly review the current diplomatic policy, broaden his horizons, take charge of the overall situation, and make wise decisions early to save the world from collapse!

Secondly, we stand in the position of a third party, looking at the Cold War being waged by the United States and the Soviet Union with a cold eye. We only see that the Soviet Union acts quickly, has clever methods, takes the initiative everywhere, and takes every step first. Whether in Europe or Asia, it has already been in an unshakable position; moreover, the Soviet Union is not satisfied with this. In Europe, the Soviet Union is trying to move its curtain towards the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, and there will be amazing actions for the Italian elections in April and the French elections in May; for Germany, it will use the German people's dissatisfaction with the British and Americans to launch an anti-British and anti-American movement in East Germany, West Germany, and Berlin. Not to mention this in Asia, the Soviet Union has long been prepared for Korea, and it is constantly providing assistance to the Chinese Communist Party. Southeast Asia already has the organization of the Communist International. But looking back at the United States, we only hear a cry of anti-communism, but we do not see actual and effective actions. A year ago, we had already heard the advocacy of the Truman Doctrine and the promotion of the Marshall Plan, but what has the United States done in the past year? No one can help but express doubts; President Truman was stimulated by the Czech coup, and only then did he express that his confidence in world peace had begun to waver, and only then did he advocate that the United States should implement conscription and universal military training. It is an undeniable fact that the US authorities lack foresight and foresight for the post-war world. Even today, the "utopia" Western Hemisphere where the United States is located has felt the threat of Communist forces. Although the coup in Colombia has been exposed, who can guarantee that the same coup will not occur in other South American countries! Therefore, the coup in Colombia is the first round of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Americas, no less than a serious warning to the US government and the public, so that they can no longer decorate the world in peace, and they must pay special attention to the current international crisis.

### Wang Yitang Applies for Commutation, Returned to Hebei High Court for Retrial

### The Story of the Relief of Zhuoyang

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent on the Central China Battlefield, Bu Mian

[Our Newspaper Fuyang, 11th] Fuyang, formerly Yingzhou Prefecture, is located at the intersection of the Ying and Shang rivers, a major transportation route in Henan and Anhui, and the largest city in northern Anhui. In history, it has already written a glorious chapter. This time, the two bandits Liu and Chen gathered a crowd of 80,000, claiming that they would capture Fuyang within three days. As a result, they not only failed to enter the city, but were defeated by the National Army and routed. If our memory of history is not too bad, we should remember that during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty, Liu Qi once used 40,000 troops to defeat the invading army of Jin Wuzhu, which numbered hundreds of thousands. Today's victory in Fuyang is somewhat similar.

Liu Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 11th divisions, and Chen Yi's 10th Column, the four regiments of Jin Shaoshan's Independent Brigade, and Wei Fenglou's Independent Brigade, totaling more than 80,000 men, carrying three days' worth of rations, were led by Liu Fei himself as the chief commander to invade Fuyang. They launched a full-scale siege offensive at 12:00 midnight on the 29th, besieging the eastern, southern, and western suburbs of Fuyang. Our defending troops, under the command of Commander Li, calmly responded to the battle and bravely fought back. At dawn on the 30th, the main force of Jin Fei's Independent Brigade attacked the western suburbs alone, while its main force still attacked the eastern, southern, and northern suburbs. Our air force squadrons dispatched and assisted in the battle from the air. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, and their offensive was frustrated. Their morale was depressed, and they immediately stopped their fierce offensive to adjust their forces and redeploy. On the one hand, they continued to reinforce and prepare to counterattack again.

At 11:00 a.m. on the 30th, the bandit reinforcements were discovered in the Lixianpu, Majiadian, and Chahuamiao areas of the Fuyang-Mengcheng Highway. Our westward advancing troops of the Qiu Division immediately intercepted them. In the evening, the bandits first used two companies to launch a fierce attack on the suburbs of the city as a probing attack. After a slight resistance from our army, they retreated. They then launched a large-scale offensive, concentrating their forces on one point, and fiercely battled in the Dongguan area. One of the most advantageous units of our Qiu Weida Division, despite being outnumbered, still firmly defended its position and vowed to resist to the death. Dongguan was lost and regained three times, and the bandits suffered heavy casualties. This was the highest point of the battle's progress.

After suffering this blow, the bandits' attempt to besiege Zhuoyang was invisibly shaken. In order to save "face" and fulfill his promise to capture Fuyang in three days, Liu Fei still made a desperate gamble. At dawn on the 31st, the bandits bombarded our city walls with mountain artillery and used the firepower of heavy weapons as cover to continue attacking the strongholds in the northeast pass. Our army also used a dense network of fire to prevent the bandit army from advancing. The two sides were in a stalemate. The bandits, whose offensive was blocked and who were in a dilemma whether to advance or retreat, did not hesitate to make major sacrifices and implemented "human wave tactics" to break through the strongholds in the northeast. However, after dawn, our air force flew over the area and dropped dozens of bombs, and the strongholds were recovered again. Until 10:00 p.m., the bandit army launched a third assault. The artillery positions (more than a dozen mountain guns) in the suburbs northwest and north pass, west pass, Dongyue Temple, Sanliyuan, and other places continuously bombarded us to cover their advance. The bandits attacked the north pass fiercely. Before long, the bandits at the Guandi Temple and the Wenfeng Pagoda outside the east pass and the Dandanchang outside the west pass used signal flares and Russian-made command guns as guidance, and used smoke screens and heavy fire to cover their repeated attacks. Our defending troops still firmly defended their positions and made a desperate resistance. The fighting was particularly fierce outside the east pass and the southeast corner, the Wenfeng Pagoda, the north pass, and the northeast corner. After a night of fierce fighting, the embankment outside the east pass was destroyed by bandit artillery fire. Our army made its best efforts and bravely fought for it several times, but it was ultimately outnumbered. By 6:00 a.m. on the 1st, our army automatically cleared the firing range and moved the position in the east pass to continue blocking. The bandits used the cover of powerful artillery fire to approach our position and used landmine explosions to destroy the obstacles in our position. The defending troops fought bloody battles and, at a great price, abandoned the Wenfeng Pagoda, but all the other positions were still in our hands.

When the opening battle of Fuyang was unveiled, the elite corps of our Yu Nan Commander Zhang rushed to the north for reinforcements in heavy rain. At the height of the siege of Fuyang on the 31st, General Zhang, with lightning speed, crossed the Hong River from Fangjiaji, Zhao Ji, and Ma Lidian. The bandit army was overwhelmed by the wind and fled like a broken bamboo. The next day, it advanced to Gongliqiao and Xieji. The bandits' rear and flanks were under serious threat. If they continued to besiege Fuyang, they would all be annihilated in the suburbs of Fuyang. At the same time, the bandit's 36th Column was also ambushed by Zhang's troops, suffering heavy casualties. The siege of Fuyang was lifted. In this battle, the bandits suffered more than 10,000 casualties, more than 1,000 were captured, and a large number of spoils were seized.

The siege of Fuyang has been lifted. Although it has gone through four days of tension, it has returned to its tranquility and peace.

### The Soviet Union Rejects the Return of Trieste to Italy; British Warships Arrive in Trieste to Prevent Disturbances

[Our Newspaper News] London, 14th Broadcast: Trieste message, the situation here is very tense after the Soviet Union announced its rejection of the Anglo-American proposal to return Trieste to Italy. The Communist-controlled Labor Union held a special meeting, which is expected to obstruct pro-Italian demonstrations. The special work call issued at midnight yesterday has had an impact. Most shops and bakeries have been closed, except for military bases, hospitals, and charitable institutions. Italian newspapers in Trieste published the news of the Soviet Union's rejection of the Anglo-American proposal with the headline "Now We Must Know Who Italy's Enemies Are." Police have taken alert measures to prevent conflicts. In addition, the British aircraft carrier "Victorious" arrived in Trieste escorted by the destroyer "Cheviot" from Venice.

[United Press London, 13th] Moscow Radio broadcast tonight that the Soviet Union has submitted a note to the United States, Britain, and France, rejecting the three countries' proposal to convene a four-nation conference to discuss the issue of returning Trieste to Italy. The Soviet Union believes that the designation of Trieste as a free zone is stipulated in the Italian Peace Treaty, which was drafted by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and signed by 21 countries. It is not only difficult to accept the modification of this treaty by means of communication or the convening of private meetings, but also contrary to democratic principles.

[Agence France-Presse Rome, 14th] The Soviet Union's rejection of the proposal to return Trieste to Italy has caused panic in political circles here. The Italian government does not conceal its significant dissatisfaction, especially with the rumors that the Soviet Union will take action during the Italian general election to "assist the Italian People's Front."

[Associated Press London, 13th] It is generally observed that the Soviet Union's rejection of the US, British, and French proposal of March 20 is a response to the serious blow to the Communist Party in the Italian general election on April 18.

[United Press Trieste, 14th] Pro-Italian factions here are very frustrated to learn that the Soviet Union has refused to discuss the return of Trieste to Italy. 50,000 people were originally scheduled to meet in United Square tomorrow night, and the tone of the declaration issued at that time may be changed as a result. Some people believe that it may develop into an anti-Soviet demonstration. Others said that the Soviet Union's move is tantamount to admitting that the Italian Communist Party will fail in the general election on the 18th.

### Italian Election Campaign Heats Up; US Planes Will Fly in Formation as a Show of Force; Italian Prime Minister Reveals Communist Conspiracy to Obstruct European Recovery

[Reuters New York, 13th] Denver Post reporter Carysen from "B-29 Aircraft in the Atlantic" telegraphed the newspaper that several US Superfortress aircraft will fly in the Italian sky before the Italian general election on Sunday "to show the strength of Western powers," and then the aircraft will fly to Saudi Arabia. The United States has a large B-29 aircraft base in that country, which is very close to most areas of the Soviet Union.

[Reuters Rome, 14th] With only four days left before Italy's first general election in 25 years, the election campaigns of various political parties are becoming increasingly heated. All kinds of slogans and magical marks convenient for illiterate people to identify appear on roads, sidewalks, walls, and eaves.

The symbol of the Christian Democratic Party is a Crusader shield with the word "Freedom" written on it. The People's Front led by the Communist Party uses a pattern with a red star as the background and the portrait of the Italian sage Garibaldi printed on it as a symbol. Voters only need to draw a cross on the symbol to vote for which party. The election campaign is scheduled to stop 48 hours before voting begins on April 16. Prime Minister Gasperi and Communist leader Togliatti are touring the country to give speeches. Most of them speak in the same city, sometimes only an hour apart. After Gasperi gave a speech in Milan yesterday, he went to Palermo in southern Sicily today. His last election speech will be delivered in Naples. Togliatti also decided to deliver his last election speech at the same venue an hour after Gasperi's speech in Naples.

[Reuters Rome, 13th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi addressed a large crowd in the square in front of the Milan Cathedral on the 13th, revealing that he had obtained secret documents proving that the Communist Party has a secret plan to oppose the Marshall Plan, intending to create widespread unrest in various beneficiary countries. The document details the meeting between Italian Communist leader Longo and Soviet Communist Party leader Stanov in Bialystok, Poland. Detailed instructions were given at the meeting regarding the plan to oppose the Marshall Plan, including creating widespread unrest in countries such as France and Italy, so that US aid would have to be withdrawn. The document also stated that the Italian Communist Party would not lack the means to implement this plan in order to carry out this plan. Gasperi reiterated his request in previous election speeches in Milan, which is known as the base of the Italian Communist Party, urging the Communist leader to order the Communist Party to lay down their weapons. This remark won applause from the entire venue. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti also broadcast to the country on the night of the 13th, emphatically stating that the People's Front resolutely refuses to participate in any group or alliance that could lead Italy into a new war in order to save the interests of the Italian people.

### Berlin Plane Crash Investigation Encounters Obstacles

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] The Anglo-Soviet joint committee investigating the mid-air collision of British and Soviet aircraft met on the 14th, but the Soviet representative did not attend, and the investigation was conducted solely by the British representative. The Soviet side had previously stated that this was a joint Anglo-Soviet investigation and could only hear testimony from British and Soviet witnesses, not from American or German witnesses. The British side believes that although the investigation is a joint Anglo-Soviet effort, the hearing of testimony cannot be limited to witnesses from the two countries. The British side also stated that regardless of whether the Soviet Union continues to participate in or withdraws from the investigation, the British side will continue with the investigation.

### Soviets Tighten Control Over Berlin, Attempting to Abolish Four-Power Joint Police System, Mongolian Troops Arrive in Northern Suburbs of Berlin

[United Press, Berlin, 13th] The "Post Courier", registered here with the French authorities, reported that new Soviet troops, mainly composed of Mongolian soldiers, have arrived in the northern suburbs of Berlin, stationed near the village of Schwanebeck, 15 miles north of Berlin.

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Before the meeting of the Berlin Four-Power Joint Command last night, the Soviet Union attempted to end the four-power joint control of the Berlin police system and deny the authority of the Berlin transport director, Rühe.

The Soviet Union accused the United States of effectively removing the police in the American sector of Berlin from the control of the central police station and of using the police to suppress democratic elements among the residents of the sector. As a result, theft is rampant in the American sector. If the four-power joint police system is terminated, it will provide the Soviet Union with an excuse to implement border checks at the junctions of various districts in Berlin. Denying the authority of the Berlin transport director, Rühe, is also likely a prelude to tightening control over the supply sources to the Berlin area.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 13th] According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union will demand that the Allies stop air passenger flights between the western zones of Germany and Berlin in the coming days.

### British and American Cotton Textile Merchants Meet, Advocate Reducing Japanese Production

The proceeds from barter should be entirely consumed in Japan or the United States. The meeting also agreed that the United States could continue its current textile export volume, and the United Kingdom could increase its exports.

### Order Gradually Restored in Colombia, Pan-American Conference Reopened Yesterday, Aiming to Complete the Pan-American Convention Quickly

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The State Department received a report from the Foreign Correspondents Association in Bogota stating that the Pan-American Conference, which was interrupted by the outbreak of the Colombian revolution, will resume on the 14th. The United States has agreed to airlift military food supplies from Panama to Bogota to support the participating delegates. To ensure that the conference can be concluded quickly, the delegates have agreed to temporarily shelve the economic issues on the agenda, including the issue of US aid to Latin America, and leave them for discussion at a special Pan-American economic conference to be held in Buenos Aires in the second half of the year.

[Reuters, Bogota, 13th] The first major attempt made by the international communists in the Western Hemisphere after the war has failed, according to Secretary of State Marshall's assessment of the current revolutionary movement in Colombia. Only one or two gunshots were occasionally heard in Bogota on the 12th night. After a storm, Bogota has become quiet, and although the city has not yet recovered, the situation is under the control of the authorities. Delegates from the Pan-American Conference are protected by armed teams dispatched by the Colombian authorities. The Colombian government has assured the delegations of all countries of safety and order, and it is determined that it can be fully restored by next Sunday. Sources revealed that the meetings of the Pan-American Conference will be held in the residences of the delegates in the suburbs, and most of the issues will be directly handled by a comprehensive committee composed of the chief delegates, without intending to submit them to the working committee for review and research. Therefore, it is necessary to complete the Pan-American Organization Convention within a few days and pass a stern anti-communist resolution. It was also revealed that Marshall's personal safety was once threatened last Friday when a rebel radio station accused Marshall of being involved in the murder of Colombian Liberal leader Gaitán, intending to incite the masses to attack Marshall. Fortunately, the Colombian government dispatched a price team to protect Marshall's residence within an hour of the outbreak of the riots, and no major disaster occurred. Marshall has frankly expressed his belief that the unrest in Colombia is closely related to the world crisis and the general election in Italy.

### Revolution in Costa Rica, Capital City Surrounded

### Palestinian Situation Deteriorates, Five-Nation Committee Asks General Assembly to Maintain Security, US Representative Proposes Ceasefire Plan to Security Council

[United Press, Lake Success, 13th] The United Nations Five-Nation Committee on Palestine plans to submit a report tonight to the United Nations Special General Assembly on the 16th, advocating that the United Nations send troops to Palestine to maintain security after the British mandate ends next month to avoid great chaos, regardless of the General Assembly's decision on the partition plan. The report stated: "The situation in Palestine is deteriorating step by step, inevitably leading people to believe that after the British end their mandate, if there are no appropriate troops to restore and maintain local security, chaos, famine, major conflicts, riots, and bloodshed will inevitably occur throughout Palestine."

### Curbing Public Utility Price Hikes, Unreasonable Price Calculation Formula, Requesting the Executive Yuan to Restore Subsidy Policy, Resolution of the Public Utility Investigation Committee of the Senate

[Our Report] The Public Utility Investigation Committee of the Municipal Senate held its first meeting at the Committee's office on Tanggu Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Attending senators included Tang Shichang, Zhu Yakui, Xi Xia, Zhu Fuju, Li Kaidi, Gao Shu'an, and 30 others. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utility Bureau, was present. The items discussed were: (1) How to request the central government to change the central government's approved price adjustment formula for public utilities. Resolution: Since the central government promulgated the price calculation formula for public utilities in January of this year, the prices of various public utilities in the city have been adjusted four times, with each increase being significant. However, the treatment of public teachers, staff of industrial and commercial circles has not been able to be reasonably adjusted in comparison with the increase in prices. The central government first set the method for the prices of public utilities, acknowledging that they can be adjusted monthly according to the increase in the cost of living index and the price index, which is even more than the increase in the cost of living index, exceeding the affordability of the general public, which is obviously unfair. For this reason, it is resolved that the Executive Yuan should be telegraphed to consider stopping the continued application of the price calculation formula for public utilities and restoring the subsidy policy to curb the price increases of public utilities, so as to avoid leading the general price increases, and to request that before the central government decides on appropriate measures, this formula should be suspended from application from May onwards, so as to avoid causing serious consequences of social unrest. (2) How should the investigation work be carried out. Resolution: There are many improprieties in the calculation formula. Please ask the Public Utility Bureau to study and revise it. As for the actual situation of the company's profits and losses, personnel allocation, and other uses of fuel and raw materials, the committee will conduct investigations in three groups, and please first collect and supply sufficient materials. The personnel of each group will be designated by the speaker. The grouping methods are as follows: A. Group 1 - Tap water, electricity, gas. B. Group 2 - Telephone. C. Group 3 - Tram, bus, ferry, small railway. The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM.

Attending Committee Members Spoke Out Criticizing, Hoping the Responsible Authorities Would Pay Attention, Seeking Emergency and Reasonable Measures

At yesterday's meeting, various committee members spoke out one after another criticizing the continuous and drastic increase in public utility prices in April. Telephone, electricity, and tap water were the targets of criticism from all parties. Yan Esheng especially raised the public utility price payment strike movement recently launched by the Beijing Municipal Senate, hoping that the responsible authorities would face the seriousness of high-priced public utilities and seek emergency and reasonable measures. Li Wenjie continued with an even more intense speech, constantly criticizing the public utility price calculation formula decided by the Economic and Financial Council. He pointed out that the calculation formula contains the most drastically rising metal index, cost of living index, and foreign exchange. Even if the calculation formula is reasonable in principle, it becomes unreasonable alone today when the work treatment of the vast majority of citizens is unreasonable. He also stated that the municipal utilities are all private enterprises, and the local council has the power to restrict them according to law. If necessary, the Senate may convene a temporary general meeting to request the central government to reconsider, without having to stick to the formula formulated by a few experts who do not understand the actual situation, making it impossible for citizens to bear the burden. This opinion was warmly responded to in the meeting, and after detailed discussion, the above two resolutions were made.

Director Zhao Indicated That Restoring Subsidies is Not Easy

After the meeting, the reporter further inquired about Director Zhao's opinion on the above two resolutions. According to Director Zhao, the Senate's opinion represents public opinion, and the government should respect it. However, regarding the first point, requesting the central government to stop the continued application of the price calculation formula for public utilities from May onwards and restoring the subsidy policy is difficult in fact and not easy to do in a short period of time. Whether the central government can approve it is quite questionable. According to Director Zhao, he is actively discussing the raw material prices of public utilities with President Zhang of the Central Bank, trying to find ways to avoid high prices as much as possible. Recently, he discussed with President Zhang to request approval for the foreign exchange for oil used by public utilities to be settled one and a half or two months in advance. If permitted by the central government, this can indirectly stabilize the prices of public utilities slightly.

As for the second item regarding the Senate's investigation work, the Public Utility Bureau is determined to collect sufficient materials and supply them to the Senate for reference and review. If there are any questions after the review, they can directly inquire or investigate the relevant companies.

### Severe Disaster in Pixian, Northern Jiangsu, Various Groups Organize Emergency Relief

### The Mystery of the World's Highest Peak: Decisive Outcome Expected Within Three Days - China National Aviation Corporation Special Plane Flies to Jishi Mountain, Employing Radar to Measure Altitude

Chen Wen-kuan Believes It Unlikely to Exceed Mount Everest

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jishi Mountain exploration project has been officially declared terminated since the failure of the Dianuo expedition, which started strong but ended disappointingly. The mystery of Jishi Mountain's height has become the focus of widespread attention. The "Self-Reliance Exploration" plan is being actively promoted by the National Central Research Institute. However, due to the temporary lack of scientific equipment, it will not be possible to implement it until the Mid-Autumn Festival at the earliest. In order to reveal the "mystery" as soon as possible, the China National Aviation Corporation has specially dispatched a C47 type XTT62 special plane, inviting Chinese and foreign journalists from the city to fly to Jishi Mountain for a preliminary measurement.

The special plane is scheduled to take off from Longhua Airport at 7:00 AM this morning, arriving in Lanzhou on the same day. After staying overnight in Lanzhou, it will fly to Jishi Mountain for exploration the next morning. If the weather is good and the flight goes smoothly, results will be obtained on the same day, and the return to Shanghai can be expected the day after tomorrow.

The special plane will be piloted by Chen Wen-kuan, Deputy General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Chen flew over the "Hump" of the Himalayas more than a hundred times. It is reported that Mr. Chen has also flown over Jishi Mountain several times. Based on his experience, he believes that the claim that Jishi Mountain's height exceeds the world's highest Mount Everest is impossible. Now, Mr. Chen has decided to use the "radar" equipment on the special plane to measure the distance between the plane and the summit of Jishi Mountain, and then calculate the accurate height of Jishi Mountain based on the aircraft's altimeter. It is reported that using "radar" to measure mountain height is accurate but not precise. However, according to Mr. Chen, he seems quite confident in proving that Jishi Mountain does not exceed the height of Mount Everest. Therefore, whether Jishi Mountain can ascend to the throne of the world's highest peak is expected to be revealed in two or three days.

A total of twelve journalists are accompanying the plane, and the list is as follows: Lu Naigang and Xuan Wenjie from the Central News Agency; Yuan Lunren from the Associated Press; John Lauterbach from the United Press; Casick Hubbell from the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury; Jack Burns from Life Magazine; George Alexander from the New York Times; Zhu Renjun and Dai Shengchao from the Central Photography Studio; Wei Zhigang from the Xinwen Bao; and Hong Xucai from this newspaper.

### Mortgage Credit Cooperative Suspected of Dealing in Gold and Foreign Currency - Manager and Broker Arrested and Transferred to the District Procuratorate

A confidential report was recently received by the Economic Section of the Garrison Headquarters, stating that the Shanghai Mortgage Credit Cooperative at No. 260 Tianjin Road was suspected of illegally dealing in gold and foreign currency on the black market. Zhang Yamin, Chief of the Economic Section of the Garrison Headquarters, sent personnel to investigate, and sent Zhao Baichuan (pseudonym) to negotiate the purchase of nine large bars of gold with Zhou Huacheng, a gold and foreign currency black market broker, paying with a Central Bank promissory note worth 3.5 billion yuan and 100 million yuan in cash. On the day of the transaction, the manager of the cooperative, Chen Anning, and the broker, Zhou Huacheng, were arrested on the spot.

After the Wanli ship of Fumin Shipping Company ran aground near Beishengshan on the morning of the 12th, an urgent telegram was sent to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which dispatched the Xilin ship to rescue it. The ship returned to Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday. Captain Cai reported the rescue situation to the families of the passengers in distress. It is said that the Xilin ship arrived at the scene of the accident at 8:30 AM on the 13th. After the Wanli ship ran aground, it was close to a shallow beach on the mountainside. Most of the ship was still above the water, with only the stern submerged. The passengers and crew on board had safely landed, and all the doors, windows, and other equipment on the ship were in good condition.

However, Mr. Hou promised to assist, and said that the Navy had already dispatched three warships to assist in the investigation after the Wanli ship accident. At present, Shanghai has not yet received a detailed report, so he promised to do everything possible to find out the details, and promised to introduce the naval authorities in Qingdao, Tianjin, Yantai, and other places to facilitate assistance to the passengers' family representatives. The Shanghai family representatives are scheduled to go to the Air Force Command again this morning to request assistance in the rescue.

### The General Labor Union Urges Industry Unions to Persuade Communist Party Members to Surrender, Promising to Guarantee Safety and Freedom

The Shanghai General Labor Union issued a notice to all industry unions yesterday in order to urge workers who have participated in the Communist Party organization to quickly reflect and surrender. It urged them to earnestly persuade them and to carefully report any lurking Communist Party members. The original text is as follows: "It has been found that in March, the military and police authorities in this city cracked down on important secret organs of the Communist bandits in Shanghai. Based on the documents obtained, a large number of traitorous Communist Party members were arrested. After understanding the inside story, this union made a solemn statement, absolutely supporting the government's elimination of the Communist bandits. As for good workers, we should be responsible for their protection. On April 5, we published a letter to the military and political authorities and labor and management parties in this city, requesting the government to try the arrested workers as soon as possible according to law, to protect good workers, to allow those who blindly followed to have a way to reform, and to request the factory owners to uphold the spirit of labor-management cooperation, avoid taking this opportunity to oppress workers, or make things difficult for the union. We also advise all workers to work hard to maintain self-discipline and peace of mind. Now the government has made it clear that those who have been induced to participate in the work of the Communist bandits, if they quickly surrender to the government, will definitely be given the opportunity to reform, and their jobs and physical safety can be guaranteed. In recent times, many people have surrendered to the government, and they have all received practical protection and freedom. These are all facts. However, the number of workers in this city is quite large. This union is deeply afraid that there may still be people who have gone astray or who have previously participated in the work of the Communist bandits and now regret it but are afraid to surrender. We hope that your union will earnestly persuade them to quickly surrender to the government. This union will guarantee that they will be protected by the government, and we hope that you will carefully report any lurking Communist Party members in order to eliminate the source of the chaos. This will be in line with the great plan of the country to suppress chaos and build the nation, and it will be able to stabilize social order."

### Tao Yunshan Talks About His Experience of Participating in the Communist Party

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tao Yunshan, chairman of the Silk Weaving Industry Union in the former Third District, who had participated in the Communist Party and surrendered to the police station last month, and was recently released on bail the day before yesterday, talked about his experience of participating in the Communist Party at the Social Bureau yesterday afternoon at the request of reporters. He detailed his experience of going to the bandit area for training, being assigned to Shanghai to carry out activities, and his recent surrender. Tao is from Shaoxing and studied at Shaoxing Junior High School. He once worked as a primary school teacher. He came to Shanghai in 1938 and entered the Maya Silk Factory to learn the craft. Under the bayonets of the enemy, he launched patriotic movements everywhere. The Maya workers, led by a certain Chen, organized the "Thrift and Save the Nation Association," raising funds to remit to the Chongqing Central Bank, and organizing anti-puppet unions. Tao also participated in the activities and was elected as a worker representative. He was greatly influenced by Chen's thoughts, and Chen was actually a Communist Party cadre. In 1941, Chen left Shanghai for the mainland, handing over all the work to Tao before leaving, and introducing Tao to join the Communist Party. By December 8 of the same year, when the United States and Japan went to war, the Japanese army occupied the concession, and the "Thrift and Save the Nation Association" was dissolved. In February 1943, Maya planned to establish a new factory in Tianjin, and Tao was sent to work in Tianjin. Because he had not obtained the consent of the Communist Party in advance, he broke off relations with the Communist Party during this period. At the beginning of 1945, he returned to Shanghai, left Maya, and invested with friends to set up a silk factory in Suzhou. However, due to problems with power, the factory was closed without production, causing a lot of losses, and Tao also lost his job as a result. In the spring of 1945, he met personnel from the Communist Party's "Transportation Company" (an organization that escorted party members from the occupied areas to the "Liberated Areas") in Suzhou, who invited him to go to the "Liberated Areas" for training. Tao happily agreed and was sent to Xinpu Town near Liuhe, Anhui, to receive training at the "Construction University." On August 11 of the same year, Japan surrendered, and he was sent to sneak into Shanghai to work, leading the Third District Silk Weaving Union to launch labor strikes. After the grand parade to send Ma Xulun to Beijing to petition in the summer of the year before last, the senior Communist Party leaders believed that Tao's performance was too blatant and dangerous, and ordered him to temporarily hide and wait for the opportunity to sneak back to the "Liberated Area" for further training. However, Tao believed that there was no need for this and refused to obey. Therefore, the Communist Party was very dissatisfied with him. Tao's thinking also gradually developed a good impression of the Kuomintang because he was in contact with government agencies every day. He officially joined the Kuomintang last year. When the security authorities cracked down on the secret organs of the Communist Party this time, they planned to arrest him based on the roster. After receiving the news, Tao hid in the home of a friend at Lequn Middle School, Xinzha Road, for four days. After repeated consideration, he decided to surrender. Finally, Tao expressed his gratitude to the government for its leniency and said that he would be loyal to the Kuomintang in the future.

### Adulterer Coerces Loan: Husband Commits Assault Out of Jealousy

[Our Newspaper's Report] Jiang Zhaoshun, a rickshaw puller, 28 years old, from Jiangbei, lives at No. 106, Mei Jiaqiao, Dong Zhuanbang, Jiangsu Road. Seven years ago, he married Liu Ying (24 years old), a woman from his hometown, and came to Shanghai together, raising two sons. Four or five years ago, due to the war, Jiang worked as a casual laborer and often left home to work. Wang Yian, a 32-year-old barber from Funing, who worked at No. 50 nearby, seduced Liu Ying when he came to her house, and they had an affair.

At about 4:00 PM on the 12th, Wang went to Jiang's wife again to force her to borrow 2 million yuan, but was refused. Soon after, he came again and was caught by Jiang, who became jealous and drove him away, and scolded his wife for being shameless. Liu was furious and went to her lover to question him. Jiang chased after her with a kitchen knife, intending to intimidate Liu into returning home. When Jiang also arrived at Wang's place, he saw Liu grabbing Wang's collar. Jiang was furious and slashed Wang's head four times with the knife, causing heavy bleeding. He was detained by his neighbor Wang Xiaodi and others who came by, and the police were called to take him and the murder weapon to the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau. The sub-bureau charged Jiang with attempted murder and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The injured person was taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

### Allocation of Working Capital Loans to Cotton Merchants for Cotton Purchasing, Simplified Procedures by the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee

Optimistic Outlook on Cotton Purchases

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the progress of the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee's entrusted cotton purchasing work by cotton merchants, our reporter paid another visit to Liu Pingsun, Chairman of the Cotton Merchants Association, yesterday. According to him, following previous suggestions to the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee, the committee has been discussing simplifying procedures for days, and satisfactory results have been achieved. The difficulty previously felt by cotton merchants lay in the time spent on receiving working capital loans. This was due to the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee's vast operations and numerous internal departments. Loan allocation matters required careful consideration and had to go through various relevant departments for layer-by-layer verification, which inevitably took time. Now, after consultation among the relevant departments, to encourage cotton merchants to actively purchase cotton, it has been decided that each of the three offices responsible for allocating working capital loans—Finance, Accounting, and Auditing—will send one staff member to work permanently in the Procurement and Transportation Department. This aims to expedite the review and approval procedures in the same location and at the same time. However, cotton merchants handling these matters must arrive at the committee no later than 2:00 PM each day to avoid delays. Those arriving after 2:00 PM will have to wait until the next day. With this reform, the difficulties faced by cotton merchants should be resolved smoothly, which will greatly benefit future purchasing efforts. Furthermore, the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee's cotton purchases have been quite robust in recent days, and the committee is optimistic about the future of cotton purchasing.

### Market Conditions Still Precarious in Other Areas, Cotton Yarn Market Listless, Outside Merchants Reduce Inventory, Narrow Fluctuations in Grey Cloth

Yesterday's cotton yarn market remained sluggish. Due to precarious yarn prices in other areas, outside merchants adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and all stalls opened at lower prices. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 228 million, briefly falling to 227 million during the session. As closing approached, weaving mills slightly increased demand, gradually strengthening, and ultimately closing at 230 million, a decline of 3 million. Bao Guang and Yue Shui also dropped by around 2 million. 40-count Blue Phoenix and 32-count Silver Moon, which were selling well locally, generally rose by 1 million to 2 million. 12-count Double Horse only saw slight interest from front-row merchants, with a very stable trend and narrow fluctuations, opening at 141 million and closing at 143 million, a further decrease of 2 million. 20-count, except for Duo Bao, Da Fa, and Cai Wu Zi, which marginally increased, all others fell by 1 million to 3 million.

Cotton cloth saw narrow fluctuations yesterday. Shirting and colored twill fabrics were being supplied and sold smoothly by dyeing factories, but sales to outside merchants on this street remained stagnant, and prices were weak. Northern and Guangdong merchants were trading with each other. Hankou merchants stationed in Shanghai were buying bleached cloth, and prices remained firm. Gray broadcloth from umbrella factories saw brisk business. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company's purchase permits for small printed cotton cloth were selling at a loss of 20,000, with few buyers.

Textile Construction Yarn Sales

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Construction Company sold 13 types of cotton yarn as usual yesterday (the 14th). There were a total of 400 purchase applications, and 1,103 pieces of yarn were sold, equivalent to 1,780 pieces of 20-count yarn.

The opening prices for each yarn were as follows: 20-count Golden Rooster, 125 million; 6-count Deputy Sunlight, 66 million; 8-count Sunlight, 69 million; 10-count Li Ma, 71 million; 16-count Red Moon, 95 million; 32-count Yang He, 154 million; 32-count Double-Strand Immortal Peach, 178 million.

40-count Blue Phoenix, 180 million; 40-count TK Color Ball, 233 million; 42-count Double-Strand Blue Phoenix, 225 million; 60-count Sunlight, 235 million; 60-count Double-Strand Sunlight Singed, 310 million; 100-count Double-Strand Sunlight Singed, 400 million.

### Rayon Silk Market Continues to Weaken

Yesterday's rayon silk market continued to weaken. Besides weaving, all other goods were weak. Furthermore, with the silk market shrinking again, sentiment became even more fragile. 120-count Tian Qiao New Loan initially stood at 230 million, but outside merchants sold at high prices, falling as low as 227 million. As the midday session approached, there was a slight rebound, ultimately closing at 229 million, a further decrease of 4 million. Dong Yang and Jin San Ma also dropped by around 4 million.

Yesterday morning, the silk market continued to show weakness. Da Cheng bedspreads opened at 140.2 million, then gradually declined to 138.4 million, ultimately closing at 239.2 million, another decrease of 1.8 million. Bi Crepe saw few offers, with limited transactions. Rumors of silk allocation in the market led to a downturn in sentiment and a price decline. The morning opening price for CD level was 345 million, with five bundles traded at the midday close, with the initial offer price at seven bundles, priced at 340 million. Hand-spun silk also softened by 5 million. Regarding exports, it is rumored that the China Silk Company will have a batch of transactions with Myanmar, which is currently under negotiation.

The Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that the maximum amount of cash that each person could carry from the mainland to Guangzhou was 50 million. It is now understood that this restriction has been applied to the entire Guangdong Province, and the Jianghai Customs officially announced its implementation yesterday.

The measures restricting the use of bills as collateral will be officially implemented on the 15th. However, as of the 14th, no banks or businesses had reported their handling of collateral matters to the Bureau of Banking Supervision.

The morning opening was flat and sluggish. The expected foreign exchange adjustment failed to materialize. Yong Yarn opened low at 1,820 yuan, rose to a high price of 1,885 yuan, and gradually declined. There were very few transactions in the middle of the session, and outside stimulation greatly reduced.

### The Purpose of Parliament

— Chu Yukun

(The Purpose of Parliament, by Quintin Hogg, Blandford Press. 198 pages, ten shillings and sixpence.)

Britain is the birthplace of modern democracy. Although it still maintains a constitutional monarchy, all political systems, whether central or local, and all domestic and foreign policy decisions must be decided by Parliament. Parliament is the highest organ of the state. On the positive side, it determines major national policies and submits them to the government for execution. On the negative side, it supervises the government to ensure that it does not infringe on the basic rights of the people and does not increase their suffering. Therefore, the power of the British Parliament surpasses everything, even more so than that of the United States Congress.

Today, the National Assembly of our country is meeting in the capital, and the Legislative Yuan will also hold its first meeting. Mr. Hertley of the Sino-British Cultural Association sent me three books, "The Purpose of Parliament," "The House of Commons," and "The People and the Government," asking me to recommend them to readers. I feel that China's politics has just taken the first step towards democratic governance and is still in the kindergarten stage of learning democracy. Apart from working hard to learn, everything else is nonsense. Last year, I believed that the most important task for China's constitutionalism was to make the people understand the content and spirit of the Constitution. I specially wrote a "Outline of the Chinese Constitution" and published it by the Zhonghua Book Company as a university textbook, but it is not suitable for the general public to read. After reading "The Purpose of Parliament" and "The House of Commons," I deeply feel that our publishing industry should also publish some popular booklets on the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan, so that the general public can understand how our national public opinion organs operate. If someone adopts my suggestion, then these three booklets are worth introducing.

"The Purpose of Parliament" is less than two hundred pages long, but its content is divided into twenty-four chapters. The first chapter, "The Origin of Parliament," divides the development of the British Parliament into five stages, evolving into today's Parliament. From this, it can be seen that today's British Parliament is the result of natural development and also the price paid by the people for fighting for democracy. The second chapter, "The Seat of Parliament," states that the British Parliament building has been destroyed by fire four times since the 13th century. The last time was in May 1941, when it was bombed by German planes, causing a major fire. The House of Commons chamber was completely destroyed and needs to be rebuilt. The House of Lords chamber was unharmed, and the House of Commons always holds meetings in the House of Lords chamber. The third chapter, "The King," the fourth chapter, "The House of Lords," and the fifth chapter, "The House of Commons," clearly explain the relationship between the head of state and the Parliament.

The seventh chapter, "The Privileges of Parliament," the eighth chapter, "The Powers of Parliament," and the ninth chapter, "The Cabinet," analyze the actual operation of British politics in detail. From this, we can see that Britain adopts a responsible cabinet system, in which the cabinet has joint responsibility to the Parliament. The cabinet must obtain the trust of the Parliament; otherwise, the cabinet has only two options: either dissolve the Parliament or resign voluntarily. This is completely different from the presidential system in the United States.

The tenth chapter, "Political Parties," and the eleventh chapter, "The Opposition Party," explain the origin of political parties, the rise of the Labour Party, party discipline and policies, and the relationship between the ruling party and the opposition party, pointing out that allowing criticism from the opposition party is a driving force for promoting political progress, which deserves our attention the most.

Chapter 12, "The Civil Service," Chapter 13, "The Publication of Parliamentary News," Chapter 14, "Elections of Members of Parliament," Chapter 15, "Basic Procedures," Chapter 17, "The Passage of Bills," Chapter 18, "The Opening and Recess of Parliament," and Chapter 20, "Past and Present Views of Parliament," are all limited by space and cannot be introduced in detail.

The last chapter, "A World Parliament?" raises a question that deserves our attention. The author believes that the United Nations Charter is not enough to constitute a free world government. He says, "A government must have a legislative body to make laws, an executive body to enforce laws, and a judicial body to implement laws. And the United Nations is just a permanent peace conference, and every strong country has the power to exercise veto power." (See page 188) The author's opinion is worthy of our study.

### Eternal Remembrance

— Sun Panshou

(Written by Feng Zikai, et al. Dahong Bookstore, first edition, February 1937)

The recently published "Eternal Remembrance" by Dawie Books is a collection of essays, included in the "Dahong Literature Series," collecting several articles written by Feng Zikai, Ye Shengtao, Shi Zhicun, Yang Tongfang, Fu Binran, Ren Lun, Zhong Jiyu, Qin Sheng, and others to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the death of Master Hongyi (the artist Li Shutong).

Before becoming a monk, Master Hongyi was highly regarded for his calligraphy, painting, poetry, and prose. He studied in Japan in his early years, participated in the revolution, and devoted himself to art and teaching after returning to China. He was a scholar with lofty ideals and did not follow the crowd. After becoming a monk, he devoted himself to practicing the Brahma way, and was even more respected as a great monk of his generation.

Reading this book makes us have an irresistible longing for Master Hongyi. It is not due to the power of religion, because none of the authors purely regarded Master Hongyi as a great monk, nor did they regard him as a superhuman. As the preface says, he was very ordinary, "commemorating his ordinariness, not commemorating his brilliance." I think his ordinary life, which was full of humanity, showed his greatness.

Feng Zikai's "Speaking of Master Hongyi for Young People" is both sentimental and well-written. It looks simple and unadorned, but it is very thought-provoking when studied carefully. The author was a senior student of Master Hongyi before he became a monk, so he knew a lot about Master Hongyi's life, so he spoke very sincerely. The article describes the teaching situation of Master Hongyi in detail, and his sincere and serious attitude is really admirable. In the end, he praised his immortal personality and moral achievements.

Ye Shengtao's "Talking about Master Hongyi's Death Verses" has a profound intention. He said, "Master Hongyi wrote two verses before his death. The last two sentences of the second verse are 'The branches are full of spring and the sky is full of moon'. In my opinion, this is a description of his life and an explanation of his life experience; he entered the world once, experienced all kinds of things, and studied all kinds of things. When he was about to die, it was when the spring was full and the moon was round. This is naturally a good death, but a good death comes from a good life." These words are nothing more than stating that the most important thing for a person is his own attitude towards life.

Yang Tongfang's "Learning the Educational Spirit of Master Hongyi" and Fu Binran's "Returning from the Fifth Anniversary Memorial Meeting of Master Hongyi's Passing" both praise Master Hongyi's educational spirit when he was a layman. His teaching attitude was so sincere and kind, easy-going and meticulous. Indeed, Master Hongyi is truly worthy of being a great "teacher"!

Shi Yicun's "Praise of Master Hongyi" is elegant in diction, praising Master Hongyi's courage and wisdom, which is expressed from truly understanding his mood and ambition.

Other articles such as Zhong Jiyu's "Reminiscence" and Qin Sheng's "Inspiration of Spirit and Practice" will make us further understand Master Hongyi's enthusiasm for saving the world and his spirit of practicing what he preached. Ren Lun's "If Master Hongyi Were Still Alive" is full of infinite emotion and indignation. Yes, the current social atmosphere and this land, the national fortune is so declining, if the compassionate Master Hongyi is still alive, can he not cry bitterly?

In a society full of tricks, fraud, harm, hatred, indifference, and insidiousness, we need to see a little light, heat, love, justice, and sympathy. From the life of this rare philosopher, we should get a great feeling!

### The Complete Book of Music

— Rong Juzhen

(B. Cyclopedia of Music & Musicians, Fourth Edition, 1946)

In recent years, due to the popularity of radio receivers, the opportunities for Chinese people to appreciate Western music have increased a lot. Modern young people not only know famous dance music such as "The Blue Danube" and "Wine, Women, and Song," but even more classical works such as "Unfinished Symphony" and "Hungarian Rhapsody" are also warmly welcomed. This is really a good phenomenon in the music world. The moon in the West is certainly not rounder than the moon in China, but the superiority of Western music is an undeniable fact.

The understanding of music, of course, mostly relies on the training of hearing, and cannot be fully inspired by the knowledge in books. But true music researchers and appreciators seem to have to rely on the help of books. If we do not acquire the knowledge of Carmen from books, do not know how Carmen falls in love with people, and do not know how Carmen is killed, and rashly go to listen to the musical drama Carmen, then our understanding of the music will be discounted at least. The above example can prove the importance of book knowledge.

Based on the above understanding, I am providing a rather complete music reference book here, which is also the topic of this article—"The Complete Book of Music." This book is edited by the American musician Thompson Zuren, and the contributors include not only famous musicians and scholars in the American music world, but also composers, music educators, conductors, and music critics from Germany, France, Italy, and other European countries. The editors selected the most essential and applicable manuscripts from the submissions from all parties and compiled them into this booklet. Therefore, each item is written by the most appropriate person to write the most essential manuscript, so this book has become a unique work in the music world.

The nature and content of the Complete Book of Music, of course, belong to the category of dictionaries. The knowledge about music can be said to be all-inclusive and very complete. Generally speaking, we can divide its content into three categories: (1) theory, (2) history, and (3) biography. The theoretical and historical aspects are relatively dull materials, and the fluency of the narrative and the correctness of the explanation are certainly worthy of praise. But my focus is not on these, but on the last item, which is the biographies of musicians. Musical works, like other arts, are the expression of the author's thoughts and feelings. He pours pure thoughts and feelings into the music, making his work a bridge between the author and the audience. Therefore, the thoughts and feelings of musicians will resonate with the audience. For people who want to truly understand musical works, the biographies of musicians cannot be ignored. Otherwise, we will have no way of knowing the musician's personal life, social environment, ideological background, etc., which are the decisive factors in completing the music. In these biographies, we can also learn about the musician's state of mind, wisdom, and methods when creating the music; whether his work has an original style or is imitated; what the status of his work was at the time, and what the impact on future generations. The above-mentioned knowledge should be of great help to the understanding and appreciation of musical works. In the dozens of biographies in this Complete Book of Music, we can see the above-mentioned points, which are explained concisely and thoroughly. Whether it is a musician, music teacher, or ordinary audience, as long as they are truly interested in music, they will definitely get spiritual satisfaction when reading these biographies. A simple chronology and catalog of works are also attached to the end of these biographies, making it extra convenient for readers to browse. One more thing worth mentioning is that the characteristics of the musician are sometimes indicated by a few words in the biography. For example, for Mozart's works, the three words Brightness, Gaity, and Serenity are used. What an appropriate judgment! We should not listen to any of Mozart's works, whether it is a symphony, concerto, or string quartet. If we have the opportunity to listen to it, we will immediately feel the bright, joyful, and solemn musical style. —The Complete Book of Music is indeed a valuable publication, and there is a reason for it.

If domestic music educators can take some time to collectively translate this valuable book, it will be a great contribution to readers (or listeners) who do not understand foreign languages.

### The Three Great Problems of Geometry

— Li Musun

(Written by Klein, translated by Yu Jieshi, Commercial Press)

Some time ago, it was rumored that Mr. Yang Jiaru, an accountant at a local store, had invented a solution to one of the three great problems of geometry, the trisection of an arbitrary angle. It was really amazing, and many newspapers cited it as the light of Chinese mathematics. But in fact, higher mathematics has already told us that this is impossible, and besides, Mr. Yang's solution has many loopholes. For example, he said that the locus of the trisection point is actually an arc, but we all know that the locus of the trisection point is the trisector line, which is a straight line rather than other curves.

This "Three Great Problems of Geometry" discusses the three great problems of geometry in detail—namely, the duplication of the cube, also known as the Delian Problem, the trisection of an arbitrary angle, and the squaring of the circle—and at the same time clearly proves that these three problems are impossible to solve, not difficult to solve. It tells us that what can be solved by geometric methods (that is, only using a compass and a straightedge) are quadratic equations, and these three problems are cubic equations, so no matter how you start, it is impossible. Unless it is a special angle, such as a straight angle, a right angle, etc. In fact, there are more than three geometric problems, and thousands of cubic equation problems are unsolvable, and they are all difficult problems. In addition to the three major problems, this book also discusses the solutions to many other interesting problems, such as the construction of a regular heptadecagon, the approximation of π, and the transcendence of e. I dare say that as long as you read this book carefully, you will definitely have a great interest in geometry.

The author of this book, Professor Felix Clein, is a famous professor of mathematics in Germany. The purpose of writing this book is not only to discuss the three great problems of geometry. He tells me that learning mathematics is inseparable from algebra and geometry, because these three geometric problems could not be solved for thousands of years until modern times, thanks to the help of analytical methods, that it was possible to prove that they are impossible to solve.

Finally, I tell you readers that this book is quite advanced, because the knowledge of elementary mathematics alone is definitely not enough. This book has cited advanced algebra and analytical geometry and other profound mathematics, so to read this book: First, you must have a good mathematical foundation; second, you should read it carefully rather than skim it, so that you can achieve the effect of "opening a book and benefiting."

### A Doctor's Confession

— Wei Yuan

Written by V. Veresaev, Translated by Zhen Jiang, Published by Kaiming

Someone once said that a doctor's subject is "the patient." It's "disease" and "person," not just "disease" alone. Well, I say that "A Doctor's Confession" provides a very profound, clear, and straightforward explanation of these principles.

The core of the book is succinctly portrayed in the translator's "Introduction to the Author's Personality and Works" at the beginning: "The content narrates his observations and experiences during his time at medical university and the years following graduation as a practicing doctor. Through his pen, one can glimpse the capabilities of modern medicine, the level of doctors, the psychology of patients towards doctors, the attitude of society towards doctors, and the attitude of doctors towards the patient and society. He observes everything with keen eyes and a sensitive heart, considering everything thoroughly. Then, with the attitude of 'speaking publicly about public matters; speaking privately about matters without personal bias,' he exposes every aspect of the dark side to the best of his ability, allowing everyone to understand the complex relationships between doctors, patients, and society."

Generally speaking, the first part of the book describes how the author entered the door of new medicine, how he was cleansed by new medicine within its walls, how he recognized new medicine, and how he strived to understand new medicine from blood and corpses. To understand this, we only need to read chapters like "Student Life and the Society Seen by Medical Students," "The Pain of Various Illnesses," "Praise and Disappointment Regarding Medicine," and "The Imperfection of Medical Education." We can then know how the author uses a light yet incisive tone to write about everything he encountered within the doors of new medicine, as well as the extraordinary things he touched upon, saw clearly, through his in-depth observations and thoughts.

Throughout, the author reveals genuine emotion. Sometimes we laugh while reading, and then our emotions plunge into an atmosphere of pain; sometimes we seem lost on our journey, but immediately we find answers and a way forward.

The second part describes how the author, outside the school gates among the masses, used everything he learned at school to confront everything. I think this part is more worth reading than the first, and it is more likely to inspire many insights:

Without mentioning anything else, we can first look at the chapter "Civilization and the Human Body." In addition to citing many examples to illustrate the fact that "humanity should enjoy the benefits of civilization without destroying the harmony of nature," the author also describes his own methods of maintaining health. He said, "Until the year I graduated from university, I spent every summer living as a manual laborer, plowing, harvesting, or felling trees in the mountains. I know what happiness comes from muscle fatigue, what it is like to eat like a wolf, how sweet deep sleep is, and how little the wind and weather are to be feared. Even today, if I have the opportunity to go to the fields, I will still bring an axe. Only when my hands are calloused, my body is strong, and I deeply feel the true joy of life," The author has written out the theme that a doctor should write to those outside of his profession, or all that he should write to the society around him. Although some people may not have experienced such things, they must personally experience them. Because these should be everyone's concern — not just doctors.

Additionally, I think the chapter "Women's Shame and Doctors" is also extremely well-written. This is a type of writing rarely seen elsewhere. Regarding "Women's Shame and Female Doctors," the author is pointing out a path to be developed for future generations, an important path.

Finally, the author writes several chapters on doctors and money, which I think everyone should read. In particular, I feel that the chapters "The Sound of Money Between Doctors and Patients" and "The Obligations of Stringent Doctors" accurately portray the misunderstandings of countless people and the voices of countless hearts. The author does not defend doctors; on the contrary, he defends the poor with a detached attitude, reserving his merciless condemnation only for greedy and stingy dignitaries.

In this book, the author indeed uniquely reveals the depths of many things that people often encounter but never think about, and his writing style is so subtle that it does not make people feel like they are reading a book with a strong scientific flavor. Reader Zhu Zhenjiang is also a giant in this field, so this translation can be so perfect. Of course, Mr. Zhu also has a great relationship.

I dare to recommend this book to: doctors who have not read it, future doctors preparing to practice medicine. Of course, I should recommend it even more to: anyone outside the medical circle.

Free Talk

### On Freedom of the Press

— Jing Wen

In the successive meetings of the International Press Conference in Geneva this time, not only the issue of freedom of the press itself was discussed, but also the freedom of thought and expression of thought and meaning were widely discussed. This is indeed an issue that interests all freedom-loving people around the world.

I remember that the late US President Franklin D. Roosevelt once included freedom of the press as one of the four freedoms of mankind. This is indeed the greatness of Roosevelt as a politician. Because to this day, the importance of the press to human life has been universally recognized. Its impact on human civilization can be said to be above any cultural undertaking. The so-called newspaper is the spiritual food of the masses, which is certainly no empty word.

However, although the press has a significant impact on human life, whether it is meritorious or criminal is still an unresolved issue. For example, at this Geneva press conference, the United States and the Soviet Union both had proposals regarding the policy of the press. The Soviet Union advocated that all news belonging to fascist ideology and encouraging war ideology should be stopped and absolutely not published, while the US proposal requested "the cessation of the continued official propagation of false or distorted reports sufficient to increase hatred or promote prejudice against countries, individuals, or groups of different races, languages, religions, or philosophical beliefs." These two proposals, which seem the same at first glance but are actually different, are known to informed people as having their own political backgrounds. But generally speaking, they all illustrate that the world's press still lacks a truly sound foundation to date.

So-called freedom of the press naturally includes freedom of expression of thought, because although news must be based on facts, the reporting of news must pass through the expression of thought and meaning. Regarding the expression of human thought and meaning, it is not limited to journalistic work. All poetry, literature, philosophy, and plastic arts such as painting and sculpture are tools or crystallization of human thought and meaning. However, because of the technical relationship of the press, the freedom of expression of thought related to the press is the representative issue of all freedom of expression of thought today.

Since news cannot be separated from the basis of certain facts, the so-called freedom of expression of thought in news also has certain limits. Freedom of thought is only a relative concept. The realm of freedom of thought can only expand with the expansion of human intellect. For example, after his theory of relativity, Einstein recently made new discoveries about the relationship between gravitation and electrons. According to the opinions of general scientists, this new knowledge will have a more important impact on the future world than atomic energy. However, to date, there are not many people who can understand this new knowledge, even among high-level scientific experts. Therefore, although Einstein's realm of thought has reached almost the level of paralleling the universe itself, most people are still lagging behind. This is an empirical evidence of the relative relationship between freedom of thought and intellect.

However, this cannot be used as an excuse for the issue of freedom of expression of thought in news. Because in terms of the intellect of modern people, although it cannot be said to be high to what extent, if there are no external constraints, human thought and expression of meaning can obtain free development. The problem now is how to enable the freedom of expression of thought in news to obtain a reasonable foundation. Mr. Hugh Baillie, President of United Press, said in a broadcast address in Geneva on the 3rd of this month that this international conference is striving for a Magna Carta on freedom of the press to serve as the foundation for the world's press. Although I am not a member of the press, I sincerely hope that this move will be successful.

Although there are various external obstacles to the freedom of news and expression of thought at present, the most important thing is that members of the press can improve their professional morality and sense of social responsibility. Because the meaning of the so-called freedom of expression of thought is relative, as already said. The word "expression" itself is not a simple technical issue but a thought issue. A person who knows how to expand their realm of thought in the cultivation of intellect will not think that external conditions may hinder the freedom of expression of their thought. Therefore, in addition to opening up external conditions, the more important thing in striving for the freedom of news and expression of thought is to expand the intellectual realm of members of the press themselves.

In the proposal submitted to the conference by my country's representative, Dr. Zhang Pengchun, there is a clause that requires improving the morality and social responsibility of the journalistic profession, rejecting commercialism and sensationalism, eliminating racial and religious prejudice, and engaging in accurate, objective, and clear reporting work. No one can oppose these propositions, but to achieve this, it is necessary to start by strengthening the intellectual cultivation of journalists.

### Hangzhou People's View of Shanghai Tourists

— Yun Geng

In these few days, Shanghai tourists are pouring into paradise like a tide, batch after batch. According to informal statistics from the police station, at least 40,000 tourists stay in this small city center every day. The government officials, merchants, and coolies of Hangzhou are sincerely welcoming these tourists, because most Shanghai tourists are great consumers. They not only directly increase the income of merchants and coolies, but also indirectly increase government tax revenue, thereby solving financial difficulties. Therefore, some people say: Shanghai tourists are happy, because in Hangzhou, in addition to being in West Lake and enjoying the intoxication of the fragrant lake breeze, they can also win the general welcome and envy of Hangzhou people.

But it is not entirely like this. In Hangzhou, there are at least two types of people who deeply resent and hate Shanghai tourists; and there is a type of people who are indifferent to the arrival of Shanghai tourists, and do not know whether it is good or bad.

Among the two types of people who deeply resent Shanghai tourists, the first is housewives. Prices have been relatively stable in the past few days, but the feeling in the vegetable market seems to be particularly sensitive. Not only fish and shrimp need to be snatched, but also pork, which has a stable price on weekdays, has also jumped greatly. Housewives are responsible for purchasing goods in the kitchen, and the sharp rise in vegetables in the past few days has made them feel tricky when purchasing goods, so they blame this evil on this temporary consumer group — Shanghai tourists. The second is the general salaried public school staff, although they are on West Lake, but they rarely have the opportunity to visit the lake or climb the mountain on weekdays, most of which are due to economic reasons. This type of people does not dislike Shanghai tourists, but in fact jealousy makes them resentful.

Another type of people, probably belonging to the general small property owners class of men, are not directly affected by the rise in vegetable prices due to the large increase in consumption in life, because this is a matter for their wives; at the same time, they are not jealous of the extravagance of Shanghai tourists, but they do not necessarily welcome them. The general attitude is: it is good to come, it is good not to come.

However, although Hangzhou people's attitudes towards Shanghai tourists are different, there is one point of view that is completely the same, that is, they are rich and extravagant. Almost every Hangzhou person thinks that Shanghai tourists are rich, and the amount of money is so much that it is amazing! As for extravagance, it is because they have money. Those who have money are naturally extravagant, so it seems not surprising that extravagance is reflected in Shanghai tourists.

But there are also many people who think that the extravagance of Shanghai tourists is a bit too much. The so-called "too much" means acting like a "fool". In fact, it does not matter if the rich temporarily act like a fool, just like the boatmen said: "Sir, three winters rely on one spring, it is rare". Because it is rare, it is okay to temporarily act like a "cucumber". However, most Hangzhou people think that it is completely unnecessary to act like a cucumber sometimes. The so-called "when you enter the country, ask about customs", the hearts of the people in Hangzhou are not bad after all. If tourists can plan ahead for travel, accommodation, food, and play, we can guarantee that certain places will never act like a "cucumber".

Another point is that it seems unnecessary for Shanghai people to visit West Lake in the spring. Although there are various reasons to lure tourists in the spring, during this period, sightseeing must be crowded in the sea of people, and eating and accommodation may not be comfortable. At the same time, the scenery of West Lake in the autumn, such as the osmanthus flowers in Manjuelong and the sugarcane flowers in Xixi, also has a unique charm, and why can't it intoxicate the hearts of tourists? Therefore, in the view of Hangzhou people, why not divide half of the Shanghai tourists to come and play again after the autumn is cool? Wouldn't it make the various distributions more average?

### Random Thoughts

— Ru Zi

Retain the freedom to suspect everything miserably, and never fall into the trap of any "dogma". — Turgenev

The accumulated wounds are the best things life gives you, because each wound marks a step forward. — Romain Rolland

A good book is a precious collection of the good heart and blood of a great soul, its purpose is to leave it to posterity. — Milton

### The Ingenious Thief

— Mao Yi

Many missing treasures are not necessarily buried at the bottom of the sea or underground. Maybe they are placed in a box on the attic that has long been forgotten; maybe they are right in front of you, but separated by a board. Look at the experience of Franklin Schradle, known as the "Treasure Detective King of America," and you will know that "getting it without any effort" is not false.

A seventy-year-old woman died in an apartment in New York. Her relatives knew that she had a considerable inheritance, but unfortunately they didn't know where it was hidden. They searched through the small two-room apartment for two months, but still found nothing. Schradle was invited, and it only took him five minutes to find a secret drawer in an old trunk, which contained nearly $500,000 in cash.

Schradle specializes in designing, manufacturing, selling, and repairing boxes, accumulating more than 30 years of experience. He also specializes in finding hidden drawers in furniture and secret compartments in old houses. Not long ago, a man remembered that his family had a box of letters written to his ancestors by Washington, but he couldn't find where it was hidden. After Schradle entered the house and took a look, he felt that the paintings hanging on the wall were a bit strange, among which a portrait of Washington was the most suspicious. He took the painting down and found the precious letters hidden between the canvas and the frame. Collectors believe that this bundle of letters is worth 25,000 US dollars.

During the war, Schradle did something special. An American ambassador to a neutral country stayed at a hotel on Park Street in New York on his way to his post. A spy followed and searched not only the ambassador's room, but also pried open the locks of more than 150 pieces of luggage deposited by other travelers in the luggage room. Although he did not steal anything, the hotel authorities did not want the travelers to know about this matter. They secretly hired Schradle to be responsible for the work of fitting the locks. With his superb skills, Schradle actually made the travelers not know that their locks had been replaced, which can be regarded as an expert who "steals the sky and replaces the sun".

### Small Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Old people scold young people for "not listening to the words of the old", but young people say that the lessons of the old are equal to lies, because they have never frankly guided the later generations with some precious experience; — they are afraid that someone will be smarter than themselves because of this.

The green mountains remain unchanged because they are indifferent.

The green water flows for a long time because it never looks back.

### Spring Outing

— Shi Shufan

On Qingming Festival, I traveled with Sanmu to Nanxiang. The smoke on the road was cold, very different from before the war. Later, I visited Guyi Garden, where the walls and houses were destroyed, and the stones were also eroded. The handwritings of Nanmu Hall and Dong Qichang's "Huayan Ink Sea" are only for future generations to remember. Although two new pavilions have been built, they still cannot hide the desolate atmosphere of the entire garden. I have an old sentence: "The trees also sigh with the wind and are full of emotions, and the crows seem to be telling the vicissitudes of life as guests." Now the spring grass is not recorded, what about the trees?

Lonely calf art bridge side, peach blossoms fade and willows wither, the world has forgotten, three or two mounds of paper ashes are cold, six states of complexion are rapeseed yellow. Who can melt iron into spring rain? I also have no home to rely on in the distance. The ancient affairs of recommending wine and steamed pigs, now people and ghosts are all in a state of anxiety.

Casually looking at the flowers and plants to avoid the common people, cloth socks are still suitable for short trips. A river is completely dry and is not a beautiful field. Although this garden is small, it is a barren city. It must be known that the stone fell with the tears of the three dynasties, and there is no sound of crows perched on ten thousand trees! I look forward to the year when the green is turned again, and the Jiangnan mourning ode passes through Lan Cheng.

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14: Carefree on the Sea (126)

Qian Qi leaned on the iron railing, quietly watching for a while, suddenly heard someone whistling behind him. Looking back, there were two or three old men, holding canes in their hands, walking and opening their mouths to whistle. Zhu Zhai knew that these people were all health enthusiasts, welcoming the sunlight in the park and exercising their bodies. After they came, the quiet environment was disturbed by the constant whistling sound, so Zhu Zhai was unwilling to stay here. He passed through the ancient cypresses and walked straight to the door of the Jesuits Coffee Shop. Looking at the red wall opposite, the flowers were shining. Hundreds of peach trees along the wall were all in full bloom. His spirit could not help but be refreshed, and he hurried to the peach forest to admire it carefully. He saw the peach blossoms on the trees, with the buds just opening, delicate and beautiful. He remembered that he had met Qi Wan on that day, right here. Qi Wan's face, that pair of dimples, her charming smile, was no different from the delicate beauty of these peach blossoms. Now the flowers are still in bloom, but the beauty has gone. While thinking about it, he walked to the corner of the red wall, thinking that he had practiced his voice here that day, met Xiao Bai, and Qi Wan was introduced by Xiao Bai. In this year, they had been in love with each other, inseparable. He never thought that today they would be separated in the south and the north, each in his own place. Facing these peach blossoms and this red wall, he felt a sense of "the face is unknown where to go, the peach blossoms still smile in the east wind." He couldn't help but feel melancholy. He wandered in the peach forest for a long time, and he really wanted to leave this sad place, but to this trace, he also wanted to relive the old dream in his heart. He wandered and lingered, only walking back and forth in the peach forest, unwilling to leave. He thought of Qi Wan's little sister for a while, and then he thought of Qi Wan's little Wang's mother. These were all mediums for meeting Qi Wan that day. Finally, he thought of the fact that he had practiced his voice here that day and sang a section of "Yu Tang Chun". He hadn't practiced his voice for a long time now. He didn't know how his voice was, so why not take advantage of this morning, when there were few tourists, and try his voice? Thinking of this, he walked into the forest and still found the place where he had practiced his voice that day, facing the red wall, and sang at the top of his voice. Just after singing a section of "Wang Tang Chun", he turned around and saw someone laughing at him under the peach tree. When Zhu Zhai looked at it, it was none other than Xiao Bai's uncle. Unexpectedly, Xiao Bai smiled and waved to him. Zhu Zhai hurried over. Xiao Bai smiled and said, "It's rare that you came out to practice your voice again. I originally wanted to find your father, but now that I've met you, I can save myself a trip. I'll tell you good news. Qi Wan's performance in Shanghai is very smooth. She gave me a letter and a letter to your grandfather. I originally wanted to send the letter in person, but now I'll give it to you." Saying that, he took out two letters and handed them to Zhu Zhai. When Qian Qi heard that Qi Wan had a letter, his heart had already been pounding. He couldn't care about greeting Xiao Bai anymore. He took the letter and quickly unfolded it to read it.

### Talking about Lu Zhengxiang (Part 1)

— Qingxue Academy

Having described the martial artist General Sa, who has the temperament of the mountains and forests, it is even more impossible to neglect Lu Zhengxiang, the extraordinary figure in the diplomatic world who is famous internationally, has shouldered many major events, and is most closely related to the fate of China.

He is the leader of "loyalty" and the leader of "treachery". He has served as the Premier, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and special envoy and minister. Before the 1920s, he was a globally renowned figure. For the past 20 years, he has been silent and traceless. He has devoted himself to a Belgian monastery and become an ascetic monk, a recluse from the world. He is truly suffering and truly reclusive, compared to the other bureaucratic warlords who burned incense and recited Buddha, such as Zhu Rengeng, Wang Yitang, and Sun Chuanfang, the distinction between sincerity and hypocrisy cannot be measured by reason? The ancient saying "the divine dragon sees its head but not its tail" and "extreme brilliance returns to plainness" are not enough to describe his unique character and nature.

Why is he called the leader of "loyalty"? We must remember that in 1918, at the Paris Peace Conference, Japan wanted to formally include the acceptance of Shandong's rights into the treaty, bullying our country too much. Domestically, there was the historic "May Fourth Movement". At that time, many old bureaucrats in Beijing advocated accommodation out of fear of Japan; that is, the international situation, because Japan had already established agreements with European countries during the war, agreeing to her inheritance of German rights. As a result, President Wilson sighed that he could do nothing to help. But if China bowed its head and signed the treaty, it would immediately become Korea after the Russo-Japanese War in 1894 (a country handled by Japan), which was extremely dangerous. Finally, with a thunderous sound, the Chinese representatives did not sign the treaty and did not attend! Creating a new era of "revolutionary diplomacy" made the world powers look at it with new eyes. Afterwards, there was the Washington Conference, which limited Japan to return Qingdao; and the Nine-Power Treaty, which broke Japan's dream of monopolizing the East, and China's international status changed as a result. Mr. Lu is undoubtedly a historical great man. Some people say that the efforts of many parties at home and abroad cannot be attributed to one person. This is of course true, but we must think about what position Lu was in? He was the leader of the country's representatives, the first person responsible for special diplomatic events, not a puppet, let alone "making things happen because of others". Even if it was not his proposal, but he was able to observe public sentiment and follow group opinions, his knowledge and measure were deep and far-reaching, and his will was firm, he deserved his reputation. Therefore, he is called the leader of "loyalty".

Why is he called the leader of "treachery"? In 1915 (the fourth year of the Republic of China), Japan proposed the Twenty-One Demands, which were aimed at further monopolizing all Chinese interests and handling East Asia, after occupying Qingdao and various road and mineral rights in Shandong. Lu, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, negotiated with the Japanese envoy Hioki Eki dozens of times, and finally agreed to sign the treaty because the other party put forward the ultimatum. The whole country was indignant and designated May 9 as the unprecedented "National Humiliation Day", comparing the Twenty-One Demands to a bill of sale. As evidenced by the various incidents launched by the Japanese afterwards, Dr. Gu Weijun's speech at the Paris Peace Conference that the Twenty-One Demands were Japan's intention to treat China as a second Korea was indeed the truth. Then, Lu, who personally signed this treaty, was of course undeniable in his role. Perhaps some people will say that at that time, there was Yuan Shikai at the top and Cao Ruilin and others at the bottom, hinting at what to hint, and running around. These are of course also facts, however, leading to the above sentence, the proper person in charge in diplomatic authority must not be regarded as a puppet, or a monarch without real power.

### Interesting Headline Gleanings

— Sun Hong

Examining the *Shen Bao* newspapers from the Guangxu years thirty-six and thirty-seven, carefully looking at their news titles, they are quite interesting. Most news titles were fixed, with each place name compiled into a "poetic phrase" as a general title. For example, "Jin Tai Xiao Zhi" (Minor Records of the Golden Terrace) was the Beijing correspondence, "Yu Xue Tan Qi" (Exploring Wonders of Yu's Cave) was the Shaoxing correspondence, "Jiu Shui Wen Lin" (Literary Unicorn of Jiu River) was the Wuhu correspondence, "Jiang Huai Fang Quan" (Jiang Huai Delegation of Power) was Anqing, "Qin Huai Lu Chang" (Oar Songs of the Qin River) was Nanjing, "Lu Cheng Ke Shu" (Visitor's Account from Deer City) was the Wenzhou correspondence, and so on. It seems that at that time, newspaper readers and newspaper editors alike had experience with examination poetry, so the titles could be refined in this way. The most interesting one was when a Yangzhou correspondence suddenly bore a new title, "Riding a Crane for a Leisurely Tour," which was like presenting someone with a funeral banner.
