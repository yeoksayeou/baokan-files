### The New Min Battle Reaches its Climax; National Army Recaptures Laobian and Santaizi in Western Shenyang; Zheng Dongguo and Luo Zekai Arrive in Beiping from Guling

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 25th] The battle in Xinmin reached its climax on the 24th, becoming particularly fierce at night. The defending forces concentrated all their efforts to fight back, holding on to key strongholds. As of the 25th, the sound of artillery fire and aerial bombardment from both sides filled the air, resulting in a chaotic battle. Foreign news reports stating that the defending forces in Xinmin had retreated are premature, but the situation is indeed critical. The battle in the Juliu River area is extremely fierce. It is reported that the main force of the defending army has retreated, with the rearguard troops still fighting hard. The air force is heavily bombing the area between Juliu River and Xinmin to prevent the advance of the communist bandits. Furthermore, there have been continuous battles north of Xinglongdian since the 24th, where the communist bandits are attempting to contain the defending forces and hinder the National Army from reinforcing Xinmin.

Moreover, in the north at Kaiyuan and in the south at Yingkou, the bandits only attempted probing attacks, without any major actions.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 25th] The fighting in Xinmin has subsided slightly, with both sides currently redeploying.

It is rumored that Luo has been dispatched to the Northeast as a supervisor of the war effort. After disembarking, Zheng and Luo went to the Ministry of National Defense guesthouse in Taiping Hutong for a short rest, and then visited Li Zongren. Li Zongren, Fu Zuoyi, Zheng Dongguo, Fan Hanjie and others held an important meeting that evening. In addition to Zheng relaying instructions from the highest authorities, the participating leaders also discussed in detail issues such as North China's support for the Northeast and opening up the Beining Railway. After completing this mission, Zheng and Luo will fly to Shenyang. After a brief stop in Shenyang, Zheng will go to the Qinhuangdao, Yuguan, and Jinzhou areas to deploy military forces. Zheng has already discussed handover matters for the First Army Corps with Fan Hanjie in Beiping today. It is understood that the responsibilities of Zheng and Fan have been divided: Zheng is responsible for field operations along the Beining Line, while Fan is responsible for suppressing small groups of scattered bandits in the border areas of Hebei, Jehol and Liaoning.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 25th] Since arriving in Beiping, Xiong Shihui has been in frequent contact with military and political leaders in North China.

### The Chairman Postpones His Return to Nanjing; No Important Military Conference Held in Guling

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] At today's press conference of the Executive Yuan's News Bureau, someone asked Director Dong: (1) What activities is Chairman Chiang engaged in while in Guling? Who has he met with? (2) It is rumored that Chairman Chiang has convened multiple military conferences with senior officials in Guling. Is this news accurate? If so, who attended the meetings? What was the nature of the meetings? Director Dong replied: Although Guling is a summer capital, the winter scenery after the snow is also particularly beautiful. The various activities of the Chairman since arriving in Guling have been regularly reported by various newspapers. Due to the completeness of modern transportation, the Chairman can handle national affairs in Guling as conveniently as in Nanjing. Several government officials, such as Wang Lingji, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and Guo Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Services, have visited Guling to pay their respects to the Chairman and make reports. To the best of my knowledge, the Chairman has not convened any important military conferences in Guling.

### The Situation is Renewed, and the Morale of the Military is Stabilized; The Situation in the Northeast Can Be Reversed; A Certain Dignitary in Beiping Discusses the Current Situation in the Northeast

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 25th] A certain dignitary involved in the highest political circles received reporters in Beiping today with a relaxed mood. He observed the current situation in the Northeast from the perspective of an "experienced person" and used playing mahjong as an analogy, saying: "The military setbacks in the Northeast over the past six months are not due to the strength of the communist bandits or the weakness of the National Army, but because we played several wrong cards in a row, which allowed the next player to 'win'." He said, "Now the situation in the Northeast is renewed, and the morale of the military is stabilized. If we can boost morale again and not be greedy for big hands, but continuously make some small 'wins,' we can slowly turn the situation around." He believes that military morale is more important than the number of troops. Currently, the number of troops in the Northeast is not too small, and the New First Army and the New Sixth Army are particularly strong and available. He is unwilling to lightly estimate the role that the re-employment of veteran generals in the Northeast can play at present. He emphasized the importance of opening up the Beining Railway, while Yingkou has little value in terms of supplies because it can only dock ships of two or three thousand tons.

### The Saying that Intellectuals and the Government Are Estranged is Incorrect; Dong XianGuang's Clarification of Ambassador Stuart's Remarks

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] At the press conference held by the Executive Yuan News Bureau at 3:30 PM on the 25th, someone asked Director Dong: "Ambassador Stuart once said that if Chinese intellectuals could establish progressive groups to stimulate government decision-making, peace could be enhanced. What are your comments on this? Is it true that there is a deep gap between the Chinese government and intellectuals?" Director Dong replied: "Ambassador Stuart is deeply aware of the situation in our country's education circles, and I am impressed. However, Ambassador Stuart's statement that Chinese intellectuals cannot cooperate with the government seems to be an overstatement. Our country, like other countries, may have some intellectuals who, emotionally, cannot sympathize with the government's measures. Most of them may take a critical attitude towards any government. Is this not a manifestation of what 　Bernard Shaw called the 'Professional Against' temperament? The government is very pleased that there are such outspoken people in our intellectual circles, because this is a manifestation of the sound development of thought, which can provide the government with a yardstick for measuring political achievements at any time. However, it would be an exaggeration to infer from this that the majority of Chinese intellectuals oppose the government. There is still no such sign to be found. If it is said that China has turned to the left because Chinese university students take the same attitude as university students in other countries, pointing out problems and being dissatisfied with the status quo, the argument is far-fetched and lacks evidence. It is similar to saying that the United States has completely turned to Marxism because there is a Harvard Socialist Association at Harvard University. In fact, the majority of Chinese intellectuals are sincerely cooperating with the government. The reason why their words and deeds are rarely reported in newspapers is that they are unwilling to waste time engaging in self-promotion. However, this does not diminish their value as pillars of our government. I would like to assure you that intellectuals will continue to cooperate with the government, because they know that only under the rule of the National Government can they obtain survival and freedom, and then seek political and economic reform. If the National Government unfortunately fails, China will lose its independence, and the hope of consolidating a democratic polity will be impossible to realize."

### Li TieZheng Arrives in Nanjing

Immediately Pays Respects to Foreign Minister Wang and Others to Report on the Political Situation in Siam and the Situation of Overseas Chinese

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] Li TieZheng, our ambassador to Siam, left Bangkok to return to the country to report on his duties. He flew back to the capital via Hong Kong at 1:30 PM on the 25th, and immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the political situation in Siam, the situation of the people, and the recent situation of overseas Chinese in great detail with Foreign Minister Wang, Vice Ministers Liu and Ye, and Director of the East Asian Department Huang Zhengming, and others. According to what Li told our reporter: The purpose of his trip is to report the reasons, process, and consequences of the political changes in Siam to the government for reference. He said: The lives and property of overseas Chinese suffered little loss during the political changes in Siam. In the past three months, the new government has been quite慎重 in handling foreign relations. Regarding the education of overseas Chinese, we insist that the bilateral treaty benefit, and overseas Chinese have the freedom to educate their children. Regarding the dispute over the flag hanging in overseas Chinese schools, our overseas Chinese side has stated that our national flag and the Siamese flag can be raised and lowered at the same time, but Siamese newspapers have distorted the report a lot, so the dispute is still ongoing. This action is obviously unfriendly. However, the amount of Siamese rice transported to China is more than in any previous period. Li discussed the political situation in Siam and said: The small number of voters in the election is a fact, but the principals are quite fair. Currently, Khuang Aphaiwong is ordered to form a cabinet, but the Phibun faction still has the strength, and there is no harmony between the two factions. It is still 朱可 역料 whether the new cabinet can successfully emerge on the 26th. Our country's attitude towards Siam must be decided after its new government appears. Whether he will return to his post and when he will return to his post will also depend on the order and then decide his actions. As for the diplomatic situation in Bangkok, no country has taken unilateral action. The United Kingdom has the most investment and interests in Siam. The initial impact of the political changes was quite severe, but after adjustments, the situation has generally improved. Now the UK's policy towards Xun can be the same step as the Sino-US.

### Xu Baiyuan Speaks:

The Policy on Industrial and Agricultural Loans Has Not Yet Been Decided

[United Hui Xin News Agency Dispatch] Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Four Joint Offices, said that although the Board of Directors of the Four Joint Offices has held meetings to carefully review how to handle industrial and mining production and agricultural loans in the future, they have not yet reached a decision stage. As for the basic principles, industrial and mining loans will be changed to purchase-on-order and entrust-production methods to increase production and help the government grasp materials, and interest will be calculated with reference to the market to avoid the ills of speculation and hoarding. The specific methods and various technical issues are being discussed by the responsible personnel. Agricultural loans are an important task this year. The loan methods, amounts, and types reported by various newspapers are premature, because the opinions put forward by the Farmers Bank of China and the Central Cooperative Treasury are only part of the preliminary plan. This office has also solicited the opinions of the responsible ministries of finance, economy, food, agriculture and forestry, and water conservancy, and is continuing to study and discuss them. No specific decision has been made yet. The formulation of the agricultural loan plan, and whether it can be approved after formulation, are all unknown.

It is also learned that the Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement, which is currently partially effective, will not be effective without a Sino-Macao agreement of the same nature, because Macao and Hong Kong are both smuggling centers.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 25th] According to Hong Kong, Roger, the consultant of the Central Bank, recently arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai, and will go to Macao on the 26th with Yu Yingjie, the representative stationed in Hong Kong, to discuss the Sino-Macao anti-smuggling agreement with the Governor of Macao to completely eliminate smuggling in South China.

### The Democratic League Elements in Hong Kong Publicly Declare Rebellion

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 25th] According to reports, since the "Democratic League" announced its automatic dissolution on November 5 last year, branches in various parts of the country have ceased activities. Most of the members of the League have seen through the conspiracy of the communist bandits and have broken away from the relationship. The chairman of the League, Zhang Lan, and the responsible personnel of its headquarters, such as Shi Longji, Huang Yanpei, and Liang Shuming, are still living in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, while Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, and others have secretly gone to Hong Kong and merged with the original Southern General Branch, denying the dissolution order of the headquarters and secretly plotting to reorganize the organization, maintaining regular contact with the communist bandits in Hong Kong. It was finally decided to restore the headquarters, intensify illegal activities, and convene the Third Plenary Session last month. Due to internal disagreements and prolonged disputes, the meeting lasted for two weeks and did not end until the 19th of last month. In particular, the liquidation of Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, and others aroused fierce debate, but in the end it was completely controlled by the communist bandits. The content of its political report and original declaration was very激烈, and its recent activities in all aspects have further confirmed that its rebellious actions are completely in line with what it has declared.

### Badger Takes Office

General Kirk Returns to the United States Today, Gui Yongqing Arrives in Nanjing from Qingdao

[United News Agency, Qingdao, 25th] The newly appointed Commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, Badger, officially took office on the stern deck of the flagship USS Estes today. The ceremony was simple. U.S. Navy officers and soldiers and senior Chinese military officers were all present to observe the ceremony, and the seal was handed over by the former commander, Kirk. Kirk's four-star flag was immediately removed from the flagpole and replaced with Badger's three-star flag, and the handover ceremony ended. Kirk shook hands with Badger and others one by one and left the ship, and is scheduled to return to the country tomorrow on the transport ship Baffiel. The territory of the Western Pacific Fleet includes the Pacific region west of the Mariana Islands. With this command located less than 300 air miles from Lushun, occupied by the Soviet Union, important figures in China and the United States believe that it is essential for the United States to maintain a naval presence in Qingdao if the Soviet army concentrates in these two ports. A fleet patrolling the 300-mile sea between the Chinese mainland and Korea can effectively intercept any naval vessels north of the Yellow Sea. Badger served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the war, and was intelligent and brave. He led troops in attacking Okinawa and the Japanese mainland.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] Gui Yongqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, returned to Nanjing at 11:00 AM on the 25th after inspecting naval affairs in Qingdao. General David Barr, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, arrived with him.

### The Legislative Yuan's Five Committees Continue Reviewing: Budget Figures Unchanged; Reconsider Public Offering and Subsidy Policies

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance, Economics, Legal System, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs Committees held a joint session on the morning of the 25th to continue reviewing the general budget proposal. They amended and approved the "Report Outline on the Review of the Draft General Budget of Central Government Revenue and Expenditure for the First Half of the 37th Year," making no changes to the various figures listed in the budget proposal. They only offered opinions, which will be discussed and passed at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th before being sent to the Executive Yuan. The outline first points out that the budget expenditure is enormous, and with rising prices, the deficit will inevitably increase further, which cannot be fully covered by issuance and foreign debt alone. Secondly, it frankly points out that the budget is a matter of "perfunctory compliance" for national use and "lacks a fundamental reform plan." Its recommendations are divided into three parts, with the following key points:

(1) Revenue section: 1. The surplus or sale revenue of various state-run banks and other banks with official shares managed by the Ministry of Finance, as well as agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry agencies managed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the remaining U.S. military and Lend-Lease materials, enemy and puppet-received materials, and Japanese reparations materials, should all be realistically increased. 2. The tax collection agencies managed by the Ministry of Finance and the agencies handling the remaining U.S. military and Lend-Lease materials, enemy and puppet-received materials, and Japanese reparations materials should all be thoroughly reorganized to eliminate malpractices and enrich the treasury. 3. The government should earnestly find ways to make those with money contribute, in accordance with the principle of taxation based on ability to pay.

(2) Expenditure section: 1. Agencies established through legislative procedures and redundant agencies should be reviewed and abolished to save costs. 2. The commercial and tax agencies under the Ministry of Finance and the organization of the Ministry of National Defense should be simplified to reduce waste. 3. Education funds should be listed in full according to the Constitution, accounting for 15% of the total budget.

(3) Other sections: 1. State-owned enterprises should hire experts to thoroughly verify their assets and profits and losses to facilitate reorganization and enrich the treasury, and they should each prepare operating budgets for review by the Legislative Yuan. 2. Public offering [of currency or bonds] should dispel public doubts and anxieties to stabilize currency value and curb prices. 3. After the cancellation of subsidy policies, state-owned enterprises are leading the rise in prices. The multiple of price increases in the past year has been even more severe than in the past. The subsidy policy needs to be reconsidered.

### Soviet Government Formally Announces: Roshchin Appointed as Ambassador to China; Petrov Relieved of Duty Due to Illness

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 25th] The Soviet government announced today that Ambassador to China Petrov has been relieved of his duties due to illness and will be succeeded by Major General Roshchin. The Soviet government expressed its intention to transfer the ambassador to our government on the 13th of this month and sought our consent. Our government expressed its acceptance five days later. The new ambassador was originally the military attaché at the Soviet Embassy in Nanjing and has been in China for a long time.

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] An official spokesperson today indirectly confirmed the news that the Soviet Union has sought China's consent to appoint military expert Semyon Roshchin as Ambassador to China. When asked if the report that Moscow recommended Roshchin to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was true, the spokesperson replied that it was difficult to comment. Observers here believe that the official spokesperson's failure to deny this is tantamount to indirect confirmation. Roshchin has been in China for over eight years, and during the war, he served as the military attaché at the Soviet Embassy, stationed in Chongqing. According to those around him, Roshchin "took leave to return home" several weeks ago, while current Ambassador Petrov is in the Soviet Union for "consultations."

### Important Meeting at Zhang Qun's Residence: Discussions Allegedly Related to U.S. Aid; Zhang Jia'ao Revisits the Envoy After the Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] According to reliable sources, an important meeting was held at Premier Zhang Qun's residence on the morning of the 25th. Besides Zhang himself, only Zhang Jia'ao and Wang Shijie participated. This meeting was convened by Zhang Qun while he was slightly indisposed. Zhang Jia'ao arrived around 9:00 AM, while Wang Shijie first attended the Central Political Committee meeting to report on foreign affairs. He left before the meeting ended and arrived at Zhang's residence around 10:00 AM. The three met for over two hours, dispersing at 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, Zhang Jia'ao revisited Ambassador Stuart, remaining in conversation for fifty minutes. The content of the two conversations held this morning and afternoon was not revealed, but it is widely believed to be related to the U.S. aid issue. The fact that Zhang Qun, while slightly indisposed, still convened Zhang and Wang for a two-hour meeting further highlights its importance.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Foreign Minister Wang reported on foreign affairs at the KMT Central Political Committee meeting on the 25th, covering (1) the progress and results of U.S. aid, (2) the determination of Japan's industrial level, and (3) our attitude towards the North Korean issue.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] According to the Ministry of Food, from January to June of this year, China can obtain an international aid rice quota of 200,045 tons. From July of last year to June of this year, an estimated wheat quota of 300,000 tons can be obtained. This quota will be allocated monthly by the supplying countries, and the grain-purchasing countries will gradually purchase it. In the above-mentioned rice and wheat quotas for our country, a portion will be allocated to the U.S. government, which will use relief funds to purchase and transport it to China, matching an equivalent amount of grain from our government for distribution in five cities. The government's own purchases are mostly allocated as soon as they arrive, so there is no risk of spoilage.

### U.S. Aid and Self-Help

— Cheng Tianfang

The long-awaited U.S. aid to China bill was finally submitted to the U.S. Congress by President Truman in a special message on the 18th of this month. The message stated that the United States has continuously supported the National Government for twenty years since its establishment. The United States has provided China with a large amount of assistance during the war against Japan and after Japan's surrender. The reason is that "the people of China and the United States have many years of sincere friendship, long-standing commercial and cultural ties, and close cooperation. The people of the United States have always admired the people of China and sympathize with the various tests and difficulties they have encountered. The United States has long recognized that China's stability is extremely important to lasting peace in the Pacific and the world. China has become an important factor in international relations due to its large land and population. China has excellent traditions and culture, and a large and energetic population. We sincerely hope that China will be strong and advanced so that it can make full contributions to the strengthening of international forces." The specific measures proposed are to request Congress to approve US$570 million as aid to China before June 30, 1949. This amount can be a loan or a gift. Of this amount, US$510 million will be used to purchase the goods most needed by China, such as wheat, rice, cotton, petroleum and petroleum products, fertilizers, tobacco, drugs, non-ferrous metals, and steel products, as well as machine parts. US$60 million will be used to fund large-scale industries, such as the Shanghai Power Company, the Yuehan Railway, the Ganxi and Hunan Xiangtan coal mines, and may include sugar mills, fertilizer plants, cement plants, and wharf equipment in Taiwan. In summary, this U.S. aid is in the form of materials rather than cash, and it will be delivered in installments rather than in a lump sum. Its purpose is to "give the Chinese government time to breathe in the economic recession so that it can find ways to establish a more stable economic situation." Therefore, the condition of U.S. aid is that the Chinese government must guarantee to the United States that "it will take practical economic, financial, and other measures to achieve the goal of economic stability and recovery." If the United States believes that the Chinese government has not fulfilled this guarantee, it can stop this assistance at any time.

Two days after President Truman's message was submitted, Secretary of State Marshall testified when the House Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the aid to China plan. He first read a prepared speech, and then answered questions from the members of the committee, and presented documents on the economic aid to China plan. From these speeches, questions and answers, and documents, we can better understand the U.S. government's current China policy. Although General Marshall admitted that China is currently in serious difficulties and needs assistance, and the United States will provide assistance, he emphasized that "the Chinese problem must be solved by the Chinese people themselves... The aid to China plan should not include actual guarantees of China's economic future, and the United States should not take actions that would directly make it responsible for the actions of the Chinese government and its political, economic, and military aspects." In his speech and answers, General Marshall strictly criticized China's political and military situation, believing that the Chinese government had not accepted his constant suggestions during his year in China to improve political and military matters, resulting in the current serious situation. He also believes that aid to China is different from aid to Europe, because "European countries have a sound foundation for advice, but the situation in China is chaotic and no one can predict the future." Therefore, if Congress cannot solve these two matters at the same time, it should devote all its energy to first pass the aid to Europe bill, and then discuss aid to China. He further hinted that the United States is not prepared to assist China in reforming its currency system, because this requires a lot of funds, and most of these funds will be wasted at a time when China's civil war is underway. He pointed out that the communist army has caused terrible destruction to achieve the party's publicly announced goal of promoting the collapse of China's economy. On the one hand, he admitted that the provinces north of the Yangtze River may fall into the hands of the communists, but strangely, he also said that there is no evidence that the Chinese communist army has received foreign aid.

After the aid to China bill was submitted, people from all walks of life in the United States have been discussing this issue fiercely for the past week. The opinions from all parties can be roughly divided into four factions: One faction is the American Communist Party and its fellow travelers, such as the Far Eastern Democratic Policy Committee, and those who, although not such figures, unknowingly serve as tools of the Communist Party, such as Mr. Wallace and the Progressive Citizens of America he leads. They believe that the Chinese Communist Party is a democratic and progressive party, while the National Government is stubborn and reactionary, and a dictatorial government. They are willing to see the collapse of the National Government and the success of the Chinese Communist Party. Their mentality is that it is best for the United States to make a 180-degree turn, aid the CCP, and overthrow the government. If this cannot be done, at least the United States should adopt a Hands-off Policy and let China sort itself out. Therefore, they adopt a resolutely opposed attitude towards any aid to China plan. However, this part of the population is really insignificant in the total population of the United States, and their views will not have much impact. Another faction includes Republican members of Congress, such as Senators Vandenberg, Taft, Speaker of the House Martin, Representatives Eaton, Judd, Smith, and many other gentlemen, as well as the newspapers of the Scripps Howard system. They support the aid to China bill, but express dissatisfaction: because the amount of aid is too small, and it is limited to economic aid, without including military and financial assistance, and it is delayed until next June to pay it off, I am afraid there is a danger of it being too late. The third faction can be represented by powerful newspapers such as the New York Times and the Herald Tribune. They support this bill, but adopt a prudent tone, believing that whether aid to China will be effective depends on China's own efforts. The fourth faction is another group of powerful newspapers, such as the Washington Post, the Baltimore Sun, and the Christian Science Monitor. They are anti-communist, but they do not support aiding China at this time; because they are too disappointed in China, believing that before China's political and economic systems are greatly reformed, aiding China is like throwing money into a bottomless pit.

What are our feelings when we look at this U.S. aid from the perspective of Chinese people? In terms of the spirit of the aid to China bill, we are sincerely grateful for the goodwill of our allies in helping China overcome economic difficulties, especially President Truman's message, which is filled with sympathy and friendship for the Chinese people. This kind of sympathy and friendship is worthy of our cherishing. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the CCP, the American Communist Party, and their fellow travelers have continuously engaged in instigating discord between China and the United States. As long as the relationship between the people of China and the United States becomes more and more estranged, and the friendship becomes weaker and weaker, the international communist ambitions in East Asia will be easier to realize. After reading President Truman's message, we know that the Communist Party's conspiracy has not succeeded in this regard, which makes us feel deeply gratified. However, in terms of the content of the aid to China bill, we feel that we cannot be completely satisfied. I believe that U.S. aid to China to eliminate the communist disaster and make China a stabilizing force for peace in the Far East requires both spiritual encouragement and substantial support. Substantial support can be divided into military, financial, and economic categories. These three types of assistance complement each other and are indispensable. Now, only economic aid is included in the aid to China bill, and military and financial assistance are both absent, which is a major flaw. As Mr. Judd said, a tripod needs three legs to support it. Now, only one leg has been installed, how can it stand firmly? Of course, the influx of US$570 million in materials into China will naturally have a considerable benefit to China's national economy, but this is only a kind of Relief, not a Cure, and it cannot cure China's serious disease. Because if the military situation cannot improve and the runaway inflation cannot be curbed by reforming the currency system, then the serious economic crisis, even if it is temporarily alleviated, will still occur soon. Some people hope to use this U.S. aid properly to stop inflation and stabilize prices. We only need to look at the fact that prices have soared in the week since the aid to China bill came out to know that this view seems too optimistic.

What is especially surprising is that General Marshall, a military strategist and politician, who now bears a major responsibility in world politics, still seems to have an incomplete understanding of the situation in China. He said that the Chinese problem must be solved by the Chinese people themselves, and also said that there is no evidence that the CCP has received foreign aid. Judging from these words, it is easy to believe that General Marshall's view is that the CCP is only an internal problem of China, not part of a world problem. If General Marshall holds this view, it is really a pity! Indeed, the CCP is so rampant because of the poor Chinese politics, which has done a lot of work to drive the birds to the forest. However, the CCP itself is undoubtedly a link in world communism, and the problems it causes are part of the world problem, and are by no means a simple domestic problem of China. How to solve the CCP problem will quickly affect the peace of the entire world. This is not only the same in nature as the Greek problem, but also has a much greater impact than the Greek problem. As for saying that the CCP has not received foreign aid, that is even more of a self-deceiving joke! We only need to ask: Why can Li Lisan run back to the Northeast from Moscow to be the leader of the Northeast Communist Party? Why was the communist army allowed to enter the Northeast in a steady stream during the period of Soviet military occupation? Why did the Japanese Kwantung Army's armaments fall into the hands of the communist army? Why are there Korean communists with well-equipped weapons participating in the war in the Northeast communist army today? After thinking about these questions, anyone will find the answer themselves.

There are still some people in the United States who believe that communism is a problem of thought and life. We must deal with it in terms of thought and life, and we cannot eliminate communism by force. Therefore, they oppose the Chinese government's use of force against the Communist Party, and they also oppose the use of military force to aid China. These people are really a bit bookish, knowing one but not the other. We admit that all ideologies and all thoughts cannot be eliminated by force. The inability of force to eliminate communism is just like the inability of force to eliminate fascism and Nazism. We want to eliminate these totalitarian ideas that are different on the surface but the same in substance. We can only use educational methods to cultivate sound human thoughts, and at the same time use economic transformation methods to enable humans to obtain happiness in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. All deviant ideas will naturally not be blindly followed. However, dealing with the Chinese Communist Party, which has hundreds of thousands of troops and is rebelling, is different from dealing with simple communism. We cannot eliminate ideology by force, but at the same time, we must never eliminate the rebellious force that has already formed by thought and life alone. China today cannot but use force to eliminate the Communist Party, just as President Lincoln could not but use force during the American Civil War, and as the Allied countries could not but use force to defeat Germany and Japan during World War II. If President Lincoln did not use force, the United States would not have become a unified democratic republic. If the Allied countries could not defeat Germany and Japan, the entire world would be conquered by Germany and Japan: If China does not eliminate the Communist Party, the entire China will be controlled by the Communist Party!

Although Americans have many wrong views about China, which has affected their less active China policy, we should still try our best to reflect on ourselves and not just blame others. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we have really done many things that grieve our loved ones and please our enemies! Our political, military, financial, and economic weaknesses are really too many, so the Communist Party has an opportunity to take advantage of and develop as much as possible. What is past is past. We must start today to do the work of mending the fold after the sheep are lost in order to salvage this serious situation. We hope for assistance from others, so we must fully help ourselves. Therefore, all the shortcomings pointed out by General Marshall and others, whether they are completely correct or not, can be used as our stepping stones. In times of crisis, we must overcome all difficulties and implement thorough reforms in political, military, financial, and economic aspects. This will not only strengthen international goodwill, but also win back the hearts of the people at home. If the government can go in this direction regardless of all obstacles, I think that although the amount of U.S. aid is not enough, it can still be fully utilized and achieve considerable results. Moreover, after this material assistance, other forms of assistance may come in a steady stream, and the situation in China will gradually have hope of becoming clear. If politics, military, finance, and economy cannot be coordinated with U.S. aid to improve, and the situation is as serious as it is now, or even more serious, after June next year, then this US$570 million will be equivalent to not having any effect, and will suit the Communist Party and its fellow travelers. Whether China's future is a blessing or a disaster, whether it is maintaining peace or creating chaos for the world, a part of it depends on whether our allies have a sufficient understanding of China and whether their actions are active, but most of it still depends on our own choices!

### Ministry of National Defense News Bureau Releases Analysis of Recent War Situation: It is Not Difficult for National Army in Northeast to Turn to a Favorable Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Ministry of National Defense News Bureau released the following full analysis of the recent war situation from February 18th to 24th on the 25th:

Northeast Region

The communist bandit activity in the Northeast is exploiting the severe cold weather to isolate Shenyang by cutting off transportation lines while Yingkou and Huludao are frozen. They rely on international support and the flexibility of rear transportation lines, fighting and retreating repeatedly, using the strategy of "the strong preying on the weak," and never engaging in head-on decisive battles. From the Jichang Campaign to the present, they have not deviated from this strategic principle. Following the Liaoyang battle, they immediately launched an attack on Anshan. Currently, from the 12th to the afternoon of the 20th, the defending forces, with only two regiments, fought repeatedly against about 100,000 communist bandits from the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 5th columns, exacting a price three times greater than their own losses. Although the communist bandits mobilized all the artillery in southern Liaoning, concentrating over thirty heavy artillery pieces and over fifty mountain guns for concentrated bombardment, they still did not shake the morale of the defending forces. The fighting continued until the last stronghold in the steel plant was occupied before the defending forces broke out and retreated eastward with the workers.

Regarding the surrounding situation, because the communist bandits are extending southward to Yingkou, detouring northward to Faku, and increasing defenses westward along the Daling River at Goubangzi and Dahushan, their forces are already stretched thin. Therefore, they are increasingly feeling the pressure from the National Army on the Beining Railway. If the ice thaws completely and maritime transport is unobstructed, the communist bandits will naturally feel even more threatened. Therefore, they are eager to isolate Shenyang in the short term. However, more than three months have passed since the communist bandits launched their offensive, and Shenyang remains as strong as ever. Except for the Liaonan area, the surrounding strongholds are still standing firmly. Faku was a strategic retreat by the National Army. The communist bandits have failed to achieve their military objective of attacking Shenyang from a junction in western Liaoning and can only use methods of cutting off transportation and preventing the entry of supplies to achieve a prolonged siege. As a result of this prolonged war, it is not difficult for the National Army to seize opportunities to turn the situation to their advantage.

Central China Region

The Dabie Mountain battle in Central China has entered the mopping-up stage. The main force of Chen Yi's communist bandit troops is being pursued northward by the National Army, fleeing toward western Shandong. They did not gain a foothold in Chengwu, Caoxian, or Shanxian and were immediately ambushed by the National Army from both sides. Their original plan was to destroy the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, but they were unable to achieve their goal due to the National Army's relentless pursuit. In addition to using the 4th and 6th columns and the Liangguang column as covering forces, the 3rd column and part of the 1st and 6th columns are stationed north and south of Minquan and Lanfeng to contain the pursuing troops. The 8th column and the 10th and 11th columns, a total of three columns, are fleeing southward, attempting to rebuild the supply line to support Liu's communist bandits. Part of them have reached the vicinity of Zhecheng, and part of them are still near Xiayi, avoiding battle and fleeing southward.

In summary, regarding the dynamics of the war situation inside and outside the passes, the Northeast is at a stalemate, and the National Army inside the passes is undertaking a combined military, political, and economic mopping-up campaign. The gain or loss of a city or town, or the repeated gains and losses of each location on the battlefield, is no longer the deciding factor in the war. This is what we must know when analyzing the war situation in all aspects.

### President Accepts Resignations of Right-Wing Cabinet Members, Czech Communist Party Forms New Cabinet, Social Democratic Party Splinter Group Participates in Cooperation

[Our Dispatch] London, 25th broadcast: Prague dispatch, Czech Republic: President Benes has formally accepted the cabinet list submitted by Premier Gottwald. Another dispatch, according to witnesses, police opened fire on marching students today.

[Associated Press, Prague, 25th] The government radio station announced this afternoon (approximately 7:30 PM Shanghai time) that President Benes has yielded to the demands of the Communist Party and approved the resignations of twelve anti-communist cabinet members. The new government will be formed this afternoon, largely under the control of the Communist Party.

[United Press, Prague, 25th] Communist Premier Gottwald, accompanied by several communist ministers, met with President Benes at 6:00 PM this afternoon to present the list of new cabinet members. Leaders of the opposition parties have acknowledged defeat, but the Catholic Church, led by Bishop Beran, has appealed to the Czech people to "restore reason, not forget responsibility, and maintain the law." The Gottwald cabinet, which replaces the former Six-Party Coalition Cabinet, will be composed of some Communist Party members willing to cooperate with the Communist Party, as well as a small number of defectors from the opposition parties. Benes is scheduled to address the nation at 8:00 PM, at which time the final decision on the new cabinet may be made. Previously, the president's statements indicated that he could only accept a new cabinet based on constitutional parliamentary rules. The Communist Party's announcement stated that the new cabinet is based on a majority of the Constituent Assembly. However, the Communist coup seems to have split the Social Democratic Party. Only one faction, led by the left-wing Fierlinger, who served as the Czech ambassador to the Soviet Union and the first premier after the war, will participate in the new cabinet. The party leadership, including Chairman Lausman and Secretary-General Vilim, sent a letter to Benes, declaring their support and stating that the president's attitude in the political crisis should be respected. The letter stated that the party's executive committee unanimously believes that the divisions that caused the crisis are not insurmountable but must be resolved based on the principles of the National Front (meaning the multi-party cabinet) in accordance with the charter. Benes' speech tonight will be his first public address to the nation in the four days since the coup.

[Reuters, Prague, 25th] Communist police today began arresting people involved in the so-called British and American spy conspiracy. The Prague radio station, under Communist Party control, said that those arrested were people who maintained regular contact with consuls of the two Western countries. At the same time, the Communist police and the action committees of the trade unions are rapidly strengthening their lightning-acquired powers throughout the country. Worker demonstrations are heading towards the Presidential Palace.

[Associated Press, Prague, 25th] The Communist Party has de facto control of Czechoslovakia. The last bastion of non-Communist forces throughout troubled Czechoslovakia is President Benes alone. Constitutionally, Benes is the head of state and must avoid aligning himself with any party and is limited in his power to directly interfere with the government. Throughout the Communist "bloodless coup," Benes acted like the Supreme Court, demanding a fair resolution of the political upheaval. Since last Friday, the 63-year-old Benes has worked 18 hours a day seeking a democratic solution. His term is seven years, expiring in 1953. Although he is old, he is determined to complete his term.

### United States Pays Close Attention to Developments in the Czech Republic, Future Actions of the Soviet Union Are Extremely Noteworthy

[Our Dispatch] New York, 25th broadcast: Washington dispatch, diplomatic circles predict that after the Communist Party controls Czechoslovakia, France and Italy will soon experience new difficulties incited by the Soviet Union behind the scenes. It is widely believed that Moscow will soon increase pressure on Greece, Turkey, Finland, and Iran.

[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] US officials do not express surprise at the coup in Czechoslovakia. Since the Soviet Union sent a strongly worded letter to Czechoslovakia last summer, ordering it to change its decision to participate in the Marshall Plan, the State Department has expected that the Soviet Union would eventually seize everything in Czechoslovakia, as it has done with other Eastern European countries.

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The United States reluctantly acknowledged on the 24th that the complete fall of Czechoslovakia into the hands of the Communist Party was a fait accompli. Of the Eastern European countries, only Czechoslovakia was still able to open a small window to the West and prevent the Kremlin from controlling its internal affairs. The United States is unable to provide assistance today and cannot even issue a protest. However, it is expected that the State Department will soon find a way to openly declare that the United States fully understands the illegal means by which the Czech Communists have placed the entire country under the Soviet yoke.

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Well-informed international economic experts here say that if the Communist Party seizes power in Czechoslovakia, the country may lose the $350 million in loans from the World Bank. Czech foreign trade will become abnormal, and the domestic living standards will decline.

### Czech President,崇仰Democracy, Letter to Communist Party Released

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 25th] Czech President Benes recently sent a letter to the Communist Party leader, stating, "You know that I have a sincere belief in democracy, and I cannot abandon it at this time, because I believe that democracy is the only sound and permanent foundation for achieving a noble and honest human life. I believe that democracy cannot exist without parliamentary freedom and a parliamentary government. I fully understand the necessity of social and economic reforms within the scope of democracy. My past political life has been guided by this principle, and if I violate this principle, I will be unfaithful to my own beliefs and to the trust placed in me. Our current national crisis can only be overcome by democratic and parliamentary means. This is not to say that I intend to disregard the demands of the Communist Party. I believe that all political parties should share political responsibility."

### The Czechs Seal the Border with Germany with Armed Security Police Gathering

[United Press International, Frankfurt, 25th] The U.S. occupation forces headquarters announced today that Czech security police, carrying firearms and pistols, have completely controlled their western border and sealed it off tightly. Under normal circumstances, only 30 police officers are stationed in Asch, but there are now at least 300, and border railway workers are also armed.

### Soviet Secret Agents Infiltrate Hawaii

Plot to Launch a Second Pearl Harbor Incident

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 25th Broadcast: Quincy, Massachusetts—Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Coolidge stated that Soviet secret agents are continuously infiltrating Hawaii to plot a new attack on Pearl Harbor, the ferocity of which will be comparable to the sneak attack made by the Japanese in 1941. Hawaii Governor Stainback has obtained various pieces of evidence, including instructions issued by the Communist Party to secret agents.

### US to Construct Cemetery in Memory of Pearl Harbor Attack

[United Press International, Washington, 25th] The U.S. House Appropriations Committee today approved over one million dollars for the construction of a memorial cemetery near Pearl Harbor, the site of the greatest military defeat in U.S. history, to commemorate the event. The cemetery will be constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers on "Sacrifice Ridge" in Hawaii, which overlooks Pearl Harbor.

### Security Council Continues Debate on Holy Land Partition Plan

Possible Amendments to the UN Plan

[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] The Security Council is scheduled to resume its debate on the Palestine issue at 8 p.m. standard time today. Even experts on the Palestine issue cannot predict the outcome of the debate. The U.S. yesterday avoided taking a firm stance on the Palestine issue in the Security Council, implicitly suggesting to other member states that the U.S. is not willing to provide troops at this stage to implement the partition plan. If this interpretation is accurate, the representatives of China and Argentina, who will speak today, will again criticize the partition plan. The resolution temporarily proposed by Colombia during yesterday's debate effectively takes into account amendments to the UN partition plan.

### Benelux Nations Join London Conference to Consult on Policy Toward West Germany France Firmly Opposes German Centralization

[Reuters, London, 24th] A spokesperson for the French Embassy stated: Discussions between the U.K., U.S., and France on the German issue are continuing in London, and no resolutions have been established. He declined to disclose further information, and no communiqué was issued after the meeting. Delegations from the Benelux countries are expected to attend the meeting on the 25th to participate in the discussion of the first item on the agenda.

[Reuters, Paris, 25th] It is believed here that the French delegation participating in the London Tripartite Conference will present a new defense of the method of controlling Germany that every French government since the end of the war has insisted on. However, whether this will lead to a convergence of opinions among the three powers remains to be seen. France's insistence is based on its own security, so France demands effective control of the Ruhr area by the Allied countries, and therefore firmly opposes a centralized central government in Germany or West Germany. An advisor to Foreign Minister Bidault revealed that France's official position on German policy will be as follows: France believes that Europe cannot truly recover unless Western European countries can have genuine political and economic unity, and this unity must include the participation of West Germany. However, if West Germany is a highly centralized government, the European group will inevitably be manipulated by Germany.

### Nordic Nations Establish Economic Committee to Study Cooperation Methods

[Reuters, Oslo, 24th] The foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland issued a communiqué after concluding their meeting here, declaring that the four countries have decided to participate in the Marshall Plan and the working committee to promote economic cooperation among the sixteen European countries. The four governments also recognize that the success of the Marshall Plan is of decisive importance for the recovery of Europe. The four governments share the same views on the problems that the Marshall Plan intends to solve. The communiqué further announced that the four Nordic countries have decided to establish an economic cooperation committee immediately to consider: (1) unifying the tariffs of the four Nordic countries to establish a customs union; (2) reducing tariffs and trade quantity restrictions among the four Nordic countries; (3) expanding the distribution of industrial and commercial labor and the promotion of technology among the four countries, and promoting the emergence of new industries to achieve mutual economy among the four countries; (4) extending the existing four-country commercial cooperation system.

### Jiang Tingfu Declares at Small Assembly: We Sincerely Hope for Korean-Soviet Cooperation, Actions That Divide North and South Korea Should Be Avoided

[Reuters, Lake Success, 24th] Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu today appealed to the United Nations Korean Commission in the United Nations Small Assembly to avoid actions that would strengthen the division of North and South Korea. He also stated: The Chinese government sincerely hopes that Korea can develop friendly relations with the Soviet Union. U.S. representative Jessup expressed the U.S.'s support for holding elections in South Korea immediately to establish a national government. Jiang Tingfu said: The United Nations Korean Commission should avoid actions that would make the division between North and South Korea more concrete. We must be extra cautious when reviewing any actions. I believe that the path stipulated in the UN resolution is most conducive to promoting the independence and unification of Korea. The Chinese government will never allow the Korean national government to adopt an anti-Soviet policy. On the contrary, China sincerely hopes that Korea can develop the friendliest relations with the Soviet Union.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 24th] The debate on the Korean issue continued into the afternoon without any resolution, and the Small Assembly adjourned to reconvene on the morning of the 25th.

### Soviet Union and Burma Establish Diplomatic Relations

[United Press International, Rangoon, 25th] The Burmese government today announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and the two countries will soon establish embassies in Rangoon and Moscow.

### Wallace Criticizes Marshall Plan

Believes It Will Eventually Lead to War

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] After Wallace delivered his criticism of the Marshall European Recovery Program before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he stated in response to reporters' inquiries: The Marshall Plan will complete the division of Europe and eventually lead to war.

### French Prime Minister Schuman Regains Parliamentary Confidence

But May Trigger National Strike

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The National Assembly, with a vote of 291 to 268, passed a vote supporting the government's rejection of the four to five thousand franc banknotes it received, thus giving Prime Minister Schuman his sixth vote of confidence. Subsequently, the General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the Communist Party, announced that it would soon propose a general wage increase of 50% above the level before December. The General Confederation of Labor argued that the wage standard should be based on a minimum of 12,000 francs per month, not the current 10,000 francs. The declaration also stated that since the government is unwilling to fulfill its promises, workers will henceforth rely on their own organization and unity to achieve the satisfaction of their legitimate demands. It is generally believed that this declaration by the General Confederation of Labor is tantamount to declaring war on the government's financial reform plan (including the freezing of wages), and it is expected that another nationwide strike movement will occur in three or four weeks.

### Romanian Parliament Dissolved, General Election to be Held Next Month

[United Press International, Bucharest, 24th] The Romanian Parliament today voted to dissolve itself automatically, and it was decided that an election would be held on March 26 to form a new parliament to draft a new constitution.

The Prosecutor's Office also accused Kyoji Kimura of being the "Butcher of Burma."

### The New Ashida Cabinet in Japan May Be Formed Early Next Month

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Supreme Executive Council of the Japanese Democratic Party held a meeting yesterday, appointing Tomabechi, Inaba, and Kitamura as representatives of the Policy Coordination Council, and granting them full authority to reconcile with the Socialist Party. It was generally speculated at the meeting that the formation work could be completed before the 3rd of next month, and the Prime Minister's appointment ceremony and the certification ceremony for each cabinet member could be held on the 3rd.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The policy coordination meeting of the three Japanese political parties officially opened today, with Tomabechi, Inaba, and Kitamura attending on behalf of the Democratic Party, and Asanuma, Suzuki, and Mizutani attending on behalf of the Socialist Party. Okada, Funada, and Takeda attended on behalf of the People's Cooperative Party.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] It is also reported here that an agreement on a US$80 million cotton loan to Japan may be finalized recently.

Chit-Chatting on Wheat Planting and Raft Making in the Kremlin

On the evening of October 18, the foreign ministers of the three countries met in the Kremlin, showing every sign of sincere cooperation and being able to act effectively. We quickly agreed on several points, such as: not giving speeches, the selection of advisors participating in our meeting, the meeting location, and the first communiqué to be issued.

When I returned to the embassy, I saw a telegram from the State Department regarding a cable that Mr. Churchill sent to the President on October 12, in which he suggested that the heads of the three countries issue a joint communiqué on the punishment of Germans who committed atrocities. The telegram stated that the President hoped I would consider the wording of this statement so that it could be issued at the end of the Moscow Conference.

It was also suggested that, in addition to not affecting the actions we might take against past offenders, special warnings should be issued regarding present and future atrocities. This was to prevent forcing German criminals to extremes and killing innocent victims when there was no way out.

Before the first formal meeting scheduled for the afternoon of the 19th, Eden and Molotov both visited me individually at Spaso House (the American Embassy).

Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador who accompanied Eden (who later became the British Ambassador to Washington), raised the Soviet side's desire to discuss military issues, especially the issue of a second front. I stated that I would explain the United States' determination, which was to carry out the war to the end and provide full assistance to its allies. We agreed that we should give the Soviet Union full information about our plans, the reasons for our decisions, and the results obtained, and accept any suggestions it wished to make, but it should be made clear that military negotiations could not be conducted at the meeting.

The first question I raised to Molotov was about the Soviet censorship system. American reporters were not allowed to publish human interest stories about the arrival of the American delegation in Moscow. I asked him whether it was not allowed to publish news about the general situation of the meeting that did not involve official work. Molotov loudly said that the censor was "stupid" and said that he would pay attention to this.

Just before we went to the meeting (December 23), Molotov said that he had discussed with Stalin the declaration in the President's proposal regarding German atrocities. Stalin had indicated his agreement after making slight modifications.

When atrocities were discussed at the meeting, the Soviet side took a firm stance. They had suffered greatly at the hands of the Germans, and they hoped for severe and swift legal sanctions against the German officials responsible for the mass murder of Soviet citizens.

Eden argued that all legal formalities should be observed.

When it was my turn to speak, I said:

"If it were up to me, I would bring Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, and their main accomplices and take them to a temporary military court on the battlefield. At sunrise the next day, a historic event would take place."

When these words were translated, Molotov and his entire delegation cheered loudly, expressing their approval, and the peace of the meeting was temporarily broken.

The main point I had in mind regarding this issue when I was in Moscow was that the world should deal in a drastic way with the situation caused by powerful dictators and their plans to conquer and enslave the world, as well as their barbaric methods. I felt that this type of fugitive from justice should be dealt with directly and quickly, just as they dealt directly and quickly with the innocent people of the world.

I assumed that when we caught the three Axis leaders and their chiefs, we could also obtain their secret documents, and if we tried them according to international law, we would have to deal with them to some extent. But I did not want this step to prevent us from quickly disposing of these bandit chiefs.

I had raised this view to President Roosevelt and also to Prime Minister Churchill and Eden when they visited Moscow. I had also raised it several times in cabinet meetings. I said frankly that I thought all the war instigators from Germany, Japan, and Italy should be hanged.

During my tenure at the State Department, my views were not definitely rejected. But after I resigned from the post of Secretary of State, formal trials became favored.

But I don't want to be seen as opposing the Nuremberg trials. When it was later decided to do so, I heartily supported it. My opinion was only about different trial methods.

Almost a week after I arrived in Moscow, I said to Molotov that I did not know how to arrange a meeting with Marshal Stalin; I did not know how long I had to wait or whether I had waited too long; but if I could see his "boss", I would consider it an honor in any case. I left this matter to Molotov.

Eden had seen Stalin shortly after arriving in Moscow, but he had arranged the meeting beforehand. I had not arranged anything. My theory was that I should handle matters with Molotov and not let him think that I wanted to bypass him and contact Stalin.

Molotov very quickly informed me that Stalin would receive me at the Kremlin at 3 p.m. on October 25.

I knew that one of the main topics of our conversation would be about the proposed meeting of Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill. Before and after my arrival in Moscow, the President had been exchanging telegrams with Stalin on the issue of the meeting. In principle, it had already been agreed to hold the meeting, but an insurmountable obstacle had arisen regarding the location of the meeting.

In a telegram on October 14, the President suggested Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, or Asmara, the capital of Italian Eritrea occupied by British forces in East Africa, or Ankara, the capital of Turkey. Stalin had already suggested Tehran. The President suggested November 20 or 25 as the meeting date.

On October 17, Stalin replied that he could not accept any of the locations suggested by the President in place of Tehran. He said that it was not a question of security, which he did not worry about, but of maintaining close contact with the current offensive operations of the Soviet army. He said that his colleagues believed that these operations required him to maintain personal contact with the Supreme Command. In Tehran, this contact could be guaranteed because there were telegraph and telephone lines directly to Moscow.

The President sent me a cable on October 21, claiming that after carefully assessing the time factor and his own constitutional responsibilities, he considered Tehran impossible for him. What he meant was that he could not go to such an isolated place that he could not receive bills from Congress and send them back within ten days. Due to the mountains, Tehran was difficult to reach by plane, and it might be necessary to wait several days before flying into and out of the city.

The President said that Stalin did not show understanding of the constraints Roosevelt was under in several telegrams in response to the President. Therefore, he wanted me to deliver a telegram to Stalin and explain to him orally the definite and clear reasons why he did not want to go to Tehran, which were not due to personal preferences but were stipulated by the Constitution.

So he suggested Basra in Iraq as a substitute. Stalin could run a special telephone line from Tehran to Basra, managed by the Soviets, so he could still maintain direct contact with Inskoe.

The President argued strongly that he was willing to travel from the United States to any place within 600 miles of Soviet territory. He had to maintain a constitutional government that had been established for more than 150 years and abide by its regulations. If it were not for this, he would be willing to travel ten times the distance to meet Stalin. He concluded that if Stalin, Churchill, and himself could not meet because of a few hundred miles, future generations would consider it a tragedy.

On the afternoon of October 25, when I was sitting in front of Stalin next to an earthen-colored cabinet in the Kremlin, I explained all the points to him. Ambassador Harriman and Charles E. Bohlen were with me, while Molotov and a translator sat on either side of Stalin.

When I walked into the Marshal's office, he came in from another door, met me halfway, and shook hands. He was very sincere and approachable. He led me to my seat next to the table and sat opposite me, with his back to the wall.

Our conversation began with personal chit-chat. We exchanged views on the issue of how to plant wheat. I told Stalin that in Tennessee, wheat had to be planted six inches deep, which seemed novel to him. We discussed how to make rafts. I described how we used walnut vines to connect the wood in Tennessee. Stalin described how his people used grape vines to make rafts.

I told Stalin about my joy in coming to Moscow, and that my wish to visit his country for many years had finally come true.

I said that I had attended many international conferences in my life, but in all international conferences, I had not received more thoughtful hospitality than we had received from our hosts, the Soviet government, especially Molotov. Stalin replied that he could not have imagined such criticism.

I pointed out that one of the most important tasks of the current meeting was to lay a foundation for the meeting of himself, President Roosevelt, and Churchill, and for this meeting, all the people of our country, and in fact all the people of the world, who are engaged in the fight against Nazism and Fascism, expressed the greatest hope, so I presented to Stalin the President's telegram regarding the location of the meeting.

After reading the Russian translation, Stalin handed it to Molotov, stating that it had to be considered and discussed with his colleagues. After reading it, Foreign Minister Molotov said that important military operations were currently underway, and all the senior military and political bureaus of the Soviet government unanimously believed that Stalin absolutely could not leave, but when it was unavoidable, he could only go to a place where direct communication could be maintained every day.

So Stalin suggested that it would be best to postpone the meeting until the spring of the following year, when Fairbanks in Alaska would be a suitable location.

I said that the President and I both deeply felt that the international situation required this meeting, and if it could not be held in a timely manner, it would cause deep disappointment among the people of all Allied countries, because its influence would unite our three countries and strengthen cooperation to carry out the war and implement cooperation in the post-war period.

Stalin interjected that he was not opposed to the meeting in principle.

I replied that I understood that he was only thinking about the practical ways we were discussing.

He argued strongly that there was no question of stubbornness or prestige on his part, but he could not understand why the delay of national documents for a day or two should be so important, while an occasional mistake in military operations could not be corrected after a grammatical error, but had to be paid for with the lives of thousands of people. As far as he was concerned, the difficulty of meeting in Basra was entirely about material arrangements, especially communication.

Stalin said that he did not have any worries about the issue of security. He made this point after Ambassador Harriman said that the heads of the three countries could live in their own tents in the mountains behind Basra, defended by their own troops, thus guaranteeing complete isolation and security.

As our conversation continued for an hour—actually half an hour, because of the time required for translation—because the time for the meeting was near, I said to Stalin that because I was a student of Molotov, it was time to go to class. The Marshal smiled at me and wished us good luck.

When the discussion ended, he stood up, walked around the table, shook hands with me, and said something in Russian. His translator was still sitting at the table finishing his notes, and Stalin's words thus disappeared into thin air. The Marshal turned back to the translator and said very sharply to him that a translator's responsibility was to always be by his side (Bohlen later told me this). I then learned that Stalin had expressed great pleasure in being able to see me.

### Emergency Motion in the Senate Urges Government to Stabilize Prices, Special Committee Formed for Review This Morning

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the third day of the fifth session of the Senate. The third meeting was held in the afternoon. In addition to reports on policy implementation by the Directors of the Bureau of Health, the Bureau of Public Works, and the Bureau of Public Utilities, Senators questioned the Directors of the Bureau of Education, the Bureau of Health, and the Bureau of Public Works. The Directors of the Bureau of Education and the Bureau of Health responded. Two urgent proposals, one impromptu motion, and one discussion on an impromptu emergency motion were passed. The impromptu emergency motion was proposed by Wang Xianqing and eighteen others, "In order to alleviate the suffering of the people and adopt effective measures to fundamentally stabilize prices to reassure the people." The original listed measures are as follows: "(1) Regarding the allocation of foreign exchange and subsidies for public utilities and transportation enterprises belonging to the Central Government, urgently request the Central Government to handle them. (2) Regarding local public utilities and transportation enterprises, request the municipal government to implement them promptly. (3) Prices are rising daily, and the Central Government and the Municipal Government should rapidly address these measures in the shortest possible time." Later, because the case was of great importance and required lengthy discussion, the general meeting decided: "(1) A special review committee should be organized to review this case. The review meeting is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on February 26th in the conference room on the second floor of this council.

### Call on the National Government to Strengthen the Northeast

The remaining urgent proposals were: (1) Zhou Lianze et al. proposed "Call on the National Government to strengthen the Northeast, recover lost territory, and stabilize the situation." The resolution was passed as proposed. (2) "It is proposed that the Municipal Government order the Bureau of Civil Affairs to instruct the heads of each district and baojia to investigate the actual rent situation in each district of the city' in order to determine rent standards to stabilize residents." The method is to investigate the rent for December 1947 and January 1948 and compare it with the rent in 1937. Resolution: Request the heads of each district and baojia to complete the work within the day and publish a notice to the public. There was one impromptu motion, which was to retain Director Zhang Wei.

### Difficulties in Improvement Due to Budget Shortages, Zhang Wei Expresses Eagerness to Leave, Unanimous Impromptu Motion to Retain Him

Director Zhang of the Bureau of Health reported on his work, explaining the epidemic prevention facilities, environmental sanitation, health care services, and pharmaceutical management in detail, but due to lack of funds, although he tried his best to improve, he still failed to achieve the ideal. Taking the manure trucks as an example, 500 new trucks are needed, but there are only 200, leaving a shortage of 300. Therefore, even broken trucks must continue to be used. In terms of personnel, last year there were more than 2,000 people in all units of the bureau, but due to the low salaries, more than 500 people have left so far, and it is impossible to retain them. This is because the salaries of medical personnel, etc., are five times higher than those of civil servants if they work in other institutions. The bureau has now launched moral and cultivation training to encourage colleagues to support each other, which has seen considerable progress. Of the twelve cases resolved by the previous Senate, four have not been handled, such as the fact that a civilian hospital has not been established in the Putuo district, and the Yinxiang Hospital has not been taken over, etc. However, this is not because they have not been handled, but because they have not been completed, and they will continue to be handled in the future.

The Sins of the Bureau of Health Are All My Personal Responsibility

Finally, Director Zhang expressed his intention to leave, saying sincerely, "I speak simply, and I am also simple. I can manage to feed my family, but I cannot solve the problem of feeding thousands of families under me. I am really incompetent and want to do a good job but cannot. In the past two years, I have received a lot of guidance from you, and I am very grateful for your comfort. This may be the last time I attend the conference. Regarding the more than 9,000 employees in each unit of the bureau, it is impossible to say that there is not a single bad person, but the atmosphere has improved a lot recently, which is also thanks to everyone. For the past twenty-one months, all the sins of the Bureau of Health are my personal responsibility. I ask for everyone's forgiveness."

Senator Wu Zhengjue and seventy others were very moved by Director Zhang's words and made an impromptu motion before the adjournment: "Director Zhang of the Bureau of Health is a nationally renowned public health expert. He works hard, and it is recommended that the Mayor retain him and not let him resign." The motion was unanimously passed by the general meeting.

Why Are There No Regulations on Manure Collection Time and Fees?

Regarding the questions to the Bureau of Health, Chen Peide raised the question of why there are no regulations on the time for manure collectors to dump manure, and the fees are arbitrarily increased, disturbing the citizens. In addition, manure collectors dump manure into the sewers, which is detrimental to hygiene and should be banned. Zhang Zhongyuan asked whether the over-the-counter drugs sold publicly on the radio have been inspected by the authorities, and why they have not been banned. Qu Yue asked to pay attention to hygiene in the suburbs and to consult with the police department to allow small restaurants near entertainment venues to extend their business hours.

Negligence of Hospital Staff Should Be Given Special Attention

Jia Dechao reported that the staff of the Gongji Hospital are very arrogant and negligent. Previously, a friend was injured in the foot by a car and sought treatment at the hospital. At that time, the injury was not serious, and the nurse simply treated it, saying that he only needed to stay for a few days. However, after a few days, the bone suddenly became inflamed, and the doctor cut it off. However, due to the careless surgery, he soon became ill again, and it was cut again and again, for a total of three cuts. This kind of turning a healthy person into a cripple is really cruel, and the health authorities should pay special attention to it. In addition, the Bureau of Health did not cremate ownerless coffins but burned coffins with owners. This is a criminal offense, and it is said that families of coffins with owners pay some money and then they are not burned. I don't know if the Director is aware of this?

Garbage Accumulates on the Road, Reaching a Distance of Twenty Feet

Jiang Hao said that the garbage accumulated on the road in front of my house reached a distance of twenty feet. I saw it every day and was extremely disgusted. It had not been removed for several months. I was planning to raise it at this session of the conference, but the garbage suddenly disappeared the day before the meeting. Is there such a coincidence? Is the garbage disposal fee issued once a month or once every three months? The contractor's responsibility is to clear the garbage. If it is dumped into the river, is it not contradictory to dredging the river? Lu Huimin asked about the preparations for epidemic prevention and vaccination. He also asked to pay attention to the garbage in the alleys. Youth Party Senator Wang Zonghao said: (1) The city's public cleanliness and hygiene are very different from what was done in the concession era in the past. (2) Forced epidemic prevention work is not thorough enough. Zhou Lianze said: There is still half of the space in the small vegetable market, but the entrance is extremely crowded. The Bureau of Health has supervisors. Why don't they contact the police to ban it?

Immediately Dismiss Manure Collectors Found to Be in Violation of Regulations

Director Zhang replied to each question one by one: (1) There have always been regulations on the time for clearing manure. It is after 9:00 in the winter and after 8:00 in the summer. If you see a manure truck on the road, the police can arrest it. Later, during the winter defense period, some people impersonated manure collectors and entered the homes of citizens to rob them, so it was not convenient to do it too early. Also, because there were not enough vehicles, some people had to pull them several times, which extended the time, but we are still urging the police to pay attention at all times. There are regulations on fees. If violations are found, they will be dismissed. At the same time, citizens are asked not to give too much money. As for dumping manure into the sewers, in addition to the eight designated locations that lead directly to the manure plant, the only way to deal with lazy manure collectors who arbitrarily dump manure into the sewers is to dismiss them.

Hygiene in Suburban Areas Will Not Be Discriminated Against

(2) There are management regulations for the sale of drugs on the radio and the publication of drugs in newspapers, but it is much more difficult to manage radio stations than newspapers. We will definitely strictly enforce them in the future. (3) There will be no discrimination against cleanliness in the suburbs. The Bureau of Health has always attached importance to outdoor and indoor cleanliness and actively promoted citizen awareness. (4) Medical ethics of hospital staff. I hope everyone will pay attention to it. The Bureau of Health should pay attention to both public and private hospitals. (5) Small workers giving money for owner-occupied coffins have been found in the Yangjing district and have been dismissed.

Garbage That Has Been Accumulated for a Long Time Will Be Severely Dealt With

(6) The delay in garbage removal is due to the difficulty in exporting ships. If it is found that garbage has been accumulated for a long time, please report it to the bureau, and we will severely punish the garbage collectors. (7) Public health is indeed not as good as it was before the war, but if there were the same conditions as before the war, it would not necessarily be done worse than before the war. According to the number of people before the war, there should be more than 7,000 people working now, but there are currently only 5,000 people inside and outside the bureau. (8) We did not want to rush the epidemic prevention in the first year, but we will strengthen it this year. Vaccination will begin on March 1. The number of people vaccinated last year broke the record for any previous year. (9) We will continue to work hard to improve other situations, such as small vegetable markets, but they have already made progress compared to before.

### Freak: Born with Two Extra Arms and Two Extra Legs

[Report from Our Newspaper] On the 23rd of this month, Gan Jishi, the wife of Gan Qiqing, a villager in Chenjiazhai south of the God of Wealth Temple in Nanxiang Town on the Jinghu Line, gave birth to a freak after a full-term pregnancy. In addition to the head being no different from ordinary people, the whole body has four arms, four legs, and two reproductive organs, all of which are male (see picture). This is Gan's second child. After giving birth, she saw that it was strange and considered it very unlucky, so she let it freeze to death. The dead infant is now stored in the Huimin Couple Hospital in Nanxiang West Market for medical research.

### Education Bureau Answers Questions: Out-of-School Children Are Being Investigated, Opportunity to Study at Night Will Be Provided

The Senators continued to ask questions of the Bureau of Education the day before yesterday. Zhang Yiqu asked first, why has a national school not been established in the Old Gate district to this day? Director Li used the excuse of not being able to find a location to shirk responsibility. Has he actually looked for it? If there is never any land, will it never be established? The citizens of the Old Gate district pay the most taxes, but not a single school is established. Can the residents of the district pay 20% less taxes in the future? Lu Shidao asked why there is no national school in Yangshupu? Wang Weisi asked whether qualified teachers who have been certified have job security? What progress has been made in allocating special funds for the construction of national schools in suburban areas, as resolved at the previous conference? Qu Yue asked to quickly establish the Xinlu Normal School. Jia Dechao said, (1) Adult literacy classes should be established with 50 people. Often, they are established when the number of people is insufficient, which is a waste of money. (2) There are so many out-of-school children. How can we remedy it? Zhang Zhongyuan reported that primary school students came to solicit donations in coffee shops during the New Year. Has the Bureau of Education approved this donation? Qian Songping said that school equipment is simple and hoped that the quality would be improved. Li Shuzi said: (1) The primary school in Xinjingjiang Town has no fence. Students play and walk on the road, and vehicles are very dangerous. Not only can the school authorities not collect tuition fees, but they also have to give away books. (2) There are no mats in the classrooms of the Zhenru Xiku School. This situation proves that suburban schools have no subsidies, and the government should allocate special funds. (3) Why is the substitute teaching fee for female teachers so slow to be issued? By the time it is received, they have already had their second child.

No Vacant Land Can Be Found to Build Schools in the Old Gate District

Director Li immediately replied separately: (1) At least one school can be established in the Old Gate district this year. There is really no public land to be found. If private land can be exchanged for other public land from the Municipal Government, we are also willing to do so. After this conference, we will ask the district chief, bao chiefs, and senators of the Old Gate district to jointly plan and find a location, and funds can be requested. Zhang Yiqu was still dissatisfied with Director Li's reply and asked Mayor Wu to reply again. The Mayor said that there is only public land on Xiamen Road in the Old Gate district that can be used to build a school, but there are buildings on the land. If we forcibly demolish them, the citizens will petition. We cannot afford to buy private land. This issue can only be answered after consulting with the senators and district chiefs. Director Li replied to the questions again: (2) The Yangshupu Central Primary School will be prepared to be established after the Sports College moves to Jiangwan.

20 Billion Will Be Allocated to Help Suburban Schools

(3) We are paying attention to the rectification of private schools at any time. More than a dozen middle and primary schools have been banned. The certification of teachers gives them qualifications, but it does not necessarily give them a position. Special funds have been allocated to help suburban schools and have been approved by the Municipal Government. 20 billion will be allocated. (4) The Xinlu Normal School's school buildings were previously demolished by unscrupulous elements to build rooms. In the future, they will be required to compensate, so that they can be repaired. (5) Out-of-school children are being investigated and will be given the opportunity to study at night. Children of public school teachers are given free tuition because some institutions already have tuition loan funds, so they should not be given it again. (6) We have found out that primary school students are soliciting donations, but the school has denied it after investigation. It must be known that there are many people who impersonate students, and there are also people who impersonate parents and teachers. The bureau will try its best to ban them. (7) The substitute teaching fee is indeed delayed because the procedures are troublesome. It can be issued within a week this time.

### The Bureau of Public Works Has a Hard Time: Heavy Workload, Difficult Finances

Director Zhao Zukang of the Bureau of Public Works reported on the situation of the bureau, including eight characters, namely "Heavy Workload, Difficult Finances." As for the work in the past, under the municipal construction donation item, the first phase of 9 billion was used to build roads on a total of 14 lines, totaling more than 50,000 square meters. The second phase of funds has not been received, and it was allocated by the Municipal Government. More than 20 road lines total more than 50,000 square meters. Half of it has been completed, totaling 27,000 square meters. It is hoped that this item can be tripled in the second half of the year, that is, 54 billion will be collected, and two-thirds will be used to build roads and one-third to repair bridges. The ditches and canals are being improved, and water accumulation on Jiaozhou Road can be reduced this year. There are a total of 17 bridges over the Suzhou River, 11 of which were damaged during the war. Seven have been repaired, and the other four have not yet been completed. Wharves 1 to 9 in Nanshi have been completed, and 10 to 12 are in preparation. They can be completed after October. 2.6 million cubic meters of sludge need to be dredged from the Suzhou River. It is planned to dredge 50,000 cubic meters per month, which can be completed in three years, with a budget of 240 billion yuan. There are 800,000 cubic meters of dredging work. 240,000 were completed last year, and 240,000 can be used for work relief. By the end of March, 16 miles south of the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach can be completed for the sea wall project, and cars can pass through. The future plan is to promote urban planning in particular and speed up the construction of bridges over the Suzhou River. However, the difficulties are finances, materials, and personnel. In terms of the regular budget, it is far from enough. (1) The maintenance fee was 6.9 billion in 1946, 32 billion last year, and only 90 billion this year, which is two times less than last year and the year before. (2) The new construction fee was 9.5 billion in 1946, 54.2 billion last year, and only 36 billion this year, which is 40% less than last year. The material cost this year is 15 to 20 times higher than last year.

### Many Questions Will Be Answered Today

The senators asked questions including (1) Zhong Yuliang asked why Pudong Avenue is not built. If there are not enough funds, a part can be built first. (2) Zhang Xuelian said that the potholes on Longhua Road are filled with mud. Can this be improved? (3) Shao Yongsheng said that Guihua Road is like a muddy road, and you have to wear galoshes even on sunny days. (4) Shan Ming asked when the north-south trunk road of Longhua will begin construction? The work relief project in Puhui Pond has not completed 20% of the work after one and a half months of construction. This will affect the spring plowing. (5) Zhang Zhihan asked why the private land in Pudong that was requisitioned for road construction has not been compensated. Residents plan to destroy the road, and the authorities should pay attention. (6) Jiang Huaishu said that the road surface near Pingwang Street on Fuzhou Road is very narrow, and the houses protrude. Why are they not demolished? Director Zhao will answer today because there was not enough time yesterday.

### Today's Agenda

The agenda for the fourth meeting this afternoon is as follows: The Director of the Bureau of Public Works will answer questions. Question and answer session with the Bureau of Public Utilities. Work reports from the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Bureau of Police, and the Bureau of Social Affairs. Reports from representatives of each district chief and representatives of the district people's congress. If time permits, questions and answers will be asked to the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Bureau of Police, and the Bureau of Social Affairs.

### Aircraft Raise Freight Rates Case, Interrogation of Personnel of Two Companies, It Is Said That There Is No Fixed Air Freight Rate

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of the Beijing office of China and Central Airlines being accused of raising freight rates without authorization was heard in court yesterday by the District Prosecutor's Office. In the morning, the prosecutor summoned Jiang Nengxiang, chief of the cargo and mail section of China Airlines, Liu Anping, acting business director, and Xu Xin, director of the Beijing office. As a result, they were each ordered to submit a written guarantee of 500 million yuan. In the afternoon, the prosecutor summoned Zha Zhenhu, deputy general manager of Central Airlines, and Deng Gaozhang, director of the operations group. Zha and Deng were both respondents and were ordered to return. It is reported that the content of yesterday's interrogation was (1) whether freight rates were raised without authorization, and (2) whether the names of Heji and Huamao Transportation Companies were fictitious. The defendants and respondents said that air freight rates are not fixed. According to custom, the rates are determined based on cost. As for the higher freight rates between Beijing and Taiyuan, it is because merchants often charter planes back and forth between Beijing, and the freight is calculated on the basis of round trip. Even if the plane flies back empty, the freight must be paid. Outsiders do not understand the truth, which has caused misunderstandings. The prosecutor immediately ordered Central Airlines to submit the Ministry of Transportation's order regarding the regulation of freight rates to the District Prosecutor's Office for reference. Among the defendants in the case, Xu Xin, director of the Beijing office of China Airlines, is suspected of being more serious. The court will continue to hear the case this morning. The director of the Beijing office of Central Airlines did not attend due to illness.

### Refugees in the Third Refugee Shelter Still Can't Get Enough to Eat, Mayor Wu Visited with Senators Yesterday, All Knelt Down and Begged

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Third Refugee Shelter on Jungong Road in this city has been open for two months, but because the management is not perfect, when Speaker Pan and his wife visited last time, many refugees shouted "We can't get enough to eat" and knelt down and begged, which was very pitiful. Various newspapers have also criticized it a lot. Mayor Wu is very concerned and went to visit yesterday morning with Director Wu Kaixian of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Senators Shao Yongsheng, Yao Baozhen, Tong Lian, and Huang Zhensheng.

The weather was clear yesterday. When Mayor Wu and his party went there, the refugees were gathering outside in the sun. There were more than 700 refugees in total, divided into children's groups, men's groups, and women's groups. When the Mayor arrived, they all stood up and paid their respects. The children's group shouted "Long live the Republic of China" while clapping their hands, which was obviously trained in advance. In addition to visiting the Third Refugee Shelter, Mayor Wu also went to Jiangwan to visit the work relief refugee shelter and expressed his satisfaction with the refugees who were dredging the river for work relief.

This reporter was the second time to visit the Third Refugee Shelter yesterday. I felt that the facilities had been significantly improved. For example, refugees used to drink raw water, but yesterday there was hot water available. Refugees used to be scantily clad, and the bedrooms were full of stench, but yesterday they were all wearing gray cotton socks and trousers, and the bedrooms were also disinfected, and everyone had a snow-white towel around their neck. One refugee child specially told the reporter: This towel was given by Speaker Pan's wife.

This reporter arrived an hour earlier than Mayor Wu yesterday. According to a refugee woman who secretly told the reporter: "We still can't get enough to eat. We only have two meals a day, and we are only allowed to eat a little more than one bowl for each meal, but we don't dare to say it. Whoever says it will be beaten..." At this time, an office worker from the shelter was seen coming, and the refugee woman stopped talking immediately. The reporter hoped to understand the truth and wanted to talk to a few refugees, but because the office worker was always with them, the refugees did not dare to speak. As soon as the office worker left, the refugees rushed to tell the reporter. It is said that the two meals are both half-wet and half-dry, and they can't eat two bowls each, so they are really hungry. Whoever tells outsiders that "we can't get enough to eat" will be "punished", so when Mayor Wu came, we didn't dare to tell the truth.

When Mayor Wu visited the women's group and the children's group yesterday, the women and children did not say anything, but when he passed the men's group, someone in the refugees shouted "Kneel down and sue Mayor Wu", and then they all knelt down, thumped their chests, wiped their tears, cried bitterly, and shouted "We can't get enough to eat". The office workers around Mayor Wu said: "We have two meals of dry rice every day, two bowls per person. We should be able to get enough to eat. You can tell from the faces of the refugees." Mayor Wu was unable to cope for a while.

According to the director of the shelter, the food standard for refugees is two dou of rice per person per month, and the vegetable fee is 2,000 yuan per person per day, which is indeed not enough. It is said that it is expected to increase slightly from today, so the management of refugees in the future may be improved.

### Rice Distribution Can Be Implemented Before the 10th of Next Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] The matter of expanding the organization of the Civil Food Allocation Committee in this city will be implemented after the official central government document arrives within the day. Ren Xianqun will serve as the chairman. Ren gathered relevant parties at his private residence yesterday afternoon to discuss the technical issues of comprehensive rice distribution in this city and study the rice distribution procedures. It is said that the rice distribution date is planned to be advanced. The purchase certificates are being printed in a hurry. The citizens of Shanghai will be able to purchase one dou of rice with their certificates on March 10. According to Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs, the rice price is calculated at 95% of the average market price for the last five days of last month.

### Sugar Distribution for the Tenth Period Can Be Distributed Around March 20

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sugar Group of the Shanghai Municipal Price Review Committee held its 22nd review meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday morning. The chairman was Gu Bingyuan, and the resolutions are as follows: Sugar distribution will be held for six periods this year, one period every two months. The tenth period of sugar distribution will be based on the population in January, the eleventh period will be based on the population in March, and so on. Each person will still be allocated one catty per period. The distribution price for the tenth period of sugar distribution will be calculated at 60% of the distribution price of 13,500 yuan in January, which is 8,000 yuan per catty. After adding the fees for district baojia, transportation, and sugar certificate printing, the retail price will be 12,000 yuan per catty, and it will be distributed around March 20.

### Jardine Brewery Director, German, Robbed and Beaten to Death, Cook Suspected and Detained

[Report from Our Newspaper] Leiner, a German, 61 years old, the director and engineer of Jardine Brewery at 350 Dinghai Road, Pudong, has been working in the factory for 13 years. His wife, Anna Leiner, 57 years old, lives in the factory on the fourth floor. Last night at around 10 pm, Anna had already gone to sleep, and Leiner was typing a letter to his daughter in the room. Unexpectedly, five gangsters broke in. Three of them covered their faces with cloth and climbed up the stairs from the wasteland behind, opened the door of the fourth floor, threatened with guns, and handcuffed Leiner backwards, tying him to the handrail of the stairs. His wife, Anna, was also dragged up and forced to hand over gold bars and jewelry. Leiner refused and was brutally beaten by the gangsters. His wife reluctantly opened the safe and was robbed of 60 taels of gold, seven large and small diamond rings, and 1,750 US dollars, with an estimated loss of more than 100 million yuan, and fled with the stolen goods. However, Leiner eventually fell to the ground due to his injuries and died shortly after. Anna suffered from neurasthenia and also fainted. It was not until after 12 o'clock in the middle of the night that she woke up and reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station. The police station immediately sent officers to investigate. It is reported that a cook is suspected and has been detained. The escaped criminals are being pursued.

### International Black Market Gold Bullion Case: Fourteen Chinese and Foreign Defendants Interrogated; Records Unsigned; Liao Quanqi Retracts Testimony; Ye Jinyuan and Two Others Granted Bail

[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Syrian national Mike Doe and others operating a black market for gold bullion was heard in court yesterday morning. The defendants present were Mike Doe, Liao Quanqi, Xue Lianhuang, Ye Jinyuan, Ye Defa, Ma Weiheng, Huang Fuhan, Zheng Jiayu, Lin Shangzhen, Zhong Jinding, Chen Dongliang, Yang Jiqian, Tang Jinshui, and Ma Tailia (female), totaling fourteen individuals. Mike Doe and Liao Quanqi, considered the most heavily implicated, were questioned for an extended period by Judge Zhu Yuhuang yesterday. According to Mike Doe's testimony, he had known Liao Quanqi for a year, during which time they traded in stocks, not gold bullion. He claimed that Mike Doe Trading Company was solely his own venture and that the gold bars found on him were collateral for loans, not for speculation. Liao Quanqi testified that the seventeen gold bars seized were his own. He denied his previous statement to the police that the bars belonged to Ma Xianglin, claiming that the statement was made with the consent of all fourteen individuals. He denied all his statements made at the police station, stating that he had not signed the records, attempting to retract his testimony entirely. Ma Tailia, found with US$263.25 on her person, also denied engaging in trading. Defendants Ye Jinyuan and Ye Defa, who were in custody, admitted to delivering gold bars to Liao Quanqi on two occasions: one bar the first time and four and a half bars the second time. All other defendants denied participating in the black market gold bullion operation. The court ordered that Ye Jinyuan and Ye Defa, who were in custody, be released on bail with written guarantees of 500 million yuan each. The remaining defendants were released on their original bail, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.

### War Criminals Sentenced in Batches; Zhongye Jiuyong to be Tried Tomorrow

### Captured Bandit Tang Jingyan and Others Interrogated by Garrison Headquarters Personnel

[Report from this Newspaper] Tang Jingyan and six others, remnants of Ding Xishan's forces and self-proclaimed "Deputy Commander of the Jiangnan People's Liberation Army," have been interrogated by personnel dispatched from the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters for several days.

### Disturbance at Qibao Lantern Festival; Workers and Villagers Clash

Approximately 300 workers dredging the Puhuitang River in Qibao Township clashed violently with villagers at Tangwan Village, Bridge No. 7, over the forced seizure of chickens and ducks at around 9:00 PM the night before last. Thirty ringleaders among the foremen and workers were detained and handed over to the Longhua Police Station. Injured villagers Ma Buxiang and Ma Qin were transported to the Eighth Municipal Hospital.

### Zhao Zengjue Expresses Pessimism, Claims This is the Last Meeting

Bureau of Public Utilities Director Zhao Zengjue's work report briefly stated that construction work is underway on the waterworks, with water currently supplied by artesian wells and large reservoirs. The truck ferry transports approximately 60 vehicles across the river daily. Suburban telephone services have been installed in eight locations, including Nanxiang and Dachang. Three towns, including Beiqiao, remain unequipped, and discussions are underway with the Telecommunications Bureau to expedite the process. Regarding electricity, the establishment of a Joint Power Company is the fundamental solution. The immediate solution is to task the power companies with increasing power generation, while also encouraging textile mills with machinery to generate their own electricity. The Shanghai Electric Power Company was originally slated to receive a 160,000-kilowatt generator, but due to the urgent needs in Europe, the United States has prioritized supplying Europe first. The Hwashang Electric Plant also planned to install three 2,000-kilowatt generators, but they have not yet been delivered due to transportation difficulties. Conserving electricity is truly necessary. For example, during the recent severe cold, residents used electric heaters, consuming an additional 19,000 kilowatts of electricity in a single day, causing textile mills to shut down. With current conservation efforts, 7,000 kilowatts can be saved daily. Without conservation, industrial power consumption would decrease by 26,000 kilowatts daily, accounting for 22% of the total, potentially affecting the jobs of 130,000 workers. Adjusting public utility prices is also a concern for me as a citizen, but the companies' inability to sustain themselves must also be considered.

Director Zhao concluded by expressing his inability to continue, stating that he had previously resigned to the mayor, who repeatedly urged him to stay. However, due to the recent surge in prices and his inability to properly account for them to the citizens, he is resigning again. This is his last meeting with everyone.

Due to time constraints, the Q&A session regarding the Bureau of Public Utilities will be postponed to this afternoon.

### Fashion Company Owner Dies Over Woman; Gambling Den Boss During Enemy Occupation; Main Culprit Xia Shikui Fled to Hong Kong; Two Courts Investigating the Same Murder Case

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhao Hewu, owner of the Meihua Fashion Company at 520 Linsen Middle Road, was murdered on November 18 last year in Caowang Township, Panjia Bridge, Jiading County. The murderer escaped in a black-market car with license plate 17734. The car belonged to Xia Shikui of 150 Guangyuan Road in this city. After investigation by relevant authorities, the inside story of the case came to light. Zhao's wife, Xia Manli, is related to Xia Shikui, a major rogue during the enemy occupation. Xia operated the Tongqing gambling den in the Nanshi district, the leading gambling den at the time. Xia cohabited with a beautiful croupier. Later, this croupier became involved with Zhao Hewu, which was discovered by Xia, who then plotted to kill him. After the incident, Xia fled, reportedly to Hong Kong. The murderer, Xu Liangtu, was apprehended by the Sixth Investigation Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters and transferred to the Jiading Court. Another murderer, Ma Qiang, is still at large. Recently, the deceased's mother, Zhao Shi, filed a petition with the District Procuratorate, requesting that the murderer Xu Liangtu be transferred to Shanghai for prosecution and that the fugitive murderers be apprehended. The District Procuratorate dispatched bailiffs to Xia Shikui's residence and Xia Yunkui's residence at 61 Xiafei Fang, but both had already fled. The case is currently under investigation by the District Procuratorate. However, the Jiading Court is also investigating the case, and it remains to be decided where the case will ultimately be handled.

[Report from this Newspaper] At around 8:00 AM yesterday, Lu Bao Cai, a farmer from Nantong residing at 23 Zhulongbang, west of Huangxing Road in Hudong, discovered a female corpse in a wasteland. The deceased was approximately 30 years old. Lu reported the discovery to the Maqiao Police Station of the Xinshi Street Police Bureau, which in turn reported it to the Xinshi Street Sub-Bureau. Wang Zhaoxin, Chief of the Sub-Bureau, instructed Liu Lianfang, Chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, along with officers Du Shuen, Du Shufan, and others, to investigate.

### Severe Spring Famine in Shandong

[Report from Our Correspondent in Jinan on the 22nd] No province's spring famine problem is more concerning than Shandong's. Seemingly, there has never been a more severe spring famine in Shandong than this year. Although, on the surface, the government controls 41 counties and 3 municipalities in Shandong's 107 counties and 3 municipalities, in reality, both the occupied areas and the recovered areas suffered widespread drought and war disasters last year. Furthermore, Southern and Western Shandong experienced so-called floods and wind disasters.

According to Director of the Shandong Reconstruction Office Ding Jishi and our reporter, before the war, Shandong had

100 million mu of arable land.

However, in the southwestern areas of Shandong alone, the area flooded last year reached 3 million mu, accounting for one-thirtieth of the province's arable land. This is not a small number. Furthermore, the war disasters that have permeated the entire province during the eight years of resistance against Japan and the two years of internal conflict, especially the destruction, liquidation, and struggles by the communists, have pushed the entire rural area to the brink of collapse.

According to a survey conducted by the Shandong Reconstruction Office last May in 18 counties and cities, including Jinan, Licheng, Qihe, Puxian, Renping, Gaotang, Qingping, Enxian, Tengxian, Boxing, Zouping, Changqing, Laiwu, Zichuan, Linqu, Zhucheng, Anqiu, and Shouguang, the total average loss of agricultural resources was as follows: manpower loss reached slightly less than 55%, arable land abandonment reached slightly more than 41%, draft animal loss reached slightly more than 70%, livestock loss reached slightly more than 69%, large agricultural implement loss reached slightly more than 51%, and small agricultural implement loss reached slightly more than 45%. Although this is only partial statistical data, it is not difficult to infer the extent of destruction that the rural areas of Shandong have suffered.

Those who have traveled in the newly recovered areas or "liberated areas," especially in the Yimeng Mountains region, all feel that food and lodging are their

greatest threats.

The reason is that travelers in these areas often do not see a single person or complete house for dozens of miles. The fields are barren, and wild grasses are rampant. Even if one or two relatively complete houses are found, their doors are sealed with bricks and earth, and there is no one inside. It is said that the owners of these houses, unable to maintain their livelihoods, gather their meager belongings, seal the doors and windows, put their children on small carts, and lead their families on a hopeless flight to escape the famine! In reality, they are already too poor to even eat sweet potato stems or wild grass elm bark. The weaker ones either commit suicide individually or even commit suicide as a family. The more resilient ones either "exchange children for food and break up bones for fuel" or embark on the path of "escape" and "famine relief!"

The Shandong Provincial Government is aware of the severity of this year's

spring famine.

In addition to the concrete plans already drafted by the Department of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Social Relief and Rehabilitation to establish soup kitchens and reception centers throughout Shandong to show their commitment to relief, the Reconstruction Office has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Water Resources and received approval for an additional 1.8 billion yuan in funds for the

Chouxihui

project (and plans to request an additional 6 billion yuan to complete the entire project). 5 billion yuan will be used for the embankment restoration of the Southern Grand Canal from Shizhuang east of Nanyang Lake, passing Yan Village and circling Jining City to the Wuliying east of Machang Lake. All of the above will be used for work-for-food programs. In addition, the Relief and Rehabilitation Corps will allocate 15 tons of food in Zhangqiu for work-for-food to assist in repairing the Xiuhui Canal, and another 90 tons of food will be allocated in Jining for work-for-food to assist in repairing the Southern Grand Canal. It is estimated that by May this spring, the section of the

Xiuhui Canal from Chuanwangzhuang to Lijiatang in Zhangqiu will be completed,

which can irrigate more than 15,000 mu of land. If the entire 20-kilometer canal is completed, it can irrigate 80,000-90,000 mu of land. After the Southern Grand Canal embankment restoration project is completed, at least 800,000 mu of land between the Yun, Si, and Fu rivers and around the city of Jining, the Machang Lake area, and the banks of the Guang River, which were originally flooded, can be transformed into fertile farmland.

Currently, the biggest difficulties for the people are two: instability and poverty. They are so poor that they lack seeds, fertilizer, agricultural implements, and labor. The former depends on the increase in the number of regular national troops and the reconstruction of local armed forces. The latter is limited by the fact that the Shandong Provincial Government can only allocate agricultural implements and seeds for a maximum of 150,000 mu of land this year.

The biggest hope

is: (1) Request the Central Government to include Shandong in the list of production-increasing provinces, as with Hebei, and increase agricultural loans. (2) Request the Central Government to allocate a portion of the funds from the sale of 125,000 tons of US relief supplies to Shandong for agricultural rehabilitation. (3) Request the Central Government to allocate more relief supplies for work-for-food programs.

In recent days, approximately 60,000 personnel, the remnants of Chen Yi's First, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Column and the Two Guangzong Team cadre members, have successively fled from Henan, Hubei, and Anhui back to the Yuncheng, Juye, and Chengwu areas in southwestern Shandong. Adding the Tenth and Eleventh Columns, which originally remained in the area between Cao County and Shan County and to its east, there are a total of seven columns. The general view on Chen Bandit's

return flight

is that they are returning to replenish troops and rest and reorganize. However, some people are uneasy about whether the Jinpu Railway's Xuji section, which has been open for only ten weeks, will meet the same fate as the Jiaoji Railway did at this time last year. However, based on the principle of "sufficient food and troops," Chen Yi's maximum extent will only be to damage the Xuji section, but he will definitely not have greater ambitions or stay longer in the areas along the Xuji line, in the Yimeng Mountains area, or in other areas of Shandong. The reason is that the communist bandits, without a base supply system, cannot afford to supply such a large field army in the currently impoverished rural areas of Shandong. For the same reason, perhaps in the spring and summer, when the wheat seedlings mature, it will be the time for the main communist forces to formally flee back to Shandong and carry out large-scale looting. At that time, the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway will probably enter the most tense and difficult stage since it opened. (Our Special Correspondent Li Tian)

### Lanzhou Broadcasting Station Completed

[Report from Lanzhou on the 25th] After the completion of the new building for the Lanzhou Broadcasting Station, the 10,000-watt medium-wave transmitter has officially begun broadcasting.

### Lantern Festival in Lanzhou

[Report from Lanzhou on the 25th] This year's Farmers' Day, which was combined with the Lantern Festival, was solemnly held in the Guanshi area on the 24th. At this time when half of the country is suffering and countless lives are lost, the people of Gansu can still live and work in peace, all thanks to the efforts of the National Army soldiers. Therefore, there were many donations during the Spring Festival to support the troops, which have been remitted separately. Outer counties have also telegraphed the results of their efforts to support the troops and comfort the families of soldiers on expeditions, which are generally good. Most precious is the donation of a set of self-made automobile parts "Pei Siding" by a person named "Guanshi Laborer," whose original letter stated: "I have no money, but I have labor. I made some finished products and will donate them to the Social Affairs Office for labor to support the troops," which is deeply moving!

The fellow provincial associations mobilized folk performances a few days ago to celebrate the first Farmer's Day of the constitutional year. The performances included "Gaotai Tiexinzi" by the Shanxi Fellow Association, "Henan Lion" by the Henan Fellow Association, folk performances by the Linxia Fellow Association, and folk performances by local townships and associations. Each was unique. The streets of Lanzhou had become a sea of people. Wherever the performances passed, there was a surge of people. The drumming was deafening. Under the clear breeze and bright moon at night, singers sang Taiping songs, beating drums and howling to the sky. The government also adapted folk songs such as "Fight the Bandits," "Send Off the Elder Brother," "Sigh Five Watches," "Taiping Drum," and "New Kite Flying" to express the people's hatred for the troublemakers and to call on everyone to consolidate the northwest frontier, maintain local peace, and build a unified new China.

The Farmer's Day event was held on the 24th in front of the Martyrs' Shrine in Zhongshan Forest, with over 20,000 people participating. Afterwards, a great parade to suppress the rebellion was held, with all agencies, groups, national soldiers, self-defense forces, and all folk performances participating. This mighty flow went east from the Martyrs' Shrine, entered Zhongzheng Gate, and passed through Linsen Road, Yunting Road, and Zhonghua Road before disbanding in Central Square. At the same time, the Civil Education Hall also held a agricultural products exhibition. The poetry riddle society organized by local celebrities prepared over 5,000 riddle strips and thousands of prizes, which were hung at the south entrance of Drum Tower every night, attracting many people to guess.

### Sui Province Combines Farmers' Day and Lantern Festival, Showing a Scene of Peace and Prosperity

[Report from Gui Sui on the 25th] The Farmers' Day and Lantern Festival in Sui Province were combined, and yesterday the city of Gui Sui was filled with singing and dancing. The performances of the Four Townships and the various districts and departments totaled fifty units, and the procession on the streets stretched for ten miles. From 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM, vehicles could not pass. The movie theaters and theaters on the bustling streets performed three shows to entertain the farmers from the Four Townships, with each ticket costing 2,000 yuan. Lantern Festival customers still complained that it was not sweet enough. The 100,000 citizens almost forgot the situation in Chahar and Sui after the Asianization of the Northeast situation. According to the elders, this year's Lantern Festival is as enthusiastic as it was eleven years ago after the recovery of Bailing Temple and before the arrival of the Japanese invaders.

### After Deng Meikui Was Murdered, Xiao Xun and Others Petitioned for a Thorough Investigation

[Report from Changsha on the 25th] The murder of Deng Meikui, a tenant farmer leader in Yiyang, has been of concern to Liu Xuru, Director of the Provincial Department of Social Affairs, and Xiao Xun, Director of the Land Administration Bureau. On the 23rd, they jointly telegraphed the Yiyang County Government and petitioned Chairman Wang to instruct on the direction of the investigation. Xiao told reporters: "Rent reduction is a struggle, and sacrifice in struggle is normal. However, Deng's sacrifice this time is too tragic. The rent reduction movement in Hunan may require several more bloodsheds to succeed, so Deng's death may not be without value."

### Arrest of Three Military Officers Stationed in Wuxi for Illegally Obtaining Military Rice

[Special Dispatch from Our Wuxi Correspondent, 24th] Cai Xiong, a warrant officer and special service chief of a certain unit stationed in Wuxi, a native of Fuling, Sichuan, 28 years old, lived an extravagant life and spent money recklessly. At the beginning of last month, he conspired with Zhu Qin, a sergeant clerk in the same company, and Zeng Jishen, a sergeant squad leader, to illegally obtain military rations. They immediately forged a notification form from the Joint Logistics Headquarters' Wuxi 367th sub-station and the station chief's seal. They prepared three forged forms, totaling 8,950 catties of medium-grade rice. Zeng and Zhu then went to the Minfeng Rice Mill, a rice distribution point entrusted by the Ximen sub-station, to collect the aforementioned military rice. At the beginning of this month, Zeng again independently collected 1,250 catties. It was not until the recent accounting that the matter was discovered. It was reported to the military police for investigation. The team arrested Cai and the other two culprits on separate days before yesterday. All confessed to the aforementioned facts. The military police team, believing that Cai and the others conspired to forge documents and seals and illegally obtain military rations, with conclusive evidence, prepared a document yesterday, along with relevant personnel, and submitted it to the regiment headquarters for transfer to the Nanjing Military Police Headquarters for legal action.

### Chu Tong Warship Bombards Remnant Bandits

[Special Dispatch from Our Jiangyin Correspondent, 24th] Recently, bandit activity in northern Jiangsu has been rampant. They intercept merchant ships on the Si Dunzi river surface in Jingjiang, disrupting water transportation. The Huaqian freighter, which was towing wooden boats from Hankou, and the Feitai freighter of the Deutai Company at the port were both robbed, further emboldening the bandits. At about 11:00 PM on the 23rd, the Chu Tong warship stationed in the port, in coordination with the land fortress troops, sent two naval squads, led by Deputy Commander Lin, aboard two merchant ships for patrol. As they approached the Si Dunzi river surface, they saw two civilian boats sailing out of the port, following them, attempting to rob them. The navy opened fire, killing six bandits in the boats. As the navy towed the captured bandit boats back, they were strafed by machine guns from the shore by bandit troops only a few miles away, who then pursued them by boat, creating a tense situation. The Chu Tong warship dispatched the No. 3 and No. 5 gunboats to join the battle. At the same time, the land fortress artillery also assisted in firing, and the two sides exchanged artillery fire in a fierce battle lasting two hours. The navy won a great victory. In this battle, one bandit soldier, Wang Xiaowenzi, was captured alive, six were killed, and one rifle and one automatic weapon were seized, as well as a large number of bandit tax receipts and resistance currency. At the time of the battle, the Jiangnan area was holding a grand lantern festival. Suddenly hearing the sound of gunfire nearby, the atmosphere became tense. The market continued as usual, but a curfew was imposed early to prevent accidents.

### New Trends in Hong Kong: Domestic Industries Relocate to Hong Kong to Find a Way Out; British Capital Flows to Australia for Development

[Special Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Correspondent, 22nd] Today can be said to be the season for impoverished Britons to engage in bountiful harvests. The following two news items were published simultaneously in the Hong Kong newspapers on the 20th of this month:

(1) Mr. Haliman, the former vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, gave a speech in Sydney today, predicting that British capital will shift from Hong Kong to Australia... I have already transferred my private business to Australia.

(2) Industrialists from Shanghai are flocking to Hong Kong to establish large-scale factories. Recently, there are about fourteen or fifteen units, including seven yarn factories, which have already purchased land and are starting to build factories. Among those that have already started production after relocating from Shanghai, there are the Danan Yarn Factory and the Meiqi Chemical Factory. The larger-scale "Hong Kong Yarn Factory" is expected to start operations in about two months.

The Safest Country

These two news items reveal an important current trend in Hong Kong: domestic industries are moving to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong funds are moving to Australia. This article will briefly explain these two points.

Regarding the movement of British capital from Hong Kong to Australia, according to Haliman: Australia is the safest country. This is true not only in the Pacific region but also in the world. In a future Third World War, it may be impossible to find another place as safe as Australia. From an economic point of view, the value of the Australian pound is also quite strong. Australia has a vast land with a sparse population and abundant resources, so there is no need to worry about capital having "no place to use its heroism." Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, a large number of British women, children, and elderly people were evacuated from Hong Kong and China to Australia. After the war, although they returned to Hong Kong, that fertile land left a deep impression on them. Today, since they cannot stand their ground in mainland China, and with Britain facing austerity measures, the Middle East fraught with tension, India changing color, and Malaya in a precarious situation, Australia naturally becomes an ideal destination, apart from going to the unfamiliar Canada across the Pacific.

British People Sell Properties

As early as the beginning of 1947, British capital had already been quietly flowing out of Hong Kong. British people began selling their properties in Hong Kong and their shares in major public utilities or large commercial firms (they increased their original shares by four or five times, such as the tram company, which increased its capital from 2 million yuan to 10 million yuan, and then sold them). They absorbed a large amount of cash. Coincidentally, domestic capital was flowing into Hong Kong at that time, meeting their hungry appetites. According to estimates by people in Hong Kong's economic circles: in the past year, the proceeds from the sale of properties and shares in Hong Kong by British people amounted to approximately 50 million to 150 million yuan, of which at least half flowed into Australia.

Under the trend of British capital flowing out of Hong Kong, several large buildings in Central have changed hands. The Asia Building, which had its top floor bombed during the war, suddenly stopped construction while being rebuilt. However, not far from the Asia Building, a "Victory Building" has sprung up, and the Prince's Building diagonally opposite has added two floors. What a strong contrast! The relocation of domestic industries to Hong Kong can also be said to be domestic industries expanding to Hong Kong to find a way out, which has been evident since "August 23rd" (likely referring to the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis). The Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Tianchu MSG Factory, Xinya Glass Factory, Jiehe Steel Factory, etc., have successively come to Hong Kong to open branch factories, which has caused the original industrialists in Hong Kong to look at them with new eyes.

A Glimpse of Emerging Industries

The emerging industries in Hong Kong after the war are mainly yarn factories. The Danan Yarn Factory, which has already started production, has 5,000 spindles and produces 12 bales of yarn per day. The Hong Kong Yarn Factory, which is about to start production, has 8,000 spindles and produces 18 bales of yarn per day. There are also two spinning factories that have been built and are undergoing registration, with even larger scales, each with 15,000 spindles and producing 30 bales of yarn per day. There are more than 300 large and small textile factories in Hong Kong, each needing about 4,000 to 5,000 bales of yarn per month. If those four yarn factories start production successively, they can supply the needs of Hong Kong's textile factories without relying on external sources. Opening yarn factories in Hong Kong has the convenience of raw materials and electricity, but there is a lack of skilled workers, and wages are also quite high. No wonder a domestic industrial magnate said: "Relocating Shanghai factories to Hong Kong is a last resort."

Factories Besides Yarn Factories

In addition to yarn factories, Hong Kong will also have large oil refineries, woolen yarn factories, chemical factories, glass factories, machinery factories, and shipyards appearing or being newly established. According to statistics in October last year, there were a total of 811 large and small factories that were granted factory licenses by the Hong Kong government. By January of this year, the number of registered large and small factories had increased to 1,207, with 923 located on the Kowloon Peninsula and 284 in Hong Kong. There are approximately 300 to 400 factories that have not yet been registered. This shows the considerable progress of light industry in Hong Kong after the war, and the main driving force behind it is the relocation of domestic industries, some of which are also the relocation of British industries in Shanghai.

A Win-Win Calculation

Our country's industries are moving to Hong Kong to find a way out, while British capital is flowing to Australia for development. On the surface, it is easy to misunderstand this as a preliminary sign of British people abandoning Hong Kong. However, the reality is not as pleasant as imagined. According to people familiar with the situation in Hong Kong, this move by the British is a strategy of retreating to advance. They have seen that China's human and financial resources have been pouring into Hong Kong with overwhelming force in the past two or three years. They are taking advantage of this "opportunistic moment" to use those abundant human and financial resources to develop this largest trading outlet in southern China, and even to decorate its beauty. They are handing over this task to the Chinese to manage themselves, while extracting their own strength to develop new targets. This is a win-win calculation.

A Central Policy

The current work of the Hong Kong government is mainly to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar and the tranquility of social order. From the Hong Kong government's recent decision to expand urban construction plans to holding civil servant examinations and regulating school fees, tracing back to the initial period after Japan's surrender, how the Hong Kong government broke the market deadlock, how it distributed food, and how it restricted prices... all originated from a central policy, that is, to place Hong Kong under efficient administrative management, attract China's human and financial resources in turmoil, and operate and develop this last remaining stronghold of the British in China after a century of vicissitudes.

A foreign observer said that after the war, the British came to Hong Kong again as "housekeepers." Now that China's industrial circles are transferring to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's British capital is flowing into Australia, it can be said to be the achievements of the "housekeepers'" hard work, and it can also be considered a bountiful harvest for the impoverished British in the Far East after the war!

### Social Affairs Bureau Sold 13,000 Piculs of Rice Yesterday, but the Market Surge Has Not Abated.  Rice Sales Will Continue Until Full Rationing is Implemented.

[Our Correspondent] Rice prices fluctuated again yesterday, and the Social Affairs Bureau resumed selling rice in the market. Director Wu said: The rice sales will continue until full rice rationing is implemented in March to reduce public panic. The food situation should improve after full rice rationing is implemented on March 1st. Rationing certificates are currently being printed around the clock by the Central Daily News using a drum printer and will be issued soon. Regarding the expansion of the Civil Food Distribution Committee, he discussed it with Mayor Wu yesterday morning. After the official document from the Executive Yuan arrives in the next few days, Ren Xianqun will formally take office as the chairman.

Yesterday, the amount of rice registered as arriving in the South Market was 2,581 piculs, and in the North Market, it was 1,261 piculs. Because the authorities enforced a price limit of 2.25 million yuan for market transactions and 2.4 million yuan for door-to-door sales, prices at the production areas were higher than in this city, so very little trading was done. Prices outside the market reached over 2.6 million yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau sold 12,989 piculs of rice in the market at a price of 2.25 million yuan, distributed to 2,075 rice stores. Therefore, off-market trading has not been eliminated, and prices continue to rise. The morning market yesterday was the strongest. White japonica rice once reached 2.6 million yuan, but later fell slightly to 2.55 million yuan. Thin indica rice was 2.5 million yuan, and early indica rice was 2.48 million yuan, each higher than the previous day by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.

Flour

The opening was quite stable. Hongfeng Jiancheng flour initially saw a decline because the factory had made an offering the previous day, but it rebounded again due to the rise in rice prices. Bingchuan flour initially opened at 1.29 million yuan and then rose to 1.3 million yuan. Lao Che flour rose from 1.3 million yuan to 1.31 million yuan. Hongfeng Jiancheng also opened at 1.25 million yuan and closed at 1.28 million yuan, each rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market trend can be described as stable and strong. Wheat bran hovered at high prices. Fuxin large-package bran closed at 800,000 yuan, and the wheat factory priced it at 1.75 million yuan.

Cooking Oil

Trading only opened at the close due to the persistence of both buyers and sellers. Soybean oil was firm and had few sellers. Vegetable oil was relatively stable, with scattered sellers, and prices fell slightly. The three factories of Dayou, Dachang, and Changde jointly offered 300 units of soybean oil, and there were still many unsatisfied buyers. The price remained at 5.9 million yuan. Jitong vegetable oil was approximately 100,000 yuan lower, opening at 6.5 million yuan, but the later market was very strong. Other cooking oils were rarely offered. Recycled vegetable oil was 5.8 million yuan, and small-batch sesame oil was stable. Soybean cakes initially fell and then rose.

Grains

Varied greatly. Corn was the most popular. The price of soybeans had risen excessively for days. Although merchant groups were bidding, they were still hesitant, and there were not a few sellers taking advantage of the high prices to sell. Hankou Zha soybeans opened in the morning at 1.5 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan. The downward trend became even weaker after entering the market, falling to 1.45 million yuan. Finally, due to the rebound in oil prices and soybean cakes, it rose again to 1.5 million yuan. Although the Tianjin merchant group did not bid for sesame, the sellers were also unwilling to sell at low prices. Jiujiang milk sesame opened at 2.9 million yuan, a slight decrease of 50,000 yuan. Hankou secondary white sesame opened at 3.25 million yuan. Shelled peanuts were absorbed by the Guangdong merchant group and rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. The Qingdao merchant group continuously made progress in corn, and the inventory in this city was not abundant. Qidong corn set a new record of 2 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan. Red sorghum was slightly more expensive by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and green beans were average.

### Cotton Yarn Distribution Method: Yarn Control Committee Changes Implementation; Prices to Be Self-Reported by Applicants

[Our Correspondent] China Textile Construction Company received a notice from the Yarn Control Committee yesterday stating that, starting today (the 25th), the prices of distributed yarn will be temporarily self-reported by the applicant users, and the Textile Construction Company will approve them with reference to market conditions. The quota for each buyer will still be handled according to the original amount.

The total number of cotton yarn sold yesterday, including the Yarn Control Committee and the Textile Construction Company, reached 4,448 bales, equivalent to 5,462 bales of 20-count yarn, recovering a total of 300 billion yuan in cash. Of the yarns sold, 2,850 bales were sold by the Textile Construction Company at posted prices, equivalent to 2,850 bales of 20-count yarn, with 655 application forms. A total of 1,598 bales were sold by the Textile Construction Company on behalf of the Yarn Control Committee, equivalent to 2,081 bales of 20-count yarn, with 288 application forms.

The opening prices for each count of yarn were: 12-count Nikko 26 million yuan, 8-count Guang 33.5 million yuan, 10-count Lima Deputy Blue Phoenix 36 million yuan, 20-count Hongfeng 58 million yuan to Dafang 62.1 million yuan. 31-count Xiantao 82.5 million yuan, 31-count Twisted Xiantao 86.5 million yuan, 40-count Lam Fung 85 million yuan, 40-count K Caiqiu 90 million yuan, 42-count Double-Strand Shuiyue 92 million yuan, 60-count Nikko 165 million yuan.

Market Chaos

Also reported: The Textile Construction Company's sale of distributed yarn yesterday caused a stalemate due to pricing issues. The cotton yarn market yesterday was extremely chaotic. The Economic Section of the Police Bureau increased the number of economic police officers to closely monitor the market. The Yarn Control Committee also sold 16 types of cotton yarn in the market, but the shouting prices were still extremely chaotic. The price of 42-count yarn was shouted up to a high of 120 million yuan, while the price of 21-count yarn was reduced to more than 70 million yuan.

Yarn Prices Soar

The cotton yarn market situation yesterday was due to soaring raw cotton prices and scarce factory supply. Although the Textile Construction Company repeatedly posted prices, the public was strongly bullish, and various groups absorbed the yarn as soon as it was sold. Only the sound of buying was heard in the market, and there were very few sellers. With too little congee and too many monks, the market once again frantically soared upwards.

The initial opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped by 19 million yuan, breaking through the 100 million yuan mark to 108 million yuan. Subsequently, short squeezes occurred, and floor traders took the opportunity to trade, creating a new record high of 112 million yuan. Near the close, many floating profits were sold, and the price fell slightly, closing at 105 million yuan, a huge increase of 16 million yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, the prices of various counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose sharply, setting new records again.

Cotton Cloth Gallops

The cotton cloth market situation was initially stable under the supervision of the authorities, and there was no significant activity between buyers and sellers. Very little trading was done in the market. It was then heard that northern groups were absorbing outside the market, and Changjiang groups were also making inroads. Furthermore, the fine cloth and serge supplied by the Textile Construction Company on alternating days were distributed by number. With raw cotton stocks depleted and prices high, floating funds from outside ports gathered in Shanghai, dyeing factories imported more and exported less, and the local cloth produced by the local factories in the four rural districts had excellent outlets. There were also entrants from outside the industry, creating a situation of galloping prices. As a result, the prices of 12-pound fine cloth of various brands jumped by more than 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, serge, Zhiguan cloth, and Shilin cloth also set new highs.

### Distribution of Cotton Yarn to Replicating Industries to Adopt Quotation and Approval Method

[Our Correspondent] Yesterday, the market price of yarn and cloth continued to rise sharply. A responsible person from the Yarn Control Committee recently stated that the prices of various commodities have been rising recently, and the price of yarn and cloth has risen more sharply this time because it has been suppressed too much in the past few days. In order to stabilize the rising trend, the committee has, in addition to publicly announcing the temporary suspension of cotton yarn transportation to the south, also urged the Textile Construction Company to continuously sell cotton yarn in the cotton yarn market every day. However, in the past, the Textile Construction Company opened sales of cotton yarn to the cotton yarn replicating industry every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, all based on negotiated prices. This negotiated price is still the method set by the former Textile Control Committee. Currently, the negotiated price for each bale of 20-count yarn is 45.7 million yuan, while the market price for each bale is 67.8 million yuan, a difference of more than 20 million yuan. The cost of production has also exceeded the negotiated price significantly. However, the cloth woven by the replicating industry using cotton yarn distributed at the negotiated price is still sold at the market price. Therefore, yarn production factories suffer losses that do not cover costs, and in fact, it has not been possible to achieve the effect of stabilizing yarn and cloth prices. After careful consideration by the committee and approval by Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, it has been decided that, starting from the 25th of this month, the distribution of cotton yarn to the replicating industry will adopt the quotation and approval method. The Textile Construction Company will still distribute as much as possible according to the original amount.

### Cotton Textile Exports Can Apply for Exchange of Raw Materials

[Our Correspondent] The central task of the Export Control Committee this year has been determined to be the promotion of exports and the acquisition of foreign exchange. To this end, the committee has convened representatives from relevant industries to discuss implementation methods. Discussions have been held with representatives of the cotton textile industry on the previous two days, as the industry has the greatest hope for exports, especially to various parts of Southeast Asia. Cotton textile industry insiders, because the Export Control Committee has established a method for exchanging raw materials for exported products, and the China Trust Bureau also has a method for exchanging yarn for exported products, have raised the question of whether they can still exchange yarn if there is a surplus of raw materials exchanged for exported products. After discussion, it was considered that they can apply separately.

### Silk Rises Again

The artificial silk market rose sharply again yesterday. The opening price of 120-count Asahi Brand glossy silk in the morning was raised to 55 million yuan, but there were very few transactions due to the high price. The closing price at noon retreated to 48 million yuan. In the afternoon, it once fell to 45 million yuan, but finally rose to a selling price of 49 million yuan.

Although factories have distributed some, the quantity is very small, so the market price has not been suppressed. Yesterday's market price for Grade C silk was 60 million yuan, high grade others 55 million yuan, and ordinary dry grade others 22 million yuan, with some trading done. The market situation remained stable in the afternoon, with asking prices similar to the morning.

The silk goods market rose sharply yesterday. Due to the soaring raw materials and the sharp increase in costs, factory prices were raised one after another. Huaqiang silk bed sheets rose the most to 63 million yuan, and the closing price fell to 62 million yuan for immediate delivery. Dachang checkered crepe rose the most to 280,000 yuan, and the closing price was 275,000 yuan. The prices of other goods also increased by 5% to 8%.

### Tea Market Deserted

The tea market still remained deserted as holders clung to their goods, pushing asking prices higher, and showing a latent bullish trend. Transactions, however, were still sparse. The reason seems to be that exporters found the asking prices too high and stopped buying. As for domestic varieties, local and outside buyers were interested, but the scarcity of supply prevented them from buying at will. Only small quantities were traded.

### Large Purchase of Chinese Stocks, Many Small Stocks Hitting Limit Up

Yesterday, the buying of Chinese stocks was strong. Non-industry floating capital returned, and off-market stimulus increased, with new prices emerging one after another. As the yarn market was closed, small stocks became even more profitable. More than ten stocks, including Jinglun National Goods, Xinguang, and Jingfu, all hit their limit up.

Although market sentiment was good in the early morning, it was slightly dampened by the news of crackdowns on off-market trading. Jinglun's new shares were listed and eagerly bought by both industry insiders and outsiders, immediately rising to the limit. Yongsha spot and forward were both listed at a price of 1,000 yuan. Stocks such as No. 9 were sold for immediate delivery, and stocks such as No. 178 were sold for forward delivery, retreating to low prices of 985 yuan and 983 yuan. Spot and forward were inverted. Stocks such as No. 197 were eagerly bought for immediate delivery, and No. 78 was bought for forward delivery. The off-market interest rate fell to 0.21 yuan and 0.255 yuan, rising to 1,045 yuan and 1,040 yuan. Mr. Gong decisively took short positions, and off-market trading fell first. No. 178 and others sold for immediate delivery while prices were high, and No. 8 returned for delivery, retreating to 1,025 yuan and 1,015 yuan. However, Hong Kong Electric plummeted, and the black market surge arose, stirring up market sentiment again. Small stocks also rose across the board, performing exceptionally well. No. 231 and others went long for immediate delivery, and No. 12 went long for forward delivery, rising to new high prices of 1,065 yuan and 1,070 yuan. Banks such as No. 220 sold forward deliveries while prices were high, and also sold some small stocks. Yongsha closed in the morning at 1,060 yuan and 1,065 yuan. Jinglun, Zhabei, Zhongfang, Hengfeng, and Yongye all reached their limit up. After Xinguang was suspended, it rebounded slightly. Compared with the previous close, Yongsha, Meiya, Xinhe, and Yonggong rose by half, and Xinguang rose by the limit, rebounding. In addition to Zhabei, Jinglun, Zhongfang, Tongyi, Yongye, and Hengfeng rising to the limit, the remaining stocks rose by 10% to just under 20%. Forward delivery stocks rose by half for Yongsha, Xinhe, and Meiya, and the remaining stocks rose by slightly more than 10%.

In the after-market, forward deliveries were suspended as usual. Yongsha opened and rose to 1,070 yuan immediately. No. 218 and No. 103 advanced to 1,085 yuan. Nos. 8 and 9 sold, and a large trader named Zheng sold off-market, immediately falling slightly to 1,030 yuan. Nos. 188 and others took advantage of the low prices to buy in. However, due to the poor performance of the national banks, prices rose and mostly plateaued, rebounding to 1,060 yuan. Nos. 76 and others sold, falling to 1,015 yuan. Nos. 202 and others bought forcefully, and the closing price rose to 1,040 yuan. Jinglun National Goods and Lian'an still reached their limit up. Datong, Xinguang, Zhongfa, Zhabei, Jingfu, Yongye, and Huaqi were suspended and rebounded. Compared with the morning close, National Goods, Lian'an, Jinglun, and Yongye reached their limit up. Zhabei, Xinguang, Jingfu, Zhongfa, Huaqi, Xinrong, Rongchang, and Datong were suspended and rebounded. There were varying degrees of gains and losses, and the remaining stocks fell slightly. Various unlisted stocks in the off-market market were generally prosperous, rising by slightly more than 10%.

Tongyi Yarn Factory will begin issuing dividends on March 1st. The market opened for ex-dividend trading before that date.

### Public Debt Rises, Foreign Stocks Surge Again

Government bonds experienced significant gains yesterday. Type C Consolidated Bonds opened at 80,000 yuan in the morning, initially dropping from 89,000 to 82,000 yuan before rebounding to 92,000 yuan near closing, followed by a slight retreat. Compared to the previous closing, Types A, B, D, and E each rose by 5,000 yuan, while Type C surged by 9,000 yuan. Trading volume reached approximately 3 million yuan.

Foreign stocks continued their dramatic rise yesterday, fueled by the black market. Hong Kong Electric shares saw a sharp contraction in supply, leading to a surge in buying interest. Foreign firms, Cantonese merchants, and securities houses competed fiercely for purchases. Ewo Cotton Mills shares opened at 1.13 million yuan and soared to a new high of 1.25 million yuan before slightly retreating in the afternoon, still holding above the 1.2 million yuan mark. Trading in miscellaneous stocks was limited. Compared to the previous closing, Ewo Cotton Mills, British American Tobacco, Paper, and Telephone shares each rose by fifteen percent, with other stocks also experiencing gains of ten percent.

### Industrial Loan Review Results Submitted for Approval by the Four Banks Joint Office

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The industrial loan review committee of the Four Banks Joint Office held a meeting here on the 23rd. It was decided to form three sub-committees to conduct specialized reviews, focusing on loan interest rates, deposits, and other aspects. These sub-committees held separate meetings yesterday to further discuss and study the issues, and conclusions have now been reached. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, the results were resubmitted to the industrial loan review committee for further review. The conclusions reached have been taken to Nanjing by Mr. Diao Peiran, Deputy Director of the Loan Committee of the Four Banks Joint Office. They will be combined with the results of the agricultural loan sub-committee and submitted to the Four Banks Board of Directors for approval next Thursday, and then presented to the Chairman for final approval. It is understood that loans will be available for export goods, essential goods for people's livelihood, transportation, public utilities, industrial and mining enterprises, and the production and transportation of salt. These loans will be provided through methods such as purchasing, placing orders, contract manufacturing, and collateralization. Discounting is expected to remain limited as a principle. Interest rates, except for a small portion that will maintain low rates, will largely be calculated based on market rates. The loan terms will also be shortened as much as possible.

### Cotton Mills Face Cotton Shortage, Remedial Measures Agreed Upon

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Cotton Spinning Association of Six Districts held its 103rd executive board meeting yesterday at noon. After discussion, it was agreed that the current rising cotton prices, coupled with a lack of cotton reserves in some mills making it difficult to provide assistance, was a cause for great concern. It was decided to send Wang Qiyu, Liu Jingji, Wang Zhuyi, and others to visit Chairman Yuan of the Cotton Control Commission to request guidance. The meeting resulted in the agreement of the following four measures: (1) The association will automatically report the actual cotton inventory of each mill and promptly compile the data. (2) If a cotton mill genuinely lacks cotton and urgently needs assistance, the Cotton Control Commission, after verifying the situation, may adopt a contract spinning approach to provide raw cotton in advance, ensuring that mills do not have to suspend production. (3) The association will immediately notify its member mills to refrain from independently purchasing cotton in Shanghai, to uphold the government's cotton purchasing regulations. (4) The Cotton Control Commission's Shanghai warehouse already has 300,000 to 400,000 dan of raw cotton, with a large quantity continuing to arrive, so there is no need to worry about shortages.

### Sugar Group Meeting Decides that the Ninth Period Taiwan Sugar Allocation Price Will No Longer Be Adjusted with Exchange Rate Fluctuations

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Sugar Group of the Municipal Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting yesterday and resolved that the winter relief donation attached to the Taiwan Sugar Company's sugar allocation, originally scheduled to end at the end of February of this year, will now be extended to April 15th. Furthermore, to expand the city's security funding, 60,000 yuan per dan will be collected from the Taiwan Sugar Company's ninth allocation onward.

Starting with the Taiwan Sugar Company's ninth sugar allocation, the allocation price will be readjusted, but future adjustments will not be based on fluctuations in the Taiwan dollar exchange rate. The profit margin for wholesalers will also be increased from 16 percent to 20 percent starting with the ninth sugar allocation. The readjusted prices for the ninth sugar allocation are as follows:

### Allocation Price Increased by 60%

Another report: Yesterday, the sugar market was affected by the continuous depreciation of the Taiwan dollar, reaching 125 yuan. Therefore, the Taiwan Sugar Company also significantly adjusted the allocation price today, increasing it by approximately 40 to 60 percent. Adding other educational funds and security donations of 130,000 yuan, the price of red, white, and refined sugar all exceeded 2 million yuan. Rock sugar saw the largest increase, reaching 4.13 million yuan including additional funds. The highest grade of superfine white sugar was 2.78 million yuan, and the lowest grade of Taiwan refined sugar was 2.23 million yuan. The association's trading floor thus became even more bullish. Spot 24 coarse white sugar was priced at 4 million to 4.05 million yuan, and four-and-a-half cart white sugar was priced at 4.1 million to 4.15 million yuan. 20 medium sand white sugar was priced at 3.245 million to 3.3 million yuan.

Local sugar also followed suit. Shantou refined sugar opened at 2.53 million yuan, Xinghua white sugar at 3.63 million to 3.68 million yuan, Xinghua red sugar at 2.53 million yuan, Diao refined sugar at 2.48 million yuan, ordinary Hainan red sugar at 2.35 million yuan, and high-quality Hainan red sugar at 2.45 million yuan. Peruvian granulated sugar was priced at 3.7 million yuan. Warehouse receipt trading saw August futures rise by more than 100,000 yuan. However, September futures, due to the increased allocation price, saw initial tightness followed by softening, declining by 40,000 yuan.

### Financial Control Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Investigate the Financial Status of Insurance Companies

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Financial Control Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate the use of funds by insurance companies. To understand the use of funds in the insurance industry and facilitate audits, the Ministry of Finance has formulated forms in accordance with the wartime insurance industry management regulations. The Shanghai Financial Control Bureau has ordered the industry association to comply and submit the completed forms within three days, and has dispatched personnel to conduct on-site investigations at various companies. In addition, the black market for gold banknotes has recently become rampant again, significantly impacting commodity prices. The Financial Control Bureau has decided to dispatch personnel to conduct secret investigations in conjunction with the Municipal Police Bureau, and those found to be involved will be severely punished.

### Paper Prices Surge Sharply

The paper market is experiencing extreme scarcity of both available stock and incoming supplies. Further exacerbated by the easing of credit, various parties are actively seeking to procure paper, including those outside the industry, leading to continuous price increases. Yesterday, the surge was particularly pronounced. American white newsprint was selling for 3 million yuan upon leaving customs, soaring as high as 3.25 million yuan. Folio white newsprint was priced at 3.05 million yuan, representing a significant increase of 350,000 yuan each compared to the previous day. Colored white typing paper was priced at 4 million yuan outside customs, also reaching 4.5 million yuan for white and 4.2 million yuan for colored, soaring by 600,000 to 400,000 yuan. In addition, tracing paper, kraft paper, glassine paper, and other paper types also saw increases of 10 to 20 percent.

Publishing World

### Man and Medicine

—Di Shan

Written by H.E. Sigerist, Translated by Qian Ji, Published by Commercial Press "This is a general treatise on medicine written using historical narrative. Each chapter is an interesting historical story." - Hu Shi's Preface

The author, H.E. Sigerist, is Swiss. He has lived in various countries and studied their history in detail. He is a person with an international perspective and broad vision. His early education was mostly obtained in France. His medical studies were conducted at the University of Zurich in his home country. He also studied at Johns Hopkins University for a period, thus establishing contact with British academic life. He later held the most important chair of medical history in all of Germany at the University of Leipzig. His book "Man and Medicine" was written in Leipzig. This book was originally a lecture given by the author to new medical students at the University of Leipzig each year, but the value and function of this book are not limited to medical students. Translations have been published in various countries around the world and are widely welcomed by readers.

The translation and publication of the Chinese version went through some twists and turns. In 1933, Gu Lin, acting president of Peking Union Medical College, discussed with Mr. Hu Shi the idea of finding someone to translate Dr. Sigerist's "Man and Medicine." Mr. Hu Shi originally hoped that the Foundation Compilation and Translation Committee could bear the translation costs. However, the committee did not have the resources at that time, so President Gu Lin personally bore the translation costs. Coincidentally, Gu Qianji, who studied agronomy, was willing to translate it, so the Chinese translation of this world-renowned masterpiece was able to be published.

The book is divided into seven parts, including knowledge of various aspects of man and medicine and medical history. The author's original manuscript was a lecture, so the language is easy to understand and fascinating. The translation is also clean and clear, making it easy to read.

The first chapter talks about man. He said, "The thoughts and actions of doctors always focus on man. All their efforts are to treat human diseases and find ways to prevent humans from getting sick." Regarding doctors, he said, "It is not enough for doctors to observe humans only from the perspective of natural science. Doctors should also study the unique position of man in the world and recognize him as an intelligent being. He must study the whole man and study the sum of man's life experience." Readers can be said to be deeply attracted by his writing when they read his entire book from the starting point of Sigerist's great love.

In the first chapter, "Man," he not only told us about the structure and function of the human body, but also told us the importance of "psychology and mind." He said, "Doctors should walk side by side with humans, hoping to know that an empty shell cannot give you the ability to treat and guide patients. This ability comes from a deep knowledge of man and life."

The second chapter talks about "The Patient." Sigerist traces the position of patients in cultural development from ancient times. He pointed out that the most thorough and decisive change in the status of patients was influenced by Christianity. This influence of liberating human suffering is really great. Christianity removed the stigma of sin from patients and made them free. From this article, we can clearly understand the historical evolution of the status of patients and know the position of patients in modern society.

Chapters three, four, five, and ten, including "The Symbol of Medicine," "Disease," and "Causes of Disease," can be said to be the most essential narratives in the book. The most important thing about the author is to point out the relationship between cultural development and historical evolution, and always respect the progress of man and medicine. How humans overcame all kinds of disease invasions, how humans struggled to protect human safety, and how humans used wisdom to invent all new treatments for diseases.

In the sixth chapter, "Treatment," Sigerist repeatedly pointed out all the situations, procedures, and methods that should be paid attention to in treatment. The last chapter talks about "Doctors." He tells us that the actions of doctors are not free. Doctors have their responsibilities, and this responsibility puts doctors under ordinary moral laws. Sigerist also quoted Paracelsus's words: "The origin of medicine is love," so he said: "Enthusiasm for helping people, love for mankind, and natural sacrifice are all contained in all medical ideals."

The biggest feature of this book is that it makes us understand the historical and cultural background of every new theory or new technology everywhere. It uses general culture as a canvas on which to draw a panoramic view of medicine. Mr. Hu Shi said well in his preface: "So we can say that this is a general treatise on medicine written using historical narrative. Each chapter is a narrative of history, a story, a very interesting historical story."

The translation was proofread and prefaced by Mr. Hu Shi. It was first published in 1935. It was not until last year that Commercial Press republished it in the "New Middle School Library," from which we can imagine that this book has not yet attracted the attention of many readers in our country. The author dares to introduce it, so that this great work becomes the reading of every intellectual, and further helps the vast illiterate population in our country who do not have new medical knowledge.

### Random Talks on Reading Interests

— Mang

(Written by Du Zuozhou, etc., printed by China Cultural Service Society)

Reading is something that makes many readers feel pain. Although there are good reading methods and a suitable reading environment, it still makes people feel pain. Since reading is considered a painful thing, of course it will not tell people to read well. Even if they are forced to read, it will still have no effect. What is the reason for this? The biggest key is whether there is an interest in reading.

Reading is originally a happy thing in life. Readers can obtain truth and justice from books and learn about all the secrets of life. Therefore, many people who are interested in reading think about reading all the time. They are not happy without reading. Why do we not like reading instead? It is because we are not interested in reading. How can we make ourselves interested in reading? It seems to be a difficult problem, but it is not difficult to implement. Here is a book that will introduce you to this topic. The title of the book is "Random Talks on Reading Interests." It will show you how to cultivate your interest in reading.

"Random Talks on Reading Interests" is a small booklet of only eighty pages, containing more than twenty articles. The content is entirely about cultivating reading interests, reading methods, attitudes, etc. Each article is written by one or two people. They expressed their reading experience and reading methods, which are obviously of great help to readers. It seems to have value in introducing.

The first article is "On the Way of Learning." In just a few thousand words, it analyzes the methods and attitudes of learning clearly. It provides particularly correct guidance for people who generally read books by rote, read books by rote, and learn nothing for practical use. It has unique insights on the methods of learning, and it believes that the spirit of so-called "geniuses" who do not know how to work hard and give up on themselves is undesirable. It wants us to work harder!

For example, in the article "How to Cultivate Reading Interest," the author discusses it in detail and lists various points, such as: reading should be voluntary; understand the purpose of reading; reading should have a spirit of hard work and self-encouragement; reading should be both precise and broad; and other points are common problems for us readers. There are other detailed instructions on how to correct it.

For example, in "About Reading," the purpose of our reading, what books to read, and how to read are all explained and instructed. It also points out our problem of only relying on memory, not thinking, and not integrating reading. The current examination system in schools makes most students develop such habits. They only read books and listen to lectures in class, relying entirely on memory to cope with exams. The knowledge gained by rote memorization is thrown away after the exam. This is such a serious problem!

Other articles also have unique features. To avoid trouble, I will not list them one by one. Finally, several people wrote about the books they like to read and stated the reasons why they like to read them. For example, Zhou Yutong likes to read "New Learning and Pseudo-Classics Examination." Taking this book as a pivot, he grasped the dynamics of thousands of years of Chinese culture. For example, Hu Shanyuan likes to read "Brave Young Men" because there is a motto in it: "As long as you do things upright, don't ask about success or failure, profit or loss." Of course, there are more than just these two articles, and the others are omitted.

In short, this book is a very good guide in any case. It is of great benefit to people who are not interested in reading, even people who are interested in reading but have not yet succeeded. It not only gives instructions on reading methods and interest cultivation, but also involves what books should be read, the realm of reading, etc. It is indeed a beacon of guidance for readers! Therefore, people who have read this book should fulfill a responsibility, which is to introduce this book to those who are not interested in reading, so that they can get happiness from reading.

Do you want to make you interested in reading? Then, I advise you to read this book.

### [For the Next Generation]

— Yi Xiu

Written by Mu Shaoliang, Published by Commercial Press, Price 2.50 yuan, 104 pages

Revitalizing national morality is indeed an extremely urgent task today. Before the war, we had the May Fourth New Culture Movement, the Old Morality Restoration Movement, and the New Life Movement. Today, we still need a movement to revitalize national morality. Among the targets of this movement, the most important are the young people whose blood is still uncertain. The so-called "youth are the masters of the country" and "youth are the pillars of the nation," if this generation of young people has morality, cultivation, public morality, a sense of right and wrong, and a sense of justice, then this generation of country has hope. In particular, most young people are pure, frank, and easily infected, so it is easier to accept and implement new moral concepts and moral awareness, and it is also particularly important. Therefore, for young people, I feel that this matter is not a "revitalization" at all, because bad young people have always been a very small minority.

This book is written in the style of letters. The table of contents includes "First Letter: Emerging from the Old" (on civic virtue), "Second Letter: Has Heaven Ever Distinguished Good and Evil?" (on good and evil and karma), "Third Letter: The Supreme Man Living in Isolation" (on the individual and society); "Fourth Letter: Be an Anonymous Hero" (on active and passive); "Fifth Letter: Starting from the Final Victory" (on loyalty and filial piety); "Sixth Letter: A Happy Family" (admonishing father and mother); "Seventh Letter: Virtues That Violate Human Nature" (on diligence and thrift); "Eighth Letter: Even if it's Zhuge Liang" (on fame and fortune), "Ninth Letter: Mark Twain and Cao Cao" (on the attitude of being a person), "Tenth Letter: How Should We Deal with People" (on dealing with the world and making friends); "Eleventh Letter: The Candle Burns to Ashes and Tears Dry" (on the meaning of work); "Twelfth Letter: Self-Improvement Without Ceasing" (on the attitude of work)

Looking at the table of contents above, I feel that the author has taken ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, as topics. I don't know how he will deal with these mixed and chaotic things under a consistent moral view. This kind of writing is obviously laborious and unrewarding; if you are not careful, you may write a new-style "Taishang Ganying Pian." However, the author of this book, Mr. Mu Shaoliang, not only has profound and unique insights and thoughts, but also has a lively and humorous writing style; thoughts are enough to control the writing style, and the writing style can fully render thoughts. After reading this thin book of about seventy or eighty thousand words, I only feel relaxed and happy, but also full of strength. It is definitely not as headache-inducing as the general books of persuasion and correction, and even if you reluctantly finish reading it, it is tasteless. In the twelve letters, the author tells various moral issues in a gentle and earnest manner, in a simple and profound way, and the aftertaste is extremely meaningful. What is even more gratifying is that the content focuses on fun and is not glib, talking about principles and popularizing them, without rigid dogmas and without shocking high-level arguments. Every word and every word starts from practical things, which is both easy to understand and practical. There is absolutely no unrealistic empty talk. It is indeed a good work worth recommending!

The author has given a new interpretation to some of the old Chinese morality (such as the four dimensions and eight virtues, etc.), discarding the unreasonable, outdated, conservative and decadent parts, and at the same time injecting some new and progressive social morality. The processing is very appropriate. In the whole book, in addition to expounding his consistent theory, you can also find many of the author's insightful original ideas.

The biggest feature of this book is that it fits the current reality and provides kind and interesting guidance to young people. It is based on reality, and critiques and criticizes reality. It does not extravagantly talk about how beautiful the future will be and what kind of perfect moral cultivation needs to be established in that future. He does not sing high-profile (but not out of date), and always grasps reality, which is extremely important. As for the form of writing letters, it is also worth learning for young people; the author narrates in a fascinating, organized, tactful and circuitous way, using a beautiful and fluent writing style, which makes the readers very happy.

It is easy to write this kind of book, but it is difficult to write it well. At the same time, everyone has different opinions, and criticism is extremely difficult, but this book has no shortcomings in this regard. If there are any shortcomings in this book, then it seems that the scope is not large enough and the aspects are not broad enough (for example, this book does not mention the issue of love, how important this issue is to young people!). According to the author's speculation, the author can continue to write the thirteenth and fourteenth letters in a series, and gradually put forward and discuss guidance on issues such as love, which will be of greater benefit to young people.

In today's lack of good books on moral cultivation, I would like to recommend this book to young people across the country.

### George Bernard Shaw Travels to Soviet Russia

It is reported that Xiao Min is now ninety-two years old and no longer makes long trips. This is a photo taken at the Berlin train station on his way to the Soviet Union at the age of seventy-five. Shaw smiled and told reporters, "Every time I take a photo, I have to pay me two shillings."

### The Last Critical Moment for Americans in China

— Lin Jing

Original by Freda Utley, Translated by Hua Jun Gang

Published by Minzhi Publishing House, Distributed by Shanghai Fuzhou Road Independent Publishing House

In the very first chapter, the author states, "I want to write a book about China, and I want to write it without any bias. Bias is inevitable, but I do have some bias towards communism and democracy." From this statement, we already know that this author wants to say a few fair words for China's advocates of the People's Livelihood Principle.

In the conclusion, she quotes Hitler: "The bigger the lie, the more people believe it. People love lies. But if one ends up deceiving oneself, that is very dangerous. For many years, magazines have been filled with articles by propagandists. Although what they wrote was completely false and lying, it was still loved by the people. Magazines only care about sales, and they don't care about the truth." This shows how much she hates those who distort the truth.

China and the Chinese People

She believes that "to criticize Chinese politics, one must first understand its historical background and actual situation. China's current problem is how to seek unification and strength without abandoning the path of democracy, how to complete reforms that require one or two hundred years within one or two decades, and without using terror and violence. In China, there remains a kind of gentle, old-century morality. The Chinese have a strong sense of individual dignity and freedom. Any foreigner who comes to China will find the social democracy between people there to be different. People of completely different classes, rich, poor, officials, merchants, scholars, workers, or farmers, they can all talk freely, and even the lowest profession will not feel like slaves. Although they are poor, they do their own thing and never lose their self-esteem. The Chinese, at least in spirit, are very free. The Chinese need genuine assistance and practical, constructive advice, but they do not need condescending lessons. We must recognize that today's China is weak due to the deep damage suffered during the eight-year war of resistance and the wanton destruction by the communists. If the United States clearly states its support for China, this will be of great help to China. If China, with our help, becomes a democratic power, it will be of great benefit to the free world."

Fighting Alone for Democracy

Her conclusions are:

(1) China must be supported and no longer be allowed to independently hold this frontline of world strategy. If the United States does not want China to be swallowed by the Communist Party, it must fully support it so that it no longer fights alone for democratic countries.

(2) Economically, we must understand that today's US aid to China, although much larger than the aid before the war, is still not enough given the vastness of its territory, the size of its population, and the heavy tasks of post-war reconstruction and reform. US aid must truly be effective for the situation to improve. The money needed to restore China's productive forces is proportionally much smaller than that needed in Europe. In total, about twenty to thirty billion US dollars of aid would be sufficient.

"The United States must not be deceived and must abandon its ambivalent and contradictory policies and adopt a firm, far-sighted, and statesmanlike policy to use American power and influence.

"The Americans in China are now at a critical moment. This critical moment may last for a considerable period, but in any case, the later it gets, the worse the situation will be. Now, we must immediately re-equip the Chinese government's army and support patriotic Chinese people to contain those foreign-flattering elements who want to drag China into the Soviet sphere. Now is the best time for all of this. History, of course, may have many twists and turns. I am not a prophet and cannot point out which day or which is truly the critical moment. But I feel without a doubt that the fate of China and our fate will be determined in the near future."

The author is a Far East expert, a famous reporter. "Japan's Impasse" was her previous book, and during the Japanese invasion, she called on the United States to aid China. Now she is calling for aid to China again to prevent it from being invaded again.

### Reading [Biography of Shaw]

— Bu Shu

Written by Hesketh Pearson, Translated by Huang Jia De

"He is a standard resident of the earth... once called the Voltaire of the twentieth century, but will undoubtedly become the Voltaire of the twenty-first and twenty-second centuries as well."

Last August 26th was Shaw's 90th birthday, and newspapers and magazines around the world published commemorative articles. I believe that the commentary in Soviet E. Yarmolov's "Mischief in Literature" is the most pertinent and insightful. (This article was later translated by Mr. He Jia Huai and published in the "Sunday Literary" section of the Ta Kung Pao on November 23rd of this year.) Recently, after reading Hesketh Pearson's "Biography of Shaw," I naturally have a deeper understanding of Shaw's love of "jokes," but I still agree with E. Yarmolov's words: "Shaw is a standard resident of the earth."

Hesketh Pearson was a close friend of Shaw and worked with Shaw in journalism, but more often, he appeared as a "sexual psychologist." Before Hesketh Pearson wrote "Biography of Shaw," Shaw repeatedly expressed his opposition, but eventually provided materials and opinions. After Hesketh Pearson's death, Shaw himself proofread the entire manuscript. He said that he did not agree with Hesketh Pearson's opinions, but also believed that Hesketh Pearson had his own views. If this book is regarded as a chapter in the biography of Shaw, "Shaw's Opinions on Gender Issues" or "Shaw's Sexual History," he agrees with Hesketh Pearson's writing.

What the entire "Biography of Shaw" highlights may not be the real Shaw, but the Shaw in Hesketh Pearson's eyes, but if we admit that Hesketh Pearson has keen insight and uncompromising vision, then looking out from Hesketh Pearson's perspective, we can see some aspects of Shaw. These embarrassing aspects cannot be seen in G.K. Chesterton's "A Critical Study of Shaw" and S.C. San Gupta's "The Art of Bernard Shaw." Hesketh Pearson has written many biographies, and even a biography of Shakespeare. His views are inevitably biased, but it cannot be said that he has no insight. The same is true of his writing of "Biography of Shaw." In this biography, he ignored what most people value and valued what most people ignore, such as the chapters "Shaw's Women" and "Shaw's Views on Gender," which can be said to have not been explored by anyone before Hesketh Pearson, so these chapters can also be said to be the most surprising in the entire book.

But this is not to say that apart from gender issues, this biography is not worth reading. The fact is that among the authors of Shaw's biographies, Hesketh Pearson is perhaps the most critical. In Chapter 10, "Shaw's Socialism," Hesketh Pearson has extremely profound criticism of Shaw's thought and spirit. He denies that Shaw is a philosopher because he does not have his own system of thought; he also criticizes Shaw's wavering stance during the First European War, saying that he sometimes wanted to form an alliance with Romain Rolland and others, standing on the position of a "world citizen" to oppose the war, and at other times he became a thorough nationalist. In Chapter 18, "Technique," and Chapter 19, "Greater Than Shakespeare?" he has subtle criticisms of Shaw's playwriting techniques and also denies his style of lacking momentum. These criticisms are all insightful and are not in the tone of a general peacemaker. This is why Hesketh Pearson was always able to be Shaw's critical friend.

Because Shaw worked with Hesketh Pearson for a considerable period of time when he was young, and Shaw's writing career and Hesketh Pearson's magazine career were often intertwined, Hesketh Pearson is more familiar with Shaw's struggles in his youth. From Chapter 2, "Ireland in the 1860s," to Chapter 8, "The Destitute Years in London," all that is written is Shaw's struggle, but everywhere there is Hesketh Pearson's commentary and annotation, and his views are by no means as vulgar as those of general biographers.

What is particularly valuable is that in the preface to "Biography of Shaw," there are several letters from Shaw to Hesketh Pearson, talking about his own past life, which are extremely important historical materials in the literary world. The final "Postscript" is Shaw's opinion on this biography after proofreading the entire text, and the main point is to discuss Hesketh Pearson's personality and works, so it can also be read as "Shaw's Essay on Hesketh Pearson." Shaw's "Postscript" is written quite wittily, and its humor is no less than that of the frank confession attached to Chapter 17, "Shaw's Views on Gender."

Shaw is witty and frank, and his only strength is that he is willing to tell the truth to anyone, but his truth is often taken as a joke. So in the end, he regarded himself as "the world's greatest joke merchant." He said that the objects of his "jokes" are all the ordinary things that people ignore, and that because he said them in a more frank way, they are considered ridiculous. In replying to Tolstoy's letter责备 him for loving to laugh, he once said the following:

"Why should humor and laughter be subject to prohibited punishment? Supposing that this world is in fact just a joke by God, then are you going to give up the effort to turn it from a bad joke into a good joke?"

Therefore, even when he admits that he is a joke merchant, he is not a person who "jokes for the sake of joking." He is a great man who wants to turn bad jokes into good jokes, and "humor" is just his tool or means. He is not as leisurely as our joke artisans.

Shaw is a socialist, a Fabian, a pacifist, a vegetarian, an abstainer... but in fact, he is also a great contradiction: he supports war and opposes war; supports democracy and opposes parliament; supports evolution and opposes Darwin; supports nationalism and opposes patriotism; supports the chastity and restraint of men and women and opposes censorship. In his plays and novels, too, two Shaws are revealed:

"These Shaws cannot agree on how to win a 'good, comfortable life.' One of them has very clearly pointed out in his works: in order for people to live rationally, it is necessary to transform the social environment first. This Shaw wrote some 'unpleasant' plays. But the other Shaw wants us to first transform ourselves if we want to make life meaningful and valuable; this Shaw loves to write plays about abnormal physiology. This 'unpleasant' Shaw is a realist and a socialist. The Shaw who loves to write plays about abnormal physiology is an idealist. This 'unpleasant' Shaw is a destroyer of idols; but the other abnormal physiologist is a 'believer in the Life Force.'" (E. Yarmolov)

By dissecting Shaw in this way—one side being a realist and the other being an idealist; one side being a fighter and the other being a compromiser—we may be able to get closer to his soul. Everyone has their inner struggles, and these struggles do not detract from his greatness, because he is a man, not a god. As a man, Shaw is blameless; and Hesketh Pearson's "Biography of Shaw" contains many records of this "man" in his struggles in modern society.

### Exploring Plum Blossoms Indoors

— He Ku

When spring just revealed a bit of news, according to people from Hangzhou, tourists on vacation had already poured in, with the goal of going to Gushan to see plum blossoms. When the plum blossoms had already begun to bloom, I could see that when I walked through the Wangping Street area on Lunar New Year's Eve. There, a large number of flower vendors were selling Nandina, wintersweet, as well as potted red and green plum blossoms, and potted pine, bamboo, and plum—the Three Friends of Winter—etc. Thus, I guessed that areas known for their plum blossoms, such as Gushan, Chaoshan, Dengwei, and Meiyuan, must at this time be competing in beauty, using cold loneliness to report the arrival of spring.

But living in Shanghai is really too difficult. There is no scenic area in the suburbs where one can explore plum blossoms. Perhaps this is the reason why the vulgar cannot tolerate the elegant. If one goes to my hometown of Dengwei, plum trees are everywhere. In the corners of fields and houses, one can see one or two trees. Once one enters the mountains and fields, the fragrance of plum blossoms is sent from the breeze everywhere. One does not have to run to Xiangxuehai to admire the plum blossoms. In fact, exploring plum blossoms does not have to be counted as an elegant affair. People have a natural tendency to move to nature, especially those who are used to mixing in the city. Who doesn't want to go out to breathe the air and change the turbid environment? It's just that the constraints of life are too great, and there is no chance to travel, so the matter of exploring plum blossoms can only be left to idlers as an elegant affair.

However, even if you don't travel, someone will break off branches of plum blossoms from the suburbs and sell them in the small vegetable market. I bought a bunch back and placed them in a vase, as if it were a plum forest. Since I can't go to Chaoshan Dengwei to explore plum blossoms, why not explore plum blossoms in the room? Moreover, the ancients have said, "Fragrance of flowers is not in quantity." Having a bottle of plum blossoms is enough for my dream to wander in Xiangxuehai. I have this optimistic spirit of "quenching thirst by looking at plum blossoms."

In the past, people spent the poor year on New Year's Eve, hearing the firecrackers and seeing the red candlelight in other people's homes, while their own houses were cold and clear. So they wrote a poem to console themselves, ending with the line: "I inserted plum blossoms and spent the new year." I cannot go to the famous scenic areas of Jiangnan to explore plum blossoms, and can only wander in my small room, admiring the plum blossoms, applying the old sentence of the ancients for comparison, and it is nothing more than "I inserted plum blossoms and explored spring."

### Visiting Mr. Feng Zikai

— Feng Ren

One rainy afternoon, Mr. Yu Sheng and I went to visit Mr. Feng Zikai. We went to Zhaoxian Temple in West Lake, turned a bay to the left, and saw a small Chinese-style house with two swinging doors opening to the road. We walked into the parlor, and Mr. Yu Sheng called out, "Mr. Feng, there are guests to see you."

"Ah, I'm washing my feet," came a cheerful and pleasant voice from inside. Soon, Mr. Feng came out without properly dressed, and after urging me to sit down, everyone started talking casually.

Naturally, we talked about Mr. Feng's paintings. He said, "My paintings are all fabricated. I look at a living tree and treat it as a painting post." This is actually creation, but Mr. Feng politely said it was "fabricated." Mr. Feng's paintings have long lived in the hearts of millions of readers, and there is no need for me to praise them. I said, "I like Mr. Feng's essays as much as his paintings!" He said politely again, "I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed. I'm very lazy, and I haven't written articles for a long time, because writing articles is more laborious. Articles need to be deep, while paintings are flat." I asked, "Does Mr. Feng still go to Zhejiang University to teach?" He smiled and said, "Selling paintings can barely make a living, and I'm too lazy to teach."

Mr. Feng asked about my hometown. I said it was in the countryside of Shaoxing. He asked which part of the countryside, and I said Gaobu. He said, "Do you know Zhang Xichen, the boss of Kaiming? He is also from the countryside of Shaoxing—Mashan." I said, "I know a little bit. Mashan is not far from my home." He told me very kindly, "Mr. Zhang has gone home. He is visiting his mother's illness. His mother is over eighty years old."

Finally, we said goodbye and came out. He insisted on seeing us off, and I stopped him, saying, "The ground is wet." When we walked out of the gate, we still saw him standing at the door of the parlor, smiling kindly and saying, "Come again when it's sunny."

Among the many visits to "celebrities," this was the most pleasant. It was like meeting a long-lost elder, a kind of warm feeling that will always remain in my heart.

### Rice Can Cure Diseases

— Guo Ping

In today's world, rice can not only satisfy hunger; it can also cure diseases. Perhaps most people can only agree with the first half of the sentence, and they will definitely not believe the second half, or at least they will be skeptical. However, in fact, rice has also become a kind of medicine today, because rice can cure hypertension.

Canadian Dr. Ashley De Valois, seeing that the British people suffered from peptic ulcers particularly during air raids in wartime, began to study the cause. As a result, he found that peptic ulcers could cause people to suffer from hypertension. Dr. De Valois then tested what kind of drugs could cure hypertension and finally found that foods with low protein and salt and high in sugar were effective, which coincided with the principle discovered by Dr. Kempner of Duke University that "rice" can cure hypertension, because rice is a food with low protein and salt. Dr. Kempner once published in newspapers that the Chinese food—rice—has indeed been able to cure hypertension for thousands of years. Perhaps someone will ask, don't the Chinese have anyone who dies of stroke or arteriosclerosis due to hypertension? Dr. De Valois then published a simple and accurate theorem: "If you have a bowl of rice or a piece of chocolate candy in your body, rather than a glass of milk or a steak, then you can avoid hypertension and increase your life." It can be seen that if you eat more meat and fatty foods, you may have the possibility of suffering from hypertension.

One of Dr. Kempner's patients was a 32-year-old woman who suffered from severe hypertension after giving birth to her tenth child. She had 250 heart contractions and 174 heart dilations. When she arrived at the doctor's office, she was almost fainting to death, and was unconscious for several hours. But she was eventually cured. After that, Dr. Kempner published an article in the "New York Medical Bulletin" saying that he believed that the only savior for this woman was to absolutely eat "rice food," such as rice, porridge, etc., followed by some sugar, fruit, and fruit juice. After two periods of this method of treatment, her blood pressure dropped from 250 heart contractions to 156. On the 52nd day, she was the same as the standard of normal people in every aspect.

Kempner proved that 130 out of 213 patients were cured by eating rice foods, and only 75 patients did not improve. Before there is a specific medicine for hypertension in the medical community, the efficacy of rice can be said to be "second to none."

Today, Americans have recognized that rice is the only hope for people with hypertension. In the near future, rice may become one of the main foods in the United States.

### Ill-Omened Person

— Wu Jiu

On the night of April 14, 1865, US President Lincoln was sitting in the box of Ford's Theater watching a play. Suddenly, John Wilkes Booth, a disgruntled actor, appeared in the shadows. He entered the president's box and shot the president in the head. The president's attendants and theater staff immediately carried the president to a small room in a house across the street to rest. At 7:22 the next morning, the president died of his injuries.

At the time of the president's death, about twenty-five people were serving by his side, and standing next to the president was the president's eldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln.

At this time, everyone already knew that the murderer was the younger brother of Edwin Booth, a famous contemporary actor.

Sixteen years later, on July 2, 1881, President Garfield walked into the waiting room of the Washington, D.C., train station, preparing to travel to New England. An uninvited guest suddenly emerged from the crowd, named Charles Guiteau. As soon as he saw the president, he pulled out a pistol and fired two fatal shots at the president.

Lincoln's son was one of the witnesses who witnessed the assassin's attack at the time.

Twenty years later, on September 6, 1901, President McKinley was a guest of honor at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Just as everyone was cheering, anarchist Leon Czolgosz suddenly fired two shots at the president, and the president died of his injuries.

And Lincoln's son was again one of the witnesses who witnessed the assassin's attack on the scene!

In all of American history, only three presidents have been assassinated and died, and there was actually such a person who witnessed the death of one president and also witnessed the assassination of the other two presidents.

After President McKinley's death, Lincoln's son gradually had a strange feeling. He regarded himself as an ill-omened person, which was not conducive to the owner of the White House. Later, although he often received invitations from the presidential palace, he always refused them. Until his own death in 1926, he never met any president.

Lincoln's son's voluntary avoidance, of course, cannot be blamed by anyone. It was really fate that made these things happen so coincidentally. And his deep belief in fate has a fourth reason.

This happened before his father was assassinated. According to Lincoln's son himself, "During the Civil War, I was studying at Harvard University. One day, it was a holiday, and I leaned against the outer wall of a train car, waiting for them to find me a berth. Unexpectedly, the train suddenly started, and my body swayed, and I almost fell under the wheels. At that time, fortunately, there was an unfamiliar passenger on the train who grabbed me with one hand and dragged me into the carriage."

You say there is nothing strange about this, is there? But, you have to know that if this person had not acted bravely and pulled him at that time, Lincoln's son would have died under the wheels long ago.

You may also say: "Passengers accidentally falling off the train is also a common thing. What you think is strange is nothing more than because the person who was in danger was the son of a president!"

No. Lincoln's son's account also has a sentence: "Later, I learned the name of the person who saved my life. His name was Edwin Booth."

Who knew that years later, the younger brother of his benefactor would be the murderer who assassinated his father!

### Uncivilized People

— Yang Shi

Contrary to most people's expectations, there is still a small part of Germany that has not been occupied by the Allied forces. This area is called Büsingen, and more than 900 German residents live there in peace and contentment. Originally, this land was located within Switzerland and was completely surrounded by Switzerland. It was considered a small city-state of the German Confederation and has been German territory since 1809. After Germany surrendered, they lost contact with their motherland, and the shrewd British, American, Soviet, and French authorities did not think of this small piece of land. So they were in a free position. Now there is a union of these nine hundred residents, and they also exchange envoys with the Swiss local authorities, conducting all commercial operations of a "country" at that time.

### Wandering Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Eleven Full of Doubts 80

Zhu Zhai stopped for a moment and then asked, "What was the name of the person who came just now?" Qi Wan had already dried the tear stains on her face, faced outwards, glanced at Zhu Zhai, and replied, "Are you asking about that Section Chief Miao Lu Chang? He flew in from the south of the new government to handle the takeover affairs. Why are you asking about him?" Zhu Zhai said, "It's nothing. I think many of the newly arrived dignitaries and figures are not easy to deal with, especially the military. Several of them don't respect northern women very much, which is something I don't approve of at all. Who introduced you to this Section Chief Miao? I think you should avoid getting close to him in the future. Such people are not well-intentioned." When Qi Wan saw that Zhu Zhai was very nervous when he spoke, she knew in her heart that his words were indeed well-intentioned, but if she thanked him for his good intentions at this time, then all her work last night would be in vain. She immediately responded coldly, "That doesn't mean everyone is a bad person! I don't agree with what you said." Zhu Zhai had never been contradicted like this before, and he felt very unhappy. He still patiently and gently advised, "My words are based on facts. Recently, Lan Fen met a Section Chief Bai from the military, who played with her and gave her a terrible disease, and then abandoned her. Lan Fen is still in the hospital recovering. Isn't this an example?" After hearing this, Qi Wan knew that what Zhu Zhai said was true, but she thought his words were too blunt, so she immediately frowned and said, "What are you saying? Do you think I'm the same as Lan Fen?" Zhu Zhai was contradicted by Qi Wan again and lowered his head. When Qi Wan saw that Zhu Zhai's face was very embarrassed, she suddenly felt unbearable and said, "I understand the reason you're saying, and I appreciate your good intentions, but my acquaintance with this Section Chief Miao is for a purpose. I can't tell you the reason for now. Thank you for going out to find me last night, and tiring yourself out all night. I feel very uneasy. Now you should go back and rest, and I need to rest too." As she spoke, she stretched out a hand from under the quilt, shook Zhu Zhai's hand, and said, "You can go now!" Zhu Zhai wanted to say a few more words, but he was stunned by her half-warm, half-cold words. Seeing that Qi Wan turned her face inwards after saying these words and pulled the red silk quilt over her head, Zhu Zhai called out twice, but when she didn't answer, he had to reluctantly leave the bedroom. Just as he reached the stairs, Little Wang Ma blocked his way and said, "Mr. Xu, where are you going! Aren't you eating here?"

### Electrical Education in the United States

— Mao Yi

"Electrical Education" is a new and effective form of education. In recent years, education authorities in our country have also advocated electrical education, but perhaps due to limited funds and materials, it has not been widespread. In the United States, the idea of bringing movies into the classroom was proposed at the beginning of this century, but most American teachers did not pay much attention to films at that time. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Education in 1936, there were only 485 sound film projectors in public schools across the United States. However, today, the number of 16mm projectors in use has ballooned to around 35,000. Three-quarters of schools in cities with populations over 100,000 have electrical education equipment, and more than half of schools in cities with populations between 30,000 and 100,000 also have this equipment.

World War II gave a tremendous boost to educational films. Workers in war industries learned new skills. People who had never fired a gun quickly learned the secrets of anti-aircraft guns; new recruits became tank experts. According to estimates by the U.S. military, in one month in 1945, the cumulative number of soldiers watching training films was 18.5 million in the United States, 53 million in Europe, and a large number of soldiers watched them in other regions as well. These films covered everything from hygiene to artillery fire, greatly shortening military training time.

Today, this wartime experience is being widely applied in the United States to make education faster, richer, more useful, and more lasting.

Lively cartoons have made Mickey Mouse a household name, and now films enable students to quickly understand the amazing workings of the human nervous system, or the flow of blood, or the solemn rhythm of the solar system. From films, biology students can watch a frog egg grow into a mature frog, shortening a fifteen-week natural science course into ten minutes. As David Walker, a superintendent in Evanston, said, "Although I can't go to Antarctica, Byrd's expedition camera can bring it to me."

Using films, great actors bring the beauty of literature into the classroom. Experiments conducted by scientists in large universities can be "reincarnated" countless times so that students in the most remote schools can witness them as well. Various specialized educational films are now being produced in the United States.

Education is not just about knowing a variety of unrelated facts. Unless these facts are woven into real life, they are futile. This is the ideal that all great educators hold for true education. Do educational films make their ideals easier to achieve? Educational films do not diminish the importance of excellent teachers, just as telescopes have not eliminated astronomers. They simply provide better educational tools, making excellent teachers even better.

### New Year's Day

— Chen Meng'an

I endure the chill in my worn-out fur coat from the past year, choosing kind words to ease my heart,
The clamorous sounds of spring startle and kill, the taste of the world is a mix of bitterness and spice;
Don't lament old age just because of my short temples, I want to empty the long bottle and enjoy myself,
Sitting here, I feel the first rays of sunshine returning with the warmth, let no one say my mouth is dry and lips parched.

### New Year's Eve

— Chen Meng'an

Tomorrow is the New Year, the long night hurries the short watch,
Firecrackers compete from a thousand homes, lamp flowers cut open;
Sleepless, the cold penetrates the screen, leaning drunkenly, I pour a cup,
Past events are recalled in vain, my head turns alone in the long night.

### New Applications of Couplets

—

In the newspapers of Pingjin, I saw the Spring Festival couplets of Shanghai Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan. Local authorities and celebrities here also wrote and distributed couplets to businesses and households. The wording is sharp and relevant, with a sense of the times. The practical application of couplets is becoming increasingly significant. Paired literature is a unique treasure of Chinese characters, something that other countries in the world cannot have. Because Chinese characters are "square and monosyllabic," each character occupies the same space, so it can establish the fabric of paired writing. One tone aligns with one tone, and one form aligns with one form. This is absolutely not something that Western writing, with its connected phonemes and uneven lengths, can do. Paired writing is used everywhere in various literary styles, but it is most evident in couplets. Couplets are purely woven with paired writing, and they are more neat and clear than poems, songs, and rhapsodies. Therefore, the study of various types of paired writing must be based on couplets, and couplets independently become a form of literature, suitable for celebrations, mourning, inscriptions, humor, gardens, residences, and journeys. The most popular among the public are Spring Festival couplets, because at the beginning of the New Year, every household likes to paste up a brand-new pair of door couplets, which brings a sense of renewal.

The beginning of Spring Festival couplets is said to be the five-character couplet of Shu Mengchang, which was intended to be auspicious. But later it expanded, with well-wishing ones such as "National Grace and Family Celebration," "Longevity and Abundant Years," "The Emperor's Virtue is as Great as Heaven and Earth," "The Imperial Grace is as Deep as Rain and Dew," "The Imperial Grace is as Vast as Spring," and "Civil Governance Radiates with Sunlight." There are also scholarly complaints, such as "Touching my heart, only Heaven is reliable," and "Contentment should be tolerated by the world," such as "For ten years, my heart has been colder than plum blossoms," and "One night of spring follows the sound of firecrackers." There are also those that are closely related to the industry, such as the coal shop's "Giant ancient forests burn for the rest of time," and "Ten thousand families rely on firewood to transmit the fire," such as the barbershop's "Coming are all hat-adjusting guests," and "Going, there should be no head-scratching people," which are appropriate for the time and scene, and have implications, with clever puns, all of which are excellent works. As for the bathhouse's "Before the golden rooster crows, the soup is already heated," and "The red sun rises, and the hall is full of guests," that is too realistic, with no implied meaning, not enough literary value. As for the most popular couplet since the Republic of China, "Men and women have equal rights, the public says the public is right, the mother-in-law says the mother-in-law is right," and "Lunar and solar calendars are combined, you celebrate your New Year, I celebrate my New Year," it is very interesting, with considerable irony towards all contradictory and complex phenomena. But if researched, then "the public says the public is right, the mother-in-law says the mother-in-law is right" are two old sayings. It expresses the meaning of living together in a family, and the difficulty for a wife between two mothers-in-law, similar to the meaning, and has no connection with "equal rights for men and women," and can only be regarded as borrowing.

In all categories, there is a very common couplet representing the national character of the old era, using "loyalty, honesty, and peace" as the common standard, such as "Loyalty and honesty leave room for maneuver," "Peace cultivates infinite natural opportunities," "Loyalty and honesty are passed down through generations," "Poetry and books are passed down from generation to generation," "There is a way to pass down the family, only to be honest and generous," and "There is nothing strange in life, but to be sincere." Many families use elegant calligraphy, carved on the gate, vermilion background with black characters, finely lacquered. Every New Year, they only wash and lacquer it once, because it has no timeliness, but has a permanent symbolic nature. People who are good at collecting customs can know that the Chinese nation is a truly peace-loving nation. In a world of natural selection and competition, they often suffer immediate losses, but the sincere expression of love for peace is better than advocating peace while actually abusing power, such as Germany and Japan during the war. This is something we must have confidence in. But in the ever-changing world trends of modern times, it is also a fact that traditional moral concepts alone are not enough to cope with. Therefore, those old couplets have a need for renewal.

In recent years, Spring Festival couplets have a brand-new look. The elements that constitute them can be summed up in two phrases: "Couplets become sloganized" and "Slogans become coupletized."

Why do couplets need to be sloganized? Because although the old-style couplets also had meaning and style, they had been in use for a long time and were full of stagnation, unable to meet the needs of the new era. In order to keep up with current affairs and remind the people, they had to adopt a slogan style. That is, clear and concise meaning, simple and powerful syntax, so that the public is shocked and inspired to be strong and capable. Since the May Fourth Movement, all new impetus, culture, politics, diplomacy, and the progress of international status have mostly benefited from slogan propaganda. Spring Festival couplets are something that has been seen by thousands of households in different places but with the same customs since ancient times, and it is incredibly convenient to use them for propaganda. Therefore, making them sloganized is indeed a convenient method that takes advantage of the situation.

Why do slogans need to be coupletized? Slogans are free verses, and even if they are very powerful, they can move the eyes and stimulate nerves, but they pass away quickly and are not easily spread among the public. Therefore, if you want to create a profound and universal impression, paired writing and rhyme are the most superior functions, especially in Chinese, where the structure is most convenient due to the square shape and single sound of the characters. Wenxin Diaolong said: "Creation gives form, taking the body must be double, the divine principle is used, things are not isolated. The heart generates words, cutting hundreds of thoughts, high and low need each other, naturally forming pairs." The ears, eyes, limbs of the human body, are divided into left and right, the two wings and feet of birds, the four hooves of beasts, are also paired, and even the construction and manufacturing of various objects can be verified. Although there is a distinction between ancient prose and parallel prose in Chinese literature, the sentences in so-called prose are often in pairs. Diaolong cited Tao's praise of "Doubts about guilt are light, doubts about merit are heavy," and Yichen's "Fullness invites loss, humility invites benefit." Saying "How to seek rhetoric, just to be in pairs," is not deliberately pairing, but naturally becoming paired. Ancient prose is like this, and modern prose is even more common. Now, in the auditoriums of public and private institutions, there are portraits of the Premier, with "The revolution has not yet succeeded" and "Comrades still need to work hard" on the left and right, which is a couplet. When the Premier issued these two instructions, they were not originally intended to be a couplet, and those who hang the portrait for worship did not necessarily look for a pair of couplets to hang at first. However, these two sentences happen to be six characters each, and they are relatively virtual and real, and the tones are harmonious. This is what the ancient sages called "How to seek rhetoric, just to be in pairs," which is absolutely true, and unexpectedly the same.

Now, every New Year, there are Spring Festival couplets that are appropriate for the time and use all over the country. That is, there are also many couplets in the halls for celebrations or mourning or commemorations. In addition, although there are hundreds of slogans in the conference hall, horizontally and vertically, everyone feels that there should be a pair of neat couplets on the high platform in the center. Slogans written in the style of couplets will definitely be remembered more than scattered mistakes, which can be tested and known.

Thus, "Couplets become sloganized" and "Slogans become coupletized" have become landmark literary records. The characteristics of Chinese characters are further revealed through new applications, and at the same time, modern talents awaken the enthusiasm of the public with special effects through this writing organization. This is called "mutual enhancement."

### Dim and Dark Streetlights on Jiangwan Road

Theft of electricity was found, but there is no power to crack down

The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company replied in a letter: "We received your letter, based on the letter from reader Mr. Wu Bohua, who stated: 'I have been living on Jiangwan Road for nearly half a month, and the lights in my room and nearby areas were initially red and dim, and then became flickering and flickering. , as if dancing all night. Not only is this kind of light unusable, but it also affects the nerves and is harmful to health. In recent years, electricity bills have been adjusted repeatedly, and the length has increased.

Please Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant publicly respond.' We were instructed to handle it, so we sent personnel to investigate. The area of Jiangwan Road where Mr. Wu lives has been privately connected to the transmission lines set up by our company.
