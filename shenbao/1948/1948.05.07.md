### Lapham to Arrive in China Early Next Month to Oversee US Aid Program; Our Government Expresses Willingness to Fully Cooperate

[United States Information Service, Washington, 5th] The Economic Cooperation Administration announced today: Former San Francisco Mayor and shipping company president Roger Lapham has been appointed head of the Economic Cooperation Mission to China. Economic Cooperation Administrator Paul Hoffman, when making this announcement, said he was very pleased that Lapham accepted this position. Under the US Foreign Aid Act, China will receive $338 million in economic aid, to be administered by the Economic Cooperation Administration. Another $125 million is designated as a gift to China, as decided by President Truman. Economic Cooperation officials said today that the latter amount will not be within the scope of the Economic Cooperation Administration's management. Lapham declined to comment on the specifics of the Economic Cooperation Administration's China program, but said, "Anything we do that can develop China's production and help put China on a stable foundation is a big step in the right direction." He revealed that he would be traveling to Europe soon but would like to shorten his proposed three-month vacation so that he could return to Washington on May 24 to receive instructions on his new assignment. He said he expects to leave San Francisco for China in about ten days (i.e., early June). Lapham was born in New York City on December 6, 1883, and graduated from Harvard University in 1905. In the same year, he began working as a secretary at the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, becoming general manager of the company in 1925. From 1938 to 1943, he was chairman of the company's board of directors. In 1944, he was elected Mayor of San Francisco. During World War I, he served as a captain in the infantry. He also served as a member of the National Defense Mediation Board in 1941 and as a member of the National War Labor Board from 1942 to 1943. He is also a former president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Lapham visited China last June with a group of American newspaper publishers and editors. (Photo: Roger Lapham)

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 6th (Radio): Lapham is currently in New York. It is said that he has not yet had time to work on a plan. He will travel to London with his wife next Wednesday for a brief stay before starting work. He declined to comment further.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] It is learned that Lapham is expected to arrive in China around June 1.

[Our Newspaper] According to the United States Information Service: Before the new head of the US aid to China program, Roger Lapham, arrives in China, the work will be temporarily managed by Gilbert. Gilbert is currently the head of the United China Relief, and his mission will end on June 30. His management of the distribution of American relief food to the five major cities of China has won widespread praise. Gilbert's friends hope that after Lapham arrives in China early next month, he can continue to assist him.

[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, Dong Xianguang, told United Press reporters today that the Chinese government welcomes the US government's appointment of someone with management experience like Roger Lapham to oversee aid to China and is willing to fully cooperate with him to complete his mission.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Senate Specialist on Economic Adjustment Moore announced today: During the period when the newly appointed head of the aid to China delegation, Roger Lapham, is in Europe, the agency will first send an investigation team to China to study our country's current urgent needs and plan for the use of approximately $60 million in funds for the restoration of industries such as electricity, railways, and mining. The aid to China funds approved by Congress, excluding the $125 million for military purposes, are all under Lapham's supervision, including the shipment of food, oil, cotton, and other industrial raw materials. Of these, $38.8 million will be used for agricultural improvement, accounting for approximately 10% of the total. President Truman will work with Chairman Chiang to establish a Joint Rural Reconstruction Commission to guide rural development plans, composed of three American members and two Chinese members. Lapham's office is planned to be located in Shanghai or Nanjing. After analyzing the investigation team's report, he will propose methods for using the aid to China funds. At the same time, according to Lapham, he is very pleased to take on this new role. Although the aid to China funds are less than those for Europe, it is a step in the right direction.

### Legislative Yuan to Convene Tomorrow Morning; Number of Legislators Registered Today May Meet the Legal Quorum; National Government Appoints Additional Preparatory Committee Members from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] As of 6:00 PM on the 6th, the number of legislators registered for the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution had reached 227. Di Ying, Liu Keshu, Wu Shangying, Zhang Jingyu, Aimeina, Deng Feihuang, An Futing, Wang Yisheng, Yuan Jijiong, Shi Jinmo, Zhao Pei, Ni Wenya, and others registered separately in the morning and afternoon. Furthermore, the preparatory office for the first session of the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution held two discussion meetings on the morning of the 6th at 10:00 AM and in the evening at 9:00 PM to discuss various matters related to the convention. It was decided in the morning that Wu Tiecheng and Lou Tongsun would be responsible for contacting government agencies to request prompt allocation of funds in order to expedite preparations for accommodating legislators' meals, lodging, and transportation. After Wu and Lou spent the afternoon working on this, they presented a report at the evening meeting that satisfactory results had been achieved. It was generally stated that the total preparatory funds of 50 billion could be collected and used on the 7th. According to Lou Tongsun, now that enough legislators have registered to meet the quorum for the convention and the preparatory funds have been promptly allocated by the government, there are no longer any legal or technical issues preventing the meeting from taking place as scheduled on the 8th. The preparatory office has also decided to publish three announcements in the newspapers on the 8th: First, that the number of legislators registered by 6:00 PM on the evening of the 7th has legally met the quorum for the convention. Second, that in accordance with the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, the first session of the Legislative Yuan should convene on the seventh day (i.e., the 8th) after the closing of the first National Assembly. Third, that the meeting venue has been arranged by the preparatory office to be the National Assembly Hall, so the first legislators can go there to attend the meeting on the morning of the 8th. Lou said that after the Legislative Yuan convenes, it will first hold a preparatory meeting, the agenda of which will roughly be: (1) Elect a temporary chairman, (2) Discuss the method of electing the president and vice president of the Yuan, (3) Determine the rules of procedure (drafts will be drafted and submitted by several legislators), (4) Establish a committee to review the qualifications of legislators. The duration of the preparatory meeting will be determined by the Yuan itself, but it should be completed as soon as possible before the 20th, as according to Article 7 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, the first president and vice president should take office within 20 days of being elected. Counting from the day the National Assembly sent the certificates of election on the 1st, the deadline is the 20th. The Yuan should complete the various items on the agenda of the preparatory meeting before this date so that the president and vice president can take office as soon as possible and promptly nominate candidates for premier to the Legislative Yuan for the reorganization of the government. Furthermore, the National Government has recently ordered the appointment of four additional members to the preparatory office for the first session of the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution: Wang Shixian and Tang Rumei from the Democratic Socialist Party, and Liu Dongyan and Xia Taosheng from the Youth Party.

### Joint Statement by the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties

[Our Newspaper] The issue of the number of legislators from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties has currently reached a stalemate. The Youth Party representatives Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, and Chen Qitian visited Zhang Junmai at the headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party at 4:00 PM yesterday and, after discussing for more than two hours, decided to issue a joint declaration in response to Director Dong's statement yesterday, pointing out that the Kuomintang's distortion of facts using "legal arguments" is a betrayal of its promise. Members of the two parties will not attend the Legislative Yuan meeting to be held on the 8th. After the meeting, Zhang Junmai told reporters that the government's announcement of the number of seats had led to the current stalemate, and that the power to resolve the issue rests with the government, not with the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties. We oppose resolving this issue by increasing the number of legislators. We have no intention of turning the Legislative Yuan meeting into a mass gathering. When asked by reporters about Lei Zhen's visit to Shanghai to invite him to Beijing, Zhang firmly stated that he has no intention of going to Beijing at present.

Zuo Shunsheng said: "After Lei Zhen was ordered to come to Shanghai, he maintained frequent contact with the two parties and kept in touch with relevant parties in the capital by long-distance telephone at any time. He had put forward suggestions for solving the problem, but did not mention the exact number of seats."

The full text of the joint statement by the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties is as follows:

Recently, the Kuomintang authorities have repeatedly stated that the resolution of the current issue of legislators is based on the election results, with those who received the most votes being elected. Therefore, they cannot help the majority of legislators from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties who were not elected. This argument completely ignores the facts. The election of legislators this time was based on the government's distribution of ballots, and the ballots never reached the hands of the voters. Therefore, the so-called "more votes" or "fewer votes" is only the result of the government's distribution of ballots, not the result of the voters' election. Moreover, before the election, the Kuomintang authorities had already separately designated official candidates and alternate candidates for legislators, explaining that regardless of the number of votes, official candidates would remain official and alternate candidates would remain alternate. Now, they have reversed their previous statements and are distorting the facts using "legal arguments," which is a betrayal of their promise and a destruction of their credibility.

As for the statement that members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties participated in all election affairs, so the election process would not be biased, this is even further from the truth. The election offices at all levels only handled administrative matters, and the power to make all decisions rested with the Kuomintang and the government. For example, the election offices had to receive a notification from the Kuomintang authorities before they could issue certificates of election. The fact that the list of legislators was not decided by a meeting of the election offices but by a meeting of the central cadres of the Kuomintang is enough to illustrate the rest.

In short, what we are striving for is the establishment of a democratic political framework, which is based on the people's genuine voting and a genuine majority and minority. With this voting and this majority and minority, and with more than two parties forming the legislative body, there can be proper discussion and exchange of opposing views. The fact that the ballots in this election of legislators did not reach the hands of the people is known and seen by everyone. The Kuomintang authorities have created this unreasonable and illegal situation and excluded the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties. Therefore, the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties will not be able to participate in this one-party-dominated Legislative Yuan. They can only contribute to the country in their capacity as citizens, remaining in the opposition.

### Total Amount of Special Relief Donation in Shanghai Increased to 8.5 Trillion Yuan by Supervisory Committee; 333 Importers and Exporters Listed as Targets

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The quota for special relief donations in Shanghai was originally set at 5.5 trillion yuan. The Supervisory Committee decided at its meeting on the 6th to increase it by another 3 trillion yuan, bringing the total amount to 8.5 trillion yuan. At the regular meeting of the Supervisory Committee on the 6th, Supervisory Committee member Lu Qian spoke about the slow progress of the donation campaign, believing that the committee had made a lot of noise but accomplished little. Since the start of the meetings, not a single penny had been raised, which was useless, and even if the target was met in the future as expected, the currency value would have changed. Chairman Wang Yunwu then presented this opinion for discussion, and it was finally decided to increase the donation quota for each district in order to ensure practical use. Secondly, a discussion was held on the fact that Shanghai importers and exporters had made significant profits from exchanging foreign currency at official rates. It was decided that these merchants who had exchanged foreign currency for 10,000 gold yuan or more would be subject to the special relief donation. According to statistics, the list of such merchants in Shanghai reaches 333, and the Supervisory Committee decided to strengthen the process. The meeting also appointed Liu Butong and Jiang Yong to take this list to Shanghai to handle the matter.

### Gu Yuquan Reports at the National Economic Commission; Rumors of Foreign Exchange Opening are False; Measures for Exchange of Silver Coins and Silver Categories Revised; Spring Silkworm Cocoon Purchase Price Formula Proposed

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The National Economic Commission held its 39th meeting on the afternoon of the 6th. Chairman Wang Yunwu and Deputy Secretary-General Gu Yuquan first reported on prices, saying that prices had been relatively stable for the past six weeks, but recently, the price of gold and US dollars had suddenly risen sharply due to rumors that foreign exchange would soon be opened, which was not the case. The following important proposals were then discussed:

A. Regarding the political proposal on how to strengthen the implementation of the public utility price adjustment formula, the city councils of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beiping had all expressed opinions on the price increase of public utilities. The Executive Yuan instructed the National Economic Commission to convene a review meeting with the ministries of Economy, Transportation, and Interior, as well as the Nanjing and Shanghai municipal governments, to conduct research and propose five comprehensive opinions. It was resolved to pass the review opinions.

B. The Ministry of Finance requested the issuance of measures to prohibit the circulation of silver coins and silver categories. After discussion, it was deemed that prohibiting the circulation of silver coins was practically difficult and was not approved. The circulation of silver coins and silver categories is still permitted, but the measures for exchanging silver coins and silver categories for legal tender previously established by the Ministry of Finance should be revised. The exchange rate will be calculated and announced by the Central Bank with reference to the world silver price and the foreign exchange market price set by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee.

C. Of the quota for pharmaceuticals in the fifth and sixth quarters, a total of $400,000 was decided to be increased, with $400,000 per quarter and $800,000 for the two quarters. As for where to allocate the additional $400,000 from, it was decided to be studied by the Transportation Management Committee.

D. For the spring silkworm cocoon purchase price, a calculation formula has been proposed, based on the price of 44.77 yuan per dan of fresh silkworms in 1937. The purchase price of fresh silkworms at the end of April this year is as follows: 18 million yuan per city dan in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, 17 million yuan per city dan in the Hangzhou area, 11 million yuan per city dan in Chongqing, and 18 million yuan per city dan in Guangzhou. If the overall price index rises by 20%, the Four Joint Offices will adjust it according to the price index.

[Our newspaper, Haizhou dispatch] Wang Xinzhi, the father of Wang Yousheng, the Speaker of the Guanyun County Provisional Council, was abducted by communist bandits when they captured Nanxinan Town in Guanyun County on October 17th last year, and detained in a village near Tanggou in Shuyang. The communist bandits demanded 1,500 silver dollars or 5,000 bullets from Wang Yousheng in exchange for his father, Wang Xinzhi. Wang Yousheng discussed the matter with his younger brother, Wang Yunsheng, and decided to buy bullets because 5,000 bullets could be purchased locally for 150 million yuan in local currency, while 1,500 silver dollars would be worth 45 million yuan in local currency. By April 24th, a certain number of bullets had been purchased. Wang Yousheng then used his younger brother Wang Yunsheng's position as the head of a Guannan Township Bao (self-defense unit) to transport two factory-made rifles, one Mauser pistol, and more than 2,800 bullets on two bicycles and a small cart, along with Wang Bitong, Hu Xuelun, Hu Xueru, and others, to the bandit area to redeem his father, Wang Xinzhi.

The United States suggested that during this ten-day extension, a ten-day ceasefire be implemented in Palestine, so that a negotiating committee composed of Britain, France, Belgium, and the United States could conduct discussions with the Arab countries. This proposal was forwarded to the British government by Sir Alexander Cadogan, the chief British representative to the United Nations, at the request of the United States, but the British government has rejected the proposal. The case of ending the trusteeship on May 15 has already been passed by the British Parliament and officially became law after being approved by the King. If the British government agrees to an extension, it must be approved by Parliament again. Foreign Secretary Bevin also solemnly declared during Thursday's foreign policy debate in the House of Commons that Britain's decision to hand over the trusteeship on May 15 would not be changed.

[United Press, New York, 5th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee's twelve-nation sub-committee, chaired by Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu, held its first secret meeting today to try to resolve the Palestine issue. Cuban representative Belt proposed that if the Jews and Arabs cannot reach an agreement on the situation in the Holy Land within a certain period, United Nations agencies should conduct a referendum in Palestine to form a provisional government in order to restore order. However, this provisional government is different from the US's proposal for UN trusteeship, and it is expected to be more easily accepted by both the Jews and Arabs. The sub-committee voted 8 to 0 to continue holding secret meetings to discuss the matter. The Soviet Union, Poland, and Guatemala all voted against it, and China abstained.

### British Prime Minister Supports Western European Alliance; Believes War Can Be Avoided for Now; European Federation Plan Difficult to Implement at Present
[Reuters, London, 5th Dispatch] Prime Minister Attlee stated in his speech on the second day of the foreign policy debate in the House of Commons today that he does not believe that war cannot be avoided, and he does not believe that any people in the world want war. But he also said that if war does break out, it will be because certain people take the opportunity. Attlee also said that Britain undoubtedly needs a Western European alliance, but Britain cannot only focus on one continent, Britain is interested in all continents in the world. Britain has tried its best to make the United Nations structure strong, and although there are various difficulties, he is not discouraged. The United Nations Charter has provisions for regional defense agreements. These agreements are not aggressive. Similar agreements already exist in Eastern Europe, and it is inevitable that Western Europe or the rest of the world should also have similar agreements. The British Commonwealth has generally agreed to the proposal for a Western European alliance, but the British government still wishes to convene a Commonwealth meeting as soon as possible to discuss the matter.

[Reuters, London, 5th Dispatch] The foreign policy debate in the House of Commons discussed the motion for a European Union, jointly proposed by 191 members of parliament from various parties. The motion suggested that the first step is to establish a Western European Commission to coordinate social, economic, and defense policies, and then establish a Western European democratic federation, stipulating common citizenship and based on representative government. In answering this motion, Attlee said that he could not express agreement with each of the suggestions in it, because these suggestions cannot be implemented practically immediately, but he declared that the government would agree to take the establishment of a Western European alliance as its final goal for the further establishment of a world federation.

Eden believes that although the international situation is not hopeless, it is extremely dangerous. He believes that only with strength as a backing can successful negotiations be conducted with the Soviet Union. He believes that the Soviet Union must understand that any tricks or sabotage are not enough to force the Western people to change their way of life. He said that when Western countries consider plans to increase their strength, they do not contain any intention of provocation or threat of war. Western countries have the sincerity to improve relations with the Soviet Union, but they refuse to seek improved relations through appeasement and weakness.

He believes that not only Japan but even all countries in the Far East are eager to know its position, especially the level of Japanese industry, which is of the greatest concern to the general public. He said that the British government hopes that Britain and other powers will have the opportunity to carefully consider any major reforms that the United States wishes to implement regarding its economic policy towards Japan. He believes that the Allied countries must find a way to resolve all the problems after the war. Britain still insists on its previous request, that the peace conference with Japan must include representatives from all countries that have always participated in the war against Japan. Speaking of the Soviet Union's expansion policy, he said that we should not be satisfied with passive preventive measures, but must unite to promote our positive ideology. Mayhew continued, we all want to see Spain become a member of the international family, but Franco must step down first.

### Suggestions to Revise the United Nations Charter; Secretary of State Marshall and Ambassador Austin Express Opposition; Austin Also Advocates Military Aid to Friendly Countries
[United Press, Washington, 5th Dispatch] US Ambassador to the United Nations Austin requested on the 5th that Congress not revise the United Nations Charter, but that it could strengthen the military status of countries friendly to the United States. Secretary of State Marshall and Austin both warned against attempting to revise the United Nations Charter. Austin told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that any attempt to change the form of the United Nations now would only result in destroying the world organization created for world peace. He declared that one way to strengthen this world organization is to militarily strengthen countries friendly to the United States. Austin and Secretary Marshall both said that some people have suggested reorganizing the United Nations, even if the Soviet Union does not participate if necessary. This is a mistake. Secretary Marshall opposes the proposal to abolish the veto power in the event of aggression. Austin also said that it is currently not possible for major powers to agree on revising the United Nations Charter. In addition to providing military assistance to friendly countries, Austin also suggested: (1) The European Recovery Program must be successfully completed; (2) The US military must be strengthened; (3) The "like-minded countries" should be united, such as the Rio Defense Treaty and the Western European Five-Nation Alliance.

### Public Utility Prices This Month to Not Rise by More Than 20 Percent; Mayor Invites Council and Committee Members to Discuss; Many Still Advocate Restoring Indirect Subsidy Policy
[Our Newspaper Report] The issue of public utility prices for this city in May was discussed and decided by Mayor Wu at a council meeting yesterday. If the central government does not accept the City Council's request to restore subsidies, then the maximum price increase this month cannot exceed 20 percent. It is understood that the four items of water, electricity, gas, and telephone may be the first to implement price increases starting tomorrow.

Mayor Wu invited members of the Council's Public Utilities Committee and the Public Utilities Investigation Committee yesterday to discuss the issue of public utility prices. Speaker Pan, Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao, and more than 40 members of the two committees attended. Zhang Xiwei, the chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, also participated. The Mayor explained that the government has no right to force companies to operate at a loss. The current profit of public utilities is only 8% annual interest. As for the subsidy policy, it was implemented for three months last year, and the consequence was that the government issued more currency. If prices are forcibly frozen and the Mayor refuses to pay, the consequence will be that the companies cut off the supply of water and electricity, close down, or ask the government to take over, at which point the situation will be unimaginable. The city government's current solution is to try to reduce the factors that cause high public utility prices. After repeated negotiations with the National Bank regarding the foreign exchange needed for public utility materials, advance foreign exchange settlement for one month is no longer a problem, but the current foreign exchange rate has risen by 27% compared to the end of March. Regarding the coal problem, this city's public utilities need 45,900 tons per month. The Fuel Management Committee's allocation price for May has increased by 45% compared to the previous month, requiring 9.464 million yuan per ton. After repeated consultations with the Fuel Management Committee, 15,900 tons can be allocated and sold at a price of 7.321 million yuan per ton, another 15,000 tons will be allocated at 9.2 million yuan per ton, and the remaining 15,000 tons will be allocated at the new price for May. Therefore, the price of half of the fuel coal can be similar to that of last month. The workers' cost of living index has increased by 20.7%, and the employees' index has increased by 27%. If calculated according to this, the price increase of public utilities in May should be around 50%. After efforts, it can be reduced to about 25%. The city government has made its best efforts in this regard. Are there any other ways to reduce it further? I hope you can give more guidance, and the city government will do its best to implement them.

Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao then reported on the situation of contacting relevant parties regarding the materials needed by various public utility companies, and said that the companies have tried their best to tighten expenses where possible, and have also increased efficiency.

The councilors spoke enthusiastically, mostly advocating the restoration of the subsidy policy. Some also pointed out that the Fuel Management Committee's allocation of coal is not considering the overall livelihood of the people, but is for the purpose of profit. Tang Chengzong and Lu Yinchu believe that if a price increase is unavoidable, it should at least be halved from the 25% proposed by Mayor Wu, that is, an increase of 12.5%.

Speaker suggests two points. Then Speaker Pan rose to speak, expressing that if it is rigidly stipulated that public utility prices are not allowed to increase, various undesirable things may happen. He also stated two points: (1) Requesting that the Fuel Management Committee's coal price not increase, and that the allocation price of coal for public utilities not increase for at least three months. It would be better for the allocation price of other coal to increase a little more. Otherwise, the central government should be responsible for stimulating price increases for disregarding public opinion. In addition, the central government is requested to pre-settle foreign exchange for public utilities for three months. It would be better to settle a little less foreign exchange for other purposes. If the central government can adopt this, the factors that stimulate other price increases due to the increase in public utility prices will definitely be reduced or eliminated. (2) There are shortcomings in the public utility automatic adjustment method. It is hoped that the Council's Public Utilities Investigation Committee can expedite the investigation. Speaker Pan also accused that there are rumors that several public utility companies have a large amount of savings deposited in one or two commercial banks at low interest rates, and the banks use these funds to purchase foreign exchange on the black market. Both the companies and the banks should be responsible for this situation, and it is hoped that the authorities can conduct a detailed investigation.

Mayor Wu finally summarized the councilors' opinions. The percentage of public utility price increases in May will be based on the 20.7% increase in the cost of living index for workers in April, with a maximum of no more than 20%. The city government will negotiate with various companies. The meeting adjourned at around 7 p.m.

As for the Sanmen Bay refugee agricultural reclamation plan, the Ministry of Social Affairs hopes that local people and charitable education groups will jointly initiate and sponsor it with relevant agricultural agencies, and the government will definitely do its best to assist. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is now starting to collect all relevant materials on Sanmen Bay agricultural reclamation, and plans to send personnel to conduct on-site inspections first.

### Allotted Coal Ball Price: 120,000 Yuan Per Dan; Decision on Whether to Change to Allotting Coal Chunks to be Discussed Further
[Our newspaper report] The price of allotted coal balls for industrial and professional workers this period has been decided. It is 120,000 yuan per dan, a doubling from the previous period. The People's Food Allocation Association advocated changing to allotting 50 jin of coal chunks (because 50% of the coal balls are coal slag, so 50 jin of coal chunks is equivalent to 100 jin of coal balls) to save about 30,000 yuan per dan in coal ball processing fees. However, because families are more accustomed to using coal balls than coal chunks, the Social Affairs Bureau will discuss the decision with the People's Allocation Association again this weekend, and it can be announced next week.

Restrictions on Remittances and Cash Transfers Between Shanghai and Guangzhou to be Lifted; Ministry of Finance Agrees; Crackdown on Gold and Currency Black Market to Address Root Causes and Symptoms
[United Credit Bureau News] The directors of the four gold control bureaus of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou, Li Lixia, Shi Kuiling, Lin Chongyong, Gao Fang, etc., traveled together from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 3rd of this month to report on their work and offer sincere suggestions on current financial controls. The Ministry of Finance adopted all the suggestions made by Li and others based on their actual experiences in their respective regions. It is expected that the financial control policy will undergo a thorough improvement, and it will be gradually implemented soon. The four directors have completed their official duties in Nanjing. Except for Shi, who returned directly to Tianjin from Nanjing, Li, Lin, and Gao returned to Shanghai by train on the 6th. According to Li Lixia, who spoke to reporters, the group made several suggestions to the Ministry of Finance regarding financial control issues, and the Ministry is drafting measures based on their opinions. The Ministry of Finance has agreed to lift the restrictions on remittances and cash transfers between Shanghai and Guangzhou. The gold and currency black market has recently become rampant again, and capital flight is a major reason. Secondly, the reward system also has an impact. In addition to finding other ways to prevent capital flight, the bonus issue will revert to its original method. Part of the bonus will be transferred from the treasury to local relief efforts. Rewards to informants, executive agencies, and assisting agencies will be issued immediately after a case is solved. Using the money of speculators to provide local relief is the most ideal solution. Li believes that the implementation of this measure will make the crackdown on the gold and currency black market more effective. According to the original bonus method, informants receive 30%, executive and assisting agencies receive 35%, and the treasury receives 35%. If there is no informant, the treasury receives 50%, and the remaining 50% is given to the executive and assisting agencies. Now, the treasury portion is being transferred to local relief efforts. Li has consulted with Mayor Wu and decided to establish a bonus committee to be solely responsible for it. Regarding the crackdown on the gold and currency black market, Li said that short-term measures will continue as usual. The fundamental solution is being studied. Li believes that the current economic situation is indeed serious. The reasons for this are currency inflation and capital flight to Hong Kong. Today's fundamental problem is the Hong Kong issue. Because Hong Kong is a free market for our legal tender, the Hong Kong market must be controlled in order to control the domestic market. Having this back door is a major threat. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments are currently negotiating in Nanjing. The previous Sino-Hong Kong agreement only covered smuggling, and that agreement has been quite effective. This negotiation will be of great help to our economy, and it is rumored that a Sino-Hong Kong economic agreement will be signed to solve the problem of capital flight to Hong Kong.

### After Authorities Decide on Stabilization Measures, Rice Prices Fall Slightly Yesterday
The rice market rebounded slightly yesterday because prices had risen too much in recent days, and those holding goods could not help but worry about the situation. There were more sales at the opening in the morning, and the authorities suppressed prices, making people inevitably feel soft. The early market once fell to more than 100,000, but the downstream demand remained strong, and Wuxi prices did not fall, so it stopped falling and rose again. As a result, Baigeng in the Nanshi market fell by 50,000, early Baodao fell by 100,000, and Baiyuan alone rose again, opening as high as 5.3 million yuan. Baigeng in the Beishi market fell by 50,000, early Baodao fell by 230,000, and Te Gao Geng stood still at 4.85 million. The two markets received 4,655 stones.

Flour: The price continued to rise. Bingchuan flour closed at 1.64 million, the lowest was 1.61 million, an increase of 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Lao Che finally rose by 20,000, and Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and Pingding were stable. Nanpai flour was said to be firm. Bran was collected by the Hakka gang, rising by 340,000 yuan. Wheat remained at the original price of 2.4 million.

Cereals: Yellow soybeans were down 50,000 in the morning, but the Shantou gang bought them, turning the market active and adding 30,000. Corn was barely accepted in Qingdao, and the market was stable. Red sorghum was high and stable, but the market was weak. Green beans stopped being accepted by the Hakka gang, falling by 200,000. Red beans were down 100,000, and there were very few green beans traded. Sesame rose by 200,000, and raw peanuts were stable early and firm later, rising slightly by 200,000.

Edible oil: The market was weak first and then rebounded, and all closed firm and strong. Soybean oil opened at 10 million, but oil factories did not open later, and retail sales were very high, rebounding to 10.02 million. Finally, Dayou soybean oil was 10.03 million, an increase of 50,000. Tai'an and Jiangbei Jitung raw oil rose by 200,000 and 300,000, respectively. Raw vegetable oil and sesame oil were still stable, and the price of Xiaoche sesame oil alone fell by 200,000. Soybean cake was collected by the Shantou gang, rising by 230,000.

### Yarn Prices Soar, Cotton Cloth Follows Suit
Yesterday, the price of cotton yarn rose again, with buyers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other groups constantly taking it, and the market atmosphere was unusually high. The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was already up 6 million, and then it was raised to 284 million at the close due to the hype of the table gang, an increase of 14 million compared to the previous day. The new high price of 21-count Double Horse yarn was 199 million, and it was finally pulled back by 10 million compared to the previous day because the sales to customers were still sluggish. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts from 89 million to 14.5 million.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was very healthy, with buyers from Tianjin, Hankou, Guangdong, and other groups. Although it was the period for the opening of fabrics for construction, the rising trend was still strong. The opening price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 5.57 million yuan, and then it was raised to 690,000 yuan due to the constant influx of northern gangs and the successive absorption of powerful factions. After a long period of hesitation by cloth merchants and retailers who sold, they heard that the yarn price and the stock market were rising, and cloth merchants and dyeing factories turned from selling to buying, jumping to a new high of 5.78 million at the end. It rose by 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day and was finally hyped to 5.8 million yuan. In addition, the prices of fine cloth, serge, straight tribute, twill, and other products rose in unison.

Also, the price of trumpet children's fine cloth supplied by Fangjian Company was 5.38 million yuan, and there were many applicants. The approved purchase order was 200,000 yuan, but it was difficult to find, and the situation was quite profitable.

The opening time of the yarn market in this city has always been from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM every day. In order to adjust the appropriate trading time, the industry association announced yesterday that the opening time would be moved forward by one hour, from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM.

Free Talk An Example
Pingzhai

A small example can prove the seriousness of the refugee problem in Shanghai.

Every day, I take a rickshaw from my residence in Hongkou to my office in Huangpu District, and Zhapu Road Bridge is a must-pass. At this time last year, whenever the weather was cloudy and rainy and the road was muddy, I would always ask the rickshaw puller to stop at the bridge approach, get out and walk across the bridge myself, and then get back in the rickshaw and continue on. It seems to have been in the second half of last year that there were always a few children with pale faces waiting at the bridge approach, specializing in pushing rickshaws or pedicabs onto the bridge, but there were only three or four of them in total. After they pushed you to the top of the bridge, you would give them a five-hundred-yuan bill, and they would say thank you to you, very satisfied.

But things are very different lately. Pushing a car across the bridge seems to have become a very prosperous business. At the northern and southern approaches of each bridge over the Suzhou River, there is a big boss who specializes in managing the "pushers." He tightly organizes these "pushers," and every "pusher" has to hand over the money he gets to him, who then distributes it evenly, while he himself gets a cut without doing any work. I have witnessed a "big boss" distributing money many times. My impression is that the faces of the children pushing the cars (now adults are also participating) are still pale, while the "big boss" is well-dressed and shows no signs of malnutrition.

What about those who are unwilling to join these "pushing organizations"? They have no place to stand at the bridge approach (they will be beaten if they squeeze in), so they have to dump their labor at a low price. To win over customers, they would rather push a longer distance and take less money. As a result, the line of pushers waiting by the side of the road is gradually getting longer and longer. To take Zhapu Road Bridge as an example again, the line of pushers on the north side of the bridge has gradually extended from the bridge approach to Wuchang Road, and Tanggu Road has recently extended to Kunshan Road. As soon as your car arrives at the intersection of Zhapu Road and Kunshan Road, seven or eight people will rush to beg you to let them push your rickshaw. They are willing to push you across three horizontal roads and then push you onto the bridge, but the requested reward is the same as those who push the car from the bridge approach, only five thousand yuan: the price of a large pancake.

The competition is so fierce because there are more and more competitors; and the reason why there are more and more competitors is that there are more and more refugees coming to Shanghai.

I am very sympathetic to the refugees who maintain their lives by pushing rickshaws at the bridge approach. They exchange their own labor for pancakes to fill their stomachs, which can be said to be not ashamed of the sky and not ashamed of people. However, there are already so many competitors, and there is a tendency to continue to increase, so in the future, this pancake will become more and more difficult to get. That is to say, one or two strong men who wander to Shanghai may be able to survive by their own strength, but today's refugee problem has become a whole social problem, and it is not easy to solve.

This situation reminds me of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (NRRA), but the number of people in the country in urgent need of relief is far greater than when the NRRA was established, but the NRRA has already died. Moreover, even if the NRRA still exists today, I am afraid that it will be difficult to focus on the relief of these refugees. As far as I know, before the NRRA received the relief supplies from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), it first proposed a very specific and detailed post-disaster relief program. After this "program" was approved by UNRRA, UNRRA only issued the necessary materials listed in this "program" with a discount of 70-80%. Regarding the refugee part, this "program" originally had plans for repatriation and work relief, but these plans did not include the huge number of refugees in the past two years.

We think with common sense that the local government should be responsible for emergency relief, but what we hear and see is that a Mr. in the Social Affairs Bureau is promoting the incredibly clever "no-give-and-move," and when the refugees raise funds to purchase rickshaws and ask to live by pedaling rickshaws in the suburbs, the authorities of the Public Works Bureau refuse to issue licenses! We ordinary people are not surprised by the latter—the Public Works Bureau is busy studying and adjusting the prices of public utilities all day long, so naturally it is no wonder that they have no time to take care of the refugees.

However, there are more and more refugees on the streets of Shanghai, supporting the old and the young, and life is difficult and miserable. If this continues, we can see that those who are suffering from poverty and illness today will soon be reduced to ditches. The people are displaced, and the government cannot ignore it. Since the local government's response is like this, we have no choice but to look forward to the central government. At this time when the government is undergoing a new look, I hope that all the officials will take on the virtue of the heavens to cherish life and think of a way—do not learn from the example of the old men in the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Works Bureau!

Projection Psychology
Shi Yu

Just as the light of the moon is projected from the sun, the observation, thought, or evaluation of people towards each other is often projected from nothing and goes away. When you are happy, you feel that the subordinates are taking off their hats for you, the proprietress is flirting with you, and the birds are singing for you; when you are "low-key," you feel that the subordinates are "arguing" with you, the old lady is ridiculing you, and the birds are mourning for you. When your pocket is very light, you feel like people know you are a poor man. When you are missing half a button on your coat, or there is a small hole in the corner of your cheongsam, you will never go out again, as if everyone on the road will see that you are missing half a button or have a hole. The girl next door has no intention of falling flowers, but you think she has affection for you. As long as you fall in love with this girl, occasionally smile, you think she is smiling at you; occasionally glare, you think she is glaring at you. A famous "unrequited love" story says: A Viennese young woman fell in love with the famous violinist Paganini, she actually found that Paganini also fell in love with her, because every time he finished playing and bowed deeply to the audience, he always felt that he was smiling at her. Such examples can probably be found a dozen in the book "Dream of the Red Chamber." It is even more easy to pick up in the real environment, maybe you have had such experience.

It is difficult for us to observe ourselves accurately. Even in terms of the simplest appearance, looking in the mirror, we see ourselves as beautiful when we are happy, and we see ourselves as unattractive when we are depressed. The observation of the inner heart is naturally even more difficult. Unless we can get rid of "emotion," don't even think about observing others accurately. As long as I dislike you a little bit, I will see too many of your disadvantages and too few of your advantages. If we look at Napoleon with the eyes of a hero, he is a hero; if we look at Napoleon with the eyes of a dwarf, he is a dwarf. Just like the fickle Sun Wukong, eighteen friends can see you as eighteen different appearances, because everyone uses the heart of a villain to shoot your gentleman's belly.

A housewife who likes to be greedy for petty gains expresses doubts about the electricity company's bill, wondering if the company authorities will charge an extra degree. A lonely friend defends himself in his diary: "It's not that I don't want to be close to others, it's that others don't want to be close to me." But this is the most reliable mirror: if you often feel that people are guessing at you, you are a suspicious person; if you often feel that people are jealous of you, you are a jealous person. If you often see the bright side of things, you are a happy person; if you often see the dark side of things, you are a sad person. If you feel that others are not friendly, it is mostly because you are not friendly first. Two friends often break up in the following circumstances: A and B have a disagreement over a trivial matter, A thinks that B has bad intentions towards him, and B thinks that A has bad intentions towards him. The two people project like this, and although both people are very kind, but as time goes on, the projection becomes more and more "unkind," and they have to cut off their seats.

The relationship between people is like this. The relationship between countries is no different. If the suspicion between countries exists for a long time, war will eventually break out one day. Historians tell us that in the 3,357 years from 1496 BC to 1861 AD, there were 3,130 years in war and only 227 years of peace. That is, on average, rest for one year every thirteen years, and then fight for another thirteen years, repeating like this. The human love of war is just like friends cutting off their seats, and it is mostly made by projection.

Siberian Wonders
Leng Leng

According to the research of archaeologists and geologists, tens of thousands of years ago, in the area connecting Europe and Asia, there was a kind of ancient giant elephant. They retreated northward in the same direction as the glaciers. When they arrived in Siberia, they could not move forward because there were too many swamps. After the final struggle, countless giant elephants finally sank into the extremely cold muddy swamps and froze to death in the ice and snow that did not melt all year round.

These giant elephants, although they have gone through tens of thousands of years, are still preserved very well in the natural large refrigerator. Not only the meat, fur, but also the undigested food in their stomachs is preserved intact; like bunches of moss, cattails, and wild grass, and even have not been chewed in the mouth.

Therefore, many Siberian farmers, after discovering these giant elephants, cut off large pieces of their red meat to feed their dogs, no different from taking food from the underground food warehouse.

The Ula grass that grows in Siberia has been spreading and dying continuously for thousands of years. The dead grass leaves rotten roots, which are laid on the ground in two layers, intertwined and twisted, and finally dissolve into mud, forming the surface layer. Because it is composed of grass roots, the soil on this surface layer is particularly soft, like a large piece of sponge tens of feet thick, hanging in the air loosely, both soft and elastic; when people walk on it, even places dozens of miles away will vibrate, as if dancing on a sofa bed.

More on Miswritten Characters
Yi Yun

I have previously listed stories of miswritten characters, which were published in this newspaper. Now I remember two more things, which are described separately as follows.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I took refuge in eastern Sichuan. The culture there was notoriously closed. A certain commissioner took the promotion of culture as his own responsibility and convened a conference on the birthday of Confucius. A certain local gentleman also took the stage to speak. His opening remark was "Today is the birthday of Confucius," but he misread the character "birthday" (誕) as "extend" (延). His disciples knew he was wrong and whispered, "Birthday..." The commissioner realized his mistake and hurriedly changed his statement to "Today is Confucius's extend..." As a result, the audience burst into laughter. This is because people in Sichuan call pickled eggs "salt eggs" (鹽蛋), which sounds exactly like the commissioner's "extend birthday" (延誕), so it caused a riot in the hall.

Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang was originally named Jiangtian Temple, named after the Qing Emperor's imperial stele "Jiangtian Yilan" (江天一覽). It is recalled that in the notes of ancient people, it was recorded that when the Qing Emperor wrote this stele, he actually mistakenly wrote the character "view" (覽) as "sense" (覺). After writing it, he knew that it was wrong, but he did not know how to write the character "view." Surrounded by ministers, he hesitated to write, which was quite difficult to deal with. A certain attendant was very clever and repeatedly praised the imperial writing, knelt down and asked to be given it, and stretched out his palm in a begging gesture, with the character "view" (覽) clearly written in the hall. The Qing Emperor took the opportunity to give him the wrongly written paper, and the stele of "Jiangtian Yi Lan" (江天一覽) was rewritten.

Poet Monk Pointing Finger Monk
Fu Lu

When I was studying at Nanjing Hongzhi Lane in the early years of the Republic of China, it was close to the west of the city. Whenever I had a day off, I often climbed Qingliang Mountain and Sweeping Leaf Tower with two or three close friends. Looking into the distance, I felt that the scenery of the Southern Dynasties rushed to the bottom of my eyes. Reading the seven-character ancient poem by the Eight-Finger Monk on the wall, it was natural and free of worldliness. I still remember that the concluding sentence had lines such as "The past events of Qi and Liang are like fallen leaves, climbing the tower to sweep them all without a trace... The vastness of the universe is boundless, laughing at the moon falling and the golden basin turning." I couldn't help but yearn for it. After searching and collecting, I obtained several poems, all of which were his late works, and I also learned a little about the life of the monk. Quietly sitting in meditation, as if thinking of an old friend. I remember that his ancestors were descendants of Shangu, and one migrated to Chaling in the Song Dynasty, and another migrated to Shitan in Xiangtan at the end of the Ming Dynasty. He was born into a farmer's family, lost his mother at the age of seven, and his father went elsewhere, so he and his younger brother were supported by the neighbors. At the age of eleven, he began to study the Analects with a teacher, but before finishing the book, his father died again, and he had nothing to eat, so he grazed cattle for the farmers, still carrying a book to read. The teacher Zhou Yunfan pitied his fate and took him as a disciple, so he cooked to repay his kindness. Before long, the teacher died again. He heard that a wealthy family was looking for someone to accompany their child to read, and he gladly went to join them. When he arrived, he was provided for errands, and he was often scolded when he tried to read, which was contrary to his wishes, so he resigned and learned art. He was whipped and beaten even more severely, and broke off and rejoined several times. One day, he saw white peach blossoms blooming in the fence, lingering and reluctant to leave. Suddenly, a storm came and devastated them, and he couldn't help but cry out loud, so he became a monk at Fahua Temple in Xiangyin and burned two fingers to worship the Buddha. Later, he visited his uncle in Baling and climbed Yueyang Tower. A friend divided the rhymes and composed poems, and he sat in meditation alone, looking down at the lake, a vast expanse of blue. Suddenly, he obtained the line "The waves of Dongting send a group of musicians." When he returned and told Guo Ju, he was persuaded to write poetry, and he became more and more diligent. However, because he had little reading, he worked especially hard. If a word was not satisfactory, he felt as if he was carrying a heavy burden, to the point of forgetting sleep and food. He once had a poem that took several years to complete. Later, he traveled all over Wu and Yue, and lived in Siming for the longest time, and traveled with the famous scholars in the county. He once wrote a poem with the line "A pot of wine under the flowers." When he wrote the character "pot" (壺), he forgot its strokes, so he drew a wine pot on it. Xu Tuoxian, who was good at calligraphy, took out paper and forced him to write. After scribbling, the strokes were staggered, and the left and right were reversed, like inverted leeks. Every time there was a banquet, he would hang it on the wall, and the viewers would burst into laughter. However, his early works, such as the painting inscription, said: "One or two pine trees, three or five bamboos, grow long and desolate, only clouds come to stay." One of the ten poems in "Expressing My Feelings" said: "Last year, I went to repair my ancestors' graves, the road passed by the mulberry trees, the villagers said to me, this mulberry tree is as old as you, your father used to plow the fields under this mulberry tree, people and cattle are now gone, who do you pity now? I was speechless with emotion, and tears flowed like a spring." Not only is the mood mellow and the artistic conception is also very profound, so I have included it. The monk's secular surname was Huang, his given name was Dushan, his Dharma name was Jing'an, and his courtesy name was Jiyu. Although he was obstructed by words and fell into the path of obstacles, he was still a generation of poets. Wang Xiangqi commented that his lofty and indifferent place was very similar to Jia Dao and Yao He, and he was more skillful than Hanshan. It can be seen that his continued works are gradually surpassing Hui Xiu, which can be said to be a knowledgeable statement.

The fur and brocade of the Hun dust are lost by thousands of people, the palace of the Chu torch is burned overnight, the autumn moon and spring flowers miss the past, how can I look back and ask the Southern Dynasty!

Guest Arrival

It is always common to talk about light tea, and it is also called enjoyment to occasionally meet a guest. In difficult times, relatives and friends see each other sparsely, and old people are too lazy to read poetry and books for their children and grandchildren. The meals near the market have no various flavors, and everyone sighs at the spring river and the lack of goods.

Climbing

Climbing to the extreme, looking up to the sky, the surrounding is desolate in between, the articles of thousands of years are passed down to the sea, a building of wind and rain faces the river; the cold flowers are fragrant and the love is eternal, the flying birds are leisurely and the meaning is free, holding on to difficulties and wielding magnificent ambitions, singing loudly and leaving the world.

### Giving Serious Consideration to the Korean Crisis

The political parties of both North and South Korea have already held a joint conference in Pyongyang, unanimously expressing their opposition to a separate election in South Korea and demanding the simultaneous withdrawal of troops from Korea by the United States and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the North Korean People's Assembly has also passed a "Constitution of the Korean Democratic People's Republic" in Seoul. Thus, the Korean issue, which had been in a stalemate, seems to have reached the stage of a showdown. According to Lieutenant General Hodge, the commander of the US occupation forces, the United States is determined not to recognize this constitution and is unwilling to negotiate with North Korea. At the same time, he also flatly rejected the Pyongyang conference's request for the withdrawal of US troops from Korea. His reasoning is: "If the US troops withdraw, the North Korean communist army and its power-hungry partisans and puppets will inevitably try to control South Korea. In this way, Korea would become one of the Soviet satellite states." Since the attitude of the United States is so clear and firm, it is naturally impossible to make the United States give in. It is expected that the separate election in South Korea on May 10th will inevitably be carried out, and there is absolutely no room for change.

Due to the stationing of American and Soviet troops in the North and South of Korea, the 38th parallel has become almost the border between North and South Korea. For two and a half years, the opposition and conflict between North and South Korea have not only shown no hope of easing, but have intensified and become increasingly acute. This has made people worried that Korea will become the "Greece of the East" and may become the fuse for a third world war. Therefore, not only do the Korean people yearn for the unification, independence, and liberation of their motherland, but also the United States hopes to compromise with the Soviet Union so that the Korean issue can find a reasonable solution. However, for the past two years, the stalemate on the Korean issue has remained unresolved, forcing the United States to advocate a separate election in South Korea. The United Nations Korean Commission then decided to hold a vote on May 10th. This approach, from the American point of view, can indeed be regarded as a method of last resort. However, from the perspective of the Korean people, if South Korea holds a separate election, the consequence will inevitably be the establishment of a divided South Korean government, and the desire for reunification between the North and South will not be realized. Therefore, all Korean political parties and social groups, except for Syngman Rhee's Democratic Party, oppose the American approach of holding separate elections in South Korea. Even Mr. Kim Gu, the leader of the Korean right wing, generously stated: "If the Pyongyang conference fails, I will commit seppuku at the demarcation line between the US and Soviet occupation zones at the 38th parallel." The Soviet Union, for its part, believes that it can take advantage of the Korean people's desire for unification to undermine the American plan for a separate election in South Korea. Therefore, it has done everything possible to encourage the Pyongyang conference and the North Korean People's Assembly. Therefore, on the surface, the resolutions of the Pyongyang conference and the passage of the constitution by the North Korean People's Assembly can indeed be seen as a victory for the Korean people. However, in reality, the so-called Korean issue is nothing more than a link in the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union, and it still has no benefit for the fate of the Korean people themselves.

The development of the Korean situation to this point cannot but be said to be a failure of the US policy toward Korea, and its mistakes have caused today's bad results. Standing in the position of a third party, calmly and quietly studying the Korean issue, it is not difficult to find the errors in the US policy toward Korea.

First, the Korean people, under the oppression of Japanese imperialism, have long been awakened and demand not only national independence and liberation but also national unity and prosperity. During World War II, Korean patriots launched national liberation movements at home and abroad. The great powers at the Cairo and Potsdam conferences also all allowed Korea to be independent in a "due course." When Japan surrendered, the Korean people celebrated the arrival of the days of liberation and independence, but unexpectedly, as a result of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, not only was the desire for Korean independence not realized, but Korea was still occupied by American and Soviet troops, with the 38th parallel as the dividing line, and it was impossible to seek reunification between the North and South. How can the Korean people not be disappointed? Not heartbroken? Therefore, the United States does not understand the wishes of the Korean people, does not fulfill its past promises to allow Korean independence, does not help the Korean people to achieve independence and unity, but instead adopts a policy of splitting Korea; this is indeed a major mistake in the US policy toward Korea.

Second, the division of North and South Korea is also a fatal blow to the Korean economy because South Korea is the agricultural area of Korea, and North Korea is the industrial area of Korea. Only when the North and South are unified, cooperate with each other, and exchange what they have, can the Korean economy be revived. Otherwise, the livelihood of the Korean people cannot be solved. Therefore, the Korean people yearn for the unification of the North and South, in addition to political factors, there are also economic factors. However, the US policy toward Korea neither respects the wishes of the Korean people nor takes into account the economic conditions of Korea, how can it win the support of the Korean people! Although we do not know the general situation of the actions taken by the Soviet Union in North Korea, the Soviet Union is always encouraging the Korean people to strive for unity and solidarity, and is always trying to improve the economic life of the Korean people. Compared with the two, the United States will naturally only fail in Korea.

Third, the current US policy of supporting the revival of Japan is also a major reason why the US military rule in South Korea has lost popular support. Korean residents in Japan are still being abused and oppressed by the Japanese government. In the eyes of the Korean people, this is always the result of the US supporting Japan and suppressing Korea. At the same time, seeing Japan's increasingly prosperous revival makes the Korean people even more afraid of being re-ruled by Japan. Moreover, in South Korea, most of the police who maintain order are police from the Japanese era, and the psychology of hostility still exists, thus creating a psychology of anti-Japanese and anti-American sentiment among the Korean people. Therefore, riots continue to occur in South Korea, and the reason lies in this.

The above is worth deep reflection by the US authorities. It is now time for the United States to change its policy toward Korea. If the United States does not start by winning over the hearts and minds of the Korean people and insists on going its own way, the separate election in South Korea on May 10th may cause unexpected waves and lead to the explosion of the Eastern powder keg! We hope that the US government and the public can face up to the Korean crisis.

### The Board of Directors of the Four-Bank Joint Administration Approves an Increase of 1 Trillion in Salt Loans; The Huangpu Port Construction Loan is Also Approved

[Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 6th] The 364th meeting of the Board of Directors of the Four-Bank Joint Administration was held on the morning of the 6th. Yu Hongjun served as acting chairman, and all directors attended. Important cases were approved as follows:

(1) Increase in Salt Production Loans: The total amount of salt loans for this year had been approved by the 360th meeting of the Board of Directors as 300 billion yuan for production loans and 700 billion yuan for marketing loans. Now, due to the increase in salt production costs, the Board of Directors approved an increase of 1 trillion yuan in production loans today, bringing the total to 1.3 trillion yuan, including the previously approved 300 billion yuan. As for the originally approved marketing loans, each bank will handle them independently according to the business loan method.

(2) Approval of the Huangpu Port Construction Loan: Huangpu Port construction is an important project in the Father of the Nation's industrial plan.
