### The Executive Yuan Will Not Propose Reconsideration of the Budget; Ordinary Departments Will Publish It Immediately; The Special Budget Will Remain a Closely Guarded Secret

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Revenue and Expenditure General Budget Bill for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic [1948], after being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan and sent to the Executive Yuan, was discussed at the Executive Yuan's extraordinary meeting on the 31st. It was unanimously deemed to be generally sound, and the Executive Yuan has replied to the Legislative Yuan that it does not intend to propose reconsideration. It is learned that the Legislative Yuan, upon receiving the reply, will promptly publish the entirety of the ordinary portion of the budget. However, the special budget will remain a closely guarded secret.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Within the general budget for the second half of the 37th year, there was an item for housing construction costs amounting to three trillion yuan. The allocation method for this sum has been drafted by the Executive Yuan and agreed upon by the secretaries-general of the other four Yuan. It has now been finalized and will soon be discussed at an Executive Yuan meeting. Key points are as follows: (1) The allocation of construction funds is limited to the dormitories of personnel of the five Yuan and their directly subordinate ministries and commissions. The construction of dormitories needed by other agencies will be planned and handled separately in the future. (2) The allocated amount will be calculated based on the proportional standard of the number of personnel in each agency who have reported that they do not yet have dormitories. (3) According to the above scope, there are more than 8,000 personnel in the five Yuan and various ministries and commissions who do not yet have dormitories, with an average allocation of more than 370 million yuan per person. (4) Strive for consistency in construction methods and standards. As this method has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan, the construction of dormitories for personnel of various agencies still remains to be seen. However, the construction costs for Legislative Yuan dormitories, totaling 1.8 trillion yuan, have already been approved by the Executive Yuan. This amount is nearly two-thirds of the total construction costs for dormitories for personnel of the five Yuan, while the dormitory construction costs for Legislative Yuan personnel are still covered within the 3 trillion yuan.

Committee members generally advocated that state-owned enterprises should reduce staff and expenditures, and that the profit figures should be increased. Therefore, it was retained and the Executive Yuan was requested to supplement the relevant data on the operating revenue and expenditure of each institution for reference. Now that the Executive Yuan's documents have arrived, the Budget Committee will begin to re-examine them. The meeting on the 2nd will first decide the review procedure and the candidates for the initial review committee. The meeting place will be the Chairman's Reception Room of the National Assembly Hall. A reporter visited various locations on the upper floor of the National Assembly Hall on the 1st.

### Editorial: How to Attract Foreign Exchange Funds

Although the "Measures for Overseas Chinese Capital and Funds of Nationals Abroad to Apply for Investment in Domestic Production Enterprises" have been promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the implementing rules are still under review by the authorities. Therefore, in fact, this new measure to attract foreign exchange funds has not yet been implemented. This newspaper has previously made suggestions on improving overseas remittances. Therefore, regarding this new measure, how to attract foreign exchange funds, we would like to further offer some opinions for the reference of the relevant authorities.

First, we must point out that those who possess foreign exchange are one group of people, while those who are willing to start businesses are another group. Capitalists and entrepreneurs, in fact, often cannot be lumped together. Just look at those customers in the stock exchange, flipping long and short, changing in an instant, and you can see a glimpse of the psychology of the wealthy. Moreover, much of the overseas Chinese capital is earned through hard work, and is remitted in small amounts to support families in their home country. How many of them have the desire and ability to return to China to start businesses? Now, Articles 8, 9, and 10 of the Measures stipulate that the return of overseas Chinese capital must be premised on establishing or expanding businesses, and that the goods brought back to China, except for a portion that may be resold, and the proceeds from the sale must be deposited in designated banks and used in accordance with the approved production plan. So, how can that overseas Chinese capital be smoothly guided back to China? The most difficult thing to understand is that the identity of the owner of the overseas Chinese capital must be certified in writing by the local embassy or consulate and must be reviewed and approved by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission before being allowed to proceed according to the above articles. Is the government afraid that someone will impersonate overseas Chinese to remit money back to China?

Second, we believe that the new measures impose too strict restrictions on applications for the import of funds from nationals abroad, which may not be enough to attract foreign exchange funds. For example:

(1) It must be certified by the local bank where the deposit is made that it was deposited before June 30, 1948. If the local bank refuses to certify, why not allow it to be invested back in China? Is it afraid that there are other entanglements that will involve the government? Isn't the whole country now shouting about borrowing or requisitioning these funds? These funds have not yet flowed back, and the government has already attached conditions, clearly indicating restrictions. What exactly is the intention? Or is it afraid that too much will flow back? Also, why must deposits after June 30, 1948 be prohibited from returning? Is it afraid that someone will engage in currency arbitrage, or secretly evade funds abroad first, and then invest them back through this channel? We believe that the evasion of funds should be prevented. If pre-emptive prevention fails, and the funds can automatically flow back into the country legally afterward, it seems that they should be welcomed. Why is it necessary to prohibit them again?

(2) The production equipment that must be imported must be for the applicant's own use, and the raw materials that the business must import must be for the applicant's own use, not exceeding six months of production needs. These regulations are intended to strictly limit the overseas funds of nationals, allowing them to only be used for their own purposes when applying to bring goods back to China, not allowing them to be transferred to others, and limiting the quantity, not allowing them to be arbitrarily increased. The intent of the latter restriction is to crack down on hoarding, whether this is necessary is not discussed for the time being. What needs to be discussed is, as mentioned above, that wealthy people may not necessarily be involved in production, especially in running factories, and those who can run production and factories may not necessarily have funds deposited abroad. Why limit them to self-ownership and self-use, and not allow them to borrow freely? If they are allowed to borrow freely, what harm will it cause to the country? What harm will it cause to both parties? Currently, most factories in China, except for a very few that are solely owned, are started as joint ventures or are funded on an ad hoc basis. For what reason is this common practice not applicable to this type of fund and the factories they run? Isn't it being touted that foreign investment is welcome to come to China to start industries? For this type of foreign investment, whether it is sole proprietorship, joint venture, self-owned, or other-owned, it seems that there are no strict restrictions. The Import Management Committee has clearly stated that it will consider it separately. Why must it be stipulated that funds from nationals abroad must be used by themselves and absolutely not allowed to be transferred?

(3) The applicant shall report the progress of the project and the use and storage of imported equipment, materials, and raw materials in writing on a monthly basis, and may send personnel to inspect it when necessary. This clause is a solemn inspection to prevent private resale, which seems to be beyond reproach. However, other equipment, materials, and raw materials imported with foreign exchange do not seem to have this type of condition. Why is it necessary to take special precautions against those imported with funds from nationals abroad? Does this batch of imported goods contain unexpected dangers? Or is it ostensibly welcoming and attracting, but in reality still wary of too much import?

(4) If there is any resale for profit, the applicant and the import merchant acting as agent shall be subject to the penalty of permanent suspension of raw material quota allocation and permanent prohibition from applying to import any goods. This is also a common article in trade control. However, this penalty should apply equally to all other foreign orders to be fair. If imported goods ordered with other foreign exchange, or even imported goods obtained from quota allocation, can be openly resold for profit, and the applicant and the import merchant are not responsible in any way, but the items imported with self-owned overseas funds are subject to such strict restrictions, this is inevitably partial, and there is nothing to commend.

In short, in this autumn of extremely depleted foreign exchange funds, for all overseas Chinese capital and funds of nationals abroad, in principle, it seems that they are welcome to come, and should not be completely rejected. Bringing goods back to the country, starting factories on their own, using them for their own purposes, or transferring them, as long as they apply according to the law and obtain permission, it seems that they can all be accommodated, without setting up too many restrictions. The current measures have too many obstacles, equivalent to deeply closing the door, making it impossible for them to flow in, so that these funds flow into the black market or escape to Hong Kong. This time, in desperation, a new chapter has been established, originally to attract foreign exchange funds that are self-supplied. Why be so rigidly bound to the point of investing in factories, still blocking them outside the door, making it a phenomenon that can be hoped for but not obtained? Some people think that Chinese laws do not need to be seen as rigid, as long as there is a line of road that can be connected, merchants will not worry about having the skill of grafting one thing onto another for coordination. We have seen the prosperity of smuggling and the rampant black market for foreign exchange in recent years. This speculation may indeed be a way of natural adjustment in the future. However, who is doing it, and who is making it happen? Knowing that law enforcement is difficult, but striving for strict legislation, one cannot help but sigh in regret.

### Unsmooth Transportation of Grain for Price Stabilization; Changsha Price Stabilization Association Concludes

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 1st] Changsha City began price stabilization in February, benefiting more than 126,000 poor people and stabilizing social order.

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 1st] Taiwan Province is preparing to issue water conservancy bonds totaling 13.9 billion NT dollars. This amount is needed for the water conservancy budget for this year, but the provincial government's total budget is only 14.2 billion yuan, resulting in an approved water conservancy budget of only 180 million yuan, which cannot be sustained. Therefore, the decision to issue bonds has been made, and the Water Conservancy Bureau has carefully drafted a plan. According to Director Zhang Xishou, these bonds will not be offered for public sale, but will be allocated at a price to individuals who directly benefit from water conservancy.

All certificate fee income will be allocated to the townships for household administration purposes.

### Central Government Values Yellow River Dikes; Dong Biwu's Absurd Remarks Intend to Shift Blame; Spokesperson of the Ministry of Water Resources Refutes Specifically

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The communist bandit Dong Biwu recently, under the guise of his so-called "Chairman of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association," broadcast absurd remarks to Mr. Hoskins, President of the World Friends Service Committee China Service, and Mr. Leonard, the American Red Cross Representative in China, falsely accusing the central government of obstructing the Yellow River flood control project, resulting in the imminent breach of the south bank of the Yellow River. This is a fabrication of facts, a reversal of right and wrong, and a confusion of public opinion. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Water Resources specifically refutes this as follows: The dikes of the lower Yellow River are related to the safety of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. The central government has always attached great importance to them. At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, the Yellow River closure and dike restoration project was listed as the primary task of post-war reconstruction and actively promoted. Despite the communist bandits' repeated obstruction and sabotage, the closure project was finally completed in March 1947. However, the dike restoration part could not be carried out in coordination with the closure project due to the communist bandits' obstruction. At that time, the river returned to its old course, and the flood season was imminent. The situation was urgent, the work was difficult, and the crisis was hidden. The central government immediately intensified construction on the sections of the dike controlled by the national army, including the areas in Henan and Hebei provinces, the southwest bank of Shandong, and the sections on both banks between Qihe and Jiyang near Jinan in central Shandong. In June of last year, through liaison and mediation, a mixed committee was organized by the central government, the communist bandits, and the United Relief Agency to discuss how to prevent military operations from affecting the dike restoration and repair project. While the meeting was in progress, Liu Bocheng's troops suddenly crossed the river in large numbers from Dongkou on June 30th, roaming around, capturing, and killing our dike repair workers, forcing the dike repair work in southern Hebei and western Shandong to come to a standstill. The mixed committee also came to an end because the communist bandits had no sincerity in negotiating. Later, when Liu's main force fled south to the Dabie Mountain area, the order along the river was roughly restored, and our workers were able to return to work and continue to engage in repair and defense. Fortunately, it was safe during the flood season. In December, the communist bandits occupied Dongming and Lanfeng, and all the dike sections on the southwest bank of Shandong were abandoned. Since the communist bandits occupied this section of the river dike, they not only did not repair or protect the dikes but also engaged in planned destruction. From Tongwaxiang to Linpuji, the top of the dike was generally excavated into southern trenches several feet wide and several feet deep. The materials, grain, and housing along the dike were also mostly destroyed. In May of this year, the national army in southern Hebei and western Shandong advanced, and our dike repair workers had just returned to the defense with the army to start work, but Chen Yi's troops of the communist bandits crossed the river south from Dongkou again on June 2nd. Our workers had no choice but to leave a part of the flood team technicians disguised as guards, and the rest retreated with the army again. In late June, Kaifeng was once again captured. The communist bandits burned the entire Yellow River Conservancy Engineering Bureau to the ground. All kinds of instruments, materials, furniture, and automobiles were burned or looted, and none were spared. The Henan and Hebei repair offices also suffered heavy losses. The equipment of the various work sections and brick factories below Kaifeng in Henan Province was looted. The new work that was not completed this spring was also destroyed. Their hostility to the dikes and the people along the river is obvious. Recently, the Gao Village in Dongming, Hebei Province, encountered danger, and the situation was critical. Since the area has been occupied by bandits, only a few workers have been disguised as guards. They used the existing bricks to repair the breach, but the top of the breach was heavily impacted by the rapid current, and the situation is still extremely dangerous. The Yellow River Conservancy Engineering Bureau has instructed the Hebei Repair Office to send personnel to repair the breach with the army. This matter is the duty of the government and is related to the safety of the local people. We have always tried our best to do it. Although we have been repeatedly disturbed by bandits, our workers still risk their lives, do not fear difficulties, and work desperately. A total of 33 people were captured by communist bandits in 1946, 5 were killed, and 23 were missing. In 1947, 13 people were captured by communist bandits, 41 were killed, 44 were missing, and 4 were injured. This year, 1 person was captured, 6 were killed, 163 were missing, and 2 were injured. However, the bandit Dong falsely accused the central government of obstructing the flood control project from Dongming to Juancheng in the border area between Hebei and Shandong provinces on the south bank of the Yellow River and near Jinan, saying that it was on the verge of breaching. This is a reversal of black and white and not worth refuting. However, what should be brought to the attention of Chinese and foreign people is that the communist bandits first obstructed the closure of the breach in various ways, and now they deliberately destroy the dike restoration. On June 30th last year, Liu's crossing of the river, and Chen's crossing of the river on June 2nd this year, the first to be disturbed were the river workers. Who is the culprit is obvious to all. Now, taking advantage of the arrival of the flood season, they suddenly shoot arrows without a target and counterattack the central government. Looking at their intentions, it is clear that they have a conspiracy to create an artificial breach, prevaricate and shift the blame to the central government. Their sinister tricks are to cover up the truth. We sincerely hope that Chinese and foreign people will not be misled by these chaotic remarks of the communist bandits, and we hope that the communist bandits will arouse their conscience and prioritize the lives and property of the people, abandon this poisonous plan, and withdraw from the area occupied on the south bank of the Yellow River, so that our local government and water conservancy agencies can carry out the repair and defense work with a free hand. We are confident that we can prevent floods. Otherwise, once the flood arrives, if a breach occurs, all responsibility should be borne entirely by the communist bandits.

### Molotov Shortens Vacation; Meets Separately with Three Special Envoys; Contact Begins to Resolve East-West Disputes

[This newspaper dispatch] London, 1st Broadcast: After the envoys of the United States, Britain, and France unexpectedly met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the evening of the 31st, they met at Smith's residence today in high spirits and exchanged views on everyone's impressions of meeting Molotov. The three envoys briefly presented the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France to resolve East-West disputes to Mr. Molotov. It is expected that there will be no new developments in the consultations between the Western countries and the Soviet Union on the issues of Germany and Berlin before the beginning of next week. The Soviet Union will carefully consider the replies of the envoys of the United States, Britain, and France.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 31st United Press] Molotov shortened his vacation today, returned to the Foreign Ministry from his summer villa outside Moscow, and held consultations with the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France on the crisis between the East and West in Germany. Mr. Molotov successively met with the American Ambassador Smith, the British Foreign Secretary Bevin's private secretary Roberts, and the French Ambassador Chatenet, and talked with each person for about 30 minutes. Each person informed the Soviet Foreign Minister of their government's attitude towards the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin and reviewed the entire German situation. Prior to this, the representatives of the three countries met with Foreign Deputy Zorin, who represented Molotov, last night and expressed their desire to fully discuss the Berlin issue with the highest Soviet officials. Zorin conveyed this intention to Molotov, who decided to personally meet with the representatives of the three countries.

[United Press, London, 1st] Well-informed political figures said on the 1st that the showdown between the East and West blocs over the Berlin blockade does not necessarily lead to a new world war, but the Allies must prepare for war to back up their diplomatic offensive against the Soviet Union and prevent the Soviet Union from dominating Germany alone. It is reported that many influential officials in the United States are absolutely pessimistic, believing that discussing the resolution of the German issue with the Soviet Union is like seeking skin from a tiger. They believe that if the Western countries do not have a showdown, they will not be able to break the German deadlock. It is also reported that many experts say that although the showdown will not happen immediately, it will eventually be realized one day. They are pessimistic about the entire German situation, especially the "new strategy" of negotiating with the Kremlin. They believe that the Soviet Union's conditions are too harsh, and it is impossible to reach an "agreement" by talking with the Soviet Union.

At the same time, news from Moscow said that the American and French ambassadors, the British special envoy, and the diplomatic cadres of the three countries are discussing the next step on the Berlin issue. Officials said that all news about the progress of the negotiations should be issued from the capitals of the three countries. Americans in London believe that the East-West agreement on Germany is hopeless and point out that the control of Germany is in a desperate situation. Other countries in Europe have all chosen the good and followed. The Soviet Union completely controls East Germany. If the Soviet Union agrees with the West, it should slightly relax its dominance in its occupied area. The Western Allies completely control West Germany and are currently planning to establish a West German government in Frankfurt to link it with the Marshall Plan and the Western European Union. Agreeing with the Soviet Union is tantamount to abandoning West Germany, making it threatened by Soviet occupation.

### Berlin Situation Shows No Improvement; US Reaffirms Decision to Remain; People Mourn American Airlift Personnel Who Died

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 31st] General Clay, Commander of the US Forces in Germany, declared at a press conference today: Since the Warsaw Conference, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the German issue has not changed. The situation in Berlin has neither improved nor deteriorated, and the opportunity for a peaceful resolution remains the same as before. "We have decided to remain in Berlin, but we hope that the problem can be resolved peacefully." Clay stressed that the Berlin airlift must continue to be maintained and even strengthened if necessary. Referring to the crisis of the Berlin municipal government, Clay said: He is not dissatisfied with the current Berlin municipal government. The municipal government may tend to split only under Soviet pressure. Clay concluded by saying that he is prepared to negotiate with the Soviet side on the unification of the Berlin monetary system.

[This newspaper dispatch] London, 1st Broadcast from Berlin: 3,000 people in Berlin stood in the scorching sun to hold a memorial service to mourn the five American air force personnel who died while performing airlift duties after the blockade of Berlin. Speakers condemned the blockade of Berlin as inhumane and praised the martyred delivery personnel as "heroes who helped us resist the new dictatorship."

### Guarantee World Peace; US Has Determination; Truman Broadcast Address

[Central News Agency, New York, 31st] President Truman, speaking to the nation today on the completion of the new international airport in New York, said that the performance of the US Air Force today is sufficient to prove the determination of the United States to maintain a strong military force in order to protect the peace of the land. He reviewed the Air Force, and a battery fired 21 guns in salute. Mr. Truman said that the new airport is a sign that the American people have confidence in lasting peace, and therefore the construction of this airport assumes that air travel and commerce can develop in large quantities and gradually increase in importance. However, world peace cannot be easily obtained. The American people must work hard to complete the necessary conditions for peace, namely confidence, mutual trust, and understanding. Among them, confidence is the most important. Before the emergence of a world of freedom for all, there must be confidence. As for mutual trust and understanding, the United States is willing to fully exchange information with its friendly countries and hopes that there can be the highest degree of freedom in international travel and transportation. The United States will firmly support the United Nations and try to restore the world's confidence.

The Italian people want a republican constitution that guarantees peace, freedom, and work. The evil forces that previously supported and fostered fascism and war are now secretly plotting to expand their power. They do not want to respect civil rights and collectivism. The Italians should think of saving themselves from being enslaved, just as before." The committee said: To assist and protect anyone in need, because "the association has the will and is about to have the means to achieve its goals."

### Former White House Advisor and Former Finance Minister; Involved in US Spy Network; Spy Miss 指指 Provides Information to Soviet Union

[United Press, Washington, 31st] Miss Bentley, who claimed to have been a communist spy, testified on the 31st that the former White House advisor and the former finance minister were two of the many government officials who leaked secret information to the Soviet Union. Miss Ban voluntarily abandoned her spy work in 1945 and surrendered herself to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and made a public statement to the House of Representatives Non-American Activities Committee on the 31st.

Miss Ban admitted that Corey, a former advisor to the late President Roosevelt and the current President Truman, leaked information to Miss Ban through an intermediary that the United States had "translated" the Soviet code in 1944. This made the Soviet Union "very excited." Corey was also once the late President Roosevelt's personal representative to China. Miss Ban also admitted that former Finance Minister Whit, another official who provided information, delivered the information to the Soviet Union through Miss Ban. Miss Bentley did not immediately explain what information Mr. Whit provided. Mr. Whit joined the Treasury Department in September 1934 and was promoted to Finance Minister in 1945. He had served as an official in the International Monetary Fund. In addition to admitting that Mr. Corey leaked the translation of the Soviet code, Mr. Corey also reported the "internal disputes" of the Chinese situation at that time. Miss Ban emphasized that Kerry was not a Communist, but he did provide information. Mr. Corey's information was usually given to railway worker Schaufman, who passed it on to War Economics Bureau official Schauf Master, who then passed it on to Miss Ban. Regarding Mr. Whit, Miss Ban admitted that she did not know whether he was also a Communist. Miss Ban also admitted the names of the large and small officials in the government who provided information. When asked whether these officials knew the meaning of providing information, Miss Ban replied that she could guarantee "Corey must know where the information was going."

Corey Denies Giving Passwords

[United Press, New York, 31st] Corey, the former administrative advisor to the late President Roosevelt and the current President Truman, said on the 31st that he had never known the name of Miss Bentley. Corey issued a statement saying: "To the best of my knowledge, I have never had any direct or indirect contact with a communist or a communist agent. I have never met Miss Bentley, nor do I know her name. My personal work has never involved military codes, so I could never have provided any information about the code to anyone."

[United Press, New York, 31st] Kerry, who served as the administrative advisor to the late President Roosevelt and the current President Truman, visited China as President Roosevelt's personal representative and returned to the White House in January 1945 to serve as the President's administrative advisor. Mr. Corey also led an economic delegation to Switzerland to persuade Switzerland to stop most of its wartime trade with Germany.

[United Press, Washington, 31st] Congressman Ruskin, a member of the Non-American Activities Committee of the House of Representatives, said on the 31st that he was dissatisfied that the committee spent so much time discussing the "humiliation of Corey." Mr. Ruskin said: He did not know why the committee could believe the third-rate information of a former Communist like Bentley. He thought what Ban Tela said might be a lie, but Ban Tela said: Whether what she said is true or not can be decided by the committee.

Whit Doesn't Know Spy Miss

[United Press, Washington, 31st] Former Treasury Undersecretary Whit denied on the 31st that he had provided confidential government information to anyone who might provide it to Moscow. Mr. Whit called from New York and said: He had never heard of the name Miss Bentley, and he asked the House of Representatives Non-American Activities Committee to allow him to testify in order to "refute this涨涨."

[United Press, Washington, 31st] House of Representatives Non-American Activities Committee Chairman Ferguson said on the 31st that the committee would allow Remington, an economic expert from the Department of Commerce, to meet with Ms. Bentley to confront her in person. Remington was also one of the officials accused by Miss Ban of providing her with information. Remington said: He provided news to Bentley because he recognized her as a journalist, and the news "can be provided to researchers who know how to use newspapers well."

### Rumor North Korea Arrests Anti-Communists

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 1st] It was recently learned that the US military authorities stationed in South Korea declared: "The North Korean authorities recently arrested a large number of anti-communists and believers in democracy, numbering as many as 50,000 people, most of whom were sent to Sakhalin Island, and the Soviet military authorities advertised that the treatment of these "people who should be influenced" would definitely not be bad".

### Preparations for the Danube River Convention; Austria is Excluded from Participating; France Demands to Maintain Freedom of Navigation; Intense Debate with Soviet Representative

[Central News Agency, Belgrade, 31st United Press] The Soviet bloc countries today unanimously rejected Austria's participation in the preparation of the new Danube River Convention. The Danube River Conference today passed (with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France abstaining) Vishinsky's motion, that Austria only has the power to request inquiries at the conference. According to prior arrangements, US Ambassador Casey suggested that the country can fully participate in the work of the conference and have the right to vote. This suggestion was rejected by seven votes to three (France abstaining).

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 31st] Today's Danube River Conference is characterized by the fact that the French representative demanded to maintain the rights enjoyed by France in the former Danube River Convention. The French and Soviet representatives had a fierce debate over this. This morning, the chairman of the French delegation, French Ambassador Teevenly, declared at the meeting that France cannot be bound by any new convention that disregards previous rights. Without prior agreement from all parties concerned, no majority can cancel the existing regulations. Then, Austrian representative Rosenberg stood up and stated that Austria has the full right to participate in the meeting and must not only attend as a qualified consultant. The demands of the French and Austrian representatives were supported by the delegations of the United Kingdom and the United States, but the other countries opposed them. Czech Clementis, Romanian Booker, Hungarian Molnar, and Bulgarian Kamenov all stated that France's request was tantamount to taking advantage of the rights it has obtained, intending to maintain them, and that these special rights were all obtained by imperialist powers at the expense of the legitimate interests and natural rights and sovereignty of the small countries on the Danube River. However, the Romanian Foreign Minister admitted that the French people have special interests on the Danube River and hoped that this could be understood. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky debated with the French representative for an hour with stern words. Mr. Vishinsky once said, "We will never accept Aimee Dayton. The door is still open for you to enter and leave. There are no Benelux countries here, only sovereign and equal countries." Mr. Vishinsky then spoke eloquently, stating that the 1921 Danube River Treaty no longer exists because it has been repeatedly changed and violated by the signatory countries. Finally, he said that the new Danube River Convention must be passed by a majority of countries and implemented according to the will of the majority of countries. The minority countries can only abide by the decisions of the majority of countries.

### Su Suggests Limiting Japan's War Potential

Talks with Soviet Representative at the Economic and Social Council

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 31st, United Press] The Soviet representative told the United Nations Economic and Social Council today that the Soviet Union agrees to the development of Japan's peacetime industry, but Japan's war potential should be limited.

The United Nations Headquarters received a telegram from Geneva today reporting on the meeting situation.

### Britain closely watches the political situation in Hungary and Poland, the Hungarian President is succeeded by Szakasits, the Soviet Union intensifies its control over Eastern European satellite states

[Agence France-Presse, London, 31st] The British Foreign Office expects to receive reports from British Minister to Hungary, Helm, regarding the reasons for the resignation of Hungarian President Tildy, and from Ambassador to Poland, Gainar, regarding the current situation in Poland. The Foreign Office is particularly eager to learn about the rumors of the arrest of Polish Deputy Prime Minister Gomułka. According to sources here, this development is a sign that the Soviet Union is currently trying to eliminate politically suspicious elements in countries within its sphere of influence.

[United Press, Budapest, 1st] Hungarian party leaders met on the 1st and unanimously supported the chairman of the United Workers' Party, Szakasits, to succeed Tildy as president. The communique stated that the arrest warrant for Tildy's son-in-law, Sonoki, has not yet been issued, and government officials are still keeping this a secret. It is reported that Szakasits was promoted to president as a reward for his contribution to the merger of the Social Democratic Party into the Communist Party or the United Workers' Party.

[United Press, Washington, 1st] Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, who has been in exile since the coup last May, declared on the 1st that the purge of non-communist leaders by Eastern European communist parties indicates that the Soviet Union is ordering its satellite states to prepare for war against the West. He also stated that President Tildy was "undoubtedly" ousted by the Communist Party, just like Beneš of Czechoslovakia. "Obviously, the Soviet Union intends to implement a new diplomatic policy, according to which important political positions in Eastern Europe should be managed by loyal communists. This new diplomatic policy is to prepare for war against democratic countries and the United States."

### New York International Airport Completed, US Air Force Holds Grand Performance, 850 Aircraft of Various Types Participate, Truman and Dewey Inspect in Person

[Central News Agency, New York, 31st] An unprecedented strategic formation of American vehicular aircraft was inspected today at the newly completed international airport in New York City by President Truman, New York Governor Dewey, and New Jersey Governor Driscoll. Today's air show was truly a spectacle of the era. 850 aircraft, from jet fighters to super bombers and troop transport aircraft, roared overhead in the most spectacular formation, revealing to the world the restored air power of the United States.

Today's air power, a grand performance in peacetime, was held for the official opening of New York International Airport. The new airport covers an area of ​​5,000 acres, cost $240 million, and took six years to build. From now on, it can accommodate 1,000 aircraft takeoffs and landings per day, and transport 10 million passengers per year. Today is New York City's anniversary, and the opening ceremony of this huge airport was specially held today, and the International Aviation Exhibition, which details the situation of this aviation century, also started today. The exhibition will last for nine days. The US Navy also participated in the military performance today, with hundreds of naval aircraft performing attack and defense battles, the situation is very realistic and vivid. The British Air Force and Navy also participated in the performance as separate units. In addition to Truman, Dewey, and Driscoll, there were also senior Chinese officials on the review stand. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia were neither invited nor participated, which has attracted much attention. The US official explanation for this matter is that at the recent air show held in Moscow, the Soviet government did not invite the United States to participate, so the United States did not invite the Soviet Union and its vassal states this time. Today's grand performance of American air power, on the one hand, was strengthened by Truman's participation, and on the other hand, it was held during the Berlin crisis, and countries around the world will not ignore its significance.

### Krupp Armaments Factory Owner Sentenced to Twelve Years in Prison

[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 31st] German steel magnate Krupp von Bohlen was found guilty today by the Third US Military Tribunal of harming humanity, sentenced to twelve years in prison, and all his property was confiscated. Other accomplices convicted included Losse, manager of the Essen factory, sentenced to seven years in prison, Johnson, who succeeded Losse as manager of the metal factory in 1943, sentenced to ten years in prison, steel expert Muller sentenced to twelve years in prison, Inn, assistant to Johnson and Minister of War Production Eberhardt, sentenced to nine years in prison, and secret police liaison von Blow sentenced to twenty months and nineteen days. The only person acquitted was Schech, Eberhardt's predecessor. Judge Anderson said during the trial that Krupp treated the French cruelly during the war, and in fact used prisoners of war and exiles as slaves in the factory. He also mentioned that 520 Hungarian Jews were abused, and only two survived. Qualified circles here said that the confiscation of Krupp's property included many huge armaments factories. According to reliable sources, the verdict was decided by a two-to-one vote, and Krupp's lawyers opposed the confiscation of Krupp's property.

### Siamese House of Representatives Schedules Discussion on Excluding Overseas Chinese Immigration Case, If the Entire Case is Passed, it Will Be Equivalent to Banning Foreigners from Entering the Country

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 1st] Siamese Lieutenant General Luan Jiao Song recently adopted the view of a Siamese junior officer currently in the United States, and sent letters to all members of parliament, advocating that the number of overseas Chinese entering the country each year should be reduced to 20. Luan said in the letter: A large number of foreigners have recently immigrated to Siam, and soon the Siamese people will lose all opportunities to make a living, leaving only skin and bones.

Luan also cited the United States as an example, saying: "When I considered this issue, I received a letter from a junior officer stationed in the United States, saying that the area of the United States is twelve times that of Siam, but the number of overseas Chinese allowed to enter the country each year is only 105. At the same time, the United States also hopes that China will support its democratic ideas. According to this ratio, Siam should set the limit to 20, and the limit for Western people should also be the same." Former Siamese Prime Minister and leader of the Democratic Party, Nai Baiyabaiheng, said: Luan compared Siam with the United States, I don't know what the intention is. It is reported that Congressman Nai Soli once suggested in the House of Representatives to limit the number of foreigners entering the country to 2,000 per year. The House of Representatives may discuss this case on the 5th, so Luan took the opportunity to put forward this proposal. Nai Soli's reason for proposing the amendment is that the Siamese people are not as diligent as foreigners, so this is used as a demonstration, but what Luan advocates is almost a ban on foreigners entering the country.

### Looking at British Politics

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in London, Sabengeng

(1)

The Labour Party is now in power in Britain. The Labour Party's main policy, in terms of politics, is to recognize British-style democracy, and believes that the current parliamentary system can lead Britain into a socialist country. In terms of economy, it advocates that the state should operate various large enterprises under the principle of "compensation". Because of the former point, it has a great difference from the Soviet Communist Party, because the Soviet Communist Party or Soviet-style communism, in theory, worships the Marxist-Leninist class struggle theory, although some people believe that according to Marxism, the realization of a socialist society does not necessarily have to adopt violent revolution (such as Kautsky's statement), but this is not recognized by today's Communist Party.

In practice, in recent years, communists in various countries, although also advocating democracy, or claiming to be democrats, but here arises a problem of interpretation of terms. Having read Lenin's "State and Revolution", the content of the old and new constitutions of the Soviet Union and the process of their amendments, and paying attention to the actual actions of the communist parties in various countries in recent years, it can be known that the Communist Party's democracy is different from British-style democracy. Because of its economic policy, it is also different from the United States. The capitalist economic system first originated in Britain with the industrial revolution, but today, the representative of the capitalist economic system should be the United States rather than Britain. No matter what stage capitalism has developed to today, it still unconditionally worships the "private property system" and "freedom of enterprise". Anyone who unconditionally worships the "private property system" cannot, whether "compensated" or "uncompensated", be able to receive private enterprises by the state. Anyone who unconditionally worships "freedom of enterprise" cannot talk about government control over enterprises. These make Britain different from the United States, although the British Labour Party still recognizes the existence of the private property system. Naturally, in terms of economy, although the Labour Party's policy is different from that of the United States, it is also different from the Communist Party. The Communist Party's transformation of the social economy is carried out in a much more radical way than the Labour Party. The Communist Party will never be in the mood to sit in Parliament and slowly discuss which enterprises should be nationalized and which enterprises do not need to be nationalized. If they are nationalized, what is the method of reception? In this way, we can say that the Labour Party is a political party with a very strong "intermediate" nature. It advocates transforming society without resorting to violence.

(2)

The British Labour Party has been established for about fifty years. The current Labour government is based on the victory of the 1945 general election. On the surface, this is the third Labour government in Britain. The first was from 1923 to 1924, and the second was from 1929 to 1931. However, neither of these two Labour governments were able to occupy more than half of the seats in Parliament, but were established with the assistance of the Liberal Party. Therefore, it was not only "short-lived", but also could not fully adopt its own policies in fact. Since 1931, although the Labour Party has also participated in the government, it cannot be said to be in power. In the 1945 election, the Labour Party won more than half of the seats in Parliament. It is in power. A pure Labour government has a majority of seats in Parliament. It is the first time in British history. According to the Parliament Act of 1911, the British Parliament has a term of five years. Therefore, unless there are special circumstances that make the Labour government feel that it is necessary to dissolve Parliament and appeal to the voters, or there is a serious division within the Labour Party, the Labour Party will have five years to implement its policies. Counting from now, there is still more than a year.

What has the Labour Party done since it came to power? Perhaps it is the Labour Party's misfortune, perhaps it is the Labour Party's great fortune, that it has a chance to perform. Although the Labour government was established after the victory of the war against Germany, it encountered a serious economic panic in Britain. The reason for this panic has been latent for a long time. The war consumed Britain's national wealth, especially overseas assets, making it impossible to make up for the trade deficit caused by the import of food and raw materials. Britain is the birthplace of the industrial revolution, which has enabled Britain to take a step ahead of other countries in some respects, and has made it occupy some advantages in modern history. It is also because it is the birthplace of the industrial revolution, and the industrialization was too early, which has made it suffer a lot in some aspects today. The people's living standards have been raised too high, and it is not easy to shrink even if the country is poor today. Some transportation and production machinery are too old and outdated, and the war has caused greater consumption. Now, "reforming" requires a lot of capital, but not reforming will affect efficiency, which directly and indirectly affects production. In the past two years, the Labour government has been fighting a life-and-death battle with economic panic, apart from international issues. Since last summer, the suspension of convertibility of the pound and the reduction of food rations have really indicated that the problem has reached its peak.

But the Labour Party still has achievements. In addition to calling on people to tighten their belts and work hard to produce, the Labour Party has been continuously carrying out nationalization policies. The Bank of England, coal mines, electricity, important transportation, gas industry, etc. have all been nationalized. In terms of politics, the reform of the House of Lords and the proposal to abolish the plural voting system in the House of Commons are all underway. But the common people are the most realistic. Perhaps it is due to the failure of the local elections last year that the Labour Party has become wary, and it must do something realistic to win the votes in the next election. Perhaps it is due to the Labour Party's own policies. The budget bill for this year proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Parliament in April is a wonderful performance of the Labour Party's policies. It has revised the income tax system, which has benefited the middle class a lot, and it has implemented a "special donation" to reduce the concentration of wealth. The Labour Party is a moderate socialist. Any moderate socialist political party must maintain the existence of the middle class and cannot turn society into an extreme state of "either Yang or Mo". "Extremism" is contradictory to "moderation". The Labour Party probably sees this clearly. Therefore, the Labour Party's politics, while respecting the interests and opinions of the "trade unions", also protects the middle class. I don't think this should only be interpreted as striving for the next election votes, but should be regarded as a basic attitude. The current situation is also beginning to improve in terms of economy. The Marshall Plan has allowed the Labour Party to breathe a sigh of relief, and Britain's production has also made progress. There was still a coal shortage last spring. This spring, not only is there no coal shortage, but it has also begun to be exported.

(3)

But will the Labour Party's administration in Britain be smooth sailing? But it is not.

First, as mentioned above, the Labour Party is a political party with a very strong intermediate nature, and the middle road is the most difficult to walk. The left can criticize you for being conservative, and the right can scold you for being radical. And, no matter how you maintain the middle road, there is no "scale" to measure for you. Therefore, political parties with a strong intermediate nature are most prone to internal strife or division. As far as we know, regarding British foreign policy, whether it should cooperate with the United States, cooperate with the Soviet Union, or stand between the two major powers, the Labour Party has not seen a completely unified view internally. Also, whether the steel industry should be immediately nationalized has also caused controversy within the Labour Party. The partial reshuffle of the cabinet last October is said to be related to party issues. Recently, Italy held a general election. It is clear that the Labour Party's basic attitude is to hope that the current government will win. However, on the eve of the election, some members of Parliament belonging to the Labour Party sent a telegram to the Socialist Party, which opposed the government and cooperated with the Communist Party, wishing it final victory. This issue involved the issue of party discipline and caused a stir for several days. These kinds of things may still happen. This is not a question of whether the Labour Party itself is healthy, but it is due to the nature of the Labour Party. How to overcome this possible internal divergence of opinion is a problem.

Second, in order to realize its主張, and to win the voters in the next election, the Labour Party will naturally engage in some reforms. Every reform may encounter resistance, and this resistance may be getting bigger and bigger. According to rumors, the nationalization of the steel industry should have started long ago, but because it directly infringes on the interests of powerful people, the Labour Party cannot help but hesitate. Also, the proposed public medical system, which seems to us to be very good, has encountered resistance from doctors. The recent new budget has also been greatly criticized by conservatives. Undoubtedly, there is still a lot of resistance that the Labour Party's policies may encounter. Although Britain's social structure is different from that of the United States, it is still an old-fashioned capitalist country. These forces resisting reform must be carefully considered.

Third, as mentioned above, Britain is currently experiencing an economic panic. This panic makes it difficult for the government to show results to the people in order to win votes. And because of the panic, it cannot help but rely on US economic assistance. In this way, in foreign or domestic affairs, it may be directly or indirectly affected by the United States. Whether the British Labour Party admits it or not, this influence is likely to hinder or delay British reform, and it is not easy to avoid from the perspective of outsiders.

Due to the above, we cannot but think that there are some difficulties in the future of the Labour Party. Of course, on the other hand, there are also some things to be optimistic about. The British industrial revolution and the establishment of democratic politics have both gone through a process of gradual evolution without bloodshed. Everything in Britain seems to be developing, growing, rather than being manufactured. It can peacefully complete the establishment of a democratic system, and it can naturally peacefully establish a socialist society. The success or failure of this experiment is directly related to the welfare of the British people, and indirectly affects the whole world. Judging from the current situation, although success or failure is unknown, even if the Conservative Party comes to power again, it may not be able to turn Britain into what it was before. Is it possible to change the nationalized industry back to private ownership? The political future of Britain is still optimistic, assuming that the Labour Party can insist on implementing its policies. (July 2)

### Public Utilities Make Astonishing Demands, Requesting Price Increases of Four to Six Times, Public Utilities Bureau is Negotiating Loans to Reduce Costs, Eight New Prices Expected to be Announced Tomorrow

The various public utility companies in this city submitted the percentage of price increases they requested for this month to the Public Utilities Bureau the night before last (May 31). According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, who told reporters: This time, the various companies requested extremely high prices because they suffered too much losses last month, and the exchange settlement certificate rose again to 4.55 million yuan last week. The telephone increase is six times, the electricity increase is four times, the water increase is five times, the gas increase is four and a half times, and the transportation increase is four times. They also stated that the price adjustment should be calculated according to the formula and should not be forcibly suppressed. The old and new dividends of the company can be ignored, but the cash income and expenditure must be balanced. The Bureau believes that the company's request is too high and the general public cannot afford it. It will do its best to negotiate loans with the Central Bank to ensure that fuel can be settled in foreign exchange as soon as possible at the beginning of the month, so that oil prices can be stabilized, which can reduce costs. According to Zhao, the new prices of the eight major public utilities, including water, electricity, gas, telephone, buses, trams, ferries, and small trains, for this month, will be announced tomorrow (3rd) as much as possible, and they will be allowed to collect retroactively from the 1st.

Also, regarding the number of public utility loans, the Public Utilities Bureau will negotiate with the Central Bank again today, and it is expected to be resolved.

### Business and Industry Express Concern About the August First-Period Index

After the issuance of large denomination banknotes, prices were relatively stable due to the proper handling by the Central Bank and relevant authorities, allowing July to pass peacefully. However, the general business and industrial community believes that there is little reason for optimism regarding the various factors in August. They generally believe that the increase in the price of rationed rice and the price increases in public utilities and transportation are likely to drive up prices. The cost of rationed rice and public utilities both affect the cost-of-living index for the first half of the month, which will increase the burden on factories and shops. When the time comes to pay wages, it will become the biggest problem. In addition, purchasing power has generally decreased due to high prices, and sales of goods are sluggish due to inconvenient transportation in various places. Therefore, the authorities should quickly adopt effective measures to prevent price increases. Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable, and the important industries of Shanghai should also be quickly protected to avoid facing a severe crisis.

### National Goods Promotion Speech Competition Finals: Six Children in Two Groups Win Awards

[Our Newspaper's Report] The "National Goods Promotion Children's Speech Competition," jointly organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Association and the Shanghai Municipal School Teachers' Welfare Promotion Association, was held at the National Goods Exhibition Hall yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Chairman Cao Zhigong delivered an opening speech, stating, "This Association and the Municipal Education Welfare Promotion Association jointly organize the National Goods Promotion Children's Speech Competition to promote national goods. Outstanding children will be given prizes by the factories of the members of this Association to encourage them, so that all children can understand national goods, promote national goods, and then love and use national goods."

### Announcement of Rationed Rice Prices: Retail Market Sees New High Prices; Emergency Measures to Be Taken; Efforts to Open Supply Lines

Following the announcement of this month's rationed rice prices, the market price of rice yesterday broke through new highs again. The retail market price reached as high as 50 million yuan. The municipal authorities are paying close attention to this situation. In order to curb the rising rice prices, emergency measures will be taken when the North and South markets open today. With the new grain entering the market, the rice supply being plentiful, and the continued distribution of household rice, the rise in rice prices is clearly artificial. Therefore, severe blows will be dealt to speculators and hoarders who only care about their own private interests.

On the other hand, the promotion of both ordinary rationed rice and subsidized rationed rice in August is being actively pursued. It is reported that the Ministry of Food has now formulated an effective plan to completely stabilize rice prices for the Shanghai food rice problem. Together with the municipal government and the Civil Regulation Committee, they will decide to use a large amount of funds in the short term to purchase large quantities of food rice from rice-producing areas abroad, such as Siam, Saigon, Brazil, etc., and from domestic rice-producing areas, such as Suzhou, Wuxi, etc., when the new grain enters the market, so that the distribution work for October, November, and December can continue to be maintained.

### Impoverished People Should Postpone Buying Rice Until Subsidized Certificates Are Received

According to the Civil Regulation Committee, in order to avoid abuses in this distribution of subsidized rice for impoverished people, it is specifically stipulated that the subsidized rice certificate for impoverished people must be used in conjunction with the per capita ration certificate in order to be valid. As the investigation and registration of impoverished people are still under review, in order to prevent impoverished households from buying household rice beforehand, which would render the subsidized rice certificate ineffective, in addition to notifying each Baotianzhang (local official) to inform each household, it is hoped that citizens will pay attention. All households listed in the register of impoverished households should postpone purchasing per capita rationed rice. Their per capita ration certificate must be used in conjunction with the subsidized rice certificate for impoverished people after it is issued, so as not to render the subsidized rice certificate ineffective.

### Counterfeit Currency Operation Cracked Down in Haining; Suspects to Be Sent to Shanghai

According to reports received by the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command, a large-scale counterfeit currency operation has been cracked down in Mamuxiang, Haining County, Zhejiang Province, which forged a large number of 5,000 yuan customs gold notes. All the suspects have been arrested. It is rumored that the case involves a wide range of people, so they will be sent to the relevant authorities in this city for interrogation within days. The printing of the counterfeit currency is blurry, especially the image of Sun Yat-sen. The words "5,000 Yuan Customs Gold" are also relatively crude, and the "制" (manufactured) character in "Central Mint" is even more muddled. It is rumored that some of the counterfeit currency has been used in Shanghai, so citizens are urged to pay close attention.

### The Second Phase of Charity Housing Lottery Tickets: Cannot Be Issued for the Time Being

Can Only Be Realized After Prices Stabilize

Regarding the issuance of the second phase of charity housing lottery tickets, according to reports obtained by reporters, it is still being prepared by the Housing Charity Lottery Department of the Shanghai Relief Committee. The issue of the land base for building the houses was previously resolved by the department after responsible surveys of two locations in Nanshi and Zhabei. However, because the land purchase group (Land Administration Bureau) has not yet negotiated the price of the land, it is impossible to build. At the same time, land owners often regard the land as a hot commodity and are unwilling to sell it due to recent price fluctuations that are too intense. However, Mayor Wu is still striving to promote this work, because this is the only way to solve the housing shortage in this city. Mr. Wu also hopes that all parties involved in preparing the charity houses will sincerely and quickly cooperate. It is rumored that the issuance date of the second phase of charity housing lottery tickets will only be realized after prices stabilize somewhat.

The design of this terminal building was created by many of the most prestigious mechanical and architectural experts in the country, including the technical personnel who built the Chengdu Airport during the war.

### The Quality of Milk Is Far Inferior to the Past: Health Authorities Are Strictly Managing; Samples Are Taken Every Morning

[Our Newspaper's Report] Before the war, when the milk parlors in this city were managed by the Public Works Department, they were divided into ATT, A, and B levels based on their equipment and quality. There were a total of 28 parlors with 1,946 dairy cows, producing 36,042 pounds of milk per day. Among them, the four ATT-level parlors had the cleanest dairy cows and the most reliable products. The authorities' management and inspection of each parlor were extremely strict. After the war, the districts in the suburbs were merged into the municipal government, and the inspection and management of milk were all handled by the Health Bureau. In addition to the levels still being divided into the three levels before the war, the milk parlors in Nanshi and Pudong had no disinfection equipment, so they were all classified as C-level. According to last year's statistics, there were a total of 65 milk parlors in the city, of which 47 were C-level alone. Although the number of dairy cows has increased by about one time compared to pre-war, with 3,756 cows, the daily milk production is only 39,262 pounds. The Health Bureau's funding is tight, and its manpower is insufficient, so the management and inspection have not been able to exert their maximum function. Therefore, apart from a few foreign merchant ranches and a small number of Chinese ranches, which have excellent disinfection equipment, so users can rest assured to order and drink, the rest are inevitably somewhat wary. The rules for inspecting milk parlors recently formulated by the Health Bureau are extremely strict, such as dairy cows, milk, livestock, milk parlors, environment, milking, and bottling. At the same time, personnel are dispatched every morning to intercept milk deliverers along the way and take milk for sampling. From January to May of this year, a total of 459 samples were taken for bacterial and chemical tests. Among them, 70 were unqualified, and the proportion was still small. However, in one and a half months in June, 85 items were inspected, and as many as 32 were unqualified. Now that summer is approaching, drinkers of milk should pay attention. Bacteria in milk can still be safe if boiled, but the most feared is that the milk contains tuberculosis bacteria, which is extremely dangerous for infants to drink. As for the number of dairy cows with tuberculosis in this city, there are still no formal statistics. It is hoped that the health authorities will conduct a comprehensive inspection, strictly crack down on sick cows, and provide a safety guarantee for citizens who drink milk.

### Expanding Inspection of Unclean Food and Drink: A Cleanliness Supervision Team Will Be Organized

The Municipal Health Bureau believes that with the arrival of summer and hot weather, the health of citizens is extremely important. In order to ensure the health of citizens in summer and to better prevent unclean drinks, in addition to organizing a street cold drink patrol team to regularly inspect and strictly crack down on unclean cold drinks, it has now been decided to organize a cleanliness supervision team to expand the scope of inspection of all unclean foods and drinks. In addition to stalls, all restaurants and cold drink shops will also be strictly inspected. It is rumored that the captain of the team has decided to be held concurrently by Yang Mingding, director of the bureau.

### Cooperative Enterprise Inspection Team: A Review Meeting Will Be Held Today

The attending units are the Municipal Council, the China Farmers Bank, the Central Cooperative Treasury, the Cooperative Enterprise Supply and Sales Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union. According to Zou Jinxi, the head of the Cooperative Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, to reporters yesterday: "The inspection team inspected more than 300 cooperative units of various types this time, and the overall results are in line with the standards. The inspection team also plans to select a small number of units with the best results as model cooperative societies, which will be supported by the financial and material institutions of this city in the future. At least a small number of non-standard units will be dissolved after review at today's meeting."

### The Gold Banknote Case of a Stateless Person: Involving People from Fifteen Countries; Evidence Includes U.S. Dollars, Diamonds, U.S. Military Identification Cards, Etc.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The stateless person Hans' Obrenz was arrested and interrogated by the Jingjing Brigade of the Police Bureau on the 21st of last month on suspicion of running a black market in gold banknotes, and was transferred to the Special Criminal Court for handling a few days ago. According to police sources, the black market in gold banknotes run by Obrenz involves people from as many as fifteen countries. Earlier, the police bureau received a confidential report about Obrenz in April of this year and immediately began to monitor Obrenz. After the confidential report was found to be true after interrogation, the Jingjing Brigade began to act at 10:00 AM on the 20th of last month, searched Obrenz's residence, and arrested Obrenz. The police bureau immediately questioned Obrenz based on the seized items. Obrenz directly admitted to running a black market in gold banknotes and various illegal acts. The police bureau then summoned several people involved based on Obrenz's confession, and obtained many clues about their illegal acts. However, some of the people involved in the case are temporarily or permanently residing abroad, and their whereabouts are temporarily unknown. However, the Jingjing Brigade stated that it would never give up the investigation, and would take action as soon as possible. The main points of the situation of the various cases committed by Obrenz are explored and recorded as follows:

Three Cases Involving Debt Disputes

The first case involves Felix Gilbert and Kctzmann. The former is now in Australia, and the latter's whereabouts are unknown. When the scholar was in Shanghai, Obrenz borrowed $1,000 USD from him, but he soon repaid it. Later, he borrowed another $1,000 USD from Jill, and as a result, he returned Jill's principal of $220 USD and interest of $721 USD. Later, Jill went to Australia and transferred the debt to Gao Zi. Obrenz admitted that he had repaid the difference in the old debt with U.S. dollars, but because there was a separate agreement with Gao, he only paid $100 USD.

The second case involves Landan and Frenkl, both of whom are currently in Australia. He admitted that he had paid 50 U.S. dollars to the Way (Frank's representative) in order to repay his debts. The third case involves a Mrs. Trude Neumann, which is a dispute over a legal currency debt.

U.S. Dollar Check Returned for Insufficient Funds

The fourth case involves the illegal sale of foreign currency checks. Obrenz purchased a U.S. dollar check for 200 yuan from a Swedish shipowner named Bryer and resold it to an American pilot. After the pilot sent the check to the United States for cashing, it was returned due to insufficient funds. The fifth case also involves two foreigners. The document is a debt list issued by a Swiss bank on May 21 of this year.

The sixth case also involves two foreigners. A man named Ave intends to borrow $3,000 USD from Obrenz and agrees to pay a monthly interest of $525 USD. Obrenz obtained a loan from another foreigner named Pi, but stated that Obrenz should receive a commission of $125 USD out of the $525 USD monthly interest.

The seventh case involves three foreigners, one of whom is now in Beiping and is also a pilot. The case is complicated and involves $1,000 USD.

The eighth case has not yet obtained physical evidence from the police bureau. However, Obrenz admitted that on the 19th of last month, he exchanged 50 U.S. dollars for a foreign Mrs. Qi at the black market price.

One Gold Pound from the Street

In the ninth case, the police bureau seized a gold pound and 688 U.S. dollars. He admitted that they were purchased from various people on the street, but the names were unknown.

In the tenth case, Obrenz was found to be in possession of the identity cards of two U.S. soldiers. Since the people involved in the case are under the jurisdiction of U.S. military regulations, the police bureau has transferred the case to the U.S. military intelligence department for investigation, but has not yet received a reply.

The eleventh case involves three diamonds and two foreigners. Although there is a lack of physical evidence in the case, Obrenz has admitted that the first diamond was purchased from a Chinese employee of a commercial bank. The diamond was priced in U.S. dollars, and the payment was made in yuan at the current U.S. dollar value. The second diamond was purchased from a German Jewish refugee living in Hongkou for 300 U.S. dollars. The third diamond was purchased with legal currency. Obrenz later sold one diamond to Culltsust for 920 U.S. dollars, and another diamond was priced at 350 U.S. dollars and sold to another Jewish refugee.

According to the police bureau, in the above eleven cases, except for the third and tenth cases, which do not constitute criminal acts, Obrenz has admitted that he has committed as many as nine crimes in a short period of eight months, and he should be punished according to the law.

### The Fourth Father's Day: Extensive Publicity and Preparatory Commemoration

August 8th marks the fourth Father's Day commemoration. The Promotion Committee, starting in early July, held a series of subcommittee meetings to discuss the proceedings. It was decided that, in addition to the publicity plan and commemorative ceremony being handled as usual, 88 prominent figures from all walks of life would be newly appointed as promotion committee members. The remaining work plan is as follows:

(1) Promoting the student aid campaign: This fundamental task should continue to be actively carried out. On the one hand, members of the association will donate funds to support students.

According to regulations, children should wear red flowers (white flowers for deceased fathers) to pay their respects to their fathers and offer gifts. For fathers traveling far away, send a family letter to wish them good health. The goal is to deeply instill this filial piety festival in people's hearts, to encourage good customs, promote public welfare, and strive to serve the society and the country, in accordance with the broad sense of filial piety.

### Impersonating an Inspector to Extort Money: Dockyard Manager on Trial

Zhao Tiejun from Nantong, 34 years old, manages water transport affairs at the No. 4 dock on the Bund in this city. Last month, Cheng Yuren, a quartermaster from the Haimen County Self-Defense Corps, came to Shanghai to purchase 50 bags of military rice, but without a permit, it was piled up on the dock, making it impossible to ship. Zhao Tiejun, seeing this situation and thinking he could take advantage of it, impersonated an officer from the Garrison Headquarters Inspectorate and extorted 50 million yuan from him. Of this, 20 million yuan was for transportation costs, and the rest was pocketed by Zhao. Unexpectedly, after Cheng returned to Haimen, he reported this to the county government, which in turn requested the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters to investigate. Zhao was arrested and transferred to the court for trial. The case was publicly tried in the Eighth Criminal Court by Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court the day before yesterday. According to the defendant's confession, he only took 20 million yuan from Cheng at the time. Of this, 10 million yuan was for transportation costs, 5 million yuan for water transport fees, 3 million yuan for tips for the coolies and cigarette money, and another 2 million yuan for the sailors' drinking money, and he himself did not receive a single penny. As a result, the court decided to reschedule the case for further verification.

### Hardship of Life Leads to More Crimes: Chief Prosecutor Says the Consequences are Worrisome; Wang Zhibin's Case Will Be Handled According to Law

Cha Liangjian, the Chief Prosecutor of the District Court, met with reporters yesterday and pointed out that with the current soaring prices and economic difficulties, the number of criminal cases in the city is gradually increasing, and the consequences are worrying. He said: Judicial officers observe with a fair eye during trials. Among theft offenders, there are fewer evil people, and most are good people who are forced by the hardships of life to take risks, resulting in legal sanctions. Their criminal behavior is unforgivable under the law, but their situation is indeed pitiful, as exemplified by the case of Wu Chao. Cha firmly believes that after the government stabilizes the economy and people's lives become stable, criminal cases will definitely decrease. He continued that judges are like doctors. When treating patients, they must hope that their condition improves. When judges are trying criminals, they also use their sense of justice to advise criminals to repent and start anew. Cha pays close attention to the discipline of the three detention centers under the court's jurisdiction, often visiting them around 9:00 PM to inspect whether there are any negligence of duty or illegal activities, and sometimes interrogating prisoners to inquire about their life in prison and whether they have been wronged. Cha also told reporters that among the criminal cases recently handled by the court, there are more theft and opium addiction cases, while civil debt lawsuits have been greatly reduced. He hopes that the media will strengthen publicity about the consequences of opium addiction, emphasize the importance of eradicating opium, in order to eliminate it. Cha stated that the case of Wang Zhibin, a legislator of the Democratic Socialist Party, who was recently accepted by the court for drug trafficking, will be handled according to law, and the police and the court are currently investigating the case.

### Learning to Swim: Two Children Tragically Drowned

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at around 3:30 PM, two children drowned in the pond of the Guanghua Coal Depot at No. 585 Guangfu Road, Zhabei. The children were Zhu, 12 years old, residing at Xisiwenli (No. 222) of Binnan Da Avenue, and Ruan Jinde, 16 years old, residing at No. 286 in the same neighborhood. The two children went to the pond yesterday to learn to swim, but because they did not know how to swim, they tragically drowned after entering the water and died instantly. They were then discovered by someone who tried to retrieve their bodies. The Zhabei Branch Bureau, which is only a wall away, dispatched Officer Wang Shusheng and police officers to investigate upon hearing the news and transported the bodies to the autopsy station on Changde Road. According to an employee of the coal depot, the factory was originally occupied by the Japanese during the enemy-puppet period and operated as a steel factory. The air-raid shelter built by them covers an area of about two or three acres. Over time, it filled with stagnant water to a depth of more than ten feet, transforming into a pond. Today, coincidentally, was the day for distributing rationed coal briquettes, and the gate was open, which led to this unfortunate event.

### Murderer in Guangxi Road Case Arrested in Yuyao and Escorted to Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] At around 6:35 AM on the 8th of last month, in the back厢房 on the second floor of No. 16, Lane 297, Guangxi Road, the three tenants Lai Guoqing and his wife, Lai Zhang Yinji, were fast asleep when Li Renjin (also known as Li Wu, from Jiangbei), who lived with them, broke into the room, holding a sharp knife, and stabbed Lai Guoqing in the vital parts of his abdomen, killing him instantly. Lai's wife, Zhang Yinji, was also cut twice on her arm, and the blood flowed non-stop. The murderer then fled. Afterwards, officers Song Shaomei, Police Chief Liu Zutong, and Li Junkun rushed to investigate and took Li Saiwang, his third younger sister, and his friend Yang Yinshan to the bureau for interrogation and launched a search in all directions, but to no avail. On the 26th of last month, the branch bureau received a tip that Li Renjin was hiding in the home of his sister-in-law, Xu Xiaomei, in the棚户 in East Yuhang Road, Baoding Road. They then sent officers to bring Xu in for questioning. According to her statement, Li Renjin, looking disheveled, did go to her home on the 11th and asked to borrow some travel expenses, saying that someone had introduced him as a conscript for one hundred million yuan to be sent to the Changshu County Government. Upon learning of this, the branch bureau sent officials to Changshu, submitted a letter to the county government, requesting their assistance. After investigating for three days, they found nothing. The officer in charge returned to Shanghai. On the 29th, they received a telegram from the Changshu County Government, stating that Li Renjin, the murderer in the Guangxi Road blood case, had fled to Changshu after the incident and enlisted as a volunteer soldier in Lucun Town, was recommended to join the camp of the Ninth Regiment of the 保送, and had been captured in Zhitang. They could immediately send officers to escort him back for handling. After receiving the telegram, the bureau chief Zhao selected officials to go to Changshu and escorted him back to Shanghai on the 30th to be investigated. It is understood that the reason for stabbing Lai Guoqing to death was to rob him of his gold ring, gold watch and other ornaments.

### Joint Power Plant: Unrealized Date; Reportedly After Investigation by the U.S. Aid Representative, Interest in This Plan is Reduced

[Our Newspaper] The Sino-American Joint Power Company's plan originally occupied an important position in the U.S. aid construction special fund. The U.S. side planned to invest 20 million U.S. dollars to complete this plan in five years, so that the city would never be short of electricity in the future and to prepare for future industrial expansion. However, it has recently been reported that after the U.S. aid delegation came to Shanghai for investigation, they believed that according to the current electricity price calculation standard in China, existing power plants will not be able to maintain, let alone expand and build new plants, so they are no longer interested in the original joint power company plan. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter interviewed relevant senior personnel yesterday. According to them, whether the joint power company's plan will be implemented is still under discussion. The opinions within the Stillman investigation team on this matter are not consistent, but Stillman himself advocates the implementation of this plan. The decision-making power in this matter is actually in the hands of the U.S. government. The decision will be made when Stillman completes his debriefing in the U.S. and comes to China again. It is heard that the U.S. Aid Operations Association has another plan to solve the power shortage, which is to increase the power generation capacity of existing power plants, because the joint power plant will take five years to succeed, and the power cannot be increased during this period, so there is a feeling that it is too late to help. However, the largest power company here still has confidence in realizing the ideal of a joint power plant and believes that the electricity price issue will be reasonably resolved by the Chinese government sooner or later. It is also learned that Shen Xirui, Secretary-General of the U.S. Aid Operations Association, said: The U.S. is dissatisfied with the excessively low electricity prices, but has not heard of any negativity towards the joint power plant plan.

### Family Suffers Tragedy at the Hands of Bandits: Mother, Son, and Wife Slaughtered; Anhui Civil Servant Deeply Affected, Swallows Vaccine to Seek Death, Rescued

Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, a middle-aged man suddenly snatched a vaccine at the Anti-Epidemic Injection Station stationed at the North Railway Station, poured it into his stomach, and attempted to commit suicide. The nurse discovered it and quickly snatched it away. Half a bottle of vaccine had already been swallowed. The road police urgently sent him to the Railway Hospital for an enema. By 6:00 PM, he was out of danger. The man's name is Zhu Mingjian, an employee of the Anhui Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, originally from Taixing, Jiangsu. Recently, his 86-year-old mother, wife, and one son and one daughter were too deeply stimulated by the Communist bandits in Taixing. In his resentment, he suddenly developed the thought of death.

### Vehicles Without Replaced Uniform License Plates are Prohibited from Traveling in the City Starting Today

The Public Utilities Bureau's handling of the replacement of uniform license plates was originally scheduled to end at the end of June. However, due to various reasons, such as some vehicle owners leaving Shanghai, repairs being underway, inconsistent seals, and address changes, they failed to apply as scheduled. Therefore, after discussion by the bureau, it was approved to be extended to the end of July. It is now learned that the overdue application for license plate replacement for the vehicles has been officially closed. The bureau specifically announced that from today, all large and small vehicles (trucks, passenger cars, motorcycles) with Guo and Hu license plates that have not replaced their uniform license plates, except for test vehicle license plates, as well as vehicles from other cities with Guo and Hu license plates, are prohibited from traveling in the city.

### Weekly Forum: On This Year's Budget for the Second Half (Continued from Yesterday)

— Zhang Baiyi

I believe that the government today already possesses two major sources of revenue: one is the four billion US dollars in American aid, and the other is state-owned property (including American surplus materials, lend-lease materials, enemy and puppet industries, and Japanese reparations). These already provide the prerequisites for currency reform. The government today may as well base the exchange rate between the new currency and the legal tender (fapi) on the recent price of four million times (that is, approximately the current market price of silver dollars), i.e., four million fapi exchanged for one new currency unit. At this time, the government can issue 250 million yuan of the new currency, which can recover all the fapi. In this way, the people will regain confidence in the currency, and the remaining currency income will still be deposited in banks. The banks can then restore their original banking functions, thereby controlling the people's purchasing power and having sufficient funds to finance agricultural and industrial production. Once the fapi is completely withdrawn, the government may as well announce that the Central Bank is completely independent from the Ministry of Finance. The agency business of the national treasury can still be entrusted to the Central Bank, but the Central Bank will no longer be obligated to provide advances for the national treasury. After the Central Bank is independent, if the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank discovers that the national treasury deposits are insufficient, it can request the Ministry of Finance to issue new public bonds or mortgage materials to make up for the shortage. After the Central Bank is independent, the credit of the exchange coupons issued by the Central Bank can increase a thousandfold to ten thousandfold. After the currency credit is established, it can also restore the credit of the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance can smoothly sell public bonds or short-term treasury bills. However, according to my calculations, it is not necessary to issue public bonds in the second half of this year.

The issuance of 250 million yuan of the new currency can certainly recover all the fapi, but the issuance of 250 million yuan of the new currency will of course still be insufficient for the entire market. If you want to increase it to the pre-war level of 1.4 billion yuan, wouldn't it become disguised inflation? But the fact is not so. When the new currency restores currency credit, the value of gold, US dollars, foreign currencies, silver dollars, rice, and other "physical currencies" circulating on the black market today, which replace the status of fapi, will all be lost. The original circulation space of these "physical currencies" will be occupied by the new currency. For example, urban housing leases will no longer use gold and US dollars as payment tools, and rural areas will also stop using rice and silver dollars as payment tools. The issuance needs caused by the new currency occupying the circulation space of a physical currency will definitely not affect prices, so the value of the new currency itself will not be depreciated as a result.

After the currency system reform, the budget calculation unit will be changed to the new currency. The draft budget that I have proposed is as follows:

Draft National Budget for the Second Half of the 37th Year (Unit: New Currency Yuan) Revenue Section

1. Tax Revenue 250,000,000
2. Loan Revenue 500,000,000
3. State-Owned Property Revenue 1,162,500,000
    (1) Income from the Sale of US Surplus Materials and Lend-Lease Materials 75,000,000
    (2) Income from the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Property Materials 25,000,000
    (3) Income from the Sale of Japanese Reparations Materials 3,500,000
    (4) Income from the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises 800,000,000
    (5) Profit Income from State-Owned Enterprises 250,000,000

Total Revenue 1,93,500,000

Expenditure Section

1. Military and Police Expenditure 875,000,000
2. Economic Construction Expenditure 625,000,000
3. Other Government Affairs Expenditure 43,000,000

Total Expenditure 1,93,500,000

The tax revenue of 250 million yuan is far lower than before the war. According to the report of the Ministry of Finance, the tax revenue in the 25th year of the Republic of China (actual receipt by the national treasury) reached 1.057 billion yuan, and the administrative and business revenue reached 36 million yuan. Among the tax revenue, customs duties accounted for 636 million yuan, salt tax accounted for 247 million yuan, and consolidated tax accounted for 131 million yuan. Therefore, the 250 million yuan that I have set is not excessive for the burden capacity of industry and commerce. The loan income is based on the American aid loan that has already been signed, with 250 million US dollars converted into 500 million new currency yuan based on the current free exchange rate and domestic prices, i.e., two new currency yuan are equal to one US dollar. Because the US dollar has also experienced inflation during the war, increasing from 6 billion yuan before the war to about 28 billion yuan today, it has actually increased by three and a half times, but because the production volume of American materials has also increased, it is not excessive to have two new currency yuan to one US dollar.

However, what deserves special attention here is the issue of China's internal debt repayment. This internal debt includes all fapi public bonds, customs gold bonds, US dollar public bonds, pound public bonds, and US dollar treasury bills issued domestically. If these public bonds are all repaid with their principal and interest in the new currency, the national treasury will definitely not have this burden capacity. If you want to reluctantly maintain creditworthiness, you can only promote financial bankruptcy. However, if currency system reform is not implemented due to difficulties in repaying debts, the disadvantages are as mentioned above. All things must have both advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of policy should be determined by comparing the advantages and disadvantages. I believe that the government can only handle this public debt in a separate case. Reforming the currency system is the only way to improve finances, so reforming the currency system is all beneficial and without harm. Even if there are disadvantages due to debt repayment problems, the degree of harm is much lighter than the harm of not reforming the currency system. Moreover, if the currency system is not changed, the losses of public bond holders have already become a fait accompli, so currency system reform is a necessary and urgent measure. I suggest that there are two principles for the treatment of public bonds after the currency system reform, and one can be chosen: one is to freeze all domestic public bonds and implement an indefinite suspension of principal and interest payments, and resume payments when the finances and national treasury have the capacity to pay principal and interest; the other is to implement a public bond exchange system, in which all domestic public bonds are uniformly exchanged for new unified public bonds, including gold public bonds. Exchange new currency-denominated public bonds according to the original actual price of various public bonds and then give a uniform discount. The repayment period is also extended to the next four or fifty years or even a hundred years. This issue is very important and the government must be careful about it.

The government also needs to reform the tax collection technology. Not all tax collectors in the tax administration system are necessarily corrupt, but observing the recent emergence of corruption cases in various tax agencies, we must pay special attention to it. Although the government has established an audit system for this matter, established a public treasury system, and the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance also has a roving audit facility, corruption cases are still prevalent. We must know that if tax collectors collude with taxpayers, they may reduce the national treasury's tax revenue by more than half. I have previously proposed that the government establish a unified industrial and commercial tax, similar to a tax-farming system, in which local industrial and commercial groups directly pay to local treasury banks. This method can not only increase the national treasury's tax revenue, but also facilitate industry and commerce, and save the government a considerable amount of tax collection expenditure. I believe that the types of taxes that can be changed to a unified industrial and commercial tax include industrial and commercial income tax, business income tax, industrial and commercial salary and remuneration income tax, securities deposit income tax, property sale income tax, property lease income tax, excessive profits tax during extraordinary periods, business tax, goods export tax, mining tax, and goods tax on cotton yarn tax, wheat flour tax, cement tax, liquor tax, beverage tax, sugar tax, tea leaf tax, bamboo and wood tax, fur tax, porcelain tax, paper foil tax, match tax, cigarette tax, etc. Goods suppression taxes can all be abolished and completely merged into the unified industrial and commercial tax, and local industrial and commercial groups agree with the Ministry of Finance on an amount and collect it in four seasons. For example, in Shanghai, it is assumed that the unified industrial and commercial tax is currently 200 trillion yuan per year in legal tender, and then the industrial and commercial groups will determine a certain amount and the industrial and commercial groups will separately notify each factory and store to recognize and pay. If this method is implemented, it is believed that the industrial and commercial sector will also welcome it.

Before selling state-owned property, it is necessary to consider whether the financial policy is self-contradictory. For example, today the government is planning to sell enemy and puppet industries, surplus materials, lend-lease materials, and Japanese reparations materials, but at the same time, it is planning to levy property taxes. The government plans to levy property taxes in order to increase tax revenue and reduce inflation, which seems quite reasonable in principle; but you must know that at a time when capital is constantly flowing out and factories and exporters are moving in large numbers to special areas such as Hong Kong, if you want to levy property taxes again, it will inevitably promote their courage to escape overseas. At the same time, if you want to levy property taxes and sell state-owned property, I would like to ask who is more willing to buy state-owned property if they have funds? Increasing tax revenue to make up for deficits is the foundation of sound finance, but it must also be considered from an economic point of view whether it has disadvantages. If the degree of its disadvantages affects the tax source and the entire national economy and people's livelihood, it must be avoided. Moreover, at present, there is no problem with the source of wealth, so the property tax levy case seems to be abandoned. Moreover, the property tax is a tax levied on the tax rate, unless it is absolutely necessary, can it be tried tentatively.

However, currency system reform also takes a considerable amount of time, and it is by no means possible to do it all at once. However, if the financial budget is to be sound, it must be changed to the new currency unit immediately. In this gradual process, I believe that this problem can be solved by the following methods. That is, the budget for the second half of this year should be calculated immediately in new currency units, but it will not be announced immediately. At the same time, before the currency system is reformed, the government should issue a currency system reform reserve savings certificate, denominated in one tael of gold, priced at 150 million to 300 million yuan per tael, interest-free, with a period of one year, and an issuance volume of one million to five million taels, and the principal will be transferred to one tael of gold or a new currency equivalent to one tael of gold upon maturity. The issuance of this currency system reform reserve savings certificate can prove the government's determination to reform the currency system within a certain period of time, and it can also guarantee that the value of those who purchase savings certificates with legal tender will be absolutely maintained. If the government takes this opportunity to absorb trillions of yuan of legal tender, it can control the people's purchasing power of trillions of yuan of legal tender, so that the people's purchasing power no longer flows to the market space of US dollars, legal tender, foreign exchange, gold, silver dollars, and goods, thereby promoting the balance of prices and the stability of the currency, and the currency system reform can be carried out smoothly. Some say that if the government does not have this gold to repay the principal at that time, problems will inevitably occur, but because there is a new currency to repay the principal, this problem can be solved satisfactorily. The purpose of purchasing this gold certificate is to maintain its monetary value. When the value of gold and the new currency is stable at that time, both gold and the new currency will be welcome. For example, when gold deposits were implemented during the war, many people were willing to receive legal tender when they matured, because the price of gold had not changed much at that time.

In short, although my country's finances have gone through eight years of the War of Resistance and three years of suppression of the rebellion, the foundation of finance is quite sound due to the nationalization of a large number of enemy and puppet materials after the end of the War of Resistance, the transformation of a large number of enemy factories into state-owned enterprises, and the acquisition of a large number of reparations materials. In addition, there is also the acquisition of foreign loans, the acquisition of American surplus materials, lend-lease materials, and relief materials, and finance is usually not difficult. In addition, due to the increase in the area of tax collection after the war, the recovery and restoration of production in major factory areas, the income from taxes should also increase. Moreover, due to the restoration of international trade, customs duties cannot be compared with those during the war. It is a strange thing in the world that a victorious country has compensation income and foreign loan income, but it cannot solve its finances, so it still relies on inflation as its main policy?

### Two New Warships: Chongqing and Lingfu

— Our Reporter: Zijian

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, July 29] The two British-donated ships "Chongqing" and "Lingfu," which had been rumored for two months, sailed into Hong Kong, the gateway to southern China, at about 10:00 a.m. on the 28th, after a storm and still in dim weather. Just a few hours after anchoring, the destroyer "Lingfu" was ordered to go to sea to search for a small patrol boat belonging to the Fourth Naval District, which shows how urgent the country needs these two new ships, and it is no wonder that overseas Chinese warmly welcome them and eagerly expect them.

After hearing the news, overseas Chinese rushed to the seaside to watch, but they can only look at the graceful appearance of the new ships published in the newspaper, and they cannot go to the coast to watch, because the new ships are ordered by someone else to be anchored in the Kowloon Bay, outside the urban area, outside the Kai Tak Airport, and it takes more than an hour by electric boat to get there. In the past, foreign warships that sailed into Hong Kong were mostly anchored near the naval dockyard or the sea off Sai Wan, but this time they were led to a cold and quiet bay. When a reporter from a certain newspaper boarded the cruiser "Chongqing" to interview Captain Deng Zhaoxiang, he asked him in a pleading tone whether he could sail the two ships closer to the urban sea so that the overseas Chinese could see them first. He replied, "I have the heart but not the power, please forgive the overseas Chinese"! It turned out that on the way, that is, when the overseas Chinese groups were holding a meeting to prepare for the welcome, he received a notice from the Hong Kong Navy about the location of the anchor when arriving in Hong Kong.

The clothing and equipment of the soldiers on the ship are all British-style, and there is a young man who even grew a beard, looking like an old British sailor. After they heard the speech of Commander Yang of the Fourth Naval District on the ship, some of them were granted leave to go ashore for sightseeing, so the overseas Chinese had a real opportunity to see the heroic appearance of the new navy of the motherland.

The new ships have accepted a five-day reception schedule organized by overseas Chinese groups in Hong Kong, with welcome and expectation combined. If it were not for the fact that the "Lingfu" suffered some mechanical problems due to fighting the storm just before it arrived at the gate of the country and had to be docked for minor repairs, it would have been able to sail into the Huangpu River and meet with the dear compatriots within seven days.

### Bloodshed in Changshu Shazhou District: Two Village Chiefs Brutally Murdered

[Our Changshu Dispatch, July 31] Tao Guifang, the village chief of the 17th village of Fuping Township, has been quite successful in handling conscription and grain collection on weekdays. The weather was very hot the night before, and Tao did not sleep until 10 o'clock. Before long, someone knocked on the door, claiming to be checking the household registration. Tao did not suspect anything and opened the door in his clothes. Four people were guarding outside, and three people rushed in, all holding short guns and shining a strong electric light on Tao's face, making Tao unable to open his eyes. They spoke with a common accent and asked Tao for cash and gold bars. Tao replied that he did not have any at the moment. Unexpectedly, the bandits fired their guns and committed murder, firing a total of four shots. Tao shouted madly and fell to the ground, dying instantly. The bandits fled immediately. The next morning, after receiving the report, the District Procuratorate sent Prosecutor Shen and Inspector Song to the countryside to examine the body. It was confirmed that he died from gunshot wounds, so the family was instructed to collect the body.

### Two Men and One Woman: Wuxi Female Ballad Singer Zhang Lijun Files a Lawsuit, Seemingly Indicating a Love Triangle

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, July 31] Female ballad singer Zhang Lijun was performing "Yang Naiwu" at the Tong Yuchun Book Market in Dahechi, this county. Unexpectedly, late the day before yesterday, she suddenly shouted for help in her room; the next day, she accompanied her father, Shaoquan, to the police station to accuse Zhang Xilin, the young boss of the book market, of attempting rape. Because the mediation failed, she was transferred to the District Procuratorate in the afternoon. According to the testimony: "At about 1:00 a.m., someone broke into Lijun's room, grabbed her eyebrows with one hand, and intended to commit indecent assault. Lijun shouted in a hurry, and only Zhang Xilin was seen in the room when the lights were turned on." Xilin testified that he heard the shouting and rushed to catch the adulterer. At that time, Zhang Yanheng, an employee of the flour shop to the left, was also inside, so the situation was quite tortuous, possibly a love triangle, and the blame was shifted to Jiangdong. As a result of the court hearing, the defendant was released on bail.

### Guiyang City Cracks Down on Underground Banks

[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 1st] Guiyang City is currently cracking down on underground banks. The Criminal Court of the District Court ordered six private banks, including Qianxin, Zhuanghui, and the First Production Cooperative, which were transferred by the Provincial Capital Police Bureau, to cease operations, and the shopkeepers Tan Qian and five others were fined.

It is also learned that Chen Tianxing, the village chief of the Ninth Village of the township, was also shot and killed by bandits. The hunt for the murderer is underway.

### Sun Pusheng Case: Witnesses Subpoenaed, Corpse Coffin to be Transported to Cheng for Examination

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, July 31] In the case of Sun Pusheng, a resident of Baizhangli, Xiyangqiao, Mazhen, being killed, his father, Sun Guanyi, accused the township chief Niu Yusheng of dereliction of duty and murder to the District Court. The District Procuratorate opened a court session for interrogation at 10:00 a.m. on the 31st and ordered the bailiff Lu Dapeng to subpoena the plaintiff Sun Guanyi, the witness Huang Enrong (a member of the Xiyangqiao Council), the former township chief Huang Qichang, and Sun Fusheng and others. The defendant, Mazhen Township Chief Niu Yusheng, the person involved, Chen Xingbao, a member of the Self-Defense Force, and the witness Sun Yaochen (i.e., Jin Da's father) did not arrive. The interrogation was conducted by Prosecutor Zhang Sen. The case involved investigation and was prohibited from being heard by the public. It was only learned that the plaintiff determined that the deceased had no evidence of colluding with bandits and asked what the reason for the killing was, and that torture was used to extract a confession, so he requested to be redressed. The witnesses did not definitively confirm the deceased's suspicion of being a bandit, and they did not witness the killing. The borrowing of rice was a commercial loan from the town office's economic committee to wealthy households and had nothing to do with Sun Pusheng. The interrogation lasted two hours. The court instructed the plaintiff that if the deceased was indeed a bandit and had been killed, the township chief would certainly be in violation of the law, and you would also be difficult to blame. It would be best to settle the matter peacefully. If he is a good citizen who died innocently, he shall be dealt with according to the law, and your son's corpse coffin may be transported to the city within one week for autopsy. The plaintiff insisted that his son was not a bandit and was allowed to return to the countryside to transport the corpse coffin to the city for autopsy to clarify the truth.

### Jiangsu Provincial Supervision Team Arrives in Yangzhou: Punishes Suspected Corrupt Officials: Gu Zuzhen Removed from Office and Arrested

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 1st] On the 11th day of the arrival of the first Jiangsu Provincial Supervision Team in Yangzhou, the team leader, Mai Yun, personally led Commissioner Lin, County Magistrate Wang, and all the staff to inspect the four districts. It was found that the tax revenue accounts of the Fairy Temple Tax Collection and Collection Office were unclear and there was a major suspicion of corruption, so he personally ordered the director Gu Zuzhen to be dismissed from office and investigated, and detained in the county government. This is the first voice of punishing corruption after the Supervision Team left the province. The team left Yangzhou this morning and went to Yiwei.

### Miniature News

Zhenjiang [Our Dispatch] Lin Xingnan, a resident of No. 4 Yuelang Lane in this county, was suddenly robbed by a lone bandit on the night of July 30. Fortunately, the police were caught on the spot. The bandit Wang Xingkui (nickname Yigenmao), from Haizhou, 45 years old, was found with stolen goods and a White Langlin pistol, one bullet, which has been sent to the Provincial Criminal Police Team for interrogation.

Wujin [Our Dispatch] Former County Magistrate Weng Cheng, who also served as the director of the Food and Grain Office during his tenure, the important person in charge of the office Chu Pinjin is on the run after his removal from office, and Ding Jun has left, so the Food and Grain Office cannot be handed over. The newly appointed Xu Xianzhang was originally scheduled to take office on August 1, but he is also very worried about the unclear accounts of his predecessor. In terms of accumulated grain alone, the Food and Grain Office should have transferred more than 20,000 shi to the Management Committee, but there is no trace of it. At the small group meeting of the Council on the 29th, it was agreed that Weng had embezzled a huge amount of grain and did not hand it over, and had put it all into his private pocket. If it is not recovered, this year's grain levy cannot be promoted. A formal representation is now being launched to the provincial government.

Suzhou [Our Dispatch] The Yangcheng District, which is subordinate to the county, borders Yangcheng Lake and has a low-lying terrain. During the yellow plum flood season, about 1,000 mu of low-lying fields near Taiping Bridge in the district were submerged and could not be sown. The district has reported to the County Food and Grain Office to send personnel to investigate in order to reduce the tax.

Dongtai [Our Dispatch] Dongyi's continuous heavy rain, coupled with the seawater backflow, has evolved into a disaster. And many places have collapsed.

Fengxian [Our Dispatch] The Wang family in Xishi, Qiaozhen, raised an infant who is just one year old. He was no different from ordinary children at first, but recently he fell ill for more than a month. After recovering, it was suddenly discovered that the child's upper lip and lower jaw were covered with a beard, looking like a small man, which was temporarily spread as a strange story, and there were many viewers.

[Another Dispatch] The 37th year's quota for land tax in this county has now been approved by the County Council and decided to be 1.2 dou for the levy quota, 6 sheng for the loan levy, 4.8 he for the public grain, 1.2 sheng for the accumulated grain, and 6 sheng for the school grain, and 5 sheng for the county additional, totaling 3.5 dou.

### Guanwai Travels (2) - A Dream Search in Chijin Fort

— Our Reporter Song Lin

[Our Newspaper Jiuquan July 28th Airmail] Staying at the Laojunmiao Oil Mine in Yumen for six days, we visited various production and management departments every day, making everyone feel as if they were on a winding mountain road, with too much to take in. On the morning of July 15th, at 9 o'clock, after waving goodbye to the four towering pillars of Laojunmiao, the reporter group's special vehicle once again sped northwest onto the Gobi Desert.

After traveling 25 kilometers, we encountered a checkpoint of the mine police team, just like the checkpoint we encountered on Qingyun Road when entering the mining area. After simply confirming that it was the reporter group's special vehicle, we were allowed to pass. After traveling another five kilometers or so, an oasis suddenly appeared on the edge of the Gobi Desert. This was the Chijin Fort Oil Mine, where a farm was located.

Chijin Fort is under the jurisdiction of Yumen County. Because it is not on the main road, few people pay attention to it. Only when we arrived there in person were we surprised by its beauty, which surpasses all other places outside the customs. The small mountains composed of red and blue sandstone on the north side of the road are the remnants of the Qishu Mountains, forming a strong and beautiful contrast with the large expanse of lush green farmland on the south side of the road. At the foot of the mountain is the Hongshan Temple, built against the mountain. The office of the Yumen Oil Mine Farm is located in the temple at the foot of the mountain. A clear stream flows around the temple. At the foot of the mountain is a tall pagoda, already showing signs of collapse. Rows of white poplars rustle, and green willows sway in the wind. Three or five cattle and horses stroll in the fields. In the garden next to the temple, many precious flowers are planted, ready to be transported to the Laojunmiao mining area for decoration. This farm was established in the 31st year of the Republic (1942). It originally had 100 mu of land. Last year, it acquired another 5,800 mu of land in the East Lake of Chijin Fort, of which 100 mu have been reclaimed. The remaining 4,800 mu are also planned to be reclaimed within three years. According to the director of the farm, Zhu Jiangong, the farm currently has two staff members leading 250 workers to cultivate the land. In addition to wheat, winter vegetables are the main product. Every winter, 20,000 to 30,000 cabbages are transported to the Shantou mining area. There are even more radishes. The farm currently has more than 100 head of cattle, sheep, mules, and horses, and 260 pigs, just enough for the colleagues in the mining area to celebrate a New Year or festival.

As we stepped into the gate of the farm office, we immediately saw a vertical plaque in the main hall: "Tunken Yuantang" (Land Reclamation Office). Inside the main hall, there was also a couplet written by Yu Xueye in the official script: "Follow the President's teachings and establish a first-class nation-building undertaking; inherit the legacy of Ban Gu and Ma Rong and promote the immortal spirit of the ancient sages." Although the couplet was not particularly well-written, seeing it at this time and in this place, and recalling the impressions of the arduous construction of the oil mine these past few days, greatly moved us. The main hall is used as a reception room. On the walls are inscriptions by Yuan Suxin, Zhao Fengqi, and others, as well as the names of the Eight Views of Chijin: "Camel Bells Startle Dreams," "Flute Playing in the Evening," "Qilian Mountain's Remaining Snow," "Gobi Light Smoke," "White Pagoda Wild Geese," "Ancient Buddha Secluded Rock," "Red Mountain Stone Pot," and "Golden Bull Clear Water." Except for the Golden Bull and Stone Pot, which have been lost and cannot be verified, since this place was a major postal station on the Tang Dynasty route, the remaining scenes are not difficult to imagine, as will be discussed below regarding "Ancient Buddha Secluded Rock." After I had visited the statues in Dunhuang, I realized that the Tang Dynasty statues sculpted in Hongshan Temple were relatively complete. As mentioned earlier, Hongshan Temple is built against the mountain, and includes Hongshan Temple, Biyun Cave, Zixia Cave, Guanyin Rock, and Kui Xing Tower. The buildings are towering, and the pagodas are soaring. According to the inscription on a stele in the temple from the fifth year of the Guangxu reign (1879), the original temple had an iron plaque inscribed with "Guangzhao Daqian" (Illuminating the Universe) by Yuchi Jingde from the Zhenguan era of the Tang Dynasty, indicating that the temple was likely built in the Tang Dynasty. However, later, in the second year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1863), it suffered from the Hui rebellion, and the postal pavilions, residences, and houses were all reduced to ashes. The temple was also destroyed by fire, and the iron plaque was naturally lost. The current temple was rebuilt in the fifth year of the Guangxu reign. The walls and statues in each temple are very crude. Among them, only the Buddha statues in Guanyin Rock Cave are relatively complete. Because they were carved into the cave, it is possible that the entrance of the cave was sealed off when the entire Hongshan Temple was destroyed, leaving it preserved. There is insufficient light and dry air inside. The five bodhisattvas, sitting or standing, and the two fierce-looking Dharma protectors, have superior structures and curves. In particular, the facial expressions, some kind and gentle, some with lowered eyebrows and silent sitting, are expressed even in their fingers. While savoring the melancholic and ancient mood of "Camel Bells Startle Dreams," we had lunch. It had started to rain. The colleagues at the farm advised us to stay here and listen to the camel bells late at night, but we were eager to get to Yumen or Anxi, so we thanked them for their kindness and set off in the rain at 1:45 in the afternoon. The entire Chijin Fort was shrouded in a misty drizzle, with bright and lively colors. Currently, there are only over two thousand households, diligently cultivating the land in the oasis in the desert, dreaming long and ancient dreams...

### General Commodity Prices - Rise Slowly Across the Board - Overall Trend Remains Stable

Following the weak trend at the end of the previous period, commodity prices last week opened at the beginning of the week, due to a flurry of negative news, with most commodities hovering at stable levels. Subsequently, because the negative news could not be confirmed and market credit was loose, commodity prices showed a slow upward trend. Generally speaking, the trend remained stable. Among the classified items, food and building materials fell back, while textiles, chemicals, fuels, and metals rose. The general wholesale price index compiled by this publication was 4,740.348 times, an increase of 2.01% compared to the previous week. Credit generally showed signs of looseness and excess. The National Bank's exchanges repeatedly showed deficits, and underground interest rates were around 50-60 cents.

The government's economic measures last week, which have a relatively close relationship with future commodity prices, include the following:

First, since the government issued emergency economic measures in February of last year, prohibiting the trading of gold ornaments, more than a year has passed. During this time, the country's economic situation has not improved, and black market trading of gold has never disappeared. Recently, the Shanghai authorities approved the industry's request to resume trading in gold ornaments on a trial basis before formal approval from the Executive Yuan. The price is calculated according to the market price of the foreign exchange settlement certificate plus the base price of the US dollar, converting each tael of gold to US$40 according to the legal ratio between the US dollar and gold, plus a legal profit of 20%, operating expenses of 40%, and wages of 50%. According to this calculation, on Monday, the purchase price of each tael of gold ornaments was 320 million yuan, and the selling price was 360 million yuan.

According to the chairman of the industry association, in order to avoid social misperceptions that might stimulate commodity prices, they are adopting a cautious approach to exchanging gold ornaments. There are conflicting opinions regarding the advantages and disadvantages of opening up gold ornament trading. This publication does not intend to predict its future here. We will let the readers judge for themselves.

Second, the case of opening up self-provided foreign exchange is approaching the implementation stage. Huo Baoshu, the chairman of the Import and Export Control Committee, hosted importers, exporters, and the press on Thursday, reporting the main points as follows:

The Executive Yuan, at its eighth meeting on the 21st of this month, passed the "Measures for Overseas Chinese Capital and Domestic Capital Investing in Domestic Production Enterprises," which has been published in newspapers. We can briefly explain its spirit:

(1) Supplementing Production Equipment: Over the past ten years, domestic production enterprises have suffered repeated damage and urgently need to be supplemented and restored. During the war, many domestic factories ordered machines from abroad, which now urgently need to be imported. Overseas Chinese who hope to invest in domestic production enterprises should be given convenience.

(2) Supplementing Production Raw Materials: Article 8 of these measures stipulates that investment is allowed to bring back the main raw materials needed domestically. The list of raw materials is shown in the attached table. These raw materials are lacking domestically and are not included in US aid, while the places where overseas Chinese reside are the main production areas.

(3) Coordinating with Domestic Industrial Needs: The raw materials listed in the currently announced appendix are all extremely lacking domestically. In the future, the announcement will still be coordinated with industrial needs. If domestic supply is sufficient, imports will not be allowed; if there is a shortage, supplementation will be provided.

(4) The Quota System Remains in Place: The purpose of these measures is to supplement the shortage of industrial raw materials. Because domestic raw materials are extremely lacking, the quota system remains in place.

We feel that the severity of the current commodity price problem is indeed due to insufficient production, which is a very important reason. However, insufficient production stems from a lack of raw materials. Therefore, the authorities' measures are an improvement targeted at the facts. However, there are still many unnecessary controls in place. We hope that the authorities will work hard to eliminate them one by one.

Third, regarding the establishment of the Economic Control Bureau, this publication has previously reported that this was discussed at the meeting convened by the President on Mogan Mountain. Whether or not it will be established seems to still be under consideration. This case is of particular concern to the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai.

Fourth, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau found that the China Industrial and Mining Bank in this city had set up secret accounts, established separate business names, and engaged in commercial activities by misappropriating bank funds. It specially requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to order the bank to suspend operations from the 29th. At the same time, the Hankou branch of the bank was also ordered by the Financial Management Bureau to suspend operations immediately because it committed the same offenses. The detailed situation of this case has not yet been publicly announced by the Financial Management Bureau, but this is undoubtedly a major event since the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau.

The trend in the commodity market last week was due to the mutual control of both the bulls and the bears. Except for yarn and cloth, which hit a new high on Friday, most commodities saw ups and downs, but the fluctuations were not large. In terms of food, prices fell slightly due to ample arrivals and sluggish sales. For example, top-quality white japonica rice fell from 40 million at the beginning of the week to 36-37 million on Friday. However, at the weekend, stimulated by the increased price of rationed rice, prices immediately rose, with white japonica rice reaching 43 million. Oil and flour prices rose slowly because the channels were still good. For example, at the end of the week, Qingdao Ji Tong raw oil stood at 11.8 million, and Bingshan No. 1 flour stood at 11.15 million.

In the yarn and cloth market, prices rose considerably due to the temporary suspension of allocation by the Yarn Management Committee and the loose credit situation. On Friday, a new record was set, with 42-count Blue Phoenix standing at 21.6 million, 21-count Double Horse standing at 17.7 million, and Dragon Head fine cloth standing at 5.7 million. Daily necessities such as soap and firecrackers mostly recovered after a period of weakness. Among other items, metals rose by more than 10%, while the rest remained stable.

### Currency and Finance

(1) Credit and Underground Interest Rates

The trend of credit in this city had already turned loose at the end of the previous week. As expected, credit last week became even more relaxed across the board. The amount of funds in the market is also governed by the principle of supply and demand. To summarize the reasons for the relaxation of credit last week, they are as follows:

(1) In the past half month, there have been many rumors about the political situation. The business community is the most sensitive. This has created a situation where sellers are eager to sell and buyers are waiting and watching. Since general commodity prices have not seen a sharp rise due to the issuance of large banknotes, the demand for funds is not as urgent as in the past. This can be said to be a demand-side factor determining the relaxation of credit.

(2) As for the supply side, not only has there been a continuous influx of remittances from other places, but state-owned banks and bureaus have been making every effort to purchase goods from the public during this period of low prices. For example, the Central Farmers Bank paid out 3 trillion yuan for flour in six days. With huge government expenditures, state-owned banks and bureaus have largely reported deficits this week. Funds are not only being supplied from all sides, but also the supply is greater than the demand, so credit is naturally becoming more relaxed day by day.

Commercial banks and firms have been very flexible in deploying funds. Many in the industry are generally long on orders, and some even deposit orders with the Central Bank for cash to be withdrawn the next day. Therefore, interbank lending has been unusually sparse this week. According to the clearing results of banks and firms after the 60th, if the deficit of 2.5412 trillion yuan of the Bank of Taiwan on Thursday and Friday is not counted, the actual deficit from Monday to Friday is only 1.4833 trillion yuan, a decrease of more than 4.87 billion yuan compared to the same period last week.

The underground interest rate in the market last week was generally around 50 cents, which is obviously lower than the daily interest rate of more than 70 cents last week. On Thursday, there was an excess of funds, with interest rates as low as 36 cents. On Friday, the underground interest rate continued to fall below 40 cents, which is rare in recent times. As for cash chips, although the supply has become stronger due to the issuance of large banknotes, because of the severe cash shortage in various places, many have flowed out, resulting in a discount on large banknotes.

State-owned banks and bureaus, with expenditures such as purchasing goods, foreign exchange settlement certificates, and disbursing European funds, had a total deficit of 2.4505 trillion yuan from Monday to Friday, an increase of more than 3.19 billion yuan compared to the same period last week.

Although the foreign exchange intake of foreign banks last week was not as large as the previous week due to the intake of foreign exchange settlement certificates, there was still a surplus of 3.2638 trillion yuan from Monday to Friday, a decrease of 4.3409 trillion yuan compared to the previous week. This also played a considerable role in the overall relaxation of credit last week.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

The domestic remittance rates of commercial banks and firms also generally rebounded amid the loosening of credit. The reason for this is that after credit loosened, there were many customer remittances, and banks and firms did not need to attract remittances with low remittance rates.

The reason why the remittance rate in the Huapu district is higher than in the Central and Northern China districts is simply a symbol of the continued flight of capital to the south. The remittance rate to Guangzhou was 250 yuan on Monday and Tuesday. Although it fell by 20 yuan on Wednesday, it rose to 300 yuan on Thursday. Friday was the same as Thursday.

The remittance rate to Xiamen remained high at 400 yuan from Monday to Friday. The remittance rate to Chongqing was at par before Tuesday, changed to 70 yuan on Wednesday, and rose sharply to 150 yuan on Thursday. On Friday, it rose again to 200 yuan.

The remittance rate to Tianjin was at a discount of 20 yuan before Wednesday, and rose to par on Thursday and Friday, indicating that there were fewer floating funds coming to Shanghai from the north than before. The foreign exchange market last week still saw a sluggish trend in foreign exchange settlement certificates, with transaction prices generally between 3.8 million and 3.85 million. Although gold ornaments are now openly traded in jewelry stores, because the Central Bank is not responsible for supplying gold bars or ingots, the outflow of gold ornaments is greater than the inflow after the opening of business, and the trading situation is quite sluggish.

The Shanghai-Hong Kong remittance rate was slightly longer in the first half of the week, with 100,000 legal tender equal to 9 Hong Kong cents, but it shortened to 8 cents on Thursday. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong fluctuated between HK$5.40 and HK$5.42 from Monday to Thursday. The price of gold per Chinese tael was high on Wednesday, reaching HK$335.50, but was only HK$327.50 on Monday, and fell again to HK$331 on Thursday.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

The Chinese stock market opened weakly at the beginning of the week. After the previous weekend's sharp decline, it saw a slight recovery, but soon weakened again. In the afternoon, due to the stable prices of external commodities and the longer Hong Kong exchange rate, people's confidence was weak, and prices fell sharply, a rare situation in recent weeks. Yong Yarn once fell to the limit, eventually closing at a low price of 9,850 yuan. Except for five stocks such as Xinyi and Zhongfa, all others fell across the board. The next day, due to loose credit, stable external conditions, and the inevitability of reversal after extreme conditions, people's confidence recovered, and various stocks turned from weak to strong, with many hitting the limit. Yong Yarn closed at the upper limit of 10,835 yuan.

On Wednesday, due to reports of rising prices of commodities outside the stock market and the imminent reality of opening up self-provided foreign exchange, there were hopes for industrial and commercial prosperity. Although there were ups and downs due to fierce battles between bulls and bears, the results were consistent gains. Yong Yarn rose by 650 yuan, and Jinglun and Zhongfa both hit the limit. Other stocks rose by half a percent to nearly 20%. On Thursday, news of the suspension of exchange at the China Industrial and Mining Bank dampened enthusiasm. There was selling at high prices, and the process was erratic. As a result, Yong Yarn rose by 120 yuan, closing at 11,570 yuan. Yongye and Lianhua both hit the limit, Xinhe and seven others gained, and the rest turned weak.

On Friday, due to the loose credit situation, buying interest was strong, and market sentiment was soaring. Many entered the upper limit. However, due to concerns among buyers, there was profit-taking and selling. For example, Yong Yarn broke the limit after entering the upper limit several times. As a result, except for Zhongfa, which fell alone, all others rose. Yong Yarn closed at 12,600 yuan, and Rongfeng and Lianhua both hit the limit. Other stocks rose by varying percentages.

At the weekend, due to the President's visit to Shanghai, people's confidence was shaken, and various parties sold off. Except for five stocks such as Tongyi, Hengfeng, Wuhe, Yonggong, and Merlin, which gained slightly, most other stocks showed a slight downward trend.

### Business and Industry Trends

Examining Business and Industry from the Perspective of the Partially Relaxed Regulations on Self-Provided Foreign Exchange

According to a dispatch from the United Press in Nanjing on July 27th, authoritative sources revealed that the Executive Yuan has, in principle, approved two major changes to China's foreign exchange control policy: First, allowing importers to use their own foreign exchange to import production equipment and raw materials; Second, allowing overseas Chinese to remit money back to the country by importing goods.

Indeed, on the 28th of last month, the Executive Yuan officially announced the full text of the measures for overseas Chinese capital and domestic residents with overseas deposits to apply for importing investment in production enterprises. Subsequently, the Shanghai Import Management Committee also formally announced the detailed implementation rules of the measures on the 29th.

According to the measures announced by the Executive Yuan, it is understood that self-provided foreign exchange and overseas Chinese capital, under the relevant regulations of the authorities, can be used to import production equipment and raw materials needed by production enterprises. The so-called production enterprises here are defined as those engaged in industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, water conservancy, public utilities, transportation, agricultural product processing and export, and handicrafts.

Not only that, but the measures also explicitly stipulate that the expansion and establishment of such production enterprises must meet two prerequisites: First, the enterprise must be truly needed by the country or able to increase exports; Second, more than half of the main raw materials needed for the enterprise must be available domestically. As for the import of production raw materials, the measures stipulate that they are limited to those that are lacking domestically and not covered by U.S. aid. It is worth noting that Article 7 of the measures strictly prohibits the transfer of imported materials to others, but Article 8 opens up avenues for the resale of such imported materials. One avenue is to sell them directly to production enterprises that need the materials with the approval of the Import Management Committee, and the other is to entrust designated government agencies to sell them on their behalf.

From this, it is not difficult to see that the government wants to use this method to attract the import of materials that are not included in U.S. aid, and ultimately to control them.

As for whether the measures can achieve the goal of supporting the development of production enterprises, it must be understood from the recent trends in the business and industrial sectors.

First, regarding the so-called public utilities, one of the production enterprises recognized by the new measures, last Tuesday, the Municipal Government held a discussion meeting to save the public utility crisis. At the meeting, each public utility company submitted written reports detailing the financial difficulties of each company.

It is reported that the Shanghai Electric Power Company lost more than 30 billion in June and an estimated 20 billion in July. The British-owned Shanghai Water Company lost a total of more than 1.4 trillion from December 31, 1937, to July of this year; the Shanghai Gas Company is expected to lose more than 200 billion in July; other companies such as the Telephone Company, the French-owned Tram and Electric Light Company, and the Public Transportation Company have all suffered losses of hundreds of billions of yuan or more in recent months. In such a situation, it is difficult to be optimistic about whether public utilities can expand their equipment and operations.

Secondly, regarding the textile industry, not only are raw materials difficult to obtain, but also exports are difficult to develop. According to news from the Economic Information Agency, China Textile Corporation currently has only more than 110,000 piculs of cotton stored in the mainland, and transportation is extremely difficult. From last year to this year, the Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Management Committee originally planned to collect 2 million piculs of cotton, but only received 500,000 piculs. The situation this year is said to be even less optimistic. Speaking of Indian cotton, one of the sources of raw cotton, prices have also risen recently, with cotton of 13/16 inch length rising to more than 1,100 rupees per pound.

Regarding domestic purchasing work, the General Manager of the Textile Construction Company stated that since the occurrence of silver dollar transactions in various places, the purchasing situation has been greatly hindered. In addition, the lack of coal and electricity, the spread of war, and the huge military demand have made it difficult for even the Textile Construction Company to maintain its operations.

As for exports, the threat of competition from Japanese goods can be said to be increasing day by day. According to a report from the Central News Agency last Monday, from the surrender of Japan to the end of June this year, textiles worth several billion Japanese yen have been exported, including 514 million yards of cotton cloth. The export of textiles has become the leading export of Japan.

The New York Foreign Trade Office of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan recently announced the sale of 13 types of Japanese cotton fabrics at reduced prices. According to Nagai, the Director of the Japanese Trade Bureau, this year's private trade in Japan has doubled compared to last year. Under the multiple blows, many cotton textile factories have moved south to Hong Kong, so the so-called encouragement of overseas Chinese capital to return to the country for construction is even more difficult to predict. Furthermore, regarding the shipping industry, not only have operating costs increased sharply and become disconnected from freight rates, but Chinese ships can only carry 25% of U.S. aid materials. Whether the ports of the Yangtze River and Beijing-Hankou will be opened has also become a mystery. Recently, Japanese ships have even gone to Taiwan to transport sugar and to Qinhuangdao to transport coal, resulting in significant losses of private shipping rights, and the shipping industry feels unable to maintain its operations. After the import of overseas Chinese capital materials under government control, whether it can increase the supply of coal, diesel, and oil needed by the shipping industry, and even expand its equipment, can only be proven by events.

This publication has previously summarized the crisis in the business and industrial sectors. It is difficult to predict whether this partial relaxation of the self-provided foreign exchange measures can save the business and industrial crisis to any extent. However, the recent Hong Kong "Far Eastern Economic Review" published an article discussing the flight of Chinese hot money to Hong Kong, which is worth learning from. According to the author of the article, the total amount of deposits in Hong Kong banks is approximately 1.5 billion Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to 350 million U.S. dollars. The article believes that the flight of hot money to Hong Kong began in 1937, and after the war, due to the deterioration of the economic situation and national instability, capital flight continued. The conclusion is that if the legal tender continues to depreciate, the flight of hot money cannot be stopped by any restrictions or propaganda. Therefore, the fundamental solution to this evil is to stop the printing of paper money at home and abroad. From this, it is not difficult to see the fundamental crux of China's current problems. As for the effectiveness of the measure to encourage the import of overseas Chinese capital, the evaluation of the import and export industry in Shanghai is quite noteworthy. People in the industry believe that the partial relaxation of self-provided foreign exchange is indeed a good way to attract overseas Chinese capital, but they hope that the domestic situation can improve day by day, and that the government can seek more practical ways to maintain business and industry. Only then can overseas hot money be attracted, otherwise, if, as in previous months, some domestic yarn factories still plan to set up factories in Hong Kong with purchased equipment, this trend is still worrying.

Indeed, whether the new measures can succeed will naturally have to undergo a severe test by the business and industrial sectors before it can be determined.

### Our National Olympic Football Team to Face Turkey Today, Basketball Team's Second Match Against Belgium

[Report from our newspaper] Whether China can perform better in this Olympic Games can be decided today. The Chinese football team will make its first appearance today, meeting the strong opponent Turkey in the first week of competition. Turkey has repeatedly defeated first-class British amateur teams in friendly matches, and its abundant energy and fast tactics are praised by the London sports community as a dark horse with hopes of reaching the finals. After arriving in England, our football team had two unofficial matches with the American team and both were victorious. Coach Li Huitang said that all the athletes are in peak condition and even made a bold statement that they could participate in the finals. The victory or defeat of our football team today is of great concern to the people of the whole country.

The basketball team's second match will be against Belgium this afternoon. In the second group where our country is located, Poland, which ranked fourth in the last Olympic Games, was originally designated as the seed team, but because Poland did not register, the Philippines, which ranked fifth, was substituted. The other five teams are China, South Korea, Iraq, Chile, and Belgium. It is generally predicted that our country and South Korea are the two teams most likely to win second place. Unexpectedly, our country suffered an unfortunate defeat to Chile in the first match, which cast a shadow on our country's prospects for entering the final eight. Belgium recently met South Korea and lost by only two points, while South Korea's defeat to the seed Philippines was only by one point. From this, it can be inferred that Belgium's strength is also not weak. In today's match, our athletes still need to work hard. Li Shiqiao, the main player of our basketball team, is expected to arrive in London from Singapore yesterday to participate in today's competition.

### Anthropology at Jinan University

— Xu Di

I. Anthropology

As the name suggests, anthropology is the science of studying human beings themselves. To understand the origin of mankind, to understand its characteristics, to recognize the trend of culture, and to promote human peace and happiness, we need to study anthropology. The scope of anthropology is extremely broad, including all human activities in time and space, from natural sciences to social sciences, so its content is extraordinarily broad, and its relationship with us is particularly close. Therefore, in advanced countries in Europe and the United States, anthropology has long become a very important science, and efforts are made to promote research.

II. The Birth of the Department of Anthropology

When the miracle of the discovery of "Peking Man" shocked the world, anthropology also once attracted people's attention, but good times did not last, and the voice of researching anthropology remained silent. During the Anti-Japanese War, academic work was greatly hindered, and anthropology naturally had no hope of development. It was not until the arrival of victory that people in the society and government authorities realized that this science really needed to be established as soon as possible due to the importance of anthropology itself and the actual needs expressed in various aspects at that time. Therefore, the Ministry of Education decided to add a Department of Anthropology at the National Jinan University in Shanghai first when adjusting the departments of various universities and colleges at the beginning of the restoration, and China's first Department of Anthropology was born at Jinan University in the autumn of the 35th year. Why did the Ministry of Education first pay attention to establishing a Department of Anthropology at Jinan University? This has another meaning. Jinan University originally had the mission of overseas Chinese education, and the place where overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia live is a holy place for studying anthropology and ethnology (an important branch of anthropology). The establishment of this department at Jinan University naturally has more practical significance. Overseas Chinese are scattered in various parts of Southeast Asia and have frequent contact with the local indigenous peoples. If they can have extensive knowledge in various aspects of anthropology and ethnology, they will be of great benefit to the entire cultural exchange and personal career. From the perspective of academic research, there is also the convenience and achievement of taking materials locally and giving full play to effectiveness. Therefore, not only overseas Chinese have the need to study anthropology, but all those who aspire to work in Southeast Asia cannot ignore it.

III. A New Garden for Teaching and Research

The Department of Anthropology at Jinan University has only been in operation for two years, so it is naturally far from the ideal state. However, the achievements shown in these short two years are commendable. Everything is the result of human effort and struggle in an unstable life and economic difficulties. When you see the teachers and students' tireless spirit of studying, you can see that its future has been fully guaranteed. Professor Liu Xian, the head of the department, is a practical scholar who specialized in anthropology at Oxford University in England in his early years. He has extensive knowledge in various departments of anthropology, has received strict training, and has published many special research papers, earning a master's degree. He has represented China twice in the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences in Lisbon and Paris and was appointed as a permanent director of the Chinese Committee of the London International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. After returning to China, he has been engaged in lecturing and various academic work for many years and has achieved remarkable results. In the 23rd year, he led a team to Hainan Island to investigate the Li ethnic group, delving into the Li villages, climbing to the top of Wuzhi Mountain, and collecting many specimens. He has published many papers on the study of the Li ethnic group and is one of the authorities in the Chinese anthropological community. When Jinan University was restored and the Department of Anthropology was established, Professor Liu was hired as the head of the department (and also served as the dean of the College of Science). He is dedicated to teaching, patient and encouraging, and spares no effort in supporting younger scholars. The progress of the Department of Anthropology at Jinan University under his leadership is truly remarkable. As for the faculty, it can be described as complete and strong: Professor Wu Shihua, Professor of Physical Anthropology, is a domestic authority in this field and enjoys a high reputation. Professor Xue Zhongdong, Professor of Human Genetics, is an expert in this field and has been teaching for many years. Professor Lu Yudao, who teaches psychology, and Professor Ying Chengyi, who teaches sociology, are all authoritative scholars and well-known figures in their respective disciplines in China and need no introduction. The department is currently in negotiations to hire Professor Esther, a world-renowned anthropologist from Germany, to come to China to lecture, which will have a profound impact on the development of this discipline in our country. In terms of equipment, due to funding constraints, books and instruments are purchased in stages, but the folklore specimen exhibition room that the department has already established is already of considerable scale and extremely valuable. It contains more than 800 folklore specimens, mainly more than 400 daily necessities and artworks of the Gaoshan ethnic group in Taiwan and more than 300 of the Li ethnic group in Hainan Island, which are very valuable cultural materials and are rare in China. Whenever scholars from home and abroad visit this new garden of Chinese anthropology, they express surprise and praise. - Indeed, it is not easy to have such performance in such a short period of time.

IV. Keen Expectations Here is a brief introduction to the outline of the Department of Anthropology at Jinan University, which is a faithful report without intention to exaggerate. It is hoped that it can arouse the attention of Chinese people to anthropology, especially young students who aspire to further study and who are taking college entrance exams, to have some understanding of the discipline and know what to choose. Anthropology is an emerging science that is of great importance to the future of mankind. In our country, it is still virgin land, and its future development is unlimited. Foresight and long-term vision, where to go and what to do, is up to the scholars.

### Fake US Dollars in Shanghai

— Yu Chuang

It can be said that the Shanghai police authorities have severely punished the unscrupulous merchants who illegally trade in black market gold and foreign currency, but driven by profit, there is always a group of people who are willing to take risks and continue to engage in this illegal business. Just looking at the fact that gold and foreign currency cases are still being heard from time to time, it can be seen that this type of transaction has not yet disappeared. However, since trading in gold and foreign currency has become an illegal secret transaction, countless unscrupulous villains have taken the opportunity to muddy the waters, so that even if the victims know they have been deceived, they cannot speak out and can only "eat huanglian (a bitter Chinese herb) like a mute, unable to express their suffering." These villains' methods are much more vicious than the petty hucksters of the so-called gold and foreign currency brokers. For example, some time ago, it was rumored that someone melted gold bars and re-minted gold bars with insufficient purity and sold them on the black market, and the authorities had already arrested people related to this matter. It is expected that after the court hearing, the truth will be revealed. However, among the US dollars circulating on the Shanghai black market, there are also a large number of fake banknotes, which are extremely well-made and can almost be mistaken for real - but I am afraid that many people do not know this?

The American magazine "World Report," published last month, published a Shanghai dispatch reporting the news of these fake banknotes. According to that reporter, J.F. (probably Joseph Fromm, the magazine's special correspondent to Japan and the Far East), the fake US dollars in Shanghai were first discovered two years ago, with denominations of $50 and $20, but they have reappeared in large quantities since May of this year.

Initially, an employee of an American bank in Shanghai suddenly saw a $50 banknote that looked fake when counting banknotes, so he set it aside. Later, the bank's authorities sent the banknote to the bank's head office in the United States for identification. After a few days, the head office replied, returning the original, saying that the banknote was real. However, the employee who counted the banknotes was a very "stubborn" person, and he looked at the banknote carefully again and said that it must be fake. The bank's authorities respected the opinion of their employee very much and sent the banknote to the Federal Reserve Bank (equivalent to the central bank in our country) for identification. The reply came back, also saying that it was real, and the person responsible for the identification even signed his name personally to prove that the banknote was reliable.

However, the employee was still not "convinced," and the bank's authorities, seeing his integrity and incorruptibility, were very impressed and tried again. This time, it was formally submitted to the US Treasury Department. The Treasury Department attached great importance to this matter and sent it to a specially established laboratory for careful research. After a rather complex analysis, it was proven that the banknote was indeed fake!

The person in charge of the Treasury Department's laboratory said that this type of fake banknote is indeed the most technically advanced type of forgery. Not only would laymen be deceived, but even some people who are specifically responsible for identifying fake banknotes would think that it came from the US government's printing press. These two types of fake banknotes (one $50 and one $20) use different paper, so everyone suspects that these two types of banknotes come from two different sources. Some people speculate that the engraving machine may have come from Germany. After the end of the European war, the US military discovered a large number of engraving experts in Nazi concentration camps. Although they were detained, they were treated quite well by the Nazis. Their main task was to specialize in counterfeiting banknotes from Britain and the United States. The fake gold pound notes they made were actually sent to the Bank of England (the British national bank) without any problems, and no one suspected that they were fake banknotes!

Therefore, some people think that perhaps this batch of plates or fake banknotes was smuggled out of Germany by bandits and arrived in Shanghai. There is also another report that Japan once counterfeited a large amount of US dollars, totaling as much as 100 million US dollars, but the Japanese denied that such a thing had ever happened.

According to that reporter, the US military authorities in Shanghai are making every effort to track down the bandits, but although there are many informants, no one can provide concrete evidence. And in the American commercial banks in Shanghai, these fake banknotes are still appearing in an endless stream.

However, I think that these fake banknotes that go to American commercial banks must only be a small minority of the total. Isn't the black market for gold and foreign currency the most ideal "battleground" for fake banknotes?

### New Art of Ejection

— Yuan Yi

Many prosperous restaurants in the United States, because customers often like to linger after meals, which affects business, have now begun to use a new device; when customers sit down on the chair in front of the counter, the counter and the chair slowly rotate to the left together. After turning a few feet, a waitress standing behind the moving counter will serve a dish. The turning continues endlessly, and the dishes are served one by one according to a certain time. If you don't have time to eat, you have to sacrifice. When the last dish is finished, the counter and the customer's chair have turned to the end. At this time, the customer must leave immediately. If he wants to stay and chat, he will inevitably be surprised - it turns out that the chair he is sitting on has turned to this place, and it will naturally fall to the floor below!

### Overcoming the Fear of Water

— Mao Yi

It's the season for mermaids to show off their skills again. But despite the beaches and swimming pools being crowded with people, their numbers are still small compared to the total population. Why is this happening? Frank Dalton, a famous American swimming coach, said it best: "Three-fifths of Americans don't know how to swim... Most of them don't know how to swim and don't want to know—just because they are afraid of water."

As a result of people being afraid of water and refusing to learn to swim, many drowning deaths occur every year. Most of these unfortunate victims are not unable to escape on their own. Swimming experts agree that no matter how acute and profound a person's fear of water is, there is a cure.

There are two simple steps in the process of treating this condition: first, understand the cause of the fear; second, overcome it. An adult's difficulty may be due to his or her personal fear or a childhood fear. In either case, he or she must first find a particular accident or other root cause that makes him or her treat water as an enemy.

The reason for being afraid of water may be very simple, for example, accidentally slipping from the mother's hands into the bathtub while taking a bath as a child, causing pain, and from then on refusing to take a bath, let alone swim.

After knowing the reason why a person is afraid of water, one can prescribe the right medicine. Therefore, a swimming coach should understand psychology, because fear of water is a psychological condition rather than a physiological one. "Fear of water" is usually not difficult to cure. Many adult "patients" have long forgotten the cause of their fear of water, but due to the machinations of the subconscious, they have always been afraid to approach water. For this kind of "patient," the coach or doctor should "get to the root" of the questioning and try to evoke his memory. Once the original cause is traced, he will often smile knowingly, laughing at his past timidity and childishness, and will no longer be afraid of water.

Of course, "fear of water," like other psychological conditions, requires individual treatment depending on the individual symptoms and cannot be treated like diphtheria with a general injection of serum.

Explanation and guidance are the two major elixirs for treating "fear of water." Often accompany a person who is unwilling or unwilling to swim to the swimming place to visit, and at the same time provoke and encourage him or her in words and actions - but do not force him or her - soon he or she will be eager to try and automatically go into the water.

### Leling Jujubes

— Zhu Ying

Leling jujubes are one of the specialties of Shandong Province and have long enjoyed a high reputation. They are crimson in color and as large as cherries, hence the name Leling Small Jujubes. They have a sweet and mellow taste and small, soft pits. Travelers to the area are eager to taste them first.

The trees bloom in the fourth month of the lunar calendar, with yellow and tiny flowers that smell like roses. During the flowering season, bees gather on the trees all night long. The leaves are oval, alternate, and resemble locust leaves, but slightly smaller.

The flowers grow under the leaves, and a flower grows every other leaf. Fruiting is very vigorous. The trees are about ten feet tall, with gnarled branches and trunks. The wood is strong and heavy and is often used for carving book blocks or making axles. It has a wide range of uses.

The northeastern countryside of Leling has abundant jujube forests, which farmers regard as a treasure. Their livelihood for the year depends on the harvest of these jujube forests.

Trees bear the most and best fruit for about ten years, and the taste is also the sweetest. Over time, the yield gradually decreases, the trees gradually wither, and the wood is not as strong and beautiful as before. After that, they no longer bear fruit.

In May and June, the fruits gradually become solid. It is said that on the Dragon Boat Festival in May, small jujubes are used to plug noses, which refers to the size of the jujubes. However, the color is green, and they have no taste when eaten. After the White Dew Festival, they turn red, as the saying goes, "There are no green jujubes after the White Dew." The trees are dotted with red spots like cherries. When picking jujubes, bamboo mats are first laid on the ground to prevent mud from soiling them, and then bamboo poles are used to strike the trees. Thousands of poles fall together, like a sudden rain. Before long, the ground can be covered with a layer of more than a foot thick. However, jujubes are easily spoiled when injured by falling to the ground, so only locals or nearby people can taste the fresh jujubes. Those sold to other places are mostly dried jujubes.

Hedgehogs are good at stealing jujubes, and monkeys climb to the tops of trees to pick jujubes and drop them to the ground. Then they climb down the tree, gather the jujubes together, roll over, stick the thorns onto their bodies, and carry them back to their nests for use in winter. Farmers often tie grass under the trees to make figures, dressed in straw hats and holding bows and arrows, as if guarding. The hedgehogs, mistaking them for humans, dare not approach.

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

The human heart is a wondrous thing; in that square inch of space, it holds countless treasures and rubbish, blossoming flowers and rootless weeds, palaces of gods and territories of devils…

Being cared for and caring for others are both beautiful things, but the former is a joyful enjoyment, while the latter is a painful enjoyment.

A justified hatred is more valuable than a nameless love.

Successful people are not necessarily great, and great people are not necessarily successful. This is an extremely simple matter, but it's a pity that a class of mediocre people can never understand it.

Discounted eyes always mistake gilded metal for real gold.

The pine trees in the mountains are evergreen, but when people break off their branches and plant them in small purple clay pots, appreciating them like bonsai, nurturing them like flowers in a greenhouse, they wither instead.

Having a good heart without good deeds is like having oil in a lamp but not lighting it.

### Protecting the People

— Gongsun Wu

Zhu Jia's abridged version of Mencius, "Essentials of Mencius," has been lost. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Liu Chuanrong began to search for it within Jin Renshan's "Collected Annotations on Mencius by Wang." It was said that he had recovered the original form of this book. Zeng Guofan wrote a preface for it, saying that Liu could only arrange the order, and it was still an incomplete book. I have never liked "Essentials" and "Gist" books, believing they are tools for personal research. If it's for easy reference, it's better to compile an index. Mencius's discussion of benevolent governance focuses on regulating the people's livelihoods. The saying of "hundred acres of land, five acres of homestead" appears five times in his book, suggesting that people's affairs are the most important. The work of sericulture, mulberry planting, chicken and pig farming is the beginning of the kingly way. The meaning of a constant heart and constant livelihood is mentioned twice, which is the foundation of Mencius's political theory. His actions include equally distributing well-field system, rectifying land boundaries, lightening taxes, equalizing grain stipends, reducing punishments, and teaching filial piety and brotherly love. These are his goals. However, Mencius did not speak of democracy or governance by the people. Although there was the saying that "the people are valued, the ruler is light," he knew to respect the people's will. In reality, it didn't exceed the old saying that "the people are the foundation of the state." His discussion of regulating the people's livelihoods was also only for those who win the people's hearts. Two thousand years later, there was Huang Zongxi, who wrote "On the Prince," also not expecting that later generations would have a system of governance by the people. Mencius discussed the concept of "ownership by the people, enjoyment by the people" in great detail. If the passages on winning the people's hearts from the seven books are extracted and arranged into a book, although it would be a fragmentation of the original book, it would be very convenient for beginners. The saying of "protecting the people and reigning as king" can be fully understood at a glance.

### Reporting to Censor Yao Yuanchu in Bai Xia

— Shi Shufan

A wild and uninhibited spirit of the lake and sea, in the blink of an eye, concerns multiply like threads. How can one forgive the world? It is not easy to speak in office! The fiery dust is chaotic and rampant, a cicada chirps loudly in a quiet alley. One should cherish the bitterness of a loyal heart, irrigate the gardens with dark clouds.

I recall my two or three friends, the royal city is separated by the marketplace building. The unfinished chess game marks more than a brief separation, the ground is firm for a pure and chilling excursion. Unceasing insect chirping sobs, the moon turns and flows with no return, within this sparse and rustic constitution, mountain spirits are entwined with wisteria.

### Reply to Yao Yuanchu, Following the Original Rhyme

— Sanmu

How can scattered encounters gather and continue past excursions? I am happy enough to be in the lowest ranks with my cup and bowl. As the day ends, old friends still beg for green, a lonely building illuminated by lamplight in the cool night. Fish and dragons in the capital, Luoyang, are originally mostly illusions, the jackals and tigers of the South cannot be allowed to stay. I want to ask you about news, when will the springs and rocks allow us to search together?

### Creation and Inspiration

— Lianhu

Guo Ruoxu's "Experiences in Painting" records the story of Wu Daozi gaining inspiration from watching General Pei Min's sword dance: "During the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty, General Pei Min, while in mourning, visited Wu Daozi and requested that he paint several walls with gods and ghosts in the Great Palace Temple of the Eastern Capital to assist his deceased. Daozi replied, 'My painting brush has been neglected for a long time. If the General intends to, dance a sword dance for me, so that I may communicate with the hidden through fierce inspiration.' Min then took off his mourning clothes, dressed as usual, rode his horse like the wind, spun left and turned right, and swung his sword into the clouds, rising several tens of feet, like lightning shooting down, he then used his hand to hold the scabbard to catch the sword, the sword pierced the floor and entered. Thousands of viewers were startled and terrified. Daozi then wielded his drawing brush, a sudden gust of wind arose, creating a magnificent sight for the world. Daozi's painting skills throughout his life were never more inspired than this."

Zhang Xu, a great calligrapher of the Tang Dynasty, often talked about his own experience: "At first, I saw porters arguing over the road and gained insight into the art of calligraphy; later, I saw Lady Gongsun's sword dance and grasped its spirit."

Wang Xizhi observed the posture of geese paddling in the water and derived its meaning for calligraphy.

After Sima Qian traveled extensively through famous mountains and rivers, the momentum of his writing grew increasingly vast and magnificent.

Zhou Meicheng's "Immortal Crane of Auspice" poem and Liu Houcun's "Qinyuan Spring" poem, it is said, were both completed in dreams.

The newly appointed President of the Republic of Korea, Dr. Syngman Rhee, I have heard his name, but am not familiar with his deeds. Reading the editorial of this newspaper, I learned that he worked hard for restoration, with perseverance and determination, and achieved success. It can be said that Heaven rewards the diligent.

The history of the Three Hans is very long and closely related to China. The domestic situation, the invasion and insult by Japan, and the oppression of other foreign forces serve as a warning to our country. The Korean people are not lacking in talented and outstanding young heroes. In addition to the organizations and figures listed in the editorial, I also remember two figures who are worth remembering: one is An Jung-geun, and the other is Yun Bong-gil.

In 1909, An Jung-geun assassinated Ito Hirobumi in Harbin, and was arrested on the spot, taken to Tokyo, and martyred for his country. Ito was the Japanese Prime Minister during the Sino-Japanese War, and also the representative for peace talks, forcing Li Hongzhang to sign a humiliating treaty of cession and indemnity. Ten years later, after the Russo-Japanese War, he became the Resident-General in Korea, using Korea as a protectorate, as a prelude to annexation. The Koreans had gritted their teeth for a long time. On the station of Harbin, (Under Russian Police Jurisdiction), he was struck by a bullet and killed. The fate of that illustrious generation of a ruthless hero came to an end. Contemporary commentary compared An to Zhang Liang avenging Korea. However, Zhang Liang's assassination attempt only hit the viceroy's carriage. It was not as good as An's act of killing a strong enemy. The Western press praised him endlessly. The Chinese literary world published a special book, "An Jung-geun," for him. Zheng Yuan of Changsha (the third-place winner in the imperial examination in 1894) inscribed the title, and Liang Rengong wrote "Autumn Wind Cutting Vine Song," published in the "National Customs Report," expressing grief and indignation. Furthermore, the "Bian Qun" magazine had a poem with the signature "Hui Xing" (it is said to be Qian Jun of Yanghu) made a satirical New Yuefu police sentence: "If this revenge is not avenged, I will not live. May Heaven and Earth witness this sincerity. The executioner's dagger gradually plays the zhu, if one strike does not succeed, there will be thousands of years of weeping. It is not as good as this gentleman's good hand, slaughtering the enemy as if slaughtering a dog. A bullet flies out, hitting the heart directly, a clap of thunder shocks the world. Alas, your country has hundreds of millions of people, will there be people rising up later?" Indeed, twenty years later, there was Mr. Yun Bong-gil.

The event took place in 1932, closely following "1918." The "January 28th Incident" ensued, and the Japanese bandits once again staged their "signature trick" in Shanghai, turning the great prosperity of China into ruins. On April 29th, from early morning to noon, Japanese generals, officers, and officials held a celebration meeting in Hongkou Park. Just as their national anthem was being played, Yun Bong-gil suddenly threw a bomb onto the stage from behind the platform. As a result, generals and important figures, such as Shirakawa, Nomura, Ueda, Shigemitsu, Murai, and Kawabata, were either killed or injured, almost wiping out all the demons in one fell swoop. It was truly avenging and righting the wrongs for the people of Shanghai who had suffered destruction, without implicating the Chinese side. This is his great heroic and chivalrous spirit, even surpassing that of Mr. An in the past.
