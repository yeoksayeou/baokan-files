### President Weng Convenes Financial and Economic Chiefs for Economic Control Meeting; Price Controls to be Applied Flexibly to Revitalize the Market; Continued Discussions This Morning for Final Decisions

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 27th] Premier Weng Wenhao, in order to study and formulate supplementary new measures for financial and economic reforms, and to seek stability in the current economy, specially invited heads of political economy and life management departments and economic management officials to Government House No. 1 at 3:00 PM on the 27th for an economic control meeting. Attendees included Wang Yunwu, Xu Kan, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Dawei, Guan Jiyu, Gu Zhenggang, Xu Baiyuan, Li Weiguo, Zuo Shunsheng, Shen Yi, Wu Zhaohong, and Wu Guozhen and Jiang Jingguo, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai, and Liu Gongyun, among others, totaling more than ten people. Premier Weng personally presided over the meeting. First, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Guozhen, Jiang Jingguo, and Xu Kan reported on the supervision of economic controls in various regions, as well as the phenomenon of materials escaping from Tianjin, Shanghai, and the southwest. Then, new supplementary measures for finance and economics were discussed, with a broad exchange of views on various financial and economic issues. The price control issue, which is of most concern to the general public, was discussed for the longest time. The opinions of the participants were largely consistent, and it was generally agreed that the price control policy should be maintained. However, this policy must be applied flexibly, and any unreasonable price limits should be actively adjusted to revitalize the market and regulate supply and demand. In particular, the prices of daily necessities for the people's livelihood must be stabilized. Points such as increasing production, implementing allocation by coupons, controlling materials, and tightening issuance were also generally approved at the meeting. The participants spoke enthusiastically, and made practical and in-depth reviews of the current economic situation. They unanimously advocated that countermeasures should be decided immediately and announced as soon as possible. The results of the discussions on the 27th, due to some issues still awaiting detailed study, were scheduled to be held again at 9:00 AM on the 28th to continue the discussion and make a final decision. These new measures include various countermeasures related to solving current financial and economic problems, and are another complete set of financial and economic measures after the currency reform. It is expected that after the announcement of these new measures, the economic situation will improve, and the recent unstable economic situation can gradually stabilize.

[Our Report] Mayor Wu Guozhen, summoned by Premier Weng via telegram, took a express train to Nanjing at 7:30 yesterday morning with Section Chief Zhang Bide of the Protocol Section to attend the important meeting convened by the Executive Yuan yesterday afternoon.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 27th] Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen and Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo arrived in Nanjing by plane from Shanghai on the morning of the 27th. They immediately called on Premier Weng in the morning to report on the economic management work in the Shanghai area. Mayor Wu also paid a visit to Premier Weng at 2:00 PM to report on the situation of Shanghai's municipal administration and industry and commerce. Both of them attended the Economic Management Committee convened by Premier Weng in the afternoon and are scheduled to return to Shanghai after continuing to attend the Economic Management Committee on the 28th.

### Zhang Lisheng Discusses Economic Management in Peiping and Tientsin, Says There is No Such Thing as Cancelling Price Controls

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 27th] Executive Yuan Vice President Zhang Lisheng returned from supervising economic management in the north and attended the Economic Management Meeting on the same day to report on the progress and difficulties of the work. He met with reporters on the evening of the 27th and spoke freely about the situation in Peiping and Tientsin over the past two months. Zhang first stated: "My failure is due to ineffective supervision, but the overall policy has not failed. As for the rumor that Peiping and Tientsin have canceled price controls, there is no such thing. However, I admit the existence of the black market, and the black market prices are higher than those in Nanjing and Shanghai. But the Supervision Office still adheres to government laws and severely punishes illegal merchants and cracks down on the black market." Zhang also stated: "The source of food in Peiping and Tientsin is difficult. Most people have stored several months' worth of food. Therefore, the crackdown focuses on being lenient to households and severely punishing merchants. The first step taken is education, followed by action." Zhang admitted that the low salaries of public servants and teachers, the rampant black market prices, and the escape of materials are important issues that should be reviewed today. However, "negotiated pricing" is absolutely unacceptable, and is not worthy of consideration. Zhang firmly opposes negotiated pricing, but adjusting prices, dredging food sources, increasing production, and facilitating transportation are all issues that should be considered and studied. Zhang's return to Peiping after this trip to Nanjing is not yet determined, because Zhang believes that the main target of supervision is the people's exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies, and the control of prices should be the responsibility of the local government. Zhang spoke firmly, hoping that the people would jointly assist the government in completing the established policy under difficult circumstances with multiple factors.

### Legislators Luo Heng and Others Request the Formulation of Supplementary Regulations for Issuance to Manage Currency Quantity and Maintain the Credit of Gold Yuan

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 27th] Legislators Luo Heng and 58 others recently proposed to expedite the formulation of supplementary regulations for the issuance of Gold Yuan, implement the management of currency quantity, restrict issuance in stages, and stipulate the limited legal tender status of subsidiary coins to stabilize the currency value. They advocated that the government should make every effort to maintain the credit of the Gold Yuan, and open up new sources of revenue or strictly economize expenditures, so that the total amount of 2 billion Gold Yuan must be maintained at least until the end of 1950 (that is, when the Temporary Provisions for the Period of National Crisis expire). According to the provisions of the Temporary Provisions, the four methods in the Financial and Economic Emergency Decree promulgated by the President on August 20 should be completed through legislative procedures and separate laws should be formulated. At the same time, a "Supplementary Regulations for the Issuance of Gold Yuan" should also be formulated.

In the first stage, from the date of currency reform, the amount of Gold Yuan standard currency issued in the first month to the third month shall not exceed 50% of the total issuance amount, that is, 1 billion Gold Yuan (of which 600 million yuan will be used to collect gold, silver, and foreign currency, 300 million yuan will be used to make up for the fiscal deficit, and 100 million yuan and subsidiary coins equivalent to 100 million yuan will be used to collect legal currency and Northeastern circulating notes. By this point, the 100 million yuan of subsidiary coins may not be included in the issuance of standard currency. 2. In the second stage, from the fourth month to the eighth month after the reform, a total of five months, the amount of Gold Yuan standard currency issued each month shall not exceed 4% of the total issuance amount, that is, 80 million Gold Yuan. 3. In the third stage, from the ninth month to the sixteenth month after the reform, a total of eight months, the amount of Gold Yuan standard currency issued each month shall not exceed 2.125% of the total issuance amount, that is, 42.5 million Gold Yuan. 4. In the fourth stage, from the seventeenth month to the twenty-ninth month after the reform, a total of thirteen months, the amount of Gold Yuan standard currency issued each month shall not exceed 1% of the total issuance amount, that is, 20 million Gold Yuan. (2) Stipulating that the standard currency has unlimited legal tender status, and the subsidiary currency has limited legal tender status. (3) Increasing the supervisory authority of the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee over the quantity of Gold Yuan issued in installments, and renaming the "Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee" to "Gold Yuan Issuance Supervisory Committee." (4) Supplementary provisions should also be made for various technical issues concerning the issuance and exercise of subsidiary coins.

Editorial

### The Economic Sickness Cannot Be Delayed Any Longer!

The market these days is, to put it mildly, like celebrating New Year's Eve or New Year's Day; to put it more urgently, people generally feel threatened by the shortage of daily necessities. Of course, the people also know that what the government says about "not having shortages" is not a deception, but it is a fact that goods cannot be bought at the fixed prices. You can't buy rice, you can't buy oil, you can't buy firewood and coal briquettes, you can't buy fish, meat and vegetables. The government sets fixed prices on the surface, but the market is actually a black market! The government naturally cannot but rush to plan for this extraordinary situation, and the people cannot but anxiously hope for a solution. The situation has reached this point, and it is absolutely impossible to remedy it by further delays?

Therefore, Premier Weng is anxious, and Minister of Finance Wang is also anxious. Thus, in the secret review meeting in the Legislative Yuan on the 18th of this month, Premier Weng analyzed the causes of the "abnormal" situation, and Minister of Finance Wang put forward four remedial measures. On the 21st, Premier Weng convened a meeting of key central managers, but opinions were not unified; on the 23rd, Premier Weng flew from the capital to Peiping to ask for instructions from the President; on the 24th, he sought the opinions of professors and experts from various universities in Peiping; on the 25th, Premier Weng flew back to the capital, and the professors in Peiping published their "Petition for the People"; on the 26th, the Legislative Yuan resolved to eradicate panic buying and submitted inquiries to the Executive Yuan, while the Control Yuan resolved to submit a correction proposal to the Executive Yuan; on the 27th, Premier Weng convened supervisors in charge of various regions to discuss supplementary measures for economic reform, but no results were achieved. It is said that even if some results are achieved in today's continued discussions, it will still have to wait for the discussion and approval of the Central Political Conference of the Kuomintang, and then be submitted to the political affairs meeting of the Executive Yuan for a decision. In this way, this urgent problem will inevitably have to be delayed for another two or three days; however, "delay" is ultimately not a solution to the problem!

The "abnormality" of the economic situation is the symptom of an economic illness. This disease starts with the disruption of the economic flow and ends with the panic buying of goods. Twenty days ago, the trend of panic buying began; now the trend of panic buying seems to have subsided in Shanghai, but in reality, there is almost no goods to buy, so how can people panic buy? If you hired a doctor who only looked at the superficial symptoms, you might mistakenly think that the illness has improved at this time, but in fact, the evil has sunk inward. Without a powerful medicine, I am afraid that the "disease will not heal." The "Petition for the People" by the professors of various universities in Peiping, although not necessarily a perfect remedy, is at least a decoction prescribed based on the pulse and medical history, and will not be completely ineffective. What the central government is discussing should also be largely the same. Unfortunately, this prescription is a little too late in being contributed; or perhaps there were people who offered suggestions before, but only because they were not famous doctors in the old capital, they were not valued by the authorities, and the economic illness was allowed to gradually enter a hopeless stage. But today, we respectfully advise the government authorities not to hide their illness from the doctor any longer, and not to delay this serious economic illness any further.

In a nutshell, the government must be responsible for ensuring that good civilians holding Gold Yuan notes can buy the essential necessities of life. To do this, we must first start with "smooth flow of goods"; and to "smooth the flow of goods", we must completely remove all man-made root causes that block the exchange of goods from top to bottom, from beginning to end. Recently, we have often heard the authorities loudly calling for encouraging the mutual exchange of materials in various places, which shows that they also know the importance of the exchange of goods and the danger of "economic stagnation." Little do they know that the responsibility for the morbid state of today's goods not flowing smoothly lies with the government itself. If you don't think about this root cause, but instead use "barter" to promote exchange in a piecemeal way, it is really like what Mencius said, "Why should Xu Zi not be afraid of trouble?" Therefore, the first step in treating today's serious economic illness lies in removing the dams built by the government to block the exchange of goods - checkpoints everywhere! This dam has long exceeded the scope of inspection required by the measures to crack down on hoarding!

Secondly, we can talk about fixed prices and negotiated prices. Today, Shanghai has fixed prices, and many places have negotiated prices. Shanghai with fixed prices cannot buy necessities, Chengdu with negotiated prices is gradually filling up with goods, and Tianjin, which has abolished fixed prices and switched to negotiated prices, has seen prices gradually fall; what does this show? Now it seems that talking about negotiated prices is destroying fixed prices and violating the emergency measures order of "August 19th": this is not the case. On the contrary, only knowing to fix prices on the surface but actually failing to fix them, turning a blind eye to the rampant black market, or disregarding the fact that people cannot buy their essential necessities, this is destroying fixed prices. Although Article 13 of the strengthened economic control measures attached to the "August 19th" order stipulates fixed prices, Article 14 clearly stipulates that "if there are special reasons, prices may not be increased without the approval of the competent authorities," which shows that the competent authorities should consider reasonable adjustments for those who request adjustments to their prices for special reasons. Only by allowing reasonable negotiated prices can there be reasonable fixed prices; negotiated prices and fixed prices seem to be opposite but are actually complementary. Moreover, to strictly fix prices, they must be fixed uniformly across the country, and there cannot be fixed prices here and no fixed prices there, fixed prices for A and no fixed prices for B. In short, the time has come for the government to be responsible for resolving the economic crisis. We earnestly hope that it will no longer argue over the terms "fixed prices" and "negotiated prices", but must seek an effective remedy for "smooth flow of goods".

### Annual Meeting of the Institute of Engineers: Special Topic Discussion on China's Construction Investment Issues, Presidential Office Telegraph Urges Registration of Industrial Talents

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 27th] The annual meeting of the Institute of Engineers was presided over by Zhao Zukang this morning. First, Yang Jiayu, Director of the Taiwan Construction Department, gave a speech entitled "Introduction to Taiwan's Construction", which was divided into four areas: farmland, water conservancy, industry and mining, and transportation. He said that Taiwan has entered the stage of increasing production after three years of restoration work. Various important facilities and outputs have exceeded the records of the Japanese occupation period, such as water conservancy, agricultural products, and electricity. As for industry and mining, they have not yet been fully developed, which is limited by the relationship between raw materials and trade. The inherent conditions for Taiwan's construction are actually poor, especially water conservancy is the most serious problem. More than 40 large and small rivers are more harmful than the Yellow River. Therefore, the provincial government is investing heavily in water conservancy projects, with annual recurring expenses reaching 20 billion Taiwan dollars. In addition, it is also engaged in fundamental projects. It plans to complete the Shihmen Reservoir in five years, with a budget of 40 billion Taiwan dollars, which is beyond the financial capacity of the province. Therefore, it plans to issue water conservancy public bonds, which will be converted into kind to avoid the impact of currency values and facilitate progress. The future of Taiwan's construction is actually quite difficult, especially the problem of raw material supply and the problem of integration with the whole country, which need to be studied urgently. I hope the conference will provide opinions. Zhao Zukang then added that he felt that Taiwan's construction had three advantages: (1) public works are widely constructed, (2) agriculture, industry and mining are closely coordinated, and (3) labor is fully utilized. Therefore, the central government should do its best to assist Taiwan in increasing production and assist various provinces in the mainland. Then began a special topic discussion, with Cheng Xiaogang speaking on "China's Construction Investment Issues" and Yun Zhen serving as chairman. Cheng said that there are two types of investment: one is investment for need, and the other is investment for profit. The former belongs to national defense and public construction, and the latter belongs to people's livelihood. Both must obtain strong guarantees from the government to be fully absorbed. Therefore, the management should be coordinated with policies and should not actively interfere. It is also necessary to avoid unnecessary duplication and excessive regional self-sufficiency, and should pay attention to regional connections. Then, members Xu Sizeng and others expressed their opinions, which are summarized as follows: At present, construction investment, whether from domestic or foreign businessmen, is in a standstill. To find out the root cause, the government should immediately engage in (1) sorting out old debts to restore credit, (2) guaranteeing profits so that long-term investment can be profitable in the short term. For key industries such as transportation and electricity, the government should subsidize or state-owned. Secondly, in terms of attracting capital, the current currency value is unstable, and it is appropriate to issue a substitute unit outside the currency system. The conference afternoon was a report on the affairs of various specialized societies and branches. The topic for the special topic discussion was the possibility of Taiwan's industrial development. The outline includes (1) Taiwan's industrial environment, (2) the expansion and limitations of existing industries, and (3) industries that can be newly established.

[Central News Agency Taipei Dispatch, 27th] The United Annual Meeting of Chinese Engineers recently received a telegram from the Presidential Office, urging the registration of industrial talents for national use. Those who have not registered in the past can obtain a form from the joint office of the conference to fill in and submit. The following is an excerpt from the Presidential Office telegram: "It is found that the attending members of your association are all domestic engineering experts, and their personnel information should be collected separately for reference in personnel registration. A hundred talent registration forms are attached, and you are requested to forward them to be filled in and returned before the closing ceremony."

The U.S. delegation to the UN General Assembly convened itself on the 27th to discuss the Korean issue. Authoritative sources said after the meeting that the fate of U.S. troops in Korea will be decided by this session of the United Nations General Assembly. At a minimum, the United States will request that this General Assembly fully approve the May 10th election in the U.S. military-controlled area of South Korea. The source said that if so, countries will successively recognize the Syngman Rhee government established after the election. The UN General Assembly's Political Committee will begin debating the Korean issue within ten days.

He said that after the elections, after the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops, "the Korean people, originally divided by foreign countries, will be able to restore true national unification. Thereafter, patriotic democratic leaders who are willing to coordinate with the other side for the sake of national unification can complete the historic task of establishing a unified government." Kim denied rumors that he and other right-wingers were involved in the "anti-Rhee" conspiracy.

He authorized him to appropriately relax restrictions on commercial transportation. Zou Jidao was acting on Yang's orders. He requested the court to send a letter to Minister Chen for investigation. The court then stated that this was quite relevant to the defendant. If there was such a fact, the defendant could provide proof. Then, Wang Sizu, the leader of the action team of the Economic Police Brigade, requested to make a statement because new evidence had been discovered.

The amount of bribery determined the quantity of coal allocated.

It was stated that the two defendants, Sun Gangce and Lin Keying, had engaged in threatening and receiving bribes from the Changzhou Wujin Electrical Company and the Suzhou Electrical Company. Regarding the Changzhou Electrical Company, the company needed 1,400 tons of coal per month, and the amount of coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee was uncertain, depending on the amount of bribery. The method of soliciting bribes was quite clever, using various pretexts, such as claiming to be raising donations for schools or being entrusted by sick friends to borrow money. Afterwards, they were never repaid. During festivals, gifts had to be given. Sun Jice sent a handwritten letter to Manager Jiang of the company, stating that his friend was sick and asking to send 20 million legal tender to Shanghai, etc. Wang sent it as instructed. At the end of last year, they sent Sun and Lin each a Parker pen of the 51st model and a Movado watch. During the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival this year, they also sent 6 cans of Chalike cigarettes and 2 bottles of Baijiadi wine each. In September, they also sent 100 gold yuan.

The quantity of coal allocated immediately changed.

Regarding the Suzhou Electrical Company, the company needed 3,500 tons of coal per month. At the end of last year, Sun Jice sent a letter through someone stating that he needed to purchase 100 dan of rice but did not have the money to pay for the seedlings, asking them to temporarily advance the money. Manager Zhang politely declined. Before long, the coal allocation changed. In December, it was reduced to 3,000 tons. In January of this year, it was reduced to 2,500 tons, of which 1,500 tons had to be transported to Nanjing. Manager Zhang had no choice but to visit Sun's residence at the beginning of the year with Assistant Manager Ding of the company for the New Year, leaving behind a bill of exchange for 100 million. By March of this year, the coal allocation had been restored, and the convenience of collecting coal in Shanghai was granted. In the following months, he did not continue to offer gifts. In August, it was reduced by 500 tons again, and they were notified that it would be reduced by another 200 tons in September. Manager Zhang believed that the factual need was indispensable, so he borrowed a check for 1,000 gold yuan from a friend surnamed Zhang and sent it to Sun's residence on September 22nd. Sun agreed to help, and then formally stated in the office that the reduced coal quantity for August would be reissued immediately, and September would be allocated as usual. The company also gave a big banquet for the staff of the association at the Xinghualou in this city. When asked by the court, Sun claimed to have raised 20 million for the "Humanities Research Institute," and the loan for a friend's illness was returned afterwards. He did not remember whether he had received gifts. However, he denied the matter of asking the Suzhou Electrical Company to advance money for rice. Afterwards, Le Zhuangxin, the investigation section chief of the Municipal Government, came to the court to testify. Then, the defense lawyers of each defendant provided their defense separately. They adjourned from court at around 1:00 PM and ordered a retrial at another date.

### Suspected Communist Spy Student Case: First Group of Nine Indicted; Liu Zongjun and Fifteen Others Not Indicted

[Report from this newspaper] The special criminal court has concluded its investigation of over eighty students accused of being communist spies. The portion of the investigation led by Prosecutor Wang Naizhang was announced yesterday. Defendants Li Lingyun and five others, as well as Shi Zongjiang and four others, were all indicted for endangering the nation. Liu Zongjun and fifteen others were not indicted. Details are provided below:

Facts of the Indictment

The indictment against five students from the Shanghai Art College (美專), Li Lingyun, Lu Hanhua, Chen Liping, Wu Shuzhi, and Liu Ming (female), states: "On June 5th of this year, a group of students in this city, under the pretext of opposing American support for Japan, held a collective demonstration. On the same day, a section of the Shanghai Art College's student union also prepared to demonstrate, but were prevented by another section of the school's students, resulting in a fight in which Li Lingyun, Lu Hanhua, Chen Liping, Wu Shuzhi, and Liu Ming were injured and sent to the police hospital for treatment. During their treatment, they secretly communicated with students visiting from outside the school via notes. After the police bureau seized these notes, they were deemed to contain elements of a subversive organization, and the defendants were sent to court for investigation. According to the defendants' statements, they claimed ignorance of the details of "Opposing America's support of Japan," but investigation revealed that Li Lingyun wrote notes to Lu Hanhua and Chen Liping, placed them in matchboxes, and threw them onto the road for students like Zheng Yu of the Shanghai Art College. The wording was strong, and reviewing the contents shows that the defendants' "Oppose America's support of Japan" demonstration was a planned and organized action. Furthermore, two unmailed letters from Wu Shuzhi to Xiao Han (i.e., Liu Ming) were found on his person, expressing great admiration for Liu's work for the week and mentioning going to Jiaotong University (交大) on the fourth. He also admitted during the court hearing that he did go to the Jiaotong University student union on the afternoon of the fourth to make contact, and that Liu Ming was very busy helping to cut and paste newspapers and cartoons. Furthermore, a letter from the China Vocational Student Self-Government Association (中華職業學生自治會) to the injured students of the Shanghai Art College was discovered, stating: "We feel angry in our hearts that you were beaten for participating in the anti-American support of Japan rally. You Shanghai Art College students must be the spark that ignites [the revolution], and we will always follow you in marching towards tomorrow. We must win." In addition, many similar letters were seized. All of this is sufficient to prove that the defendants participated in communist activities. Furthermore, investigation revealed that during the student demonstration, the police bureau intercepted communist propaganda on the Bund, including one item listing reactionary slogans and including "The CCP Northwest Central Bureau's Announcement of Celebrating the Liberation of Yan'an (中共西北中央局慶祝光復延安之通告)." Therefore, it is extremely clear that this anti-American support of Japan demonstration and the distribution of leaflets were orchestrated and propagandized by the communists. Since the defendants had prior criminal intent and contact, even though they were temporarily prevented from participating by fellow students within the school, they still cannot escape joint responsibility. Li Lingyun and others are all suspected of violating Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Statute for the Punishment of Endangering the Nation During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion (戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例) and Articles 11 and 28 of the Criminal Law (刑法), and are being prosecuted according to the law."

The indictment against the other four defendants, Shi Zongjiang, Zhou Jingyong, Tao Dingguo, and Zhu Peigen, states the following facts: Shi was the person in charge of communist intelligence at Fudan University, investigating our students' activities and participating in various student movements; Zhou was a student at Jinan University, participating in the student union and instigating student movements; Tao was a student at Tongji University, participating in the communist spy organization; Zhu was a student at Soochow University, a key member of the communist party at the school, responsible for contacting, printing, and disseminating the student newspaper, and is the son of Zhu Xuefan. Fifteen individuals were not indicted due to insufficient evidence of criminal activity: Liu Zongjun, Huang Guangchao, Zhao Zihan, Gu Kejian, Qin Yiming (above from Fudan), Zha Hongbao (female), Chen Fuheng, Chen Dingping, Zhang Shirong, Luo Jiaqi (above from Soochow), Wang Gangjun (Shanghai Baptist University), Sha Zhen (female) (Tongji), Wu Yuanzheng (Nantong College), Xu Yi (Minzhi New College), Wang Rongbao (Yongan Company employee).

### A Light Sketch of the Water Towns of Huzhou Prefecture

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Chu Yusheng

(Chen Gongxia, the Chairman of Zhejiang Province, is on a tour of Huzhou Prefecture. This reporter accompanies him. The scenery is beautiful, and the resources are abundant. If further improvements can be made, the future is unlimited. Therefore, this article is written to record this.)

Traveling north from Hangzhou along the Grand Canal, the fields on both banks are like brocade, with mulberry and locust trees forming forests. In the distance, the mountains rise and fall, the rivers crisscross, and the branches diverge. Lotus ponds and fishponds are everywhere. This is also a water town, but slightly different from those of Jiaxing (嘉). Jiaxing is mostly flat plains, while this area also has hills and mountains.

After two hours by steamboat, we turn into Deqing County. Three hours later, we arrive at Deqing City. Deqing was occupied by the enemy twice during the War of Resistance. The mountains surrounding the county seat are like a protective screen. The waterways run through the city, connecting to Tangxi in Hangzhou County, Linghu in Wuxing, Xinshi in Jiaxing, Wuzhen in Tongxiang, and Shimenwan in Chongde. Transportation is convenient in all directions, and most of the county residents use boats as their only means of transportation. The houses in the city are neat, and the people's clothing is also clean. Before the war, Deqing County had a population of 170,000, but after the war, it only has 140,000.

The county produces silkworms, fish, water chestnuts, and wool, among other things. Rice production is not high, and the supply is barely sufficient for the county's needs. The silkworm production this year is 5,000 dan, and the autumn silkworm harvest is very good. The selling price is also very good, and each dan can get 120 to 130 yuan, which can also buy six or seven dan of rice at the fixed price. The fish here are freshwater fish, with an annual output of about 10,000 dan, which are transported and sold to Shanghai and other places. This year, due to more rain and rising rivers, the harvest is not as good as ideal. Water chestnuts are also a specialty and can be transported to Shanghai for use in making water chestnut flour. This year's output is particularly high, and the price is not good. The annual wool production is about 1,000 dan, which is transported to Shanghai and then shipped abroad. The local selling price is about 100 yuan per dan.

Generally speaking, the economic situation in Deqing County is not too bad. However, since the government implemented price controls, there has also been a buying panic. The goods in the stores are hidden away, pork is hard to buy, rice is also difficult to buy, and even pickled cucumbers and other items from the pickle shops are not for sale.

From Deqing to Linghu, the steamboat takes two hours. This is a place that is thriving. It also produces silkworms, water chestnuts, and fish and shrimp, and the output is quite abundant.

From Linghu to Wuxing County, the steamboat also takes two hours. Along the way, lotus ponds stretch continuously. Many lotus barrels carry young girls, rowing into the depths of the lotus leaves to pick fresh water chestnuts.

In the county seat of Wuxing, the most essential areas are paved with cement roads, and the shops on both sides are very neat and look very prosperous. The county seat has a population of more than 110,000, and the entire county has a population of 560,000. This area is rich in silkworms, with an annual output of 150,000 dan. There are many silk factories, and there are also many households with zero-loom weaving. There are two newspapers in the area, one is the Huzhou Daily (湖報) and the other is the Commercial Daily (商報). The Huzhou Daily has a daily circulation of 800 copies, and the Commercial Daily has a slightly smaller circulation.

In addition to silk, Wuxing also produces water chestnuts, fish, shrimp, and wool. There is also a kind of writing brush, which is also a famous product. Anyone who uses a writing brush to write Chinese characters knows the great reputation of "Huzhou brushes" (湖筆). The advantage of Huzhou brushes is that they do not shed hair, and the manufacturing method is very exquisite. Its farthest sales area is Harbin. However, the famous "Huzhou brushes" are not produced in Huzhou County itself. They are born in Shanlian Town in Deqing County, where many families make a living by making brushes. During the War of Resistance, the enemy dropped bombs on Shanlian Town, driving the brush makers to other places, and most of them chose to go to Suzhou. The current production is not as high as before.

A person from Wuxing told me: "Wuxing County is the end of the mountains and the beginning of the water." The so-called end of the mountains refers to the foot of the Tianmu Mountains. The beginning of the water is the beginning of the Tiaoxi River, and it is also on the edge of the Taihu Lake basin. If we describe it, Wuxing, or even Huzhou Prefecture, can be said to have both the beauty of mountains and water. It is a pity that many mountains have not been widely planted with trees, and many rivers have not paid attention to dredging. If trees are planted on the mountains and rivers are dredged, this year's fishing season should be very good. Moreover, after the rivers are dredged, and the water chestnut seedlings are improved and planted, the water chestnuts produced must be fat, large, and of good quality.

The climate in Huzhou Prefecture is mild and suitable for sheep farming. The wool here is already sold abroad. If the grass that the sheep eat is studied and improved, and the sheep's living quarters and pastures are cleaned and rationalized, a lot of foreign exchange can be earned from wool alone.

Now, due to price controls, most of the materials in Huzhou Prefecture are frozen. Taking fish as an example, many people do not catch fish from the fish ponds to transport and sell to Shanghai. This will affect future production.

The security situation in Huzhou Prefecture is very good. In more than a year, theft cases have become almost an exception. I think in this stable environment, the people of Huzhou Prefecture should find ways to improve their own production!

### Increase Tung Oil Production; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Sends Personnel to Guizhou Province for Inspection

[Airmail from this newspaper, Guiyang, 23rd] In order to increase the output of tung oil in Guizhou Province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry specially dispatched Inspector Deng [illegible] to inspect the area. After arriving in Guiyang on the 9th, he went to various counties for on-site inspections. According to Deng, "Tung oil ranks first in our country's export commodities. The demand from the United States and other industrial countries is extremely large. It is estimated that annual exports require approximately 400 million pounds, but our country's pre-war output was only over 100 million pounds. Even if all of it is exported, the difference is still very large. During the war, many tung forests were damaged. Due to the difficulty of foreign sales, tung farmers did not pay attention to the tung forests, and even cut down the tung forests for fuel, resulting in a sharp reduction in output. The current export demand has increased sharply, and it is impossible to supply a large quantity. In order to cooperate with national policy and earn foreign exchange, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has decided that starting from the 38th year of the Republic, tung oil production will be greatly increased in the main tung-producing areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, Zhejiang and other five provinces. Currently, preparations are being made for investigation and design work. It is expected to complete the task within the year in order to implement concrete measures to increase production next year." Deng Juye consulted with the Department of Construction and the Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute (省農改所), and the Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute dispatched technician Liu Ganming to conduct on-site investigations in the main tung-producing areas of the province and collect various data on the production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales of tung oil as the basis for formulating the implementation plan. It is planned to select three suitable locations in eastern Guizhou, northern Guizhou, and western Guizhou to set up tung oil factories for demonstration purposes.

### Huainan Coal Piled Up Awaiting Transportation; Huainan Railway to be Restored to Chaoxian County, Then Use Small Boats to Transport to Wuhu for Transshipment

[Report from this newspaper, Wuhu, 27th] Huainan coal production has exceeded 4,000 tons per day. However, due to the single-track transportation of the Jinpu Railway, it is impossible to smoothly transport all of it to Pukou (浦口), resulting in a coal shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai. The black coal from the Jiulonggang (九龍崗) and Bagongshan (八公山) producing areas is piling up. To this end, the Huainan Mining and Railway Bureau plans to speed up the restoration of the Hefei-Yuxi (合肥裕溪) section after the Shuishui (水合) section is opened to traffic, so that Huainan coal can be transported separately on two lines to Pukou and Yuxikou (裕溪口) on both sides of the Yangtze River, and then transferred to boats to supply various ports along the Yangtze River. It is now learned that the restoration of the Hefei-Yuxi section is limited by the lack of steel rails, so only the Hefei-Chaoxian County section can be completed first. The Chaoxian County-Yuxi section can be navigated by 100-ton small boats all year round, arriving at noon after an early departure. Each boat tows wooden boats to transport coal, just like a train. Currently, since the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway is open to traffic, there are about 70 small boats gathered in the Wuhu area. Once the water becomes shallow in winter, the lines to Wuwei, Xuancheng, and Nanling will be suspended. If the Hefei-Chaoxian County section of the railway is restored earlier, the small boats are very willing to work hard to transport coal. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation recently summoned Xia Shufang, the manager of the Wuhu Merchants Steam Navigation Company (蕪招商局), to inquire about water and land transportation in the Hefei-Yuxi section, and instructed that the postal delivery between Wuhu and Anqing is too slow and ordered the Wuhu shipping industry to quickly fix the liner between Wuhu and Anqing.

### The Resolution of the First Serious Problem: The Grain Storage Movement in Shenyang Shenyang, 20th (Air Mail)

— Special Correspondent, Han Qingtao

The suffering Fanyang, struggling in hardship, seeking survival in desolation, still seems resilient and energetic!

Although the population has decreased from two million to eight hundred thousand, although most of the shops are closed and businesses are suspended, and although fewer people eat noodles and more eat bean dregs and bran, society has become simpler and more stable.

The first serious problem in Fanyang is the grain shortage because there is no source of grain. Air transport is ultimately limited, so how can it support the food for over eight hundred thousand people and five or six large armies—of course, military rations are only a part of it.

Disaster and hardship seem inseparable. In late spring and early summer this year, Fanyang faced a difficult period of grain scarcity, followed by an unprecedented aphid plague in late summer and early autumn. Disaster and hardship are almost inseparable from Fanyang.

The military and political authorities attach great importance to this life-and-death juncture for Fanyang and are very anxious. The provincial and municipal leaders have put all their effort and energy into the "grain problem."

Mayor Dong Wenqi told reporters: "When I returned to the Municipal Government for the second time, grain was my top priority in governance, and other work came second!"

Indeed, he solved the grain crisis in Fanyang this spring during the time of grain scarcity. Now, he is vigorously promoting a city-wide grain storage movement. He said with a smile: "People oppose hoarding, but I am advocating a disguised form of hoarding!"

Of course, his grain storage movement seems to be encouraging citizens to hoard, but everyone should remember that Fanyang's situation is special! The source of grain is difficult! His grain storage movement is precisely aimed at reality and is solving a major problem.

His planned goals and methods are: "Each factory must store at least three months' worth of food for its own use. All mines and factories must go to other counties to purchase grain, or entrust grain merchants and the Municipal Food Allocation Committee to purchase it on their behalf. Another 10,000-person grain purchasing team will be formed, with interest-free loans of 150 gold yuan per person, to be repaid in half a month."

In order to seize the opportunity when the new grain after the disaster is available, factory and mine trucks, merchant carts, citizen pushcarts, bicycles, and grain purchasing teams carrying sacks appear on the small roads and highways of Liaozhong, Xinmin, Faku, Tieling, Liaoyang, and Fushun, a magnificent procession, exerting infinite power.

The grain storage movement is proceeding smoothly. The grain prices in Fanyang market are falling every day, and idle funds are being used for grain, which not only solves most of the grain shortage in Fanyang but also prevents the wave of panic buying of goods that has occurred in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places.

Although the peasants in the surrounding villages can barely maintain enough food to eat, they lack cloth and other daily necessities. This time, the grain purchasing teams have been granted permission to exchange cloth and other daily necessities for grain, thus benefiting both sides greatly, so the effect is significant.

In the past, the layers of checkpoints around Fanyang have greatly hindered the exchange of goods. Some people said, "The fear of gold, silver, and cloth flowing into the bandit areas does not seem to have decreased. For example, in the past month or two, gauze has been indirectly exchanged for apples from the Trade Bureau of the bandit area in Southern Liaoning."

Commander Wei greatly appreciates Mayor Dong's grain storage movement. In addition to accepting Mayor Dong's suggestion to remove the restrictions on the grain purchasing teams at the checkpoints, he also came up with a solution that commercial vehicles in Fanyang must go out to transport grain at least ten times before they can operate in the city.

Recently, military and political officials in Fanyang have been constantly going to the countryside to supervise the concentration of grain, and Fanyang City is also promoting the grain storage movement. As long as Fanyang does not fall, there will be a way for everything in the Northeast. In addition, with the development of the Northeast situation, the prospects are good and the hope is infinite.

### Cotton from Producing Areas Changed to Spinning Native Yarn, Scarcity of Raw Cotton Supply, National Bank Allocates 10,000 Pieces of Yarn to Transport to Producing Areas to Exchange for Cotton

[Our Newspaper News] Cotton trading has been sluggish for a long time. Although the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office is trying its best to collect through finished product swaps, there are many difficulties ahead, and various details are not easy to eliminate. The cotton merchants in this city have repeatedly contacted the Joint Purchasing Association regarding stocks in Shanghai, but because the Joint Purchasing Association has not made a specific decision on the collection of cotton through finished product swaps, they are all waiting and watching. In addition, cotton merchants' stocks in other ports will also be sold locally after the exchange ratio is determined, and the finished products obtained will be used to purchase cotton from the producing areas.

Further News: Since the implementation of economic controls, it has been two months and counting. Because the export of yarn and cloth from this port is restricted, the supply is scarce, and the rural areas desperately need cloth. According to cotton industry news: when new cotton enters the market this year, cotton is not sold everywhere. The peasants believe that the flowers grown in the fields must be sold at the limited price, and the daily necessities they need, such as cloth, soap, and fertilizer, cannot be bought at the limited price in the countryside. Therefore, they are unwilling to sell new cotton, and some of them change to spinning native yarn to weave native cloth and socks. It is heard that in some counties and cities near the cotton-producing areas, there are many native yarn looms on the market, and rural handicrafts are ten times more profitable.

Further News: The Bank has allocated more than 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn to be transported to various cotton-producing areas to exchange for cotton at cost. The detailed measures have been taken to Beijing by Vice President Liu of the National Bank to be submitted to the authorities for approval. Once approved, they can be announced and transported.

### After Implementing the Exchange of Cloth for Rice, a Large Amount of Rice Can Flow In, Yesterday the Supply to the Two Markets Was Even Scarcer

[Our Newspaper News] In recent days, rice arriving at the North and South markets has only been about 1,000 piculs per day, and a large amount has not yet been seen to flow in. However, rice merchants observe that the four types of cloth allocated by the authorities for rice exchange have now been distributed, and each colleague can carry out barter with the producing areas separately, which can greatly alleviate the difficulty of purchasing rice. Also, according to past practice, new rice has been entering the market successively after the Double Ninth Festival. Now that it is the peak season for new rice, it is expected that after the exchange of cloth for rice, a large amount of rice will flow in around the 10th of next month. It is also learned that the situation of difficulties and deductions in the weight when purchasing rice in various places has improved recently. Rice procurement in remote areas, such as Jiangxi and Anhui, is limited due to the lack of train cars. It is heard that in order to solve the difficulty of purchasing rice, the second batch of in-kind exchange for rice will be to allocate rural daily necessities such as soap and sugar to rice merchants for rice exchange.

Further News: The supply of rice yesterday was even scarcer because there was less supply from the producing areas, it was not easy to purchase, and some producing birds were unwilling to let it go. However, with the implementation of the exchange of cloth for rice method, it is expected that colleagues will purchase more enthusiastically, and the supply can be increased immediately. Yesterday, the South Market arrived with a total of 676 piculs, and the North Market arrived with 335 piculs, totaling 1,011 piculs in the two markets.

The trading of miscellaneous grains is watching and waiting before the cost is adjusted and before the exchange with industrial products begins. The allocation of soybeans has been suspended because the exchange method has not been determined, and all transactions are waiting for government regulations to be active.

### No Trading of Sugar

Trading in the sugar market has ceased due to legal restrictions. The guild's allocation has not been implemented, and the subjective wait-and-see attitude has become more firm. The sales of Southern goods stores are fiercely competing for purchases every day. The supply is vast. Although purchases have been restricted in recent days, the quantity is less, and more is purchased. The queues are like long snake formations all day long, starting from queuing in the early morning and not dispersing until closing time. This situation makes it difficult for each store to supply.

### The Tea Market's Foothold is Solid

[Our Newspaper News] According to tea industry sources, the prices of black and green tea varieties in the producing areas, such as Wuyuan, have gradually caught up with those in this city. In addition, the reserves are not very abundant, so the source is becoming increasingly scarce. The re-processing manufacturers in this city believe that the raw tea materials are not easy to add, and because the purchase of all accessories is difficult, they are determined to sell. Although the buyers have a strong appetite, the trading is still narrow, the situation continues to be firm, and the foothold is more solid than before.

### Export Materials Exhausted, the Guild Investigates the Reasons

[Our Newspaper News] Since the implementation of economic controls, export materials have been exhausted. Various materials such as tung oil, tea, silk, bristles, and fur cannot be purchased in the producing areas. The reason is that idle funds have no way out. Those who own funds are hoarding in the producing areas, and the circulation of materials has been blocked. Most of the import and export industries in this city are in a state of stagnation. It is learned that the guild is now investigating the comparison of domestic and foreign market prices of various export materials and the situation of blockage. After the data is collected, it will prepare its opinions and send them to the authorities for adoption.

### Private Traders to Japan Have Profited Greatly in the Last Three Months

Since the start of trading with Japan by private traders in our country, although the government's restrictions are said to be very strict, affecting the development of trade, they have in fact all profited greatly. It is learned that some small-scale private trading firms in this city are operating as agents for customers and trading goods with Japan. They themselves are in the position of intermediaries, using their surplus income to engage in a small amount of direct trading. And after three months of settlement, the net profit has reached more than 6,000 US dollars. This is a miracle in the midst of private traders' requests to the government to relax controls.

### Fangjian Opens Yarn for Sale

Yesterday the cotton yarn market continued to be suspended. Fangjian Company opened yarn for sale as usual, including blue single 20-count Tianguan large package price 700 yuan.

The Cotton Fabric Guild continued to handle the fourth period of the second batch of fabric distribution procedures entrusted by the dyeing and weaving industry at the guild hall at 2 pm yesterday. Each household can still purchase ten bolts, and the fabric numbers eliminated in the first batch of lottery have priority allocation rights today. The types of fabrics distributed in this period include men's and women's colored thread tweed, printed cloth, flannel, bed sheet cloth, and broadcloth, but among them, there are a few white greige fabrics, and the total number of allocations is more than 9,600 bolts.

### Artificial Silk Ordered to Stop Allocation, Remaining Goods are Being Requested for Handling

[Our Newspaper News] The Artificial Silk Business Association has received a notice from the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor's Office believes that artificial silk has been统筹handled by the China Trust Bureau, and the artificial silk market should be closed immediately. The artificial silk raw materials needed by the silk weaving industry are directly allocated by the China Trust Bureau. The association has complied with the order to close the market, but the members have previously supported the national policy and stabilized the price of artificial silk. They have collected inventory and entrusted the association to allocate it at the limited price every day to maintain the needs of various small handicraft industries. During the allocation, the police station sent personnel to monitor. Now that it is ordered to close, all the unallocated inventory includes 18 boxes of 150-count glossy artificial silk, 9 boxes of 120-count glossy artificial silk, 1 box of 75-count matte artificial silk, and about 20 boxes of 120, 150, 100-count various brands of artificial silk stored in the association for daily allocation, and another 156 small packages, all of which have not been allocated. The handling of the above remaining goods is being requested from the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Manufacturers Who Purchased the First Batch of Japanese Reparation Machines Can Pick Up the Goods

It was recently learned from the Shanghai Office of the Committee for Handling Japanese Reparation Materials of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that, as of now, the office has actually received the first batch of Japanese reparation machines, totaling 2,144 boxes of machine tools. Except for 144 boxes of substandard machines, there are about 1,303 units. The companies that have purchased them and picked them up include Yong'an Third Factory, Renli Woolen Mill, Lianggong Machine Factory, and Huadong Coal Mine Company. The companies that are picking them up include Zhengda Textile Factory and Dazhong Porcelain Electric Company. In addition, there are 32 companies that have paid and are waiting to pick them up, and 15 companies that have received payment notices from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Currently, there is a lot of congestion for picking up goods. The office has arranged dates in order of registration for pick-up. Because the cranes and other equipment at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf are seriously insufficient, the office has sent a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to find ways to supplement them in order to expedite the pick-up of goods by the manufacturers.

### Difficulties with Raw Materials for Hardware and Aluminum Products Industries

The Industrial Association's Review is Completed

The Technical Committee of the Industrial Association yesterday continued to announce the difficulties with raw materials for the hardware and aluminum products industries and the urgent need to solve the following methods:

(A) Hardware Industry: The industry's products are numerous and complex, so it needs more types of raw materials. The raw materials that are currently in extremely short supply include brass, copper sheet, copper rod, phosphorus steel wire, foreign yuan Huisi iron, pig iron, iron plate, iron, disc ingot, waste bullet casing, aluminum ingot, bakelite powder, nickel yarn tape, cotton thread, etc. In the past, they were purchased from various firms and manufacturers, and some were imported from abroad. Aluminum and lead were purchased from Taiwan. However, recently, the supply of all raw materials on the market has been almost completely stopped, and there is no way to search for them. Among them, there are also a few raw materials, such as copper sheet, which were previously purchased from the copper and tin industry and now need to be exchanged for waste copper sheet and copper corner. Yarn tape was previously purchased from the ribbon weaving industry, but now it needs to be exchanged for yarn. However, at a time when raw materials are extremely scarce, old materials and exchange items cannot be purchased, so the raw materials for this industry can be said to be completely cut off. In addition, phosphorus copper wire and nickel have long disappeared from the market. If this continues, the future is really unimaginable. It should be resolved as soon as possible to promote development and enable its finished products to be available in the market continuously. The emergency solution is for the Materials Adjustment Committee to order the copper industry, steel industry, ribbon weaving industry, hardware industry, copper and silver industry, and iron industry guilds to supply various raw materials according to the actual needs of each factory.

(B) Aluminum Products Industry: The main raw material needed by the industry is aluminum ingot. The difficulties are as follows: (1) The allocation of foreign exchange is limited and reduced compared to the fourth quarter. (2) Aluminum ingots from Taiwan cannot be supplied as much as possible. Since August 19, 98% of aluminum ingots have not been sold. In addition to requesting the Wheel Management Committee to relax the quota, Taiwan should be requested to ship aluminum ingots to Shanghai as much as possible to supply them.

### Sales of State-Owned Enterprise Stocks Increase in Recent Days

[Our Newspaper News] The sales of state-owned enterprise stocks have improved significantly in recent days.

Among them, Fangjian accounted for the largest share, totaling 3,101,500 yuan, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company 53,000 yuan, Taiwan Sugar 2,052,400 yuan, United Paper 373,800 yuan, and Tianjin Paper the least, only 4,000 yuan.

### Most of the Sixth Season Import Quotas Have Been Allocated

The Seventh and Eighth Seasons Will Be Allocated at Once

[Our Newspaper News] In order to cooperate with the government's measures and accelerate the import of industrial raw materials, the Transportation Control Committee has accelerated the allocation of the sixth season's import quotas. Most of the quotas allocated to importers have been allocated. The parts allocated by the guild have also been allocated to the guilds, which will reallocate them to the member factories. It is heard that the import quotas for the seventh and eighth seasons will be allocated at once to solve the current panic of raw materials for various factories. The allocation work may begin in early next month.

### Refugee Students in Temporary Middle Schools and Joint Middle Schools Lack Winter Clothing, the Ministry of Education Advances Funds to Make and Distribute Clothing and Bedding, Discussing Fundraising and Requesting the Executive Yuan to Allocate Funds

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Education, considering that most of the students fleeing from the bandit areas to various places have established temporary middle schools and joint middle schools, as well as remedial classes for resettlement and schooling.

### Zhang Junmai Lectures on the Philosophical Foundation of Democracy in Chengdu

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 27th] Zhang Junmai lectured on "The Philosophical Foundation of Democratic Politics" to more than a thousand students at Sichuan University on the afternoon of the 26th, saying that after the European Renaissance, the "discovery of man" led to three movements: religious reform, scientific development, and democratic politics, to form modern culture. The credibility of religion, the right and wrong of scientific theories, and the good and evil of politics must have an objective standard, that is, reason. The human rights movement of the 18th and 19th centuries placed too much emphasis on individualism and liberalism. After the industrial revolution, social wealth became uneven, and the promotion of social morality emerged. The early 19th century was the era of rationalism, and the late 19th century was the era of will. Therefore, the philosophical foundation of democratic politics in my mind is "rational will."

### Campus Dynamics: National Chengchi University, Shanghai College of Law and Politics, China Journalism School: Those on the Honor Roll Droop; Fried Dough Sticks are Frail

National Chengchi University: Professor Seiner, chairman of the Department of Political Science at the University of California, USA, is currently studying at the school's Institute of Political Science.

The Office of Academic Affairs recently announced the list of students who failed physical education in the third and fourth grades, totaling more than 120, including 18 female students. Those who "made the honor roll" were all drooping.

Since the "August 19" price limit was implemented, the sesame cakes in the school have become thinner and smaller, and the fried dough sticks are especially "frail." (HL)

Shanghai College of Law and Politics: Since the law students are required to complete 186 credits before graduating, the coursework is very intense. The habit of reading literary books in spare time has greatly decreased recently.

The monthly meal fee in the college cafeteria is only ten yuan, and many people eat there. Recently, there has been a rice shortage, and it is about to run out of rice. It is stipulated that two dou of rice must be paid in advance to have meals in the future. (Li)

China Journalism School: The wall newspaper was full of vigor and vitality in the previous term, but this term only "Genesis" is publishing things that are irrelevant to life and posting them.

Ironically, in a school of journalism, there are no newspapers to read. When students occasionally buy a copy, they snatch it from each other, and it's very popular. (Lv)

### Third Volleyball League Opens Today; Group A: Yongs yarn vs. Xiangfeng

### Wrong Psychology

— Lei Ting

The facts reflected in the authorities' call for thrift are: the special prosperity of restaurants and theaters—everywhere is full, everywhere is full every day!

According to relevant statistics, the tax revenue from banquets and entertainment in September averaged 300,000 gold yuan; this month, up to the 10th, it has reached 200,000 gold yuan, and it is expected that this month's income will be over one million gold yuan. From the perspective of tax revenue, this is a good phenomenon. But from the perspective of why people want to enjoy themselves so frantically, this situation is extremely terrible.

For example, the recent wave of panic buying that has spread throughout the region is believed by some to be the work of scalpers, which cannot be said to be completely without reason. However, the scalpers' actions are only one of several reasons. The main reason is the erroneous psychology of most people.

In the author's humble opinion, the formation of this wrong psychology is: first, of course, the selfishness at work, which is caused by the increase in tobacco tax. Because the increase in tobacco tax has enabled tobacco merchants to obtain double profits out of thin air, general merchants have based on the fact that tobacco tax has increased, thinking that other goods may also increase in price, so they are unwilling to invest in storing goods in order to gain greater profits; the general public, of course, also based on the above point of view, in order to avoid the exploitation of heavy prices, they desperately panic buy. The attitudes of both sides are diametrically opposed, so a man-made phenomenon of demand exceeding supply has been formed, which has caused most daily necessities to have a price but no goods, and thus has constituted a psychological panic for some people.

The soaring increase in entertainment and banquet tax, although there is no such manifestation of form, is also affected by this psychology and fact. For example, because it is difficult for some families to buy food, they simply do not buy it, and all two meals a day are made at restaurants; therefore, the grand situation of queuing to buy meat and queuing to squeeze oil has been found in the vegetable market, and it has also appeared in some restaurants and hotels. This is one of the reasons for the increase in banquet tax revenue.

As for why the business of theaters is so prosperous, I think it is promoted by the following two types of people: one is the numb who "don't care about national affairs." As long as they are warm and well-fed and have surplus money, they will enjoy as much as possible (there are also many of this faction who make the business of restaurants and hotels prosperous). The so-called world situation and the future of the nation are, of course, irrelevant to them. The second are pessimists who have no vision, lack determination, and are decadent. When one thing is not satisfactory, or a situation is not pleasing to the eye, they think that the sky will fall immediately. Therefore, from excitement to decadence, from active to passive, due to decadence and passivity, they blindly embrace the psychology of "drinking today when I have wine" to enjoy themselves wantonly, and euphemistically call it "seeking stimulation." Therefore, a long line of people very naturally becomes an ornament to the theater. This is the reason why entertainment tax has increased.

Of course, the increase in tax revenue is gratifying. But this gratifying thing is built on the contradictory, erroneous, and negative psychology of most people, and this gratifying thing has become terrible again. Because as long as you think about it: we are unfortunately owning so many numb people and decadent people, who hold the psychology that the country and society have nothing to do with themselves or cannot be done, what a sight this is!

Blaming merchants for disregarding morality and blaming citizens for being short-sighted and expanding their selfishness, in today's world of rampant human desires, the result is naturally that "listeners are few," without waiting for divination. Just let it be? Of course, that's not the way to go. Naturally, there is no lack of methods, and the authorities have already formulated them, but the key lies in whether the implementers are serious. Today, we have seen many regulations for stabilizing prices, dredging resources, and implementing thrift. If they can be seriously implemented and the authorities can set an example and achieve the effect of "the upper level setting an example and the lower level following," then the turbulent situation will be clarified. However, this is still a temporary solution. The fundamental solution is how to prevent our next generation from being infected with this despicable, cowardly, and selfish psychology. In a word: how should we teach our next generation?

Some people think that the increase in entertainment and banquet tax is a kind of irony of rigorous thrift, which is just the opposite.

### About Mr. Zhu Guwei

— Meizi

Mr. Zhu Guwei's achievements in ci poetry, as well as his merits, are things that those who study literary history can generally talk about. His anecdotes are also popular. However, some are repeatedly peddled, and it is inevitable that falsehood will be passed on as falsehood. The world has ridiculed those who like to talk about anecdotes, calling them "copper talk," because the source of anecdotes mostly comes from the capital, and they cannot be called "gold" (homophone of Beijing), so they are copper ears.

Mr. Zhu's calligraphy was similar to Chu Suiliang's in his early years. The stone carvings that were written for others, such as the tomb inscription of Chu Jun (Cheng Bo) in Yuhang, were gentle and concise, purely the milk of the Dengshan method. Rubbings still exist today. In his later years, he began to concentrate on Yan Zhenqing's style, seeking Huang Tingjian's "full noon and right disease" from the meaning of "horizontal and vertical." Zhao Ziang’s “right side straight down” was lacking. He transformed his usual practice, and the pen force was biased to the right. At that time, many people imitated it, and he once said: "My calligraphy is not worth learning. Learning it will cause problems. This is what is called overcorrection." According to legend, when Mr. Zhu took the palace examination in the Guangxu Guiwei year (9th year), Chao Yiwen Danchu (Jingming) was in charge of the government, and his son also took the exam in this subject. The examiners must have wanted to make him pass the exam to please him, but there was no way to get through the connection. They only knew that he studied Yan's calligraphy but could not do it well. He got a roll and thought it was him, so he listed it as the first name in the second class (commonly known as Chuanlu). When the sealing was torn open, it was clearly "Zhu Zumou." This statement was quite widely circulated, but the name of the so-called "閤公子" could not be mentioned. Based on Mr. Zhu's calligraphy, it was not until his later years that he changed his old style (learning Chu), so we know that it is inaccurate. Yan Zi, named Jiuzhu, styled Junjie, also styled Chengshu, was also a Jinshi in the Guiwei year. After being dismissed from the museum, he changed to the chief of the Ministry of Rites and rose to the position of Hedong Road in Shanxi. (Zhu Ruzhen, Abridged Dictionary of Words) I once saw him inscribing a rubbing of the Meng Shu Stone Scripture for Sheng Jiang Liu Jianzhi (Tigan) in the Yichou year (the 14th year of the Republic of China). He did not write it himself, but ordered his son Xiaosun to do it for him. Xiaosun's calligraphy also practiced Yan's method, but it was not very good.

Some say that Mr. Zhu concealed his birth date and did not tell anyone, which is also untrue. It involves the false transmission of a certain public affair. (Another matter is also not concealing his birthday.) (Mr. Zhu once engraved a small seal, with the text: "Born one month before Zhu Zhuzha" (Zhu Zhuzha's birthday is August 21st), and often used it. On his sixtieth birthday, Gao Yehou (Shixian) took the meaning of Mengchuang's words and wrote chrysanthemums for his birthday, titled it "Xiangyu Tu", and mounted it as a scroll. The inscriptions of famous people at the time were almost everywhere, and they can be seen in various collections. In his life, he had Wang Rongfu's regret of "being deceived by Xinggong" in his marriage. Even on his deathbed, he still had the sentence "rhinoceros horn in his eyes, cow clothes after death," knowing that his hidden pain was deep. Therefore, he firmly believed in the words of astrologers. Whenever there were those who knew the Bazi art, he would ask them, and if they could determine that his "qin and se were not in tune," he would be very happy and consider them knowledgeable. Therefore, the grassroots who knew a little about ci tunes claimed to be his students, pretended to be the list, and became a laughing stock. For example, in the blank of a certain occultist's ci talk in the Ci Journal in the past, it was said that Mr. Zhu advised against using boxers in the Gengzi year, which angered the Empress Dowager and almost became a continuation of the three loyal ministers (Yuan Chang, Xu Jingcheng, Li Shan). He escaped from the crowd because of his short stature, which was ridiculous. Zhang Mengqu (Ertian) once wrote a letter scolding him severely.

All of the above is irrelevant to the main purpose, and it feels redundant to say it, but I feel that I was born in the same world and saw his face. In less than twenty years, I have sighed at the rumors and different words. Then how can we trust the examination of documents and references? Few anecdotes are not "copper talk." Song people's novels like to talk about anecdotes of famous people at the same time, but they mostly lose their truth. Then we know that ancient and modern are one, and it is not surprising. As for "Biyun (Song people's novel name)" being married to Mei Shengyu, the intention is to attack and slander the Yuanyou partisans, which should be kept but not discussed.

### Buying a Hope

— Qian Dacheng

According to Shanghai newspapers, Douzhen lottery tickets are sold out, and there is even a black market.

How strange! With only 120 winning opportunities out of hundreds of thousands of lottery tickets, people are still rushing to buy them, and their luck is too great. But in all fairness, it is both pitiful and regrettable.

People hoped for victory during the Anti-Japanese War, and after the victory, they hoped for peace in the world. Now that victory has been won for three or three years, peace is still far away. Buying lottery tickets, even though there is only a 120/100,000 chance of winning, there is still a hope after all.

Some people bought lottery tickets, hoping to win the prize soon so that they could realize their hopes. But what about me? If I were to buy one or two lottery tickets, I would hope that the drawing would be postponed as long as possible, because the later the drawing, the longer my hope would be extended; if the drawing is postponed forever, my hope will exist forever. Wouldn't that be great?

### Written on Climbing Mogan Mountain

— Ren Hongjun

I am wandering on Mogan Mountain again. The pines and bamboos are still as secluded as before. A bird's cry gives rise to a sense of coolness, and a few cold flowers herald the early autumn. The ancient temple cannot be expected to survive the disaster, and the bright moon first shines on the top of the mountain. Tomorrow I will use my staff to visit the clouds and visit Zhongmou, the woman in the mountain. (Referring to Mrs. Huang Yingbai)

### Receiving the Obituary of Chen Shulao

— Zheng Wuchang

Lingnan news chokes the autumn soul, not making this person's heaven dark. He was indifferent to fame and fortune and admired the overseas country, and fortunately his bones returned to the fields. The white horse on the border saved the spring appointment (Shulao once promised to visit the White Horse Lake in the spring), and the kapok in the painting recognized the tear stains. Old relatives and friends are falling apart, and I am afraid of passing through the Green Willow Village at sunset.

### Going Out

— Qinghua

I haven't been out for a long time. I took a very short train ride by chance, and then I confirmed that the recent travel boom is really prevalent. The autumn is high and the air is crisp, and there are many people from all countries who go hiking and travel to smoke and haze. Or they are happy to be observed by spies. It is just unlike us who are crammed into a pile in the car, buying first-class tickets and being forced to climb on the foot iron plate with both hands, or shrinking our feet and standing precariously on the "Zhan Tianyou" connecting the two cars. As for the cartels and scalpers, it is simply impossible to talk to them. The situation of us is indeed as I have experienced, and some people have even more bitter experiences. With such travel, it seems that we should also be severely admonished in the future.

But there are still good things about going out. It can let you taste the simplicity and thinness of the folk customs. Let's just say that we had an experience in Suzhou this time. It was already late at night, and we were turned away by three hotels. We wanted to hire a car to Fengmen, but no one was willing to respond. We had to bite the bullet and, after several twists and turns, found a deep alley where my friend Li Gong lived. The door opened, and after asking, I learned that Mr. Li had gone home for the holidays. The neighbor who lived with him actually trusted us and was willing to open the room and let me stay overnight. I am afraid that in Shanghai, ten out of ten families would not be able to do it.

The next morning, my younger brother and I sat in Wu Yuan's "Listening to Rain Pavilion" for a while, and had some snacks. He suddenly had an urgent need to urinate. The two of us dropped our cups and got up, and no one stopped us. I waited on the road until I inquired about a convenient place. I returned after about ten minutes, and the teapot had been refilled. The wooden chair was still empty, and the waiter was not surprised. In Shanghai, they would treat you as if you were eating for free.

It is this, the dilapidated old bridge, the dark and quiet alley, the leisurely comfort, and especially this bit of reasonable human touch, that may make us feel that this place has not completely become a world of beasts.

### Essays

The sale of real estate, such as houses and land, in Ping City (Peiping) has traditionally been of two types: "wealthy" and "urgent funds." "Wealthy" refers to those who have surplus property but lack ready cash, though they are not in dire straits. While they intend to sell, they wait for a good price and are not overly concerned about whether a transaction occurs. "Urgent funds" refers to those who need money immediately (due to funerals or other large expenses), so they dare not speculate and simply aim to sell. However, recently, the number of real estate advertisements in various newspapers has decreased. The few "urgent sales" that do appear usually include the phrase "due to the owner relocating south." This situation implies several things: (1) Those who have real estate, after converting it into liquid assets, cannot find a suitable place to invest it, and also fall into the "reluctant to sell" category, which is why there are fewer properties for sale. (Before the currency reform, rent was calculated in terms of flour sacks, while selling prices were calculated in terms of gold bars. It was openly stated that a ten-room house required thirty-five taels of gold. After the currency reform, gold bars became contraband, and this avenue was closed.) (2) Those who urgently sell their properties do so because the owners are relocating south. The reason for relocating south is the increasingly tense situation in the Northeast and North China. Therefore, although the two mentalities are opposite, the overall cause driving them is the same: the "current situation."

The old capital often had special terms for various "business practices." For example, those who lived off rent were said to "eat roof tiles." Those who made a living by buying and selling secondhand books were said to "eat soft slices" (paper being a soft material). In the late Qing Dynasty, apart from the Manchu-owned mansions, most civilian landlords in Ping City were scribes from various ministries and departments. These people dominated the government offices, manipulating official matters for their own gain. They accumulated considerable wealth and were mostly "old Beijingers," unlike the officials who rotated through positions inside and outside the capital. Thus, they used their money to buy property, providing ample resources for their descendants, who were said to "eat rent," enjoying a generous and stable income, indeed "eating inexhaustibly." After the Republic, the ministry scribes lost power, and property rights gradually fragmented. Most of the mansions of the Manchu nobles passed into the hands of new financial and military magnates. When the national capital moved south in 1928, the populations of political and business circles decreased significantly, and the "roof tile" livelihood suffered a severe blow. At the beginning of the "July 7th" Incident, political circles rushed to the interior, and Ping City became particularly desolate. The Japanese took advantage of this opportunity, occupying or buying vacant houses. Some Koreans and Chinese, relying on the enemy's power, engaged in "roof tile" schemes on a large scale. After a month, as the war spread to villages and towns outside the city, those with some wealth flocked to the city. Enemy nationals and Koreans also arrived in droves, creating a kind of massive "false prosperity." The roof tile business flourished again, but its nature was very different from before. Those buying property were not doing so to invest but to speculate and profit. Landlords either hoarded and extorted rents, or tenants intended to defraud or occupy property. It was completely distorted, with everyone valuing profit above all else. Since the victory, although the enemy has been expelled, the "social ills" they caused are difficult to eradicate quickly. Moreover, with internal troubles arising in the past three years and conflicts occurring in the suburbs, the city's ills have increased rather than decreased. The "roof tile" livelihood is particularly difficult. Renting out empty houses and calculating the value in terms of flour sacks is one method, but "one sack per room" or even half a sack is beyond the ability of tenants to pay. Even if they manage to pay for one or two months, they cannot continue afterward. At that time, the landlord will not receive flour, and if they try to evict the tenant, it is "easy to invite a god but hard to send him away," so they have no choice but to let them live rent-free. If they don't rent it out, not only do they need someone to guard the property, which costs a lot in labor and food, but there is also no doubt that "uninvited guests" (soldiers or bandits) will occupy it, and the owner can do nothing about it.
