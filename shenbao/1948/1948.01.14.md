### Adjusting Salaries for Civil and Military Personnel: The Executive Yuan Approves Implementation Measures, Effective Nationwide from January, Divided into Five Zones

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The six principles for adjusting salaries for civil and military personnel, passed by the 19th State Council meeting, have been put into implementation measures by the Executive Yuan, amended and approved at the 13th Executive Yuan meeting, and will be implemented from January. The content is as follows: (A) The country is divided into five zones in accordance with the principles decided by the State Council. The division is based on the indices compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. Areas with similar indices are classified into the same zone. Within a zone, a compromise index is adopted as the representative index. The difference between the index of each area within the zone and the representative index should not exceed 10,000 times. For example, the representative index for the first zone is 150,000 times, the second zone is 115,000 times, the third zone is 85,000 times, the fourth zone is 65,000 times, and the fifth zone is 52,000 times. Furthermore, due to the special circumstances of Taiyuan and Shenyang, they will be handled separately. They will be included in the general adjustment plan after they return to normal. The base salary for all civil and military officials is 30 yuan, calculated according to the cost-of-living index. Any amount exceeding 30 yuan will be paid at one-tenth of the index. The salaries of technicians and laborers were previously determined independently by each agency before the war and there was no fixed standard. In recent years, they have been paid at 60% of the base amount. Now that the base amount has been abolished, salary scales for technicians and laborers of each agency will be formulated, divided into seven grades to match seniority and work ability, and salaries will also be paid according to the index. Those below 30 yuan will be paid according to the index, and those exceeding 30 yuan will be paid at one-tenth of the index. The treatment of police officers will still be in accordance with existing regulations. Police chiefs will receive 30 yuan, and a certain amount calculated at 70% of the index. Police officers will receive 60%. Police chiefs in the six special municipalities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Qingdao will receive 90%, and police officers will receive 80%. The salaries of police chiefs and officers will be in accordance with the current salary scales for police chiefs and officers. For salary amounts exceeding 30 yuan, the amount exceeding 30 yuan will be paid at one-tenth of the index. (B) Due to the greater mobility of military officers and soldiers, their salaries were originally uniform nationwide. Officers were generally calculated according to the second zone standard, which was one level lower than the Nanjing zone. This time, it has been changed to be calculated according to the representative index of the capital Nanjing zone, which is an increase of 150% compared to the original salary. Soldiers will also be increased by 150%, the same percentage as officers. (C) The treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises (including national banks and bureaus) should strictly comply with the "Regulations on the Treatment of Personnel in State-Owned Enterprises." The total income of all allowances, including basic salary, cost-of-living allowance, special office expenses, food and lodging allowances, and the difference in kind distribution, shall not exceed 30% of the income of corresponding levels of public school personnel (including salary, cost-of-living allowance, special office expenses, and the difference in kind distribution in areas where kind distribution has been implemented). If there is a surplus at the end of the year, year-end bonuses may be issued, with the approval of the competent authority, in accordance with the "Regulations on the Issuance of Bonuses to Employees of State-Owned Agricultural, Industrial, and Mining Enterprises," up to a maximum of three months' salary. In addition, there shall be no extra treatment. The competent authority should effectively supervise implementation. (D) The "Implementation Measures for Transferring Surplus Salaries and Cost-of-Living Allowances of Various Agencies for Employee Welfare Purposes" will be abolished from January 1948. In the future, any surplus salaries and cost-of-living allowances from various agencies will still be turned over. (E) The special subsidies for faculty and staff of specialized schools and above in zones other than the first zone have been decided by the 19th meeting of the State Council in the general budget for the first half of 1948. They will be abolished after the revision of the "Measures for Adjusting the Salaries of Civil and Military Personnel" from January 1948. The original budget has also been deleted, and should be cancelled. (F) For civil service agencies, staff members and laborers (excluding technicians and police); for military agencies, officers and soldiers in rear agencies and troops, the total amount due should be reduced by 5% per month from February 1948 until June, when the cost-of-living allowance should be reduced by 25%. Each agency should independently plan and implement how to streamline its organization, merge institutions, or lay off redundant personnel, and report to the Executive Yuan for approval. Employees and laborers (excluding technicians) of state-owned enterprises should also be reduced according to the above standards, and the competent authorities should be responsible for submitting a list to the Executive Yuan in early each month. Late submissions will result in the suspension of subsidies. (G) Provinces and cities may adjust the treatment of civil, military, and labor personnel with reference to the central government's standards. If financial resources are truly insufficient, the central government will provide appropriate subsidies, and the measures for tightening expenses should be consistent with the central government's regulations.

### Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu Belong to the Third Zone, with an Index of 85,000 Times

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] After the "Implementation Measures for Adjusting the Treatment of Public Servants" were approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 13th, it was announced that the country would be divided into five zones. The first zone is Dihua in Xinjiang, 150,000 times; the second zone is Beiping, Tianjin, and Hebei, 115,000 times; the third zone is Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu, 85,000 times; the fourth zone is Hankou, Guangzhou, South China, and Central China, 65,000 times; and the fifth zone is Chengdu, Chongqing, Sichuan, and other places, 52,000 times. As for Shenyang and Taiyuan, due to their special circumstances, they are temporarily listed as special zones, calculated at 200,000 times. Furthermore, President Zhang Qun stated in the political affairs meeting today regarding the adjustment of the treatment of public school personnel: the government is determined to consider the stability of the lives of public school personnel and adjust their treatment. He hopes that public school personnel across the country can appreciate the government's hard work and jointly seek strategies for suppressing the rebellion and building the country. It is also heard that the total amount of expenditures increased due to the adjustment of treatment reaches 12 trillion yuan per month, accounting for the largest figure in the government's income.

### The Chinese Government and Public Deeply Express Outrage at the Unfortunate Incident in Kowloon City; Guo Dehua Lodges Another Protest with the Hong Kong Government

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Supervisors Li Xiaoting, Li Zhengle, Wang Pingzheng, Wang Shuhui, Bai Rui, Huang Fengchi, and others, believe that the Hong Kong government dispatched armed police to drive out residents of the area, forcibly demolish houses, and injure many people, which is a violation of the treaty. They have suggested that the government immediately lodge a serious protest with the British government and immediately take effective measures to protect the residents of the area.

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] When the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council met on the 13th, some councilors expressed their opinions on the Kowloon City incident. It was then decided that the secretariat would invite representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend the meeting on the 14th to report.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 13th] Guo Dehua, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, lodged a protest with Hong Kong Governor Grantham today regarding the Hong Kong police injuring Chinese residents in Kowloon City. He also requested that no more police be sent into the city during the negotiations.

[Another Dispatch] The Hong Kong court today sentenced Kowloon residents Zhu Peitang and Liu Yifu to three months of hard labor each for inciting the masses to resist the demolition of houses.

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] Regarding the Kowloon City demolition incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made no further comments on the 13th, only stating, "Our position has been clearly stated in the protest letter on the 8th and in the two protest actions themselves. We sincerely hope that the British side will instruct the Hong Kong government to cease any compulsory actions as soon as possible and seek a solution through diplomatic channels." The British Embassy is also paying close attention to Foreign Minister Wang's stern protest on the 12th and has immediately reported to the London government. It is reported that Ambassador Stevenson is deeply troubled by the Hong Kong side's further escalation of the situation. When our reporter discussed this issue with Embassy Secretary Ban An on the 13th, he described the reports he received from the Hong Kong government in his capacity as a spokesperson. He did not deny that this was a regrettable incident and said that the embassy was awaiting instructions from London and hoped that the matter could be resolved quickly. When the reporter asked whether the British government had considered returning the leased territory of Kowloon to China, he replied with a smile that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had only notified the British government in the spring of 1943 when the new Sino-British treaty was signed, stating that it reserved the right to recover Kowloon, but had not yet raised the issue for negotiation. Mr. Ban said that the point of contention in the Kowloon City incident was the difference in the interpretation of the treaty clauses. Mr. Ban was ordered on the 13th to go to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate on this matter. (Reactions to the Kowloon City incident from various places are published on page two)

### Beiping Officially Designated as a Secondary Capital by Order of the National Government

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The National Government orders that Beiping, with its majestic scenery, controls mountains and seas, connects Songliao, and embraces Hebei, is rich in resources, and has access to all directions by sea. Its customs and culture inherit the essence of past dynasties and are admired by the entire country. Since the Northern Expedition, the government has established its capital in Nanjing. Considering the situation, it still regards Beiping as an important town, reorganizes and manages it, sparing no effort. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the country is united. The government is about to continue suppressing internal turmoil and seek construction. The key to the northern gate is of great concern. It is appropriate to plan ahead and expand the system in accordance with the times. Therefore, Beiping is officially designated as a secondary capital. The Executive Yuan is instructed to supervise the competent authorities to consider the current and past situations, make proper plans, and implement them separately, to highlight the achievements and create new regulations. This is the order.

### Opening of the Army Training Conference; The Chairman Personally Presides and Gives Sincere Instructions; The Conference Lasts Three Days and Will Draft a New Training Plan

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The Army Headquarters convened the Army Training Conference, which officially opened in Nanjing on the 13th. The conference is scheduled to last for three days and close on the 15th. Participants include senior generals from the Army Headquarters, the Army Training Command, the Ministry of National Defense, and responsible persons from military schools, including Sun Liren, Guan Linzheng, Huang Wei, Jiang Jingguo, Tang Enbo, Guo Chan, Lin Wei, Liu Fei, and Xu Sipeng. When the opening ceremony was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, Chairman Chiang personally presided and gave sincere instructions on the heavy responsibility of suppressing the rebellion, building the country, and building the army on the spot. The morning meeting was for officials of various units to present reports, and the afternoon was for group review, divided into three groups. The first group was new recruit training, convened by Sun Liren, the second group was officer training, convened by Tang Enbo, and the third group was special forces training, convened by Jiang Jingguo. It is heard that the purpose of this conference is to exchange opinions in order to propose a new training plan as a guideline for future training of officers and soldiers. When formulating this plan, special attention will be paid to past training experience, and the training results of the US military will also be referenced. The opinions of the US military advisory group will also be respected. At noon on the 13th, Tang Enbo hosted a banquet for the senior generals attending the meeting. At 7:00 p.m., Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet for Sun Liren, Tang Enbo, Guan Linzheng, Huang Wei, Jiang Jingguo, etc. at his official residence and gave further military instructions.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] Authoritative sources revealed that the Army Training Conference decided today to establish five new recruit training centers in the country to cultivate fresh troops for the National Army to suppress the rebellion. These five training centers will be established in Beiping, Shenyang, Hankou, Chongqing, and Xi'an. General Tang Enbo is responsible for the training plan. It is planned to train ten reserve divisions in each training center. These training centers are different in nature from the current trainee training center in Taiwan. The latter's main purpose is to develop and train the use of modern weapons and refine amphibious combat troops. At today's Army Training Conference, Chairman Chiang emphasized the importance of training troops for suppressing the rebellion. During his recent inspection of the front lines, he found that the training of the National Army was lacking, and troops who were not trained and skilled were often sent to the front lines, which caused the National Army to suffer setbacks before the battle. It is also learned that the Army Training Conference also discussed the plan to reorganize the New First Army and the New Sixth Army into the New Seventh Army.

### Ensuring the Northeast; The Abandonment Theory is Absolutely Not True

[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] It is revealed here that among the key points emphasized by Chairman Chiang during the military conference he presided over in Shenyang last weekend included repairing the railway south of Shenyang and protecting the corridor between Liaoning, Rehe, and Chahar at all costs. These reports can overturn the rumors prevalent in the Northeast and North China that the National Army will withdraw from the Northeast. At the meeting in Shenyang, the Chairman also advocated sending strong National Army troops to the area north of Lushun and Dalian to isolate the large number of communist troops concentrated there.

[Our Beiping Office, 13th] The spokesperson of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters today denied the rumors that the military affairs inside and outside the pass would be under the unified command of Fu Zuoyi. Mr. Fu had not heard anything about this during his trip to Shenyang.

[Our Shenyang Office, 13th] It snowed again on the night of the 12th, and the sound of artillery fire was heard again. A certain cavalry brigade of the National Army drove away the assembled bandits on the north and south banks of the Hun River, 20 kilometers southwest of Shenyang, near Mojiapu and the outer perimeter of Panjiantai. The bandits defended with artillery fire, and the fighting subsided at dawn. Also, a loud explosion occurred near Shilihe Station, ten miles south of Shenyang, on the night of the 12th. The bandits tried to destroy the railway bridge but were repelled. There was no major contact on either side of the Liao River.

The meeting was then adjourned, and it was decided that the group review would be held on the morning of the 14th and the comprehensive review would be held in the afternoon. Also, the total amount of the budget submitted for discussion today, which had been previously passed by the State Council, was 90 trillion, and it was balanced in terms of revenue and expenditure.

### Confirmation That Three Foreign Female Missionaries Were Killed by Bandits – Missionaries in Bandit Areas to Be Evacuated on a Large Scale

[Report from Our Newspaper] The news that two American female missionaries and one Finnish missionary were killed by bandits has been confirmed yesterday. Among the two American female missionaries, one was Ms. Anderson from Minneapolis, USA, and the other was Ms. Nordon from Chicago. The Finnish missionary was a doctor named Baker from Helsinki. All three were killed during a journey on the Henan-Hubei Highway. According to eyewitnesses: it is believed that the murderers must be the Communist bandits, because when they committed the crime, they shouted, "You are Americans, Americans should die." Two Chinese who were traveling with them were also killed at the same time because they tried to dissuade them. After the news spread, the Church has expressed deep concern about the safety of missionaries in the future. In order to prevent such incidents from happening again, it has been decided to evacuate missionaries from the bandit areas on a large scale, with an estimated number of about 200 people. The Lutheran Church (the American Mission Board of the United Lutheran Church in America belongs to this church) owns the "St. Paul" transport plane, which will be used as a means of evacuation. Mr. Nelson, the person in charge of the church, has gone to Wuhan at the request of the American Consulate in Shanghai to arrange everything. The "St. Paul" has now flown to Chongqing and Lanzhou. Once the normal transportation work is completed, it will go to Laohekou on the 15th of this month to carry out the work of withdrawing the missionaries. (Continued on page 2, column 2)

### Marshall Announces in the House of Representatives That the US Will Propose Aid to China Plan Immediately – Bei Zuyi and His Party Leave Shanghai for the US Today

[US Information Service, Washington, 12th] At a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary of State Marshall reiterated his support for the European Recovery Program and promised to propose an aid to China plan as soon as possible. In response to Bloom's inquiry, Marshall said that he would submit a proposal for aid to China before the discussion of the European Recovery Program is concluded. Secretary Marshall added that aid to China is outside of the European Recovery Program. Although Secretary Marshall did not specify the amount of aid to China, he said that aid to China will be implemented soon.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] US Secretary of State Marshall announced to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the evening of the 12th that the Chinese government has notified the State Department to request more financial assistance.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] As a result of President Truman's conversation with Marshall, US aid to China seems likely to be determined. However, some Chinese officials now express deep concern that US aid may not meet their desired goals. They believe that Marshall's statement that aid to Europe "must be sufficient, otherwise it is equal to zero" is also very applicable to China. If aid to China is not enough to cope with the reform of the currency system and to overwhelm the Communist bandits, then all aid is a waste.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Bei Zuyi is scheduled to take a Pan American Airlines flight to the United States this afternoon with Hong Shen, the assistant of the Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, and Zhu Baozhen, the English secretary. Last night, Thomas, the manager of the Shanghai branch of Citibank, hosted a special banquet for Bei, and many of the leading figures in the Chinese and American financial circles were invited to attend. During Bei's three days in Shanghai, he had extensive contact with leaders in the financial community, who provided some information for Bei to take to the United States, but no new proposals were heard. Before this, Bei also met with many leaders of American businesses. Bei is scheduled to stay in the United States for two months, and after returning to China to report on his duties, he will go to the United States again to carry out his mission.

Editorial

### Starting with the Murder of American Female Missionaries

According to a report from the United Press in Hankou on the 13th: "American female missionaries Anderson and Nott and Finnish missionary Dr. Berg were brutally murdered by Communist bandits last week, 150 miles northwest of Hankou. Foreign church workers in the war zone will be evacuated on a large scale. According to eyewitnesses, the Communist bandits shouted, 'You are British, Americans deserve to die,' before shooting and killing the three American female missionaries and the Finnish doctor; two Chinese who tried to dissuade them were also shot and killed." After reading the United Press report, we were filled with many feelings and did not know where to begin. Let us put everything else aside and, standing solely from a humanitarian standpoint, we cannot help but express our indignation at the Communist bandits' inhumane atrocities.

First, it is a great misfortune for our nation that our country has encountered the Communist bandits' rebellion after the victory of the War of Resistance. And some self-proclaimed liberals, knowing that the Communist bandits are a depraved and inhumane rebel party, still treat them as ordinary political parties in Europe and the United States. Not only do they not actively participate in the government's important work of suppressing the rebellion, but they also stand idly by, and even sometimes add fuel to the fire. The Communist bandits have become rampant to this point, and the self-proclaimed liberals cannot escape their responsibility. We often see in newspapers and magazines texts recording the Communist bandits' atrocities and wanton slaughter of ordinary people. When we ask the self-proclaimed liberals about this, they either defend the Communist bandits or say that it is the government's propaganda offensive. I wonder what they think of this news? And how will they defend the Communist bandits this time? The Communist bandits' hideous faces have long been exposed. The self-proclaimed liberals should finally wake up! Why do they still speak for the inhumane rebel party?

Second, the Communist bandits' anti-American atrocities are no different from the Boxers who caused the Eight-Nation Alliance fifty years ago. This kind of blind xenophobic movement, no matter from which angle you observe it, is harmful and useless to the country and the nation, and to the world and mankind. China has made considerable progress in all aspects after forty-eight years of internal and external troubles. The Boxers who advocated "Support the Qing, destroy the foreigners" should never be allowed to be reborn today. The Communist bandits have always claimed to be progressive elements, but they are doing this kind of anti-era atrocity. The Communist bandits themselves are not to be regretted, but we cannot help but feel sad for the future of the Republic of China!

Third, the Communist bandits have been launching anti-American movements for a long time. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communist bandits were unable to achieve their ambition to contend for surrender, so they vented their anger on the United States, shouting the slogan "Down with American imperialism" in the bandit areas and inciting others to oppose American aid. What is their intention? It is self-evident. The Communist bandit Mao Zedong also issued a statement on December 25 last year, saying that "The United States is now interfering in the revolutionary war," and severely criticized the US government. We ultimately believe that the Communist bandits' anti-Americanism will not indiscriminately put innocent American female missionaries on the list of "Down with." But now, in fact, the Communist bandits' slogan is "You are Americans, Americans deserve to die." This kind of blind anti-American atrocity cannot be found a second example in modern countries.

Fourth, the United States, both the government and the public, have recently had a more accurate understanding of the Chinese Communist bandits, but they have not fully understood them clearly. In the past, most Americans thought that the Communist bandits were a revolutionary political party that advocated land reform, so Secretary of State Marshall initially wanted the US government to expand its foundation and establish a democratic government that included the Communist bandits. Only later did he realize that it was impossible for the Communist bandits to join the government. Now, seeing the murder of American female missionaries, we can better recognize the Communist bandits' hideous faces. In the past, American news reporters often came to China to interview, and they were often deceived by the Communist bandits and could not see the truth. We told them about the Communist bandits' atrocities, but they were mostly skeptical, thinking that the Communist bandits would not commit such heinous atrocities. But now, the fact that American female missionaries have been killed is placed before the eyes of the world. Can you still not believe it?

In short, the incident of American female missionaries being murdered by Communist bandits not only exposes the Communist bandits' hideous and ugly faces, but is also a satire of the United States' China policy in the past year. We want the American government and the public to understand that the anti-American movement of the Chinese Communist bandits is already raging and cannot be stopped. To investigate why they are so bold and reckless, and inflict heinous atrocities on American female missionaries, there is indeed an international background. Therefore, if the United States wants to maintain peace and stability in the Far East, and if it wants to maintain its position in the Far East, it should immediately provide comprehensive assistance to the Chinese government, which is currently struggling to suppress the rebellion, without any further hesitation.

### The Turmoil in the Balkans

Since the Balkan Alliance (composed of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Albania) was established in December of last year, the Balkan Peninsula, which has been known as the "powder keg of Europe" in modern history, has become a "miniature world," reflecting the white-hot struggle between the two major blocs, which is more serious than in any other corner of the world. And in addition to Romania, where the situation is already tense, the winds over the Mediterranean are suddenly becoming turbulent, with a great sense of impending storm. Among the many news dispatches from news agencies around the world, the ones that are particularly noteworthy are the following: After Greek guerrilla leader General Markos organized the "Greek Free Government" in northern Greece, he will request to formally join the new European Communist International, attempting to obtain unlimited military assistance from the communist parties; The United States recently transferred submarines and other warships to Turkey to strengthen its defense of the Dardanelles Strait, thereby preventing the communist labor force from infiltrating the Mediterranean; The British Mediterranean Fleet will conduct naval exercises in the Ionian Sea southwest of Greece; The rumor that the United States will intervene militarily in the Greek civil war is rampant. Just from these four things alone, the seriousness of the European situation is self-evident.

The breakdown of the London Four Foreign Ministers Conference, although it brought 1947 to an end in a bleak atmosphere, still left the general public with some optimism about the arrival of 1948, hoping that the coming year would bring a "light at the end of the tunnel." But in the first few days of this year, what we saw in the world was a scene of preparing for a major war everywhere; what we heard were rumors of an "inevitable war between the US and the Soviet Union"; at the very beginning of 1948, when the so-called "a year's plan lies in spring," was filled with these ominous reports, it was really an omen that we humans are about to encounter another catastrophe, making even the people who have the most confidence in world peace dare not be blindly optimistic. The crisis in the Balkans is enough to create a source of turmoil in the world. People around the world should be particularly vigilant about this, especially international politicians and diplomats who are responsible for the safety of the world. They should have a high vision and a far-sighted view, use their political knowledge to prevent problems before they arise, and first sweep away the haze that is shrouding the Mediterranean sky, so as to project the sunshine of peace and stability.

When people comment on the world situation, they all say that the post-war world has reached the end of its rope, and that there is no hope of resolving either the Far East problem or the European stalemate; but when we observe the direction of the world situation and study the root causes of all international problems, we deeply know that opening up the overall world situation is not an absolutely impossible special thing; in other words, as long as the powers that control the fate of today's world can have a thorough understanding and take the peace and stability of the world as the most important thing, and put the interests of their own country in a secondary position, then the divided world can be "reunited," and all the international problems that have occurred after the war can be easily solved. Therefore, the crux of the world's problems lies in the selfishness of the great powers, who cannot tolerate and concede to each other, thus creating an incompatible situation between the two major blocs; this is even more true in the small world of the Balkans. Whether the current tense situation can be eased depends entirely on the hands of the United States and the Soviet Union. As long as the United States and the Soviet Union can dispel their suspicions and repair their relationship, the wind and clouds over the Mediterranean can immediately dissipate. At the same time, we stand on the position of a third party, and we also hope that the people of the United States and the Soviet Union will base their actions on the ideals of world peace and universal justice, because conflict is harmful and useless to both sides. Based on this understanding, it can be known that differences in thinking are not enough to hinder cooperation between the two sides, and even conflicts of interest will not lead to the two sides immediately meeting each other with soldiers. People's confidence in world peace will also be greatly increased.

The victory of World War II can be said to be the result of the sincere cooperation of the five major powers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Since the war camp was able to work together under the principle of "victory first," it is natural that they can also work together under the principle of "peace first" after the war. But why has the situation in the two and a half years since the victory gone against our ideals? The main reason for this cannot but be blamed on the United States and the Soviet Union, who are vying for world leadership. Since the end of the victory of the war, both the United States and the Soviet Union have called for "peace" and "cooperation," and have repeatedly held international conferences to clean up the mess in the post-war world; but both sides only know how to plan for themselves and cannot see the big picture and think about the entire world. Therefore, both sides have opposite opinions on any international issue. Although the world also hopes that the United States and the Soviet Union can seek the big picture from small differences, the opinions of both sides are becoming more and more distant. The Iranian issue in the Near East was able to obtain a barely satisfactory solution, but the stalemate in the Greek problem has not been resolved, allowing it to become a source of turmoil in the Balkans. By February and March of last year, the Greek situation became increasingly serious, forcing President Truman to issue an urgent appeal to Congress, requesting Congress to allocate $400 million to aid Greece and Turkey to resist the intrusion of external forces. The so-called Truman Doctrine was born, causing a serious reaction from the Soviet Union, which not only adopted an uncompromising attitude towards the United States, but also actively carried out anti-American movements internationally, bringing US-Soviet relations to the stage of close contact. Later, in order to ease US-Soviet relations, Marshall proposed the European Aid Plan, putting the Soviet Union on the list of "recipient countries." Although the intention was good, the Soviet Union not only refused to accept it, but also led other countries to oppose it, on the one hand with the so-called "Molotov Plan" to confront the Marshall Plan; on the other hand, it launched a new Communist organization to launch the "anti-American" and "anti-aid" movements in order to consolidate the Soviet Union's position in Europe. From then on, Europe was divided into two, and there was no longer any possibility of compromise. The failure of the London Foreign Ministers Conference is an ironclad proof. Now the US Congress is discussing the long-term European Aid Plan, and at the same time is actively promoting the Truman Doctrine in Greece and Turkey. The Soviet Union's counterattack in the Balkans is also an inevitable result.

In short, the turmoil in the Balkans and the turbulent situation in the Mediterranean can be said to be the superficialization of the US-Soviet conflict. The only way to open up the European situation is to restore the previous good relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and restore the spirit of sincere cooperation during the war. Otherwise, no matter how the United States says that aiding Europe and stabilizing the economy can avoid war, or how the Soviet Union says that the anti-American motive comes from peace, the result of each going its own way will inevitably lead to a new war!

### National Army in Jinxi Recovers Yuncheng – The War Situation in Yuxi Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse with Land and Air Coordination – Bandits in the Dabie Mountains Carry Tools for Destroying Roads from a Certain Source

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 13th] The elite troops of the National Army in Jinan recovered Yuncheng on the 12th in one fell swoop. The remnants of the He bandits who had been harassing the area fled north on horseback, and the National Army is pursuing them. The remnants of the bandits in the area south of Yuncheng to Pinglu have gradually been wiped out.

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 13th] More than 20,000 of Chen Geng's bandits and Liu Bocheng's remnants, who had invaded Deng County in Yuxi, had not stopped their offensive as of the 13th. However, after repeated fierce attacks, they were repeatedly repulsed by the heroic resistance of the local forces. The National Army and local forces reinforcing from Neixiang have arrived, and the strength of the defending forces has greatly increased. The air force has also been dispatched to help, and the situation will take a sharp turn for the worse within days.

[Report from Our Newspaper in Zhengzhou, 13th] All bandits northeast of Xuchang have been driven away, and most of the bandits south of Xuchang have also been defeated and retreated south. Chen Shaomin's remnants of the 8th Column are fleeing south of Suixian. The 11th Column of bandits who had previously attacked Heze have retreated to the Dingtao and Caoxian areas. More than 10,000 bandits who had fled from the north bank of the Yellow River are building fortifications on the outer edge of Heze.

[Central News Agency, Xinyang, 13th] The bandits in the Dabie Mountain area have been frequently mobilized recently. It is reported that Liu Bocheng intends to disrupt the Pingjin Railway section of the Xinyang-Hankou line. The bandits' 10th Column recently gathered more than 10,000 people at Siwang Mountain west of the road, and carried with them two railway destruction tools that a certain party had used in the European battlefield, in order to implement the so-called "Great Railway Turnaround" destruction policy. The bandits' 2nd and 6th Columns are also moving from the eastern edge of the Henan-Hubei border area to the west. The bandits' 1st Column has the appearance of fleeing south on both sides of the Huai River.

### The Ordeal of the Female Missionaries

(Continued from page 1)

According to the oral account of the survivors who were traveling with them, they and the three missionaries who were killed were traveling on a highway bus from Xinyang in Henan Province to Ezhou. On the afternoon of the 7th, when they were 30 miles away from Jingmen, the highway bus was suddenly stopped by more than 50 bandits. All the passengers were ordered to leave the bus. After the three missionaries left the bus, the bandits shouted, "You are Americans, Americans deserve to die." Because Baker did not declare that she was Finnish, she was shot and killed by the bandits first. The bandits then raised their guns directly at the two female missionaries. Two Chinese who were traveling with them bravely stepped forward to dissuade them and were shot and killed first. The two female missionaries then died. The rest of the passengers were released. At present, the bodies of the three missionaries have been found and put in coffins, and it has been decided to transport them to Hankou for burial in accordance with the rituals. The above is the general situation of the ordeal of the three missionaries.

Church Measures

After this unfortunate incident, the American Consul in Hankou, Bacon, once again advised American citizens to leave the dangerous areas of Henan and Hubei. At the same time, church officials also urgently telegraphed foreign workers in Central China, instructing them to evacuate to safe areas immediately. At present, two evacuation stations have been established in the area, one in Laohekou, which was besieged by the Communist army the week before and where 20 Americans and 40 Norwegians have been gathered; the other is in Zhengzhou, where the 100 staff members of the church hospital will be evacuated first, and the foreign missionaries concentrated in Zhengzhou from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway will be evacuated in the second step. Various methods are being devised to transport them out. Mr. Nelson has clearly announced that during the evacuation, no distinction will be made between Catholics and Protestants, and that all will be treated equally and airlifted on the "St. Paul." According to the estimates of Mr. Nelson and other church officials, there are more than 500 foreign missionaries trapped in bandit areas and dangerous areas, of whom nearly 200 have been concentrated in Hankou, where the church's support for them has gradually become a problem.

Missionary Reactions

After the news of the ordeal of the three missionaries was confirmed yesterday afternoon, reporters visited several church organizations. Some church officials believed that the initiators of the forced evacuation of 6,000 foreign missionaries from China in 1927 were the Communist Party. The methods adopted by the Communist bandits today are no different from those in the past. Reporters also met Mr. Hanson, a missionary who evacuated to Shanghai from Xuchang. When talking about the attitude of the Communist bandits towards the missionaries, he said that on the surface, there was no obvious anti-Americanism. For example, when Xuchang was occupied, there was not a single anti-American slogan on the walls of the church buildings, nor was there any act of harming the missionaries. However, between words and sentences, the anti-American color was naturally revealed. When they first occupied Xuchang, they allowed "protection of the lives, property, and freedom of missionaries," but in fact, Communist bandit soldiers often entered the houses and destroyed the equipment and facilities in the residences, and there were incidents of demanding clothes, watches, etc.

### Ye Chucang's Coffin Is Buried

[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou, 13th] The coffin of the late Mr. Ye Chucang, a member of the National Government and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, was moved from the mourning hall in Zhongshan Hall in the city this morning and sent directly to the cemetery at the southern foot of Lingyan Mountain in Mudu. The coffin was lowered into the tomb at 2:15 pm. National Government Chairman Chiang's representative Shao Lizi, representatives of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee Ju Zheng, and Chen Lifu, Wang Maogong, Wu Tiecheng, Niu Yongjian, Zhang Lisheng, Hong Lanyou, Qian Dajun, Di Ying, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, and others rushed to the tomb to pay their respects. The memorial ceremony ended at about 4:00 pm. This generation of great figures of the party and the country will henceforth sleep forever under the spiritual land of Lingyan in Wuzhong! Mr. Ye's cemetery covers an area of 25 acres and is planted with green pines and cypresses everywhere. The mountains are spiritual and the water is beautiful. A memorial pavilion and stele have been built in the center of the cemetery. It is heard that Mr. Ye's family has decided to engrave the Central Commendation Order on stone to serve as a permanent memorial.

### Karen's Visit to Shanghai and Discussions

(Continued from page one) Lord Karen's primary mission in Southeast Asia is to liaise with neighboring countries on food matters. When asked about the current food supply situation, he stated: it has improved compared to before. Although the output of the three major grain-producing countries in Southeast Asia—Siam, Burma, and India—is far lower than in the past after the war, he personally is not pessimistic. Mr. Karen continued, the transportation systems in various grain-producing countries have been severely damaged by the war, which has affected production. According to the estimation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization at a conference in India, it will take five years for the grain-producing countries to restore to the same level of production as before the war. Currently, various countries in Southeast Asia are implementing a rationing system. People in Malaya are given only four and a half ounces of rice per day. Although they can obtain flour, they are constrained by habit and are unwilling to eat flour, so the demand for rice is even greater. Most of China's food relies on Siam, shipped monthly from Bangkok. Recently, the United Nations member states organized a Food Liaison Committee, which holds meetings monthly to discuss food issues. Mr. Karen is the chairman of the committee. The first general meeting of the Liaison Committee was held on the sixth of this month, and the results were quite satisfactory. During the meeting, representatives from various countries were open and honest, assisting each other, using surpluses to help those in need, making everyone feel optimistic.

According to reports, Mr. Karen came to China in June 1936 at the invitation of Song Ziwen, the former President of the Executive Yuan, to discuss China's food problem.

The reporter then asked whether it was true that people in Southeast Asia were repelling overseas Chinese. Mr. Karen immediately replied that although this matter was not within his scope of duties, he was certain that there was absolutely no such thing during his tenure there. Not only was there no anti-Chinese sentiment, but the opposite was true. Mr. Karen repeatedly stated, "I can absolutely vouch for this." He also expressed his deep love for China and frequently praised the comfort and enjoyment of his trip to Shanghai on the China National Aviation Corporation's "Overlord" plane.

### Difficulties in the Work of the Military Discipline and Administration Supervisory Group, Spokesman Hopes for an Early End

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The spokesman for the Ji, Ping, and Tianjin Military Discipline and Administration Supervisory Group stated today: Since its establishment, the group has consistently faced financial difficulties. Moreover, being in a position of inspection and supervision, the group has encountered numerous difficulties in promoting its work. Its functions are easily confused with those of the supervisory and judicial authorities, inevitably inviting external criticism. Currently, North China is the only region in the country with such an organization, and its work is becoming increasingly difficult. It is hoped that the supervisory group will be terminated soon. Today, the speakers of the three councils of Ji, Ping, and Tianjin, who are also members of the group, flew to Beijing to decide whether the work of the supervisory group will be terminated by the central government.

Since 1933, the Hong Kong government has issued orders forcing Kowloon City residents to relocate three times. This time, it resorted to forceful demolition, which is a complete violation of the agreement.

It is said that Hoges C. Straite, the director of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, who sought a 400 million dollar loan in the United States, returned to The Hague last week empty-handed. According to this information, Hoges C. Straite's mission failed due to the United States adopting a new policy on the Indonesian dispute.

[United Press, Batavia, 12th] A United Nations delegation is now working intensively in the Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta, to prevent the resumption of the Indonesia-Netherlands war at noon on the 13th. The US representative, Mr. Proude, accompanied by the Australian representative and four senior Indonesian leaders, flew to Yogyakarta yesterday on a US military aircraft to make a last-minute effort to maintain peace. A new emergency situation has been created because the Dutch side demanded that Indonesia issue a ceasefire order along the demarcation line designated by the Dutch side before noon on the 13th. Observers fear that if Indonesia refuses, a new war will break out. It is learned that the United Nations delegation is gently persuading the Indonesian government to temporarily agree to the Dutch demands. According to Yogyakarta, the Indonesian capital is mobilizing in case of emergency.

[Another dispatch] A United Nations Secretariat official, Mr. Nolan Han, has arrived in Batavia from Yogyakarta on a US Navy aircraft, reportedly telling Dutch authorities that the Republic's response may not be submitted before the 15th.

### Preventing Western European Economic Suffocation - Urge Speedy Approval of Aid to Europe Plan - Secretary Marshall Asks Congress to Make a Historic Decision

[Reuters, Washington, December 12] Secretary of State Marshall, on December 12, presented his views on the European aid plan to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly stating that the plan is to cope with a major crisis, and posed the following question to Congress: "Will we take action to deal with this situation? Or will we stand by and allow other forces to determine the future destiny of European civilization?"

Secretary Marshall also pointed out that the actions taken by Congress on the European aid plan must have the following conditions: 1. Speed; 2. Appropriate amount; 3. Effective and flexible execution; 4. Cooperation must be maintained with other participating countries. Marshall also emphasized the importance of the plan to the United States. He said, "If we do not take action to deal with this problem today, it will still occur in the future under conditions more unfavorable to us. The situation in Europe has not yet reached the point where economic instability is progressing towards tyrannical regimes, but if the United States does not support Europe's self-help efforts, then that progress will be inevitable. The United States today faces a historic decision, a challenge to our mission that is extremely serious. The purpose of the aid is to prevent the economic suffocation that is currently threatening Western Europe, without harming its national integrity. Although the aid plan will burden the American people, the amount exported under the plan is still lower than in the past fifteen months. When making the decision, it should be based on our most carefully considered interests, the most important of which is the maintenance of lasting peace and individual freedom in Europe."

Deep Appreciation for Western European Cooperation

Secretary Marshall then expressed his appreciation for the promise of the sixteen European countries to implement a cooperative system, and pointed out that the amount of aid that the United States proposed to provide in the initial fifteen months of European aid, 6.8 billion yuan, is 20% less than the estimate of the Paris Conference. Regarding the plan to manage the program, Marshall expressed his willingness to agree to a compromise plan, stating that he has no prejudice in this regard, but he believes that the power of management should be exercised by one person rather than a committee, and that matters related to foreign policy should be controlled and directed by the Secretary of State. Marshall finally reiterated: European economic recovery is necessary to maintain basic freedom in the world's most critical region, and it is also indispensable for the restoration of normal global trade. The world now has only the United States with the ability to support this movement. He also exclaimed, "We need peace, security, and the rapid restoration of the world to normalcy. We are driven by circumstances to take a leading position. Major crises must be overcome, and we must overcome them." Republican Senator Smith asked if this plan would lead to war. Marshall said that the plan would not lead to war and could avoid war. This matter is like gambling, and there is no guarantee of success, but if we do our best, the hope of success is extremely great. He also warned that if we give up halfway, there will be a great backlash in Europe. If there is no appropriate plan, then money is equal to being wasted, so it is better to have no European aid plan at all.

Plan's Goal: Stabilize Europe

Secretary Marshall was again asked about the chances of Western Europe and the Americas resisting Soviet aggression. He replied: Western Europe, on the whole, is not adequately prepared to engage in such resistance. Most of it depends on whether the people support their government. These developments will force the United States to reconsider its foreign policy, but he is not willing to speculate on this at the moment. Finally, he also stated, "What we propose is neither an aggressive plan nor a defensive plan, but to stabilize Europe. An increase in stability will reduce the chances of aggression."

Vandenberg said that the estimates of the State Department differ greatly from the estimates of the Harriman Committee, which investigated the U.S.'s ability to aid Europe.

On the 9th of this month, the radio station once again criticized the attitude of the U.S. military towards South Korea, saying that the United States has turned Korea into an American colony. The criticism of the subconscious radio station is meaningless. This in turn exposes their own conspiracy. The United States is now working hard to study the issue of withdrawing U.S. troops and will thoroughly give the Korean people freedom. The world sees that the Philippines and India have changed from colonies to free and independent countries, so Korea has no reason to become a colony."

### International Court of Justice Prosecution Provides Japanese Secret Documents

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, December 13] According to the most confidential documents submitted to the court this morning by the Far East International Court of Justice Prosecution, the Japanese Army Ministry had decided that before Japan completed its military conquest of China, Japan would resolutely refuse and exclude the interference of other countries in the Sino-Japanese War. The date on this secret document is October 11, 1937. The document stated, "Before we complete our military operations, the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty or the intervention or arbitration of international organizations will never make China repent." The document continued to state that after the military objectives have been achieved, peaceful arbitration can be accepted. At the same time, Japan should notify Germany and Italy of this decision at an "appropriate time" and request that the two countries support this decision. According to the document, ten days later, on October 21, the three Japanese ministers of the army, navy, and foreign affairs unanimously decided to support the above policy. According to the joint resolution of Army Minister Sugiyama Gen, Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa, and Foreign Minister Hirota Koki, "Before Japan has nearly completed the military action goals in China, we absolutely refuse and exclude the presumptuous intervention or arbitration of third countries."

Only Germany and Italy can be notified at an "appropriate time" so as to induce these two axis countries to "act according to our wishes."

The defendant's objection was raised at the meeting yesterday afternoon, apparently fearing that the plaintiff would present new evidence against the 25 defendants during the rebuttal period. Court President Webb said that in order to seek a fair trial, the plaintiff's rebuttal stage is indispensable, and the court should be subject to the evidence presented by the plaintiff during the defense stage. But Webb also said that whether or not to accept any new evidence depends on its reliability and the circumstances at the time. This move implies that if the defendant's defense counsel objects to any new evidence, the court will give due consideration.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, December 13] Tojo and 24 of Japan's top war criminals jointly presented a silk cloth two meters long and one meter wide to Lt. Col.

### "Shanghai Miss" Arrives in Shanghai, An Embarrassing Scene at the Airport, Rong Meixin Tearfully Approaches, Xie Jiahua Turns Away

The two sides had a big quarrel and fight, almost leading to a murder, resulting in a stalemate. Yesterday, Xie returned to Shanghai.

### Police Department Interrogates Corrupt Brigade Commander, Qi Zaiyu Brought to Court in Shackles, Confronts Wu Baokang and His Wife, Obtained Large Sums of Money While Handling Xu Jizhuang Case

[Our Newspaper's Report] The corruption and bribery case of Qi Zaiyu, the Sixth Inspection Brigade Commander of the Garrison Headquarters, was heard in court at the headquarters yesterday. The presiding judge was Deputy Commander Yang Bufei, Chief of Military Law Division Zeng Zhaoyi, Section Chief Zhu Cheng, and Secretary Li Jie.

When Qi Zaiyu was escorted to court, he was wearing short clothes, with iron shackles on his feet, looking very dejected.

The extortion of over 400 million yuan in legal tender from Wu Baokang among Qi's various cases was roughly interrogated yesterday, and the facts of the case have been clarified. Although Qi himself still argued and denied it, it is reported that because the evidence is conclusive, he may be unable to escape the law.

Qi's capable assistant, Xin Runsheng, alias Jin Tuozi, is a somewhat famous "gangster" in the city. Qi used Jin as a "bridge" to extort money from people, with Jin coming forward to handle the matter. This person also had a bad [Blank] during the enemy puppet period, and the charges against him this time are also likely to be serious.

The Garrison Headquarters will continue to interrogate this case today and will summon Japanese national Kenji Iwai to court, because another of Qi's crimes was using Iwai to extort money from Japanese residents. [Blank] was not available, and the interrogation was not completed.

### Yu Bin Talks About American Aid to China, Reports at a Welcome Meeting in the City

[Central News Agency] Yu Bin, the Archbishop of the Nanjing Diocese of the Catholic Church, attended a welcome tea party held by various circles in the city at the Lake Society at 3:00 PM on the 11th after returning to China from his research in the United States at the end of last month. The welcome meeting was presided over by Speaker Pan, and more than 300 people attended, including Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Committee and representatives of various groups. Speaker Pan first delivered a welcome speech, stating: "Archbishop Yu has shouldered the important task of national diplomacy on this trip abroad. In the United States for two months, he had contact with various parties from friendly countries, dispelled many misunderstandings, and will undoubtedly make a great contribution to promoting the sincere cooperation between China and the United States. Archbishop Yu promoted national policies during the War of Resistance, and his achievements are very great. After the victory, due to the Communist disturbances and the people's livelihood, we need more people with international prestige to explain to friends the internal chaos of the Chinese Communists, which is not only a Chinese problem, but also a major disaster for world peace. Archbishop Yu has just returned to China from the United States a few days ago, and his overseas impressions will surely strengthen our understanding of the international community and our understanding of friendly countries."

### General Views Gradually Changed

Archbishop Yu then stood up amidst warm applause to deliver a speech. In addition to expressing his gratitude for the welcome and sentiments of all circles, he detailed his impressions of his trip to the United States and the evolution of the understanding of China by various parties in the United States. He said: "I arrived in San Francisco on October 8th last year. After attending the Catholic Conference on the 10th, I went to Boston. In early November, I went to Washington. President Truman convened a special meeting, and members of the Senate and House of Representatives gathered here. I had a great opportunity to exchange views. At the beginning of the meeting, most of the members believed that the target of emergency assistance should be Europe, France, Italy, and Austria, and the Chinese problem was considered secondary. However, since Senator Judd proposed in the House of Representatives that China, France, Italy, and Austria should be jointly included in the target of emergency assistance, after careful discussion, the general views gradually changed. Therefore, when the case was voted on, except for two votes, all the others agreed to add China to the target of assistance. However, when it was transferred to the Senate for approval and submitted to the appropriations committees of the two houses with the approval of the president, the case was re-complicated. The general committee members still believed that the emergency assistance of 60 million U.S. dollars to China that had been passed was not a large amount, but it would not hurt to pay it after the New Year.

### China Policy Suddenly Became Clear

At this time, gentlemen who actively supported the aid-to-China proposition made impassioned statements to the Senate Appropriations Committee, explaining the seriousness and urgency of the China issue, and it was approved to first [Blank] 20 million U.S. dollars, while the House Appropriations Committee did not fully express its agreement. Therefore, some people advocated [Blank] to give up celebrating Christmas, extend the session, and continue the discussion. The debate was very intense on the [Blank], and some people advocated that aid to China must be combined with economic and military affairs. On the 18th, it was decided to adopt a compromise plan and allocate 18 million U.S. dollars first for emergency loans to China. President Truman's long-term aid to China plan, which was submitted after the resumption of Congress on July 7th, can also be regarded as based on the decision of public opinion on December 18th last year. What needs to be discussed in the future is only various technical issues belonging to the detailed rules. The Central Committee has now assigned responsible technical personnel to go to the United States, and it is believed that the long-term aid to China plan is expected to be formally submitted within one or two weeks. We must pay attention to the fact that in the past month, the United States has had three clear changes in its China policy.

### Marshall Supports Loans to China

Since the start of World War II, the U.S. government has been implementing its policies based on the "Europe First, Asia Second" principle. This concept has caused many adverse effects. However, with the advocacy of visionary politicians, the general American public has a further understanding of the world situation, and the long-standing concept of "Europe First, Asia Second" has gradually changed to the concept of "Europe and Asia equally important". The emergency aid of 18 million U.S. dollars to China was finally approved in a tense meeting. It can be said that this is the first concrete manifestation of the change in the American "world view". The passage of this case has broken years of principles and history has entered a new stage. (2) General Marshall made the highest contributions in World War II, and most Americans have strong faith in him. After his failure to mediate the Chinese issue and return to China last year, he strengthened the American isolationist "hands-off" proposition. Their common misconception is that the Chinese Communists are not unreasonable, but the Kuomintang is also quite stubborn. However, judging from General Marshall's active support for the US loan to China this time, it can be seen that he not only does not misunderstand China, but also does not want to "stand idly by". The allocation of 18 million U.S. dollars is the beginning of active aid to China; it is not only economic aid, but also military aid.

### The US Has Recognized That the Traitor Bandits Are Causing Trouble

In the past, many American general discussions believed that the Chinese civil strife was only a matter for China itself, and that the Communist bandits were just peasants demanding land reform, had nothing to do with the international communist camp, and believed that even if officials were corrupt and the government was incompetent, it would be difficult to achieve success with aid. At that time, those who held this view have now completely changed. The American people have generally recognized that the treacherous bandits in China are actually a part of the international communist camp, and the internal chaos in China is not only a matter for China, but is very likely to be the cause of World War III. After General Marshall's last efforts at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference last winter failed, he also clearly stated, "All the doors of hope have been completely closed, and we must start practical work from now on," and the long-term aid to Europe and China plan is the beginning of this "practical work."

### The Walls of the Two Major Camps Are Becoming More Obvious

At present, the walls of the world's two major camps have become more and more distinct, and the United States' attitude towards the world has become more clear and active. However, it must be known that the active work we will carry out together is not the beginning of war, but the vanguard of peace. We hope that China and the United States will look at each other with a global perspective, and at the same time carry out "re-recognition" and never disrupt the overall plan due to small intolerances. Only with close cooperation between China and the United States and democratic countries can we promote world peace and human happiness." After Mr. Yu's speech, Chairman Fang of [Blank] delivered a reply, believing that Mr. Yu's statement was equivalent to "taking a lesson" on Sino-US mutual understanding, which is worthy of our deep reflection and vigorous review. He also said: "Looking at it from a global perspective, we must seek peace for mankind no matter what. The Communist civil strife is not only a disaster for China, but also a disaster for the human race in the world. Therefore, the government's suppression of bandits and wars is also the most active work for world peace. U.S. aid to China is, of course, appreciated, but people must help themselves first. Our country's war and nation-building must still start with our own efforts." The tea party ended in a warm atmosphere at about 5:00 PM.

### Jianghai Customs Uncovers Two Smuggling Cases by Sea and Air; Western Medicine, Saccharin, and Gold Worth 500 Million

The No. 6 tugboat "Hai Huan" of the General Maritime Transport Brigade arrived in Shanghai last week, towed by the barge "Yanghai Maru" from Hong Kong, and docked at Wharf No. 4 of the China Merchants Bureau. The Customs Anti-Smuggling Division and the Search Team immediately sent personnel to board the vessel. After two days and nights of meticulous inspection, a large quantity of smuggled goods was seized, including Western medicine, saccharin, and playing cards, with a value of approximately 1 billion yuan. In order to thoroughly investigate the location of the smuggled goods, the investigating officers continued to stay on the ship for search. Finally, late at night on the 9th, a suspicious clue was discovered in the first water tank on the starboard side of the ship. After obtaining the consent of the ship's captain, the stored drinking water was drained, and personnel were sent inside for inspection. As a result, a specially made mechanism was discovered inside the water tank. It is reported that the smuggled goods were privately brought in by a certain crew member who is now at large. In addition to confiscating all the smuggled goods, the Customs intends to impose a heavy fine on the shipowner. Furthermore, Customs personnel stationed at the airport, at 2:30 PM on the 11th of this month, inspected China National Aviation Corporation Flight No. T-39, arriving at Longhua Airport from Guangzhou and Hong Kong. They found forty gold bars on the body of a certain Zheng, a radio operator on the plane, tied to his waist with a specially made cloth belt, and obtained a letter proving that the gold bars were entrusted by a friend in Hong Kong to be smuggled in for profit. It is reported that the total value of the smuggled goods in the above two cases is 5 billion yuan.

### Needy Students Hope for Relief

Our newspaper has already started the "Reader Scholarship" fundraising campaign for the spring semester of the 37th year. On that day, we received multiple phone calls and more than a dozen requests from needy students. Apart from two inquiries about donations, most were about the application date and procedures. We have answered all of these inquiries one by one. At the same time, these facts also tell us that countless needy students are anxiously hoping for relief for their educational problems.

The "Reader Scholarship" is now starting to solicit donations. We dare not harbor excessive hopes, because whether its outcome is satisfactory depends entirely on whether readers can give us the greatest assistance.

This year's fundraising for the "Reader Scholarship" will not use the "Goods Fundraising Team." This is in order to promote this movement more broadly and deeply, so that every enthusiastic reader can do their best to donate, the more the better, and even a small amount is acceptable. As the saying goes, "Many a little makes a mickle," and a small number can add up to a large sum. The Lunar New Year is coming soon, dear readers! Save a little more extravagance to help the young people who are waiting for help.

### Communist Bandit Organizations Continue to Be Broken Up in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Fengxian; 17 Criminals Arrested, Many with Status

The Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Command recently assisted a certain organization in the city in breaking up a Communist bandit materials supply association, arresting as many as seventeen criminals. This case is related to the previous case of Ding Xisan's defection and rebellion to the Communist bandits. The investigation is recorded as follows: A certain organization in the city received a secret report last month, knowing that important Communist bandit members had been sent to Shanghai to plan the transportation of materials, and had opened more than a dozen company names in the city as cover. After requesting assistance from the Garrison Command, Commander Xuan immediately issued an order to the Inspection Department, ordering the Waterborne Brigade to assist in handling the matter. The brigade commander, Feng Zhongda, immediately dispatched his subordinates to conduct a secret investigation. On the afternoon of the 23rd of last month, it was discovered that the main criminal in the case, Yu Chengxin, was hiding in Room 233, Zhongzhou Hotel, No. 117, Lane Jia, Shandong Middle Road. Personnel were immediately dispatched to arrest Yu Chengxin, the political commissar of the Communist bandit Maritime Work Committee, Sun Jiao, the deputy commander of the Communist bandit Jiangnan People's Self-Defense Army, and Xiang Junhua, the general person in charge of the Communist bandits (it was found that Xiang was the general manager of a large entertainment establishment in the city), and others, totaling four people. After questioning the team, the team continued to arrest Zhang Heqing, the battalion commander of the Communist bandit Jiangnan People's Self-Defense Army, in Room 140, Jiangsu Hotel, Fuzhou Road, and Shi Liangyuan, a Communist bandit liaison worker in Shanghai, at the funeral home in Nanshi (it was found that Shi was a famous doctor in the city), and Zhang Zongqi and Zhang Zhiliang, personnel in charge of Communist bandit material transportation, at No. 361, Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen. According to the confession, Pei Shaoqing was arrested at No. 6, Baoyuan Street, Yang'an Lane, outside Panmen, Suzhou. It was also discovered that the Communist bandits had a secret radio station in Fengxian for Shanghai-based personnel to use for communication. Personnel were dispatched overnight and broke up the Communist bandit radio station organization at Ruan's Residence, Sanguantang, Fengxian, confiscating a large number of transmitting and receiving machines and other items. Ruan Li, the radio operator in charge of the radio station, was arrested and brought to Shanghai for questioning. Subsequently, Pan Yi, Zhou Anjun, Deng Changyi, Zhou Changqi, Jin Boyi, Jiang Zhuzuoxian, (the head of Wangjiaqiao Township, Fengxian), Tang Boquan (the captain of the Fengxian Self-Defense Team), and others, totaling seventeen people, were arrested in connection with Huacao. After interrogation, all the criminals were transferred to the Nanjing Ministry of National Defense by express train at 9:00 PM on the previous day (12th) for questioning.

### Five Criminals in the Case of Smuggling Pigments to the Bandit Area Transferred to the District Procuratorate

[Our Report] The First Naval Base Command yesterday transferred five criminals, Wang Ruiqi, Xi Cailang, An Atong, Gong Yuelang, and Zhang Genfa, in the case of smuggling pigments to supply the bandit area, and requested the District Procuratorate to investigate. After a brief interrogation by the prosecutor, they were ordered to be temporarily detained. In October of last year, the First Naval Base Command received a secret report from a person named Zhu Hongliang, stating that a merchant named Wang Ruiqi and others were using a sailboat to smuggle a large quantity of pigments from Shanghai through Chongming into the bandit area for supply. The First Base Command immediately ordered the No. 108 boat of the 7th Gunboat Squadron to wait at Qiyao Port in Chongming. The sailboat arrived as scheduled and was intercepted. There were ninety large and small pieces of pigments. After being confiscated by the First Base Command, the sailboat was handed over to the Jianghai Customs for handling. The five criminals were all ordinary citizens and were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation.

### Zhang Lu, the Wei Captain of Zhou Fohai's Guards, Indicted

[Our Report] Zhang Lu's case on suspicion of being a traitor was indicted by the High Procuratorate yesterday. Zhang was accused of serving as the secretary of the late puppet secret agent tycoon Li Shiqun. After being reported by the Garrison Commander, the High Procuratorate investigated and believed that Zhang did commit many evils during the occupation period, which was well known to people in western Shanghai. After investigation and verification by the Garrison Commander and the Changning Road Police Sub-bureau, the prosecution was initiated in accordance with Article 3 and Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors.

### The Hong Zhenliang Brothers Were Accused of Failing to Deliver the Person Reporting Them

Hong Zhenliang and Hong Pinliang were accused of being involved in affiliation with the enemy, as reported in previous newspapers. According to inquiries, when the High Procuratorate investigated this case, the complainant Jiang Xintian was asked to go to the address to be summoned, but no such person was found. The High Procuratorate sent letters based on the allegations to the Shanghai and Wuxian Goods Tax Bureaus of the Ministry of Finance, and the Wuxian County Government and other agencies, asking if they had ever held puppet positions or other affiliations with the enemy. They have successively replied that there was no such thing. It is reported that Hong Zhenliang served the Party and the country from the 17th year until the 23rd year, when he served as the section chief of the Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance. During the War of Resistance against Japan, after the tax office was moved, although he worked at the Siming Bank, he still served secretly in Shanghai to contact the rear according to the order of the office. In January of the 30th year, he was detected by the enemy puppet 76th Division and arrested at the same time as He and others, tax officials left in Shanghai. After being subjected to torture, he was bailed out by Yu Qiaqing. Fellow villagers from Ningbo in Shanghai, the tobacco factory, tobacco industry, and tobacco exchange industries initiated the organization of the China Tobacco Industry Bank and hired Hong as the general manager of the legal department. According to the tobacco industry, the bank had no shares of the traitor Shao Shijun at the time, nor did it collect puppet taxes. It seems to be a malicious accusation. Hong has now filed a defense, and the truth will soon come out.

### Zhou Qi, a Puppet China Film Actor, Denies Advocating for the Enemy and Puppet Regime

[Our Report] Zhou Qi, a puppet China Film actor, was accused of being a traitor and was tried for the first time in the High Court yesterday. Zhou was accused of acting in two films, "Jiang Zhou Weeping Blood Record," which he presided over, and "Turning Back is the Shore," which was presided over by the Prevention Section of the Judicial Department of the puppet police bureau. He also formed the Heping Opera Troupe and performed dramas in Chongming and Nantong, advocating for the enemy and puppet regime. He was previously reported and the High Procuratorate filed a prosecution. At 9:30 yesterday morning, Zhou, wearing a dark blue melton overcoat, was interrogated by Presiding Judge Xiao Xiefen. He argued that he served as an actor in the puppet China Film because he was forced to make a living. The dramas performed in Nantong and Chongming were all rich in national consciousness and did not advocate for the enemy and puppet regime. He requested the court to investigate, and the court ordered a postponement for further questioning. Zhou remained on his original bail.

### Groundbreaking Ceremony Held for Dredging Rivers in Pudong

[Our Report] The dredging of the shallow Doutaipu and Majiabang rivers started on the 11th of this month.

They returned to the urban area at 4:00 PM in the afternoon.

### The Deadline for the Dance Ban Approaches; Dancers Are Marrying One After Another; General Meeting Held This Morning to Discuss Re-employment and Making a Living

[Our Report] The city's dance industry, which has been silent for a long time, is attempting to make a final struggle as the deadline for the dance ban is fast approaching. Thousands of dancers from all over the city will gather at the Vienna Ballroom at 9:00 this morning to hold a general meeting. In addition to responding to the women's community's campaign to donate winter clothing, the main focus of discussion is how they will transition to other careers in the future. Representatives from military, police, party, government agencies, and women's associations will attend to assist them in making concrete decisions. There are approximately 3,000 dancers in the city. In recent months, due to the surging wave of the dance ban, there have been few new entrants to the industry, and there are many who are tired of the entertainment industry and are seeking someone to marry. Even in the association formed by the dancers themselves to solve the problem of their future, in addition to the general manager Jin Meihong, many of the executives have also married one after another, so the actual number of dancers has been sharply reduced compared to before. It is generally expected that once the trend of dancers marrying has started, the direction of dancers' re-employment in the future will likely still be mostly marrying.

### Robbery Case on Fangbang West Road Solved

### The City of Zhenjiang Laments the Dying Year Amidst Economic Decline

[Report from Zhenjiang, 11th] The disaster-ridden 36th year has quietly passed, and most people who are mindful of danger in times of peace still recall the hardships they have suffered in the past year with a heavy heart. The most unforgettable thing is nothing more than prices. People seem to have a dim view of the major policies of the country, which can be glimpsed from the mouths of some public school staff and small citizens who read the wall newspaper every day, especially in anemic Zhenjiang, where this phenomenon is very common amidst the urgent year-end season and the frequent urging of the lunar calendar.

The Mountains Are Exhausted, But the Water Is Not Bad; The Blood Is Poor, But the Heart Is Not Broken

After the Opium War, Zhenjiang was opened as a commercial port and flourished for a period of time, but this golden age quickly passed after the Tianjin-Pukou, Shanghai-Nanjing through military joint transport, and Jiangshu waterway traffic to Nantong and Taixing in northern Jiangsu. Although its commercial conditions can still maintain the advantage of convenient transportation in terms of imports and exports, the transshipment business it receives has weakened in importance in both space and time. Zhenjiang, as an important transportation hub between the north and south of the Yangtze River and the capital of Jiangsu Province, has a population of up to 210,000 in the urban area, but the consumers are mostly poor public school staff and some thrifty locals, not a commercial area. There is only one flour factory and one match factory locally, nor is it an industrial area. When civil servants cry that their monthly salary is not enough, merchants naturally cry that it cannot be done. Thus, Zhenjiang has formed an anemic city, constantly complaining about poverty all year round. In the few days before the Gregorian New Year, a department store equivalent to Zhenjiang Yong'an Company held a winter sale, but it was difficult to spend 50 million yuan a day. The Five Oceans Department Store is the most popular place here, but that's all there is to the excitement. No wonder the locals humbly say: "Our Zhenjiang only has poor mountains and bad waters." In fact, although the mountains of Zhenjiang are becoming barren day by day, the rolling Yangtze River and the clear springs of Zhenjiang are clear, heavy, and have not been seen to be bad. Although Zhenjiang is now anemic, from the existing social customs, political atmosphere, educational status, and commercial habits, in many ways, people's hearts cannot be considered broken, and the future is still quite bright. It is hoped that it can be entrusted to the finalization of northern Jiangsu, peace with everyone, and the reconstruction of an industrial area where there are many producers and few consumers.

Prices Are Rising Daily; The Year-End Is Viewed More Lightly

From the end of the 36th year to today, Zhenjiang's prices have closely followed Shanghai and risen daily. Under the upward wind of such rapidly rising money, merchants still say they are not making money. The reason is that although more and more money is needed, there are fewer and fewer goods. Selling short and then replenishing inevitably reduces inventory. In this day and age, merchants estimate their respective wealth by only counting goods and not counting money. Now that the dangerous year-end is approaching, the heart of price increases is even stronger, so no matter how tight your monetary policy is, prices are still rising daily, only suffering the people who are still so poor that they have not forgotten the lunar New Year. They have to inquire about business conditions all day long. According to Zhenjiang's current price estimates, a middle-class family spends 3-4 million yuan just to buy some rice noodles, salted goods, sugar, oil, incense, candles, and paper horses for the New Year, while those who are more frugal, such as coolies and rickshaw pullers, also have to spend 1-2 million. If there is no source for this money, then everyone can only view this helpless year more lightly. Thus, the 23 pig shops that have already closed here rarely think about opening before the lunar New Year. Sugar and food shops have only bought half the amount of raw materials used last year for the New Year. The largest shoe store only hopes to sell 50 pairs of shoes a day. The candles in incense shops are becoming thinner and thinner, and the firecrackers in firecracker shops are even smaller. Small items, such as children's toys, are also scattered like distant stars on the stalls. Compared with last year, this year feels dim, which is expected to be dim according to regulations, and feels a little miserable according to custom. However, for the sake of frugality, suppressing rebellion, and building the country, people still better view this old year-end more lightly, why suffer!

2,900 Shops; The Back Walls Are All Desolate

Speaking of the year-end and thinking of last year, according to the reporter's investigation: among the more than 2,960 shops belonging to the 66 trade associations in Zhenjiang, the most profitable in the year 36 were the Five Oceans and department stores, followed by the silver and money industry, "China" and "Transportation" among the national banks, "Shanghai Bank" among the commercial banks, "Provincial Bank" and "Su Agricultural" among the local banks, and "Jin Yuan" among the money industry. The oil and tung industry went through the year plainly. The timber industry was not bad in the first half of the year, but it was pulled to a draw in the second half of the year because of the police along the river and obstructed transportation. The grain industry mostly had a surplus, and the silk and cloth industry barely managed to cover expenses. The western industry saw both prosperity and decline. Cotton yarn was limited in appetite and had no great profits, but a few speculators made very good profits. Among those who lost the most money last year, the first was the wheel industry, which was constantly plagued by coal shortages. Almost every company said it was losing money. In addition, restaurants, dim sum shops, and bathhouses also had no profits to gain. According to general merchants, there are two reasons for the sluggishness of Zhenjiang's commerce: one is small capital, two are few sources of wealth, and three are few loans. Now that industrial and commercial loans have stopped, and bills of exchange cannot be done, and in-kind mortgages are only urged to be redeemed and not accepted, the crisis for merchants with insufficient capital will be even greater if they beg for usurious loans. At present, the result of tightening the money supply can only achieve mutual benefits and disadvantages, and it is difficult to hope for absolutely helping to suppress prices, because there are very few hoarders in Zhenjiang, so the shops in Zhenjiang, except for a few grain shops, nine out of ten have no warehouses, and nine out of ten have three walls not empty, and one wall is desolate. This one wall is the back wall that was full of inventory in the past. Desolate back walls are a common phenomenon in Zhenjiang's commercial market. Therefore, last year, the direct tax that Zhenjiang merchants could barely contribute to the country was only 1.3 billion yuan for the whole year, and they still felt strained by that amount.

Poor Fried Dough Sticks; Skinny and Too Weak to Endure the Wind

Although the merchants' saying has its reasonable grounds, according to the view of the general consuming public, it is felt that today, when the government is tightening the money supply and tightening the monetary policy, if it can implement universal rationing of food and daily necessities, and then add a reasonable and sympathetic approach to stabilize prices, the economic situation should be improved. However, if the flat-price policy in various places can only be applied to fried dough sticks and boiled water, and they are not allowed to increase prices, one eye is opened and one eye is closed, allowing them to become smaller and thinner every day, and less and less every day, that approach is not enough to be a model. Now, the 1,000 yuan fried dough stick in Zhenjiang has had a miracle. That three-inch long, six-fen wide, poor fried dough stick is so skinny that it cannot withstand a gust of wind, and it may be blown to the ground. (Our Special Correspondent Fang Canglang)

### Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau Plans to Green Jiangnan Highways

[Our Newspaper Wujin, 12th] The Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau, in view of the successive repairs of the highways in Jiangnan and their subsequent opening to military traffic, but with the trees on both sides mostly destroyed, plans to plant trees extensively along each highway before spring arrives to green the long roads. Changzhou plans to plant trees this spring on a total highway length of 961 kilometers, planting 200 trees per kilometer. The Highway Bureau will subsidize 900 yuan for each sapling, totaling over 19 million yuan. Recently, the Wugong Works Section of the bureau sent a letter to the county government, urging it to quickly determine the purchase of saplings and to report the types and quantities of saplings for verification and issuance. This county will extensively plant saplings in the spring.

### Friends of Farmers in Changzhou

[Our Newspaper Wujin, 10th] In the heart of the Jiangnan Plain, tens of thousands of shi of golden grain are appearing on the stage under the faint autumn sun. The farmers who have worked hard for three springs and one summer cannot help but think of these two friends of farmers at the time of autumn harvest and winter storage: Qi Electric Power Plant and the Farmers Bank of China.

Outline of the Power Plant

Qi Electric Power Plant is located between Dingyan and Qi townships, about 15 kilometers outside the east gate of Wujin. The plant site covers a large area. To the east, it is connected to the machinery factory, with chimneys towering high and workshops lined up. As passengers pass by on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, it resembles a modern industrial zone. The plant was originally built in the 11th year of the Republic of China [i.e., 1922] as the Zhenhua Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant, a joint venture between Chinese and German businessmen, originally planned to manufacture generators. The power plant was completed in the 12th year [i.e., 1923] and began generating electricity for civilian use in Changzhou and Wuxi counties. In the 17th year [i.e., 1928], due to poor business and frequent disputes, the government, at the request of local public organizations, took it over and nationalized it, placing it under the Construction Committee. In the 26th year [i.e., 1937], the central government decided to transfer the plant to Yangzi Electric Company for private operation. During the occupation period, it was occupied by the enemy for eight years and suffered severe damage. After the victory, it was initially taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and soon operated by the Tenth Company, nominally a joint venture between government and business.

Glimpse of Equipment

There are currently six tin furnaces. Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 were produced by German Babcock & Wilcox and were originally installed by Zhenhua. Each has an evaporation capacity of 10 tons per hour. Number 5 is also a product of the same factory, with an evaporation capacity of 30 tons. Number 6 furnace is a Riley product with an evaporation capacity of 50 tons. The generators have four steam turbine types. Numbers 1 and 2 have a capacity of 3,200 kilowatts each and are products of Siemens, but they are old and are now used as backup machines. Numbers 3 and 4 are products of AEG. Number 3 has a capacity of 3,200 kilowatts, and Number 4 has a capacity of 7,500 kilowatts. There is also a newly installed mobile generator, a Mitsubishi product, with a capacity of 2,500 kilowatts. This machine is entirely mounted on a train-style frame. The style is novel and was originally a wartime product, easy to move during emergencies. The factory is building a new house to accommodate it. Other facilities such as coal transportation and water supply are complete.

Electric Irrigation

The total daily power generation is approximately 210,000 kilowatt-hours or more. In addition to illuminating the people of Changzhou, Wuxi, and Danyang with "brightness" and turning the wheels of various industries with power, what is most commendable is the promotion of electrified irrigation, which directly benefits farmers. If there is a TVA movement in China, the Qi factory is undoubtedly the originator. Trial implementation began in the 13th year of the Republic of China [i.e., 1924]. The irrigation area was initially limited to Changzhou and Wuxi counties. In the 19th year [i.e., 1930], the Construction Committee believed that this matter was of great importance and established a special agency to manage it, and the scope was expanded daily. In the 27th year [i.e., 1938], electricity was extended to Danyang, and part of the farmland in that county also became electrified. This work was quite difficult and was not interrupted even during the occupation period. The scale has now taken shape, and farmers find it convenient and the effect is remarkable. There are a total of 128 electric pumping stations in Changzhou, Wuxi, and Danyang counties. The benefited farmland in the three counties totals approximately 143,000 mu. Changzhou, being located near the water, has as many as 92 stations, benefiting more than 70,000 mu of farmland. Mr. Zhao Guangyu of the factory, who is in charge of this matter, has contributed a great deal and is particularly commendable. However, the supply and demand are still far apart, and it is hoped that the factory will make more efforts.

Activities of the Farmers Bank of China

The Changzhou branch of the Farmers Bank of China has been very active in promoting rural welfare and supporting production this year. It has spared no effort in handling fertilizer loans, water conservancy loans, and silkworm and cotton cloth loans. Mr. Chen Mo, the director of the agricultural loan department of the bank, under the leadership of the person in charge, Mr. Wu Guangmo, travels day and night between the city and the countryside, carefully plans and organizes meticulously, and has won the exceptional goodwill of the farmers, who call him a messenger of good news, which is particularly commendable. The cotton cloth production and sales cooperation he has organized, lending to farmers to purchase looms and cotton yarn for weaving, means that in the villages around Hutangqiao outside the south gate, almost every household has a loom and every household is weaving. As a result, the daily output of Changzhou cotton cloth is more than 30,000 pieces, with more than 20,000 looms, requiring more than 300 bales of yarn per day. This rural weaving actually accounts for a crucial part of the military needs. The transfusion work of rural weaving is thoughtful and flexible, and the Farmers Bank of China has made the greatest possible friendship.

Water Conservancy Assistance

Changzhou's irrigation industry was quite developed in the past, but it suffered severe destruction during the Anti-Japanese War. The Bank is carrying out planned restoration of the original equipment first, and then gradually promoting and expanding it. In terms of manpower, it is cooperating with agricultural associations, cooperatives, and water conservancy associations in various townships to organize institutions dedicated to this task. This year, 30 electric power stations have been restored, and the required equipment includes square sheds, boat-style brick houses, motors, belts, water pumps, water pipes, transformers, and electric meters. The power stations rely on the Qi factory for electricity supply. If electricity cannot be delivered everywhere, mechanical pumping is used instead. With the assistance of the Farmers Bank of China, 33 machine stations have been restored this year. The important equipment includes machine boats or brick houses, diesel power machines, pump belts, and water ditches. The maximum horsepower is 30 horsepower, and the minimum is 18 horsepower. The bank's loans are specifically used for purchasing or repairing motors, square sheds, poles and wires, lead-in wires, water pumps, and electric meters. The total price of the above two types of equipment at that time was 190,000 yuan. The bank grants loans at 60%, totaling more than 116 million yuan, and the rest is raised by the farmers themselves. Beforehand, personnel are sent to Shanghai together with representatives of farmers' organizations to order goods, and the bank's internal organs pay according to the order form to prevent malpractice. For self-raised electric pumping, each mu of land is paid 50 jin of grain in advance, and for machines, each mu is charged 10,000 yuan. The self-raised funds, together with the loans, are mostly used to purchase equipment, and the rest is used for fuel and miscellaneous expenses. The economy is quite clear and open.

Farmers Benefit

Using machine power to pump water eliminates hard labor, which is extremely convenient for farmers. At the same time, under the implementation this year, a total of 43,127 mu of irrigated land has benefited more than 6,270 farmers. From an economic point of view, if manual pumping is used, with each frame managed by four people and irrigated four times per season, the wages for 43,000 mu of land would be at least 3.5 billion yuan or more per season, while the cost of using electricity and machinery is only 200 million yuan, saving more than 3.3 billion yuan. At the same time, with proper and timely irrigation, the rice seedlings grow well. According to experts, the minimum increase in yield per mu is half a dan, which means an increase of more than 21,500 dan for more than 43,000 mu. At the current price of 350,000 yuan per dan, this would mean an increase of more than 7.5 billion yuan. No wonder farmers in general are extremely grateful for the assistance of the Farmers Bank of China. The bank is planning to expand its business in the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948]. It is hoped that the government will strongly support this practical work related to national economy and people's livelihood so that it can develop to a high degree, and then rural construction and national construction will no longer fail.

[Our Newspaper Wujin, 12th] At more than one o'clock in the early morning of the 11th, the Shanghai-Zhenjiang section train No. 5 or 6, when arriving at Changzhou Station from Qixiayan, should have stopped as usual. Unexpectedly, there was a power outage at the time, and the entire station was pitch black. Although the stationmaster on duty used a red light to indicate the stop, the train drove straight through, ignoring the signal. Then, the train immediately used danger signals and blew the whistle frantically, but all were ineffective, and the train drove past. It was only after crossing the Xiyang flag for two kilometers that the train was retracted back to the station. This fact was extremely dangerous.

### Li Shuhua Returns to China to Talk About Post-War Japanese Science

[Shenzhou News Agency Dispatch] Dr. Li Shuhua, Vice President of the Beiping Research Institute and representative of China attending the UN Education Conference, flew to Shanghai from Tokyo the night before last and reported to the Central Government in Nanjing last night. Yesterday, Dr. Li met with reporters and spoke freely about the discussions on scientific matters at the UN Education Conference and his observations on the work of scientific research in Japan.

UN Conference Emphasizes Scientific Cooperation

It is said that the UN Education Conference attaches great importance to scientific research and decided to continue the plan of the Paris Conference two years ago: To establish scientific cooperation offices in Nanjing, Brazil, and Cairo, Egypt. These offices were officially established last year, and one will be established in India this year. To establish a scientific research institute in Amanson, at the mouth of the Amazon River in Brazil, South America, this year to engage in research on geology, meteorology, animals, etc. To establish nutrition centers in China and India. These centers are linked to world agricultural and food organizations. Others, such as facilitating the travel of scientists, exchanging professors and students, and strengthening the flow of scientific publications, are all discussed and must be implemented by the UN Education Conference. After the conference, in addition to visiting the United States, Mr. Li also stayed in Tokyo for a week on his return trip to observe the work of scientific research in Japan.

Japan Buries Itself in Scientific Research

Dr. Li said: The first impression of Japan is that the bombing during the war was fierce. Tokyo and Yokohama were bombed into ruins, proving that Japan was no longer able to fight. Even if the atomic bomb had not been dropped, they would have had to surrender. He visited the University of Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Imperial University), which is large in scale, with the buildings of the "Physics," "Chemistry," "Engineering," and "Agriculture" colleges concentrated and well-equipped. He visited the Physics Research Institute, which was mostly destroyed by bombing during the war. Atomic physics research is now prohibited, and the original two atomic splitters and another splitter in Osaka have all been thrown into the sea. The current director of the institute, Dr. Hebon Ganh, is a nuclear physicist with a very good reputation. The Aviation Research Institute of Tokyo University has been renamed the Tokyo University Institute of Science and Technology. It is well-equipped and large in scale. In addition to the aviation department, it is still continuing its work and research non-stop. There were originally twenty wind tunnels for aviation, and three smaller ones are still left. In addition, he visited the Kobayashi Physics Research Institute, which is also working on machinery. Dr. Li also said: Japan is quite poor after the war, but in this difficult environment, scientists are still actively engaged in research work, and this hard-working spirit is extremely admirable. Yu Tang, Japanese scientists, university presidents, and Minister of Education Morito, etc., all highly praised the League of Nations cultural and educational organization, and Japan very much hopes to participate. They have collected various materials related to the League of Nations and compiled them into a book. Japanese scientists expressed their hope to cooperate with our country in scientific research. We also agree that this will only be a future problem when the peace treaty is established. Looking back at our country's current equipment, it is severely inadequate. It cannot be compared with the United States and the United Kingdom, and it is not without shame compared to Japan. In the future, we should have a stable and well-equipped scientific research environment, and Chinese scientists who are currently researching abroad will definitely return home as soon as possible, and our scientific research will definitely be more advanced.

### Dispute Over Hanging School Signs Leads to Conflict Between Students of Two Schools in Fujian

At noon, all the students of the Senior Business School went to the Provincial Government to petition, and the Agricultural College also posted slogans along the streets, each seeking to punish the perpetrators.

He plans to return to Shanghai in ten days. Fang Zimao, Minister Zhu's accompanying secretary, met with reporters from this newspaper at the Academia Sinica yesterday and said: This trip is Minister Zhu's first trip to Taiwan in his life. After arriving in Taiwan, he also plans to visit Taichung and Tainan. Education in Taiwan Province has a good foundation due to the long-term rule of the Japanese. National education is widespread, and university facilities are above those of schools in the mainland. After the restoration, coordinating the administrative facilities of the province is also one of the main tasks. After returning from this inspection, Minister Zhu will seek its development in coordination with various aspects. When asked by reporters about the Ministry of Education's work plan for this year and the national education funding issue, Fang replied that after the restoration, the school buildings of various universities would be gradually restored, but the library and instrument equipment still need to be supplemented. In principle, university education will seek qualitative development. As for the development of national education, it is related to the issue of education funding, which is clearly stipulated in the Constitution. Fang emphasized: The Constitution has now begun to be implemented. We believe that the government will increase education funding according to law; otherwise, it would be illegal. As for whether students in provincial and municipal normal schools should be given the same treatment as students in national normal schools, Fang did not give a definite answer. Regarding the private universities' request for financial assistance, he said that the government's current strength is insufficient, and it is feared that it will be difficult to fulfill their wishes. Fang said that the books and instruments for higher education raised by the Ministry of Education in the United States and a part of the science, engineering, and agriculture books and instruments subsidized by the United Nations have recently arrived and will be distributed to various schools by the Ministry, and some of them have already been distributed.

The Ministry of Education is currently drafting it and will announce it after it is approved by the Executive Yuan. This new method stipulates that self-funded students must provide all the foreign exchange at market prices themselves and must have graduated from a domestic university and passed a relevant study abroad examination organized by the Ministry of Education. Fang Zhi also said: In terms of the country's current financial resources, the public-funded study abroad examination will be temporarily suspended this year, but the 100 students who have already been admitted to the wartime translation student study abroad examination are expected to go abroad this autumn.

### Dagong Suffers a Scare: Wins Fiercely Against Qingbai: Stalemate Lasts for Over Twenty Minutes, Resulting in 59 to 33

[Our Newspaper's Report] In last night's basketball league match, the perennial champion Dagong team suffered a scare, almost being embarrassed by Qingbai. The three thousand spectators in the gymnasium were greatly surprised. In the first half, Dagong led by only one point, 20 to 19. In the first five minutes of the second half, the score continued to fluctuate. Qingbai exceeded four times throughout the game, but after each reached 25 points, Dagong finally stood out and soared, resulting in a final score of 59 to 33.

Qingbai Fights Hard

The reasons for last night's situation were: Dagong had just returned from Nanjing, tired from the journey and lacking sufficient practice time. The cold weather and a slight underestimation of the opponent contributed to their initial struggles. Once they fell into a disadvantageous position, they became increasingly frustrated. Qingbai's man-to-man defense and all-out effort were effective, and their taller players provided a significant advantage. In the first half, Qingbai's shooting was unusually smooth. However, after each side reached 25 points in the second half, Qingbai, exhausted from the intense battle, lost momentum. Qingbai's stamina could not keep up. Dagong was confident in their ability and ultimately prevailed.

Only One Point More

Initially, the two sides were locked in a stalemate, with the ball spinning on the rim, frustrating the fans. In five minutes of tense play, the score only changed to 4 to 3, with Dagong leading by one point. Soon after, it became 9 to 3. Qingbai's veterans, Wang Nanzhen and Xu Ting, although having fewer shooting opportunities, made every shot count, gradually creating an even game. When Cai Yanxiong scored, Qingbai took the lead at 12 to 13, surprising Dagong. Trailing by as many as four points at 13 to 17, Tang Shikun fouled out and was replaced by Ju Dayun. In an instant, Dagong tied the score at 17. Dagong managed to take a narrow lead of 20 to 19 by the end of the first half.

Standing Out

Yanxiong's free throw tied the score at 20 at the beginning of the second half, and Shaoqing added another point to give Qingbai the lead again. Dagong's Cai Lianke scored, and soon the score was tied again at 22, 24, and 25, intensifying the battle. Dagong scored two points, and Lianke's free throw made it 28 to 25, after which they sailed smoothly, leading by 14 points at 39 to 25. Qingbai brought in two new players, Wang Junbing and Zhuo Guorong, but their formation was disorganized, and they were at the end of their rope, unable to reverse the situation. The final score was 59 to 33, with Qingbai losing due to lack of stamina.

Other Two Games

The other matches last night: In the second division B group, Jiashen won against Team V with a score of 47 to 34. In the first division group, Shantou easily defeated the U.S. Military Police with a score of 69 to 36. Jiashen's three forwards shot accurately and were physically strong. The first half ended with 24 to 10, and the second half was highly competitive, with Jiashen ultimately winning 47 to 34. Shantou's Chen Qingjiang and He Lide scored the most points with frenzied attacks. The first half ended with 31 to 24. In the second half, Shantou showed no mercy, winning decisively with a score of 69 to 36.

### Measures for Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans: Uniform Handling by Banking and Money Industries: Six Handling Measures to be Drafted by the Banking Association

[Our Newspaper Report] After the Executive Yuan promulgated the Regulations on Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry on December 26 of last year (the full text of which was published on page 2 of this newspaper on December 23 of last year), according to the regulations, settlement should be completed within one month after the promulgation of the regulations. In view of this, the Banking Association of this city, immediately entrusted the Banking Association to actively research after the promulgation of the regulations, and has now drafted six uniform handling measures for clearing pre-war deposits and loans in the banking industry. The Banking, Money, and Trust Associations will jointly announce and start processing these measures within days. The contents of the handling measures are first reported as follows:

Uniform Handling Measures

Article 1: These measures are formulated in accordance with the Regulations on Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry (hereinafter referred to as the Clearing Regulations).

Article 2: Deposits and loans made on or before August 13, 1937, shall be calculated by doubling the amount specified in the attached table of the Clearing Regulations. The total of principal and interest per yuan is 3,405.924 yuan.

Deposits and loans made from August 14, 1937 to December 9, 1941 (including the 9th), shall be calculated according to the amount specified in the attached table of the Clearing Regulations.

The total amount of principal and interest calculated according to the preceding two paragraphs is uniformly referred to as the multiple.

Article 3: The methods for calculating various deposits are stipulated as follows:

1.  Fixed Deposits: The original principal multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date shall be the standard. For those that have been rolled over, regardless of whether the deposit certificate or passbook has been changed, the calculation shall be traced back to the original deposit date. However, this is limited to cases where the branch office or division on the deposit certificate or passbook uses the original account name. The calculation method is as follows:

(A) Interest Rolled Over: If the principal and interest are fully renewed at the time of rollover, the original principal multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date shall be the standard.

(B) Interest Withdrawn and Rolled Over: If part or all of the interest is paid at the time of rollover and then renewed, the original principal multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date shall be used, and then the interest paid each time (including income tax) multiplied by the multiple of the corresponding payment date shall be deducted, and the remaining balance shall be the standard.

(C) Principal Increased and Rolled Over: If, in addition to renewing the principal and interest, additional principal is deposited at the time of rollover, the original principal multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date shall be added to the additional principal multiplied by the multiple of the additional deposit date, and the total amount shall be the standard.

The additional principal mentioned in the preceding paragraph refers to the principal actually added by the depositor, excluding the interest on the original principal.

(D) Principal Reduced and Rolled Over: If, in addition to withdrawing interest, part of the principal is also withdrawn at the time of rollover and then renewed, the remaining principal multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date shall be used, and then the interest paid on the withdrawn principal portion multiplied by the multiple of the interest payment date shall be deducted, and the remaining balance shall be the standard.

2.  Deposits with the nature of Zero Deposit and Lump Sum Payment: Each deposit shall be calculated by multiplying the principal deposited each time by the multiple of the corresponding deposit date.

3.  Deposits with the nature of Lump Sum Deposit and Zero Payment: The calculation shall be made by analogy with the methods in paragraphs (B) and (D) of item 1 of this article. However, for the sake of simplicity, the original principal may be multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date, and then the principal and interest already paid may be deducted, multiplied by the multiple of the corresponding payment date, with the remaining balance as the standard.

4.  Deposits with the nature of Zero Deposit and Zero Payment: The zero deposit portion shall be calculated by analogy with the zero deposit and lump sum payment method. The zero payment portion shall be calculated by analogy with the lump sum deposit and zero payment method.

Article 4: For deposits made before August 13, 1937, in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Clearing Regulations, the interest calculated from the date of deposit to August 13, 1937, when incorporated into the principal, shall no longer be subject to deduction of deposit interest income tax.

Article 5: For interest already paid from August 14, 1937, when deducting from the household in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of these measures, the full amount of the original interest shall be calculated, and the income tax already paid shall no longer be deducted.

2.  If there are additional loans or advances made midway after the loan, and interest is not paid, they shall be calculated separately according to the multiple of the respective loan date or advance date.

### Local Buyers Take the Opportunity to Buy Low, Cotton Yarn Market Rises, 42-Count Fine Yarn Rises Back Over Two Million

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market opened flat, but soon local buyers took the opportunity to buy low, and replica manufacturers also came to purchase, leading to a rise in prices. Towards the end, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose to 63.3 million yuan, an increase of 2.1 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan to 1.2 million yuan.

Cloth Stable

The cotton cloth market showed a promising trend from the beginning yesterday. The Ningbo and Fujian buyers purchased a large amount of Yuan bi ji, and the Hankou buyers also came to purchase, which made the prices more favorable, and the remaining goods were also promising. But after eleven o'clock, the money market suddenly tightened, and Shanxi buyers sold Golden Seal bi ji, and at that time there were few buyers, and because the yarn and flower merchants were subject to a deadline set by the authorities, they had to register tomorrow (the 15th), the industry was generally wait-and-see, and the market atmosphere changed from strong to weak. Towards the end, the price of bi ji rebounded by more than 20,000 yuan due to active trading. Various grades of fine cloth such as 12-pound Dragon Head Wufu also rose from 5,000 to 25,000 yuan. In addition, only bleached cloth and colored cloth, such as shilin cloth and zhen gong, became more popular, and the market atmosphere for other cloths remained soft.

Spot Cotton Active

Yesterday's spot cotton market was firm due to the jump in cotton yarn prices, and yarn mills were eager to purchase, and weaving factories also made offers to purchase, and there were mutual transactions between the industry, and the trading was still busy. The trend was not weak, and 800 bales were traded freely.

[Our Newspaper Report] China Textile Construction Company continued to purchase stored cotton yesterday, totaling 329 iron machine bales (about 450 catties per bale) and 59 wooden machine bales (about 450 catties per bale). The purchase prices were 5.2 million yuan for Qidong fine velvet, 6.5 million yuan for Dezi cotton, 5.1 million yuan for Hankou fine velvet, and 5.08 million yuan for Babao cotton.

Textile Construction Sells Cloth

### Rayon Recovers, Silk Goods See High Prices Near Closing

After continuous declines for several days, the rayon market suddenly recovered yesterday. 120-count Asahi bright yarn opened in the morning shouting a high price of 104 million yuan, but due to the imbalance between supply and demand, it fell back, closing at 2 million yuan. It rebounded in the afternoon, and the afternoon price rose to a selling price of 5 million yuan, and finally to 6 million yuan, while Toyo was 7 million yuan, which means that the average increase compared with the previous day was 8 million yuan.

Factory Silk

Because silk merchants all have allocations, there is no demand, and the market only traded five dan of C-grade silk yesterday, with the price at 105 million yuan, which is the same as the previous day. The asking prices for other grades were similar to the previous day. Dry warp silk has an even narrower path, and there was still no transaction yesterday, and the asking price did not change.

Silk Goods

Yesterday's silk quilt market rose again. The strong goods opened at about 1.8 million yuan, and the next-day delivery had a transaction at 2.1 million yuan. Due to high selling, it fell to about 500,000 yuan in the middle, and then rebounded near the close. As a result, the closing price for spot was 1.8 million yuan, and the next-day delivery was 2.2 million yuan. The off-site transaction in the afternoon was as high as 2.8 million yuan. Dachang plaid cloth was asking for 180,000 yuan in the morning, but it was not traded. Other goods were generally firm.

### Consolidated Bonds Recovered Yesterday, Foreign Stocks Mixed

Yesterday, public bonds recovered because the currency reform was still far away. Unified C opened at 80,000 yuan in the morning, and fell from 84,000 to 69,000 at the close, with a turnover of 4 million, which was 8,000 yuan lower than the previous closing for A, B, and E, and C fell by 12,000 yuan. Unified D fell by 73 yuan. Yesterday, foreign stocks, except for Yeguang and cardboard, which showed a special upward trend, the hot stocks Hong Kong Electric returned to a long of three yuan two and then became weak. Yi Yarn opened in the morning from 650,000 to a high bond step down to 600,000 and then stabilized slightly. The securities dealers were selling and buying, and as a result, compared with the previous closing, British Union fell by half a percent, cardboard rose by one percent, Yeguang rose by half a percent, and the rest were generally weak.

### Chinese Stocks Show Strong Buying Interest, Yong Yarn Creates Another High Price

Chinese stocks were strong in the first half of yesterday and then recovered. The off-site price was always ahead by a lot. The chips were scarce, and once there was news to help the buying, most of the major players in the industry had extravagant hopes, and then ended at a high price.

The opening in the morning was still firm, but the hand-over opening was already peaceful, so both the spot and hand-over of Yong Yarn opened at a price of 765 yuan, selling to a low price of 752 yuan and 755 yuan, turning the sale into a purchase, and the off-site asking price was raised to more than 800 yuan, and rose to 785 yuan and 797 yuan. Because there were many sellers, it fell back to 767 yuan and 775 yuan. The off-site interest rate was opened high to three corners and three corners and a half, and the money market tightened, but the market sentiment was good. The market price was around 770 yuan and 780 yuan, and the tug-of-war state lasted for a long time, and then rose to more than 780 yuan and 790 yuan. Near noon, it had fallen to a low price of 760 yuan and 768 yuan, and the noon closing recovered to 768 yuan and 785 yuan. As a result, the spot-delivered stocks Tongyi and Wuhe rose by half a percent compared with the previous closing, Li An fell by half a percent, and the rise and fall of the remaining stocks were slight. The forward-delivered stocks Xinhe Pingping, Yong Yarn and Qinxing rose slightly, and the rest suffered small setbacks.

In the afternoon, the market opened with the long and short of Hong Kong Electric, and there was a lot of disparity and uncertainty. Yong Yarn initially rose to 788 yuan and 797 yuan, and soon fell back to 770 yuan and 774 yuan. The exchange difference of the National Bank was very large and there was a plate. Later, because of the news that the United States had stopped aiding China, the buyers were unusually intense, and then rose to a high price of 820 yuan and 823 yuan, taking the opportunity to sell high and there was a recovery, but China Silk hung up with a limit up, and the closing price of Yong Yarn was 819 yuan and 821 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning closing, the spot-delivered stocks China Silk rose to the limit, Yonggong, Yong Yarn, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Commerce rose by half a percent, China France and Tongyi rose by one percent, and the rest rose slightly. The forward-delivered stocks Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Jingfu each rose by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly. The off-site unlisted stocks still looked good. The old stocks Dasheng One Factory and Bank of Communications were the most popular, each rising by one percent.

### The Commission Rate for Purchasing Books, Western Medicines, and Other Items Has Not Yet Been Decided

The Review Committee for Handling Uncertified Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Goods Arriving at the Port held its 16th meeting at the China Trust Bureau yesterday (the 13th), and discussed the commission rate for purchasing prices for non-quota goods in Annex 3 (A), such as books, electrical materials, and sanitary equipment. As a result, because there are many types of goods, a decision cannot be made for a while, and it is necessary to wait for a comprehensive plan before continuing to discuss at the regular meeting held this Saturday. Regarding the commission rate for Western medicines, because it is the same in nature as chemical products, it will be proposed for discussion together at the next meeting. As for the application for purchasing paper, wood, and hardware from the original importers, as of the previous month, the committee has issued notification orders with a total value of approximately 300,000 to 400,000 US dollars, and the remaining are in wait-and-see mode. In addition, there are still four types of commission rates that the committee has not proposed for discussion: wool, rubber, automobiles, parts, and pigments.

### Rice Market Conditions Stagnant, Oil Market Fluctuating

Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving at both the northern and southern markets was over 15,100 stones. Rice was supplied for sale as usual, but shop demand was normal, and there were few registered buyers. Market conditions were stagnant. Early Bo rice uniformly fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, while medium and lower grades fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. White japonica rice also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and indica rice fell back by over 10,000 yuan. White Yuan and Yin Yuan rice showed a slight weakening trend. Flour saw some activity in retail sales, rising by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour rebounded by 10,000 yuan, but factories continued to dump stock, resulting in abundant supply and preventing excessive price increases. Bran rose slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

Bean cake from Taiwan saw slight movement, rising by 10,000 yuan. Yellow soybean oil factories were dull, with customers picking and choosing carefully, and local street demand was flat. Du Huang processed oil fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, while customer soybeans showed a similar flat condition. Soybean transactions were quiet, falling again by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.

Cowpeas were selling poorly, declining by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, and red sorghum transactions were scarce, declining by 10,000 yuan.

Raw peanuts were halted by Guanggang merchants, and local street expectations were unenthusiastic, plummeting by 200,000 yuan. Sesame sales were quiet, with out-of-town merchants inactive, continuing to fall by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Milk sesame plummeted by 100,000 yuan, and black sesame plummeted by over 100,000 yuan.

The oil market saw little fluctuation, with mixed price increases and declines. Soybean oil was initially firm but tightened later, rising steadily by 10,000 to 11,000 yuan. Raw oil had ample supply but slow sales, showing weakness with a decline of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil rose slightly by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, vegetable oil saw no significant movement, clear oil remained on a weakening trend, and wheat was strong.

### Light-Colored Woolen Fabrics Flourishing

Transactions in woolen fabrics and goods saw limited actual sales across all channels due to seasonal factors. Among traders, there was mutual buying and selling of spring and summer woolen fabrics, and market prices were generally flourishing. Apart from heavy overcoat woolens, most others rose one after another, with light-colored and light-gray floral woolens being the most popular yesterday. Generally, manufacturers were mostly holding goods and unwilling to sell, and quoted prices were mostly higher than market prices, thereby raising market sentiment.

### Chinese Medicine Turns Firm

The Chinese medicine market, which had been weak for a long time, turned firm. Pepper has been rising steadily for two days. White pepper recently opened for sale at 210,000 yuan. Black pepper sales from the northern regions were brisk, surging to 240,000 yuan. Crude oil also rose to 24,000 yuan. Xi Xiaohui, which had been weak for years, suddenly saw purchases from out-of-town merchants and followed suit, rising sharply. Last week, it was selling for 8,000 yuan with few buyers, but now it has jumped to 20,000 yuan, and supply is still insufficient, leading to a new record of 24,000 yuan.

### Sugar Prices Rise

Yesterday, the grain market saw continued brisk demand, and Taiwan sugar prices rose uniformly. The association set prices, and futures contracts for refined white and coarse white sugar rose by 6-7 percent. Spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar rose by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan, No. 4 half-white sugar rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, and No. 20 medium granulated white sugar rose by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Strong

Yesterday, both local and out-of-town merchants continued to sell domestic tea as usual. There were still many inquiries, but sellers continued to hold firm, so supply and demand were not balanced, and transactions were still limited. However, prices rose significantly compared to the previous day. As for the foreign tea market, prices were also improving due to the positive sentiment of the holders, so although the buying interest of exporters was still hesitant, prices rose across the board.

### Cigarettes Rebound

Yesterday morning, cigarette prices initially rebounded due to the price increase by the Yongtaihe factory, and sellers held firm. Later, it was heard that British Old Knife was distributing goods, and Nanyang Company also announced the allocation of cigarettes, increasing the volume on the market and weakening buying interest. In the afternoon, trading was active in the market, and traders bought up a lot, resulting in a rebound of 400,000 to 800,000 yuan for British Old Knife and Two Cigarettes compared to the previous day. Other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also turned firm.

### Soap Prices High

Although there were rumors of distribution of Gu Ben brand soap, the active new buying resulted in particularly strong transactions and a soaring market. In the end, Gu Ben and Jian Dao soap rose sharply by 167,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Guanghua soap rose rapidly by a significant 200,000 yuan due to its low price and popularity among buyers. Other brands such as Zhu Mao Hengli also rose to the 100,000 yuan range. Both the match and kerosene markets remained brisk.

### Commercial Briefs

China Flying Wheel Thread Factory, with a capital of 24 billion yuan, has been fully paid up. The registration certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be issued soon, and the factory authorities are currently proceeding with the procedures for listing on the stock exchange.

Since the Hebei Bank announced the daily exchange rate between Taiwan currency and legal tender, the allocation price of Taiwan sugar will also be adjusted according to the Taiwan currency exchange rate. The third phase of Taiwan sugar allocation is scheduled to begin on the 15th, and the allocation prices of all grades of sugar will be increased by approximately 10,000 yuan.

In order to thoroughly eliminate speculation, the Gold Inspection Bureau has recently intensified its inspections of the business of banks and merchants. Any customer who issues checks, regardless of the amount, will have their accounts temporarily frozen if the check is found to be related to speculative activities.

For the export of yarn and cloth, the National Yarn and Cloth Management Committee will strengthen unified management. The visa matters will be handled uniformly by the Textile Export Association. The association has been notified to prepare measures and submit them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval.

The recent volume of cash transported to Shanghai has increased significantly. In addition to sending personnel to inspect the exchange business of banks and merchants, the Gold Management Bureau will also telegraph the local branches of the Central Bank to assist in curbing the increase.

The Central Bank announced interest rates for major cities nationwide: (1) The interbank overnight lending rate is highest in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Bengbu, at 6 yuan per thousand. Shanghai is at 4.5 yuan, and Shangrao and four other places are lowest, at 5 jiao per day.

### Explanation of "Returning the Blessing"

— Shi Zhecun

The December issue of Wen Chao Monthly published Mr. Wang Jisi's "Annotations and Supplements to the Five Plays of the Western Chamber," which has been extensively revised from his original work, all of which are carefully considered and admirable. Among them, there is a discussion involving the phrase "Returning the Blessing," which states:

"In the section 'Early Completion of Secret Appointments,' Wang Boliang's version makes this sentence 'Monks often return the blessing of secret appointments.' It should follow Huang Shangu's poem 'I haven't drunk alcohol for ten days due to illness, returning the blessing of youth to later generations.' Ren's note: 'Returning the blessing is probably a Buddhist term. Liu Yuxi's poem: Infinite joy and glory, temporarily return the blessing to young people.'"

According to this, "returning the blessing" is indeed a Buddhist term, and Shangu's poem comes from Liu Yuxi, which is true. However, the sentence in the Western Chamber may not directly use Shangu's poem. Many Song Dynasty collections have used this term, which was common language at the time. Jiang Baishi's poem to Yang Chengzhai says: "Sir, you only have three thousand poems, returning the blessing of the twilight clouds of Jiangdong." The ancestral hall version makes it "dragging back the twilight clouds of Jiangdong," and Hong Gaohua's version makes it "looking back at the twilight clouds of Jiangdong," both of which have lost the original meaning and are therefore falsely modified.

Tao Zhu's Unrecorded Notes record: "Fifteen miles north of Yingyang County, Henan, there is a mountain called Yi Bo Mountain with a cave like three rooms. In the cave, there is a pond, and the water is unfathomable. Those who live here usually stay for no more than a month, and strange things are bound to happen, causing terror and departure. Later, a monk came to live there. One day, while reciting the Lotus Sutra at his desk, suddenly the water in the pond moved, but he thought it was a sign of rain. Suddenly, a white snake emerged from the water, as large as a beam, and approached the monk, circling around him to the left, as high as a chair. The monk was terrified and entered the room, closing the door. Peeking through the crack, the monk had no choice but to loudly say: 'The Dragon King's appearance must be to hear the Sutra. This old monk will lecture on this chapter for the Dragon King.' After finishing, the returning the blessing was barely completed, and the snake entered the pond, circling to the right along the path."

According to this record, returning the blessing seems to have originally been a Buddhist ritual. After lecturing on the Sutra, it was customary to return the blessing. Gao Jiuwan's poem on the Qixi Festival says: "Double stars return the blessing to children, allowing me to fast before the embroidered Buddha." And "Miscellaneous Leisurely Sayings" says: "The wind and floral fragrance are clear, lower the curtain and don't release them, returning the blessing of Buddhist karma, offering this old poetic spirit." Also, Ye Jingwen's poem in the monk's house in Qinghui Pavilion says: "The monk returns the blessing of leisure offerings, placing a tea bowl in the fragrance of orchids and irises." These are all examples of the use of the phrase "returning the blessing" in the poems of the Southern Song Dynasty. Yao Mu'an's "Candlelight Shaking Red" lyrics say: "I wish the blue window could slow down the flow of light, borrowing the sleeves, returning the blessing to the new studio." Then, the Yuan Dynasty still used this phrase. Shi Yuanlong's poem in Huating, "Begging for Alms," says: "Explaining the Sutra to repay the price of rice, returning the blessing aligns with ordinary emotions." Then, people in the early Qing Dynasty still used this phrase in their poems. Generally, common people give monks money and goods, and the monks take only what they need, returning the rest to the givers, which is probably the meaning of returning the blessing. Today, when people in Hangzhou give gifts during the year, they usually return a small amount, called "returning a little," which is probably a transformation of "returning the blessing." From this, it can be seen that "returning the blessing" means "returning a gift" or "repaying." It originates from Buddhism, and its meaning is knowable, but its ritual is unknowable.

### Manwang Cave - Travelogue of Jia Prefecture

— Ye Dingluo

Regarding this Manwang Cave, some say it is from the Han Dynasty. Before there is a way to verify whether it is true or false, I think it is interesting to visit it as a strange place. I heard that there is a larger Quanwang Cave in the northwest suburbs outside Jia Prefecture City. My friend and I took advantage of a sunny autumn day for a walk and went from the fields, passing several small streams and wooden bridges, behind the village, at the foot of a low hill, and found the Manwang Cave.

This is a kind of construction of primitive human dwellings. A cave is carved out of the side of a stone mountain. The cave door is square, and the height and width of many caves are about three zhang and one zhang. The stone above the cave entrance is mostly carved with patterns, and some are carved with the name of the cave the size of a tabletop. Needless to say, this is the pattern of later busybodies. Inside some caves, figures are carved in relief on the stone walls. From the appearance and the method of carving, one can also discern its primitiveness.

After passing a wooden house feeding cattle, walking past the bodies of many water buffalo standing in the way, we saw from afar that Manwang Cave stood darkly on the mountain. Climbing up the earthen slope, we saw the true nature of these caves. They were purely carved from the yellow stones on the mountain. The reason why they were not completely covered by trees is that they have become "historical sites," and many later generations often come here to explore, just like unattended ancient temples, with the doorway overgrown with kudzu vines and ancient grasses.

I walked up the earthen slope to explore a more majestic cave. The three huge characters "Baiyun Cave" in a dangerous script were carved on the stone wall at the cave entrance. This cave door stands side by side, but the inside is actually an open and interconnected cave. In the stone enclosure, there is a place the size of a household affair. There are many inscriptions on the stone walls. I wanted to find the history of this cave from the words of this inscription, but those words were only records of later generations visiting here, and were really unrelated to the cave itself. I smiled to myself in vain, feeling that I was the same as these Tang and Song people who left their names and records, unable to know the origin of this cave. I thought that the people who knew the origin of this cave would definitely not recognize these clerical and regular scripts, because this cave was probably carved out an unknown number of years before these scripts were produced.

The back wall of this cave, like two doors for people to enter and exit on a stage, has two smaller caves standing on the left and right. Inside these caves are two deep tunnels. The depths of the tunnels obviously slope downwards. There are still places I want to go into, but fear stopped my legs. Although I guessed that there would be no wild animals inside, many imaginings of being alone in the stone caves of this deserted mountain really made me dare not go any further. In the stone ground I walked on, a stone crack opened, revealing that there was still a stone room below the stone ground, and there were stone-made objects that seemed to be used for water storage. On the walls of each cave entrance, there are deeply carved stone depressions, which seem to be used for embedding wooden tenons. The square edges of the stone doors are carved with simple patterns, making one imagine that the humans who initially used this as a room carefully designed their living space, and the overall structure of this cave is actually the prototype of later Chinese houses.

Several banana trees were specially planted at this cave entrance. I was very surprised why this kind of garden design of later generations would be added to the entrance of this desolate cave. Later, according to a friend, this was the remnant of an officer who took refuge here during the bombing during the Anti-Japanese War. The green banana trees could both protect the cave door and provide shade, so the officer used this cave as a place to avoid danger, or perhaps to study Sun Tzu's Art of War and infantry drill manuals. Our ancestors really planned too carefully for their descendants.

Around the foot of the mountain of this cave, about half a mile away, there is an even larger cave. A large stone wall stands smoothly on the equally smooth stone slope, and three caves almost the size of city gates are carved out. From a distance, it really has the feeling of a city gate, but this has been blocked by an earthen slope. Even the square cave doors that can only be seen inside are covered by earthen mounds. The interior structure of this cave is really unknown. This cave and the cave with banana trees at the entrance stand on opposite sides of the mountain. I guess that the insides of these two caves may have connecting places. If archaeologists are willing to excavate here, or there may be connecting places, if archaeologists are willing to excavate in here, or they may discover many historical proofs.

In addition to these two larger caves, there are many such smaller caves on the nearby mountains. From the shape of these caves, one can imagine the situation of ancient cave dwellings. Now, these caves have been buried in barren mountains. After being tired of wandering, when leaving these barren mountains and walking back again, seeing today's suburbs and cities, it seems that I have stretched my life upwards, walking in history, and placing myself between ancient and modern times.

### Lichee Poem

— Zhu

"Changan looking to make into a pile, the top of mountain thousand doors gradually open, a riding red dust concubine smiling, no one knows it is lichee coming." This is Du Mu's writing, Qing Palace time also. According to the New Tang History Yang Guifei Biography: The concubine loved lichees, and must have them delivered fresh. So riders were sent to deliver them, traveling thousands of miles. Before the taste changed, they had arrived in the capital. Du's poem probably sings about this. Old Study Hermitage Records records that Emperor Huizong planted lichees that bore fruit under the Baohe Hall during the Xuanhe period, and Emperor Huizong personally picked them to give to Yan commander Wang Anzhong, and also gave them a poem: "Baohe Hall's lichees are red, civil and military officials are given hundreds, thinking to share this taste with court ministers, red dust flies quickly past Yanshan," the last sentence uses Du's meaning.

### Call

— Written by Polish A. Asnyk, Translated by Chen Mei

Outside the storm, there is a call from time to time,

Floating to those thoughtless, wicked, and fat ears.

Floating to those leaders enslaved by lies,

A call acting strangely in the wilderness.

It pierces the heart like an unexpected thought,

But no one jumps up from bed;

People shudder, like murderers just caught,

But pay no attention to what the call says.

Because no one can understand or hear

The call howling outside the scenery;

They turn over and fall into a soft sleep again,

And never dream of repentance and reform.

Adam Asnyk (1838-1897), a Polish poet. Born in Kalisz, he studied medicine in Warsaw and Heidelberg, Germany. After graduating, he practiced medicine in Laucheng. After 1870, he practiced medicine in Krakow. He wrote poetry in his spare time, mostly inclined to philosophy. The general reader thinks that Chen's meaning is too high. This chapter is translated from "Polish Lyrical Poetry Treasury", edited by Kou Kang Nai'er, published by Canadian Polish Printing House.

### Reading Paintings by Tian Jiweng

— Wu Lifu

The art of painting, character, and the process of painting by Tian Jiweng, a famous landscape painter from Shanyin, have already been introduced in an article by my cousin Huang Hua. Yesterday, I went to the Chinese Painting Academy to visit Jiweng's painting exhibition. I felt that his style was close to several painters from the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, and he was particularly rich in comprehensive power. Now I will try to analyze it. This is also a method of reading paintings, and it is worth discussing with people who appreciate art.

Jiweng's composition is also very dense, with not much blank space on the screen. He takes inspiration from Luntai and Shigu, with clear veins, close to Luntai, and intentionally loose, close to Shigu. Jiweng's brushwork is divided into three types: one tends to be thick and layered, using the method of Long Banqian; one strives for sharpness and strength, which is close to Lan Tianshu; and one intends to be sparse and elegant, with many edges and corners, quite similar to Wang Shigu. As for coloring, it is mainly based on light ochre.

Jiweng has given a harmonious integration of the faces of these Ming and Qing masters in his works, and his main reliance is on the point method. His points follow the method of Zhonggui, and occasionally use Er Mi. For example, in the large painting "Spring Mountain Desiring Rain," the overlapping cloud mountains in the upper half are purely made of Mi dots, and the pine stones and flowing springs in the lower half are dedicated to learning from Diersou, and it is indeed not easy to achieve a complete atmosphere. As for what I like the most, it is two small paintings, one learning Luntai's "Spring Dawn at Lake Village" and one learning Yunlin while also learning Xiangbi's "Distant Cen on the Shore."

Such an analysis may be very mechanical. I also hope that Jiweng and connoisseurs will give me guidance.

### In the Mire

— Li Baifeng

In the mire of the city, I am a sufferer of the soul.

Like a fish that has lost water, on a starless and moonless winter night, I am deeply mired in the mire of sin. Although my conscience has not yet fallen asleep, I am already covered in mud. Swallowing dirty mud, I follow those mudskippers who are good at maneuvering, tumbling in the mire, looking for nutritious food... Just living like this, painfully and helplessly -

My pen has long been no longer irrigating on my manuscript paper for my soul, because the source of that conscience has also become turbid, and no drop of water has become a mud spring; ah! My conscience's mud spring, which cannot be drawn from, as a me who is unwilling to drown myself, can I forever fall into degradation for the sake of rice and millet?

However, the night is so deep, without a star to accompany me, without the peaceful scene of roosters crowing and dogs barking. Even though I see more, I think more. How will I use this withered pen?

In the mire of the city, I illuminate the lamp of conscience and wander everywhere. I see how the people in the bitter and sinking world are living numbly and numbly. I cannot but feel that I am not prepared enough.

Originally, a person who can visualize life from observation, the sparks of his thoughts are always smoking, and the source of his wisdom will never run dry; I have always considered and expected myself to be a person who can think, but in such a mire, because of an accidental "fall", the source of conscience has become defiled, not to mention drawing water from here to irrigate, even I myself am unwilling to draw a drop to drink.

I tumbled helplessly in this mire. I saw how the "operators" whose gorgeous clothes were covered with thick mud were breathing with their lungs, but in fact, I was also forced to breathe like this, experiencing with my mouth instead of my soul.

From this small point of feeling, I understand how some people live. The deeper they fall, the greater the pain, and at the same time, they cannot make a sound, because the muddy conscience has no more reaction, like a mudskipper, which is originally a cold-blooded animal -

Therefore, I don't think the city is a big pot. In the boiling mud, these suffering mudskippers endure pain and exclude each other. Perhaps some people think that they can't make a sound of pain, so they think that they enjoy this kind of life, but that's wrong. I know that the reason why they have no sound is precisely because this is an era that does not allow sound.

Will there never be a sound made like this forever? I believe that it will not be too long. Mudskippers originally have vocal organs, and although the power of tumbling is weak, it will eventually turn this big pot over because of excessive extortion. Yes, at that time, people will go to places without fire, and the road will also be trodden out by people's feet.

### Recent World of Literature

— Zhao Jingshen

A New Study of the Brontës

Recently, England seems to be quite interested in the female writer Brontë. First, the Pilot Press published "Novels by the Brontë Sisters," priced at sixteen shillings. This collection includes Charlotte's "Jane Eyre," Emily's "Wuthering Heights," and Anne's "Agnes Grey."

Phyllis Bentley, herself a novelist from Yorkshire, wrote a book titled "The Brontë Sisters" for the British Novelists series. It begins by describing their family environment and upbringing, then narrates their lives and works separately, concluding with the position of this commendable family in English literature.

They are the admirable trio of the capable and decisive Charlotte, the unique Emily, and the gentle and respectful Anne. Modern times also have such a trio, namely the Sitwell family, with Edith, Osbert, and Sacheverell.

In the Brontë family, we cannot forget Branwell. Their father had six children, but only Branwell was a son, the other five being daughters. The eldest two sisters died early, the third sister was Charlotte, Branwell was the fourth child, Emily was the fifth, and Anne was the sixth. Although Branwell was also a writer and artist, he did not achieve much. He was the failure of the family, the weakest member, only bringing shame and sorrow to the family. Did he drink because he was ashamed of not being able to keep up with his sisters' genius? Without Branwell, would they have been able to write masterpieces? Would Charlotte have been so capable and confident? Would Emily have reached such depths of despair and pity? Would the most honest and benevolent Anne have written about the chronic suicide of a drunkard in Wildfell Hall? Strangely, Branwell was indeed necessary for the development of their genius; without him, there would have been no masterpieces.

Bentley traced the origins of the Brontë sisters' literary flowering, saying that they were originally Celts who later moved to Yorkshire. Bentley said that although they wrote about Yorkshire, their attitude was Celtic. They wrote about the Yorkshire they knew, and they wrote it as well as it could be written, but what they brought us was the Irish tradition of "sentiment, poetry, fire, and ice." This biography is rich in material and meticulous in its records. It emphasizes the importance of the family's dream world and writes about many sources of their works.

Lang's "English Literature" states: "Charlotte (1816-1855) wanted to depict her novels as social realism. She added a passionate essence to Thackeray's realism, with a touch of unbalanced romanticism. The latter was partly an expression of Charlotte's own nature and partly the result of her lonely and sad life, which was darkened by constant family tragedies. This will help us understand her work if we remember that Charlotte and her sister Emily turned to literature because they found their work as teachers unbearable and wanted to create a new world of fantasy to relieve the loneliness and sadness of their own fate. However, in this new world, the sadness of thought remained, so there was a painful heart behind all of Charlotte's novels. Charlotte's most famous work is 'Jane Eyre' (1847), which, despite its shortcomings, is a powerful study of essential love and hate, reminiscent of Marlowe's tragedies. This work was immediately praised by the public, and the author was listed among the leading living writers. In addition to the value of the novel itself, it is interesting that the first few chapters reflect the author's own life and experiences. 'Shirley' (1849) and 'Villette' (1853) are the three novels by this genius woman that are often remembered." Lang also said that Emily's (1818-1848) "Wuthering Heights" is about intense, morbid love and endurance. Arnold (M. Arnold) called her writing passionate, powerful, and sad, unmatched by anyone except [Lord] Byron. Charlotte has a detailed description of Emily in the novel "Shirley."

Thomas Mann Writes About Moses

After working hard to recreate the story of Joseph and his brothers, the German Thomas Mann is now recreating the story of Moses, which is smaller in quantity but not without similarities in nature. The story is called "The Tables of the Law." The original was published in a collection of essays written by various authors in 1945. The English translation was only recently published.

He uses reason to write about Moses and the establishment of the Ten Commandments, without any mythical elements. Moses is the child of Pharaoh's daughter. Thomas Mann gives rational explanations for all the miraculous or semi-miraculous events.

Based on his imagination, he says that Moses has a slightly hooked nose, speaks with a bit of a stutter, and has very strong arms. Thomas Mann's works have never been strongly stimulating when translated into English, but the translation of this novel is relatively fluent. The translator, who unfortunately remains anonymous, uses American dialects and idioms to make the story lively.

New Collection of Poems by Todd

Ruthven Todd is a new poet who emerged in England during the war. He has previously published the collections of poems "Until Now" (1942) and "Acreage of the Heart" (1945), as well as the novel "The Lost Traveller" (1944), and has also edited a biography of the poet Blake (1942). Now he has published this book, "The Planet in My Hand." He is rich in sensitive expression. He believes that although "man" is prone to tragedy, he also has great strength. He often sings about his love, his son, and his father. His "In Memory of Dad" says: "When I last saw him, lying restlessly in bed, I knew I had finally grown up. As long as I think of him, all my hatred and fear disappear."

He also has historical poems like Swift, but his best poem is "Edinburgh, 1940."

He often feels disillusioned and uneasy. At the beginning of the war, he sadly sang: "I appeal to the midsummer moon, what can I do? I want to avoid the torrent of history, where can I escape?"

### The Past and Present of Shanghai's Radio Broadcasting Industry

— Shi Yingyang, Qian Zhixi

The Initial Stage

Radio broadcasting experiments by wireless radio scholars in Europe and the United States were declared successful in 1920 (the ninth year of the Republic of China). Radio stations were widely established, and the broadcasting of programs was effective. Two years later (the eleventh year of the Republic of China), a British Jew, E. C. Osborne, installed a 50-watt radio broadcasting station at the Dale & Co. on Guangdong Road in Shanghai, with the call sign ECO, broadcasting news, lectures, music, and other programs. At the same time, an electrical appliance company (Electric Equipment & Co.) was attached to an optical company on Nanjing Road to promote the sale of various electrical equipment through radio programs. However, the radio station's equipment was simple, the sound was unclear, and it failed to arouse interest from all walks of life. Therefore, the radio station and the company closed down in a few months. Thirteen years later, Delay, the manager of the American Kellogg Telephone Supplies Company, founded a radio station, broadcasting news, commercial information, church programs, celebrity lectures, and advertisements for the company's products, with the power increasing from 100 watts to 250 watts. In the sixteenth year, it stopped broadcasting due to low profits. However, broadcasting over the air lasted for three years, making it the first successful broadcaster in Shanghai during its initial stage. Subsequently, foreigners successively established radio stations, including Mei (XMHA), Qimei (XQHE), Datong (XQHA), the British merchant Qikai (i.e., the Robertson Radio Station) (XQHB), Meilington (XQHC), and the French merchant Falun (XFFZ), totaling six stations.

The Era of State-Owned and Private Enterprises

By the seventeenth year, China, seeing the rampant and endless proliferation of Western radio stations, began to operate its own radio stations. First, the former Beijing Ministry of Communications and the Northeast Wireless Radio Supervision Office successively established radio stations in Beijing, Tianjin, Fengtian, and Harbin. Later, the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters established the Central Broadcasting Administration. It initially established a powerful radio station in the capital (increasing from 500 watts to 50 kilowatts), followed by branch stations in important provinces and cities. At the same time, the Zhejiang Provincial Government also established a 1-kilowatt radio station. By the twenty-third year, the Ministry of Communications also established a station (XQHC) as an advocate.

With the government leading the way, private radio stations sprung up like mushrooms after the rain. In Shanghai alone, there were as many as forty or fifty stations. However, the quality of the equipment of each station varied, and they interfered with each other. Therefore, in the twenty-first year, the Ministry of Communications promulgated the Provisional Rules for the Administration of Private Radio Broadcasting Stations, stipulating that each station should first apply for registration and wait for inspection of the equipment. Those who passed the inspection would be granted a license before being allowed to establish a station and start broadcasting. The program content should focus on promoting education and culture, and commercial programs were severely restricted, not exceeding two-tenths of the daily broadcasting time. At that time, after several negotiations, all foreign radio stations, except for the French station, which insisted on its independence and refused to register, came to register. Subsequently, the Meilington and Qimei stations were revoked by the Ministry of Communications. The equipment of all Chinese merchant radio stations was inspected by personnel from the Ministry of Communications, and the programs were reviewed and handled by the Central Broadcasting Steering Committee. As a result of several years of supervision, the equipment of each station was gradually improved. However, there was a lack of good programs, and they competed to attract a large number of lengthy commercial advertisements with low-level entertainment programs, while the proportion of educational lectures and high-quality entertainment programs was not increased, which was regrettable.

The War of Resistance Period

In the twenty-sixth year, the August 13th Incident of the War of Resistance broke out, and after three months of bloody fighting, the national army retreated, and the forty-odd private radio stations in Shanghai were in a state of chaos. The Chinese Mei and Qikai stations among the foreign stations were shut down after the Japanese invaded the concessions. The Datong station was sold to the Japanese and moved to the Huangpu Wharf, where it was bombed and destroyed by Allied aircraft. The French station continued broadcasting due to its relationship with the Vichy government. Some Chinese merchant radio stations, greedy for business, shamelessly served the enemy and continued broadcasting. Later, more than ten new radio stations were established and were collectively bought and controlled by the Japanese. However, the Linji and Heming stations stopped broadcasting due to being in the war zone in Nanshi. The other stations, such as Shanghai (i.e., Asia-America), Yuanchang, Huamei, Greater China, Mainland, and Oriental Gospel, automatically closed down after the national army retreated.

The Post-Victory Reorganization Period

In September of the thirty-fourth year, the War of Resistance was won. Before the restoration of various institutions of the central government was completed and the rules for the establishment of radio stations were promulgated by the Executive Yuan, Chinese and Western private and party-government-military institutions competed to establish radio stations, and the number increased daily. The broadcasting frequencies were crowded, and the equipment was mostly outdated and mismatched, causing abnormal problems, resulting in chaotic radio waves, mutual interference, and rough sound, which was unbearable to listen to. Although the garrison headquarters and the police department initially took temporary responsibility for management, they ultimately failed to achieve reorganization results because there were no suitable regulations to follow. It was not until March of the thirty-fifth year that this bureau promulgated the rules for the establishment of radio stations and first handled the registration of public and private radio stations as a preliminary reorganization. A total of 106 stations were found to have complied with the order to register. This bureau, together with the garrison headquarters and the police department, sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections of the transmitters and broadcasting equipment of each station. However, the quality of the equipment varied, so the three parties jointly determined the levels, listed them, and reported them to the Ministry of Communications. With approval, six stations, including China, Freedom, Asia, Cooperation, Jindou, Minsheng, and Jiujiu, were temporarily allowed to broadcast. Seven stations, including Chinese Culture, Jiancheng, Greater China, Datong, New Voice, New Shanghai, and Hezhong, were ordered to improve their machinery before being temporarily allowed to broadcast. Furthermore, radio stations that had voluntarily ceased operations during the War of Resistance and refused to register with the enemy and puppet regime were specially allowed to broadcast with priority, including Mainland, Greater China, Oriental, Huamei, Yuanchang, Heming, and Gospel. Subsequently, Xin Yun and Da Mei were also approved to broadcast. All of the above twenty stations used one frequency for every two stations, taking turns broadcasting to reduce the congestion and interference of frequencies. In addition, the Xindu station was approved to only broadcast meeting programs when the Municipal Council was in session, and broadcasting would be stopped after the meeting was adjourned. The Shanghai Radio Station, which was established by the former Central Broadcasting Administration, will be changed to a private enterprise, affiliated with the China Broadcasting Company, and is currently being organized and applied for in accordance with the law. This is the general situation of restoring order in the air after the recovery of the various stations. As for unscrupulous people who privately set up radio stations for the purpose of making profits by indiscriminately soliciting commercial advertisements and selling inferior goods, there are still many, and they are currently being investigated and cracked down on one after another, and it is expected that they will be cleared up soon.

Hopes for the Future

The radio broadcasting industry is a tool for promoting laws and decrees, developing culture, and enlightening the people. It should not be solely for the purpose of soliciting commercial advertisements and seeking profits as its main business. However, looking around today, the content of the programs of each station is largely similar. Not only are there many commercial programs in private party stations, but also many public radio stations privately broadcast commercial programs. Here are a few points, and it is hoped that each station will automatically improve: In terms of programs, emphasis should be placed on education and culture. In terms of educational transmission, songs, lyrics, and musical drama lyrics, we must take a high standard. Although popular, it should not be inelegant, and all obscene words and songs that are harmful to public morals should be eliminated. It is hoped that the education authorities will come forward to assist in rectifying and correcting the customs. As for commercial programs, we should strive to reduce the proportion. Currently, a single advertisement for commercial programs is broadcast, and even takes up to ten minutes or more. If three or four advertisements are broadcast at the same time, the time occupied is even more. Moreover, the words and sentences read in the advertisements are repeated over and over again, just like monks chanting scriptures, which only makes the audience bored and switch to other stations. As a result, the effectiveness of the advertisement is completely lost, and the merchant has been deceived and wasted money. In the past, the Ministry of Communications Radio Station signed up for various publicity advertisement programs, limiting each household to only two minutes of broadcasting, broadcasting once every half hour, and limiting each broadcast to three or four households at the same time, occupying only six to eight minutes. In the future, it seems that each station should imitate this, receiving concise advertisements that emphasize quality rather than quantity. Although the time occupied is short, the effect is great. If we intend to accept lengthy advertisements indiscriminately, which are not noticed by the general public, it is a self-deceiving act. We hope that each station will improve this. I checked the equipment of each station, and most of it is not yet perfect. As a result, we cannot eliminate the generation of sub-waves, the expansion of wave bands, and the noise of AC sound. Not only is the sound unpleasant, but mutual interference is also common. If the technical aspects continue in this way and are not improved, allowing the Shanghai radio waves to be disordered, it will hinder international viewing and listening and bring shame to the country. All of us in the wireless radio technology field also ask ourselves with shame, and especially hope that the person in charge of each station will pay attention and improve it.

### Everyone Has Something to Say

— Su Yu

### Talking About Coastal Radio Stations

— Sun Jizun

Coastal radio stations – except for shipping companies and a few people, they seem relatively unfamiliar to the general public, because everyone knows that the Telecommunications Bureau receives and sends domestic telegrams, and international radio stations receive and send foreign telegrams. But what about coastal radio stations? It is not very clear what they do. So today I will introduce the general idea of coastal radio stations to you, which I think you will be happy to hear.

A coastal radio station is an institution on land that specializes in communicating with ocean and inland river ships (equipped with wireless radio equipment). The purpose of its establishment is for maritime safety, so its biggest task is also biased towards maritime safety. Although it also accepts public communications and receives and sends telegrams to and from ships like the Telecommunications Bureau and international radio stations, this is a secondary task. Its main special tasks are roughly the following:

Listening for Distress Signals The work of a coastal radio station is a 24-hour system. Every minute of attention is devoted to listening, and in addition to receiving and sending a few telegrams, the most sacred and important task is to listen for distress and rescue signals (SOS) from ships (or airplanes, etc.) at sea. If this signal is heard, even if it is currently communicating, it will immediately stop and listen quietly to the distress message (including the name of the ship, its nationality, the date, time, and location of the distress – latitude and longitude – and the distress situation). It immediately notifies the relevant parties, such as the shipping company, the Jianghai Customs, the port authority, etc., and broadcasts it on their behalf, requesting nearby ships to go to the rescue until the danger is over.

Broadcasting Time Signals and Weather Forecasts Every day at a set time, time signals are sent to calibrate the time, and weather information is sent to allow ships in navigation to know the changes in the weather. In the typhoon season, if a storm is detected, it must be broadcast at all times so that ships in navigation know where to avoid it.

Issuing Navigation Warnings If anything dangerous to navigation is found in the ocean, broadcast it at any time, such as mines left over from wartime, or the discovery of reefs, or floating obstacles, and sunken ships, etc., as well as any obstacles or changes in the position of lighthouses and buoys in the navigation route, warnings must be sent at any time to prompt ships to pay attention to ensure safe navigation.

Navigation Status Reports Every day, the port of entry and exit of various ships, and the location of navigation in what place, how much distance apart, must be recorded for reference, and at the same time, because of this close contact with the ships that come and go, it is convenient and assured to exchange telegrams.

Epidemic Reports The announcement of an epidemic in a port that requires quarantine, will inform passengers to pay attention. If a passenger is ill, the coastal radio station can also transfer it to health and medical institutions for answers.

Broadcasting News, Direction Finding A fully equipped coastal radio station has these facilities that facilitates navigation and increases maritime safety.

The tasks mentioned above are the special tasks of coastal radio stations, which are completely free and voluntary services, and are mostly handled in advance. Ordinary telecommunications are secondary, so they put service first and business second, but the two are linked. The more attentive the service, the more developed the business. The soundness of the coastal radio station has a huge impact on aviation, and the equipment must be as complete as possible. Developed countries in Europe and the United States regard coastal radio stations as being related to navigation safety and to domestic and foreign affairs, and attach great importance to it.

Ship Telegrams All telegrams to and from coastal radio stations and ships, or between ships, are called ship telegrams, which are now divided into international ship telegrams and domestic ship telegrams.

International Ship Telegrams The way to calculate the cost of this telegram is the same as for international telegrams, calculated according to the gold franc, ninety centimes per word, including fifty centimes for the coastal fee (calculated according to the current franc exchange rate, recently adjusted from October 13 this year to 18,000 yuan per gold franc), and forty centimes for the ship fee. Both Chinese and foreign languages are the same, but there is no "urgent telegram" category. If the code CDE is used, it is calculated at six-tenths.

Domestic Ship Telegrams All ships of this country that have been approved by the Ministry of Communications to issue wireless radio station certificates and call signs can calculate the cost of domestic ship telegrams. The current price is 1,500 yuan per word for Chinese and vernacular, including 1,000 yuan for the domestic telegram fee and 500 yuan for the ship telegram fee. Foreign languages or codes are calculated at twice the price, and urgent telegrams are calculated at twice the price of ordinary telegrams. The ship fee is still charged according to the ordinary telegram fee.

The existing coastal radio stations in China are Tianjin XSV, Qingdao XST, and Yingkou XSD in the north, Shanghai XSG in the central region, and Tainan XSW, Keelung XSX, and Hualien Port XSY in the south. The riverbank radio stations along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are Nanjing XSM, Jiujiang XSK, Hankou XSN, Yichang XSO, and Chongqing XSP. The business office of the Shanghai Coastal Radio Station is located at 25 Changzhi Road in this city, telephone 44882–45747.

Coastal radio stations that are being planned are Qinhuangdao XSV3, Huludao XSV4, Yantai XSC, Lianyungang XST3, Guangzhou XSQ, Shantou XSQ3, Haikou XSQ4, Fuzhou XSL, Xiamen XSL2, Yongjia XSL3, Ningbo XSR2, and riverbank radio stations are Hangzhou XSR, Zhenjiang XSM3, Wuhu XSM4, XSG2, Changsha XSN3, Yueyang XSN4, Shashi XSO2, and Wanxian XSP3.

People in our country, except for shipping companies, rarely use ship telegrams. If you have relatives and friends traveling on ships, and you want to know where they are traveling and when they will arrive, or if you have urgent matters that you want them to know immediately, as well as people who are guests on ships and have something to communicate with their families or relatives and friends, and even to contact official business and inquire about commercial information, you can send a few ship telegrams, and the coastal radio station will provide you with loyal and practical services. Then, even if they are separated by the ocean, in different places, and thousands of miles apart, it is as if they are facing each other. The so-called "a little spiritual rhinoceros penetrates to each other," and when the telegram arrives, it is as if they are facing each other in the same room.

Cai Nanshi took photos of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's demonstration business office and the coastal radio station's business office (25 Changzhi Road).

### Talk on Common Telegraph Knowledge

— Zhang Jiayu

Lecture 3 How to Choose Special Services

The above three types of special services have relatively widespread uses. The following types have narrower uses. To save space, we will discuss them more simply.

Delivery Confirmation Before discussing the main topic, please think in advance: Under what circumstances should we use "double registration" when mailing items? As far as the author knows, in various countries in Europe and America (especially the United States), because the postal service is reliable, ordinary mail is usually sent by regular mail. Unless it is particularly important, "single registration" is rarely used. As for double registered mail, unless the sender wants to obtain a double registered receipt as legal evidence, it is not easily sent. Taking the handling of telegrams as an example, when the sender submits any type of telegram, the telegraph office must issue a telegraph receipt. If the telegram cannot be delivered, the telegraph office is responsible for notifying the sender. The handling procedure is more thorough than sending regular mail. In other words, if the sender does not receive a notice from the telegraph office regarding non-delivery after the telegram is sent, it confirms that the telegram has been delivered accurately and can be assured without worry. Therefore, regarding the "delivery confirmation" special service, which is similar in nature to "registered" mail, the author believes that unless: 1. The sender wants to obtain "delivery confirmation" as legal evidence; or 2. Due to special reasons (such as natural disasters or war in the receiving area, causing difficulties in telecommunications, etc.), the telegraph office announces that it is not responsible for delays or non-delivery of telegrams to that area, senders may consider using the "delivery confirmation" special service for prudence. Otherwise, there is usually no need to choose this special service.

Delivery confirmation is divided into delivery notification by telegram (identified as PC) and delivery notification by letter (identified as PCP). The former means that after the receiving telegraph office delivers the telegram, it notifies the sending telegraph office of the delivery date and time, which is then forwarded to the original sender. The fee for the delivery notification by telegram special service is the original telegram fee plus six words at the ordinary telegram rate. The latter means that after the telegram is delivered, the receiving telegraph office uses mail to notify the sending telegraph office of the delivery date and time, which is then forwarded to the original sender. In addition to the telegram fee itself, a single registered letter postage is added according to the post office regulations.

Special Delivery In principle, telegraph offices do not charge for delivering telegrams (except for express telegrams). However, for telegrams delivered to recipients who live far from the urban area or city center, the telegraph office must send a special messenger, which requires more manpower. Therefore, recipients must be charged a special delivery fee.

Each telegraph office has a free delivery area for ordinary telegrams. According to usual regulations, ordinary telegrams delivered within the city, within the city walls, or within two kilometers of the urban area or city walls are not subject to delivery fees.

For telegrams where the recipient lives outside the free delivery area of the receiving telegraph office but within forty kilometers of the telegraph office location, if the sender indicates "special delivery" or the =EXPRESS= identifier in the telegram header, the receiving telegraph office can send a special messenger. Otherwise, after receiving the telegram, unless the recipient living outside the free delivery area has a large number of telegrams on weekdays and agrees to send someone to the telegraph office at a fixed time every day to collect them, the telegram will be delivered by the post office and no special messenger will be sent.

According to regulations, the special delivery fee must be collected from the recipient. Starting from the telegraph office or business office that dispatches the telegram, one unit of special delivery fee is charged for distances not exceeding ten kilometers, and one unit is added for each additional one to five kilometers. The unit price of the special delivery fee is calculated based on one-fourth of the daily wage of a local worker. Therefore, the fees charged by telegraph offices vary from place to place.

Based on the above regulations, when a sender prepares to send a telegram to a recipient and knows that the recipient's address is outside the free delivery area of the receiving telegraph office, they should consider in advance. If they believe that the local rural postal service delivers quickly, there is no need to add the "special delivery" identifier in the telegram header. Conversely, if it is deemed necessary to request the receiving telegraph office to send a special messenger, this identifier can be added to the telegram header. However, labor costs have recently become expensive, and the special delivery fee is calculated based on labor costs and is required to be paid by the recipient. Therefore, before adding the "special delivery" identifier, the recipient's burden must also be considered.

Forwarding The forwarding special service is best used for telegrams sent to travelers. There are two ways to use the forwarding special service. First, for telegrams sent to travelers, if you know in advance the places they will arrive at and the addresses where they plan to stay after arriving at each place, but cannot determine where the recipient has arrived, you can list the place names and addresses of each arrival place one by one and add the "forward" or =FS= identifier in the telegram header. For example: The general manager, Huang Renfeng, of the Shanghai Dazhong Bank's head office is departing from Shanghai to inspect the business of the bank's Nanjing, Hankou, and Chongqing branch offices. There is an important matter in Shanghai that requires sending him a telegram, but it cannot be determined where the recipient has arrived. In this case, simply indicate the =FS= identifier in the telegram header and list the addresses in various places as follows:

=FS= Huang Renfeng, Dazhong Bank, Zhongshan East Road, Nanjing = Dazhong Bank, Hubei Road, Hankou = Dazhong Bank, Zhongshan First Road, Chongqing = (followed by the text of the telegram and signature)

After the Nanjing Telegraph Office receives this telegram from Shanghai, it will immediately inquire with the Nanjing Dazhong Bank whether the recipient is currently in Nanjing. If he has already left, the original telegram will be forwarded to Hankou for attempted delivery. The Hankou Telegraph Office will also handle it in the same way, until the telegram is delivered.

### Lamenting the Money Class

— Meng Nong

Egyptian Queen Cleopatra was famous for her extravagant lifestyle. She liked to drink special wines, and it is said that there were four pearls at the bottom of the wine bottle.

In ancient Roman times, emperors also went to great lengths to be extravagant. They used peacock brains and tongues to make sandwiches as food.

Unfortunately, today's money class cannot enjoy these things, no matter how much money you have. Because this is a bygone era. Now, apart from ham sandwiches, beef sandwiches, etc., where can you enjoy antique peacock brain sandwiches? And how can you eat more banquets than your great chefs?

Furthermore, watching a play is a form of enjoyment in life, and so is wearing clothes. True, it is indeed enjoyment. However, can you, the money class, wear two or three sets of beautiful suits and overcoats at the same time? Can you watch consecutive performances in two or three theaters in one night?

It is futile to hope that you enjoy the unnecessary huge wealth because you like money. This is like asking the children of a candy factory to work two hours more every day because the children like to eat candy, because having money does not necessarily mean you can enjoy everything. Not everything can be bought or enjoyed with money. This situation is like the children of the candy factory having candy in the factory but not being able to eat it.

The salaried class is different. If they can get double the salary, their enjoyment in life will also double. An income of 10 million yuan per month is indeed twice as enjoyable as 5 million yuan. But the money class is different. They roll, roll, roll their money every day into a huge number that they themselves cannot accurately estimate. But what relationship does this large amount of money have with their enjoyment of life? I believe that natural limitations have long given a certain limit to the enjoyment of life, and the money class is far above this limit, and enjoyment becomes fantasy. They fantasize about this and that, like the glass merchant Alnaschar in "One Thousand and One Nights," fantasizing that one day, they will marry a queen-like wife, and in front of her, they will show off their power, put on airs, lose their temper, and kick her out. With this kick, they shattered their dreams and fantasies! It turned out that he was not kicking his "queen," but kicking his wealth (glassware), the glass shattered into pieces, and all the wealth was gone!

A gold ring may decorate you, but countless gold bars will only bind you and restrict you. A big meal can fill your stomach and provide you with the necessary nutrition, but if you eat one meal after another, and eat too much, not only will you not be able to digest it, but your stomach will probably be damaged. For the money class who have eaten too much and damaged their stomachs, and have been imprisoned, will anyone sympathize with them? On the contrary, those who deserve pity or sympathy are those poor people who are exposed to the cold wind and cannot get enough food and clothing, including some of the salaried class. Will the confiscated money give those suffering people a little of the food and clothing they deserve? I am thinking about this.

### I Do Not Choose Freedom

— Ze Shi

I saw a strange book in the advertisement of paintings and books in the newspaper, called "I Chose Freedom." I don't know what the content is, why did that person choose freedom? Which things did he choose from? If it were me, then if someone listed two other things besides freedom, such as arsenic, and ordered me to choose, then I would of course choose freedom, but if arsenic were replaced by rice cakes and bread, and listed alongside freedom, and ordered me to choose, to be honest, I would necessarily give up freedom and choose rice cakes or bread, if this choice is to let me choose freely.

Because the freedom that people talk about from ancient times to the present refers to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of association. Freedom of love and freedom of marriage are not included, and freedom to eat bread and freedom to eat rice are even more insignificant and excluded from the topic, so I have no intention of choosing freedom. Originally, among the three major freedoms of speech, assembly, and society, I fundamentally dislike the latter two. Gathering many Zhang Sans, Li Sis, Sun Qis, and Huang Bas in one place, everyone says their own reasoning, opinions are never easy to agree on, conclusions are never easy to reach, and besides wasting time, losing work, and wasting money, there is nothing good, so I should say that assembly should be included in thrift, at least as difficult as newspapers and banquets. Association is also a similar thing. After the labor of association, the contribution will not exceed the amateur actors' use of "I am like" a few sentences of a certain society or a certain society.

I originally had some interest in freedom of speech. But recently, my interest has waned, and soon I will probably lose interest. Because I have already felt that if freedom of speech refers to just talking, I am already free enough. Every day, I don't know how many discussions I have with my family and friends, about the size of flies, the subtlety of the universe, speaking freely, and casually speaking, who will come to prohibit or interfere with me? The Hyde Park in London has speeches by various parties and factions, which the world regards as the foundation of British democracy. Thinking about it carefully, I really find it funny. The audience is not more numerous than my family and friends, and their intention is no different from our watching street performances. Moreover, in the final analysis, no matter how long the history of speeches in Hyde Park is, Britain is still only the Conservative Party and the Labour Party plus the Liberal Party this little braid. What contribution does it make to the country and the world? As for freedom of speech in writing, I think the fact is: if you want to freely publish your grand theories, you can start your own newspaper or magazine, otherwise this freedom is not for you. Because it is difficult for you to publish your great works advocating liberalism in newspapers and magazines that advocate illiberalism, and how can you publicize your great articles opposing liberalism in newspapers and magazines that advocate liberalism? It turns out that the freedom that a certain group or a certain newspaper righteously and vehemently strives for is the freedom of that group or that newspaper, and it has nothing to do with you who are not their own people. The examples of this are not uncommon throughout history, both at home and abroad. If you don't believe it, read history.

Therefore, I do not choose freedom, if I also have the freedom to choose what I love.

### Chinese Grammar

— Wen Jie

Chinese characters, saying that they have no grammar, it is not completely without it, saying that they have grammar, but you cannot say a system. This may be because it has not been studied in detail. However, recent people who talk about Chinese grammar mostly take English grammar as the standard and use it to restrain Chinese, which may not always be appropriate. It must be known that English has English grammar, French has French grammar, and German and Russian have German and Russian grammar. Those who speak of English grammar do not initially restrain English with the grammar of French, German, and Russian, and those who speak of French, German, and Russian grammar do not initially restrain French, German, and Russian with the grammar of other countries. Then why must one uniquely restrain Chinese grammar with the grammar of other countries?

I intend to speak of Chinese grammar, and I must take Chinese itself as the foundation, and then supplement it with the grammar of other languages as a reference, so that the correctness of Chinese grammar can be obtained. There are many sentence structures in Chinese, which, if measured by English grammar, may not meet the standard, but reading them is "smooth." For example, the phrase "yelling like killing a pig," according to English grammar, must be changed to "yelling like a pig being killed." Another example is the phrase "stick beats unfaithful man." According to a purely English grammar explanation, this stick must be able to fly automatically.

Extending this to philosophy, Hu Shi's "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy, Volume 1" takes American modern experimentalism as the standard and uses it to evaluate Chinese philosophy. Many scholars believe that this is looking at Chinese philosophy through colored glasses, criticizing it for failing to grasp the correctness of Chinese philosophy. Feng Youlan's "History of Chinese Philosophy" speaks of a certain philosopher's philosophy from the perspective of that philosopher, following the principle of "interpreting the classics with the classics." Chen Yinque commented on Feng's book, saying, "...those who are called understanding must roam in meditation and be in the same realm as the ancient people who established the theory, and express a kind of sympathy for the painstaking efforts of their arguments that had to be so, in order to criticize the merits and demerits of their theories, and without any obstacles or superficial discussions. Otherwise, the old sayings of thousands of years ago are very different from today's situation, what can not be laughed at and regarded as strange?" He also said: "...today, those who talk about ancient Chinese philosophy mostly talk about their own philosophy today; the history of Chinese philosophy they write is their own philosophy history today. The more organized and systematic their arguments are, the farther they deviate from the truth of the ancient people's theories..."

Extending this to economics, if one does not take the current economic situation as the object and uses several old "methods" as the reality, then the more one talks about economics, the more impossible it is to have any solution. Extending this to politics, if one does not take the political situation as the object to govern, but only knows how to treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, the more chaotic the politics will naturally become.

### Notes in Sickness

— Ji Er

When the cold wave is coming but has not yet arrived, I, who am running around in the wind, have caught a cold. My cough is intermittent, and my mood is also very uneasy. I am indeed somewhat sick in both body and mind.

I am lying in bed sick during the New Year. In the blink of an eye, the price of rice has broken through the 1.5 million yuan mark. The red market is rising, and prices of everything are soaring. The newspapers are full of dazzling triangles. But today, when colleagues meet, everyone laughs and takes it for granted. This indifferent mood is quite sad. However, things always have two sides. The day before yesterday, someone from my hometown came and talked about the lives of the farmers in my hometown this year, and I was very happy. It is said that the market in the countryside is particularly good this year, and the department stores are full of farmers. It turns out that last year, it took more than one load of rice to exchange for one pound of wool, but this year, one load of rice can be exchanged for more than two pounds of wool. He excitedly said, "This is a big difference." I then suddenly realized the meaning of the saying "killing the cheap hurts the farmers."

The above does not mean to support price increases, but only to point out how different people's hopes are. Originally, adults have adults' hopes, and children have children's hopes; capitalists have capitalists' hopes, and workers have workers' hopes; merchants have merchants' hopes, and farmers have farmers' hopes... How can everything be as one wishes?

People who have lived in the city for a long time may not easily understand the lives of the people in various places that the city relies on as a "distribution center." All the people they come into contact with from various places seem to be "refugees." In fact, there are many people who live and work in peace and contentment on this vast land! For example, my hometown is in the triangle between the Jinghu and Huhang railways, the so-called land of fish and rice. Thousands upon thousands of people are farmers. As long as there are fish to catch and rice to harvest, they can live and work in peace and contentment. This year, they have not been destroyed by artillery fire, so they have recovered a little of the previous hustle and bustle, and they are still happy.

On the other hand, what about me, this poor civil servant? I see that all public utilities have begun to apply the formula of "automatic adjustment" - and the adjustment of treatment that I am looking forward to still requires three months at a time. I don't have much hope while I am sick, but I hope that everything will have an "automatic adjustment" formula that can be applied in the future, so that I can be at peace in both body and mind.

### Leisurely Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 6 Misfortunes Never Come Singly (41)

Zhu Zhai saw that she kept saying she was waiting, and there were many sufferings in her heart that she could not express, so she just reluctantly agreed. After Qi Wan said this, she did not mention it again. Then she told Zhu Zhai about what had happened during the street performance in Jinan Road, and said that after the street performance in Jinan, she would have to go to Qingdao for another street performance. She herself was unwilling to go, but in order to plan for future living expenses, she had to go. She said: "I hope that after the performances in Jinan and Qingdao, the remaining money can be used to buy a slightly decent house, and the remaining money can be used for living expenses, so that I can live a peaceful life." Zhu Zhai saw that she was in high spirits and that everything she said was optimistic, so he did not say anything more. That day, the two of them only talked for two hours. He Zhou had already sent people to urge her several times. Qi Wan had many household affairs to discuss with He Zhou, so she could not delay any longer. When she left, she only told Zhu Zhai: "I will always remember what you said that night. I am waiting for you. I think that when I come back this time, our affairs will have already been resolved." As she said this, she shook Zhu Zhai's hand several times and left. When Zhu Zhai returned home, he felt that this matter was very difficult to handle. Qi Wan's friendship with him had evolved to this point. It was impossible not to divorce his wife. However, everyone in his family, starting with his father, would definitely not agree with this divorce issue. Once it was mentioned, they would definitely all object. To handle this matter, he had to get Feng Sheng to take the initiative to file for divorce. Feng Sheng was also the most stubborn woman. If she had not been greatly stimulated, she would never have such an action. He was the most indecisive person, with the softest ears, and loved to listen to gossip. Someone had to provoke her from the inside in order to brew a marital change. Now, who should he use? That was another problem. After thinking for a long time, he thought of Zhang Yunqing. The fact that he had married Feng Sheng this time was the most painful thing for Yunqing. She had privately expressed to others that she would never marry for the rest of her life. Her deep affection was the most touching. If he told her at this time that he wanted to divorce Feng Sheng, she would definitely agree. It would be better to use her to provoke Feng Sheng in front of Feng Sheng and get her to take the initiative to file for divorce. After the marriage contract was dissolved, he would then propose some conditions and discuss them with Qi Wan to see if she could accept them. If she could not accept them, he would then marry Yunqing. In this way, he would be worthy of Qi Wan and also worthy of Yunqing. However, although Feng Sheng was not clear-headed, she had not made any mistakes after marrying him. Once he abandoned her, his conscience would be very uneasy. He had to give her better conditions so that she could live a stable life in the future. Zhu Zhai was torn between reason and desire over this matter. He thought about it all night. The next day, he could not help but run to Zhang Yunqing's house. As soon as he entered the door, he sighed and sat on the sofa, just staring blankly. When Yunqing saw him like this, she thought that he had been bullied again outside. First, she sent a cup of tea over, sat next to him on the sofa, and very gently, in a low voice, asked: "Why are you unhappy again today?"

### Casual Notes from Liaozhai Studio

— Hun Jia

One only has compassion when one has the possibility of falling into a pitiable state.

People should not judge each other, but only talk to each other—human souls have no one and no problem.

Grand songs or military music can indeed arouse our enthusiasm for generous dedication, but they can also arouse the same emotions in the enemy; the enemy's grand songs or military music can arouse the enemy's enthusiasm for generous dedication, but they can also arouse the same emotions in our hearts. Although the composer has a special purpose in mind when composing, the music itself is after all beyond national boundaries.

The way to relieve sorrow and boredom is better the less one has to rely on the cooperation of opponents, the more one can do as one pleases, and therefore the better. Mahjong is not as good as pai gow and playing cards, because pai gow and playing cards are not limited to four people. Playing any card game is not as good as playing an instrument or composing poetry or drinking wine. If entertainment still depends on external things, one will never be completely free.

### Zhang Jun and Zhang Jun

— Zheng Guoyi

I mentioned Qin Hui and the Zhang Wang clan in this newspaper before, referring to Zhang Jun, but the character "Jun" was mistakenly printed as "Jun" (浚). This inadvertently caused Zhang Deyuan (浚), Duke Wei, loyal and dedicated to defending the nation, to suffer in place of Zhang Jun, who has been kneeling before the tomb of Yue Fei for so long. Therefore, I must say a word to clarify this.

According to historical records, although later generations of Song people highly revered Zhang Jun, even to the extreme (Zhu Xi wrote an inscription for Duke Wei's shrine stele, exceeding ten thousand words, and the "History of the Song Dynasty" even compared him to Zhuge Liang, stating that he resolutely opposed peace talks and his determination to avenge the country never wavered, living up to Zhuge Liang's saying of "dedicating his all until his dying day"), some later generations criticized him for his repeated defeats at Fuli and Fuping, resulting in countless losses. Some even blamed him for recommending Qin Hui, leading to a treacherous minister holding power, yielding to peace talks, and preventing the Southern Song Dynasty from ever recovering, tracing the beginning of the disaster to Duke Wei. Upon reviewing certain publications, I found that some people strongly defended Zhang Jun against these accusations, arguing that Duke Wei's integrity would not allow such actions, attributing it to a lack of historical knowledge. Zhang Jun swore to avenge the national enemy and refused to coexist with the Jin people, and he was undoubtedly a loyal minister of his time. Although his aspirations were not fulfilled, it is not right to immediately condemn him. However, to say that he never recommended Qin Hui is to ignore the clear historical records. The "Essential Records Since the Jianyan Era" states: "An edict ordered Qin Hui, the garrison commander of the temporary palace, to report to the imperial court. Zhang Jun believed that Hui had suggested establishing the Zhao clan during the Jingkang Incident, was not afraid of death, possessed ability, and could be entrusted with national affairs. At the time, many virtuous officials strongly recommended Hui, leading to his promotion." Additionally, the "Linquan Yelu" states: "When Hui was serving in Wenzhou, he was unremarkable and achieved nothing. When Zhang Jun became prime minister, the emperor visited Pingjiang to pacify the army. Jun believed that Hui was pliable and easily controlled, so he recommended him to fill a position in the imperial court, resulting in his appointment as the garrison commander of the temporary palace." The "Essential Records Since the Jianyan Era" states that Zhang Jun recommended Qin Hui because he "was not afraid of death, possessed ability, and could be entrusted with national affairs," while the "Linquan Yelu" states that Jun brought him into the government because he believed that Hui was "pliable and easily controlled." Although the two accounts differ, the fact remains that Jun recommended Qin Hui. However, the "Linquan Yelu"'s account is likely speculation, as Duke Wei would never have done such a thing. Moreover, when Qin Hui escaped from the Jin and returned, the court was shocked by his loyalty and righteousness, and many people recommended him, not just Zhang Jun alone. Even Zhao Ding, a virtuous man, regretted his decision to "work closely with him, only to realize his ignorance." The subsequent actions of Qin Hui were beyond anyone's expectations. Therefore, blaming Zhang Jun for harming the nation out of selfish motives is unfair, and Zhang Jun cannot accept such blame. If we were to judge people in such a roundabout way, then Cai Jing's governance, which led to the Jingkang disaster, could also be attributed to Wen Gong's selfish motives, as Cai Jing entered the government because Sima Guang admired his ability to implement the New Policies and introduced him. Furthermore, Zhang Jun's removal of Li Gang is often criticized, so Zhu Shengfei's "Xiushui Xianju Lu" extensively discussed their subsequent reconciliation and friendship, using harsh language to criticize Zhang Jun, which damaged his reputation. However, the "Essential Records Since the Jianyan Era" states: "Jun and Gang were initially incompatible, but later became friends, due to national affairs. Shengfei directly criticized them as an exchange of power, which is likely untrue." This is a fair assessment. In summary, Zhang Jun's merits and demerits balance each other out. Although he repeatedly suffered defeats and never won against the enemy, Wu Jie defended Sichuan, firmly resisting the Jin soldiers and not losing an inch of land. This was initially due to Zhang Jun's appointment and promotion of him. Ultimately, Western Shu relied on Jie for its defense, and Jun's contribution was significant. How can we solely blame Zhang Jun for the defeat at Fuping and ignore his contribution to defending Sichuan? As for his unwavering opposition to peace talks, the Song Dynasty depended on it for its safety. The country was weakening, and this one person was indispensable. The most that people can criticize him for is "great ambition but limited talent," which does not diminish Duke Wei's reputation. I have always believed that the Southern Song Dynasty was able to establish itself thanks to Zong Ze in the early stages and Zhang Jun later on. However, due to the similar appearance of the characters "Jun" (浚) and "Jun" (俊), they are often mistaken for the same person, which is Duke Wei's misfortune.

### The Harm of Skipping Breakfast

— Tuo

In a Michigan arms factory, there were a continuous series of 1,000 fainting spells and various unfortunate incidents in 1945 alone. The majority of these fainting spells occurred between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM. These problems would occur for workers who had not eaten breakfast or had eaten very little.

During the morning hours, if one is constantly threatened by hunger, it can lead to nervous disorders, reduced judgment, and physical fatigue. The occurrence of these 1,000 unfortunate incidents was due to everyone skipping breakfast.

To express our support, this newspaper has accepted the committee's entrustment to sell these raffle tickets on their behalf. Sales have been briskly conducted at the business department of this newspaper. The tickets are available in two denominations: 100,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan. Those who come to the newspaper to purchase tickets are very enthusiastic, and supporting this cause is truly a way to benefit both oneself and others.

### Reader's Mailbox

To Qimei Junjian: There is currently no Esperanto organization in Shanghai after the war. At present, the only way is to study on your own. You can purchase the "Complete Esperanto Course" or "Introduction to Esperanto" published by Kaiming Bookstore as a self-study tool. When learning literature, if it is for appreciation purposes, the main method is to read more world classics and gradually improve your appreciation ability. If the purpose is to learn to write, in addition to the above method, you should practice writing more. If you can approach famous writers and ask them for guidance at any time, your progress will definitely be faster.

To Hanmosheng Junjian: The previous letter was forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau for verification. The reply received stated: "After dispatching personnel to investigate, the situation was not as serious as described in the original letter. In addition to immediately ordering its removal and issuing a warning, the sanitation worker of the lane was also instructed to regularly maintain cleanliness.
