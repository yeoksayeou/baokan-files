### The National Assembly Holds Another Vote: No Vice President Yet, Third Election Meeting This Morning

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The National Assembly held its second vice-presidential election meeting at 9:30 AM on the 24th. Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian, the top three candidates from the first meeting's voting results, proceeded to the second round of voting. The outcome was that none of them secured the required majority, resulting in the failure to elect a vice president. In accordance with the law, Li, Sun, and Cheng will be subjected to a third election. Zhang Xiwen presided over today's meeting, with 2,765 representatives in attendance. After announcing the start of the meeting, the Secretary-General first reported the names of the vote-counting supervisors determined by the presidium through a lottery. He then restated the order of today's vote before promptly instructing the supervisors to assume their respective posts. The distribution of ballots, writing of ballots, and voting commenced swiftly at 10:05 AM. The entire voting process concluded rapidly, taking only until 10:50 AM. Subsequently, after the Chairman and supervisors completed their final votes, the process still did not exceed 11:00 AM. The event proceeded smoothly, with only minor unrest occurring when some representatives on the upper level expressed dissatisfaction that a certain individual, not a National Assembly representative but a candidate, was seated in an official seat. However, the situation quickly subsided. Following the collection of the twelve ballot boxes at the presiding platform, the session was reconvened at 11:08 AM. The Secretary-General explained the vote-counting procedure, and the actual count commenced at 11:30 AM, concluding at 1:00 PM. Of the 2,765 representatives present, 2,760 cast ballots. Thirty-six ballots were invalid, leaving 2,724 valid ballots. Li Zongren received the most votes, totaling 1,163. Sun Ke came in second with 945 votes, and Cheng Qian received the fewest with 616. The meeting adjourned around 1:00 PM, with the afternoon session recessed.

The ballots for the third election have been rushed into production by the secretariat and are already printed. The format remains the same, but the background is white with green text, listing the names of Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian. The presidium appointed representatives Mei Youzhuo, Li Shizhen, and Chen Shirui that evening to stamp the meeting seal and affix personal seals and signatures for safekeeping, to be unsealed in public at the meeting on the morning of the 25th. The presidium also appointed Feng Youzhen, Ma Hongkui, and Ye Xiufeng as vote-taking and counting supervisors through a lottery selection by the representatives, totaling one hundred and ten people.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] It has been decided that the certificates of election for the President and Vice President will be presented in the assembly hall after the Vice President is elected. This will be the last item on the agenda before the closing of the National Assembly. There had been a proposal to send them to the National Government, but this has been abandoned. It is reported that the presidium has tentatively nominated Yu Youren to represent the Assembly in presenting the President's election certificate. The format of the election certificate was discussed extensively at the presidium meeting on the evening of the 24th, but no decision was reached. The matter has been referred to the secretariat for preliminary design before being submitted to the presidium meeting for decision.

### Truman and Marshall Congratulate Chairman Chiang on His Election as President; Ambassador Expresses Satisfaction and Hopes the Aid to China Act Will Be Effective

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] US President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Ambassador Stuart recently sent congratulatory messages to Chairman Chiang upon his election as the first President of the Republic of China. The respective letters and telegrams are as follows:

[Truman's Congratulatory Telegram] To Chairman Chiang: I have been directed by the President of the United States to convey the following congratulatory message: "I am pleased to learn of Your Excellency's election as the first constitutional President. I, along with the American people, extend our sincere congratulations." I, too, offer my congratulations. Our two countries have enjoyed a long-standing friendship, and the American people are deeply concerned about China's progress on the path to modern democracy. China has suffered greatly during eight years of war, and has yet to recover from those wounds, now facing internal strife, the gravity of which would be insurmountable by other nations lacking such resilience. Your Excellency's assumption of the presidency coincides with the passage of the Foreign Assistance Act by the United States Congress, which is gratifying. I hope that the implementation of this act will alleviate the heavy burden on the Chinese people. I believe Your Excellency shares this sentiment. I wish you and the Chinese people success. Sincerely, Stuart.

[Marshall's Congratulatory Telegram] I am delighted to hear of Your Excellency's election as the first President of China's constitutional government. I wish you continued success in leading China. Sincerely, Marshall.

They also went to the office at 4:30 PM on the 24th to register. The registration office staff stated that they could not register them because they did not have certificates of election. Zhang and the others forcibly took the registration book and signed it individually, but they were unable to obtain registration certificates. Xu Yun, the person in charge of the registration office, stated that this dispute was unresolvable and would be reported to Secretary-General Lou Tongsun for instructions. The 25th is a Sunday holiday, and registration will be suspended for one day. Registration will resume on the 26th.

By midnight, nearly a thousand had been killed or wounded. On the morning of the 24th, they switched to a stealth attack, using demolition teams to dig tunnels in an attempt to destroy the southwestern city wall. They were annihilated by the defending troops in counter-trench warfare. Yan Xishan stated that the bandits' attack on Ying County was intended to open a passage between the Jin-Ji and Tong-Sui lines. The bandit offensive against Linfen has weakened, and the bandits are gradually moving north to block the National Army advancing south. He praised Liang Peihuang, the defending general, for his determination and initiative. Deng Wenyi also sent a telegram to Liang to express his respect.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th] The defense of Ying County reached its climax. The Communist bandits, inhumanely, even used smoke and poison gas shells, which are prohibited by national defense regulations. The bandit army, with forces several times larger than the defending garrison, launched relentless attacks but failed to achieve success. Starting at 5:00 PM on the 22nd, they launched a general offensive again, swarming forward under the cover of intense artillery fire and smoke and poison gas. They employed a revolving door tactic, launching over thirty waves of attacks and firing over a thousand artillery shells. Several sections of the city walls on the southeast and southwest corners were destroyed by the bandits' fire. At 10:00 PM, the bandits released poison gas smoke shells at the breaches on the southeast and southwest corners of the city wall and erected ladders, forcibly scaling the outer walls. The defending troops fought bravely, engaging the bandits in unprecedented close-quarters combat. At midnight, they finally repelled the main force of the attacking bandits on all fronts. The bandits also suffered heavy casualties, and their offensive was thwarted. By dawn on the 23rd, the bandits were only mounting small-scale harassing attacks, and the situation gradually calmed down. It is estimated that over three thousand bandit troops were killed or wounded in this battle. Upon receiving the news of the victory, Director Yan sent a special telegram to commend Commander Zhang Pu and all the officers and soldiers.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th] When the National Army in Linfen launched an attack towards the south of the city on the 22nd, they captured the bandits' first-line positions, killing or wounding over 200 bandits, including the company commander. They also seized over 50 pieces of engineering equipment.

### Guan Linzheng Discusses the Current Situation in the Northeast

Communist Bandits Entering Shanhaiguan is Still Not Possible

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Guan Linzheng, after inspecting the Northeast, stated: There may be a major war in the Northeast in May. The Communist bandits may target Shenyang. It is currently not possible for the Communist bandits in the Northeast to enter Shanhaiguan. He stated: Since Wei Lihuang arrived in the Northeast, morale has greatly improved, and there are no major problems in maintaining the current situation. However, the environment in the Northeast is too difficult, and more strength is needed to develop it. Guan also emphasized that the Northeast is the lifeline of the nation. The Northeast is rich in both coal and iron, which are necessary for an agricultural country to move towards industrialization. A country without an independent industry cannot have an independent defense. Guan inspected the Second Officer Training Corps on the 24th and will soon fly to Taiwan, Xi'an, and Dihua for inspections.

Views on the Situation in Shaanxi

Guan also stated: The current situation in Shaanxi is indeed as serious as that in the Northeast, but the causes are complex and cannot be attributed to General Hu Zongnan alone. General Hu has outstanding military talent, and I believe he will be able to maintain the situation in Shaanxi. Guan cautiously answered reporters' questions, saying: The serious situation in Shaanxi is due to troop strength and troop movements. He pointed out that to break the situation in Shaanxi, new forces should be added. He believes that the nature of total war requires political cooperation with the military and strengthening local forces. He believes that under the current situation, the coordination of the Jin-Shaanxi war situation cannot be discussed.

### National Assembly Proceedings: Vice Presidential Election - Runoff

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The vice presidential election battle has entered the runoff stage. Today's session of the National Assembly seemed even more heated than yesterday. Although the number of candidates had been reduced from six to three, the intense competition was clearly reflected in every corner of the venue today. To avoid provocative propaganda, the presidium specifically stipulated that leaflets were not allowed to be distributed inside the venue today. However, outside the hall, newspapers, leaflets, and various promotional materials were still flying everywhere. Sun Ke's promotional "train" emitted calls to "elect Sun Ke as Vice President" outside the assembly hall. People wearing badges identifying them as special guests or government officials were seen in twos and threes, maneuvering among the representatives, occasionally whispering.

Li Zongren, riding on the momentum of yesterday's victory, arrived at the venue early with a smile that conveyed both triumph and tension, accompanied by his wife, Guo Dejie. Wearing his government official badge, he stood in front of the assembly hall at 9:00 AM, just as he did yesterday, shaking hands with the representatives one by one. Guo Dejie stood inside the door, and almost no representative escaped her gaze. She immediately followed up with enthusiastic handshakes. Today, she seemed even happier and more optimistic than before. "Please help! Help! Help!" her voice continuously rang out. When she met familiar representatives, she affectionately patted their shoulders, repeatedly saying, "A wink is as good as a nod! A wink is as good as a nod! A wink is as good as a nod!" One representative, as if reporting a successful mission, said to her, "I voted for Mr. Li yesterday, and I'll vote for Mr. Li today." She immediately replied, "There are still two rounds to go. Please continue to help!" When Weng Wenhao entered the venue, she also grabbed him and asked, "Who will your conscience vote for?" Weng smiled and replied, "I'll vote for my conscience."

Help from the Supportive Wife in Campaigning

Sun Yat-sen's wife, Madam Chen Shuying, also stood inside the hall, closely beside Ma Chaojun's wife, Shen Huilian. Both greeted the representatives warmly with beaming smiles. Although Madam Sun was usually not as active and eloquent as Madam Li, she appeared particularly likable today. She and Madam Ma stood in front of Madam Li, and every representative first shook hands with them before approaching Madam Li. Madam Ma jokingly said, "I'm here to invite guests. I want to invite my good friends to visit Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum and Xuanwu Lake."

Cheng Qian did not have supportive wives like Li Zongren and Sun Ke canvassing for votes at the entrance. Nevertheless, he sincerely and enthusiastically interacted with the representatives inside the venue. He was still wearing that old black suit. Due to his sincerity and honest charm, he surprisingly secured third place yesterday. Today, he continued to exert his best efforts.

The atmosphere inside the venue was tense. However, the voting process had been improved through one or two revisions, and today's situation was better than yesterday's. The meticulous arrangements made by the General Secretariat of the Assembly in advance reduced the voting time by fifteen minutes compared to yesterday, and the vote counting was almost an hour faster than yesterday. By 1:10 PM, the results of the runoff were already presented to the representatives.

Yu, Mo, and Xu Display Democratic Spirit

There was a particularly touching scene amidst the tension during the voting. Yu Youren, Xu Fulin, and Mo Dehui, the three candidates who were eliminated in yesterday's preliminary round, all attended today's session to cast their sacred vote. Although today's three candidates were their opponents yesterday, after the preliminary round, Mr. Yu, Mr. Mo, and Mr. Xu all respected the voters' choice and cast their votes for their former campaign rivals. When Yu Youren and the others deposited their ballots into the ballot box, the representatives expressed their respect for their democratic spirit with enthusiastic applause, and the photographers rushed to capture the valuable moment.

During the one hour and forty minutes of vote counting, the venue was constantly shrouded in a tense atmosphere. Wave after wave of applause evoked various expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness from the representatives. The vote counters' voices reverberated in the hearts of the two thousand-plus representatives, and everyone felt the heavy pressure in the air. When the runoff results were announced, Li Zongren once again overwhelmingly defeated Sun and Cheng with 1,163 votes, taking the lead. However, they will have to face off one more time tomorrow to eliminate one more person or directly elect the vice president. The vote count from the twelve ballot boxes also presented a tense sequence during today's vote counting process. Li Zongren took the lead in the first ballot box with 94 votes, and Li continued to be in the lead until the fifth ballot box. In the total of the five ballot boxes, the ratio of Li, Sun, and Cheng was 463 to 370 to 321, which was not a significant difference. In the sixth ballot box, Sun Ke exceeded Li Zongren by a majority of 190 votes compared to Li's 121 votes. However, Li's total was 584 votes, still exceeding Sun Ke's total of 560 votes, maintaining the lead. At this point, Cheng Qian was more than 150 votes behind Li and Sun. Cheng, Li, and Sun were neck and neck in the seventh ballot box. In the eighth ballot box, Sun Ke and Li Zongren had a ratio of 99 to 39, and Sun achieved the overall lead for the first time. However, in the ninth ballot box immediately following, Li quickly caught up, regaining the lead with a majority of 123 votes. In the tenth ballot box, Li's momentum increased, achieving a record of 974 with an absolute majority of 170. At this point, Sun only had 842 votes. Cheng Qian's decline had already started from the seventh ballot box, and by this point, it was irreversible. He only had 526 votes at this time. After all the ballots were counted, Li took the lead with 1,163, while Sun only had 945, and Cheng only had 616. Today was only the result of the runoff. The final outcome remains to be seen tomorrow or the day after. (April 24, Nanjing)

### Weekly Forum: Science and Life

— Chen Anren

The scientific view of life and the relationship between science and life have different meanings. The former is the concept of life as expressed scientifically, while the latter explains the relationship between science and life. The former is the ideal of life as explained by science, while the latter indicates its direction from the perspective of science's influence on the achievements of life. The focus of the two aspects is different, but they are still interconnected. Please elaborate on the interconnected aspects as follows:

(A) Science Eliminates Obstacles and Suffering in Life In primitive times, human psychology was immature, and people often experienced surprise and terror towards the things of the universe and nature. They used superstition and fear of gods to replace all understanding of things. In this era, it was not easy for their thoughts and actions to embark on the path of science. Those who were slightly more evolved tried to eliminate various obstacles and sufferings in the natural and human world. For example, the "Bushmen" and the "pygmies" in Central Africa could make poison arrows for self-defense, the Iroquois could build bark houses, the Eskimos could build snow houses, and the British Columbians could build underground houses, all to reduce the suffering of natural cold. Various means of transportation were also gradually invented at this time, such as the cowhide boats of the American Indians, the large canoes of the Northwest, the sealskin boats of the Eskimos, and the assembled bark boats of Australia. In general, the more advanced human knowledge, the more people use scientific common sense to overcome the suffering and obstacles of the natural world. For example, humans could not freely travel in the sky, but with the advancement of aeronautics, airplanes and airships were successively invented, and they could travel freely in the clouds. Furthermore, humans could not survive in the suffocating atmosphere of the seabed, but with the invention of submarines, they could emerge and stay in the vast ocean. Life comes with sorrow and worry. Although there is still no way to eradicate suffering, it is not difficult to relatively reduce it. The most important things in life are sickness and death. These diseases and deaths are indeed unavoidable, but with the progress of science and medicine, the pain of illness is gradually reduced, and the lifespan of human beings is gradually extended. Modern scientists can inject camphor when the heart stops beating to prevent the collapse of the organism. Winterstein used a solution containing adrenaline salts to stimulate the heart of an animal that had been killed for three hours, and it was actually revived. It can be seen that the recovery and extension of life can gradually become a reality with the progress of science.

(B) Science Enhances Human Happiness and Well-being The more advanced science is, the more human happiness and well-being are enhanced. This can be explained in many ways. For example, various facilities for clothing, food, housing, and transportation are becoming more and more complete with the development of science, and human lifespan is increasing daily due to the enjoyment of comfort. Taking Europeans and Americans as an example, the average lifespan in the United States in 1920 was 53 years, and it increased by five years to 58 years in 1926. According to the calculations of the Berlin Federal Bureau of Statistics, the average lifespan of Germans in 1750 was 40 years, and it was 50 years in 1910, and it increased to 60 years in 1920. This is obviously the effect of the progress of medicine and the enjoyment of comfort, this is one aspect. Many people think that science can only give human beings material happiness, and may not be able to give human beings spiritual happiness, this is also not true. Because material happiness can often increase to spiritual pleasure. For example, it takes about 30 days to walk from Guilin to Chongqing, but it only takes three hours by plane. This is the second aspect. In Will Durant's letter to pessimists, he said: "Your generation has experienced the great wars of the past. This great war has changed you in every way. You have seen more than a hundred kinds of killing weapons invented one after another, and you have seen many international massacres coming one after another; although countries use diplomatic documents to solve difficulties on the surface, their essence is the unrestrained expression of imperial aggression and commercial competition. You have witnessed this situation, of course, you cannot believe in any form of utopia." However, science can create killing weapons, but it can also create weapons that benefit people. If justice is upheld and the world is unified, the various tragedies mentioned above can be avoided. How can the gifts of science to mankind be limited?

(C) Science Expresses the Value of Human Life Philosophy, religion, ethics, morality, and science are not incompatible with each other, but mutually beneficial. Many people think that the spiritual value of life should be sought in the cultivation of philosophy, religion, morality, and ethics, and cannot be sought in science, which is not entirely true. Buddha, Christ, and Confucius, with the same grand ambition of saving the world, establishing oneself and helping others establish themselves, and achieving oneself and helping others achieve themselves, established models for future generations with religion, ethics, and morality. Their spirit should be immortal. As for scientists' devotion to science, in addition to benefiting mankind and providing for the masses, their lofty personality and excellent academic achievements can often inspire people's ambition and overcome stubbornness.

(D) Science Guides the Future of Life Science includes two aspects, namely method and spirit. The scientific method seeks knowledge, and the scientific spirit seeks faith. Knowledge is the foundation of action, and action is the use of knowledge. Ignorance is not enough to speak of action, so seeking knowledge is to help action, and seeking faith is to seek truth. Truth is the foundation of faith, and untruth is dishonesty. Because science is not metaphysics, it seeks knowledge, action, reality, and faith in everything. The future of life can only be built on the foundation of knowledge, action, honesty, and faith, and then it will be unshakable and able to stand on its own. When Darwin was at Cambridge University, the longer he stayed, the more his interest in exploring natural science grew. After returning from an inspection in North Venice in 1831, with an interest in studying geology, he decided to sail to South America to measure the terrain. He spent six years on the Royal Navy ship Beagle, and had in-depth research in various aspects such as zoology, botany, and geology. The great achievements he later established in science and philosophy were based on this time. This is one example of science guiding life.

In short, science establishes the highest ideals of the world and mankind, and in detail, it also establishes the highest ideals of life. Because its purpose is to establish a world of truth, goodness, and beauty, it must cooperate with religion, philosophy, ethics, morality, and other disciplines to first establish a life of truth, goodness, and beauty. The highest ideals of mankind are the promotion of world humanitarianism, the realization of the idea of world unity, the organization of a world permanent peace mechanism, and the promotion of the spirit of universal love of mankind. The paths are the unification of world culture, the promotion of technology, the communication of academics, the connection of thoughts, the consistency of writing, the integration of religions, the equalization of education, and the exchange of materials. These works all rely on the development of science. Only when totalitarianism, imperialism, aggressionism, militarism, warlordism, and feudalism are completely eliminated, science will benefit the world without harm and make great contributions. Locke said in his 1889 speech: "Now is a period of rapid advancement in natural science. A series of small waves discovered a few months or weeks ago are now combined into a very large wave. On this wave crest, we can see a future great all-encompassing theory." It is only because the rationalism before the 20th century was mixed with all kinds of base thoughts, which caused the great disaster of the world. After painful reflection, this era should be over. In the second half of this era, if everyone is willing to step into the new era of human revival with a new look, they still have to rely on science. Science is ultimately the tool for the highest ideals of the world and mankind.

### Purkitt to Assume Role as Executor of Aid to China Program US Economic Adjustment Agency to Establish Special Division for Aid to China Pei Tsu-yi Departs from Washington to Return Home

[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Economic Adjustment Agency Director Hoffman announced today: "The Economic Adjustment Agency will establish a special division to handle the $463 million aid to China program. I have internally designated several candidates for the director of the division, but have not yet made a final decision."

[United Press International, This City News] According to well-informed sources, former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union William Averell Harriman may assume the role of executor of the aid to China program and will arrive in Shanghai on May 3. According to Harriman's articles and speeches, he has had a significant influence on China's acquisition of US aid. Although well-informed American sources here have confirmed that Harriman will leave the United States by Pan American plane at the end of the month and arrive in Shanghai on May 3, they know nothing about Harriman's possible position in China. However, senior Chinese officials said that they "deeply know" that Harriman has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the executor of the aid to China program.

In fact, we can provide more effective assistance to China in other ways. We should immediately provide the National Government with military training officers and advisors, as advocated by Wedemeyer and Chennault."

### Cheating Discovered in Changzhou's Grain Inspection - Tax Grain Sold Off, High-Quality Rice Switched to Inferior Rice

[Our Wujin Report, 23rd] Corruption and malpractice in this county's Tax Grain Office's collection of land tax for the 36th year of the Republic have been rampant, causing much public outcry. After strict questioning by the Third County Council, a separate investigation committee was formed to conduct an on-site investigation. The first investigation team has now discovered that the office, led by Secretary Lu, transported 4,468 piculs of tax grain from the Xueyanqiao warehouse in the old and new villages of Yingchun to Wuxi to be processed into white japonica rice. 930 bags have already been shipped. This tax grain was arranged by Lu to be transferred through Zhenxing Xie, a contracted rice mill in this county. The factory's resident staff member, Xie, strongly refused, and the matter was exposed. Lu is currently trying to make amends, but the investigation committee has confirmed the evidence and cannot hide it. In addition, Shou Xuefan, an officer dispatched by the Caoqiao Office, escorted tax grain from the countryside to the city in batches, delivering a total of over 1,400 piculs to the Jinfeng Rice Mill. All of it was japonica rice in the countryside, but it all turned into indica rice at the mill. The price difference between high-quality japonica and low-quality indica rice is 100,000 yuan per picul, and the amount of embezzlement is as high as 200 million yuan. The first investigation team has filed charges for the above two cases, and the remaining investigations are continuing.

### 20,000 Feet High, Seven Hours of Flight - Exploring Mount Jishi

— Our Special Correspondent Hong Xucai

[Our Hong Kong Air Report, 23rd] Is it possible that Mount Jishi could surpass Mount Everest and become the world's highest peak? This mystery gradually gained momentum after Renault's ballpoint pens were smuggled into the country. As the legend of Mount Jishi became more and more widespread, the sales of Renault's ballpoint pens also increased. Just as people were developing a strong interest in the mystery of Mount Jishi, Renault quietly slipped away, leaving behind an indelible shame!

Chen Wenkuan, the deputy director of China National Aviation Corporation, said that he had flown over Mount Jishi several times, and based on his experience, he believed that its height could not exceed Mount Everest. To confirm this, he specially allocated a special plane to invite Shanghai news reporters to conduct an on-site survey.

The special plane took off from Shanghai on the 15th of this month. Accompanying were 18 Chinese and foreign reporters. Along the way, it landed in Hankou and Xi'an to refuel. That night, it arrived directly in Lanzhou. The CNAC hosted us at the Northwest Building, which is the best hotel in the area. At 4:30 the next morning, a group bus took us to the airport. Along the way, we enjoyed the scenery of the Northwest in the dim morning light, with yellow sand, red walls, ox carts, and sheep herds.

The special plane was already prepared, but just as I was about to board, the co-pilot Zheng Shijie unexpectedly stopped me. He smiled and told me that I had to take a "crash course in parachuting" before I was qualified to fly at high altitude. My heart jumped. I saw the workers carrying parachutes down from the plane. The thick dust accumulated on the parachutes told me that parachutes were not used lightly. I really did not expect that measuring Mount Jishi would harbor such a serious crisis.

Chen Wenkuan first tried on the parachute himself as a model, and then told everyone to learn how to wear it. As I was fumbling with the clumsy and heavy parachute, Chen Wenkuan came over. He helped me put on the parachute, pointed to the steel handle on my waist, and taught me methodically: "You must pull upwards with force within a few seconds after jumping out of the plane. The parachute will quickly open. Everyone will inevitably be unconscious for the first few seconds, but will quickly regain consciousness. At that time, you should take control yourself, look around, and don't let anyone collide with you. To go east, pull the rope on the east side. To go west, pull the rope on the west side. Avoid falling into the river and try to land on flat ground... Do you understand now?"

When I saw others carrying parachutes on their backs, practicing carefully, and writing their names on the parachutes, I deeply realized the seriousness of the situation. To be honest, I really wanted to escape at the last minute. But then I thought carefully about my fearless spirit before departure, as if I were a hero. If the result was that I ran away with my head in my hands, wouldn't that be a repeat of Renault's scandal? So, I decided to muster my courage and not let myself fall apart. The special plane flew from Lanzhou to the mountain range bordering Gansu and Qinghai. Looking down from the plane, all I could see were endless earthen mountains. The brown mountain ranges rose and fell one after another, endlessly. After flying for an hour, the view suddenly opened up. All I could see was ice and snow, dazzling in the silver light. This was our destination, Mount Jishi.

At this time, the plane gradually rose. When the altimeter pointed to 18,000 feet, everyone began to feel suffocated and uncomfortable. The oxygen equipment in the special plane had already been installed. The thing looked like a gas mask, covering the mouth and nose, and connecting to the oxygen tank. Because I had never used oxygen before, I always felt that the rubber mask was unreliable, and I was afraid that the oxygen would escape before it was inhaled. I pressed the rubber mask tightly against my nose, even rubbing my cheeks. .

When the plane gradually rose above 20,000 feet, I began to feel unsustainable, but I still did not want to take my eyes off the target. What unfolded before my eyes was just a vast expanse of white, endless. It really seemed like the world was Mount Jishi, or that we had entered another world. There, I couldn't see a single person or a single tree. There was no vegetation, no birds or animals. Besides the sky, there were mountains. The snow-capped peaks, one after another, seemed to never end. I don't know when the plane left that place, because when the plane rose to 21,000 feet, I felt dizzy and experienced an indescribable discomfort, which was definitely something I had never experienced in my life. I could no longer pretend to be a "tough guy." I had to lie down in the plane and couldn't move.

The weather was not ideal that day. The clouds were deep, and the wind was strong. When the plane soared into the sky, the turbulence was quite strong, and the taste was really unpleasant. I occasionally raised my head to look. Many faces were pale, and their lips were purple. Along with the sound of vomiting, I thought at that time that it was fortunate that I was not the only one lying down, otherwise it would inevitably give people the impression that "women are not good after all."

From these high-altitude flights, I felt that the physique of the Americans was better than mine. I saw that reporters from Life Magazine, the New York Times, and MGM were active on the plane from beginning to end, jumping around and taking shots. I hated the photographer from Life Magazine the most. He insisted on pointing the camera at my ugly appearance when I was unable to move. I understood that the reason he did this must be to use my half-dead situation to contrast his strength and awesomeness. The more I thought about it, the angrier I got, and I covered my head with my coat.

I don't know how long I slept in a daze. Anyway, when I woke up, the lights in the plane were already on. My companions told me that we were already flying on the way back. Chen Wenkuan had come out of the cockpit and told everyone with a map that he had flown all over the Mount Jishi area and constantly used radar to measure the height of the peaks, but no mountain was over 20,000 feet.

I looked out from the window. It was dark all around. I looked at my watch, and the hour hand was pointing at 7:40. Thinking that according to the budget, it was estimated that we could return in four or five hours, but now we had flown for nearly seven hours, and it was already dark, everyone couldn't help but get a little nervous. The colleague sitting next to me said softly to me: "Lanzhou has no night navigation equipment, and the airport is surrounded by mountains. If we land blindly, it would be too dangerous!"

After he said this, I really felt scared. And at this moment, the door of the cockpit, which had been open all the time, was suddenly closed by the telegraph operator. So the situation became even more critical. Everyone strapped themselves tightly to their seats with seat belts. Many people were also scrambling to sit in the seats connected to the aircraft door, as if the plane was about to crash and he could jump out of the door first.

The plane finally flew over Lanzhou. It circled several times at low altitude. The tension on the faces of the people in the plane at this time can be imagined. But the special plane finally landed safely on the runway. In addition to expressing our gratitude, everyone had to praise Chen Wenkuan's skillful piloting.

In this way, I flew over Mount Jishi. Just as Chen Wenkuan said afterwards: Flying at high altitude for seven hours is definitely not a trivial matter. Being able to receive this experience may be worth commemorating in my life.

### Marshall Rushes Back to Washington from Bogotá to Handle Major Diplomatic Issues - Addressing the Situation in the Holy Land Cannot Be Delayed

[Our Report] San Francisco Radio, 24th: Marshall told reporters after returning to Washington today that agreements have been reached on most of the fundamental issues at the Bogotá Conference. After returning to Washington, Marshall will immediately discuss important world issues with his advisors.

[Our Report] San Francisco Radio, 24th: Secretary of State Marshall flew back to the country from Bogotá yesterday and arrived in Washington at 9:00 AM this morning. It is said that this sudden return to Washington is due to "particularly important events" awaiting his handling.

[United Press Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Marshall will return to Washington today to handle official business. Although Marshall did not specify what this official business was, officials pointed out that at least four major policy issues await his decision upon his arrival. Marshall's return today is not to deal with any crisis, but to deal with problems accumulated since he left Washington on March 28. The most important are as follows: (1) The United Nations' enforcement of a truce between Jews and Arabs in Palestine, the establishment of a trusteeship government, and the possible dispatch of an international security force to the Holy Land. This matter may not be able to proceed in time to prevent the expansion of the war in Palestine after the United Kingdom ends its mandate on May 15. (2) The US government will decide how to provide military aid to the planned Western European alliance. President Truman hosted reporters on Thursday and announced that a statement on this major diplomatic policy development will be released soon. (3) The situation in Berlin remains precarious, and it remains the most disputed area in the relationship between Western countries and the Soviet Union. (4) The Soviet Union's possible reaction to the Italian Communist Party's election defeat.

[United Press Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, 24th] On his way back to Washington from Bogotá, Marshall secretly flew to the Albrook Air Force Base here and had a two-hour secret talk with Lieutenant General Crittenberger, commander of the Caribbean Defense Command, before leaving the area to continue flying to Washington. According to well-informed sources, Marshall's departure from Bogotá before the end of the Pan-American Conference does not indicate any serious new crisis in world affairs, but only that several important foreign policy decisions need Marshall's decision. Moreover, the main work of the conference has been completed, and Marshall also believes that there is no need to stay here for a long time. The Pan-American Conference is stepping up discussions on various major items and is expected to close in a week.

### To Implement the Trusteeship of Palestine, the US Invites Our Troops to Participate - The Security Council Establishes a Truce Committee to Supervise the Truce in the Holy Land

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 23rd, United Press] Chinese sources revealed that China is negotiating with the United States regarding the possible use of Chinese troops to implement the United Nations' trusteeship of Palestine. It is said that China has not yet rejected the United States' request. If China decides to provide troops for security in the Holy Land, it can only go together with troops from the United States and other countries. The negotiations between the United States and China are the same as those with other countries in the United Nations.

Senior Chinese sources said: They have not made China subject to any restrictions. They also revealed that the difficulty China felt regarding the United States' request was that it could not withdraw troops from the country in its anti-communist war. There is growing belief that Britain is preparing to unite with the United States to implement the trusteeship, but France will reject the United States' proposal. Open discussions on the Palestinian issue at the United Nations have stalled, and every important aspect of the issue is being dealt with in secret. The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has temporarily adjourned to allow representatives to study France's proposal, which suggests taking emergency steps to protect Jerusalem from the scourge of the Arab-Jewish war.

[United Press Washington, 23rd] According to informal but reliable sources on the 23rd, if the United Nations needs member states to help guard Palestine, the United States is most likely to provide a Marine Division, totaling 17,000 people, plus some naval vessels.

[United Press Lake Success, 23rd] British representative Jones spoke at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 23rd, avoiding directly answering the United States' request for Britain to send troops to implement the trusteeship of Palestine, but said that the United States' trusteeship plan should be "considered." The British spokesperson also admitted that negotiations between the United Kingdom and the United States are still ongoing, and the British cabinet is still discussing the final answer to the United States' request to send troops.

[United Press Lake Success, 24th] The United Nations Security Council passed a US proposal tonight to establish a committee to supervise the truce in Palestine, composed of representatives from three countries. The delegation will be composed of the US, French, and Belgian consuls in Jerusalem in order to begin work immediately. The resolution passed by a vote of eight to zero, with the Soviet Union, Colombia, and Ukraine abstaining. The Soviet Union and Ukraine attacked the United States for nothing more than trying to subvert the partition plan for Palestine. Soviet representative Gromyko said, "The United States is afraid that Palestine will not be chaotic. To succeed in seeking a truce, it is necessary to stop the tricks that are being carried out daily." But the Soviet Union did not exercise its veto power. Earlier, British representative Jones said in the Political Committee of the General Assembly that the conflict in the Holy Land had expanded into an open war, which, if not stopped, might endanger world peace. The United States should now abandon the final solution and allow the United Nations to concentrate its efforts on preventing the expansion of the war. US representative Austin then made a proposal in the Security Council.

### General Assembly Suspends Debate on the Palestine Issue

Discussion of French Proposals to Begin Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 23rd] The General Assembly agreed today to suspend the general debate on the Palestine issue and first consider the French proposal, which advocates emergency measures to protect the walls and residents of Jerusalem. Chairman Jiang Tingfu announced that the Political Committee of the General Assembly will consider the French proposal on the 26th and temporarily postpone the general debate on the Palestine issue altogether. US and Australian representatives had also put forward proposals before France, but now they all agree to give priority to the French proposal. In the draft proposal, France only proposes that the General Assembly instruct the Trusteeship Council (in consultation with the trustee country and the relevant parties) to study the issue of protecting Jerusalem and take appropriate measures. It is generally believed that what France is seeking is to organize an international volunteer police force to serve in Jerusalem under the control of the Trusteeship Council. This proposal is likely to be opposed by the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union has so far refused to participate in the Trusteeship Council. The Soviet representative has now notified the General Assembly that it will express its views on the French proposal at the meeting on the 26th.

### France Does Not Intend to Participate

[Reuters Paris, 23rd] Sources say that the French government is very reluctant to participate in the joint control of Palestine under the auspices of the United Nations.

### Britain Declares Again

[Reuters Lake Success, 23rd] Britain today reiterated to the United Nations its decision to hand over Palestine on May 15 and to completely withdraw British troops from the Holy Land on August 1, and asked what to do with the Holy Land after the British withdrawal? British Colonial Minister Jones, in his address to the Political Committee of the General Assembly today, reiterated his previous statement and emphasized the importance of a truce. He said: Less than a month remains before Britain withdraws from Palestine. Time is obviously very pressing, and some resolutions must be obtained. Palestine is now in a state of administrative and social disintegration. After the trustee country withdraws, there is a danger of falling into anarchy and suicidal struggle.

### Special Criminal Court; Investigation of Cases to Begin Tomorrow; Court Address Too Small; Detention Center Too Far

A reporter visited Xu Shixian, the chief prosecutor of the court yesterday, and talked about the start of the court's work.

Because there are more than 70 accumulated cases, they have been basically assigned to the three prosecutors. When the number of cases increases, he himself will also handle a part of them. However, the court address is small and there are too few investigation courts, which is not enough for use. The detention center downstairs can only accommodate dozens of people.

According to the regulations of the Special Criminal Law, the use of a transfer letter means that the evidence is considered clear, and its effect is equivalent to a public prosecution by the prosecutor, so no further investigation will be conducted, and it will be tried directly by the judge. The Shenxin No. 9 Factory case was sent with an investigation report, and the investigation will begin in the next few days. As for the trial work, it will be launched simultaneously after Court President Wang Zhennan returns to Shanghai from Fenghua.

[Reported by This Newspaper] Following the publication of the Yang Jingzhou disappearance case by this newspaper, a reader named Zhou Jianying sent a letter yesterday, believing that Yang had committed suicide by drowning. It was claimed: "I traveled from Taiwan to Shanghai with Mr. Yang. When Mr. Yang boarded the ship, his nerves were already deranged, and he spoke irrationally. Everyone said he was ill. On the day of sailing, there were large waves, and all the passengers on board were either dizzy and vomiting or unable to move freely. Only I was able to move freely on the ship. Around 2:00 PM, Mr. Yang was again talking nonsense, saying things like: 'I am not a bad person, I am actually requesting a cost of living index for the workers, instigated by the communists,' etc. ... Later, he even spoke a preamble to suicide. We thought he was mentally disturbed and ignored him. At around 4:00 PM, because everyone had taken all the places, I felt unable to support myself sitting and sleeping, and wanted to find a place to rest, but there was no space anywhere. Later, I found the place where Mr. Yang had been sleeping, but he was no longer there. We waited until dawn and he still had not returned. Everyone suspected. Later, looking at all the items in his leather bag, and seeing the words published in various newspapers in his diary, it was confirmed that he had died by drowning," etc. After receiving the letter yesterday, this reporter planned to visit Mr. Zhou for detailed inquiries, but when visiting the address written on the letter, "No. 12, Chengde Lane, Maierxi Avenue," there was no such person as Zhou Jianying. Furthermore, according to Yang Jingzhou's family, Yang had absolutely no mental illness in Shanghai, so if he was indeed mentally disturbed when boarding the ship, it must have been caused by stimulation in Taiwan.

[Reported by This Newspaper, Taipei, 24th] Regarding the Yang Jingzhou disappearance case, the Keelung Port Police Bureau reported to the Provincial Police Department today that before boarding the ship, including during his stay in Keelung City and at the port, Yang did not encounter any encirclement or have his ticket robbed. As for whether he bought a ticket on board, it will only be confirmed after the Minzhong Steamer arrives.

### 薛衡之被捕　因洩漏軍機　曾人某師政訓主任　作戰失利一度被俘
Xue Hengzhi Arrested for Leaking Military Secrets; Formerly Served as Political Training Director of a Certain Division; Captured Once After Operational Failure

[Reported by This Newspaper] This newspaper reported yesterday that Xue Hengzhi, a senior staff member of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was arrested by the Garrison Command on suspicion of involvement in a case. Zhang Xihui, the director of the Fuel Management Committee, told this newspaper's reporter that Xue Hengzhi was introduced to the committee by someone on December 12th of last year and served as a specialist. Recently, because Shen Yunlong, the chief secretary of the committee, went to Beijing to attend the National Assembly Representatives Conference, Xue temporarily acted as the chief secretary, serving for only four months in total. As for Xue's arrest and interrogation by the Garrison Command, it was due to a case involving Xue during his tenure in a certain agency four months ago. Rumors of corruption are unconfirmed by me. However, it has nothing to do with the Fuel Management Committee. Later, this newspaper's reporter learned from other reliable sources that Xue is from Wujin, Jiangsu. He previously served as the political training director in a certain division of the National Army. Later, in a battle in a certain place in Shandong, he was defeated by the bandits and unfortunately captured. He did not escape until November and then came to Shanghai, where he was introduced by a friend to work in the Fuel Management Committee. However, it is heard that there were more than ten people who escaped from the bandit area with Xue this time. For some unknown reason, several of them secretly reported to the Ministry of National Defense that Xue was suspected of leaking important military secrets to the bandits. Therefore, the Ministry of National Defense telegraphed the Municipal Garrison Command to send two plainclothes officers to the Fuel Management Committee on the morning of the 23rd to arrest Xue. It is said that he will be sent to Beijing for interrogation within days.

[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhu Bing, the general manager of the Xinsui Company, who has been repeatedly accused of fraud, was sentenced yesterday in the District Court Detention Center for the fifth fraud case he was accused of. The facts of this case are that 24 paper companies in the city, including Minghua, Huakang, and Xingzhong, ordered more than 26,000 reams of Soviet newsprint from Zhu. At that time, they paid Zhu more than 3 billion yuan in deposits. Afterwards, Zhu was unable to deliver the goods, so Zhu compensated a portion of the money and issued checks from the Central Cooperative Treasury for 880 million yuan. However, when they were cashed, they were returned due to insufficient funds. Minghua and others then sued Zhu for fraud. Yesterday, Judge Mei Erhe pronounced the sentence: "Zhu Bing, jointly and continuously intending to illegally possess himself, used fraudulent means to cause others to deliver their own property, sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and when issuing the checks, intentionally exceeded the amount of deposits, fined 200 million yuan. If the fine is converted to labor, the total amount of the fine shall be converted into the number of days for six months. Other incidental civil suits shall be transferred to the Civil Court for handling. The company's staff members Shi Wenzhang and Wang Furong are not guilty."

Economic Police Break the Law; Collude to Embezzle Jewelry Gold from Jewelry Store; Abuse Power Under the Pretense of Investigating Black Market Transactions; Case Transferred to the District Procuratorate for Investigation

[Reported by This Newspaper] Cotton yarn broker Wu Haida knew economic policeman Zhang Lin. He heard Zhang say that if someone reported black market gold and currency transactions, they could get 30% of the bonus after the case was cracked. Wu, tempted by the benefit, discussed it with his friends Zhou Yunshan and Zhou Yunkuang. Zhou's brother-in-law, Shao Xingnan, was a clerk in the Telecommunications Bureau. He heard his colleagues Xiang Xiuquan and Zhou Jingwei talk about how the Baokang Jewelry Store on Xinzha Road was doing black market gold and currency trading. Shao told Wu and Zhou. Then Zhou Yunshan, using the pseudonym Zhou Zhen, reported to the Economic Police Brigade. On February 24, Economic Police Squad Leader Wang Shuci led police officers Zhang Lin and Gao Rucheng, as well as the informants, to search the Baokang Jewelry Store, No. 19 Zunrang Lane, Xiamen Road, and No. 14 Dongxiang Dian Lane, Da Road. They found 41 taels of gold bars and more than 270 million yuan in paper currency in Baokang's safe. They also found more than 100 taels of jewelry gold in a wooden box. At that time, the jewelry store argued reasonably that jewelry gold could not be used for black market trading by law and requested its return. Squad Leader Wang had already agreed, but Zhang Lin, Wu Haida, Zhou Yunshan, and others, seeing an opportunity, falsely claimed that they had found 30 taels of jewelry gold and took it to the bureau for investigation. The jewelry store handed over 30 taels of jewelry gold and gold bars to Wu to take away. The next day, they handed over the gold bars to the bureau, while they privately divided the jewelry gold. Zhang Lin and Gao Rucheng, fearing that the case would be exposed, asked for leave on the grounds of illness. Later, the police bureau became suspicious when Zhang and others did not return after a long absence. They summoned the Baokang Jewelry Store for questioning. After it was revealed that Zhang and others had acted corruptly, Zhang Lin and Gao Rucheng were dismissed, and Squad Leader Wang Shuci was detained. They were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation on charges of fraud. The court opened yesterday. Except for Qiang Lin and Gao Rucheng, who were on the run, all the above-mentioned suspects were present in court. The result was that Wang was still ordered to be detained, and the others were released on bail.

### Textile Factories Relocating South, The Consequences Are Worthy of Attention

[Report from this newspaper] Domestic industries have recently been relocating to Hong Kong one after another, which has attracted great attention from all parties. According to the opinion of a certain authoritative economic expert yesterday, the cotton textile industry has the greatest relationship with the national economy among the industries relocating to Hong Kong. It is reported that since last summer, six new cotton spinning factories have been established in Hong Kong. All the spindles have reached 120,000. The total capital has reached about HK$110 million. Except for Nanyang, which is a Sino-British joint venture, the rest are all Chinese capital. Recently, there are still two companies under preparation. Such a huge amount of capital flowing to Hong Kong will inevitably help to tighten Hong Kong's exchange rate. These yarn factories can produce 7,200 pieces of yarn per month, which is enough to meet the needs of Hong Kong's knitting and weaving industries. In the future, they can also be sold in Southeast Asia after expansion. Therefore, after the development of Hong Kong's cotton textile industry, our country's export of yarn and cloth will be greatly affected. Foreign exchange income will inevitably decrease. On the one hand, the domestic cotton yarn production will decrease, and the yarn price will be even more difficult to suppress. Looking forward to the future, it is very worrying, and I hope the government will pay attention. It is also reported that Hong Kong's raw cotton supply comes from India. The local wages are also very expensive, and it is really not an environment for the development of the cotton textile industry, and it will be difficult to maintain it permanently. At this moment, various industries are relocating to Hong Kong, aiming to escape domestic control. I don't know that the implementation of control in China is necessary due to the lack of foreign exchange and materials. Today, capital is escaping, making the lack of foreign exchange and materials even more severe, which is really not worthy of sympathy.

[This newspaper's Nanjing 24th dispatch] Since the implementation of import controls, Shanghai factories have been facing difficulties in the supply of raw materials, and the power supply is intermittent, coupled with the rising prices and the increase in the cost of living. Therefore, most factories have plans to relocate to Hong Kong. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry has also heard of this kind of rumors, but the number does not seem to be very large. The Ministry is closely investigating and paying attention to the actual situation. If the number of factories relocating to Hong Kong increases, the outflow of funds, the reduction of production, and the unemployment of workers will adversely affect my country's industry. There are many reasons for the relocation of factories to Hong Kong, and the difficulty in obtaining quota foreign exchange is the most important one. The Ministry has always paid great attention to relieving the difficulties suffered by the manufacturers, but if the allocation of quota foreign exchange can be improved, the difficulties will be easier to overcome.

### Qinxing Capital Increase

The factory's shareholders' extraordinary meeting on April 4 decided to send two and recognize three, that is, each old share can get five shares by paying 30 yuan in cash, and a total of six shares including the original share. The factory's original capital was 13.44 billion yuan, and the newly added capital was 67.2 billion yuan, making a total of 80.64 billion yuan.

### Bank of China Shareholders' Meeting, Re-elect Commercial Share Directors

[Report from this newspaper] The Bank of China held its 24th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders at 3 pm yesterday in the conference room on the 4th floor of the bank.

More than one hundred shareholders attended. First, General Manager Song read Chairman Kong's report to the General Meeting of Shareholders on his behalf, and then reported the bank's business situation in 1947. Then, Permanent Supervisor Liu Gonggai reported the final accounts and profit distribution plan for 1947. Finally, the commercial share directors were re-elected.

### The Export Promotion Office of the Transportation and Export Management Committee Formulated Two More Handling Principles

### Smuggling Exports Are Still Extremely Rampant, The Overseas Tung Oil Market Is Weak

[Report from this newspaper] According to the China Trust Bureau's Barter Department, the overseas tung oil market continued to weaken this week. The spot price in New York is US$0.245 per pound, while the US importers are selling futures for only US$0.2375 per pound, which proves that there must be other ways to obtain tung oil. 3,000 tons of goods arrived in New York last week, while very little has been shipped from Shanghai recently, and the price of oil in South China continues to increase, which all proves that the smuggling of tung oil exports is still extremely rampant. It is recently reported that a large number of tung oil in Guangdong Province is smuggled from Kaiping through Haikou, and it is hoped that the relevant departments will find ways to stop it. The overseas pig bristle market is stable and popular.

[Another dispatch] Since the China Trust Bureau adjusted the purchase price of tung oil on Monday this week, the purchase price is still about 20% different from the black market price, so it is still impossible to collect it in this city this week. The purchase price review committee will convene a meeting tomorrow to discuss it again.

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the spokesman for the Municipal Government made a statement regarding the strike by some students at Fudan University: (1) According to a verified report from the police局, the Municipal Government did not send any police officers to enter the university or conduct searches outside the university. If the students have factual evidence to present, the Municipal Government is still willing to continue investigating thoroughly. (2) Regarding the issue of entering the university to conduct searches, the Municipal Government has long ordered the police局 not to enter the university without special orders. If such a situation occurs, it should be considered a violation of orders, which the Municipal Government considers serious.

[Our Newspaper] Some students at Fudan University went on strike yesterday to protest the illegal search incident by unidentified individuals a few days ago. Today is Sunday, and classes may resume tomorrow. However, yesterday morning, amidst the strike, a new incident of conflict between students and a professor occurred. Professor Pan Zhenya of the law department at the university was unaware of the students' decision to strike and still went to school yesterday morning as usual to teach. In the first period "General Principles of Civil Law" class, because there were only four students in class, Professor Pan intended to stop teaching the regular course and switch to "casual remarks" to avoid the trouble of making up classes for other striking students in the future. This aroused the opposition of the students in class, who insisted on having the regular class taught. The wording was inevitably excessive, and Mr. Pan considered it an insult to teachers and "hindrance to academic freedom," so he left in anger and demanded that the Dean of Students punish the four students. Subsequently, the Law Society also argued that the professor had been insulted and made the same request. By yesterday afternoon, student groups posted notices criticizing the university's previous strikes and the fact that Professor Pan had participated in and supported this strike. After this new incident occurred, Mr. He Dehe, the Dean of Students, did not express an opinion, waiting for President Zhang Yi to return to the university to handle it. On the side of the striking students, yesterday afternoon, they went to Jiaotong University and St. John's University to report on the incident.

[Additional News] Chen Wangdao, the director of the journalism department at Fudan University, declined to comment to reporters yesterday, saying only: "I hope students will be calm and rational!"

### Students of Hebei Institute of Technology Pass Through Shanghai to Petition in Beijing to Recover Pre-War School Buildings

[Our Newspaper] Students from the Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology in Tianjin have been on strike since the 15th of this month to recover pre-war school property. The president of the institute, Lu Yinteng, is currently in Beijing lobbying, but there have been no results. The students also sent representatives Zhang Wanjun, Lü Zhigan, and others to pass through Shanghai last night to petition in Beijing. According to reports, the institute's pre-war school property includes two locations for the main campus and branch campus. The main campus has important equipment such as a hydraulic engineering laboratory, a textile museum, a chemical plant, a tannery, a paper mill, and a physics and chemistry laboratory. During the war, it was occupied by the enemy's wounded soldiers' hospital. After the victory, it was taken over by the Tianjin Rear General Hospital of the Combined Service Headquarters. Negotiations have been ongoing, but it has not been possible to recover it. Currently, the institute is facing a serious shortage of buildings. More than 600 students are crammed into a single branch campus, even the auditorium and boiler room are temporarily used for living, which is overcrowded. After the summer enrollment, the number of students will increase further, and the lack of housing will affect the hiring of professors. After organizing a committee to recover school property and appealing without results, the students went on strike on the 15th and organized a petition group to go to Beijing, submitting petitions to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, the Beiping Executive Headquarters, the Hebei Provincial Government, and the Provincial Assembly. The mission of the student representatives who are petitioning in Beijing this time is only to support President Lu's negotiations in Beijing, to report to the relevant parties about the current serious housing shortage, and to request assistance.

### On Mutual Assistance

— Wu Yong

"Heaven helps those who help themselves"—this sentence can only be used as a slogan to encourage people to be independent, but it cannot be used as an excuse to refuse to help those in danger. There should be no inferiority of dependence between people, but everyone must have the psychology of mutual assistance.

But if we want to get help from others, we must first help others, just as if you want others to love you, you must first love others. When we fail in our careers and come to the end of the road, we often say things like "people are indifferent" and "the world is cold," but we have to ask ourselves: Have we never had an indifferent attitude in our dealings with people? The saying "Rely on your parents at home, rely on your friends when you go out" does not mean that we should have a psychology of dependence on friends, but rather indicates the attitude we should have towards friends. We should not expect anything in return when we help others; but if you help others, they will naturally come to help you, this is a certain truth. Therefore, Mr. Xiong once said: "Heaven helps those who help others."

I once read an article in a Western magazine about "sacrificing oneself to help others." The article described an American paratrooper who landed in the German defense line in France during World War II. In order to avoid being captured by the Germans, he asked a French woman to protect him; this woman readily agreed to hide the paratrooper in her wardrobe, but soon the Germans found him, and the Germans immediately arrested the French woman's husband and shot him in the open space in front of the door. The paratrooper managed to escape while being escorted to the camp. German soldiers were chasing behind him. The paratrooper looked around, and there was no other place to hide except the French woman's house; the paratrooper tiptoed back to the house. He saw the body of the French man who had been shot by the German soldiers still lying in the open space in front of the door, and the French woman was standing at the door crying. He went forward and asked her to protect him again. The woman readily agreed again, without any difficulty. The paratrooper was thus saved. This French woman understood the righteousness and can be said to understand the true meaning of mutual assistance. This kind of behavior is the most noble manifestation of the spirit of mutual assistance.

However, since Darwin advocated the theory of "survival of the fittest," some scholars have believed that helping the poor and weak hinders the evolution of human beings. The English scholar Spencer is one of them. In his "Study of Sociology," he said: "By the practice of natural selection, the creator eliminates those who are incompetent, and everyone is responsible for their own independence, and their group will prosper; but the ignorant use tenderness to destroy the work of heaven, so that they cannot have the effect of advancing the group." His intention is that society is a battlefield, the winners are the excellent ones, and the losers are the bad elements, which is a natural elimination process; if we help the weak, it will not be beneficial to the evolution of society, but harmful. This kind of statement is not only too cruel, but according to this reasoning, those cruel elements in society who only care about their own private interests and do not care about the life or death of others should be the backbone of the human group, and those who hold the spirit of sacrificing oneself to save others are fools. Just as Spencer himself said: "To the fullest extent, all things that suppress the strong, forbid the tyrannical, and prevent fraud are all permissible, why? Because all of these are to save those who cannot save themselves and protect those who cannot protect themselves, all of these will allow the weak and inferior people to survive and extend their descendants. And to extend the discussion, medical techniques and strategies can not be discussed, and dangers can not be prevented, why? Because they all hone the quality of the people, so that they finally reach the strongest, and make those who are not suitable have no surviving species." I ask, is there such a reason in the world?

It must be known that mutual assistance is also one of the most necessary conditions in the struggle for survival. Kropotkin, the author of "Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution", said well: "In the animal kingdom, forward development is parallel to mutual assistance, and backward steps are accompanied by mutual quarrels among animals. In the case of human beings, two conflicting countries, cities, parties, or tribes, when they fight each other, the victors always belong to the side that is very capable of mutual assistance internally."

### Dawn on the Lake

— Lei Hong

The boat is next to the foot of "Zhongdu Mountain," and the surroundings on the lake are so dark that nothing can be seen. Fortunately, there is a crescent moon, illuminating the mountain path, climbing the steps, entering a wall, looking for a small path among the bushes, and climbing up, a spacious house is built on the mountainside, this is the Zuile Hall of Xiaopenglaishan Hall, where we are staying.

A kerosene lamp is hung inside the house, which is the only light in the mountains. Looking out over the lake from here, with the help of the weak moonlight, it is possible to vaguely identify a distant mountain. And the surroundings are quiet, and the rustling sound of the waves hitting the shore can also be heard. A wild dog is kept on the mountain, barking madly at strangers, which is the only rebel who breaks through the tourists' whispers and is uneasy with loneliness.

We had dinner and went to sleep to watch the dawn rise in the morning. Most of the tourists could not sleep well, finding the old woman to ask for tea and water. The old woman, while preparing tea and water, chatted with the tourists, and it was not until after twelve o'clock that it was deep and quiet, and everyone went to sleep.

I slept until 4:30 in the morning, and could no longer close my eyes, so I got dressed and got up. The old woman had already gotten up refreshed to prepare tea and water for the tourists. At this time, the sky was slightly dawn, and there were already two or three cloth sails moving slowly on the lake. There was a line of dawn in the east, which was a touch of red glow in the gray sky. The south is Yuantouzhu, which is shrouded in thick fog, and the houses and trees cannot be distinguished.

The place of the red glow gradually released golden light, and the rising sun was so dazzlingly red, like God tearing his arm and sprinkling dots of blood in the lead-gray sky. The rising of the initial sun is very amazing, and in just two or three minutes, a "crescent-shaped" sun has appeared, and the surrounding clouds are becoming more and more bright. The four sides are dawn, and looking at the fog on the opposite mountain, it is still lingering in a circle, staying on the top of the mountain and reluctant to leave.

The sun rose again, and in less than ten minutes, it had completely emerged. A breeze blew from the face, so the mountains were green and the water was clear, and the cloth sail attached to the distance looked so stable, as if it would not be disturbed by the world.

The red-tiled foreign houses in the south, mixed in the green trees, are illuminated by the sun, and they are even more brilliant as a painting.

### Lin Baishui, Shao Piaoping, Zhang Hanjü

— Yi Yun

In the old days of Beiping during the warlord era, freedom of speech was extremely restricted, and journalists were in danger of being killed if they were not careful. Lin Baishui, the chief of the Social Daily, liked to make jokes in his editorials, and his newspaper sold well because of this. When Huang Fu was in power, he often mocked and ridiculed him. When the Zhili-Lu army rose up, he occasionally quoted the "Miscellaneous Secrets," a blasphemous phrase, joking and close to abuse, and finally touched the anger of the warlord, and he was arrested and killed. It is said that when he was arrested, he wrote a will, the first sentence of which was "My life is at stake," which is sad.

At the same time, Shao Piaoping of the Jingbao died after Lin. It was heard that after Lin's change, he had been hiding in Jiaominxiang, not daring to go out easily. Gu's concubine was at home, and there was a fierce quarrel with his wife. He was very eager to return, so he called Zhang Hanjü, a colleague, to inquire. Zhang strongly said that there was no harm. Shao believed him, and as soon as his car left Jiaominxiang, he was arrested and killed. Shao liked to dress up, his clothes were beautiful, and even at the age of not惑, he was still as handsome as a young man. When he spoke to people, his voice was extremely low and harmonious. If the newspaper's funds were occasionally depleted, he would pawn his clothes to fill the gap, which was quite pleasing to his colleagues. Many people regretted his death.

Zhang Hanjü, whose name was Peng, was nicknamed "Night叉 Zhang San." At that time, he was representing a certain garrison commander as a journalist, and he was very powerful, so Shao wanted to go out, and he first called Zhang to decide. He was actually misled. In fact, Zhang's men had long been monitored by secret reports. As soon as Zhang Zongchang arrived, he would die after Lin Shao, but Zhang did not know it. Fortunately, Li, the chief of police, had an old relationship with Zhang. When Zongchang was about to arrive, Li Daoying was on the special car, and when he spoke about Zhang's affairs, Li laughed and said, He is the so-called Night叉 Zhang San, the marshal's bullets are precious, it is a pity to shoot a Night叉. The language was extremely humorous, Zongchang laughed, and Zhang was spared. The next year, a certain famous actor's house suddenly came to a violent guest, extorting a huge sum of money. Zhang helped to deal with it, but he was shot and killed. Zhang did not die in the newspaper, but died at the hands of a violent guest, which was also Zhang's misfortune.

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

The most pathetic people in the world are those with the most prejudices. But a person without prejudice is unlovable.

Have you read Wilde's prose poems? He tells us that "temporary happiness" is made of "eternal sorrow."

The strongest memory of mankind is God's most cruel arrangement.

Lying is a beautiful art, but also a dangerous game.

A person without imagination is a fool; a person with too much imagination is a madman.

Time is water, it has washed away the color of how much powder and rouge.

### Kunming Bamboo Branch Lyrics

— Bi Jue

The Golden Horse Archway faces the Emerald Chicken, That man's workshop is north, and the concubine's workshop is west. They look at each other every morning but can't meet, Crows crow every day and night in the workshop.

All day long rowing a boat by the side of the Haizi (Dian people call Cui Lake the vegetable Haizi, and its surroundings are called Haizi side), Apricot-red shirt and emerald hairpin, They say they are not as good as dragonflies, They can sleep in the depths of the lotus flower.

The Western Hills are easy to set, and the setting sun slants, Not seeing the returning sails, returning alone, The camellia on the head is still red, Pairs of canyon butterflies fly beside people.

The carp under the fish pond are fat, The stream girl sits beside the old man fishing, Getting up early to pick fish to sell at the foot of the mountain, The setting sun helps the drunk to return.

The weeping willow in the corner of the house sleeps on the ground, Our family (Dian people call people you, call themselves self or our family) lives in front of Caohu (Dianchi is also known as Qingcao Lake), The tide water in front of the door is thousands of feet deep, Where is the man at the head of the tide?

### Inducing Jade

— He Tianjian

I recently participated in a cherry blossom viewing party and wrote two poems, which were disclosed in this publication; for a time, replies and simple letters came in, and it has not stopped so far. The number of people is as many as forty or fifty, and the region is as wide as from this city and Nantong to Nanjing and Hangzhou, and perhaps it may extend to other places, which is a grand event.

Although I like poetry all my life, I regret that it is not skilled. I only occasionally use rhymes because of my emotions; and the poems of all the gentlemen that I have obtained this time are exceptionally exquisite, and Gao Qingqiu said that poetry must emphasize intention, style, and rhyme. The poems of all the gentlemen are truly sincere and lively, the style is high and peaceful, and the rhyme is secluded and bright. My throwing a brick to attract jade, I did not expect to see it here! Is it not a great pleasure in fifty years!

The cherry blossom viewing party was held by the local chief executive, and its significance is not only to share happiness with the people, but also to promote the essence of national culture, and poetry is the best way to inspire emotions. In theory, a publication should be published so that the works can be collected into a book as a memorial. If this is done every year, it will be beneficial to the people of the country to learn from the past and be vigilant, but I have not heard of any such measures, what can I do!

I returned home yesterday from visiting the tomb, so I took the opportunity to go to Yixing to climb Tumo Mountain and the highest West Shen Mountain in my hometown. At that time, I did not feel tired, but I did not expect that two days later, my toothache was like a sting, and my body was as hot as a fire, which was caused by the wind and heat inside. While lying in bed, I read the poems of all the gentlemen, recited them in cycles, and was infinitely happy. How can I make the efforts of all the gentlemen not be wasted? I am trying to find a way to reply to each one, but because my physical strength still needs to be recovered, I cannot use my brain power too much. I will gradually respond, fortunately, all the gentlemen have addresses, so I take this opportunity to thank you.

### A Father's Appointment

— Ge Chunliang

——This story was told to me by a friend of mine. Now that he has passed away, I feel it's okay to share it...

This story took place in a charming Dutch inn, which catered specifically to travelers. At the time, my father and I were traveling together, enjoying ourselves immensely.

"It's a pity your mother couldn't come," Father said, "taking her around would surely make her happy."

He had been to Holland in his younger days. I asked him, "How many years ago were you here?"

"Hmm, probably thirty years ago. I remember being in this inn too..." He looked around, searching for his memories. "Those were beautiful days—" He suddenly stopped speaking. I saw his face turn pale. I followed his gaze and saw a woman carrying a tray, serving wine to customers. She must have been beautiful once, but now she was stout and her hair was unkempt. "Do you know her?" I asked.

"I used to," he said.

The woman came to our table and rudely asked, "Drinking?"

"Beer," I said. The woman nodded and left.

"She's changed so much! Thank goodness she didn't recognize me," Father muttered, wiping the sweat from his face with a handkerchief. "Before I met your mother, I knew her," he continued. "Back then, I was a student, traveling. She was a lovely young woman, very dignified and noble. I fell madly in love with her, and she loved me too."

"Does Mother know her?" I blurted out, not very pleased.

"Of course," Father said gently.

He looked at me with some trepidation, and I felt a little embarrassed for him.

I said, "Dad, you really don't have to tell me—"

"Oh, I want to tell you. I don't want you to misinterpret. Her father was against our love. I was a foreigner with no future or prospects, relying on my father's support. I wrote to my father saying I wanted to get married, and he immediately cut off my allowance. So, I had to go home. But I met with the young woman one last time and told her I was going back to America to borrow money to get married, and that I would return in a few months to meet her."

He continued, "We knew her father might intercept the letters, so we agreed that I would just send her a slip of paper with a date written on it. On that day, she would come to a prearranged place to meet me, and we would get married. Ah, so I went home to borrow money and sent her that date."

"And then what?" I asked.

"She received the note. She wrote back saying, 'I will definitely be there.' But she didn't come. Later, I found out that she had gotten married two weeks earlier, to a local hotel owner. She didn't wait for me."

Then, my father said, "Thank God she didn't come. I went home, met your mother, and we have been very happy ever since. We often joke about that ridiculous love story."

The woman brought our beer.

"Are you from America?" she asked me.

"Yes," I said.

Her face lit up and she said, "America, a lovely place!"

"Yes, many people from your country go to America to seek their fortunes. Do you want to go too?"

"I'm not going. Definitely not now!" she said. "There was a time when I thought about it, long, long ago. But I stayed here. It's better here." We finished our beer and walked out.

Outside, I said, "Father, how did you write the date for your appointment?"

He stopped, took out an envelope, and wrote 12/71/13 on it. "Like this," he said, "12/11/13. Twelve, eleven, thirteen; of course! Meaning December eleventh, in nineteen thirteen."

"No!" I exclaimed. "That's how Americans write it, but not in Denmark or any other European country. Here, they write the day first, then the month. So, the date you wrote wasn't December eleventh, but November twelfth!"

Father covered his face with his hands and said, "Ah, so she did go!" He cried out, "It was because I didn't show up that she waited for me in vain and went off to marry someone else." He was silent for a moment. "Ah," he said, "I hope she's happy here. She seems happy!"

As we continued our stroll, I said, "It's lucky that's how it happened, or you wouldn't have met Mother."

He put his arm around my shoulders, a warm smile on his face, and said, "Son, I feel doubly lucky! Because, otherwise, I wouldn't have met you either!"
