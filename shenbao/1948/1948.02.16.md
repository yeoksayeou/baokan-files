### The Four Allied Banks Board of Directors to Reconvene on Thursday; Loan Policy to be Revised; Increase in Agricultural Loans and Higher Interest Rates

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Four Allied Banks Board of Directors, which has been suspended for two months, is scheduled to reconvene on the morning of the 19th of this month. The secretariat of the Four Allied Banks has already issued meeting notices, and unless there are unforeseen circumstances, it should not be postponed. This meeting is being held upon the instruction of Zhang Qun, the vice chairman of the Four Allied Banks Board of Directors, who will preside over the meeting. If Chairman Chiang has returned to Nanjing by the time of the meeting, he may also personally attend and provide important instructions. The main topic of the meeting is to discuss the loan policy for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948], which can be divided into two parts: agricultural loans and general loans (including industrial loans). Regarding this year's loan plan, the head office of the Four Allied Banks previously sought opinions from the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury. It has now received plans from the Farmers Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Postal Savings Bureau, China Trust Bureau, and Cooperative Treasury. The Central Bank's opinions on loans and this year's loan plan will also be submitted on the 16th. The head office of the Four Allied Banks has also received opinions from relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, which will be compiled along with the texts published by various experts, newspaper editorials on loans, and relevant data on past loans of the Four Allied Banks, and submitted to the board of directors for discussion on the 19th. It is understood that the loan policy for the 37th year will be revised to some extent compared to the 36th year. The head office of the Four Allied Banks is currently considering the following points, which will be submitted to the board of directors on the 19th: (1) Increase agricultural loans. In the past, the ratio of agricultural loans to industrial loans was two to three, with industrial loans being more than agricultural loans. This year, agricultural loans will be the top priority. Chairman Chiang has instructed the Four Allied Banks to this effect. The Farmers Bank of China has already drafted a plan for this year's agricultural loans. (3) The method of lending will adopt an order-based approach. (4) The principle of lending will be a tight policy, narrowing the scope, and strictly reviewing the scope of loans, initially limiting them to six categories of daily necessities, public utilities, transportation, and export businesses. (4) Regarding loan interest rates, the past low-interest policy easily led to hoarding, and the national banks, bureaus, and treasuries also suffered losses. This year's loan interest rates will be increased. During the discussion on the 19th, the current "Investment Discount Policy" and "Revised Discount Principles" will also be revised in conjunction with the above four points to serve as the loan policy for the 37th year.

The Ministry of Finance to Adopt a Supervision System to Increase Tax Revenue

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] In order to increase national tax revenue and boost the national treasury, the Ministry of Finance is actively implementing tax improvements. In addition to the adoption of estimated tax payments for profit-seeking enterprise income tax in the 37th year and the full implementation of ad valorem taxation, with tax rates adjusted monthly, the Ministry of Finance is now planning to adopt a supervision system for tax promotion. In the coming six months, the competent tax authorities will prepare a schedule of progress in advance and promote it step by step. If it cannot be implemented accordingly, the Ministry of Finance can supervise it. Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun recently convened Director Wang Fuzhou of the Direct Tax Department and Director Jiang Shuge of the Tax Affairs Department to discuss implementation measures. Wang and Jiang have already drafted a semi-annual progress schedule and submitted it to Yu for approval.

### Implementation Plan for Grain Rationing in Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou Drafted; Initial Four Months Require More Than 350,000 Tons of Grain

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The grain rationing plan for the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou will have an initial trial period of four months, starting in March or April. After the trial period, it will be extended as needed, depending on the actual situation. According to Miao Jianming, chairman of the Sino-American Relief Materials Processing Committee, the committee has drafted an implementation plan stipulating that anyone with residency in the five cities can enjoy this right, receiving one dou [approx. 10 liters] per person, totaling 352,000 tons of grain for four months. Half of this will be allocated from American relief materials, and the other half will be arranged by the Ministry of Food. According to sources in the Ministry of Food, the grain supply has been secured and the distribution will not be a problem, as it is calculated based on the population of the cities, with one dou per person. The grain price has been tentatively set at 5% lower than the market price, and the proceeds from the sales will be used for relief purposes. The relief targets will be national in scope. Furthermore, the grain price for rationed grain will be adjusted monthly.

According to sources in the Ministry of Food: The rationing plan for the five major cities stipulates that each person, regardless of age, will receive one dou, of which five sheng [approx. 5 liters] will be rationed by the government, and five sheng will be relief rice, both priced 5% lower than the market price. There is also one dou for large consumers, which can be purchased from the market with a rationing certificate, with the aim of controlling the market.

### Yu Feipeng Speaks on Rationing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] On the eve of the opening of the five-city grain rationing conference, Minister of Food Yu Feipeng spoke about the rationing issue, stating that the reason for selecting the five major cities for initial implementation is that these five cities have dense populations and large consumption volumes. The main reason for adopting grain rationing is to stabilize grain prices and maintain social stability. Yu said with firm conviction as the rationing was about to begin: "I believe that grain prices can be stabilized to a considerable extent after the implementation of the rationing system." The theme of this rationing conference is the discussion of general technical issues, such as coordinating grain sources, determining grain prices, transportation, storage, distribution, and the issuance of purchase certificates. It is also learned that in addition to the mayors and directors of social affairs bureaus of the five cities, the directors of the field and grain departments of Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Hebei provinces, representatives from the Guangzhou and Peiping banks, and units such as the Sino-American Relief Materials Processing Committee, the Central Bank, China Trust Bureau, and the Ministry of Social Affairs are also participating.

The proposals have been submitted to the conference for discussion, and the Sino-American Relief Materials Committee has also drafted measures for rationing and implementation to be submitted to the conference for discussion. The opening was originally scheduled for today, but due to the incomplete attendance, it may be postponed again.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] He Siyuan and Du Jianshi, the mayors of Peiping and Tianjin, respectively, and the directors of the social affairs bureaus of the two cities, are scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the morning of the 16th on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight to attend the five-city grain conference.

### Xie Chengping's Remarks

All Countries Should Help Each Other with Rice

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Xie Chengping, the Vice Minister of Agriculture, recently stated the Chinese government's attitude toward the four international conferences related to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), saying: (1) Rice issues: Rice production varies from country to country, but under the principle of helping each other, some people should not be left to starve. Our country's current grain supply is also insufficient, and we are stepping up production to achieve self-sufficiency and cooperate with other countries' grain to exchange what we have for what we lack. (2) Nutrition issues: At this conference, nutritional standards for Asia and the tropics will be drafted, and we will abide by these standards to improve the nutrition of our compatriots. (3) Fisheries issues: China has the longest coastline and is suitable for various aquatic products. Therefore, we propose fisheries improvement to make contributions. (4) FAO Far East Regional Office: We request that it be located in our country.

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Harrison, a former member of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, gave a speech at the Sino-British Association tonight, expressing his views on China. He said: "China is now moving towards democracy. For example, the general election is not only a major event for the current people, but also for the future of the country." He expressed his admiration for Chairman Chiang, praising him as one of the greatest figures in the world, and one who is most insightful about world issues. He disagreed with The Times' claim that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is unlike the Soviet Communist Party. He said: "The CCP, the Soviet Communist Party, and the British Communist Party are all the same." He believes that compromise between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP is impossible. He said: "Anyone who persuades the Chinese government to compromise with the CCP is tantamount to asking it to commit suicide." He is confident that despite various difficulties, China can still become one of the greatest countries and the greatest nations on Earth in the near future. Lord Amory, the leader of last year's parliamentary delegation to China, also praised Chairman Chiang and his wife, saying that Chairman Chiang is undoubtedly a great man. Lord Amory was particularly impressed by the enthusiasm and spirit of Chinese university students. Although the buildings of various schools were damaged and the facilities were incomplete, teachers and students still performed remarkably. As for middle school students, they have the spirit of sacrificing for the country, which is China's hope. Lord Amory also said that he laid a wreath at Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum, and said, "People in London feel that Dr. Sun belongs to us almost as much as he belongs to China." He believes that the quickest way to bring China and Britain together is to open up China's waterways for international shipping. He hopes that China will never become as materialistic as Western countries, and lose its ancient philosophy and research in literature and science. If China's economic difficulties can be solved, it will become one of the world's great nations. Lord Amory quoted Foreign Secretary Bevin as saying that if China and Britain can work together, the two countries will be able to maintain world peace forever.

### We Are Closely Watching the Decline in U.S. Commodity Prices and Securities and Their Development; Observers Believe It Is Not an Economic Panic

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] People in Nanjing are paying close attention to the recent decline in U.S. securities and commodity prices. Relevant people are collecting data, conducting research, and closely watching its development. According to a qualified economic observer speaking to reporters on the 15th, the recent decline in U.S. commodity prices and securities cannot be immediately judged due to a lack of sufficient data, but it can be asserted that this decline is not an economic panic, but only a temporary phenomenon. The reasons for the decline may be the following two: (1) The U.S. had wartime overproduction, and people's purchasing power is weak, but the U.S. is also a country with inflation, and commodity prices and currency should be proportional. The decline in commodity prices is only a temporary phenomenon. (2) It may be due to political reasons, or factional struggles related to the general election. However, no matter what the reason, it will promote the realization of U.S. foreign aid, which will benefit aid to China.

### U.S. Anti-Communist Policy Focuses on Europe First; Opinions Expressed by Washington Officials

[United Press, Washington, 15th] U.S. government officials believe on the 15th that as the U.S. promotes the political and economic strategy of the Marshall Plan in Europe to stem the expansion of communist forces, the U.S. government will "observe quietly" the Soviet Union in the Far East for the next three or four years, holding its current positions in Japan and South Korea, and focus on defeating communism in Europe. U.S. officials acknowledge that Marshall agreed to propose an aid plan for China this year only to appease Republicans in Congress and maintain a bipartisan foreign policy front. According to reliable sources, Marshall and State Department officials feel that $570 million in aid to China over 15 months is insufficient to alleviate China's suffering.

### Our Plan to Support Japan's Reconstruction; China to Support with Conditions; Principle: No Resurgence of Japanese Militarism

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Regarding the United States' proposal to the Far Eastern Commission to support Japan's reconstruction plan and seek the agreement of the Allied nations, the Chinese government, after receiving the U.S. note at the end of last month and deliberating for over ten days, has finalized its policy. Foreign Minister Wang met with Ambassador Stuart on the 2nd of this month to discuss the matter, stating that China will support this proposal with conditions, but reserves the right to demand reparations from Japan without being affected by these measures to restore the Japanese economy. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Gu Weijun, our representative to the Far Eastern Commission and Ambassador to the United States, to support the U.S. plan under the general principle of not allowing the resurgence of Japanese militarism and aggression. However, under any circumstances, if the original measures clearly promote Japan's re-entry into the Far Eastern market commercially, threatening the industrial and commercial development of the Allied nations, and causing Japan's old face to re-emerge through financial cliques, thereby embarking on economic expansion and forming the basis for political aggression, China will carefully consider maintaining a firm stance at any time. Foreign Minister Wang touched on this issue in his report to the National Political Council on the 13th, stating: "World peace is indivisible, and the world's economic recovery is equally indivisible," and expressed China's willingness to see the economic recovery of enemy countries. According to an analysis by relevant sources, the government's decision on this issue is not simple. In addition to considering the lessons of Germany after the last World War, so that Japan retains the ability to pay reparations, so as to avoid its economic collapse before the peace treaty is signed, the main reason is to support the Marshall Plan's massive world economic recovery plan. By restoring and stabilizing the social order of countries suffering from war around the world, we seek the necessary conditions for the early arrival of world peace. China has agreed with the U.S. view that even if a peace treaty can be signed at any price, a world full of chaos and famine is insufficient to maintain the peace provided by the treaty. As the opportunity to convene a peace conference is difficult to find, Marshall's method of starting with economic and social stability, in order to maintain the current situation and avoid further confusion, so as to preserve the hope of seeking early peace, or to cope with possible future changes, is still worth considering.

According to official naval sources here, regarding the missing Marines, apart from what is known in Washington and what is mentioned in other telegrams and broadcast by a Chinese Communist radio station in northern Shaanxi, there is no new information.

[Associated Press, London, 14th] TASS reported on the 14th: "The 'General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army' operating in eastern Shandong has issued a strong protest to the U.S. Navy authorities in China, demanding a guarantee that U.S. officers will not participate in the Chinese civil war, otherwise the U.S. government and the U.S. military will be responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom."

The telegram quoted a report from the Chinese Communist side stating that since October 1945, U.S. military personnel have continuously taken very planned "aggressive" actions against the Chinese liberated areas. The main ones are as follows: On October 4, 1945, a U.S. destroyer suddenly entered Yantai, and the captain landed, demanding that the "People's Liberation Army" immediately hand over the administrative power of the city to the U.S. military. In December 1945, the U.S. military occupied Qinhuangdao and turned Qinhuangdao into an outer fortress for the National Army to attack Shanhaiguan, thereby paving the way for the Nationalist troops to go to Shanhaiguan. In June and July 1946, the U.S. military defended the Ping-Shen Railway for the National Army and, in a planned manner, entered eastern Hebei, which was under the control of the "People's Army."

[Associated Press, Pearl Harbor, 14th] U.S. Under Secretary of the Navy Kenney announced here on the 14th while hosting a press conference that the 84 American civilians in the Qingdao area, including naval dependents, are currently facing the threat of being surrounded by the Chinese Communists. If necessary, naval aircraft will be sent to evacuate them. Kenney also said that the evacuation plan is purely routine. The new Commander of the U.S. Navy in the Western Pacific, Vice Admiral Badger, is on his way to Qingdao and also attended the press conference on the 14th. Badger left here on the evening of the 14th with Admiral Ramsay, Commander of the Pacific Fleet. Admiral Ramsay will spend three weeks inspecting various bases in the Pacific. Vice Admiral Badger said that he was very interested in accepting the new appointment and planned to hold this position for as long as policy permits. The Commander of the Pacific Fleet announced that the closure of various bases in the Pacific has, in fact, been completed. He said that apart from a small amount of materials on Guam and Saipan, the Navy has cleared all remaining materials.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 15th] The British Embassy in Nanjing has confirmed that British nationals in the Northeast and North China threatened areas have been notified to register immediately, except for those who voluntarily risk entering the Communist areas, for evacuation purposes. This confidential advice is a precautionary measure by the British authorities to allow for a quick evacuation of their nationals if necessary. To avoid double evacuations, the British authorities also advised British nationals not to go to areas that will need to be evacuated in the future, but to go to Shanghai and cities south of the Yangtze River. A spokesman for the British Embassy said that this is a precautionary measure taken in view of the lack of aircraft that the British authorities can deploy in China. The U.S. consulates in Shenyang and Changchun have recently been closed, but U.S. Consul General in Shenyang, Walter, has returned to Shenyang after a trip to Washington and is preparing to live with other consulate staff. He had discussed this matter with the U.S. State Department while in Washington.

U.S. Navy to Remain in Qingdao to Train Our Military Students

[United Press, Pearl Harbor, 14th] U.S. Under Secretary of the Navy Kenney told reporters on the 14th that to his knowledge, the U.S. Navy will remain in Qingdao to train Chinese naval students. If the Communist Party occupies Qingdao, the Navy will evacuate American nationals. Qingdao has once again been threatened by the Communists, and there are 814 American nationals in the area. The number of Navy and Marine Corps personnel is unknown.

### A Demonstration of Moral Education – Congratulations to the National Catholic Education Conference –

The National Catholic Education Conference opened grandly in Shanghai yesterday. It was presided over by Archbishop Liberec, the Papal Legate to China, Cardinal Archbishop Tian Gengxin, and Archbishop Yu Bin of the Nanjing Diocese. Hundreds of representatives from 130 dioceses across the country attended, making it an unprecedented grand event in the history of Catholic education in China. The conference is scheduled to last for a week, and a national exhibition of the achievements of Catholic schools will be held simultaneously to provide a reference for the representatives to discuss how to improve education in each diocese. Educational experts representing seven nationalities will present their valuable opinions on Catholic education issues and plans. It is expected that the conference will make important resolutions on establishing a general organization for Catholic education to promote full cooperation among the dioceses. At a time when the world deeply feels the lack of moral education, and especially today when the Communists are spreading seeds of anti-religion and anti-morality everywhere, a religious group representing the moral authority of the world is holding a conference in this city to conduct a self-examination of the theory and practice of its educational work. This will make a significant contribution to how to reverse the declining trend of modern education in the moral aspect. Although we are unwilling to overstate the significance of this National Catholic Education Conference, saying that it can immediately lead Chinese education uphill, its significance cannot be ignored; at the very least, this conference should be a useful reference for the improvement of Chinese education.

Catholicism has been transmitted to China since the late Ming Dynasty, and it has had a profound influence on Chinese society and culture. The Catholic Church is organized by people who believe in the doctrines and live in human society, and naturally it cannot but have relationships with the real society. All changes and migrations of people and affairs, the rise and fall of society, since Catholicism exists in it, it is naturally impossible not to have contact with it. Moreover, many social problems cannot be solved without ethics, and the ethics and morality of human society are always related to religion. What's more, since Catholicism was introduced into China, it has made great efforts to promote the popularization of education in our country. Therefore, the influence of Catholicism on Chinese society cannot be ignored. Even if the number of Catholic friends across the country reaches four or five million, accounting for one in ten thousand of the total population, it is not comparable to ordinary social groups. Taking education alone, Catholicism attaches special importance to the education of Catholics. All Catholic children, whether in cities or villages, must go to school to read scriptures. Even in remote rural areas, there are schools founded by Catholics. Catholicism not only emphasizes basic education, but also devotes itself to secondary and higher education. Xuhui Middle School and Xuhui Girls' High School in Xujiahui have a history of 81 years and are probably one of the earliest schools in Shanghai. Before our government advocated modern school education, Catholicism had already founded primary and secondary schools all over the country. According to recent statistics, there are 52 boys' middle schools, 36 girls' middle schools, 297 boys' senior elementary schools, 183 girls' senior elementary schools, 2,617 boys' junior elementary schools, and 1,020 girls' junior elementary schools in the country. In addition, there are also 11,523 simplified elementary schools. From this, we can see how developed Catholic education is in the country and how significant its impact on Chinese society and culture is.

If we examine the content of Catholic schools across the country, we can know that Catholic church schools all emphasize the principles of being a person; in their schools, all courses inspire students' conscience, and all activities take into account students' moral cultivation. Therefore, the purpose of Catholic education, in a nutshell, is to integrate school education with social education; in other words, to make society more perfect and to make human life more meaningful. As Archbishop Yu Bin said, "The task of our religious educators is not only to cultivate perfect people and promote morality, but also to make everyone a manifestation of Christ." This educational policy is enough to make up for the shortcomings of our current education. At a time when the world deeply feels the lack of personality education and moral education, Catholic education's emphasis on personality cultivation and moral cultivation is especially worthy of advocacy. Therefore, we hope that this conference, while examining the theory and practice of Catholic education, should uphold the standards of moral education and strive to reverse the declining trend of morality in our country's current education!

If we look at the distribution of Catholic schools across the country, the focus is on North China. Taking Beijing alone, there are 12 Catholic middle schools and one Furen University in the urban area. However, North China has been disturbed by the Communists, and there is almost no clean land. The Communists do all kinds of evil and wantonly destroy religious undertakings in their occupied areas, so Catholics have suffered the most tragic poisoning by the Communists. Cardinal Archbishop Tian Gengxin, who came to Shanghai from Beijing, told reporters from the Central News Agency the day before yesterday: "There are more than two or three thousand Catholics in Beijing who have escaped from various places occupied by the Communists, many of whom have been arrested and detained by the Communists. Although missionary work in the Communist areas of China is now extremely difficult, the church has never considered a plan to withdraw. The reason is that Catholicism has suffered more than a thousand years of tempering from complete or partial suffering in various countries around the world; the difficult history has made us more determined to fight against evil forces." Many of the representatives attending this conference are from North China, and some of them must have suffered poisoning and oppression from the Communists. We would like to pay our sincere respect to them and express our heartfelt admiration for their unyielding spirit. At the same time, we hope that the representatives of various dioceses attending this conference can follow this spirit and fight evil forces to the end.

The Communists are creating disturbances by playing with soldiers, on the one hand, trying to expand their territory by force, and on the other hand, using ideological struggle as a tool to destroy the ethical concepts of human interaction. Therefore, from the perspective of the country and the nation, the Communists are traitors to the country and public enemies of the nation; from the perspective of religion and morality, the Communists are even more enemies of all mankind. In addition to seeking the unity of the church itself and the connection of work, this conference should also pay attention to the development of national spirit and the establishment of righteous concepts. On the active side, take education as a demonstration to achieve the revival of national morality; on the negative side, implement spiritual mobilization, participate in ideological suppression, and crush any poisonous schemes of the Communists to destroy ethics and destroy morality, so that the next generation of citizens of the Republic of China will never fall into the abyss of chaos and suffering created by the Communists.

Finally, we must also study the doctrines of Catholicism. It is definitely not a religion that is out of this world, but should be a positive activism. Catholicism not only has strict precepts and precise organizations, but also has a fearless fighting view of life. Ordinary priests can certainly live in poverty and be happy to die in remote rural areas. There are many such cases in China. As for the general believers, they can also defend themselves at all times and fight at all moments, taking benevolence as the starting point, helping others as happiness, and taking impartiality and peace as the standard, so as to seek welfare for the poor people. This is what is called the "Catholic spirit." Although the scope of discussion at this conference is limited to education, we believe that the most important thing is to promote the Christian teachings of all nations and to be a demonstration of moral education.

### Director of Population Bureau Discusses the Preparations for the Census; Determined to Hold it as Scheduled in Two Years

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Ministry of Interior has decided to hold the first national census in Chinese history in 1950. Bao Huiseng, Director of the Population Bureau, today gave reporters a detailed account of the significance and preparations for this pioneering undertaking. Bao first pointed out that the census is a type of basic national survey, which is used to remedy the defects of inconsistent periods and inaccurate books in household registration and household registration. The reason for selecting 1950 to hold it is to seek conformity with the suggestions of the International Statistical Association and the United Nations Population Commission to hold the World Population Census in the year ending in zero in the Western calendar (1950 in the Republic of China), so that it is more valuable in terms of academic and practical use.

Bao also said that the census requires about 850,000 people. The Ministry of Interior has trained more than 300,000 staff at all levels of household administration, and is continuing to train them, hoping that there will be no shortage of manpower within two years, that is, before the census.

Although the census requires a large amount of funds, judging from the past examples of Japan and India, the percentage of the total amount of state expenditure is still small, and the three types of expenses for preparation, investigation, and statistics are not spent in the same year, so raising funds is not too difficult.

Regarding the regulations for the census form, Bao believes that it should be as simple as possible, and only the most basic matters should be investigated. The items listed in the table drafted by the Ministry of Interior only include name, title, gender, age, native place, marital status, education level, and whether they have lived in the county or city for more than six months. Border provinces will add items such as ethnicity, language, and religion. He pointed out that this is only a proposal, and opinions from domestic experts will still be adopted at any time for additions and deletions.

Regarding the sorting out of the first census data in the future, Bao believes that the principle should be to adopt the machine method, but the strip paper (ie card) method may also be adopted. The decision will be made after weighing the objective situation next year, because based on the current wages, prices, and exchange rates, machine sorting is still more cost-effective than the strip paper method.

The Population Bureau's determination to hold the census as scheduled can also be seen in Bao's speech. When answering the reporter's question about whether the census will still be held if the military and financial situation of suppressing bandits cannot be as ideal as expected at that time, he said in a firm tone: The Population Bureau has also considered the method of implementing the census based on the worst situation, that is, even if the bandit disturbances are not quelled and the finances are difficult, the national census can still be held, but the method should be changed, that is, the population in the bandit areas will be replaced by precise estimates instead of the census, and the calculations will be based on historical data and sample surveys. If there are financial difficulties, food or taxes can be implemented in areas where household registration has been processed, so as to use the funds that have been earmarked to handle the census in areas where there is no household registration. If it is still insufficient, it is expected that the difference is limited, and the national treasury can still allocate funds.

### Taiwan Sugar Industry Revival

35 Factories Intensify Production; Producing More Than 6,000 Metric Tons Per Day

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 15th] Taiwan Province used to have a very rich sugar production. At the beginning of the recovery, the factories were severely damaged, and the sugar industry declined. At this third sugar-making period after the restoration, it is believed to be attracting attention from all parties. It is reported that of the 36 sugar factories under the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, except for the Hengchun factory, which has been temporarily postponed for repairs, the remaining 35 sugar factories have started work one after another. When reporters inspected these factories, they saw towering chimneys and black smoke like clouds. Farmers were busy harvesting in the fields, and trains and trucks transporting sugarcane were constantly on the road, showing a scene of new prosperity, which was not the desolate situation of two years ago. These 35 sugar factories can crush 59,000 metric tons of sugarcane every day, which can produce more than 6,000 metric tons of sugar. By the end of April, nearly 60,000 hectares of raw material sugarcane will be completely crushed, and it is expected to produce about 300,000 metric tons of sugar, an increase of ten times compared with the previous year. In the future, sugar prices will generally fall, so the main plan for competition in the international market is to reduce production costs. It is heard that Taiwan Sugar Corporation is working hard to improve, so as to open up a large outlet for Taiwan sugar.

### Communist Bandits, Under Foreign Instructions, Attempt to Establish a Puppet Organization in the Northeast, Remarks of Bandit Commander Cheng Yaode After Defecting

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th] Cheng Yaode, commander of the Fourth Military Sub-district of the Communist Bandit's Yu-Su-Wan Military Region, has specially defected to the National Army, pledging allegiance to the Central Government. According to his remarks to reporters, "The Communist Chinese Central Committee attempted to establish a puppet central government, initially choosing to attack Taiyuan to organize their puppet government. Later, under instructions from their foreign masters, they changed to attacking Changchun or Shenyang in the Northeast. Therefore, the Communist bandits in the Northeast, with the assistance of a certain party, are launching several offensives at all costs to have alien races occupy Changchun or Shenyang and establish a attached puppet organization." Cheng continued, "The Communist bandits' current widespread roaming, their important attempt is the mountain interior line combat, with Liu Bocheng fleeing south to the Dabie Mountains and Tongbai Mountains to establish a 'New Liberated Area' north of the Yangtze River. The Chen Yi bandit group is establishing a 'New Liberated Area' north of the Huai River and south of the Yellow River. Once the foundations of their occupied areas are solid, they will prepare to cross the Yangtze River and advance to the areas east and west of the Yuehan Railway. The Jiangbei area they leave behind will be taken over by Peng Dehuai and Nie Rongzhen. The Lin Biao troops in the Northeast will be escorted into the Guan and areas north of the Yellow River, all adopting a gradual advancement approach. The bandit units of Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, and Chen Geng have different organizational structures, uneven economic distribution, and depleted food and ammunition supplies. Conflicts of interest often arise within the bandit ranks, leading to friction. There is war-weariness within the Communist bandit ranks, and the number of suicides is increasing daily. They have lost their homes and families, and they have witnessed the Communist bandits' various inhumane atrocities, affecting innocent civilians. The so-called 'liberation,' 'struggle,' and 'democracy,' and their beautiful lies, are causing China's great rivers and mountains to be ruined. Therefore, they are all wandering astray, resulting in tragic suicides due to anger and grief. If the government can promote leniency and provide a path to self-renewal in the areas where the bandits roam, and treat the prisoners well, it can disintegrate the Communist bandits faster than military action." Finally, he said, "The 'Defecting General' Gao Shuxun's bandit unit was completely eliminated by Liu Bocheng in northern Changzhi on July 14 last year. The fate of Gao Shuxun himself is unknown. The Communist bandits strictly prohibit the publication of this news."

Communist Bandit Cadre Defects and Reveals Darkness in Bandit Areas

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] Dong Shaocheng, who served as a cadre working in the Communist Bandit ranks for over four years, defected to the National Army in eastern Hebei, revealing the darkness in the bandit areas, stating: "Intellectuals suffer the most control in the bandit areas. The Communist bandits say that intellectuals have a strong petty bourgeois consciousness, are prone to compromise, and have complex and divergent thoughts. If they express themselves actively, they are called 'petty bourgeois madness'; if they express themselves rigidly, they are accused of 'disappointment and passive intent at work.' Intellectuals can only be echoing insects who blindly praise." Live burial is still practiced in the bandit areas. According to a report by Liang Tianchou, the district chief of Lianhe County, he buried over 80 people alive in one month. The so-called land reform is nothing more than intensifying the contradictions among the farmers. On the one hand, the landowners are forced to dedicate their land, and on the other hand, small farmers are called landlords, feigning enlightenment. After the farmers have divided the land, they are told that they 'must fight to defend the fruits of victory' and are forced to 'join the army.' After several 'expansions of the army,' the youth men have almost all disappeared from the villages in the bandit areas."

Machines Plundered from Northeast by Soviets Transferred to Communist Bandits

[United Press, This City Dispatch] According to neutral people who retreated from Shenyang on the 15th, "The industrial equipment plundered from Northeast China by the Soviets has now been returned to the Communist army's Harbin." This person is a foreigner and is currently en route to Hong Kong. He stated, "According to reliable sources, before he left Shenyang, the Soviets had shipped back to Harbin on ships the factory machinery that was taken away when Japan surrendered. Most of the machinery was still in its original packaging, but the number is unknown." He also pointed out that a recent Communist Chinese communique stated that there are 2,600 kilometers of railways under their control that are open to traffic. If this news is true, it exceeds the railways occupied by the National Army in the Northeast.

### Three Powers Determined to Disregard Soviet Protest, London Conference Held as Scheduled, "German State Bank" Established in British and American Zones

[United Press, London, 14th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that the Soviet Union has sent a note to Britain protesting the upcoming three-power conference in London on the German issue. The Soviet government believes that this conference violates the Potsdam Agreement and declared that the Soviet Union would not recognize any German resolutions decided at this conference. The spokesman also said that the Soviet position would not affect the planning of the meeting, as the conference was well prepared and would proceed as planned. The United States, Britain, and France have agreed on the first item on the agenda, which is to consider the requests from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to participate in the meeting.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] State Department officials said that the Soviet Union has sent a strong note to the United States protesting the upcoming German conference to be held by the United States, Britain, and France. It is expected that the Soviet note can be rejected before the London conference. The note was presented to Deputy Secretary of State Lovett yesterday by Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin, and its content is generally the same as the one submitted by the Soviet Union to the British Foreign Office. Officials here believe that the Soviet protest is only a "routine" matter, as the Soviet Union has previously protested the three powers' meeting to discuss the German issue, but without result.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 15th] The military governors of the British and American combined zones in Germany jointly issued a notice announcing the establishment of the "German State Bank," which has the right to issue banknotes and exercise most of the powers previously exercised by the Deutsche Bank. The British and American military governors also announced the establishment of the Allied Banking Commission, which will exercise general supervision over the "German State Bank." The bank is located in Frankfurt and is the only institution in the jurisdiction of its subordinate state banks that issues banknotes. Its nature is equivalent to the Federal Reserve Bank of the state banks, supporting the state banks and maintaining the uniformity of the state banks' policies. The "German State Bank" will also serve as the clearing center for its subordinate state banks and may, in accordance with normal procedures, engage with foreign central banks.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 14th] There is hope here that France will be able to join the "German State Bank" established today after the three-power meeting in London, which is scheduled to begin on the 19th. The itinerary will be discussed in detail by the British and French sides, but a complete agreement has not been reached.

### No Signs of Relaxation in Soviet Policy, US-Soviet "Cold War" to Reach Peak This Spring, Both Sides Deny Berlin Secret Talks

[United Press, Washington, 15th] US government officials today expressed disbelief in reports that Soviet foreign policy showed signs of softening. Officials unanimously agreed that there was no evidence to prove that the Soviet Union was genuinely inclined to take a more cooperative approach with the United States and Western countries. One official pointed out that only two days ago, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin submitted a strong protest to the State Department against the upcoming conference in London by the United States, Britain, and France to discuss western Germany. The speculation arose because of a report that senior US and Soviet officials held an informal meeting in Berlin a few days ago and discussed ending the "Cold War."

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The American diplomatic community expects US-Soviet relations to worsen in the next three to six months, after which they may improve. Some people around Secretary of State Marshall said that there is hope for a relaxation of the dispute between East and West within a year. This spring is indeed a critical time, and the central issue of the crisis is the Marshall Plan. If Europe remains in a state of great instability in the future, the Soviet Union will continue to try to gain control of the entire continent, and the United States will encourage European countries to resist all threats from Soviet communism.

[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 15th] The Soviet Information Bureau here denied rumors that a secret meeting was initiated by the Soviets in Berlin between Marshal Sokolovsky and Murphy, the political adviser to General Clay. The Soviet Information Bureau claimed that the news was "pure fabrication." General Clay, Commander of the US Forces in Germany, also issued a statement to the press denying the rumored US-Soviet talks.

### US-Soviet Talks Are Speaking Definitively

[Agence France-Presse, Swiss Capital, 14th] A correspondent for the Radical Democratic Party's newspaper "United Daily News" in Washington reported that "representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union have begun talks in Washington to discuss various long-pending issues between the two countries. All parties are now awaiting the results of these talks. It is said that the US is prepared to allow the Soviet Union to act freely in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, North Korea, and possibly even in Northeast China. But on the other hand, the US will make the following demands to the Soviet Union: (1) The US must be allowed to act freely in Greece; (2) The Soviet Union must stop aiding the Greek guerrilla leader Markos; (3) The Soviet Union must order the French and Italian Communist Parties to reduce their activities; (4) The Soviet Union must withdraw from East Germany.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] Well-informed sources here today denied reports that President Truman is trying to resolve the various issues between the US and the Soviet Union. It is said that "military issues between the US and the Soviet Union are currently being discussed by the Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in Germany and the Soviet side. The US has not formally taken action to negotiate with the Soviet Union, nor does the US intend to demand that the Soviet Union withdraw from Germany. If the Soviet Union can truly stop exerting pressure on Greece and the Middle East, and resolve the German issue in good faith, and no longer incite the French and Italian Communist Parties to disrupt the politics and economy of their own countries, then the US believes that it is still possible for it to achieve a de facto peace with the Soviet Union. The US does not want to seek the same spheres of influence in the countries under the Soviet sphere of influence. On the contrary, the US is hoping that the Soviet Union can promote the freedom of the people in these countries. In view of the current situation, the US may not be able to reach an understanding immediately, but due to the arrival of the new Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin, the US will be able to handle negotiations with the Soviet side more easily. American leaders have always hoped that the US and the Soviet Union can compromise and move closer."

### Foreign Ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia Discuss German Issues

[Reuters, Prague, 14th] It is reported that the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia are scheduled to meet here on Thursday to discuss the future of Germany. According to observers here, the neighbors of Germany are deeply surprised by the recent developments in Germany. Poland is most afraid of the finality of Germany's eastern frontier and the Germans who have been moved from Poland to Germany, who may establish military groups and engage in sabotage activities in Poland. According to an official announcement here, the meeting of the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia will discuss common interests regarding the German issue, and it is declared that this meeting should not be considered to have been initiated by a strong power in the East.

### Truman Orders Investigation into Impact of Sharp Drop in US Prices

Preparing to Report to the Nation

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] President Truman has ordered his Council of Economic Advisers to investigate the recent sharp drop in commodity and securities markets and to estimate its impact. After the investigation, the President will again issue a report to the nation on the economic situation.

### Military and Police Ordered to Mobilize, Belgian Labor Strike Serious

[United Press, Brussels, 14th] The strike wave has spread throughout the country. On the night of the 14th, all police in the capital and half of the garrison were ordered to be on alert. Officials refused to comment on the rumors of military and police being on alert, but some actions of the police and military camps proved that the rumors were true. The armory of the Gendarmerie Headquarters has been opened, and guards are stationed. A battalion of paratroopers in the suburbs and the capital's police have been ordered to be on alert. The military and police have been ordered to be stationed in case of emergency. Electricity workers, coal miners, and public utility employees have all joined the strike.

### British Commonwealth United to Resist Communism

Churchill Delivers Broadcast Speech

They also adopt a consistent position on the general principles of foreign policy.

### Eisenhower Issues Warning: U.S. Must Prepare for Contingencies; Last Report During Military Service Published

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] General Eisenhower, who retired a week ago to become President of Columbia University, had his report from his time as Chief of Staff of the Army released today by Secretary of the Army Royal.  It warned the United States that it must prepare to deal with attacks in the atomic age. He believes that until all nations have agreed to disarm, the United States must be prepared to repel such attacks. However, he also expressed hope that lasting peace can be established through the United Nations.

This report covers the entire period of U.S. military policy from November 19, 1945, when he succeeded Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army, until his recent retirement. General Eisenhower believes that the current U.S. Army is insufficient to repel atomic attacks, that disarmament has reached a dangerous level and cannot be further reduced. To cope with the threat of atomic attacks, the United States must establish various facilities to defend the American continent and its surrounding bases, and immediately launch retaliatory counter-attacks to defeat the enemy's main force and severely damage their base, in order to achieve peace between the enemy and ourselves. The tragedy of the present era is that the war has just ended, and ideological conflicts have arisen again. Our Western European allies are in dire straits, and some are threatened by militarized political parties whose main purpose is to create chaos in order to achieve the goals of a certain foreign ideology. If these countries abandon their struggle for freedom and become victims of totalitarianism, the security of the United States will also be in danger.

### Mobilizing 20,000 German Laborers: Soviets Exploit Uranium Ores

[Central News Agency, Frankfurt, 14th, United Press] According to reports from the Soviet Union, Soviet authorities have at least 20,000 specially selected German laborers working in the uranium mines in Silesia, which belongs to Poland. Refugees who have fled from the Soviet-occupied zone say that mining work began about a week ago. According to reliable sources, the German laborers have excellent food and generous pay.

### Soviets Accuse Britain and France of Engaging in Duplicitous Diplomacy

Soviets Launch Propaganda Offensive

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 14th, United Press] The Soviet government claimed tonight that in the months before the outbreak of World War II, Britain and France engaged in duplicitous tactics, on the one hand negotiating with the Soviet Union for a defensive alliance against aggressors, but at the same time attempting to reach a compromise with Germany. The Soviet Union, aware of the strategies of Britain and France at the time, negotiated a non-aggression pact with Germany in order to protect itself and maintain peace in Europe. The above accusations made by the Soviet Union are in a statement issued by the Soviet government's Information Bureau.

### Tojo Unable to Escape Execution: Busily Writing Memoirs

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th, United Press] Tojo expects the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to sentence him to death. The verdict is expected on May 1st. Tojo is currently busy writing in prison, and most Japanese believe that this book is likely a memoir, to be published after his execution to support his family. General observers believe that Tojo will be sentenced to death, but some defendants may receive lighter sentences.

### Diet to Decide on Prime Minister Today: Intense Activities by Japanese Parties; Democratic and National Cooperative Parties Insist on Ashida as Prime Minister

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th]  Because the four-party secretary-general meeting on the 14th decided to nominate the next prime minister and vote on it at the House of Representatives Steering Committee on the 16th, intense activities unfolded from the evening of the 14th. Judging from the trend, the Democratic Party and the National Cooperative Party have adopted a united front, that is, they will insist on Ashida serving as prime minister even in the Diet on the 16th, and if it is not passed, they are resolutely prepared to become an opposition party. On the Liberal Party side, they have consistently advocated for Yoshida to be prime minister. As for the Socialist Party, regardless of whether Ashida or Yoshida becomes prime minister, there is a possibility of another split within the party, so they plan to nominate another candidate, but no candidate has been decided. Because Speaker Matsuoka hopes to nominate and vote in a formal way, and cannot decide on a prime minister, he is bound to implement actual nomination voting, so he telegraphed to members of the Diet in various places on the night of the 14th to return to Tokyo quickly.

An Example of Unyielding Spirit

In the summer of 1940, when Britain's situation at sea became increasingly critical, we had to make new decisions.

On August 4, the day before I left for White Sulphur Springs, British Ambassador Lord Lothian came to see me and expressed his government's "urgent desire" to purchase some older destroyers from us. He said Britain needed them to get through what he considered its "present emergency."

During my attendance at the Havana Conference, the President had been talking with Lothian and communicating by telegram with Prime Minister Churchill on this subject and on the question of Britain possibly ceding or leasing to us some of its bases in the Western Hemisphere. The idea of selling or leasing destroyers was first mooted by French Prime Minister Reynaud on May 14—only four days after the German invasion of France—and seconded by Mr. Churchill the next day.

At that time, the President was opposed to the suggestion.

But everything is relative. After the collapse of France greatly increased our danger, we were more inclined to agree to cede our aging destroyers, if the losses to our national defense caused by the cession could be compensated for in other ways, such as obtaining new bases. The Navy had long hoped to obtain more bases along the Atlantic. We also felt that since our destroyers could strengthen the British Navy, it would in fact increase a layer of protection for ourselves, because the British fleet stood between the Axis countries bent on conquest and us. Moreover, on June 28, 1940, Congress passed a bill proposed by the government, namely the National Defense Act, which allowed the sale of naval equipment, as long as the Director of Naval Operations confirmed that it was not needed for national defense.

When Lothian came to my office on August 4, I was able to fully understand Britain's danger as well as he could describe it. He said that Britain had lost five destroyers in the past week alone. He pointed out that destroyers were extremely important for dealing with submarine activity and other enemy activities in the English Channel, because in the English Channel, large warships could not fully exert their effectiveness.

He said that when I was in Havana, he had discussed this issue with the President and now hoped to put the current situation before me, in the hope that something could be achieved in the coming weeks. He also said that Britain would be willing to let us use naval and air base facilities on some British islands near Central and South America and in Bermuda, as well as an air base in Newfoundland.

I first explained to Lothian that such conveniences would of course benefit all the republics of the Americas. I said, "In accordance with the understanding reached at the Havana Conference and other previous meetings, the United States must cooperate with other American republics if it takes any action."

On the same day, I sent the President a memorandum on the sale of warships and auxiliary vessels, including a draft bill for submission to Congress, so that it could specifically approve the sale. When discussing this draft bill with the President, we both believed that there might be two undesirable aspects to submitting this bill to Congress: one was that it would arouse considerable opposition from isolationists; the other was that it might take several weeks of discussion before it could be passed.

This was the situation when I left Washington. During my three weeks of rest at White Sulphur Springs, I had a private telephone line in my apartment and received a large amount of mail from the Senate every day, so I was closely watching and participating in the destroyer-base negotiations then being handled by the President and Welles. On August 23, a few hours after I returned to Washington, I went to the White House to attend a cabinet meeting.

It was there that the President said to me, "Our negotiations with Britain on bases and destroyers have stalled. Please see if you can find a solution."

When I discussed the issue of bases with the President, I found that he personally had an amazing knowledge of almost all of these bases. He had either cruised, or swam, or fished in these harbors. He knew how deep, how wide, and how many ships they could accommodate.

He also knew the poverty of the people on some of the islands, so he was unwilling to take on the responsibility of governing these people. Therefore, during my absence from Washington, he had changed his original straightforward proposal to purchase the bases, and wanted to lease them for ninety-nine years. I originally favored straightforward cession, but now I was willing to agree to the leasing method.

So I set about handling the negotiations, determined to complete them as soon as possible.

The next day, when I was reviewing the progress of the negotiations, the White House informed me that the British Ambassador had an appointment with the President on Sunday evening and that Mr. Roosevelt wanted me to attend.

Lothian came to see me fairly early on Sunday afternoon, so we could review the general situation before he spoke with the President that evening. He raised several objections to the proposal given to him by Welles, in his capacity as Acting Secretary of State, on August 19. He said that his government did not like the provision in the American proposal that we had the absolute right to determine and choose the bases we needed, while the British side had no opportunity to speak. His government opposed the method of exchanging destroyers for bases in the proposal, and hoped to exchange them in the form of gifts.

The reason why the latter point became difficult was that Mr. Churchill had clearly spoken of lending bases directly in the form of gifts in a speech on August 20. He did not mention destroyers at all. The Prime Minister felt that exchanging gifts would create a sense of cooperation on both sides of the Atlantic better than haggling over the exchange. He also said that the British public would not scrutinize gifts as closely as exchanges, and would not think it worthwhile for Britain to lend valuable bases in exchange for fifty old destroyers.

But we also had difficulties on our side. Attorney General Jackson believed that the President, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces, had the legal right to sell destroyers to Britain. But if the President did so without special authorization from Congress, he should be able to satisfy Congress by some means, namely that after handing over the destroyers, we could obtain various conveniences in terms of bases, and their value would obviously give us greater security than retaining these fifty destroyers.

More importantly, the President had no power to donate government property to other countries in the form of gifts. I told Lothian this.

That night, I met Lothian at the White House. As we sat waiting for our appointment with the President, I reiterated to him that the President had no power to give away public property.

But when the President received us, I was surprised that Lothian seemed to ignore what I said about the President not being legally able to give public property as a gift, and still put forward the British proposal.

After Lothian finished presenting his arguments, I said for the third time to the Ambassador and for the first time to the President that the President had no power to give away public property as a gift to any government or individual. Mr. Roosevelt immediately agreed with me.

So the President handed the matter over to me, letting Lothian and I work out a solution.

The next morning, I invited State Department legal advisor Hackworth and Justice Department Judge Thompson to my office to find a way to reach a compromise. After a brief discussion, Hackworth suddenly suggested that there could ultimately be a compromise between Churchill's hoped-for exchange of gifts and the legal position of our President that he could not give up the destroyers without obtaining something in exchange.

Since the British had not specifically stated which bases they wanted to lend to us, why not divide them into two categories? The first category would include the bases in Newfoundland and Bermuda. These Britain could lend to us in the form of straightforward gifts. The second category would include the bases around the Caribbean Sea. Because they are close to the Panama Canal, they are more valuable to us strategically. These could be lent to us in exchange for fifty destroyers.

I immediately realized that this was the formula I was looking for.

So we set about redrafting the proposal?

That afternoon, Hackworth and Thompson went to see the President, who agreed to this compromise.

In the draft proposal, the beginning was a guarantee from the British government, which said that if British warships could not approach the territorial waters of the British Isles, "the British fleet will never surrender or scuttle, but will be sent to other ports of the Empire to continue defending the Empire."

Churchill had offered this guarantee in a speech to Parliament on June 4, but I wanted it formally repeated for the sake of transferring the destroyers to Britain.

On August 27, Lothian sent me a very long telegram from Churchill to the President. Churchill signed it himself as "Former Naval Person," agreeing to the earlier proposal made by Lothian, which was to lend British bases in the form of straightforward gifts, which was unacceptable to us.

Churchill was also prepared to guarantee that the British fleet would never be scuttled or surrendered, but argued that it should be done in the form of an exchange of letters between Lothian and me.

He used his usual unyielding spirit, declaring that he did not want the exchange of letters to be made public, because "I think it is much more likely that the German government will cause its fleet or the remnants of its fleet to surrender or scuttle. They have lightly used this method, as you know. You will remember that in a private telegram I gave you a few months ago, I said that if we did this, it would be a cowardly act. Everyone among us thinks so."

Churchill opposed publicizing this guarantee, which he had already stated in a telegram to the President on August 15, when he said: "...Please remember that from our point of view, and perhaps from yours, how harmful it is to allow an impression to grow that we consider the conquest of the British Isles and their bases is not an impossible eventuality. The spirit of our people is excellent."

After Lothian telegraphed the location of the bases that the President had in mind to London, Churchill immediately agreed and also added Anticosti Island in the Caribbean Sea at no cost, saying that this island could be used as a seaplane base.

On that hot evening of August 27, Lothian, Minister Crooks, and Admiral Stark all came to my apartment around 10:30, finding me wearing loose shirts and trousers. The four of us read the draft for more than an hour. Lothian initially made a few suggestions for amendments, but later seemed quite satisfied and said that he would send the content to the government.

At 7:00 p.m. on the night of August 29, Lothian came to my apartment and left me the counter-proposal made by his government. We made slight modifications to the original text, and then called Lothian, who came to my apartment again at 10:30. He agreed to the modifications we had made.

The next day, August 30, I notified the President, who was then at Hyde Park, of the modifications by telephone, and immediately obtained his approval.

Lothian spent the weekend in Boston and returned to Washington on Monday afternoon (September 2), coming to my apartment at 7:00 p.m. that evening. We signed and exchanged notes there, confirming the destroyer-base deal.

Lothian also gave me his reply to a memorandum I had given him earlier, which asked him to guarantee the disposal of the British fleet.

In his reply, Lothian said, "The Ambassador of His Majesty the King is instructed by the Prime Minister to inform Mr. Hull, the Secretary of State, that this statement does indeed represent the established policy of His Majesty's Government. But Mr. Churchill must point out that this hypothetical eventuality is more likely to happen to the German fleet or its remnants than to the British fleet."

The last sentence was added by Churchill himself.

At this point, the most important negotiation in our history was declared over in a week.

### Air Transport Drug Trafficking Case Is Complex: Involves Financial Institutions in Corruption; 24 Key Suspects Escorted to the Capital Are Mostly People of Status; Expected that Four Kunming Suspects Will Be Escorted Here Today

The Independent 3rd Battalion of the Shanghai Gendarmerie and Special High Group personnel, together with the Kunming Gendarmerie, cracked down on a large-scale Shanghai-Kunming air transport drug trafficking organization in January of this year, arresting a total of 28 key suspects, including retired general-level officers, active-duty soldiers, central committee members of political parties, university lecturers, and doctors of pharmacology. The circumstances are extremely shocking. After the case was cracked, it was reported to the highest authorities, and Chairman Chiang ordered that all suspects be escorted to the capital, where the Military Law Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense is conducting the interrogation. The investigators also discovered, from the clues obtained in cracking the case, that the China Native Products Company, operated by the main suspect Xie Jun, had committed the serious crime of providing resources to bandits. It was also learned that the company had colluded with a major central financial institution in Shanghai and illegally obtained huge loans. Regarding the above two points, the Gendarmerie is continuing to conduct a rigorous investigation, and a major corruption case may be exposed in the near future.

A Central News Agency reporter learned from responsible sources that the headquarters of the Shanghai-Kunming air transport drug trafficking organization, Xie Hsing Mei Company, is located on Nanhua Street in Kunming, with Chen Jimo as the manager. Yang Zhihe is responsible for contacting transportation, and the person responsible for air transport is named Wu Zikai, who is at large. Wu handed the drugs to Yang Xilin, who packed them on the plane. The drugs were hidden in the tires of a jeep, with each tire capable of hiding at least 160 taels of morphine. The person responsible for liaison in Shanghai was Zhang Haishan, the manager of the Qunyi Bookstore on Fuzhou Road. Zhang lived at a certain number in the Xingye Fang on Shanyin Road, which was also the hiding place for the drugs. The persons responsible for selling the drugs in Shanghai were Xie Jun and his brother Xie Songnian, who lived at 327 Haifang Road.

### Native Products Company Suspected of Aiding Bandits

Xie Jun is from Nanchang and has served as a major general deputy division commander and chief of staff. He is currently the chairman of the China Native Products Company, lives luxuriously, has extensive social connections, and interacts with famous figures in Shanghai. Gendarmerie personnel initially received a confidential report that the hemp purchased by the China Native Products Company was suspected of being used to aid bandits, and began an investigation, paying attention to Xie Jun's actions. They discovered that many of the people he interacted with were air force personnel, and many were visitors from Kunming of unknown identity. These Kunming travelers lived in the Oriental Hotel, Dongan Hotel, Yangtze Hotel, etc., acted suspiciously, and lived extravagantly. They frequently exchanged suspicious telegrams and letters with Kunming every day. Most of the sending and receiving locations for these telegrams and letters were Yang Zhihe in Kunming, so the Kunming Gendarmerie was notified to pay attention to and investigate Yang Zhihe.

### Following Clues to Track Down Drugs

On New Year's Day of this year, the Kunming Gendarmerie, based on the clues provided by Shanghai, discovered at Yang Zhihe's residence that an air force personnel (Wu Zikai) was carrying out a jeep tire, which was very suspicious. They also learned that the tire was transported to Shanghai by plane, and immediately telegraphed the Independent 3rd Battalion of the Shanghai Gendarmerie to send personnel to wait at the airport. Several people, including Yang Xilin, arrived that day. Yang had a mistress in Shanghai and was eager to visit her after arriving in Shanghai, so he handed the drugs over to Yu Qingci and Yang Xun (at large), who worked at the Jiangwan Airport, for transfer to Zhang Haishan, the liaison person in Shanghai. However, Yang Xun et al. demanded an extra 200 million yuan in transportation fees from Zhang Haishan, which Zhang refused to pay, so he did not receive the drugs. Yang Xun et al. then directly contacted Xie Songnian, who was responsible for sales. Xie Songnian borrowed a certain celebrity's car, drove to the place to pick up the drugs, and issued a bad check for 80 million yuan to Yang Xun, transporting the drugs to 327 Haifang Road. All of the above situations were fully detected by the Gendarmerie personnel.

### List of Suspects Escorted to the Capital

At 3:00 p.m. on January 9, Shanghai Gendarmerie personnel divided into eight groups and set out for 327 Haifang Road and other places, starting the work of arresting suspects. Within three hours, except for a few who were at large, a total of 59 suspects and suspects were arrested. Among them, 35 suspects have been released on bail, and 24 key suspects have been escorted to the capital for interrogation. The list is as follows: Xie Jun, Xie Songnian, Xie Chen Xiuying (Xie Jun's wife), Liu Rongbo (a university lecturer), Shi Ming (Doctor of Pharmacology from the University of Berlin, Germany), Xiao Shixian (a middle school teacher), Zhou Chunwei (a stationery merchant), Zhang Wenjie (Central Executive Committee member of the Zhonghe Party and Executive Committee member of the Yunnan Provincial Party Department of the Minshe Party), Xie Shenxing (a salt merchant), Jin Baoguang (a department store merchant), Li Yin'nan, Xia Yu, Zeng Qingjun, Yang Mingda (above are retired military personnel), Ma Jiwu, Zhang Tongbang, Yu Qifeng, Yu Qianci, Yang Xilin, Lu Chaoying, Chen Fubao, Cheng Kemeng, Huang Yuyang (some of the above are active duty military personnel), Zhang Haishan (manager of Qunyi Bookstore).

### Cipher Book Confirms Suspicions

Among those arrested at 327 Haifang Road were Xie Jun and his wife, Xie Songnian, Zeng Qingjun, Xiao Shixian, Shi Ming, Ma Jiwu, and others. At the time, Xie Jun was suffering from hematemesis and was lying in bed. The investigators first entered as electrical wire inspectors. During the search, no drugs were initially found, but later 160 taels of morphine and incoming and outgoing account books and a cipher book were found in the layered springs of Xie Jun's bed. The telegrams that had been intercepted before were translated using the cipher book, which were strong evidence of their transportation and sale of drugs. The suspects could not deny it and surrendered.

After the drug traffickers in Shanghai were arrested, the Kunming Gendarmerie arrested the four main suspects, Chen Jimo, Yang Zhihe, Wu Yongqing, and Tang Zibin, on January 11. It was originally scheduled to escort them to Shanghai by plane on the 15th for transfer to Nanjing for joint trial, but the plane did not take off on the 15th due to bad weather. It is expected that they will be escorted to Shanghai today.

### Travelers Returning to Shanghai from Various Locations: Train Lines Overcrowded

(Report from Our Newspaper) At the end of the lunar year, travelers from various places in Shanghai returned to their hometowns to celebrate the New Year. Now that the New Year has passed, the number of passengers arriving in Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines has become overcrowded again. The Shanghai North Railway Station has been receiving telegrams from major stations along the two lines for days, stating that each train has hundreds of passengers who cannot board despite having tickets. To facilitate travelers, the railway bureau has allowed them to board the next train.

### Heavy Fog in Beijing and Shanghai: Navigation Obstructed

According to a report from the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, on the 15th, due to the intrusion of a southwest warm current into the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, especially the Jiangnan area, heavy fog occurred in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, affecting air and sea transportation. All incoming and outgoing ships were suspended. China Central Airlines flights from Ping, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places to Shanghai were all canceled.

Passengers would be carried back to Shanghai after the weather in the city improved. It is said that all flights from various places to Beijing have also been temporarily suspended.

### Major Tragedy on the First Day of the New Year: Sixteen People Burned to Death on Fuyou Road; A Careless Family of Over Thirty People Cooking Dim Sum Causes the Disaster

(Report from Our Newspaper) The houses along the Guanyinge Street section of Fuyou Road, east of the City God Temple in the Nanshi district, are all old, single-story, Western-style urban houses. Most of the residents are laborers. Fang Xia Youxiang, a 44-year-old woman from Ningbo, was the second landlord of Room 2 on the second floor of No. 73. She lived in the two-story building with her son-in-law, Hu Asi (35 years old, from Zhejiang, dealing in American goods), Hu's wife, Xiao Mao (25 years old), Hu's son, Hongbao, and Hu's daughter, Cuizhen (9 years old). The second floor attic was rented to Yuan Quanfa, a cook at a dining hall, and his family of five: his wife, Yuan Xingyue, his daughter, Yuan Guizhen (3 years old), his youngest daughter, Acui, who was only a few months old, and a fostered infant, one year old. The third floor attic was rented to a group of single men, commonly known as "shared bed renters," numbering more than ten people. Each person paid a monthly rent of 30,000 yuan. Most of these people were dockworkers.

Hu Asi hosted gambling gatherings every night, profiting from commissions. The players were all tenants from the third floor. Yesterday morning, the gambling continued until about 4 a.m. before breaking up. Later, Hu lit a kerosene stove to cook dim sum. Beside it was a large package of American matches and a can of kerosene. Due to carelessness, after falling asleep, sparks fell down and spread, eventually causing the flames to break through the roof. It was 6 a.m. The North District Fire Brigade was informed and dispatched all firefighters led by Director Li Zhiliang to rush to the scene to put out the fire. At the same time, the Xin Kaihe Fire Brigade and fire brigades from the Western District and Songshan District also rushed to the scene to provide assistance. However, due to the narrow streets, fire trucks could not reach directly and had to connect hoses to fight the fire. By this time, the fire was raging, and only half of the more than thirty people living inside escaped. Firefighters worked hard to control the fire, and only the facade of the adjacent No. 71 building was affected.

After receiving the report, Shen, the chief of the City God Temple Police Sub-bureau, ordered Zhou Nan, the chief of the criminal investigation section, to lead section members Fan Boxiong, officers Sun Ziqiang, Wang Wenjie, Hong Yucheng, and several uniformed police officers to the fire scene to maintain order. After more than two hours, the fire was completely extinguished. Hu Asi, the source of the fire, was taken to the police station by police officers to inquire about the cause of the fire. His wife, Hu Fang, suffered burns on her left hand and face and was sent to the hospital for treatment. More than ten men and women from upstairs and downstairs who jumped out of the building to escape were mostly naked and in a state of great disarray. Fortunately, none of them were injured.

Subsequently, firefighters began to excavate and found a total of sixteen male and female corpses in four separate incidents. They were identified as: Fang Xia Youxiang, the second landlord; Hongbao, his son; Hu Cuizhen, his niece; Chen Rongsheng (34 years old, from Yangzhou, laborer); Shi Chungui (48 years old, from Ningbo, laborer); Xiao Pudong (laborer); Yuan Quanfa; Lao He; Wang Aying (25 years old); Yuan Guizhen; Yuan Xingyue; Yuan Acui; Fang Wenqing (15 years old); Dong Zili; Xu Jidao; and Yuan's one-year-old child. All were charred beyond recognition, a tragic sight. One male corpse and two children's corpses were dismembered, making the scene even more horrific. The bodies were then transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall and placed in a room, pending inspection by the District Procuratorate this morning before being placed in coffins.

### Grand Gathering at Lake Society: Commemorating Drama Festival; Pan Gongzhan Urges the Drama Circle to Research and Improve, to Achieve Purification and Beautification of Life; Ninety-Six Film Practitioners Receive Medals

(Report from Our Newspaper) Yesterday was the 37th National Drama Festival. The Shanghai Municipal Culture Movement Committee, together with people from the drama circle, held a grand commemorative meeting at the Lake Society Auditorium at 11:00 a.m. Those who attended included Luo Xuelian, Zheng Junli, Ma Xu Weibang, Xu Xinfu, Meng Junmou, Xia Yunhu, Ren Zongde, Li Dacen, Bai Yang, Shangguan Yunzhu, Yan Gongshang, Wu Yin, Ouyang Hongying, Qin Xiaolong, and others from the film industry; Xiong Foxi, a representative from the drama circle; Zhou Xinfang, a representative from the Peking opera circle; Dong Tianmin, a representative from the performing arts association; Yang Binkui, a representative from the Pingtan Research Association; and representatives from the Chang Xiwen Opera Research Association, Shanghai Opera Research Association, Su Tan Research Association, Jianghuai Opera Association, Yue Opera Workers' Union, Comic Opera Research Association, Drama Research Association, Actors' Union, Weiyang Opera Research Association, Xianyu Opera Troupe, Technical Society, and Juan Opera Research Association, totaling about 500 people. Guizhou Road was bustling with traffic, and the Lake Society inside and outside was filled with beautifully dressed people. It was truly a grand gathering in the drama circle this year. Most of the people in the drama circle who attended the meeting were meeting for the first time after the lunar new year, so there was a lot of "Congratulations" being said in the venue, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

After the meeting began, Pan Gongzhan, the chairman of the Culture Movement Committee, gave a speech, stating that drama is a comprehensive art that integrates all truth, goodness, and beauty, and it bears a very important mission. In the past, the drama circle has been sticking to its position, working hard on research, and has already shown excellent results in all aspects. However, drama should not be satisfied with simply being realistic, touching, or reflecting life, but should aim to achieve the highest goals of purifying life and beautifying life. Especially in Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather and various dramas are performed, the direct impact on the education of citizens is quite large. Therefore, he hoped that drama workers would not only fully utilize their past seriousness, loyalty, and perseverance towards drama and life, but also maintain unity, contact and observe, research and improve, so that drama can fulfill its function and follow the times to carry forward and develop. At the end of his speech, Pan expressed his renewed gratitude to the Peking opera circle for their charity performance in the previous year to donate funds to the Culture Movement Zhongzheng Culture Award.

Veteran of the Theater World Wins Applause from the Entire Audience

Then, Xiong Foxi, on behalf of the drama circle, gave a speech, saying that drama has an educational mission, but our country spends a lot of money on education, and has not heard of using extra resources to cultivate drama workers. He believes that everyone cannot leave the word "study" throughout their lives, and the places for learning, in addition to schools, are the large society. However, those who know the society most clearly and intimately are the theaters. Drama performances have joy, anger, sadness, and happiness, but these joys, angers, sadnesses, and happinesses contain infinite truths of life. He advocates that only "imparting education through drama" is the ideal way out for the drama circle and the education circle in the future, so he calls on drama workers to enrich themselves, study skills, endure hardships, and jointly seek the revival of Chinese drama. Xiong has devoted himself to the drama movement for decades, and is strong in his old age. He is one of the veterans of today's theater world. Yesterday, in his long beard, he expressed his sincere hopes to the entire drama circle, and his enthusiasm won applause from the entire audience.

Then, Zhou Xinfang gave a speech, saying that drama is permanent, but the life of actors is limited. For the sake of the next generation, the drama circle should change its interest in supporting actors to reforming and enriching drama. He said that in recent years, the film industry has developed, which has had a great impact on Peking opera. Many Peking opera theaters in the city have recently been converted into cinemas, so Peking opera actors have gone to Taiwan, the Philippines, and other places to perform and make a living. If this continues, the unemployment problem of Peking opera practitioners may gradually become serious. Therefore, he called on Peking opera workers to adopt modern consciousness and equipment, and work hard to improve in order to keep up with the times, so as not to become a sacrifice in the entire drama.

### Observation Performance to Be Held Today

Then, Wang Xiaoyu, on behalf of the social elite, Luo Xuelian, on behalf of the film industry, Dong Tianmin, on behalf of the performing arts industry, and finally Tan Yimin, the director of the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee, gave speeches, hoping that drama work would be in line with the era's mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Finally, Yu Wen, the deputy chairman of the Culture Movement Committee, reported on the preparations and program procedures for the observation performance celebrating this year's Drama Festival. The observation performance is scheduled to begin at 11:00 a.m. today and end at 6:00 p.m. At that time, actors of various dramas or other technologies will show their skills, and it is expected that it will be an unprecedented event.

Award Ceremony

Finally, Pan Gongzhan presided over the award ceremony for the 36th Zhongzheng Culture Award-winning films of the Culture Movement Association. In addition to each of the ten film production companies receiving a large group medal, the directors, actors, set designers, and sound engineers of each film received a small medal. The award-winning personnel for each film included: "The Spring River Flows East" (15 people), "Skirt Wind" (8 people), "Mother and Son" (13 people), "On the Songhua River" (9 people), "The End of Spring Dreams" (11 people), "Top Secret" (9 people), "Where is the Jade Beauty" (9 people), "Distant Love" (11 people), "Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon" (8 people), and "China's Resistance" (3 people), totaling 96 people.

### Communist Bandit Review: Year-End Struggle; Central News Agency Reveals Secrets

(Central News Agency) According to relevant sources, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Bandit has secretly ordered underground cadres at all levels to report in detail the process of the labor and student movement struggles before the Lunar New Year of 1947, in order to summarize and review the gains and losses. At the same time, it made the following brief comments on the year-end struggle: "We especially emphasized that the 'Kowloon Incident Student Joint Demonstration', the 'January 28 Tongji Student Tide', the 'Unprecedented Joint Hunger Strike of the Wool Textile Industry', and the 'Dance Industry Crowd Demanding Lifting of the Ban and Riot' in the year-end struggle were all able to follow our instructions and seize the opportunity to launch anti-Chiang and anti-American movements to raise the masses' struggle mood. The government was in a hurry and mobilized a large number of military and police services, and did not hesitate to use force to create bloody tragedies to suppress them, so that its false democracy and dictatorial ferocious faces were fully exposed to the broad masses of the people. This point has been quite successful. However, we failed to coordinate the labor and student movements, and failed to raise the struggle to the stage of civil unrest as much as possible. What deserves our attention even more is that the year-end struggle failed to affect the workers in the public utilities of important units. We believe that this is a major shortcoming in the leadership of comrades at all levels, and we need to be vigilant and review it in order to welcome the arrival of a new revolutionary upsurge."

### Special Donations for Relief to Be Held: Decision to Establish a Fundraising Association

(Report from Our Newspaper) Since the central government decided to hold special donations for relief, the city has decided to establish a fundraising committee for special donations for relief, with Mayor Wu serving as the chairman, Pan Gongzhan and Du Yuesheng as the vice chairmen. According to Shen Zonglian, the secretary-general of the municipal government, the date of establishment of the special donation fundraising committee may be around the end of this month. At a time when property registration has not yet been held, it is quite difficult to promote fundraising work. The fundraising targets may be to open a list of wealthy people in society, estimate the value of their property, and then rigidly stipulate the amount of their donations.

### Suppression Propaganda Team Still Mobilized in the Rain Yesterday

Yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and the Suppression Propaganda Team still mobilized in the rain as usual to carry out propaganda. The propaganda team of displaced students also cooperated in the action, which was very effective. A total of more than 100 team members were mobilized. The disguised propaganda team, led by Chen Songqing and Yong Dafu, took three propaganda trucks and set off from Fuming Village to tour the city, distributing leaflets and cartoons along the way, shouting slogans, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. They also performed street plays at Beixinjing Town, Hongqiao Town, Fahua Town, and Dashimingzhong, describing the atrocities of the Communist bandits. The lecture team, led by Dong Qichen, lectured on the significance of suppressing the rebellion and bandits in dance halls such as Central, Yangtze, and Silvers, theaters such as China, Jincheng, and Tianchan, and radio stations such as Greater China and Yuanchang. The propaganda team of displaced students, led by Gong Yunting and Yang Yisheng, was responsible for giving lectures and propaganda in various theaters, radio stations, and dance halls.

### Cui Xiangsheng Sentenced to Imprisonment for Transporting Bricks and Tiles for the Enemy

Cui Xiangsheng, 41, from Nantong, opened a transportation company at No. 27 Lane (Yuren Lane), Yunnan Road, this city. After the victory, he was suddenly reported to the Central Bureau of Statistics for the crime of treason. The reason was that in 1944, Cui and his father-in-law, Yuan Pengfei, and a Japanese Korean, Yoshihara Masa, organized the pseudo Brick and Tile Shipping Industry Association, with Yuan leading the way, Cui serving as the director and secretary-general, and Yoshihara serving as the association's instructor. He once forcibly pulled civilian ships for the enemy, and transported bricks and tiles from Xia Dianmiao near Jiaxing to Shanghai for the enemy's naval department, obtaining illegal profits. After investigation by the Central Bureau of Statistics, he was transferred to the High Court for trial. It is now known that the case has been concluded after several trials by the High Court. Yesterday, Cui Xiangsheng was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights for colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country. All property except for the necessary living expenses for family members was confiscated.

### Winter Relief Receives Donations: Has Reached Over 21.1 Billion

According to the Winter Relief Association's Fundraising Committee, since the launch of the fundraising campaign, it has received a total of 21,193,322,4138 yuan in donations. Among them, the film industry's fundraising has not yet ended, and donations are being raised one after another. Several large dance halls have not yet submitted their donations to the designated banks for collecting donations. The association hopes that they will put social tranquility first and send their donations to help refugees as soon as possible.

In addition, the sales of the charity housing lottery tickets issued by the association's housing sales department increased sharply during the Spring Festival. Many shops, firms, post offices, and companies that sell tickets on behalf of the association contact the association every day to receive new tickets.

In order to suppress prices, the municipal government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to strictly implement the measures for cracking down on hoarding and speculating on daily necessities during extraordinary periods issued by the Executive Yuan, and the Economic Affairs Department's newly revised implementation notes for the measures. According to the person in charge of the municipal government, the implementation of warehouse inspection and material registration may be too disturbing to the people. In order to prevent abuses, the implementation has been temporarily suspended. The two bureaus, Social Affairs and Police, will handle the matter in accordance with the measures for cracking down on hoarding and speculating on daily necessities, and reward those who report it in secret. The price of daily necessities can be expected to be suppressed.

### The Dayong Bloodshed: Cause and Effect – County Magistrate Killed by Local Militia – Huang Yingchuan’s Blood Stains the Suburbs

[Special Dispatch from Changsha, 8th] Huang Yingchuan, the newly appointed county magistrate of Dayong, Hunan, was refused entry and shot dead in the suburbs on January 28th. The news caused shockwaves everywhere. Following the incident, this reporter repeatedly visited relevant parties to investigate the cause and effect. A summary is presented below:

Starting from a Broader Perspective

Dayong is a corner of western Hunan, a remote mountainous town with a closed-off location and a strong-willed populace. In recent years, local factions here have been engaged in extremely fierce disputes. Huang Yingchuan’s assassination was a sacrifice made in the conflict between these "local factions." Below, the reporter will write about the course of these local factional conflicts. For ease of narration, let us assume it is a struggle between faction A and faction B.

Last May, the provincial government replaced the county magistrate with a new appointee, Tian Tingyu, a classmate of Chairman Wang from Baoding Military Academy. He was transferred from the position of Chief Instructor of the Provincial Cadre Training Corps. He was a native of Dayong and a very detached figure, seemingly a suitable choice. However, at that time, the communist bandits Wang Dinglie and Li Renlin were causing trouble in western Hunan. The heads of townships and towns in Dayong were originally chosen by the local gentry. Now, with the bandits approaching, it naturally became a pacification zone. The township heads and militia leaders had to be appointed by the county government. Tian had not yet taken office, and the old magistrate was in the provincial capital. The county government was run by the old magistrate's chief secretary. During this vacuum period, people from faction B seized the opportunity to coerce the county government into appointing a batch of township heads. When Tian arrived, they made a demand, wanting the new magistrate to acknowledge the legality of the old magistrate's appointments. Tian refused, and faction B believed that the county magistrate was showing favoritism towards faction A. Thus, they mobilized the local militia, approaching the county seat to demonstrate. The county government then announced martial law, and the police force was dispatched to patrol. Unfortunately, on May 7th, patrolling police were ambushed by the militia at the Guanyin Bridge outside the south gate, leading to the sensational so-called "May 7th Incident" that shook Hunan. At the time, Chairman Wang was inspecting western Hunan and was in Cili. Upon hearing the report on the 8th, he rushed to Dayong. Xiong Wugong fled. Chairman Wang dismissed Magistrate Tian, who had only been in office for five days, and transferred Li Shanhou, the Deputy Commander of the 9th Pacification District, to succeed him and handle the aftermath.

The Campaign to Oust Li Unfolds

Magistrate Li Shanhou was also a graduate of the Baoding Military Academy, and he was over fifty years old. This person was roughly similar to Tian, considered a detached figure. After the "May 7th Incident," this debt was attributed to faction B. Faction B's leader, Speaker Xiong Wugong, had fled and had not returned to the county. Magistrate Li naturally looked unfavorably upon faction B's actions and intentionally or unintentionally associated with people from faction A. Therefore, in the eyes of faction B, Li was the county magistrate of faction A, and they thought of ways to oust him every day.

This was the period of faction A's greatest prosperity. Faction B suffered a series of setbacks from then on, and everyone was uneasy. Thus, they launched a campaign to oust Li. Undoubtedly, if faction B wanted to oust Li, faction A would naturally support him. In the end, the ousting faction won, and the provincial government announced Huang Yingchuan's appointment as the county magistrate of Dayong.

Huang was a native of Baojing, a graduate of the 8th class of the Central Military Academy, 37 years old, and had served as the captain of the Hunan Security Brigade. He was currently a councilor in Baojing. When the provincial government's order was announced, it was like a bolt from the blue for people from faction A in Dayong, like a death sentence to them. Moreover, since people from Chu often spread rumors, rumors were rampant, saying that Huang would severely suppress faction A after taking office. As mentioned earlier, the people of Dayong are savage. If faction B could stage the "May 7th Incident," faction A might well stage another one.

After Huang received his appointment, he heard that the atmosphere in the county was unfavorable. The appointment was announced before the election of legislators, but he delayed his departure to avoid affecting the election. It was not until after the legislative election that he set out to take office. Unfortunately, he was assassinated halfway there. It was a truly tragic event.

A Letter from Huang Qi

Huang Yingchuan's younger brother, Huang Qi, came to the provincial capital from western Hunan on the 6th and submitted a letter to Chairman Wang, describing the tragic death of his brother. It was based on the account of the guards who accompanied Magistrate Huang to his new post and was extremely detailed. The gist was: Magistrate Huang departed from the provincial capital on January 17th, passing through Baojing and Yongshun to take office. On the 27th, he stayed at Houping in Dayong. At 3 PM on the 28th, he arrived at Zhangshu, a place outside the west gate of the county seat (about five li from the city), to rest. Suddenly, two old friends came to greet him and informed him that the city was currently under martial law, and slogans against Huang and supporting Li were plastered all over the streets. Soldiers were densely stationed around the city, determined to resist his entry into the city by force. They advised him not to enter the city to avoid accidents. Huang replied that his primary urgent task in coming to Dayong was to eliminate local disputes, and he himself stood purely on the government's detached position, with no favors or grudges towards any party. There was no need to worry too much. He instructed guard Peng to accompany him, while another guard, Xiang, temporarily stayed in place. He handed his self-defense pistol to Xiang. He also instructed Peng to leave his pistol with Xiang. Then, he, along with his entourage Cheng Mianzhi and Peng, entered the city. Unexpectedly, just as they reached the city gate, after walking only a few steps, someone raised a gun and shot him in the head. A soldier next to him also shot him with a rifle. He died instantly. Cheng and Peng were also killed at the same time. Guard Peng had not followed instructions beforehand and still kept his pistol inside his coat to prevent accidents. At that time, he wanted to take out his gun to protect him, but he was grabbed and held by two people empty-handed, and his gun was also snatched away. He struggled to break free and fled out of the city. Although he was shot at by soldiers above and below the city gate, he luckily escaped. (See "Letter to Chairman Wang")

Seemingly a State of War

After the incident, telecommunications were immediately cut off. After days of turmoil, the county's telecommunications were finally reestablished on the 6th. According to reports, the county seat was controlled by the "Support Li and Reject Huang" faction, while the area outside the city was controlled by the "Oust Li and Support Huang" faction. Both sides used local militias as their capital. High walls and deep trenches were built inside and outside the city, seemingly creating a state of war. People were panicked and living in constant fear. On the 7th, the county council, the county headquarters, and people from all walks of life sent a telegram to the provincial government, reporting the Dayong tragedy. They claimed that when Magistrate Huang came to Dayong to take office, he led hundreds of soldiers and guns, rushing into the city and declaring that he would slaughter the people who supported Li and rejected Huang. The people were outraged and unrestrained, leading to a firefight between the two sides. Huang Yingchuan was killed in the chaos. The above report differs significantly from the account given by Huang Yingchuan's younger brother, so it is recorded here for reference.

How to handle the Dayong tragedy is a tricky situation. The government authorities should first focus on eliminating the competition between local forces and punish the murderers. Otherwise, this case will inevitably fall into a deteriorating situation of escalating events and local rot. (Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru)

### Merger of Townships in Wuxian County: Disputes Arise in the Western District

### Yangqiao Bridge over the Wo River in Hao County: Seven Arches Burned by Bandits

[Special Dispatch from Hao County, 9th] A large wooden bridge over the Wo River in the urban area of Hao County was built by the enemy and puppet regime during the occupation. The bridge had 14 arches, a grand construction. More than 40 bandits suddenly sneaked into the northern end of the bridge a few days ago, poured kerosene all over it, and set it on fire for about half an hour. The local team and the civilian fire brigade extinguished the fire, destroying seven arches of the bridge. The bridge deck collapsed accordingly. Without major repairs, it will not be possible to restore it to its original state. This bridge is located south of Chechengjiao and north of Wobeizhai. Since the general blockhouse of Wobeizhai was destroyed by bandits on November 4th last year, it has no defenses. However, it is separated from Beiguanzhai by a river, facing each other, and it is easy to watch. Therefore, it has not been defended, and the bandits took advantage of the darkness to sabotage it, which seems to be a planned conspiracy.

The Suzhou Creek is one of the three major rivers in Shanghai. The river runs across the city, passing through Jiading and Qingpu, entering Kunshan and reaching Wuxian. In the past ten years, it has become increasingly silted. The Public Works Bureau is currently formulating a remediation plan, deciding to start with dredging. It is estimated that the entire dredging can be completed within four years.

When dancing, they were accompanied by gongs and drums, and children gathered around to watch and enjoy. This morning, some performers dressed as the God of Wealth snatched things from the Meixin Watch Shop on the street and even broke the glass. Policeman Meng Shengxi brought the "living God of Wealth" to the Eastern District Police Station for detention and confiscated the "gold ingots."

Therefore, today's world has no two paths to follow; otherwise, it will inevitably lead to destruction. If the ideal of the world as one family is not realized, humanity will perish; but to achieve this goal, we must promote the idea of one person in the world.

Our highest ideal is to become great incarnations of Christ for every individual." After the Mass, the conference opened. First, Nuncio Li delivered a speech, saying: I have inspected various parts of the country and deeply feel that China has gone through hardships in the eight years of the War of Resistance, and is still able to invigorate its spirit and strive for construction, which is admirable.

### Shanghai Team's Glorious Battle: Defeats Hong Kong Chinese Selection 2-1, Zhang Banglun Still the Best Performer, Shanghai Team's Forward Line Shows Vitality

[Our Newspaper Hong Kong Airmail] History repeats itself. Last year, the Shanghai team defeated the Hong Kong Chinese Selection team 1-0. This year, the Shanghai team again won against the Chinese Selection team 2-1. This year, the Hong Kong Chinese Selection team has a wealth of talent. It is truly glorious for the Shanghai team to defeat the Chinese Selection team. This was the battle on February 11th, and the battlefield was still at Happy Valley. As a result of the battle, the Shanghai team scored first in the first half, and in the second half it was 1-1. The Chinese Selection team was unable to reverse the situation. The Hong Kong Chinese Selection team's lineup for this battle remained as originally planned, while the Shanghai team made slight changes.

Hong Kong Chinese Selection Team's Strategic Failure

If compared in terms of lineup, I still believe that the Shanghai team is not superior to the Hong Kong team, but the Hong Kong team ultimately lost. Originally, the wings of the Chinese Selection team were truly not suitable for use on the field. We had already pointed this out when selecting the players. Who knew that Li Zhaorong also underperformed, with "inaccurate passes" and "weak shots." The entire forward line was only supported by Feng Jingxiang. It was naturally impossible for this forward line to score.

Strategically, the Chinese Selection team also made the biggest mistake. Seeing that the Shanghai team was tall, they still relied on high crosses. The wings were unwilling to dribble in after getting the ball, only relying on high passes, so the Shanghai team intercepted the entire offensive route.

Little Huangmao Has a Way Out

The best performer for the Shanghai team was Zhang Banglun, who saved Li Zhaorong's penalty kick and Feng Jingxiang's two dangerous shots, maintaining the Shanghai team's advantage. Fei Chunhua had a super-level performance. Han Longhai joined the forwards, giving Robert Stoff a way out. The Chinese Selection team lost due to improper strategic use and players underperforming.

At the start of the match, the Chinese Selection team pressed forward and attacked the Shanghai goal for ten minutes before seeing the Shanghai team counterattack. During this scramble, Hou Rongsheng committed a foul in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. "Lazy Bull" Li Yichen kicked the ball high, and the Chinese Selection team escaped disaster. They then switched to offense, and Feng Jingxiang's shot was unable to break through.

Fei Chunhua Particularly Determined

After twenty minutes, Fei Chunhua rushed in, and Xie Jinhong intercepted diagonally. "Little Fei" kicked, Jun'gan caught the ball, but Robert Stoff rushed forward and touched it, and the ball rolled into the net. The Hong Kong team conceded the first goal. After that, the Chinese Selection team tried hard to reverse the situation. Once, Li Shuoyou took a corner kick, and Banglun slapped the ball. Feng Jingxiang was lying behind and headed the ball, but it unfortunately hit the post and went wide. The Chinese Selection team had to be at a disadvantage in the first half.

Switching sides, both teams played steadily. After fourteen minutes, the Shanghai Selection team suddenly launched a rapid attack. Li Yao got the ball at the baseline and quickly crossed it in front of the goal. Robert Stoff made a feint, and Chunhua cleverly rushed forward and headed the ball into the net, 2-0. The Chinese Selection team suffered a blow. Feng Jingxiang fought hard, making one quick shot and one high cross, both saved by Banglun. After twenty minutes, Qixiang was penalized with a penalty kick. Zhaorong kicked it too lightly and was saved by Banglun. Until the thirty-second minute, Jinhe passed the ball diagonally to Jingxiang, who hooked the ball into the net from a dead angle, 2-1. The Chinese Selection team was ultimately unable to reverse the situation and lost by one goal again.

### Hengfeng Stocks Listed Today, Xinyi and Wuhe Can Be Restored Once Documents Are Complete

[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that the Shanghai Stock Exchange, after the former Ministry of Finance and Economics announced the major items of the "Measures for Handling After the Pre-subscription Method Expires," immediately sent letters to each listed securities company on January 29 this year, requesting them to comply, and set a deadline of 15 days after receiving the letter to submit the documents for special handling of change registration to the exchange. Subsequently, it was found that Xinyi Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, and Hengfeng Yarn Factory three families, failed to send the documents on time, and the stocks of the three factories were temporarily suspended from listing. Now Hengfeng Yarn Factory has submitted all the necessary documents, and the stocks of the factory will be relisted for trading today. The other two factories can be restored to listing as soon as the documents are completed.

Major Export Production Still Below Pre-War Levels

China's major exports, such as tung oil, soybeans, pig bristles, and tea, have seen their production far below pre-war levels due to domestic economic turmoil, transportation barriers, and the impact of foreign market exchange rates. According to statistics from an authoritative expert: Soybean production before the war was 145,787,000 market dans, now about 65,000,000 market dans; tea production before the war was 5,545,790 market dans, now about 4,500,000 market dans; tung oil production before the war was 1,029,789 metric quintals, now about 850,000 market dans; pig bristles production before the war was 56,149 metric quintals, now about 30,000 metric quintals; wool production before the war was 30,092 metric quintals, now about 15,000 market dans.

### Cigarette Market Strong

Yesterday, the cigarette market was strong. Due to the news that the raw material tobacco leaves rose by about 30-40%, the manufacturers' costs increased, and people were generally optimistic. The initial price of ten Great Britain cigarettes immediately rose by more than 2 million, with transactions at 49 million yuan. Subsequently, due to the easing of money, the industry's offsetting was strong, and the buying momentum was even stronger. The market broke through the 50,000 yuan mark, reaching a maximum of 51 million yuan, an increase of 4.4 million yuan from the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes also rose by 4.3 million yuan. Other Chinese and foreign cigarettes all rose by 5,000 to 240,000 yuan. However, after the close, the industry still had a small amount of absorption, and the market price of various cigarettes was raised again. Ten Great Britain cigarettes traded at 52 million yuan, twenty Great Britain cigarettes at 240,000 yuan per pack, Qianmen at 375,000 yuan, ten Qianmen at 405,000 yuan, Quanlu shouted 85,000 yuan, and the market atmosphere was very strong.

### Soap Prices Rise

The market for daily necessities soap, due to the raw material Yuepai caustic soda rising to around 60 million, and tallow to 6 million, the cost of finished products has increased, and manufacturers have not been distributing goods for a long time. The industry's inventory is empty, and there is an urgent need to replenish it. There are also retail investors absorbing it, and the market is running out of chips, so prices are frequently raised. The fixed base soap original price is 2.85 million, and the off-market price is as high as 3.4 million yuan, an increase of 320,000-330,000 yuan from the previous day. Huang Xiangmao is 2.25 million, the front knife is 2.7 million, and Guanghua Beauty is 2.1 to 2.56 million. The market for matches, candles, and kerosene is also very strong.

### Asphalt and Pig Bristles Shipped to England

[Our Newspaper Report] The Yitai Company's Glenartney, managed by the foreign department of Jardine Matheson, left Shanghai for England yesterday, carrying 300 tons of green oil (asphalt) and 300 boxes of pig bristles to London.

### A Major Fiscal Measure in France: The Devaluation of the Franc

— By Our Paris Correspondent, Yi Ruo

(1)

"The franc is going to be devalued," was the general feeling among Parisians for more than two months. The government first denied the rumors, then remained silent, and finally sent high-ranking officials to England and Washington to negotiate for "public support." At this time, the Paris stock exchange became active, and various stocks, especially foreign stocks, were heavily traded. On the 18th of this month, 130,000 shares were traded, a volume not seen in the past year. All political parties raised the banner of "preventing devaluation," claiming to be the protectors of the national currency, and stabilizing public sentiment was set as a national policy by those seeking to form a cabinet. Last night, Finance Minister Mayer specially invited representatives from Parisian newspapers and foreign press correspondents to his office, where he announced the devaluation of the franc: The exchange rate for the British pound would be 864 francs from the 26th of this month, and the US dollar would be 214 francs, these being the official rates; the market rate could still fluctuate. Parisians then realized that the news published in the Paris Evening News on November 7 of last year was accurate. The government denied the rumors but then admitted them themselves, but who cares about this unclear right and wrong? Everyone just goes on living. In the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 26th, the Prime Minister proclaimed that "preparations began in September of last year, when I was Minister of Finance"! Everyone was surprised.

This devaluation is the third since the war, in just three and a half years. Compared to the franc's predecessor, the Livre tournois, which circulated for eighty or ninety years (1710 to 1802) and was as stable as iron, it is truly incomparable. Even compared to the gold franc before the last World War, which was in use for one hundred and eleven years (from March 28, 1803 to August 1, 1914) without changing in quality or quantity, one cannot help but sigh at the decline of morals and the degradation of the times. What is the reason for this? The first devaluation after the war was appropriate for France to recover its old lands, and the military operations had not yet ended. In the autumn of 1944, the franc was temporarily fixed at "50 to 1 against the US dollar" and "200 to 1" against the British pound. When the military operations ended, foreign trade urgently needed to be organized, so a second devaluation was carried out at the end of December 1945, based on the actual value, changing the rate to 120 francs to one US dollar and 480 francs to one British pound. However, the operation was not thorough enough, commerce did not flow smoothly, and American aid and barter were not satisfactory, so there was this third devaluation.

(2)

This devaluation has cost the authorities a great deal of effort: repeatedly concealing it internally and employing all sorts of tricks externally. On November 7 of last year, the Paris Evening News said that the franc would be devalued. The next day, Finance Minister Schuman said: "The newspaper has infringed upon the dignity of the nation's finances," and sued in court, but nothing was heard of it afterward. On January 13 of this year, when the French parliament was in the midst of a heated election of the speaker, Economic Undersecretary Arlaud suddenly went to London, reportedly to discuss the reconvening of the Sixteen Nations Economic Conference, which was concluded the next day. Immediately after, French Minister of Economy and Finance Mayer followed, talking for three days without result, and returning to Paris on the 18th. At this time, financial expert Mendès France flew from Paris to Washington to discuss with the director of the International Monetary Fund, clarifying the "new foreign exchange value" of the franc: 250 francs to one US dollar, while maintaining the original price of 120 francs domestically, obtaining the Fund's approval. Unexpectedly, the next day (the 19th), the French government changed its mind, simply changing to the new value both domestically and internationally, and anyone who was dissatisfied could argue about it on the market. The Fund didn't mind, as it would facilitate the implementation of the Marshall Plan. The British were greatly displeased and immediately opposed it, this being the event of the 21st, so Mendès France, who had intended to return in triumph, received orders on the 22nd to postpone it. British Economic Undersecretary Sir Edmund Hall-Patch traveled swiftly to France, telling the French government, "This cannot be allowed!" Mayer was stunned. Hall-Patch immediately added: "If the agreement is cancelled, Britain will quadruple the supply of coal to France daily!" (25,000 tons!)

The French government saw that it could not devalue its currency on its own, so it consulted with its allies, Britain and the United States, but they had different opinions and seemed to be not of one mind. Prime Minister Schuman immediately convened Mayer, Bidault, Arlaud, and the governor of the Bank of France, Monick, on the evening of the 22nd to discuss countermeasures against Britain, and convened a cabinet meeting overnight, deciding not to follow British advice. However, the American International Monetary Fund was still undecided, and the French financial expert hesitated to proceed, as the Fund also opposed it, believing that France's unilateral devaluation would affect the future of international finance.

Finally, the last stage arrived. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Stafford Cripps suddenly flew to Paris and met with Schuman and Mayer. The next morning (the 24th) at 9:30, financial experts from both Britain and France gathered at the French Foreign Ministry for discussions. At 11:30, the experts participated in a meeting of economic undersecretaries and the British ambassador. At 12:30, a French cabinet meeting was held. At 2:30 PM, Bidault met with the British ambassador. Cripps left Paris at 4:40 PM and arrived in England at 6:30 PM, refusing any interviews. Some said that the progress of the Anglo-French negotiations and the International Monetary Fund's opinion on French policy could be announced at midnight. When midnight arrived, the cabinet spokesman said that it would have to wait until 7:00 PM on the 25th to be released simultaneously in Paris and Washington, and another night was wasted. At 10:00 AM on the 25th, the French side and the International Monetary Fund were still constantly consulting. The British economic undersecretary, seeing that there was nothing to say, led a second secretary from the British Treasury back to England at 2:30 PM, so that Mayer could quietly address the journalists at 7:00 PM and release the financial policy.

Originally, the devaluation of the franc was not so simple, nor was it directed solely at the US dollar and the British pound. First, although its new value was uniform domestically and internationally, it still carried the label of "official price." In addition, from the 29th, the market price could be obtained in the stock exchange according to the law of supply and demand (which is actually open financial speculation), freely rising and falling, so the franc had not yet escaped the "dual" price. No wonder Mayer said, "The current situation is still temporary." Second, its new value, in addition to devaluing itself by 80% against the British pound and the US dollar, was similarly self-deprecating against the currencies of other countries, such as the Canadian dollar, the Swiss franc, the Indian rupee, etc., rising with the US dollar, and even the Hong Kong dollar was set at 54 francs. Only the Chinese legal currency was ignored. Even within French territory, the value of the franc was not consistent. The French mainland had one price, as mentioned above. The territories of North Africa, South Africa, Oceania, and Central America, the Indian dependencies, and Annam under French control each had their own monetary system, some called francs, some called rupees, some called piastres, with different exchange rates. Some followed the devaluation of the French franc in the home country, such as Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Guyana, Antilles, etc.; some set new values to maintain the original value, such as those that formerly exchanged one French Indian rupee for 36 francs, now requiring 64 francs and 80 centimes; or set new values, further devaluing the local currency, such as in the Oceanic territories: New Caledonia, New Hebrides, etc., which originally exchanged one old French franc for two local francs and forty centimes, now requiring four local francs and thirty-two centimes to exchange for one new French franc after devaluation, is this not a double devaluation? Even the Vietnamese piastre (worth 17 francs) and the currencies of the South African territories, Reunion Island, Saint Pierre and Miquelon (worth one franc and seventy centimes), which maintained the "original parity," had actually fallen. No wonder the King of Morocco wrote to the French President, reportedly related to the local currency value; overseas parliamentarians questioned Prime Minister Schuman, believing that such collateral damage was arbitrary, and Schuman reluctantly agreed to discuss it further.

(4)

After the decree was published, the internal situation was as follows:

In the foreign market, based on the difference between the US dollar group and the British pound group, there were two phenomena. After the franc was devalued, the value of domestic exports was invisibly reduced by 80%, which could be sold smoothly without hindrance. However, the goods of the US dollar group are abundant, and there is no need for French products, and they also implement a tariff barrier policy, so it is a one-sided infatuation dream; no one firmly opposes it, nor enthusiastically approves it, unless they harbor nostalgia for Parisian perfume! Only a few dutiful officials of the International Monetary Fund, holding the articles, insist that it is illegal, and are deeply concerned that other countries will follow suit and dismantle the Fund's platform. In the countries of the British pound group, the dumping of French goods is imminent, plus the Paris exchange will soon open the buying and selling of gold and foreign currency (temporarily excluding the Portuguese escudo and the Portuguese real), the false price of the British pound will return from the officially set four dollars and three cents to the actual price of two dollars and eighty cents, which is no different from a threat to the British pound, a fatal blow, so the British ministers did not spare the labor of crossing the strait to come to Paris to prevent the devaluation of the franc, wasting a few days of abusive talk. Sure enough, on the day of the devaluation, the various stocks on the London Stock Exchange immediately fell by more than 20%, which is a clear proof; it is said that the countries of the British pound group will adopt a protectionist policy to deal with it, so the prospects for French exports are not optimistic.

Domestically, there is even more confusion and no consensus. First, look at the political parties: the most right-wing Republican Freedom Party, the most left-wing Communist Party, the Gaullist Party, and the Agrarian Party are firmly opposed. Even the Socialist Party revealed this intention, because it is an unpopular measure, initiated by Schuman of the Popular Republican Movement and implemented by Mayer, a member of the Radical-Socialist Party of free economic policies. In less than two months since Mayer took over both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy at the end of last November, he successively implemented: (1) a new fiscal plan, including new tax rules and compulsory public bonds, special donations, etc.; (2) devaluation of the franc; (3) free buying and selling of gold and foreign currency; (4) cancellation of the 5,000 franc banknote; (5) ... Each item has undergone fierce debates in the National Assembly. Sometimes they argue irreconcilably, and they have to be decided by "confidence" votes. It is rare to obtain a calm and rational majority. The General Confederation of Labor, the Catholic Confederation of Labor, and the New General Confederation of Labor (which evolved from the General Confederation of Labor) all stand in opposition. The general public is even more at a loss. Schuman said that only in this way can the French economy be revitalized!

(5)

At this time, the Ministry of Finance ordered at 2:00 AM on the 29th of this month: the 5,000 franc banknote is invalid from today, and merchants must not accept it again. This bolt from the blue immediately alarmed 40 million French people, and all newspapers published special editions. Immediately, many Yan Song-style beggars wandered the streets, their pockets full of 5,000 franc banknotes, unable to buy a loaf of bread; the VIPs of major hotels wanted to borrow a thousand or two thousand francs from the front desk, but the boss replied: "Room and board can be credited temporarily, but please don't ask for petty expenses!" A black market with a 30% discount immediately appeared in the market, each banknote worth only 3,500 francs. The same day's exchange rate in Algiers, North Africa, was only 3,200 francs. All banks across the country simultaneously closed for two days according to the order, suspending exchanges, and reopening only after the National Assembly voted on the measures. According to the banknotes circulating in the market, there are a total of 330 billion francs, accounting for more than one-third of the total currency.

The National Assembly immediately discussed the issue of the withdrawal of banknotes, debating hotly, until 4:30 AM this morning, passing the government proposal with only 307 votes to 286; the exchange procedures will be stipulated by separate legislation. As for the free buying and selling of gold and foreign currency, it remains to be decided by the National Assembly today or tomorrow, which is a major item in financial issues.

From the devaluation of the franc to the withdrawal of banknotes, it is a new phenomenon in French finance, alarming European and American countries (Paris, January 30)

### The Atom Smasher

— Yang Shi

The atom smasher (Cyclotron) is of great merit to the brilliant achievements and rapid progress of atomic physics today. There is no consistent translation of its name in our country. It is often translated as "Harmonic Revolving Machine", "Rotary Accelerator", "Cyclic Energy Booster" and "Atom Splitter" in newspapers and magazines. In advanced scientific publications, it is referred to as "Magnetoelectric Accelerator". For the sake of popularity and easy understanding, we still use "Atom Smasher". Its appearance has not only opened a new era for modern physical research, but also has great influence on chemistry, biology and medicine. Its inventor is Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence, a professor at the University of California in the United States. In order to reward his great contribution, the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to him, and since then the research center of the atomic nucleus was transferred from Cambridge University in England and the Academy of Sciences in Germany to the United States. The mystery of this tool has been maintained for a long time before it was revealed.

Principle

Before introducing its entire content, let’s talk about its principle of generation. According to the experiments and inferences of Bohr (N. Bohr) and Wheeler (J. A. Wheeler), all chemical elements except silver are in the so-called "metastable state". Regardless of the process of fusion (the combination of two light elemental nuclei into one) or fission (the splitting of one heavy elemental nucleus into two), an astonishing amount of stored energy is released. Therefore, a scientist said that we live in a terrible gunpowder depot, which is not an exaggeration. Imagine that once these tiny atomic nuclei split and explode, wouldn’t they be atomic bombs? But why don't they have atomic nuclear fission or fusion? This still requires sufficient activation energy to be given to the atomic nucleus. For example, if the atomic nuclei of two light elements approach each other, they will fuse, but when they approach to a certain distance, they will be separated by the mutual repulsion of their own positive charges. Similarly, the atomic nucleus of a heavy element must be subjected to extremely violent impacts before it can split. In fact, there will never be such a strong thing to impact it normally. We must artificially think of ways to increase the activation energy of a projectile before going to the inside of the atomic nucleus to give it a fatal blow before it can split.

With sufficient activation energy to impact an atomic nucleus, the situation is not simple, and many difficulties must be overcome along the way. The barrier surrounding the atomic nucleus is a repulsive force like a wall. When a proton (a small particle with a positive charge) rushes near the atomic nucleus with sufficient energy, it is first resisted by this repulsive force. Unless it advances to a certain close distance to receive the attraction of cohesive force, it will be repelled and defeated. Therefore, we must think of ways to give this charging proton a high speed, so that it can rush to the distance where it can receive the cohesive force in one go. Giving the proton a very large initial energy is the so-called sufficient activation energy.

In addition, according to quantum theory, the resonance phenomenon is important and necessary when impacting the atomic nucleus. Here, resonance refers to the energy of the impacting projectile being equal to the resonant energy of the impacted atomic nucleus. Therefore, whether the proton rushes too fast or too slow reduces the chance of collision. Only at the "appropriate" speed is it almost every collision will split. Based on this principle, the Alpha particles released by various radioactive substances in the decay process were first used as projectiles to impact atomic nuclei, but due to the difficulty in obtaining radioactive substances, scientists wanted to use charged particles (such as protons) to fill this errand. As long as the protons in the strengthened field are accelerated, they can be used to impact. The first to use this principle was Cockroft and Walton of Cambridge University in England, who designed the atomic accelerator (Atomic accelerator or atom-smasher) in 1932. The equipment is simple, and the highest voltage is one million volts, using ordinary capacitors, but it is not much better than Alpha points. Later, Professor Robert L. Van de Graaff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States also completed the electrostatic generator. He used a simplest principle: "Charge is transmitted on a sphere and immediately spread on its surface" to increase the voltage to three or four million volts; and give the proton several energies. (One Crocodile is one million electron volts, abbreviated MeV. The meaning of this energy unit is the transmission of energy to a particle that has been accelerated in an electric field of one million volts and carries a unit charge, which is equal to 1.6 times of the micro-erg, the energy unit we usually use.)

Structure

Using this principle, the most ingenious design is still Dr. Lawrence’s atom smasher, which does not require very high voltage like an electrostatic generator. When a charged particle moves in a uniform magnetic field, its direction of motion is affected by the magnetic field lines, and the straight-line motion is changed to circular motion. The radius of the circle depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the initial velocity of the particle. The faster the motion, the smaller the deflection, and the larger the circle. Based on this fact, he built a very large vacuum chamber, with a flat brass box in the middle divided into two semicircular vacuum chambers with insulators. The two vacuum chambers are respectively connected to an AC motor with a terminal voltage of 20,000 volts and 20 million cycles per second. In this way, in each very short period of time, the two semicircular vacuum chambers are charged with opposite charges and have a potential difference of 20,000 volts. Generally speaking, the two semicircular chambers are always alternately charged eleven; one ten; eleven; .... Outside the vacuum chamber there is a large and strong electromagnetic field, a charged plate connected to a DC motor with a terminal voltage of 100,000 volts and a target.

When a group of protons are introduced into this vacuum chamber, they will be repelled by the positive charge in chamber A and attracted by the negative charge in chamber B, so that the group of protons enter chamber B from chamber A, and then the deflection effect of the electromagnetic field causes the protons to move in a circular arc. Up to chamber B, due to one cycle of the alternating current, chamber B is ten, chamber A is one, and the protons are forced to enter chamber A in a circular arc again. This strengthens its speed time and time again, and the radius of the circle also increases time and time again, making the protons rotate spirally in the vacuum chamber. Finally, when the radius of the unwinding spiral orbit becomes equal to the radius of the chamber, the proton beam is emitted through the small window. Due to the existence of the charged plate, the high-speed proton group is forced to accurately impact the target along a certain orbit. The element to be impacted is placed on the target. If uranium-235 is placed on the target, its atomic nucleus will be impacted and split, and this splitting will continue, which is the so-called chain reaction (Chain of reaction).

The first atom smasher he built is now very small. The two poles of the electromagnet are only 37 inches in diameter and weigh 85 tons. The second one is 64 inches in diameter and weighs 200 tons, and can generate proton beams with energy of 25 crocodiles. Recently, Dr. Lawrence has completed another one weighing 4,000 tons called "Synchro-cyclotron"), and the greatness of its activation energy to protons can be imagined.

Application and Improvement

As mentioned earlier, the atomic nucleus is the heart of the atom. Its surroundings are wrapped in the envelope of electrons. A proton that rushes into the envelope may lose its direction and fail to accurately collide with the atomic nucleus itself, and in order to overcome the barrier, it loses a part of its energy. Therefore, there is very little chance that a group of protons will collide with the atomic nucleus while their speed is still strong. It is possible that only one out of thousands of protons will complete its mission. This is a bit of a loss. Therefore, in practice, there is not much hope of using artificially accelerated charged particles to impact atomic nuclei and release great stored energy.

In order to remedy this shortcoming, there are two ways to generate atomic fission on a large scale: one is to heat a mixture of a target and a projectile to a very high temperature and cause strong mutual collisions to promote fission. One is to use neutrons instead of protons as impacting projectiles. The latter has been adopted, using the so-called "Neutron-multiplication" to make it the most ideal projectile. Let's put these tables aside for now.

The importance of the atom smasher is as mentioned above, but unfortunately China does not yet have one. According to statistics, in the fall of 1941, there were more than 120 seats distributed in the laboratories of various famous universities in the United States, three in the United Kingdom, one in the Soviet Union, one in France, one in Canada, one in Denmark, and one in Japan. After the victory, it was reported that Japan had also designed two by itself, but they were all ordered to be demolished by the US military.

It is worth mentioning that Dr. Wang Pu of Fu Jen Catholic University in Peiping also made outstanding contributions to atomic nuclear physics, that is, he and RB. Roberts and R. C. Meyer used an atom smasher to impact potassium targets in the Carnegie Institute in the United States and discovered the most important "Delayed neytron" phenomenon. This shows that as long as Chinese scientists have tools and environment, they will surely have many brilliant achievements. In addition, the discovery of Qian Sanqiang and his wife in Paris is also commendable. The Peiping Research Institute plans to change the Radium Research Institute into the Atomic Research Institute, and wants to build an atomic building in Peiping East Imperial City, specializing in the research of atomic physics, which are all good news for the scientific community. We hope that the government will give more funding and make some achievements as soon as possible.

### The Aurora Borealis

This is not a stage curtain, but a celestial flow of the Aurora Borealis, colorful, dazzling, presenting a spectacle of nature (see "The Aurora" in Issue 24 of this journal).

Professor Robert J. Van de Graaff invented the electrostatic generator in 1931. The figure shows the model created for the first time and personally demonstrated. The one installed in the Westinghouse Electric Company's laboratory is extremely large, and its volume is almost the same as that of the gas storage tank of the Shanghai Gas Company. It also has atom smasher equipment ( ).

### The Method of Making Blueprints

— Liu Suisheng

Blueprints are commonly used in construction, statistics, and contracts. What are the medicines, procedures, and principles used in making blueprints? I believe this is what readers are eager to know. Therefore, based on my years of experience in the chemistry laboratory, I will describe it in detail as follows:

(1) Preparation of Blueprint Paper　Although there are several kinds of medicines used in preparing blueprint paper, the following two medicines are usually used:

1.  Ammonium ferric citrate; 2. Red prussiate of potash.

The method is to put 1.5 grams of ammonium ferric citrate into 10 cubic meters of warm water, stir thoroughly to dissolve it, and call it solution A; then take 2 grams of red prussiate of potash, also dissolve it in 10 cubic meters of warm water, stir thoroughly to dissolve it completely, and call it solution B. Mix solutions A and B in a dark room or under red light, and stir more to ensure that they are mixed evenly. Then, take a sponge or cotton, soak it in the mixed solution, and apply it to the drawing paper, making it bright yellow. Still place it in a dark room and let it dry in the shade, then store it properly, do not expose it to light, and keep it for later use.

(2) Blueprint Printing Procedure　First, use a pen and ink to draw a table or calligraphy on a glass plate or tracing paper for later use. Then take the photographic frame, turn it upside down on the table, remove the wooden board and photo, and leave the glass. Then, place the glass plate or tracing paper with the diagram or calligraphy upside down on the original glass; then place the blueprint paper upside down on the tracing paper; then cover it with a wooden board and press it tightly with a sheath. Then, hold the photographic frame and move it into the sunlight, so that the sunlight shines directly on the front for about five to ten minutes, depending on the intensity of the sunlight. But see the yellow blueprint paper gradually changing color, eventually appearing gray with a brownish color. Take out the blueprint paper, and you will see that the original ink marks are still yellow where they are covered. Place it in clean water and wash for a few minutes, and you will have a blueprint with a blue background and white patterns or calligraphy. According to personal experience, the longer the immersion time in water, the clearer it is. If you want to deepen the blue color, you should add salt water or hydrochloric acid to the clean water.

(3) Blueprint Correction Method　If you draw more dots on the tracing paper, the printed blueprint will have more white dots. To correct it, simply apply a mixture of ammonium ferric citrate and red prussiate of potash, expose it to sunlight, and then wash it. If you draw fewer dots on the tracing paper, the printed blueprint will lack dots. You can use alkaline solutions such as baking soda (NaHCO3) water, or washing soda (Na2CO3．IOH2O) solution, or caustic soda solution, or even soapy water as ink, to add the missing dots, and the blue color will fade away and appear as white spots.

(4) The Principle of Blueprint Generation　In our chemical experiments, we usually produce two kinds of blue precipitates: one is called Prussian blue, scientifically known as ferrous ferricyanide (Fe4〔Fe（CN）6〕3); the other is called Turnbull's blue, scientifically known as 化 (Fe3〔Fe（CN）6〕2). The former is produced by adding yellow prussiate of potash (also known as potassium ferrocyanide, K4Fe(CN)6) solution to a ferric salt such as ferric trichloride (FeCl3) or ferric sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3) solution; the latter is produced by combining a ferrous salt such as green vitriol (FeSO4·7H2O) also known as ferrous sulfate solution, with red prussiate of potash (also known as potassium ferricyanide, K3Fe(CN)6) solution. However, if the ferric salt and ferrous salt are interchanged, no blue precipitate can be obtained. For example, if the ferric salt solution is mixed with the red prussiate of potash solution, no blue precipitate will occur. The principle of blue circle formation is based on this: because ammonium ferric citrate is a ferric salt, it does not change when mixed with red prussiate of potash solution, and it remains unchanged when applied to paper without light; but when exposed to sunlight, the ferric salt is gradually reduced to a ferrous salt, and Turnbull's blue occurs with red prussiate of potash. However, where the ink marks are covered, the light cannot pass through, so no change occurs. After being washed with water, it flows away with the water, so it remains white.

If readers have considerable experience, they can proceed to print photos, that is, replace the tracing paper with calligraphy with a photographic negative, and print, wash, and dry it according to the law, and you can succeed. Also, the made blueprint paper is best used within a few days; if it takes more than half a month, there is a risk of failure, which should be noted.

(Note) (1) Ammonium ferric citrate: It is a dark reddish-brown transparent crystal, deliquescent, and deteriorates when exposed to light. It is usually tightly packed in colored bottles. It is easily soluble in water. Commercially available blood tonics often contain this type of organic iron salt. The molecular formula is (NH4)3FeC(6H5O7)2, which is made by adding citric acid H3．C6H5O7) to ferric hydroxide Fe(OH)3), and then adding ammonia water (NH4OH).

(2) Red prussiate of potash: It is a bright red, lustrous crystal, easily soluble in water, and highly toxic. It can be made by passing chlorine into yellow prussiate of potash solution: Cl2+2K4Fe(CN)6—2K3Fe(CN)6+3KCl．

### Alchemy

— Zhang Changqing

Perhaps everyone has read the stories of "turning iron into gold" or "turning stone into gold", but when you see it in the newspaper now, it is no longer a story but a fact.

Since atomic research has been advancing rapidly, some people have tried to artificially transform atoms. Last year, a scientist turned lead into gold. Lead is a cheap metal, so what is so rare about gold? But rest assured, the cost of turning an ounce of lead into gold is several times more expensive than real gold!

The gold transformed by this method looks exactly like real gold at first glance, but if you make it into a gold ring and wear it on your hand, although you don't feel hot, your skin will be burned after a few days. It turns out that there are still many protons hidden in the special surface to be released. After this kind of gold is hidden for a year, its protons are completely released, and it will be exactly the same as real gold.

Unfortunately, although gold is precious, it has not much use except as decoration and currency. Why don't smart scientists study some methods for making coal, cloth, and rice to relieve the widespread famine in the world!

### Talking About Gambling

— Jingwen

The atmosphere of gambling in Shanghai has always been very strong, and during the few days of the Lunar New Year, gambling sounds can be heard everywhere. Adults gamble, children also gamble, families become small casinos, and streets and alleys are public casinos. Shanghai in the New Year is almost turned into Monte Carlo.

In Shanghai, there is a saying that whoring is all empty, gambling is a hedge, eating is enjoyable, and dressing is prestigious. The "hedge" in the saying "gambling is a hedge" is probably a different pronunciation of the word "折" (zhé, fold), meaning that gambling only has a 50% chance, which is slightly better than whoring, but it always contains a 50% risk.

However, the tempting power of gambling probably lies in this 50% risk. Because if gambling is guaranteed to win money, then it should be like the saying "whoring can even pay you back, gambling can win money, is the number one business in the world". Only because gambling cannot guarantee winning money, but has a 50% chance of winning, can people enjoy it and never tire of it, and even squander their family fortunes for it.

People who are addicted to gambling are generally superstitious people. Although they all know that gambling is a labor-intensive and money-wasting activity, and they know that it is a losing game, they still believe that they can grasp the so-called "road". In the stock exchange, there are so-called charting experts, and in large casinos, there are also charting friends, and it is said that they also have so-called "scientific" basis. However, apart from the casino owners, I have never heard of a charting expert who has made a fortune by gambling. On the contrary, I have seen some "蹩脚生" (bé jiǎo shēng, clumsy students) who specialize in charting routes for gamblers. They themselves are victims in the gambling arena, and are failed veterans.

The old Russian writer Dostoevsky, who wrote "The Gambler", was himself a person who was addicted to gambling; in his wife's "Memoirs", she said that Dostoevsky was confident that he had a deep grasp of gambling methods, especially for roulette. But during a period of traveling in Germany, Dostoevsky not only lost all the advance royalties, but even almost ended up stranded in another country. However, throughout his life, he never lost his love for gambling.

A person of such wisdom as Dostoevsky actually deeply believed that there were reliable methods in gambling, which shows how tempting gambling is.

But if we can understand the adventurous nature that humans share, it is not difficult to understand the mysterious attraction of gambling. Humans are inherently gamblers. Human's fighting, war-loving, and competitive characters are all just the character of a gambler. It needs stimulation, it needs venting, and the tools and methods of gambling can just provide this need. So, rather than saying that gambling has a profound attraction, it is better to say that it is because of the weaknesses in people's character, especially in people's social lives.

The spirit of fighting and adventuring may not be said to be a weakness, because the success of many great undertakings often stems from this spiritual motivation. But if the social atmosphere only encourages the spirit of fighting and adventuring in the path of luck, then when people's spirits cannot find proper venting, they will naturally only tend to all the so-called "extracurricular pastimes" and this set of playthings.

### What Happens If There Are Too Many Vitamins

— Jun

We all know that vitamins are essential elements for maintaining normal physiological changes in the human body. Lack of vitamins will prevent normal physiological changes from being maintained, and various diseases will occur. For example, lack of vitamin A will cause night blindness and keratosis; lack of vitamin B1 will cause beriberi, neuritis, and acute cardiac weakness; lack of vitamin C will cause scurvy; lack of vitamin D will cause rickets and osteomalacia; lack of vitamin E will cause infertility. In recent years, scientists have discovered many more vitamins, totaling more than thirty.

The popularity of various vitamin products on the market shows that the importance of vitamins has been recognized by the general public.

But, is it harmful to have too many vitamins?

According to recent research results, if the human body takes in too many vitamins, its physiological changes will also be abnormal and cause disease.

It is currently known that excessive amounts of vitamins A and D can cause poisoning. The former causes symptoms such as nausea, headache, vomiting, sluggishness, and drowsiness, while the latter increases the amount of calcium in the blood, resulting in decreased sensitivity of muscles and nerves, and can also cause serious consequences such as calcification of the kidneys, myocardium, and blood vessels. According to animal experiments, vitamin B1 is also toxic, it can dilate peripheral blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and paralyze the respiratory center of the medulla oblongata, causing difficulty breathing, and even death, but how toxic it is to humans remains to be studied.

Too much is as bad as too little, and vitamins are no exception.

### New Year Bamboo Painting

— Zhang Yiqu

Yesterday (the 14th), the Shanghai painters held a "Spring Festival Reunion" at Guanshengyuan. I happened to be fortunate enough to attend. In these times of turmoil and chaos, I couldn't help but feel touched. Upon returning, I spread out the paper and painted bamboo, and inscribed a quatrain. I would like to take this opportunity to wish for world peace.

After the disaster, the cold jade shadow is blurred,
The strong green is better than nothing,
Trying my brush for the first time to wish for peace,
The picture of bamboo in my heart is in it.

### Lighting Candles at Guangjue Temple

On New Year's Eve, I went to the City God Temple. It was too crowded, so I sat down in the Donglou Teahouse in the right wing. From the window, I looked at the front of the City God's altar. On several rows of candlesticks, small red candles were constantly being lit and inserted, blown out and pulled out, and then thrown into the large bamboo basket on the side. The head monk was smiling, counting his considerable income for this year and this night, perhaps he had already contracted tens of thousands of pounds of candle oil to that candle shop. The temple was so busy that his face was oily, and his whole body was like a candle. He also seemed to be happy tonight, and could get some incense money. The devout men and women did not care how many seconds their incense offerings to the gods lasted. They looked up, raised their hands, and held up the red candles and sent them upward. They were all solemnly thanking the gods for protecting them this year; and they were also sincerely praying that they would still rely on the gods for protection in the coming year. This is not superstition - the object of everyone's faith may be the everlasting symbol of loving the people like children represented by the mud and wood statues.

Around midnight, there were two drumbeats in front of the hall, who was the first to offer incense? There were more and more people, the light of the candles became brighter and brighter, and the smoke of the incense became thicker and thicker.

When I got home, it was almost dawn. My wife bought a pair of gold-lettered red candles, which were shining brightly on the table. Next to them were wintersweet flowers, and the petals looked transparent and beautiful when viewed through the candlelight. The candlelight, as if teasing them intentionally, exuded bursts of fragrance. People feel that some old things are really indispensable: the firecrackers outside the door, the distant gongs and cymbals, are all indispensable; this pair of tall red candles in front of people and flowers is even more indispensable.

### The Three Heroes of Hubei

— Chen Yixian

In the early years of the Republic of China, Beijing had the reputation of the Three Heroes of Hubei. The three heroes were President Li Yuanhong, Opera King Tan Xinpei, and Xiaofeng, a famous courtesan from Shaanxi Lane. All three were natives of 鄂 (È, Hubei), hence the name.

Before the Republic of China, my family lived in Tanhualin, Wuchang. Li was the Association Commander (协统, xié tǒng), and his uncle, Mr. Wang Ping, became sworn brothers with my father, and the two families had contact. After the establishment of the Republic of China, my family moved to Shanghai. Li was the Governor of Hubei and was also elected as the Vice President. Li read my translated "Two Years in the Qing Palace" and praised it. He asked Song Dunfu to write a letter to my father, wanting to recruit me into the Governor's Office to work in the foreign affairs department, but I did not go due to illness. Li's character, although not a great talent, but his refusal to accept Yuan Shikai's title of Prince Wuyi and his refusal to Duan Qirui's order to dissolve the parliament, his integrity was not easy, and he has his own place in the history of the Republic of China.

Tan Xinpei was from Shahu, outside the Xiaodongmen in Wuchang. In his early years, he and his father fled famine to Beijing. He first studied martial arts and then changed to singing old male roles (鬚生, xū shēng). His fame rose sharply. His singing of the play "Selling Horses" (賣馬, mài mǎ) could express the state of a hero's frustration and boredom to the fullest extent. He was known as the natural Qin Shubao. He entered the inner court as a court actor and had the name Tan Beile (谭贝勒, Tán Bèi lè). One year, there was a flood in Hubei, and my brother asked him to give a charity performance to help the disaster relief, which he happily agreed to, and he also donated hundreds of taels of small silver ingots that the Empress Dowager had rewarded him over the years to help the disaster relief. During the transition between the Guangxu and Xuantong reigns, Tan performed opera in Zhongheyuan. Those who accompanied him were the famous female role singer Wang Yaoqing and the famous clown Wang Changlin. The price of the play was 1,600 copper coins per person, which was only 160 copper coins in southern currency. My brothers and friends often listened to operas. The painter Liu Baochen from the same hometown suggested that we were "obsessed with Tan" (痰迷心竅, Tán mí xīn qiào). One day, Tan performed "Heavenly Thunder Retribution" (天雷報, Tiān Léi Bào). We strongly pulled Liu Baochen to watch it. When it came to the most intense part of Qingfeng Pavilion, Sai Chen couldn't help but shed tears, which shows how deeply Tan's play moved people. People in Shanghai only know that "Losing the Empty City" (失空斬, Shī Kōng Zhǎn) is Tan's unique skill, but they don't know that his "The Scholar's Score" (狀元譜, zhuàng yuán pǔ) (Visiting the Grave for the Nephew) especially has the beauty of art. Tan would always ask us to watch this play every time he performed it.

Xiaofeng enjoyed a great reputation in the early years of the Republic of China. Her appearance was not very beautiful. Several years later, around the tenth year of the Republic of China, my brother Cai Ziyu and I went to Yangtaishan to see the apricot blossoms and stayed in Shuangfeng Temple. One morning, the two of us sat in rattan sedan chairs to Dajue Temple. The apricot blossoms were all over the forest along the way, like peppercorns and beans, or red breaking through white dew. The morning sun shone on them, and the light was extremely beautiful. There were two magnolia trees in Tianjue Temple, as high as the eaves. The flowers were the most famous. When we went, the flowers had bloomed eight or nine points. While wandering in the courtyard, we met Fu Yuanshu and Bai Lizhai. They invited us into the room to eat porridge. We saw Wang Kemin as the host. The table was lined with ham, meat floss, preserved eggs and other porridge dishes, as well as two large plates of Gaozhuang steamed buns. A woman came out of the inner room to greet us. She seemed familiar. We said goodbye and left. Bai Lizhai sent us to the temple gate. I privately asked who the hostess was. Lizhai laughed and said, "Don't you even know the famous Xiaofeng?" Some people mistakenly thought that the one who was intimate with Cai E was Xiaofeng, but in fact, the famous courtesan who designed to help Cai leave Beijing and go to Yunnan to launch an uprising was Xiaofengxian. When Cai died overseas, a memorial service was held in the Central Park of Beijing. Xiaofengxian rushed to the spirit and cried bitterly, and personally hung a mourning couplet: "Unfortunately, Zhou Lang died young, I knew Li Jing was a hero." She regarded herself as Hong Fu, which was extremely self-important. Xiaofeng and Xiaofengxian were both famous courtesans, but the people they admired were so different.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 10: Voluntary Sacrifice (71)

Zhu Zhai said: "Just on the road, and the boss usually goes everywhere to look for it. I am really worried. At least I have to ask the police on duty if they saw a female guest fall and get injured. Moreover, recently, because the American army has just arrived in Peiping, there are especially many cars coming and going on the road, and they drive especially fast. There are car accidents every day. If there is misfortune, what can I do? I must go out and find it." Seeing that Zhu Zhai was determined to leave, Xiao Wang's mother said, "Mr. Xu, you haven't eaten yet, and the wind is strong outside, and it's very cold. Eat something before you go out!" Zhu Zhai said, "I can't eat. I'll eat again when I find the boss." Saying that, he put on his coat, put on his hat, and left in a hurry. When he came out of the alley, he saw that it was all white. The snow on the ground had already accumulated several inches, and the snowflakes in the air were pouring down on his head. Zhu Zhai braved the cold and snow and walked along the road. After a while, a coat, the entire back of his shoulders, was completely covered with snowflakes. Zhu Zhai walked while observing the ground. Apart from the messy ruts and footprints, there was no one lying on the road. He was very suspicious. Could it be that Qi Wan was hit by a car and injured on the road, and was sent to the hospital, so he couldn't see it. Whenever he saw a policeman on duty on the road, he asked him if anyone had been hit by a car and injured, which made many policemen on duty think that this person was mentally ill. The more Zhu Zhai walked on the road, the more panicked he became. His feet slipped and he fell, getting mud and snow all over his body. He got up and ran forward, ignoring everything. He searched for a long time, but there were no signs. He was so anxious that he almost wanted to cry out. Since he couldn't find her on the main street, he turned into the small alleys and searched again. After several hours of searching, there was still no trace. He thought that he had been out for a long time. Maybe she had already gone home while I was looking for her on the street. With this hope in his heart, he hurried back. When he got home, he pressed the doorbell outside the door and asked Xiao Wang's mother if the boss had returned. Xiao Wang's mother said, "No!" Zhu Zhai didn't say a word when he heard this, and walked into the house with his head down. Seeing that he had been out for a long time, Xiao Wang's mother said, "My lord, how did you get into this situation!" Zhu Zhai shook his head and said, "I searched everywhere and asked many policemen, but no one saw her." Xiao Wang's mother said, "What's the use of asking the police?" Zhu Zhai said, "She's not on the road, nor at the homes of relatives and friends. I'm afraid she was injured by a car on the road and sent to the hospital." Xiao Wang's mother said, "Don't worry, if that really happened, they would send us a letter!" Zhu Zhai said, "Who would send us a letter?" Xiao Wang's mother said, "Why don't you understand? If she's injured and sent to the hospital, the hospital wouldn't send a letter! Everyone knows the boss's name."

### The Yu Opera in Lanzhou (Part 2)

— Junzuo

This new Yu opera creator has been dedicated to the reform of Yu opera since 1931. He grew up in the modern Central Plains, the modern China, where there was constant turmoil and endless sorrow. He felt the aggression of strong enemies from the outside, and the darkness of society from the inside. Therefore, in the adapted scripts, he can best meet the trend of the times and the voices of the masses, and he can still promote the advantages of local characteristics. This is his advantage, which is indeed extraordinary. However, Mr. Fan's performance in the past year or two has not been good enough. Although he independently leads the Lion Roar Troupe he formed in Xi'an, unfortunately, until today, I have not seen any new masterpieces from him.

Wang Jingyun is one of his proudest disciples. This female performer, who was very popular in Lanzhou, is only about eighteen or nineteen years old. Song Shuyun is best at performing tragedies. She sings countless tears in "Selling Horses" and "Pipa Record", and her age is gradually increasing, and her family burden is very heavy. The regret is that the two of them are too unharmonious. This kind of jealousy of old-fashioned actors should no longer exist. There is also a Li Lanju who is also quite popular. They all compete to be the leading actress and sing the final show. They used to make a mess of it. After the change to New Light, although it is not a military management, it is still a bit of a public atmosphere, and the atmosphere between the three popular actresses is not as tense as before.

In addition to these few people, there are also three very good roles: a martial arts actor, an old male role, and a clown. In this way, the team is considered complete. Cultural workers in Lanzhou who love Yu opera are planning to launch this Yu opera reform movement, inviting Fan Cuiting to Lanzhou to write and direct several brand-new scripts to meet the requirements of wartime national construction. The reform of Yu opera, that is, the creation of new Yu opera, is nothing more than starting from the script, props, acting skills, singing, scene, music, lighting, and actors. For example, Yu opera used to have quite a few instruments, such as the soft-bow erhu, hard-bow erhu, moon lute, three-stringed lute, and four-stringed lute. In recent years, because the voices of the actors are too low, it has been reduced to the least possible number. However, when Yu opera queen Chen Suzhen performs, she must add four or five erhus or other stringed instruments. If she can also adopt the strengths of Qin opera and Peking opera music, it will not be as monotonous and tasteless as listening to Yu opera music today. This is a key point that Yu opera must reform.

I remember last winter in Shanghai, I talked to Mr. Pan Gongzhan about the literary revolution movement. Mr. Gongzhan repeatedly emphasized the necessity of reforming local operas to modernize, popularize, and artisticize them. Unfortunately, Mr. Gongzhan could not come to Lanzhou to see the Henan opera, that is, Yu opera, that I introduced. I think Mr. Gongzhan would definitely praise it and think it has reform value. I think Mr. Gongzhan would definitely appreciate Wang Jingyun's youth and beauty and Song Shuyun's deep performance. If possible, the New Light Troupe in Lanzhou is very willing to go to Shanghai for a performance and seek advice. According to my thoughts, the audience's reaction will definitely not be lower than watching the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe, right? (March 7, 1938, sent from Lanzhou)
