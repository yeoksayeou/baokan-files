### The New Executive Yuan is Being Organized; Most Ministerial Heads Confirmed; Weng Wenhao Visits President for Instructions on the List; Likely to be Announced Today; Both the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Invited to Nominate Participants

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] Weng Wenhao's new Executive Yuan was being negotiated and organized all day on the 25th. Weng visited the President at nine o'clock in the morning, engaging in a long talk for four hours, finally departing at one o'clock in the afternoon. Weng sought instructions regarding the list of the Deputy Premier, heads of various ministries, and the chief and deputy secretaries-general. He then proceeded to make separate contacts based on these instructions. This list will not be announced until after confirmation through these contacts. It is understood that after consulting with the President, the principles for selecting Weng's new cabinet have been decided. Those who are reappointed without special circumstances will be asked to remain in their positions to leverage their experience. The Youth Party will retain two ministers and two political councilors. The Democratic Socialist Party will retain one minister and two political councilors. Several prominent members of society will also be appointed as ministers and political councilors. As of midnight on the 25th, the list of the new cabinet was largely finalized, and it is expected that it may be announced on the 26th unless other changes occur. This reporter inquired with reliable sources on the evening of the 25th and learned that Deputy Premier Wang Yunwu will not be reappointed. His successor has not yet been determined, but it is certain that the replacement will be a Northerner. Li Weiguo has been internally appointed as the Secretary-General, but he is currently ill in Nanjing and it is not yet known whether he will accept the position. The deputy secretary-general has not been decided, but it is generally believed that Gu Yuquan and Wu Zhaotang are both possibilities. Regarding the ministries, it is said that Foreign Affairs, Transportation, Land Administration, Industry and Commerce (i.e., the Ministry of Economic Affairs), Agriculture and Forestry, Judicial Administration, Health, Overseas Chinese Affairs, and Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs will all be retained by their current occupants. The Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics is newly established and will be headed by Director-General Xu Kan. Sun Yueqi will succeed Weng himself as the head of the National Resources Commission. He Yingqin will replace Bai Chongxi as the Minister of National Defense. Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun will be reassigned as the Governor of the Central Bank, and a replacement will be selected separately; Jiang Tingfu is considered highly likely. Rumors about Wu Guozhen and Xu Kan are unfounded. Xue Xueshi, the Director of Water Resources, has firmly resigned, and it is said that the position will be held for a recommendation from the Democratic Socialist Party. In addition, the incumbents of the Ministries of Interior, Education, Social Affairs, and Food have all expressed their firm intention to resign and are currently being persuaded to stay. It is said that Hong Lanyou may succeed Zhang Lisheng as Minister of Interior, while Gu Zhenggang's resignation from the Ministry of Social Affairs may be withdrawn. There will still be seven political councilors, with the Nationalist, Youth, and Democratic Socialist parties each having two members and one member from among prominent members of society, or no changes are expected. However, Miao Jiaming has been elected as a legislator, and his vacancy will be filled by selecting another person from among prominent members of society.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] In order to continue the policy of cooperation between the three parties, Weng Wenhao, at the beginning of organizing the new cabinet, especially invited Xu Chuanlin, Zeng Qi, and other responsible persons from the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties for a meeting at 3 PM on the 25th, requesting them to nominate participants for the new cabinet. However, it is reported that the two parties expressed that the cabinet formation should wait until the legislator issue is resolved. Subsequently, Lei Zhen stated that the legislator issue will be gradually resolved, while the cabinet formation must be decided first, and they also agreed to discuss and decide later. It is now known that Xu Chuanlin and others from the Democratic Socialist Party have left for Shanghai on the night train on the 25th to convene a meeting of the party's Central Standing Committee to discuss whether to participate in the Executive Yuan.

### Premier Weng Issues a Statement; The New Executive Yuan Will Continue the Three-Party Cooperation Policy; Restore Social Order and Stabilize People's Livelihoods; Supervise Subordinates to Make Good Use of US Aid

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The newly appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, declared on the 25th that the selection of heads for the various ministries of the new Executive Yuan is actively underway on the 25th, and the announcement will only be made after results have been obtained. The date of the new Executive Yuan's first meeting will also only be determined after the selection of personnel and their appointment by the President. Weng also stated that the new Executive Yuan will continue the three-party cooperation policy, and its personnel will still include members from the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties, as well as non-party individuals. Active consultations are currently being held with the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties.

After the order appointing Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan was announced on the 25th, he held a press conference at the auditorium of the National Resources Commission at 4:30 PM to meet with reporters in his capacity as the new Premier and answer questions. Weng began by saying that in light of the current difficult domestic and international situation, he felt deeply inadequate in talent and overwhelmed by responsibility as he accepted the appointment as the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution. However, having been nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan, he felt a sense of duty and could not decline the appointment. Weng pointed out that at present, while implementing constitutional governance, it is necessary to establish a new government structure in accordance with the Constitution and improve its work efficiency so that it can contribute to the country. At the same time, while it is necessary to mobilize to suppress the rebellion, special efforts must be made to accelerate progress. These two tasks must be carried out in parallel, and responsibility is heavy, requiring fairness, proactivity, and genuine reform. Weng believes that the biggest difficulties at present are currency inflation, rising prices, inconvenient transportation, and reduced production, which have led to difficulties in people's livelihoods. The reason for this is that after eight years of resistance against Japan, the country has not had time to recover and was immediately confronted with the communist rebellion, leading to the current situation. In the future, the government will address these causes, prescribe the right medicine, and try its best to alleviate these difficulties, restore social order as soon as possible, and improve people's lives. Regarding the issue of US aid, Weng explained that the United States, in view of China's economic difficulties, is making its best effort to provide material assistance to China. In his position as Premier of the Executive Yuan, he will supervise his subordinates to make good use of this aid, fully leveraging its effectiveness to alleviate the economic crisis, relieve the people's suffering, and seize this opportunity to seek the country's revival. Weng also said that the President has clearly indicated the major policies upon taking office, and he will work with his colleagues in the government to promote them in the future. At present, our tasks are both numerous and significant, and there are many problems to be solved and many possible difficulties. The Executive Yuan has an unshirkable responsibility, and he will work diligently, regardless of difficulties or personal gain, to live up to the expectations of the people of the country. If he fails to accomplish his mission, he will resolutely step down to conform to the spirit of constitutional government. He hopes that his colleagues in the government will cooperate sincerely and that prominent members of society and public opinion will provide guidance. Specific policy proposals will be announced after the Executive Yuan is formed.

Weng then answered questions from Chinese and foreign reporters. Weng avoided giving direct answers to questions about the selection of personnel for the new Executive Yuan, saying only that everything would be clear after the list of the new cabinet is announced. One reporter asked what the content of the so-called reform was. Weng said that it was too early to talk about the content at this time. One reporter asked whether Weng was satisfied with the previous foreign policy and whether Weng would continue to maintain the past policy or make changes in the future. Weng replied that the basic principle of diplomacy is to safeguard the integrity of national territory and sovereignty. As for specific methods, the international situation is constantly changing, so attention should be paid at all times, and countermeasures should be decided.

### Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng Send Telegrams to Congratulate Premier Weng

[Our Chongqing Dispatch of the 25th] Zhang Qun sent a telegram this morning to congratulate Weng Wenhao, saying: "Premier Weng Yongni of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing: Having read the newspaper and learned that you have been appointed as Premier of the Executive Yuan, I am deeply relieved to be relieved of my duties. You have achieved great academic accomplishments and high moral character, and your appointment to this difficult task is celebrated by the people of the country. I extend my congratulations and wish you well in your new role."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Wu Tiecheng sent a telegram to congratulate Weng Wenhao, saying: "I am delighted to hear that you have been honored as the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution, overseeing the administration of state affairs, and assisting the central government. I look forward to the spirit of harmony in the times. Congratulations."

### "Bread is More Important Than Freedom" Jiang Tingfu Discusses the China Problem in New York; Solutions Should Start with Economics

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Jiang Tingfu, our representative to the UN Security Council, told US reserve officers here that the Chinese government is taking concrete steps to implement land reform to improve the living standards of Chinese farmers. Comparing Russia in 1917 and China in 1948, Jiang said that both countries had a large number of uneducated and poor people, whose primary concern was poverty and hunger, and their need for bread was far greater than their need for freedom. Regarding the differences in land reform between the two countries, Jiang continued, "Russia had large landlords and large industries owned by the aristocracy, but currently China only has small landlords with small properties, so land ownership in China cannot be used as a target of revolution as it was in Russia." Jiang continued that the land reform implemented by the Chinese Communist Party is difficult to implement because the land allocated is very small, so farmers benefit very little. Jiang pointed out that the news about China published in American newspapers and magazines is mostly sensational and rarely gives a fair report on China's achievements and failures. One of China's greatest achievements is the abolition of foreign extraterritoriality in China under the leadership of the Chinese government, a step that has fulfilled the expectations and aspirations of all Chinese people. The audience was very interested in the China problem and asked several questions on the spot, including: (1) How will China's inflation be curbed? (2) What is the trend of eliminating the Communist Party's threat? (3) What is the future of China's industrialization? Jiang answered each of the above questions with a firm and enthusiastic attitude, and the crowd applauded warmly. Jiang's central theory is that the best way to solve China's many problems is to start with economics, and the United States should not be impatient with China's slow progress, because the problems of one country are very different from those of another.

### Jiang Tingfu to Return Home; May be Appointed Minister of Finance

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] It is learned that Jiang Tingfu, our representative to the UN Security Council, will return home in the near future. In Weng Wenhao's new Executive Yuan, it is planned to ask Jiang to serve as Minister of Finance, and Jiang's return home is related to this matter.

### Mo Dehui Tours Scenic Spots; Saying He Will be Appointed Deputy Premier is Inaccurate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] Mo Dehui took the Jinghu train from Nanjing to Zhenjiang at 8 AM on the 25th to tour Jinshan and Jiaoshan, and it is said that he will continue to travel to scenic spots along the Jinghu Railway. Political circles here speculate that Mo may be appointed as Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan, as the President has announced that if the Premier of the Executive Yuan is from the South, the Deputy Premier must be from the North. However, according to reliable sources, this statement is absolutely inaccurate. Mo's trip to scenic spots along the Jinghu Line is likely to indicate that he has not participated in Weng Wenhao's cabinet formation.

### Zhang Qun Flies to Chengdu Today

[Our Chongqing Dispatch of the 25th] Zhang Qun is scheduled to fly to Chengdu on the 26th with Mayor Yang Sen, Director He Beiheng, Counselor Zhou Junliang, and Section Chief Wang Liankui.

### The Legislative Yuan Accepted the First Petition Yesterday; Anhui Students Oppose Li Pinxian

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] The first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution accepted its first petition on the 25th. In the morning, a large number of slogans against Li Pinxian were found on Linsen Road, where the National Assembly Hall of the Legislative Yuan is located. At 9 AM, dozens of Anhui students gathered at the entrance of the hall to petition. The Legislative Yuan appointed four members, including Li Yingsheng, Chen Zifeng, Wu Yunpeng, and Cheng Qibao, to receive them during the meeting, and Cheng reported on the process at 11 AM, stating that the students submitted a petition listing twelve "crimes against Anhui" by Chairman Li Pinxian and requested the Legislative Yuan to forward it to the government for sanctions. A student representative also reported verbally that they had repeatedly voiced their grievances against Li's harsh rule in Anhui to the government and the National Assembly, but the government had never given a clear and concrete response. Today, they specifically petition the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the Constitution, requesting that it uphold justice and forward it to the government for attention. Cheng et al. also believed that the number of petition cases would inevitably increase day by day and suggested appointing someone specifically responsible for receiving petitioners and collecting petitions.

### Fourth Meeting of the Legislative Yuan; Discussing Amendments to the Organization Law; Establishing a Special Committee to Conduct Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] The fourth meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 25th. President Sun presided over the meeting at 9:35 AM. After passing the minutes of the third meeting, four members, including Li Yingsheng, Chen Ziji, Wu Yunpeng, and Cheng Qibao, were elected to represent the Legislative Yuan in receiving Anhui students who were petitioning outside the meeting. Then, they proceeded to discuss agenda items. The meeting agenda listed three proposals from various members: (1) Chen Guyuan et al. proposed amending Articles 4 and 5 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law regarding the organization of various committees. (2) Xu Panjun et al. proposed establishing a Maritime Affairs Committee in accordance with Article 3 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law. (3) Tian Yushi et al. proposed amending Article 19 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law. Then, according to the order of the proposals, the agenda was changed, and Tian's proposal was discussed first. When presenting his proposal, the proposer Tian Yushi first stated that the motivation for the proposal was directed at the law and at the matter, and definitely not at any person. He believed that the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan serves the entire Yuan and is responsible to the entire Yuan. The original Organization Law stipulated that the appointment should be made after the President of the Yuan submits it to the Yuan for decision. The current Organization Law cancels this procedure. According to the custom of various countries and parliamentary procedures, the Secretary-General is elected by the meeting, but now the Legislative Yuan meeting cannot even obtain a resolution of consent, which is inappropriate. In order to ensure that the opinions of the President of the Yuan are respected by the consensus of the members and that the duties of the Secretary-General are fully guaranteed, he proposed restoring the provisions of the original Organization Law. After Tian's explanation, a heated debate arose, and members spoke one after another. At 10:40 AM, the discussion was stopped, and a vote was taken to refer it for review first with the approval of 383 out of 514 members present. Jian Guansan then proposed that each unit nominate one person to form a temporary review committee to summarize everyone's opinions within two days and present them at the Friday regular meeting. However, President Sun's proposal was ultimately adopted to leave this case to the Legislative System Committee for review after its establishment. After a break, the meeting continued, and after listening to Cheng Qibao report on their reception of the petitioning students from Anhui, the discussion of Chen's proposal began. Chen Guyuan explained that the focus of his proposal was to dilute the special status and power of the conveners of the various committees and to prevent the various committees from being difficult to convene due to the excessive number of participants. The members put forward their opinions one after another. As the adjournment time was approaching, President Sun asked whether a special committee could be formed to specifically review matters related to amendments to the Organization Law. This was agreed upon by the members, and it was decided that the organization of the special committee would be discussed at the afternoon meeting. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.

At 3:35 PM in the afternoon, the meeting continued to discuss matters regarding the organization of the special review committee. Zheng Jiajun and others spoke in succession. Finally, President Sun sought the consent of the assembly, stopped the discussion, and summarized the opinions of the various members. Regarding the organization of the special review committee, in addition to the speakers and proposers from the Drafting Committee on the Rules of Procedure at today's meeting, all members can participate freely. The special review committee is scheduled to conduct the review on the afternoons of the 26th and 27th, and the review results will be presented for discussion at the regular meeting on the 28th. This was passed by the Legislative Yuan members present without objection, and all proposals were submitted to the special review committee for review first. The meeting adjourned at 4:20 PM in the afternoon.

### Proposal to Amend the Business Tax Law Submitted to the Legislative Yuan; Will be Discussed at the Next Regular Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] The National Grain Association called on the entire country to exempt grain from business tax. Previously, Pan Gongzhan and 50 other representatives submitted a proposal at the National Assembly requesting the government to issue a clear order to exempt grain from business tax. The proposal was passed by the assembly and sent to the government to order the competent authorities to implement it earnestly.

### President Issues an Order; Convening the Control Yuan; To be Held in the Capital on June 5th

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The President issued the following order on May 26th: The first Control Yuan members produced in accordance with the Constitution will convene in the capital on June 5th, 1948. (Central News Agency Note: The date of the Control Yuan's meeting was originally approved by the President as June 1st based on a signed report by Liu Zhe, the chairman of the preparatory committee for the first Control Yuan. The secretariat of the preparatory committee also received a notice from the Secretary-General of the Presidential Office on the 23rd. However, because the production of the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution was somewhat later than expected, the meeting convening order was only issued on the 26th. To allow Control Yuan members from afar to arrive in Nanjing in time for the meeting, the President changed the meeting date to June 5th).

### Washington Praises Premier Weng; Officials Believe He Will Be Able to Fulfill His Responsibilities Pleasantly; Sufficient to Cooperate with the US Aid to China Plan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th, Associated Press] Here, officials and diplomatic figures have reacted very favorably to President Jiang's appointment of Weng Wen-hao as Premier of the Executive Yuan. They all believe that if Mr. Weng is granted sufficient power, he will certainly be able to fulfill his responsibilities pleasantly and make a great contribution to China. Officials here all know that he is a free-thinking individual, and many American and other national officials who have traveled to China or served in China are very impressed with him. They all believe that Mr. Weng is not only loyal to his country but also proficient in foreign languages and able to get along well with representatives from other countries. Diplomatic figures believe that Weng Wenhao is very familiar with engineering and economic conditions, and the reason why President Jiang selected him as Premier of the Executive Yuan is partly because he believes that he is qualified to cooperate with the US aid to China plan.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 25th] The new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, is probably one of the shortest prime ministers in the world, standing 5 feet tall and weighing only 90 pounds, but his energy is extraordinary, and he can work 15 hours a day without getting tired, partly due to his low blood pressure of 90 degrees and partly due to his simple life. President Jiang's selection of Weng as Premier of the Executive Yuan this time is due to his outstanding administrative talent. For 16 years, he has led the National Resources Commission from its inception to its development into a powerful agency, employing 300,000 people, controlling 98 percent of the country's steel production, 35 percent of coal production, and 65 percent of electricity production, as well as 100 percent of important metals such as tin and iron. Weng has a strong memory and can recall the production tonnage of a certain mine or factory at will. He is quiet, detached, and does not like crowds, but he likes to talk with a few people. Weng is meticulous in handling official affairs, does not like to write flowery prose, but focuses on effectiveness and does not want people to make excuses for shirking responsibility.

Since the Soviet Union disclosed the exchange of letters between the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, and the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, the reactions of various countries have been initially shocked, then disappointed. Within a short period of several days, many changes have occurred.

The complex international situation has shifted quickly, making it difficult to determine whether we should be optimistic or pessimistic. Even personal disagreements are difficult to resolve immediately, let alone conflicts between two major powers on the international stage. However, the international "Cold War" is unlikely to escalate into all-out warfare as easily as a personal feud.

General reactions have been extremely praiseworthy of the Soviet authorities' expressions of their love for peace, while severely criticizing the American authorities for maintaining their current foreign policy and refusing direct negotiations between the two countries, demonstrating that everyone is deeply eager for genuine post-war peace. However, we must understand that before the Soviet Union's expressions of love for peace are concretely demonstrated in action, the current American policy cannot easily be shaken, precisely because the American political system is fundamentally different from that of the Soviet Union. In fact, the Soviet Union's policy has not changed after this exchange of letters; they simply did not need to issue another statement on this point.

America's refusal to continue direct negotiations does not mean that it is unwilling to cooperate; otherwise, why would there have been an exchange of letters in the first place? Marshall's statement that direct negotiations between the two countries would only waste time and delay opportunities is a justifiable reason. As British Foreign Secretary Bevin pointed out, the Soviet Union's sudden announcement of the exchange of letters through TASS has already violated diplomatic precedent and is a means of seeking world sympathy. However, the United States is not suddenly asking the Soviet Union to openly discuss international disputes, only to then refuse to discuss them. The United States is only refusing a negotiating format limited to the US and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union does not seem to have formally stated that it insists on continued negotiations between the two countries.

Allowing the US and the Soviet Union to determine the fate of the world in a conference room is unlikely to be effective, just as it was on the battlefield. The current disputes are not limited to the interests of the two countries themselves, but involve many other countries. If the United States resolutely engaged in individual negotiations with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union actually agreed, critics who are now satirizing the United States for lacking courage would have already risen up in opposition to their collusion and used the interests of other countries as a gamble. We do not support a repetition of the Yalta Conference today, so why criticize the United States for being inconsistent?

However, this statement by the American authorities does not close the door to changes in the international situation. Various United Nations conferences and foreign ministers' conferences provide opportunities for both sides to express compromise and cooperation. Not only the Soviet Union, but any country's expression of love for peace can only be concretely demonstrated in these venues. The tense international situation, from the atomic bomb issue to the Berlin traffic control, are all the evil consequences of the failure of those conferences. Therefore, one of the key factors for the future is the smooth progress of these conferences.

After the exchange of letters between the United States and the Soviet Union, the most recent important news about the Soviet Union is the upcoming change in the duties of Gromyko, the representative to the United Nations, with Malik succeeding him. Regardless of how Gromyko will be promoted or transferred, replacing him with a new person at this time is likely to be a further indication that Soviet policy is indeed preparing for a change of course. Before the new representative's words and actions are confirmed, we should not rashly place too high expectations on this personnel change. However, the future trends should be slightly revealed in the short term.

Several international conferences need to be held successively. In order to determine the future status of the defeated countries and the rights and interests of the victorious countries towards them, only the peace treaty with Italy has been established to be relatively important, and there are still many remaining issues, such as the disposition of Italy's former territories and the establishment or modification of the new system of joint management of the Port of Trieste. A peace treaty with Austria has been drafted but not completed. The conferences on the peace treaties with Germany and Japan, which are most crucial to ending World War II, have been repeatedly delayed and are nowhere in sight. These are important cases that have been suspended for a long time due to the Soviet Union's tougher stance after the establishment of the Romanian and Bulgarian treaties, and the unwillingness of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries to make further concessions. In addition, conferences such as the Danube River Navigation Rights Conference are narrower in scope, but the issues involved are also quite complex.

After every major war, it is normal for the victorious countries to quarrel due to the uneven distribution of spoils. The fundamental goal of participating in a war is not simply self-defense; as far as possible, one always hopes to gain new harvests and strengthen one's own position in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of being invaded. The Soviet Union's efforts to expand its control over Eastern European countries, its refusal to let go of Czechoslovakia, its refusal to withdraw from Lushun and Dalian, and its strengthening of the occupation of North Korea are all under the pretext of safeguarding security. The United States' efforts to promote the reconstruction and unity of Western European countries and its aid to countries such as Greece and Turkey are also under the pretext of safeguarding peace. However, due to the fundamental differences in the political and social systems of the United States and the Soviet Union, there is a deeper level of mutual suspicion. The Soviet Union can suspect that the United States has a conspiracy to encircle it, and the United States can condemn the Soviet Union for having a conspiracy to undermine its markets and incite labor unrest.

The outcome of this war has another characteristic, which is that the defeated countries have already been divided and occupied by the victorious countries. Therefore, preventing the defeated countries from becoming a force that disrupts world peace has ceased to be a common goal for the victorious countries to cooperate. Instead, the victorious countries have increased many suspicions among themselves. The quantity of movable factory equipment that is moved is not fully disclosed; they mutually criticize each other's methods of utilizing immovable resources. Even the Soviet Union suspects that the United States is supporting the industry and commerce of Japan with ulterior motives; and the United States also suspects that the Soviet Union is going to use communist organizations to control the entire territory of Germany. Under this unprecedented new situation, the victorious countries have naturally transformed into mutual infighting, replacing cooperation.

However, under this tense situation, it would be an overestimation to believe that World War III is on the verge of breaking out. The progress of modern international relations and war tools has already made the world nature of major wars more and more extensive. World War III will indeed inevitably break out in the end, but it will certainly not happen in the period after World War II when reconstruction has not yet been completed. Although the Soviet Union maintains the strongest army on the continent and the United States has re-expanded its military after completing demobilization, these are not enough to serve as a harbinger of development; they are merely using military force to strengthen their diplomatic power.

We believe that both the United States and the Soviet Union still yearn for peace, but neither side is willing to easily concede. The Soviet Union has already gained an advantage in controlling Eastern European countries, and in terms of the supply and demand situation of materials in various regions, it cannot support a policy of isolation for long. The United States is using large amounts of materials to win over countries in the East and the West, while at the same time preventing the actions of the Soviet Union everywhere, but it cannot support this for long either. The latter's authorities, in order to win the support of the domestic people, especially need a guarantee of peace. Therefore, the recent exchange of letters between the two countries, and the change in the Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, have gradually shifted the diplomatic positions of the two countries in order to conduct the above-mentioned important conferences. This is a very possible development. If these conferences can reach more appropriate decisions in a relatively harmonious atmosphere, international relations can regain stability. This change is likely to have concrete manifestations in the short term.

As for the way to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union, it does not necessarily require a meeting between the leaders of the two countries. The most convenient way is the resumption of the foreign ministers' conference. The United States' plan to aid the reconstruction of Western Europe is unlikely to be shaken due to the improvement of US-Soviet relations, but it will inevitably be extended to Eastern Europe. The plans to aid Greece, Turkey, and China will also not be entirely shaken, but they will inevitably be modified. World peace between the United States and the Soviet Union may not be realized following this, but we always hope that the coming of world peace can be brought closer as a result of the opening of the US-Soviet deadlock.

### Moving Stories in the Defense of Chengde: Forty Warriors Collectively Sacrificed Their Lives

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 24th] A heroic story of collective suicide by forty people was staged in the defense of Chengde. This story can shock heaven and earth. Two battalions of the light and heavy troops of the National Army stationed at Elephant Nose Mountain were attacked by at least six times their force starting on the 14th of this month. They fought fiercely for three days and nights, killing more than 400 bandits and wounding twice as many. By the 19th, in order to concentrate their forces, they were ordered to transfer their positions. At that time, Sergeant Squad Leader Yan Daozong, Corporal Guo Zhifu, Private Liu Dunmin, and forty soldiers refused to withdraw, willing to stay in place and resist alone, and to lay the groundwork for a counterattack in the future. From then on, they launched a miserable and heroic struggle with the bandits, which lasted for four days. Countless bandits were killed, and their own losses increased daily. No one was slightly afraid. Until the night of the 19th, because of more and more casualties and the exhaustion of ammunition, all the soldiers committed suicide after shouting "Long live the Republic of China!" No one survived intact. After receiving the report, Commander Shi believed that the soldiers' loyal and brave performance of regarding death as home was sufficient to be the light of the country and the glory of the army. In addition to submitting a special case to the Central District for preferential treatment, he also ordered all officers and soldiers of the army to pay the highest respect to the forty warriors, and the whole city flew flags at half-mast to mourn them. This incident has aroused great emotion among the soldiers on the front lines.

### Wang Guipan's Adopted Son Committed Theft; Wang Kejia Arrested in Nanjing; Expressed Deep Remorse in Prison

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] Wang Kejia, the adopted son of Wang Guipan, who was the Chief of the Capital Police Department before the war, and is now the Chairman of the Continental Bank, and who married Dr. Zhang Xiangwen on the 12th of this month, was recently arrested in Nanjing for theft. The evening newspapers of the 25th all published the news of this "Police Chief's Son Becomes a Thief" in a prominent position. Those familiar with the Wang family, including security personnel, were all saddened by the only adopted son's deviation. According to police personnel, Wang Kejia's fraudulent and thieving behavior has become an incorrigible habit for several years. In Chongqing, in addition to habitually "breaking in" and stealing in the hallways, he has also repeatedly used his skills in the Lianglukou highway station area to abduct the travel expenses and baggage of passengers between Chongqing and Chengdu. He was arrested and detained by the detective team for half a year. His adoptive father in Chongqing had long stated that he knew nothing about his reckless behavior and did not care about it. Although he did not publish a statement in the newspaper, there was really no relationship. After the victory, police officers thought that his family environment was wealthy after the restoration, so he would not commit crimes again. Wang Kejia was also introduced by his brother-in-law, Du Zui, the current chief of the Huangpu Branch of the Shanghai Police Department, to work in the East District Cleaning Team. Later, he left after eating empty names. He roamed the capital, once wearing the uniform of Officer Liu of the South District Bureau. Later, he was spotted by Liu in the Dahua Cinema and taken to the West District Police Department, where he was released after being admonished. This spring, he caused trouble at the home of dancer Xiao Jinyu, impersonating an inspector from the Garrison Headquarters. However, he revealed his identity when the badge he wore turned out to be from the 36th year. He took advantage of his escape. Later, the East District Police Department arrested a thief in the Central Hospital, but before he could be interrogated, he escaped. Among the belongings left by the fugitive was a piece of paper with Wang Kejia's handwriting and address. The guard police Tao Kun was held in custody at the Capital District Court for failing to guard the convenience of the late escape. On the morning of the 24th, Wang Kejia and a partner, Chen Songlin, went to the dormitory of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to "break in." Unexpectedly, when they stole a raincoat and shook it out, they were recognized by the guard, arrested together, and sent to the Internal Police Headquarters for temporary custody. Upon hearing the news, the East District Bureau prepared a document on the morning of the 25th to bring them in for questioning without error, and decided to send them to the Capital Police Department on the morning of the 26th for transfer to the District Court for trial. The police were confused as to the reasons for Wang Kejia's lack of proper employment. Wang

### Transporting Metal Subsidiary Coins: Ministry of Finance Grants Freedom

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] During the War of Resistance, the Japanese enemy redeemed and purchased metal subsidiary coins within our territory to use as ordnance materials. To prevent assisting the enemy, the Ministry of Finance stipulated: "Travelers carrying various subsidiary coins and old copper coins within the mainland are strictly prohibited from carrying them privately unless they hold a transport permit issued by the Ministry or a remittance certificate from the Central Bank. Violators, regardless of the quantity, will be treated as contraband." This was telegraphed and announced in February of the 35th year [of the Republic]. Now, due to changing circumstances, the Ministry has decided to abolish the aforementioned telegraph regulations and stipulates that henceforth, people carrying copper coins, cash coins, or other metal subsidiary coins will be allowed to transport them freely, without requiring verification of the Ministry's transport permit or the Central Bank's remittance certificate, unless they intend to destroy them for profit or smuggle them abroad, in which case they will still be punished according to Article 1 of the "Regulations for the Punishment of Offenses Against National Currency." This measure has been reported to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Finance for record and telegraphed to relevant agencies for implementation.

Gu Pan's former wife did not bear a son, so Wang City's family adopted him from a young age. He was quite intelligent, but unexpectedly became so depraved, which is attributed to inherited nature. After the newspaper reporter investigated the facts and circumstances, they visited Wang Kejia and Chen Songlin in the detention room. Wang Kejia was very eloquent and articulate, with a very organized train of thought. He did not deny the crime and had repeatedly wondered if he had a mental illness. However, his conclusion was that the formation of habits and the influence of the environment accounted for a larger proportion. He said that his father had always adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards him, and the security authorities often indulged him because of his father's connections, leading to the present situation. Holding newspaper clippings from various evening papers, he wiped away tears and said that he had caused his father another loss of reputation, expressing extreme remorse. He vowed not to complain about his father anymore. He had gone to Shanghai when his father remarried, intending to repent and start anew, but the family was too busy at the time to allow him to speak, so he returned dejectedly. His cousin intended to help him engage in journalism in Beijing, and the establishment of the "China News Agency" was already on file with the News Bureau of the Ministry of Interior, yet this incident occurred. Chen Songlin, from Changsha, claimed that his brother was currently a battalion commander in the 71st Division. He had studied at the Hunan Provincial Xiangtan Normal School and joined the Youth Expeditionary Force 205th Division. After the victory, he was recommended by the demobilization bureau to the Wuhan University preparatory class, but was later expelled. He drifted to Beijing and went astray due to the pressure of life. Wang Kejia said that he had not eaten for two days. He never stopped wanting to change, but society had no place to accommodate him, and the pressure of life became deeper and deeper. He expressed deep regret and shame towards his father, but eagerly wanted to suffer the punishment he deserved and did not want anyone to be lenient again. He also said: "Please tell all young people in the world, never make a mistake, one wrong step and you can't go back." He felt quite lost about his future after being released from prison.

They said that the entire county had become a swamp, and the early rice was completely hopeless. The late rice also needs to be judged based on the receding of the river water. If it cannot recede by one zhang within ten days, there is no hope for planting late rice. At present, the poor people in Binhu are all empty-handed. Not only is there no rice flour to cook, but there is also a shortage of rice seeds. They hope that Mao will investigate the disaster and give a light loan of seeds to seek the remediation of late rice under the possible situation.

### In Memory of General Dai Anlan

— Du Weiming

The winds and clouds over the Pacific ignited the flames of the expedition to Burma. Our Chinese heroes, in a heroic posture, appeared on the unprecedented battlefield. The National Army extended assistance righteously, fighting alongside the Allied forces. This can be said to be a historic feat! General Dai Anlan led the 200th Division of the Army as the vanguard of the National Army, opening the way for this expedition and displaying the ability to attack and defend, providing safe and powerful cover for the 100,000-strong expeditionary force, allowing them to penetrate into foreign countries to achieve the greatest strategic objective and alleviate the crisis of the Allied forces. It can also be said that it was the most glorious page in the history of our army's resistance against Japan, completed under all difficult conditions! But unfortunately, during the transfer of battles, he was wounded and died heroically while breaking through the enemy's encirclement. Time is as fast as lightning, and in the blink of an eye, it has come to the sixth anniversary of General Dai's heroic death, which makes us, on this day of commemoration, recall the past with endless sadness and pain!

General Dai Anlan's heroic sacrifice occurred on May 26, 1942 [Gregorian calendar]. During the expedition, he resolutely defended Toungoo, rushed to the aid of Chokepaduang, and captured Taunggyi. Just as he was preparing to participate in the Battle of Debre, the British army unexpectedly withdrew automatically, and the rear route on the left flank was cut off. The General was ordered to retreat and rushed overnight. The areas he passed through were all towering mountains and desolate areas. There were no people and no food. All highways, rivers, mountain passes, and key roads were guarded by the Japanese in advance. The General disregarded his own safety, fought bravely while wounded, and the entire division was of one mind, vowing to destroy the Japanese pirates. They broke through five heavily guarded passes one after another, completing the mission of returning the entire division, but he died of his wounds in Mao Bang Village, Burma. When I heard the news of his heroic death, I was marching in the foothills of the uninhabited Hukawng Valley in northern Burma, fighting the enemy while suffering from the encroachment of miasma and rain. Although I did not encounter large enemies or fierce beasts and poisonous snakes, there were countless ants, mosquitoes, and leeches in the primeval forest, enough to kill people. I watched thousands upon thousands of soldiers struggling with hunger, suffering from malaria, and being sucked dry by leeches. What's more, flies, gnats, and ants gathered and sucked, leaving the heroic soldiers helpless. Even if they fell to the ground, they would be turned into withered bones within a few hours after being sucked by these small insects. This kind of tragic scene is simply indescribable. Thinking of the General's experiences before and after his injury, it was the same as this, truly tragic and heartbreaking, leaving me wanting to cry but having no tears. In addition, camping in desolate mountains, secluded valleys, and primeval forests made it impossible to summon his soul and hold a memorial ceremony, making me feel even more guilty and unable to excuse myself!

I worked with General Zhan for the longest time and knew him the deepest. He had a majestic appearance and a resolute personality. His attitude seemed aloof and unrestrained, but his heart was extremely sensitive and full of affection. In the process of interacting with him, I regarded him as a beneficial friend who could correct each other's mistakes and a comrade-in-arms who could share weal and woe. As early as when we were colleagues at the military academy, we were still young. His aura of looking down on the crowd and his shrewd and capable talent had already left a very deep impression on my mind. I felt that he was an extraordinary talent. Sometimes, when we discussed ancient and modern times, he rarely approved of people, but he had a style of taking responsibility, knowing shame, and not avoiding labor and resentment, showing his ambition to shoulder heavy responsibilities and go far. After the military academy, we each embarked on our respective journeys. He showed amazing achievements in suppressing bandits in Henan and Anhui, resisting Japan at the Great Wall, and in the early stages of the War of Resistance, such as the Battle of Taierzhuang. When he was transferred to the 200th Division, the reunion of old friends was like a new life. I was happy to have someone who could carry on the past, and General Dai was also happy to have the opportunity to work together again, which further increased our spirit of moving forward bravely and our belief in killing enemies and serving the country. It was not until later that I saw his poem when he set out for Burma, "A whip points to flowers like promised, Zhuge's past life is coming again," that I knew that this talented and courageous person was a worshiper of Zhuge Wuhou, but his fate was the same as Zhuge Wuhou, and it made people feel the sigh of "he died before he could accomplish his mission, and it made heroes' tears fill their clothes!"

General Dai's management of the army was strict and his training was effective. He was able to put into practice Chairman Chiang's instructions of "high skills and great resistance," studying the codes carefully and teaching while fighting, making the 200th Division harmonious and united, with everyone of one mind. The technology was skilled, and officers and soldiers were integrated. Not only did the Military Affairs Commission inspection consider it the best in the country, but the Battle of Kunlun Pass especially demonstrated the achievements of its training, setting a precedent for turning from defense to offense since the War of Resistance, and achieving the effect of attacking strongholds, overcoming dangers, and gathering and annihilating stubborn enemies. He braved the summer heat to go on an expedition to Burma. He traveled east and west for several months, conquering every attack and solidifying every defense, carrying out his tasks and not shirking from difficulties, further displaying his military genius and showing his military virtue. This is not "catering to his preferences." Anyone familiar with the achievements of our army probably feels the same. General died at the young age of 38, he had not yet seen the victory of the War of Resistance, nor had he completed the great cause of national construction, which makes us feel endless sorrow in addition to admiration. And I and the General have been together for more than ten years, like milk and water, with feelings like brothers, but we were broken halfway through. What a trauma this is. Looking around today, the Central Plains is boiling and the war is urgent. "Hearing the drums makes me think of generals and commanders." General's early death feels like an irreparable loss to the country. The heroes of the nation have passed away with the wheels of the times. In mourning the dead and considering the future, I cannot help but feel a sense of independence. However, General Dai's loyalty and achievements stand tall in the mountains and rivers, shining on the sun and the moon. Their brilliance is dazzling, shocking the past and shaking the present, and it is enough to strengthen our confidence and encourage our courage. We will continue to follow in General Dai's footsteps with sweat and hesitation, and then complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.

Dai's Coffin Buried in Wu

[This newspaper Wuhu 25th dispatch] Dai Anlan, the late division commander, was originally scheduled to be buried on May 26, the sixth anniversary of his heroic death in Burma, but because the state funeral had not yet been approved, Generals Du Yuming and Xu Tingyao will not come to Wu for the time being. His family members were afraid that the coffin would be left unattended for too long, so they hastily buried it a few days ago, and will hold a ceremony later after the government approves the funeral.

### Just Like the Czech Incident: Finnish Communists Brew Coup: Announce the Establishment of the National Action Committee: Inciting a General Strike Under the Pretext of Dismissing the Interior Minister

[United Press International, Helsinki, 24th] Workers across Finland went on strike on the 24th to protest the government's decision to remove the communist interior minister, Laine. This communist tactic is exactly the same as that adopted in the Czech coup three months ago. As the Finnish capital was shocked by the launch of communist tactics, the Finnish cabinet held an emergency meeting. The seriousness of the situation was unprecedented, and there was a risk of it evolving into a full-scale communist attempt to seize power and force Finland to join the Soviet "Iron Curtain" group.

[Reuters, Helsinki, 24th] The Finnish People's Democratic Party, formed by the merger of the Finnish Communist Party and the left-wing Social Democratic Party, brewed a general strike to coerce the government into appointing a member of the People's Democratic Party to succeed the Interior Minister before the party formed an "Action Committee" today to "lead and unify national actions to ensure that the government's lineup does not change before the general election." A non-communist cabinet member told this agency that "We know what the Communist Party's plan is and will never allow it to be implemented. The police have been ordered to be on alert, and the army is also staying in the barracks." Due to the stalemate between President Paasikivi and the People's Democratic Party over the selection of the Interior Minister, Helsinki is on the eve of a storm tonight, and there is a risk of open unrest and street fighting breaking out. The People's Democratic Party has organized strikes across the country, saying that if the President does not appoint a member of the People's Democratic Party to replace the current Interior Minister Kirpil of the Democratic Social Party and fill the currently vacant post of Foreign Vice Minister, they will launch a nationwide general strike tomorrow. They also threatened to "surround" the government building on the 25th when the President convenes the cabinet to decide on the candidates for Interior Minister and Foreign Vice Minister. The immediate cause of the crisis was the dismissal of Communist Interior Minister Laine after being impeached by the parliament. When the parliament met last week, it confirmed that Laine had illegally extradited two Finnish nationals and ten stateless people to the Soviet Union in 1945, and passed a motion to impeach Laine.

The People's Democratic Party ordered its members across the country to launch strikes today as a prelude to the general strike on the 25th. The strike by dockworkers in Helsinki has prevented 34 ships scheduled to be exported this morning from being exported, and other ports have also been affected. At the same time, the "Trade Union Association," which is dominated by the Social Democratic Party, passed a resolution with 162 votes against 141, declaring that the strikes that occurred today disregarded the authority of the trade union, intended to cause political unrest, and were clearly contrary to democratic procedures. The organization of the Action Committee was announced today by Koro, Chairman of the People's Democratic Party. The party's newspaper, "Vapaa Sana," said that Paasikivi's refusal to restore Laine to his post was using the methods of the Czech reactionaries. Laine himself addressed a People's Democratic Party conference attended by 30,000 people today, saying that his dismissal and the events caused by it were the result of the reactionary forces' attack on democracy. He firmly demanded that the People's Democratic Party take over the post of Interior Minister. The audience at the scene shouted for Laine's reinstatement and vowed to achieve this goal by force. According to recent news, the Social Democratic Party is putting pressure on workers in various factories and shops to resume work.

### The U.S. Ignores the Soviet Union's Use of Veto Power and Still Investigates the Czech Coup

[Reuters Lake Success 25th dispatch] U.S. Representative to the Security Council Austin issued a statement today, stating that the United States will not heed the 24th and 25th vetoes used by the Soviet Union in the Security Council, but will obtain testimony from Czech politicians in exile in the United States to assist the United Nations organization in investigating the Czech coup in February of this year.

Soviet Representative Gromyko used the veto power twice in the Security Council yesterday to prevent the United Nations investigation. Austin's statement emphasized that Wan Romico's use of the veto power was not enough to eliminate the cause of the investigation and was a complete abuse of the veto power. It pointed out that such investigations were essential, and the United States would not stop providing support for investigations due to Gromyko's opposition. His statement "We will obtain the testimony of Czech politicians in exile in the United States after the February coup in the Czech Republic, and we hope that other governments can do the same." Gromyko used the veto power twice in the Security Council yesterday. The first time was when the Chilean proposal to the Security Council to investigate the Czech coup was voted on. Nine votes were in favor, and two votes were against (the Soviet Union and Ukraine). The Soviet Union's vote against was a veto. The second time was when the vote on whether the Chilean case was applicable to the veto power. Eight votes were in favor of the inapplicability, and the Soviet Union overturned it with the veto power. This was the first time Gromyko had used the veto power since he vetoed Italy's accession to the United Nations on April 30. After Gromyko used the veto power for the second time, Austin stood up and condemned the Soviet Union's attitude in strong terms, and British Representative Cadgan also expressed that Gromyko's two uses of the veto power were making a joke of the San Francisco Charter.

### 500,000 Yen to Exit Higashi-Mazushima

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Would you like to buy an empire for 500,000 yen? Japan is currently selling one such empire. This tiny country is Higashi-Mazushima Island, which covers an area of one square mile. The island is located one mile north of Rebun Island, where Japanese and American scientists recently observed the solar eclipse. The island's owner, Juichi Fukui, said that countless sea elephants gather near the island every autumn and winter, and the waters around it are rich in herring roe. One of the reasons why the island's owner wants to sell the island at a low price of 500,000 yen is that it is very close to Sakhalin Island in Soviet Russia.

### Ma Qing Opposes Amending the Trade Without Agreement

### British Plane Near Ryukyu Mistakenly Intercepted; U.S. Expresses Apology to Britain

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] The U.S. Far East Air Forces Command announced today that last Saturday, a four-engine aircraft of British Overseas Airways, flying from Japan to Hong Kong, deviated from its route and was discovered by U.S. fighter planes near Ryukyu Island. Considering it a plane of unknown nationality, it was ordered to change course. The British plane did not comply, so several bursts of machine-gun fire were used to urge its attention. The British plane then turned towards Ryukyu and contacted the U.S. Air Forces Command by radio, proving its nationality, after which it continued flying to Hong Kong. The acting commander of the U.S. Far East Air Forces, Wylde, has formally expressed his apology to the head of the British Liaison Mission in Japan.

### Six-Nation Negotiations on the German Question to Face Final Stage; France Intends to Request Military Guarantees from the U.S.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The French representative attending the Six-Nation Conference returned to Paris last weekend to confer with French Foreign Minister Bidault and returned to London this morning at 11:00 a.m. to continue discussions on the German question. It is reported that the final stage of the negotiations will begin tomorrow.

[United Press, London, 24th] It is heard that France will request the United States to guarantee military assistance to the Western European Union as a condition for supporting the American reconstruction of German industry. It is heard that the French delegation participating in the Six-Nation Conference has obtained the support of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and has agreed in principle to the establishment of an independent government in West Germany and the expansion of its economic autonomy. However, it also requests the United States to guarantee military assistance in the event that any country in the Western European Alliance is attacked.

### Soviet Union Closely Watches Developments of the Conference

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] German political figures close to the Soviet military government stated that Soviet Army Commander-in-Chief in Germany Sokolovsky will return to Moscow with his main advisors to consult with the Soviet government after the results of the Six-Nation Conference in London discussing the German question are announced. Marshal Sokolovsky has been in contact with Moscow regarding the daily announcements of the conference since its beginning. Sources familiar with German affairs believe that if the communique of the London Conference to be issued this weekend contains an indication that a West German government will be established, the Soviet Union will most likely reapply great pressure in Berlin, forcing Britain, the United States, and France to withdraw from Berlin and preparing for the establishment of an East German state. These sources point out that the so-called Berlin Crisis has not ended, and the current lull in Soviet pressure is due to the ambiguity of the resolutions of the London Conference. If Sokolovsky's departure for Moscow closely follows the publication of the London Conference communique, the most serious tensions between the Eastern and Western powers regarding the German question are expected to be revealed.

### Bevin Meets with U.S. Ambassador; Seeking a Common Path to a Solution; Arabs May Submit Ceasefire Response Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast. Today, British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas for the third time in four days to discuss the Palestine issue. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office told reporters that Britain and the United States are discussing common steps to seek a solution to the Palestine issue. It is expected that Bevin will soon return to the House of Commons to issue a statement.

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: Cairo news. Today, representatives of five Arab countries held a meeting to discuss the UN's ceasefire appeal. It is generally believed that the possibility of Arab countries accepting this appeal is very small. The fate of Jerusalem is still undecided. The New City is still in the hands of Jewish forces. Jordanian troops launched a fierce attack today, but were repelled. If there is a ceasefire at the present time, the Jewish side will still be able to retain the New City of Jerusalem. The Arab side's demand is that the Jewish army lay down its arms and surrender unconditionally.

[U.S. Information Service, Lake Success, 24th] At the request of the Arab countries, the United Nations Security Council tonight extended the deadline for the ceasefire appeal in Palestine by 48 hours. Representatives of Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon notified the Security Council that the Arab countries involved in the Jewish-Arab conflict in the Holy Land needed more time to consider the ceasefire appeal. The Security Council did not oppose the extension. This request was approved approximately seven hours after the original ceasefire deadline set by the Security Council expired. The new deadline is 4:00 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on Wednesday (the 26th) (1:00 a.m. on Thursday, China Coastal Summer Time). Israel has accepted the original ceasefire appeal and is only awaiting the agreement of the Arab side. Syrian representative El-Khouri told the Security Council that the Political Committee of the Arab League would meet in Amman (Transjordan) on the 25th to discuss the UN's ceasefire appeal. He hoped that the Arab side's response would arrive at Lake Success by noon on Wednesday (the 26th). France once again requested the Security Council to take steps to protect the holy sites of Jerusalem from destruction.

[Reuters, London, 24th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain has decided to support the Arab countries' request to the Security Council for a 48-hour extension of the ceasefire deadline in Palestine. Britain has strongly urged the Arab countries to accept the ceasefire proposal, but believes that the Arab countries should be given more time for consideration.

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] The State Department recently announced that the United States has formally notified all Arab countries, stating that the United States is deeply troubled by the situation in Palestine and earnestly hopes that all Arab countries will accept the Security Council's ceasefire order.

### U.S. Congressman Proposes Sending Troops to Lebanon; Urging Lebanon to Release Arrested American Jews

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Lebanon's refusal to release 41 Americans arrested last week while en route to Palestine has caused the State Department to hold meetings all day, but no quick solution has been reached. According to diplomatic circles, the United States will not yield on the demand for the release of the detainees. The United States will issue a warning and, if necessary, accuse Lebanon before the Security Council, urging it to release the American people. Congressman Seller told the House of Representatives that what is needed is military action rather than diplomatic action. Seller requested the Navy Department to send warships and Marines to Lebanon to urge Lebanon to release the Americans.

Weizmann acknowledged that part of the loan would be used for military purposes, as the Jewish side lacks arms.

### Will Britain Use U.S. Aid to Support the Arabs? Hoffman Testifies Before the U.S. Senate

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Paul Hoffman, administrator of the European Recovery Program, was summoned to the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 25th to report on whether U.S. aid had enabled Britain to arm the Arabs to fight against Israel. Hoffman's appearance before the Appropriations Committee may trigger a major issue, namely whether the United States can use the Recovery Fund to force European countries to make political concessions. Burr told reporters that Averell Harriman, the overseas director of the Recovery Program, would also be questioned about this matter on the 25th.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that the French representative in Amman has requested King Abdullah to order his Arab Legion to honor the Security Council's ceasefire order. The French government has also made a similar appeal to Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok.

### No Major Battles in Palestine; Jews in the Old City of Jerusalem Still Resisting Stubbornly from Underground; British Authorities Announce Blockade of Haifa Port

[United Press, Cairo, 24th] There were still battles in Jerusalem and other parts of Palestine today, but generally speaking, the scale is gradually decreasing.

[Reuters, London, 25th] The latest battle situation on the Palestinian fronts is as follows: Jerusalem: More than 1,000 Jews trapped in the Old City of Jerusalem, with 600 killed in the civil war, are still fighting to the death from ruins and underground passages. The Arab forces intend to starve them out, so their advance is very slow.

Jewish forces in the New City of Jerusalem tried again to break into the Old City but failed. In the New City, Arab forces have surrounded the Notre Dame Monastery and are advancing and retreating from the Barklay's Bank under heavy fire. The area around Hebrew University and Hadassah Hospital is very quiet. The Haganah said that the Arab forces have made no progress in the New City. In the village of Rachel, five miles southeast of Jerusalem, Jewish forces repelled a fierce Arab attack and captured a large amount of military supplies. Southern Front: The Haganah admitted that the Jewish area of Yad Mordechai, north of Gaza, was occupied by Egyptian forces after a day of fierce fighting. Jewish planes raided military targets in Majdal, north of Gaza. A Tel Aviv bulletin announced that the city of Jaffa was bombed by Egyptian planes for the first time, and a mosque was hit. A Cairo bulletin said that Egyptian planes attacked the Ramat Gan industrial area near Tel Aviv and hit explosives and fuel depots.

[Reuters, Haifa, 25th] British authorities have ordered the blockade of Haifa Port, prohibiting all ships from entering. Jews immediately protested upon hearing the news, as two Jewish ships carrying 1,200 Jews from the island of Cyprus were scheduled to arrive in Haifa today. The two ships were originally scheduled to dock at Tel Aviv, but diverted to Haifa for fear of bombing by Egyptian aircraft.

### Report on Aid to China by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee

[U.S. Information Service, Washington News] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee released its revised report on China on March 30. The summary is as follows:

The future of Asia is closely related to the development of China.

Due to the traditional friendship between our two nations, China's difficulties evoke deep sympathy in the United States, especially at this critical juncture when China is an important part of the anti-communist front.

There are several favorable factors. China is still able to be self-sufficient in food and raw materials. China has a large and valuable labor force. Among the politically conscious people, there is a strong sentiment in favor of a democratic government. China has great achievements and respect for the constructive values of civilization.

On the other hand, China's economy has been greatly damaged by eight years of war against Japan and the subsequent civil war, including the destructive tactics used by the communists. China has never developed a favorable trade balance, and in the past few years, the unfavorable trade balance has clearly worsened. China faces extremely difficult and complex tasks, and the position of American cooperation is not easy to determine. However, the current recommendations are clearly justified by the current facts, and the self-help proposals made by the National Government (see Section 18) are worthy of our cooperation.

(A) Political Environment

Since 1928, the National Government has been controlled by the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party). The party has taken preliminary steps, announcing a constitution and electing a National Assembly, moving towards democracy. At the same time, the goal of the Chinese Communist Party is a totalitarian government. The CCP's propaganda is strongly anti-American, disregarding all American policies and following the Moscow line. China currently seems to have social and political factors and ideals that can expand and increase the political appeal and leadership of the National Government, thereby combating the openly rebellious Communist Party.

In the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 1945, the Soviet Union pledged to support only the National Government, which is recognized by all countries as the legitimate government of China. The Soviet Union has not provided the National Government with the "material resources" stipulated in the treaty. On the contrary, the Soviet Union removed a large amount of industrial equipment from factories in the Northeast, the value of which is feared to reach as much as 2 billion U.S. dollars. (See Appendix C)

(B) Economic Crisis

Since the defeat of Japan, China's economy has gradually deteriorated. The destruction of transportation has isolated material and consumer centers and ports. There is a food shortage of 2 million tons next year, mostly due to the civil war. The cost of the civil war has increased the government's expenditures, and the rapid inflation hinders production and distribution, and stimulates speculation and hoarding. The amount of paper money issued has increased more than eight times since 1947. In mid-March, the value of the U.S. dollar on the black market was about 450,000 legal tender annually. Seventy percent of the government's expenditures are used for military purposes, and tax revenue is less than one-third of the government's total expenditures. Private individuals in China own about $500 million in gold, foreign exchange, and foreign currency, but the Chinese government finds it extremely difficult to mobilize these resources. Overseas remittances from overseas Chinese have decreased significantly, and China's official foreign exchange reserves are dwindling, so that it will soon be unable to purchase the imports necessary for the basic civilian economy.

Valuable resources, such as coal and food in rural areas, are under Communist control. The stated goal of the CCP is to cause China's economic collapse.

(C) Population and Regions Under CCP Control

According to rough estimates, as of March 15, 1948, the area controlled by the CCP accounted for 25% of the entire China, and the population controlled accounted for 33% of the entire China, about 150 million people.

Due to the fluid nature of military operations and the constant changes in the areas controlled by the Chinese government and the CCP, it is impossible to provide accurate estimates. The strength of the CCP armed forces is estimated as follows: 1.15 million regular troops, 2 million local militia. Approximately six months ago, the Chinese government publicly announced the strength of its armed forces as 3.8 million people.

Previous Aid to China

The State Department submitted the following estimates of previous aid to China to the committee:

Since 1937, U.S. economic, financial, and military assistance to China has been as follows:

Before the Victory over Japan

Export-Import Bank loan of $120 million, 1942 Congressional loan of $500 million, Lend-Lease materials of $849.4 million, totaling $1.4694 billion.

After the Victory over Japan: (Lend-Lease) Military $728 million, Civilian goods loan of $49.6 million, Naval aid $17.7 million, (Surplus materials loan) Foreign Liquidation Commissioner's Office dockyard loan of $4 million, Huaxi loan of $20 million, Maritime Commission loan approved for $16.5 million, Export-Import Bank loan of $82.8 million. (UNRRA) 72% of the American donations used for aid to China (plus freight and insurance) $465.8 million, donations to the UNRRA Custodial Committee materials and funds $4.7 million, American Relief for Foreign Countries program $45.7 million, United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund $2.1 million, totaling $1.4369 billion, total of $2.9063 billion.

Since the sale of some surplus materials is not included in the above total, the State Department supplemented the committee with the following additional figures in its February 19 letter to the Chairman:

The State Department insisted that it was impossible to obtain the total amount of surplus materials transactions, because in some respects, surplus items are still being transferred, and before the transfer work is completed, the total value of the items cannot be accurately determined. Therefore, the above figures are only estimates in some respects.

The Committee agrees that this aid situation further confirms America's fundamental and traditional concern for China's interests. (To be continued)

### A Disturbance Caused by Rongjun in Eastern Shanghai; More Than a Dozen Soldiers and Police Wounded or Missing; Police Squad Headquarters Smashed, Losing Five Firearms; Relevant Authorities Conferred All Night on Handling the Aftermath

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 7:30 p.m. last night at the intersection of Dinghai Road and Pingliang Road in Yangshupu, a conflict occurred between Rongjun and the police. The situation was serious for a time, causing the surrounding residents to panic. Three police officers from the Yangshupu Police Station, five police officers from the Police Squad, and one naval soldier passing by were injured on the spot. At the same time, the doors, windows, and chairs of the Police Squad headquarters were also smashed. It was later discovered that the police lost four rifles and one handgun during the chaos, and two police officers on duty at the police station were missing. The cause of this unfortunate incident was that four wounded soldiers were dissatisfied with the answers given by the police officers when they asked for directions, which led to the conflict. Later, more than 200 Rongjun from the 20th Wounded Soldiers Hospital on Meizhou Road arrived and smashed the Police Squad headquarters, causing a great uproar. As for the aftermath, a major Zhou, deputy adjutant from the Garrison Headquarters, Wang, company commander of the Military Police, Ye Qiu-shen from the Joint Logistics Supply Bureau, Wang, squad leader of the Police Squad, Ding, instructor of the Wounded Soldiers Hospital, and Wang Wei-zhou, chief of the Yangshupu Police Station, and Gao, deputy chief, conferred all night on how to handle the situation.

The incident originated when Rongjun Wang Feng-ming, after having dinner at the Da Zhonghua Hotel at about 6 p.m. yesterday, was slightly intoxicated and, while passing the Jianguo Theater on Dinghai Road, entered the theater on a whim. He happened to meet his companions Luo Jin-tang, Ji De-chang, and Han Chang-de. After sitting for a while, the four of them got up to return to the 20th Wounded Soldiers Hospital on Meizhou Road. When they arrived at the intersection of Dinghai Road and Pingliang Road, they met police officer Zhang Qing-tao and asked where they could take a streetcar to Meizhou Road. Zhang replied that because he was not a police officer on duty at the police station, he did not know the details. The Rongjun thought that the answer was unhelpful and deliberately made things difficult, and a conflict arose in the language. Then, they used their iron canes to beat Zhang Qing-tao. At that time, police officers Li Jun and Zhao Zi-ying from a nearby police booth witnessed this and came out to mediate, but they were also attacked by the Rongjun. Li's left forehead was cracked for more than an inch and he fell to the ground injured, while Zhao was injured in the waist. Many passersby who were watching felt indignant and helped the police officers take the four Rongjun who caused the trouble to the Yangshupu Police Station. Unexpectedly, at this time, the 20th Wounded Soldiers Hospital learned that four Rongjun had been detained by the police station, so they gathered more than 200 Rongjun and set off to rescue them. The team marched mightily and aggressively. When passing the headquarters of the First Squad of the First Battalion of the Second Police Brigade on Pingliang Road and Ningwu Road, the Rongjun mistook it for a police station and rushed in. Li Guo-mei, the guard on duty at the gate, was the first to bear the brunt and was beaten and injured. The police were caught off guard and did not know where the disaster came from. In a short time, doors, windows, tables, and chairs had been destroyed. Squad leader Zhou Gui-sheng, in order to prevent the situation from escalating, immediately ordered the police officers not to fire and went out to inquire about the reason from the Rongjun. However, in the chaos, he and police officers Jia Hong-ji, Wang Zhi-gao, and Yao Jie were also beaten and injured. At this point, the Rongjun dispersed in a hubbub. Before leaving, they kidnapped Zhou, Jia, and Wang. Afterwards, the police整理內部始又發現短少步槍四枝及手槍一枝, At the same time, the Yangshupu Police Station also found that Lu Hao, the police officer on duty at the Ningguo Road station, and Ka Jin-kang, the guard on duty at the Meizhou Road police station, were missing after the Rongjun returned to the hospital. In addition, one unfortunate person was accidentally injured. When the Rongjun were causing trouble, naval soldier Jiang Yong-zhong happened to be passing by. Because he was wearing a yellow uniform, he was mistaken for a police officer by the Rongjun, and his head and chest were beaten. All the injured were sent to the Police Hospital for treatment, but police officer Li Jun's injuries were so severe that his life was in danger.

### City Finances Approaching Serious Stage; Accelerating Tax Collection; Piloting Simplified Tax Collection

[Report from Our Newspaper] To understand the city's financial revenue and expenditure situation, the reporter visited the director of the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday. He was told that since April, the cost of living index for civil servants has been adjusted monthly instead of quarterly, and expenditures have suddenly increased sharply. The total expenditure for May was about 630 billion yuan. However, in recent months, the collection of all taxable taxes has been stepped up, so the difficult situation in May can be barely overcome. However, the revenue and expenditure for June are feared to be impossible to balance. The only remedy is to borrow funds from relevant financial institutions to make up for the deficit.

In the face of the current difficult situation, the only way is to urge and accelerate the collection of all taxable taxes. For example, the business tax, which accounts for 40% of the total tax revenue, has collected 70-80% of the amount due in spring. On the other hand, tax revenue is being rectified, and simplified tax collection methods are planned to be piloted. Under the existing tax collection method, merchants must declare their business turnover tax. After the bureau reviews it, it issues a payment slip, and merchants pay taxes based on it. Time, procedures, and manpower cannot avoid waste. The simplified method is to first determine the standard quarterly business turnover of the city's 70,000 tax collection targets. This will be used as the base, and the tax payable in each subsequent quarter will be calculated based on the rate of increase or decrease in prices in each quarter, without the need for review and other procedures. The determination of the standard business turnover will be done by the Finance Bureau with reference to the past declarations of each merchant. After dividing the total business turnover of each industry, the trade associations will be responsible for dividing the business turnover of each member merchant and sending a list of base numbers to the bureau. The Finance Bureau will use this as the basis for collecting the quarterly business tax. This simplified tax collection principle was once discussed by a small review committee composed of four institutions: the Municipal Government, the Finance Bureau, the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The second small group meeting will be held soon, and there will be some conclusions after the meeting. It is believed that simplified tax collection can rectify tax revenue, but it is still being piloted. Those in various industries who are dissatisfied with the new method can still declare and pay taxes according to the original tax collection method.

### Estimated Increase in This Month's Index by About 40%

### Stall Vendors at Four Major Railway Stations Petition to Overturn Negotiation Records; Railway Bureau Expresses Determination Not to Accept

[Our Newspaper News] The Railway Bureau decided last year to take back the stalls at the four major railway stations of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang and operate them itself. It has repeatedly consulted with representatives of the stall vendors at each station, and on March 5th of this year, both parties agreed to record stipulations that the vendors would be transferred to other smaller stations or reassigned as railway bureau cleaners. Those who were young and met the railway's standards were selected to become service staff at the stations, and were required to cease operations by March 15th. The Railway Bureau also dispatched trained service staff to the four stations to replace them. On the 22nd of this month, over thirty representatives of stall vendors from the four stations suddenly came to Shanghai to petition the Railway Bureau, requesting permission to maintain the current system and continue operations, and their attitude was firm. The Railway Bureau believed that someone must be directing them from behind the scenes.

### Stray Dogs in Cages Await Their Final Fate; Those Unclaimed by the Deadline Will Be Put to Death by Gas

[Our Newspaper Special] Behind the Jiangxi Road Police Precinct is a "dog prison," where over a hundred dogs are kept. They were captured on the streets by the police's dog-catching team and are awaiting their owners to claim them. Stray dogs without licenses are put to death by gas.

A reporter visited the "dog prison" yesterday. In a dark, damp, dirty, and narrow little room, over a hundred dogs were locked up. As soon as you stepped through the door, there was a foul odor. The dogs were kept in square wire cages and barked wildly when they saw someone enter. Many owners can quickly identify their beloved dogs by their barks.

The dogs in the prison are fed a thin beef porridge once a day. The "dog prison" authorities buy 1.1 million yuan worth of beef every day and cook it into two large pots of thin porridge, which is fed to the dogs at 9:00 AM. They are given tap water once at 4:00 PM. The caged dogs are mostly thin and bony due to malnutrition. Fortunately, domestic dogs are sure to be reclaimed by their owners in a short period of time, while stray dogs are destined to die sooner or later.

Selling Dog Skin To Subsidize Food Costs Once a dog is captured, licensed dogs are kept for seven days, and unlicensed dogs are kept for four days. If no one claims them within the deadline, they are considered stray dogs and are either put to death or given away. The place where stray dogs are put to death is a metal box about five feet wide and two feet deep, which can hold over ten dogs at a time. It is equipped with a gas pipe and can kill the dogs within three minutes. After being poisoned by the gas, the dog's entire body turns black. The meat cannot be eaten, but the dog skin can be sold for money. The price of each dog skin is equivalent to about one sheng of rice, and the income from the dog skins is used to subsidize the food costs of the dog-catching team members.

There are twenty staff members at the "dog prison," and the person in charge is Zhang Jing. The dog-catching team has four groups, each with four people. They all go out every day and catch an average of forty to fifty dogs per day. There are also two clerical staff who are responsible for cleaning the "dog prison." The "dog prison" must be scrubbed twice a day and sprayed with a large amount of disinfectant, otherwise it is simply impossible to enter.

Dizzy and Head Spinning, They Surrender

Wang Jinyou, the leader of the dog-catching team, has been catching dogs for over forty years. He shared his experience with reporters: "The best way to catch a dog is to grab its hind legs, then pick it up and make it spin around vigorously. This will make it dizzy and head spinning, and it will surrender." He said that they catch dogs by hand, and sometimes they are bitten if they are not careful. Over the decades, they have gotten used to it and don't even consider it an issue. He held out his hand to show the reporter, covered with scars. He said that it would heal on its own in a day or two, but he was afraid of rabid dogs, which required injections if they bit.

With a Compassionate Heart

For them, catching dogs has long become commonplace, but the dog catchers have a compassionate heart. They hope that every dog can have a way out. There are always twenty or thirty owners going to claim their dogs every day. At the same time, many hospitals write to them asking for dogs for experimentation, such as the Pasteur Institute, the Southeast Police Academy, and St. John's University, which need about twenty dogs per week. In addition, there are many people who come to the "dog prison" to beg for dogs. They are willing to give away the overdue stray dogs without any conditions. They said, "Finding a way to live for stray dogs is like doing a good deed. We will never use gas unless we have no other choice (that is, when there are too many stray dogs and the dog prison can't hold them)."

### Price Limits and Collection Efforts Combined, Rice Prices Started to Fall Yesterday, Edible Oil, Flour, Staple Foods, and Miscellaneous Grains Also Experienced a Consistent Decline

[Our Newspaper] According to relevant authorities, the reasons for the soaring rice prices in recent days are due to rising prices in the production areas, the busy farming season, the floods in Hunan, and the cabinet reshuffle. After Mayor Wu strictly limited the retail price to no more than 6 million yuan per stone and sold 6,000 stones in the market every day, the prices had slightly fallen on the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Wuxi and other places also fell back to 6.12 million yuan. In addition, the water level in Hunan has begun to fall, people's minds are stable, and it is generally observed that after the new cabinet is formally established, prices may fall further.

The price of rice distributed to each person in this city must be calculated at 95% of the average market price of the last five days of the previous month, according to the Sino-US agreement. The price of rice rose sharply this month. If calculated according to this formula, the price of rice distributed in June will be much higher than the 3.5 million yuan per stone in May, which will stimulate the market and will inevitably cause serious consequences. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are in consultation with the US-China Relief Team.

Yesterday, under the strict enforcement of price limits by the authorities and the continued sale of rice by the Regulation Committee, the off-market price began to fall. The prices of all other commodities consistently weakened, and the cargo owners became more willing to sell. Moreover, due to the price limit, sales were difficult, and few people inquired. The initial asking price for early japonica rice was 6.5 million yuan, but due to slow sales, it was further reduced to 6.4 million yuan. The price of early rice was 6.3 million yuan, a decrease of 300,000 and 350,000 yuan, respectively, and transactions were very rare. The amount of rice sold yesterday was still 6,000 stones, and the registered arrival of goods in the two markets was 3,834 stones.

Due to the excessive rise in flour prices in recent days, the news of the fall in rice prices spread, and people became uneasy. Cargo owners were eager to sell, and there was a chorus of selling. Buyers dared not enter the market rashly, and for a time, there were few sellers. Old "Che Bing Chuan" flour fell from 2.18 million to 2.1 million yuan. The price of flour sold by the China Trust Bureau actually increased by 100,000 yuan to 2.05 million yuan, which had no stimulation to people's minds. "Hong Feng" flour fell into the price range of the flour sold, at 2.03 million yuan, and "Yun Cheng" flour was at 2.05 million yuan. Iron skin was down by 130,000 yuan, and wheat fell sharply by 400,000 yuan.

The price of miscellaneous grains fell like dragons without a leader, all heading down. Buyers were disinterested, while cargo owners were eager to sell at high prices, but there were few buyers. The initial price of yellow beans fell by 200,000 yuan, and the final price of broad beans was 3.35 million yuan, a decrease of 350,000 yuan. Corn was available for sale but lacked buyers, falling by 200,000 yuan. Red sorghum fell by 100,000 yuan. There were few transactions in selected green sorghum, and the market also fell by 100,000 yuan. The bean brokers were hesitant, with prices falling by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Sesame fell by about 300,000 yuan, and raw peanuts fell sharply by 2 million yuan.

Edible oil fell from its peak, and cargo owners, aware that various grains had fallen, also competed to sell. Oil factories also offered oil, and the prices of various off-market goods were low, with few buyers. "Ji Tong" raw oil was 16.05 million yuan, a sharp drop of 1.5 million yuan. "Da You" bean oil opened at 15 million yuan and fell to 14.75 million yuan, also down by 1.45 million yuan. Raw vegetable oil and other oils fell by 1.5 million yuan across the board, reaching about 10%. Small "Che" sesame oil was down by 1.2 million yuan, and the initial price of bean cakes was the most chaotic, with many buyers at 1.5 million yuan. The market later rebounded slightly, to 1.52 million yuan, a decrease of about 130,000 to 140,000 yuan.

### Restrictions on the Use of Same-Day Checks Benefit the Industrial Sector

Remarks from person in charge of the Gold Control Bureau.

[Ta Kung Pao News] The decision to restrict the use of same-day checks will be implemented on June 1, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance.

It is learned that the Shanghai Industrial Association sent representatives to the Gold Control Bureau yesterday morning, requesting that the restrictions on the use of checks be relaxed for legitimate factories. To this end, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the bureau. According to him, prohibiting the use of checks on the same day is intended to prevent customers from issuing blank checks indiscriminately, which is actually beneficial to the industrial sector. Moreover, promissory notes, certified checks, and bills of exchange can all be used. It is not difficult for the industrial sector to use its funds on the same day. In addition, the industrial sector can enter into overdraft or pledge agreements with banks. Those who have such agreements will not be subject to the restriction that same-day checks cannot be used. Banks may not use this as an excuse to reject checks.

### Soaring Mulberry Leaf Prices Affect Fresh Cocoon Production

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 25th] The County Council believes that the price of mulberry leaves has soared to 2.2 million per load, while the price of fresh cocoons is only 21 million. Households are losing too much money and are abandoning raising silkworms, affecting the production of fresh cocoons. It has specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting an increase in the price of fresh cocoons.

### Firewood and Charcoal Prices Soar

The firewood market situation is that there is a shortage of goods in the producing areas, the supply is not abundant, and the expenses such as transportation costs are huge, which increases the cost. People are excited, and trading is not weak. The opening market price of the association is very popular. Chestnut firewood jumps up by 130,000 per load, rising to 480,000 yuan. Miscellaneous firewood rises by 120,000, pushing up to 400,000 yuan. Pine firewood is 320,000 yuan, and dry firewood is 480,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 35% compared to the end of last week.

The charcoal market is selling well because the price of coal balls has risen and the price of kerosene is expensive, so the market is also rising. Green charcoal is expensive at 1.8 million yuan per load, white charcoal is 1.35 million yuan, and black charcoal is 1.2 million yuan, a more than 10% increase compared to the weekend. The price of coal balls at the factory has been raised to 9.65 million per ton, and the retail price is 550,000 yuan per load.

### Stabilization Fund Remains Temporarily Unchanged, The Issue of Retention and Abolition is Currently Out of the Question, A Decision Can Only be Made After the New Cabinet is Formed

The former Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, hosted a banquet at his private residence yesterday afternoon to entertain Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee, and members Mr. Shen Xirui, Mr. Kong Shi'e, and the newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Yu Hongjun, and Deputy Governor Mr. Liu Gongyun. During the banquet, Mr. Chen and Mr. Shen reported to Mr. Yu Hongjun on the foreign exchange income and expenditure during Mr. Zhang Jia'ao's tenure as Governor, as well as the import and export trade situation in recent years. Mr. Yu also expressed his firm retention of Mr. Chen and Mr. Shen's resignation. Mr. Yu also believes that everything at present is of a transitional nature, strictly speaking, because the government reorganization has not yet been completed. The retention or abolition of the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee can only be determined after the new cabinet is formed. Therefore, he expressed his firm retention of the two gentlemen's request for resignation. According to general observation, if Mr. Chen Guangfu resigns as Chairman of the Stabilization Committee, this task may be taken over by Mr. Yu himself, or by one of the two Deputy Governors of the Central Bank. Mr. Shen Xirui's position as Director of the Business Bureau will not be changed for the time being. As for the abolition of the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee, although there are rumors outside, this saying is premature before the government reorganization is completed. However, there is probably no problem that Mr. Yu will make some changes in detail in the future regarding the foreign exchange control policy. Mr. Yu has publicly stated at a press conference the day before that this issue will be improved at any time as needed.

It was also reported that Mr. Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance and Governor of the National Bank, spent the entire morning at the National Bank dealing with official business, meeting with the heads of various departments, listening to the progress of the work and its overview, and also meeting with Mr. Li Du, Director General of the Customs Administration, because Mr. Li had recently been sent to Macau and signed the Sino-Macau Customs Agreement with the authorities on the 20th. In the afternoon, Mr. Yu attended the Board of Directors meeting of the Bank of Communications, and took a trip to Jinjing in the evening to report to the Central Government on the transition process.

Total expenditures were 46.002660075 billion yuan, resulting in a deficit of 8.99619159 billion yuan. The above figures are calculated based on the income and expenditure reported by each group. The total income and expenditure must be settled after the reimbursements from each group are collected.

(2) Report from the Transportation Group: Vehicle ticket revenue is approximately 3 billion to 3.3 billion yuan. Once the settlement is cleared, it can be reported to the Games.

(3) Report from the Sanitation Group: There are still a large number of surplus medicines, which are currently stored in the Municipal Fourth Hospital and will be handed over to the person in charge of the Games for receipt.

(4) Reports from other groups: In addition to the Guard Group returning a surplus of more than 1 million yuan to the Games, most expenditures exceeded the budget. The exact figures have not yet been reimbursed to the Accounting Group.

(5) Report from the Advertising Committee: The total advertising revenue was 4.9 billion yuan. After deducting various expenses and advertising commissions totaling 2.2 billion yuan, the net income was 2.7 billion yuan. Once collected, it will be reported to the Games. Advertising revenue is divided into the following categories: (1) Advertising board revenue of 3 billion yuan, (2) Special advertising revenue of 1.1 billion yuan, including 100 million yuan for the Xinwen Bao balloon and 1 billion yuan for Coca-Cola advertising (the four-sided Coca-Cola advertising flags most noticeable in the stadium, along with Coca-Cola advertising in the swimming pool and gymnasium, cost a total of 650 million yuan, and the remaining 350 million yuan was for radio broadcasting fees), (3) Radio broadcasting report revenue of 500 million yuan (excluding 350 million yuan for Coca-Cola), (4) Advertising revenue published in the Games program of 300 million yuan, totaling 4.9 billion yuan. Finally, Chief Secretary Hao stated in a painful tone: "The most criticized aspect of this Games by all parties was the four-sided Coca-Cola advertising flags hanging high in the four corners of the track and field stadium. However, I was not aware of this advertisement beforehand. Until the day before the opening of the Games, I did not know that the tower-shaped flagpole frame was used to hang Coca-Cola advertising flags, and mistakenly thought it was built by the radio station. Regarding this matter, I have been deeply stimulated spiritually. During the Games, I have endured it all along because I did not want to shirk responsibility, but today I must solemnly declare this to everyone." Finally, he expressed his deep gratitude to all parties and colleagues in the preparatory committee for their enthusiastic assistance during the preparation and holding of the Games.

At yesterday's meeting, two items were also decided regarding the expedited conclusion of the preparatory committee: (1) The committee must be fully concluded by June 10th, and the reimbursement of each group must be completed as soon as possible. (2) The remaining materials handled and received by each group must be returned to the Games before June 10th, and the handling method will be submitted to the Standing Committee for decision.

### British Naval Football Team to Play Donghua Again Today at 5 PM at Yiyuan Stadium

The joint football team of the British Navy's London and Alert ships made their debut a few days ago, defeating the Qingbai team 2-1 at Yiyuan. However, in the last seven minutes, they were penalized with two penalty kicks in a row, resulting in a 2-3 defeat. The team's second match will be against Donghua at Yiyuan at 5 PM today. Tickets are still available in two categories: 60,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan, and will be sold at the City Stadium from 3 PM.

The British Navy's first defeat was a pity, as they led all the way but were defeated in the last few minutes, and the victory or defeat was not due to the game. Although the team's skills are not very refined, their height and strength are great, and their footwork is strong, which is appreciated by all. Central defender Skagen and goalkeeper Weeks are both considered solid. Center forward Morley is exceptionally fierce and a powerful threat, which Donghua must guard against.

Since the departure of Bonnie from Donghua, the last line of defense has felt insecure, and Lin Gen's recent situation is also not good. Chen Jiawan alone seems to be carrying a heavy burden. The stability of the veteran Tan in the central defense line, the ruthlessness of Hannibal, coupled with the assistance of Yu Qia and others, should be able to hold firm. If Sun Laojin can play in the front line, with Gai Xiatixian on the right wing, Han Longhai in the center, and Li "Nephew" on the left and right wings, the five tigers will come out together, and the offensive will be strong. It is expected that they will directly attack the yellow dragon. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

British Navy

Weeks, Mao Shiman, Tan Yiti, Mei Quishi, Skagens, Lin Mann, Ford, Xia Shiqi, Morleyfen, Nolan, Evans

Donghua

Chen Huimin, Chen Jiawan, Zhang Lin'gen, Hannibal, Yu Qiaxing, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Han Longhai, Xia Tixian, Chen Mingzhe

### Communist Bandits Tempt School Children to Receive Training, the Hong Kong Government Takes Measures to Prevent It

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 25th] After the frequent occurrence of missing schoolchildren, although the education and police authorities here have conducted investigations, the reunion of missing schoolchildren with their parents has not yet been realized. Seven male and female students from Guangming School in Yuen Long, New Territories, who disappeared at the beginning of the month, and Liu Zhigui, a male student from Kowloon Nuli School, who disappeared two weeks later, have still not returned home. It is said that all the missing students were deceived by communist bandits active here, left their families, and went to the communist-occupied areas near the border to participate in "Little Devil Team" training. According to reports here, the mother of one of the missing students, Pan Shuliang, sent someone to venture into the communist-occupied area of Wushiyan in Bao'an County to investigate and found Pan Shuzhen mixed in the so-called "Little Devil Team" receiving training such as mountain climbing and maneuvering. After the student missing incident occurred, the parents of students here were all worried. The Hong Kong government authorities have paid serious attention to this and contacted the school authorities to take measures to prevent similar incidents from happening.

### Advocates for Flights: Return Date Postponed; Yunnan's "True Woman General" Hopes to Meet with the "Green Team"

[Report from Our Newspaper] This time, the Yunnan Province delegation to the National Games includes only the women's basketball team. They faced many difficulties: initially, the Department of Education lacked funds, delaying the selection of representatives. They intentionally postponed it until close to the Games' opening, then announced they did not plan to participate. The Shui Zhen team raised funds themselves and rushed to Shanghai by plane. However, the registration deadline had passed the day before, leaving no room for flexibility, so they were unable to participate in the competition. This long journey was in vain, which was quite embarrassing for these girls. After arriving in Shanghai, they first stayed in the East Asia Physical Education School girls' dormitory inside the sports field. The entire team huddled on the floor in a small corner. After the closing ceremony, they had to move out. Fortunately, they were introduced by a fellow townsman and moved to the Taixing Road Women's Rehabilitation Center, living like refugees. The team members are all teachers from Kunming City. Their vacation is coming to an end, and their funds are almost exhausted. They urgently want to return home, but recently, plane tickets from Shanghai to Kunming have been reserved for National Assembly representatives. Ordinary passengers will not be able to board until the 8th to 15th of next month at the earliest. During this free time, Shui Zhen hopes to play several friendly matches with the various teams staying in Shanghai for mutual learning and benefit. However, what makes the Yunnan girls most uncomfortable is that their heroic skills have no place to be used, and they cannot find anyone to play against. The Shui Zhen team has played four friendly matches in Shanghai this time. The first was against the Hubei representative team, the second was against the Nanjing representative team, the third was against the Shanghai women's basketball powerhouse, the Frontline Team, and the day before yesterday, they played a warm-up match against Tianjin before their game. They had originally arranged to play against the Green Team, the women's basketball champion of the National Games, but the Green Team said they needed to rest, so they temporarily replaced them with the Minli Girls' High School. Although Shui Zhen won every game, they dare not be complacent. It is generally believed that it is commendable for a frontier team to have such skills. They most want to play a game with the Green Team, whom they have long admired, regardless of winning or losing, they always want to gain more experience in basketball skills. However, the Green Team has been slow to agree, perhaps because they think that if they win, it is to be expected, but if they lose, it would damage their reputation. Others such as the Philippines, Fujian, and Indonesia are also unwilling to condescend. The Shui Zhen team's disregard for difficulties and their perseverance and spirit this time in Shanghai are all admirable. We hope that the Green Team and other strong teams staying in Shanghai can, in the spirit of sportsmanship, give them sympathy and give them a rare opportunity to compete. We, as fans, also hope to be able to enjoy an exciting match as soon as possible. Our correspondent in England.

### A Tour of the London School of Economics

— By Our Correspondent in England, Sa Ben Geng

The purpose of this dispatch is to introduce to the people of our country an important school for the study of social sciences: the London School of Economics. But before introducing this school, I would like to say a few words about some of the special circumstances of British universities.

British universities have several fundamental differences from those in China. First, the universities here are all private and there are no national universities, although private universities also receive economic assistance from the state, but in the end, their nature is different from that of national universities. Second, not only does Britain not have national universities, but also the Ministry of Education does not interfere with the internal affairs of universities. The universities themselves become autonomous legal entities, so there are no regulations such as "University Laws." Economic assistance is issued by the Ministry of Finance, and does not constitute a kind of "interference" because of the assistance. The British "Education Act" only stipulates the "laws" for education at all levels and types other than universities. Third, all universities have gradually developed, so each school has its own "tradition," and even each college has its own "tradition," emphasizing its own "tradition" rather than uniformity. Although the situations of the various schools have some similarities, their differences are also very large.

The original English name of the London School of Economics is London School of Economics and Political Science. It is one of the several colleges of the University of London. The University of London was established in 1800, and currently the University of London includes dozens of different units. These units were established at different times and gradually joined the University of London. Therefore, although the names of the various units can be called "colleges" in Chinese, in fact, the original English names of the various units all retain their original names, either called College, or School, or Institute. Some units, although called colleges, are internally divided into several colleges. The names of the various colleges also do not have a uniform standard. Some are self-explanatory and one can tell what discipline they are, such as the London School of Economics and the London School of Education. Others have different names, such as "King's College" and "Queen's College." The departments of the various colleges may be the same, for example, the London School of Economics, King's College, and "University College" all have law departments. The various colleges are not at the same address. Although the University of London has uniform regulations for certain methods, it may be said that the various colleges retain their own "tradition" in many more matters. By the way, "college" at the University of London still has somewhat the nature of a "college" in a Chinese university. At Oxford and Cambridge, the college is just a dormitory or a "living unit," which is completely different from a "college" in a Chinese university.

The organization of the school, in terms of vertical organization, includes both undergraduate and graduate programs. In terms of horizontal organization, it includes disciplines such as politics, economics, society, humanities, and law. However, it does not have the distinct departments like Chinese universities. Now I will give a brief description of its main content, which may also give some idea of the general situation of British universities. First, let's talk about the undergraduate program.

Twenty-Eight Weeks of Classes Per Year with No Credit System or Guidance Counselor System

The undergraduate program takes three years to complete. Rather than saying it is divided into departments, it is better to say it is divided into several types of bachelor's degrees. There are only three exams in three years. The first is the entrance exam, the second can be said to be the mid-term exam, held at the end of the first academic year, and the third is the graduation exam, held at the end of the third academic year. Each academic year is divided into three terms. The first term is from October to December, the second term is from January to March, and the third term is from April to June. This system of dividing the year into three terms is the same for all British universities, but the start and end dates of each term are not exactly the same. Generally, the various colleges of the University of London have about twenty-eight weeks of classes per year, with each term averaging about nine weeks. (Cambridge and Oxford have about twenty-four weeks of classes per year.) Therefore, there are many holidays each year. The first thing to do upon entering school is naturally to pay tuition. The school only charges tuition (room and board are self-funded), which costs about 30 pounds per year. Although the school has a small number of dormitories and a dining hall for all teachers and students, these are "paid separately." Because there are few dormitories and many students, most students live off-campus. This is also a very common situation in British universities. Although Oxford and Cambridge have dormitories, they are not cheaper than off-campus housing, so many students still live off-campus. After entering school, naturally, it is time for classes. There is no system of "credits" in classes. Each student has a guidance counselor. You can consult your guidance counselor about what you plan to study and what classes to take. Of course, because of the mid-term and graduation exams, the classes that each person takes are generally related to what they are tested on. The subjects of the exam depend on the degree you are pursuing. Some are required, some are elective. The subjects tested may not be exactly the same as the classes taken in terms of name. Usually, the subjects tested have a wider scope. One subject tested can sometimes include several classes that should be taken. The mid-term exam is very selective. Those who fail will be expelled unless they have special permission.

Literature

### A Soldier

— By Mu Tiyi, Xinjiang; Translated by Shi Tianxing

Mr. Hai Bi'er, the director-general of the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe, came to Shanghai a few days ago. In a conversation, he mentioned a Uyghur writer named Mu Tiyi. At that time, we wanted to find an opportunity to read this writer's works. Later, we heard that Mr. Mu Tiyi was elected as a representative from Xinjiang to the National Assembly and had come to Beijing for a meeting. However, Nanjing is, after all, the political center, and few people seem to have noticed this writer who is famous in the Soviet Union and our country's border regions.

This time, Mr. Shi Tianxing translated this "A Soldier" from the Esperanto version of "New Masses" published in the Soviet Union, allowing us to read a short story by this National Assembly representative and Xinjiang writer. This is truly a happy event.

It is said that Mr. Mu Tiyi came from a working-class background and has traveled to many places. This article is probably a work from his time in the military during World War II. (Editor)

Night was gradually unfolding. As this soldier followed the small path in the forest, walking towards a vast cultivated field, the scene of an approaching storm added to the darkness and horror of the forest—he immediately thought of the descriptions he had heard, and he remembered that the house with ivy climbing on the roof was the one he was looking for. He quickly walked across the cultivated field; as the first drops of rain imprinted themselves in the dust on the road, he knocked on the door. The door opened immediately.

"Is Mr. Malai here?" he asked.

"Dad is not home; he went to town." A lively voice answered, "If you want to see his assistant, he lives nearby."

A young girl appeared on the doorstep, followed by a large dog that barked incessantly. She immediately ordered it to stop barking. Judging from her appearance, she was probably sixteen or seventeen years old. In her gray clothes, her tall and fully developed body could be seen. Her intelligent face still retained her childhood innocence. But her eyes were unusually dignified, steady, and silent. With delicate hands, she smoothed the black, fluffy curly hair from her brow.

"I originally intended to speak with Mr. Malai," the soldier stammered.

Glancing at her, he couldn't help but feel shy. She looked at him in surprise, finding that his apparent shyness was inconsistent with his tall stature, lively manner, and bold, straightforward style.

"If I could come again..." he murmured, "But that is impossible. I will be taking the train tonight. However, just for you—only to you, I have something to say."

As the girl listened to the last sentence, the rain fell even harder. She then invited him into the house and closed the door behind him. They remained in a large, dim room.

"I don't think you know," he began hesitantly, "I think you may have already heard some news. I originally intended to tell your father in detail, but I have to go back quickly, and I must also keep my promise. You should know that I have returned from the front line. My name is Shan Wangfu Ti'an, and I am a friend of someone about whom you are deeply aware. Yes—Tuo Li'an. He was injured—heavily, very heavily—"

"My God!" she cried out, "He hasn't—please tell me the truth!"

He was silent; he assumed she must have understood. When he realized that he should have told her more carefully and slowly, he deeply regretted telling her the unfortunate news too hastily. He expected to see her face turn pale and tears hang on her cheeks. Unexpectedly, there was no trace of the terrible disappointment that he dreaded to see. He repeated softly:

"I promised him these—all of his things, like souvenirs, etc.—to bring here, in case something happened to him. These are them."

He placed a small package tied with a black band on a table between them.

"My God—my God! Poor Luyisi—what a misfortune!" the girl murmured.

"Luyisi? Aren't you Luyisi? Aren't you Bao Lu's fiancée?"

"No, no." She shook her shoulders confusedly and painfully, "Luyisi is my sister. She is already twenty-two years old. They were engaged before this war. I was only fourteen years old then. Poor Luyisi—she truly loved him, so passionately. A few days ago, she felt very unwell. She hasn't received a letter from him in a long time. She and Father went to town to try to find out some news."

"Then you are Aimi Li," the soldier said, "He often talked to me about you—but at that time you were just a child!"

"Yes, I am Aimi Li," she replied.

After a moment of silence, he looked at the small package and began again:

"This is for your sister. He told me that I must bring these here if, in the unlikely event, misfortune befell him. He fell beside me and died on the spot. I quickly did my best to keep my promise. He—Tuo Li'an—is my friend; we spent several months together. When he urged me to swear an oath to come here, he also stated that he would have the same obligation drawn for me, if something happened to me. However, for me, there is nothing to gain."

"Why?" Aimi Li asked, her eyes flickering.

"Why?" Forcing a smile, he replied, "Because I am a lonely person in this world—absolutely lonely. I have no parents, no relatives, no lover—no one cares about me. In short, almost no one gives me love. You know, even on the battlefield, at that time, I couldn't bear to say these things. I said many things that wouldn't interest you."

She looked at him tenderly; she was touched. After a moment of hesitation, the soldier finally asked a question very bravely:

"Do you have a lover on the battlefield?"

She shook her head, her face flushed. They stood there quietly, both bathed in a delicate, ambiguous emotion. They were overwhelmed by the sorrowful grief caused by the pitiful mementos on the table between them. The soldier confusedly thought about how he had been lucky enough to escape from death, and at the same time, he eagerly longed for survival and love. He wanted the object of his feelings to be this lively, black-haired girl. But he didn't have the courage to put his thoughts into words; he merely said:

"I will be leaving. But before I leave, I will ask for your consent one last time. Could you promise me to take care of a companion, so that when anything happens to me, they can bring what I want to leave to you? Would that make you uncomfortable?"

She stared at him. Her gray eyes were full of pity and sympathy, and she trembled slightly as she said:

"You will come back—I believe you will come back."

He repeated silently, understanding her true meaning, and he said harmoniously.

"I will return—here?"

She nodded, indicating her agreement. He took her hand, bent down, reached over the small package between them, and awkwardly kissed her forehead. Finally, in the dim light, he followed the path and walked through the forest. Finally, he gradually disappeared into the lush greenery, into the rain-soaked earth.

### Listening to the Rain with a Snuffed Candle

— Yu Qin

"You listen to the rain yourself, making such rustling sighs. When other people listen to the rain, do you know if their hearts also make such desolate sighs? In different environments, the same rain falls, but among different people, there will not be the same mood. Can you vaguely tell me some of their moods?"

"I feel: some people listen to the rain in an ancient temple on a high mountain, that rain is like an elderly elder speaking with earnest and painstaking advice; some people listen to the rain in a boat cabin on the riverbank, that rain is like a weary traveler sighing with complaint; some people listen to the rain when they wake up from a Red Chamber dream, that rain is like lovers' soft and continuous whispers in a dream; some people listen to the rain in a leaky hut, that rain is like the grating groans of a patient tossing and turning in bed; some people listen to the rain by the desk in a study, that rain is like poets murmuring and answering each other..."

"When you say listening to the rain in an ancient temple on a high mountain, isn't that the scene of 'fine rain returning geese, lonely mountain boundless spring cold' and 'several thoughts of quiet talk together, night rain sitting on a meditation bed'? Listening to the rain in a boat cabin on the riverbank, isn't that the scene of 'a traveler's dream cannot help but be the rain on the back of the boat' and 'a small window, wind and rain break the heart, even more so on a lone boat pillow'? Listening to the rain when waking up from a Red Chamber dream, isn't that the scene of 'listening to the night rain, cold drops on the banana leaves, startling a good dream in the red window'? Listening to the rain in a leaky hut, isn't that the scene of 'how can one get through the long night of soaking wet'? Listening to the rain by the desk in a study, isn't that the scene of 'hating to listen to the rain with a snuffed candle, who accompanies lonely singing'?"

"You must like listening to the rain among the flowers. Isn't it even more beautiful to have flowers and rain? When peach blossoms first bloom, the tender red petals are displaying unparalleled beauty. After a shower, how can you not recall the beauty of a woman's face and peach blossoms and remember the words 'a face like peach blossoms newly wet with rain'? If there is a little sunlight, and the weather is such that the rain is gradually ceasing, and you think of the beauty of the woman, you will remember the beautiful line 'the sun's energy contains lingering rain, the peach blossoms are heavy with rain'; if you see the flowers falling, the petals withering, and you can't help but wonder if the woman has become thin and haggard, you will also think of how the red beauty of 'a cluster of peach blossoms, spring has no owner, left to the wind to blow and rain to beat' is so short-lived! When the plum blossoms first bloom, the yellow plums are moistened by the misty rain, how can you not chant a few lines: 'the plum is yellow, the rain is in season', 'the plum is yellow, the rain is misty', or 'where are the half-yellow plums, towards evening, a curtain of wind and rain', to praise them? 'Just like pear blossoms, spring brings rain', 'rain washes pear blossoms, jade has fragrance', this is the pear blossom covered with rain. The former sentence describes a person, and you can savor this person's appearance from this sentence. The latter sentence is like smelling the fragrance of pear blossoms after being washed by the rain. So the pear blossom covered with rain is also very beautiful, but this is only the beauty of 'plain'; not the 'bright' beauty like peach blossoms; 'apricot blossoms, light silk wet with drizzling rain', 'sometimes feeling desolate after the rain', this is the apricot blossom covered with rain. The words 'drizzling' and 'light' in the former sentence have already described the rain and silk very delicately, and adding the word 'wet' is like seeing the apricot blossoms being wet with rain; the latter sentence says that after the scattered rain, the apricot blossoms are scattered by the rain, and there is bound to be a feeling of desolation, but this is only the desolation of self-pity for one's unfortunate fate. 'Peonies cry in the lingering sun after the rain', 'chrysanthemums brave the rain for the Double Ninth Festival', 'a patch of rouge seems to be wet with rain', you can see the peony's tragic, the chrysanthemum's brave, and the begonia's graceful beauty."

"I don't like listening to the rain, especially not listening to the rain among the flowers. Flowers covered with rain are certainly beautiful, but precisely because they are beautiful, I don't want to listen to the rain among the flowers. As for 'wutong rain' or 'banana rain', those are even more unbearable rains. 'Sparse rain drips on the wutong tree' is still barely bearable to listen to, but 'wutong tree, midnight rain, I don't say the pain of parting is bitter, one leaf, one sound, dripping into the empty courtyard until dawn' is unbearable to listen to. 'Wutong night rain, how many times sleepless' even more shows the harm of this kind of rain, not even being able to sleep, how can one still listen to it? But from this, one also knows how powerful this heart-wrenching thing is!"

"The most difficult rain to listen to is the night rain. Zhang Yutian has long shouted out: 'The first is the difficult night rain.' So listening to the rain is not fun, nor is it an elegant matter; it is really a painful thing. But when it rains outside, one can't help but listen. I have my own way of listening. Pointless tears listen to the rising love spring in my chest, and the rising love spring in my chest listens to the misty raindrops. I can't tell what is a tear? What is rain? I only feel that the mixed love and pain flow gently from the molten spring in my heart..."

I can't say that I don't have a deep love for rain, but the rain that I deeply love is really a zither that plays a desolate melody in solitude. In the heart of the zither, a desolate rhyme from the zither is constantly transmitted from the desolate melody.

### Sea

— Sun Yang

Curled up in this city for too long,

I crave the sea,

I came from the seaside,

I saw the sea's leap,

One wave swallowing another;

It is like an angry giant beast,

Madly wanting to devour everything, tear everything to pieces,

Singing the song of battle with a rain-like melody: …

Yet when the sea is at rest,

It is quieter than any creature;

Under the blue sky's benevolent gaze,

Under the sun's gentle caress,

It is like a newborn infant,

Making even snores,

Cheeks like April's roses,

Or like a ripe apple,

In Nature's cradle,

It dreams golden-green dreams,

In its dreams, white teeth occasionally flash as it laughs: …

It has been a long time since I saw the sea,

But the sea water is already a part of my blood,

When it surges in my veins,

I crave the sea,

I crave the wild sea of ten thousand horses galloping,

I crave the quiet sea like a blue ribbon,

Sea,

Breathing with a broad chest,

Sea,

Singing with a strong life force,

Sea,

Laden with huge ships and feather-like small sailboats,

Filled with food, machinery, civilization, love,

From one pole of the earth to the other …

On the other side of the sea,

In the distant places unreachable by human sight,

There are islands, there are continents, and the people who live on them,

You might think like this:

There are trees that are green all year round, there are red corals,

There is no deception, murder, oppression, fear,

People live freely, loving each other with a true heart …

Sea,

I want to rush towards you,

Leap into your embrace,

Washing away the dirt accumulated in my heart and on my body,

In your impact,

I will begin to laugh loudly,

With agile skill,

Striving to swim to the other shore.

(Chengdu, May)

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation An Old Incident from Seven Years Ago A Dispute Over Mortgaged Housing

Mr. Huang Jianming asks: I have several questions regarding a housing dispute and hope to receive answers in the consultation column. My ancestral home is in Chongde County, Zhejiang. I came to Shanghai to study at a young age. In the 31st year of the Republic [1942], my mother mortgaged a house to a Mr. Lu from the same village. A contract was drawn up, with a term of five years. At the time, I was away and unaware of this. Two years ago, Mr. Lu passed away, and the house is now occupied by his nephew and son. Recently, I returned home on business and was shocked to learn that his nephew suddenly declared that, as the term had expired, the mortgage should be considered a final sale and the house could not be redeemed. I would like to ask: (1) As I was unaware when my mother mortgaged the house to Mr. Lu, is this mortgage legally valid? (2) The mortgage contract was drafted by Mr. Lu's relative, and neither my mother nor the intermediaries were literate and did not understand its contents. Is this type of mortgage contract valid? (3) Does Mr. Lu's nephew have the right to interfere in this matter? (4) As the mortgage term expired two years ago, can the house still be redeemed?

[Lawyer Tang Wushi's Answer] (1) According to inheritance laws, spouses inherit from each other. Therefore, if your father passed away after the implementation of the Civil Code, your mother and you jointly inherited the property. If the house is considered your exclusive property, then according to Article 1088, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, your mother also has the right to use and benefit from it. Based on this, the contract cannot be deemed invalid. (2) If the contract is solely a mortgage (known as "Dian Quan" in the Civil Code) and your mother received the mortgage money, it constitutes a mutual agreement and should be considered valid. If the content exceeds the scope of a mortgage, then it should be discussed separately. (3) Mr. Lu's nephew has no right to interfere. Mr. Lu's son is a minor and should be represented by his guardian. (4) You can request redemption.

### Request for Shen Bao Newspapers

### Recent World Literary Scene

— Zhao Jingshen

Pushkin Museum

The Literary Museum in Leningrad, now belonging to the Soviet Academy of Sciences, developed from the Pushkin Museum, starting in 1905.

The Pushkin Museum is a vast repository of Pushkin's manuscripts, mostly collected from the famous Onegin (A. F. Onegin) and the poet's own library. The latter materials were provided by Pushkin's son, A. Pushkin, in 1906.

Besides Pushkin's own manuscripts and works, the Pushkin Museum began collecting manuscripts and literary materials from other Russian poets, writers, and celebrities.

After the October Revolution, the Pushkin Museum transformed from a literary archive into the Literary Museum of the Academy of Sciences, becoming a center for Soviet literary research.

Now this academic institution has several departments for literary research: Old Russian Literature, New Russian Literature, Western Literature, Folklore and Folk Documents, Images, Audio Recordings, Models, and so on. The Pushkin, Gorky, Blok, and other committees of the Academy of Sciences all fall under the jurisdiction of this Literary Museum.

The manuscript department holds up to 500,000 pages, making it the most important manuscript collection in the Soviet Union. There is also a literary museum department, with about 50,000 items. These exhibition halls feature permanent displays of the lives and works of great Russian writers. For example, Pushkin's last residence, the so-called Pushkin Museum (12 Moika Street), the Nikolai Nekrasov Memorial Museum, and the Pushkin Memorial Park in Mikhailovskoye village are all under the Literary Museum's jurisdiction. The Literary Museum holds about 300,000 literary books.

The main task of the Literary Museum now is to publish a "History of Russian Literature" in ten volumes, from ancient times to the literary revolution. Gorky was the museum director in 1935. The famous scholars on the editorial board include P. Lebedev-Polyansky, A. Orlov, and M. Sholokhov, all members of the Academy of Sciences. Volumes 1, 2, 3, and 5 of this rich literary history have been published, and Volumes 6 and 8 are in print.

Another major task for scholars is the four-volume "History of Russian Literary Criticism," which began during the war (1943). This book narrates from the 18th century to the October Revolution. The first volume, "The Birth of 18th-Century Russian Literary Criticism," has been written and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

Work on the History of Western European Literature has also begun. Last year, the first volume of the "History of French Literature" was published, from ancient times to the revolution of 1789. The second volume, from the revolution of 1789 to the present, is also about to go to print.

"Russian Folklore" in three volumes, is edited by the museum's folklore department. In addition, the museum has published many academic papers discussing important literary history issues. Among the most famous are B. Mellakh's "Ilyich and Problems of Russian Literature in the Transition Period of the 19th Century," P. Lebedev-Polyansky's "Belinsky, the Literary Critic," A. Orlov's "Cossack Heroic Epics, Heroic Themes of Ancient Russian Literature," and V. Adrianova-Peretz's "Studies on the Style of Ancient Russian Poetry."

Of particular note is the translation of "Shakespeare's Complete Works." A. Smirnov, Doctor of Linguistics, wrote a thesis arguing that Shakespeare was the representative of the most sublime humanistic thought of his time. He also analyzed Shakespeare's style and technique. The final chapter covers various historical interpretations of Shakespeare.

C. Derzhavin, Doctor of Linguistics, is also very interested in his research on Voltaire.

This institution publishes regular periodicals and magazines on literary research, such as "Journal of the Pushkin Committee," "Western Literature Report," "Literary Heritage," and "Report of the Manuscript Department of the Literary Museum." The second volume of "Western Literature Report" was published last year, featuring A. Smirnov's "The Art of Shakespeare," and T. Alexeyey's "Defoe and the Problem of Historical Novels," among others.

Another important task of this organization is to publish academic versions of the complete works of Russian literature, such as those of Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, and Belinsky.

### Re-visiting Mei Lanfang (Part 2)

— Cao Zikai

Thinking about his evening performance of "Selling the Horse," I felt that I should let him rest and not bother him any further, so I got up to say goodbye. But taking a photo was a must. I asked him to go to the open space outside as before. This open space was the same as last year, except for the addition of a small goat. This little goat was affectionate and very cute. Because I didn't invite a photographer, Chen Baoyi and I took turns taking the pictures. Because I didn't bring a tripod, I couldn't use the self-timer, so the two of us took turns operating the camera, each taking a photo with the Peking Opera King. These two fan girls regretted that they couldn't take a photo with the Peking Opera King at the same time. On the way out after saying goodbye, they kept muttering many "I shouldn't haves." [Editor's note: In order to make up for this "I shouldn't have," I hesitated for a long time. The two photos that Mr. Feng sent me were identical in composition, and it was impossible to publish them both. Publishing just one would be unsatisfactory, so I discussed it with Mr. Lu, the person in charge of typesetting at the newspaper (Mr. Feng's student). The result is the photo now published. For poetic justice, I don't think there's any problem with this, right?]

But I fell into deep thought. This is what I thought:

Last spring, I visited Mei Lanfang with a religious state of mind, feeling that in the impermanent life, his career was a play within a play, a dream within a dream; a fleeting moment, a pity! This spring, I visited Mei Lanfang with an artistic state of mind, and I felt that his art had the highest social value and was most worthy of promotion. There are many kinds of art, no less than a dozen: painting, medicine, epigraphy, sculpture, architecture, crafts, music, dance, literature, drama, film, photography. Among these dozen arts, the most deeply rooted in the people is Peking Opera in drama—farmers and old men, village children, who don't know a word or understand painting, and have never seen a movie, but they can all hum a few Peking Opera tunes, and they all understand Cao Cao's treachery, Guan Gong's loyalty, Third Lady's chastity, and Dou E's injustice…and appreciate with fascination, and comment with enthusiasm. This proves that Peking Opera (or local dramas similar to Peking Opera) has a long history in our country, is deeply rooted, and penetrates everywhere, so its social effect is the highest. Calligraphy and painting are also ancient arts with thousands of years of history, why are they far less popular than Peking Opera? This further proves that Peking Opera not only has a long history, but also has a kind of magic in its essence that attracts human feelings and goes deep into people's hearts, so it can be so popular, so popular with the masses. It's just a pity that some of the Peking Opera that has been passed down in the past contain toxins in terms of content and meaning, such as feudal ideology, male chauvinism, and superstitious ghosts and gods. If this kind of toxin can be removed and replaced with vitamins that enhance people's health, then the social effect of Peking Opera is limitless, and it is easy to use it to govern the country and pacify the world. At that time, our Peking Opera King will become a wise king of the world!

I forgot to mention earlier: when I visited Mr. Mei, I also gave him a fan painted and calligraphed by myself. What I painted was the monk Manshu's poem "Maids Gathering Firewood Amidst Mountains of Red Leaves." What I wrote was the song "Golden Thread Song" that Hongyi, when he was still a layman, gave to the singing boy Jinwawa. The words said: Autumn has arrived in Jiangnan. Too hastily, spring's remaining dream shadows, before the cup, under the brows. Indulge in the music of middle age, racing through rouge-painted troops in fur. How did it all come to be remnants? A pure jade from Kunlun, a clear god, purple cherries freely tying red affections. Ten thousand measures of sorrow, come, put it away. Meddle with the painted faces on the stage. Experience the heroism, the autumn lady's feelings. The sounds of the young phoenix are clear, dissolving the anger that fills the chest. I laugh at myself as just a commoner. Running around the world without achieving anything, I ask, how is it that I entrust my feelings to sights and sounds? Ten thousand measures of sorrow, come, put it away. Both painting and medicine were written with a very full spirit on a clear morning. Because this person has such a vast and universal artistic genius, and has shown such a noble personality in the anti-Japanese war period—I sincerely love him, and I have to "bow down at his pomegranate skirt." (Others ridicule my words.) I should actually bow down. Feng Zikai, "famous throughout the world," "known to women and children" (others praise my words), the teahouse and the bookkeeper of the Zhenhua Hotel did not recognize. It was not until the next day that Mr. Mei came to the hotel to visit me in return, and the teahouse and bookkeepers were surprised, and then they went to buy commemorative albums to ask me to write inscriptions. (Written in Hangzhou on May 22nd of the 37th year of the Republic [1948], the day Mei Lanfang stopped performing.)

### Pay Attention to Yang Mei

— Miao Wenrui

The news of Yang Mei in Sichuan not eating for nine years, as reported by this newspaper for several days, has aroused the curiosity of many readers. Most scientists believe it is absurd and unworthy of attention, and more readers regard it as gossip for after-dinner conversation. But since the report in this newspaper on May 15th and 16th that Yang Mei's not eating is a fact, we can no longer regard it lightly, and some visionary scientists have become nervous. If all human beings in the world were like Yang Mei and did not eat all year round, then land reform or land revolution would lose their arguments, agriculture and agricultural administration would lose their importance, and most farmers would change their occupations, and politics and life would undergo great changes!

Director Li Zhiyu has used scientific methods to confirm that Yang Mei's not eating is a true fact. According to the report in this newspaper, the next step will be to invite the Dean of the West China University Medical School to study her metabolism. All living things have metabolism, and without this function there is no life. Since Yang Mei can live, there must be metabolism, no doubt, but its nature is similar to that of plants, as long as it absorbs air and spring water, it can directly manufacture substances in the body and generate heat to maintain life. Yang Mei's physiological state may have the following two scenarios: In the first scenario, the hemoglobin in Yang Mei's body may have deteriorated and is similar to the chlorophyll of plants, and with carbon dioxide and water, it can produce carbohydrates without having to ingest other foods. In the second scenario, Yang Mei's blood may contain special bacteria that secrete an enzyme that makes the function of hemoglobin similar to that of chlorophyll, directly manufacturing carbohydrates in the body. If Yang Mei belongs to the first scenario, then there is a "vegetable person" in the world, one more miracle, if we can find the reason, then everyone can make their own hemoglobin deteriorate and not eat all year round; if it belongs to the second scenario, we can take a small amount of Yang Mei's blood, use artificial culture to cultivate the bacteria, and then transplant the bacteria into the human body, then all humans in the world can not eat. Based on these views, the author hopes that Director Li Zhiyu will pay attention to Yang Mei's blood properties and physiology. Since Yang Mei can not eat, there must be a reason, if we can fully know the secret, then everyone can not eat and become the so-called "earthly immortal." Yang Mei is a research material that is hard to come by in a thousand years, I hope that scientists across the country will pay attention to this material and study it carefully!

From the left: Mei Lanfang, Feng Zikai, Mr. Feng's daughter Yiyin and Chen Bao.

### Touching Fish Roe

— Chen Meng'an

How many more winds and rains can be endured? How much sorrow is added? Years are spent growing old by sorrow, and it has nothing to do with the end of spring; the flowers understand language, and they are already filled with hatred, scattered and becoming fragrant soil; swallows dance, counting the embellishments of good times, dreams are confused and drunk, the taste is not as before. Jiangnan is good, do not grieve over the past, fragrant grass on the southern shore, China only has tears at the New Pavilion, a broken heart like Pan Lang's poems, you and I should cherish it, moving the palace and changing the tune on the perilous strings, a thousand threads, looking at the slanting intestines outside the willows, the vast river water silently flows eastward.

### Water Dragon Chant

In early spring, I once obtained a sentence: "Do not say that injuries cannot be expected, the grass grows in Jiangnan again at this time, the scenery before me surrounds my heart, I am too lazy to learn to write poetry." The meaning touched me, and I created it casually, not knowing what it was referring to. Sitting silently on a clear night, I found it in scattered books, and developed it into this tune, still with the same meaning.

Heartbreaking smoke and willows slanting in the sun, spring has passed two-thirds, red is sparse and green is dark, swallows are busy and orioles are tender, what does it have to do with people! Spring is pitiful enough, spring still has a way, thousands of miles of Jiangnan, I ask the long pavilions and short mounds, coming south and going north, how much sorrow do you taste? Counting with my fingers, how many happy moments can there be? Just sing wildly, smashing the jade pot; the emotions in my heart, the scenery before me, are still the same today, do not ascend the tower lightly, you must drink wine, exhaust your heroic spirit, let the unsatisfactory things, eight or nine times out of ten, entrust to deep drunkenness.

### America's Guest House

— Lei Hong

America's guest house for foreign dignitaries is across from the White House, known as Blair House. The government purchased this building in 1940. The hostess of the mansion is Mrs. Kinnane. Whether she's called the hostess, housewife, or manager, her work is more than just making tea and coffee. She manages servants, books, and shopping.

She has hosted presidents from every country in Central and South America. Others, such as King Peter of Yugoslavia, Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the Prime Minister of Canada, and countless foreign ambassadors and ministers—Molotov has visited twice—have all stayed at this mansion. President Roosevelt, for the sake of rest, lived at Blair House. Truman also lived there for three weeks before entering the White House.

According to Mrs. Kinnane, national leaders are the easiest people in the world to host because they are all humble and polite. "I always let guests stay quietly in their rooms and don't disturb them," she said. "They come to America with important missions, and they are not at peace. This is the only place where they can rest and relax, so I always avoid meeting them. I never eat with them, but if they ask me to have tea with them, I will."

People think that Mrs. Kinnane's job is very easy, but in fact, she has no summer or winter vacation and works 12 to 18 hours a day. If there are no foreign envoys to host, the Secretary of State uses Blair House to host foreign ambassadors for meals, tea, or dinners. Once a distinguished guest is lodging, everything from breakfast to sleep must be taken care of, to check whether everything goes smoothly. And serving guests sleep usually takes until 3:00 a.m. to rest.

Guests often write to Mrs. Kinnane after leaving America and returning home, full of pleasant memories. At every festival, kings and magnates send Mrs. Kinnane congratulatory letters and telegrams.

Mrs. Kinnane was born in Washington. Twenty-eight years ago, she met Mrs. Blair at a picnic. Later, Mrs. Blair asked her to host this aristocratic mansion on Pennsylvania Avenue, and so she became the housekeeper of the mansion and has continued to this day for 20 years.

Later, the American government bought the mansion, which was like buying Mrs. Kinnane as well. Her first hosting of government officials won unanimous praise, so the State Department asked her to serve Blair House as a lifelong career.

The visit of the Saudi Arabian princes to Blair House can be regarded as the most exotic. During the week that the princes lived there, it was as if they had transformed the mansion into another world. They were all six feet tall and wore beautiful robes. They walked without a sound. In fact, you really couldn't hear a sound from them in the house. They were extremely devout in their religion, and the incense in the room swirled, reaching outside the room.

### Chekhov's Sayings

— Dongfang Mengwu

The road to the court is wide, but the road back is narrow.

A bad peace is better than a good fight.

Poverty is not a sin, but it is worse than a sin.

In the storm, it is okay to pray to God, but you still have to try your best to move forward.

The worst brandy is better than water.

### Masaryk's Humor

— Yuchuang

The former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk, who recently committed suicide, was a very humorous figure during his lifetime.

Once, a diplomat talked to him about the United States. The diplomat said: The food in America is not bad, but at banquets, the female guests on your left, right, and across from you seem to have endless questions every day, making you busy answering and simply not having time to eat.

Masaryk was naturally an old hand at attending such banquets. He said that he had a wonderful method for eating safely at banquets.

His method was: "I first ask the female guest sitting on my right: 'Are you married?' If her answer is 'yes', I ask her again if she has any children. If she answers, 'yes, two,' I say, 'Why bother?' She will no longer bother me... Then I ask the female guest sitting on my left, and it turns out that she is also married. I ask her again if she has any children, and she says, 'No.' I ask, 'How is that possible?' She will no longer pay attention to me... Then I ask the female guest sitting across from me: 'Are you married?' She says, 'No.' I ask again: 'Then do you have any children?'—After this set of questions and answers, I can eat with peace of mind, without fear of being disturbed by others."

### Vegetarianism

— Ruyi

According to recent scientific research, the only animals that live longer than humans are a species that grows on the Seychelles Islands. This species is vegetarian.

The longest-lived mammal besides humans is the elephant, and the elephant is vegetarian.

The longest-lived member of the bird family is the parrot, and the parrot is vegetarian.

Apes, the "close relatives" of humans in the animal world, are also vegetarian.

### A Miracle

— Jin Jin

One day, due to my work, I was passing a corner of Gongping Road in Hongkou when I caught sight of a stack of brand-new Western magazines tied together with rope at a secondhand stall. I bent down to take a look and saw that some were French drama magazines and others were British publications. The majority were American magazines on subjects such as chemistry, mathematics, economics, sociology, journalism, and art. After casually selecting five or six, the stall owner priced them by weight. In the end, I spent 190,000 Legal Tender to buy the latest April to May 1948 publications, worth two dollars and fifteen cents in gold bullion. This even included a May issue of Reader's Digest from this year. Amidst this rampant inflation, it must be said, this is nothing short of a miracle.

While I was astonished by this miracle, I couldn't help but feel a few emotions. Firstly, when all is said and done, the fate of books is always unfortunate. If these were not books, but nylon stockings, lipstick, pens, or ties, they would probably have been sold at a good price long ago. I think there are more people willing to spend money on a tie worth one US dollar than on a book of the same value. Not to mention learning for practical use, it seems that fewer and fewer people regard knowledge as an adornment in this era. Now, we seem to only hear the boasting of numbers, such as Mr. A spending 70 million on a custom-made suit, etc. On the other hand, even those who pretend to be refined seem out of touch with the times.

Secondly, I am someone who believes that "opportunity knocks but once." It is hard to say when I will be able to buy similar inexpensive books again. A friend of mine who studies music once discovered a complete set of recordings by a major composer in a consignment store. At the time, they couldn't close the deal due to a difference of several tens of thousands of dollars. By the time he brought the money back to buy them, someone else had already beaten him to it. In reality, buying records is like this, buying books is like this, and so too is life's fortune. It's just that merely having opportunity, without knowing how to use it, is still useless. Here, I am often reminded of a saying in a biography from a certain issue of Fortune: "Opportunity is at the disposal of those who are prepared."
