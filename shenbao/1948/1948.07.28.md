[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Control Yuan held its 26th meeting at 9:30 AM on the 27th, chaired by President Yu. They continued to discuss the "Draft Measures for the Election of Supervisory Committee Members for Administrative Offices." The speeches of the committee members still expressed dissatisfaction with the Organic Statute of Administrative Offices passed by the Legislative Yuan. However, out of a spirit of abiding by the law, in addition to requesting reconsideration, they had no choice but to proceed with the establishment in accordance with the law. After repeated discussions today, and after several people put forward amendments and temporary motions for a vote, the proposal by Qing Shen'an was finally passed by a majority: "Supervisory Committee Administrative Offices and Inspection Teams should be established simultaneously. The organization of the inspection teams: 1. Taiwan, 2. Mongolia, 3. Overseas, 4. Provinces and regions where administrative offices are not located but are deemed necessary." The reason this proposal was passed was that it could supplement the shortcomings of the Organic Statute of Administrative Offices, and at the same time, it could immediately organize and begin work. The passage of this proposal has resolved the administrative office issue, which had been debated for two days without a decision.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Control Yuan continued to hold its 26th general meeting in the afternoon of the 27th, chaired by President Yu.

The opinions of the committee members were summarized and put to a vote. As a result, it was passed by a majority that each province and city Supervisory Committee would nominate three to seven candidates. The second article, concerning the distribution of native and non-native committee members, caused heated debate. Committee members such as Liu Pingjiang spoke in favor of maintaining the original draft, while Liang Shangdong proposed that the number of native committee members be limited to one. The chairman put it to a vote. Of the 88 people present, 52 voted in favor of maintaining the original text, which stated that no fewer than one elected member should be a non-native Supervisory Committee member. The remaining third, fourth, and fifth articles were passed without objection. The chairman then asked for the opinion of the assembly on Article 3 of the "Organic Statute of the Supervisory Committee Administrative Offices of the Control Yuan," which stated, "The Supervisory Committee Administrative Offices in each Supervisory District may be decided by a meeting of the Control Yuan not to be established or to be merged for establishment." It was resolved to temporarily establish (1) Ningqing District, (2) Yulu District, (3) Jinshan Sui District, (4) Yungui District, (5) Liangguang District, (6) Lianghu District, (7) Wangang District, (8) Mintai District, (9) Suzhe District, (10) Jirecha District, (11) Chuankang District, and (12) Liaoning Andong Liaobei District, and to have each district nominate one convener (list attached) to convene meetings and elect candidate committee members. The list should be submitted to the Secretariat before noon on the 28th for the purpose of printing ballots. Finally, they discussed the temporary motion by Lu Fengge and 23 others, "Please request the Executive Yuan to quickly send cadres to preside over the government of Rehe Province, save the current critical situation, protect this important national defense location, and comfort public opinion." After the original proposer, Lu Fengge, explained the reasons, Wang Guanwu and Zhang Dinghua successively spoke, and it was passed without objection to be sent to the Executive Yuan for correction. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. The list of conveners for the twelve districts is now recorded below: Gan Ningqing District: Quan Shaowen, Jilu District: Zhao Jixun, Pushan Sui District: Zhu Mengbiao, Yungui District: Gu Yingqiu, Liangguang District: Li Xuhuan, Lianghu District: Chen Darong, Wangang District: Cao Haosen, Mintai District: Chen Dayuan, Suzhe District: Liu Pingjiang, Jirecha District: Wang Xuan, Chuankang District: LÃ¼ Chao, Liaoning Andong Liaobei District: Qi Dapeng.

Editorial

### The Formation of the Marie Cabinet in France

Just as the Cold War in Berlin was raging, the Schuman cabinet in France suddenly collapsed, forcing Foreign Minister Bidault, who was attending the Western European Five-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference far away overseas, to return home ahead of schedule. From whatever perspective one observes it, the cabinet crisis in France always deepens the instability of the European situation. However, after a week of political turmoil in France, the formation of a cabinet by Radical Socialist leader Marie has finally stabilized the situation. Whether for France itself or for the entire Europe, the formation of Marie's new cabinet is a welcome development.

The reason for the collapse of the Schuman cabinet this time, on the surface, was due to the defense budget issue. The defense expenditure proposed by Prime Minister Schuman and the Popular Republican Movement he led was 117 million US dollars, but the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party advocated reducing it by 17 million US dollars. The National Assembly actually passed this bill to cut the defense budget on the evening of the 19th. In order to avoid holding a general election, the Schuman cabinet announced its resignation without waiting for the parliament to pass a vote of no confidence. However, looking into the behind-the-scenes aspects of French politics, the collapse of the Schuman cabinet was due more to the failure of the Schuman cabinet's diplomacy than to the reduction of the defense budget. Since the conclusion of the West German Agreement at the London Six-Nation Conference, the French government and public have become suspicious and fearful of the Anglo-American "pro-German policy," and the reputation of Foreign Minister Bidault, who signed on behalf of France, has been ruined ever since. Although the Schuman cabinet survived the crisis thanks to the reluctant approval of the National Assembly, its position in the eyes of the French people began to waver from then on. This collapse can be said to be an inevitable result of the evolution of the French political situation.

Cabinet changes are commonplace in democratic countries, especially in France, where cabinet changes are frequent, and it is not uncommon to replace several cabinets in one month. But why should we pay special attention to this cabinet change now? The reason is very simple. According to the current French constitution, if two governments are overthrown by the parliament through a vote of no confidence in succession, a national general election must be held. The leftist Communist Party and the right-wing Gaullist faction have long been eager to use the general election to seize power. The French Communist Party has long had the ambition to seize power, not to mention it for the moment. As for the Gaullist faction, de Gaulle openly said in a speech in Paris on July 19: "The National Congress of the People's Rally should formulate a policy program that can be implemented immediately, because there will be a need for this soon, and France must be led by the People's Rally." At the same time, he also put forward four propositions: (1) solve social problems with "associations"; (2) solve colonial problems with the French Federation; (3) deal with the Soviet threat to Europe with the European Federation; (4) rescue the domestic crisis by reorganizing the government.

However, in terms of France's current position in Europe and its actual needs, neither the leftist Communist Party nor the right-wing Gaullist faction is what France needs. In other words, the ruling of the left and right wings is harmful and unprofitable to the country and the nation. Therefore, after the collapse of the Schuman cabinet of the Popular Republican Movement, the French government and the public all hoped that France could maintain a government that takes the middle road. When President Auriol and Socialist veteran Blum discussed the candidates for prime minister, they favored Radical Socialist leader and former Minister of Justice Marie. Their reason was: "If a person from the Radical Socialist Party is appointed as prime minister, it can dispel the fear of the rise of the de Gaulle movement among the general public." Everyone knows that the French Radical Socialist Party is misnamed. Although it is nominally called the Radical Socialist Party, its actual progress is not as rapid as that of the Socialist Party. The National Assembly also believed that organizing a center-right cabinet was better than holding a general election that would give de Gaulle the opportunity to seize power. Therefore, it agreed to Marie as prime minister with a majority of 352 to 190 votes, allowing him to form a new cabinet. At the same time, the Socialist Radical Socialist and Popular Republican Parties also believed that Marie's qualifications might not meet the expectations of the public at home and abroad, so they decided that the leaders of the three parties would all participate in the organization of a coalition cabinet to enhance the position of the Marie cabinet. The most eye-catching names on the new cabinet list are Socialist veteran Blum as Deputy Prime Minister, Independent Republican leader Reynaud as Minister of Finance, Popular Republican leader Teitgen as Deputy Prime Minister, Socialist leader Ramadier as Minister without Portfolio, and Schuman himself as Foreign Minister. Such a lineup is stronger than any coalition cabinet and seems to be more than capable of coping with domestic and foreign difficulties.

However, the problems facing France are numerous, among which the most difficult one is France's diplomatic problem. France's situation between the Western allies and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly difficult. The middle road has become impassable in fact, and where to go has caused the feeling of being torn between two options. Another problem is France's economic problem. Due to the destruction of the war, the country is full of scars. If economic recovery is to be mentioned, foreign aid must be obtained. However, relying on foreign aid economically, it has no choice but to follow others diplomatically, and even has to accept the West German Agreement that is only beneficial to Germany. This contradictory behavior can not only be used as material for the left wing to attack, but also as a reason for the right wing to oppose. When Marie first announced his policy guidelines to the National Assembly, he also focused on foreign policy and placed domestic issues in a secondary position. Marie said: "France's position in Europe should always pay attention to not engaging in excessive provocations, but also should maintain a firm stand at times. I will implement a firm but non-provocative foreign policy: (1) The German policy should be based on the resolutions of the London Six-Nation Conference. France is willing for Germany to regain its proper position in Europe, but it cannot sacrifice the interests of other European countries because of this. I believe that the opportunity of the next United Nations General Assembly to be held in Paris in September should be used to seek a thorough solution to the German problem. (2) Regarding Anglo-French relations, I believe that France must work hand in hand with the United Kingdom and unconditionally support the Anglo-French 50-year alliance treaty. (3) Regarding US aid, France should be grateful for the Marshall Plan's aid to Europe, but France must still prepare to help itself so that it can stand on its own after US aid stops.

From the report of the new Prime Minister Marie, the Marie cabinet is still a continuation of the Schuman cabinet, and there is no difference in essence. In today's Europe, where polarization is becoming increasingly clear, France's situation is becoming more and more difficult. How to deal with both sides? It is indeed a difficult task. We look forward to the future of the center-right Marie cabinet, but we still cannot be overly optimistic.

### Head of the Ministry of Transportation Discusses: Our Country Upholds Inland Navigation Rights; US Ships Carrying US Aid Must First Obtain Special Permission

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Our country's shipping industry mostly opposes the government's special permission for American ships to carry goods into the two ports of the Yangtze River, Jing and Hu. According to a discussion with the head of the Ministry of Transportation, the government's special permission for American ships to carry aid to China into the two ports of the Yangtze River, Jing and Hu, is completely different from the opening of inland navigation rights. The Ministry of Transportation believes that the opposition opinion held by our shipping industry is not without merit. The government has always upheld inland navigation rights, and will continue to follow this policy in the future without changing it. As for foreign ships sailing to non-open ports, it is customary to first obtain special permission from the Executive Yuan before they can enter. The transportation of US aid materials this time can also be handled by the Executive Yuan at its discretion, according to this special permit to enter the inland port. Regarding the total tonnage of US aid materials, it is said to be about one million tons. Currently, our country has about 30 ships that meet international standards and can sail abroad, all of which can be entrusted with the transportation of US aid materials. As for the transfer of these materials from the coast to the inland, in addition to the need to strengthen the unloading equipment, it will not be very difficult for our country's ships to carry them.

### US Plasma Substitute: Gelatin Shipped to China

Evans to Come to China to Instruct on Usage

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] The US Medical Aid to China Bureau announced that it has issued a special appropriation of US$20,000 to China for the purchase of gelatin, a plasma substitute. 10,000 units of a solid, transparent, tasteless, gelatinous protein extracted from the white binding tissue and cortex of animal bones. Introducing the application of gelatin to China to replace high-priced plasma is an important part of the bureau's 1948 plan. It is said that gelatin is cheaper and easier to apply than plasma, making it ideal for China. Although gelatin tends to transform into a colloidal substance at low temperatures, it is very effective in hospitals for fainting and blood loss. Dr. Evans, one of the most famous female surgeons in the United States and professor at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, will go to China after August to instruct Chinese surgeons on the use of gelatin. Dr. Evans is an authoritative scholar in this field. She will visit Japan in August on behalf of the US Atomic Bomb Injury and Disease Committee, and then transfer to China. The Medical Aid to China Bureau has already shipped the gelatin to China in preparation for the implementation of this medical program.

### Wuhu's Scorching Heat is Beneficial to Rice Fields; General Harvest Expected in Half a Month

[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 27th] Wuhu's current water level is 11.075 meters, down 0.075 meters from yesterday. The scorching heat accelerates the grain filling of rice ears. A general harvest can be expected in 15 days. Wuhu rice prices have fallen back to 30 million yuan. Rice in Anqing and other places is only 15 million yuan.

### Ministry of Food Cables the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters: Absolutely No Borrowing or Allocating Military Grain

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th] The Pacification Headquarters received a telegram from the Ministry of Food on the 27th, stating that according to reports, your headquarters and the Chongqing Municipal Government consulted and decided that since the county-level public grain ordered by the Ministry in various counties near Chongqing has not been paid, the county governments should allocate 100,000 shi of this grain for the municipal government to sell for civilian consumption. An investigation found that the payment for the provincial and county-level grain purchased by the Ministry in Sichuan Province had already been allocated to the provincial government for distribution, and that the grain in various counties near Chongqing was conveniently concentrated, making it the most reliable source of grain for external transfer. Borrowing or allocating it would directly affect the external transfer of military grain and indirectly affect the supply of military grain at the front. Currently, hundreds of thousands of troops in the Northeast, Hebei, Henan, Qing, Ji, Xu, Hai, Jing, and Shanghai and other places require tens of thousands of large packages of regular military grain every month, all of which rely on the established grain sources in Sichuan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces for transport and relief. During the current flood season, it is necessary to step up the daily transport of the required military grain. Ships have already been negotiated in many ways. All of the above-mentioned purchased grain should be concentrated and transported immediately, and it must not be diverted. In addition to cabling the Sichuan Provincial Government to strictly order the county governments to concentrate and allocate transport in accordance with the original plan, please supervise and order them to immediately stop borrowing and allocating to maintain military food supplies.

### Ministry of Food Dispatches Personnel for a Thorough Investigation Result: Wuxi Does Not Have Large-Scale Grain Hoarding; The Situation of Shanghai Grain Escaping to Wuxi is Also Untrue

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] News from the Ministry of Food: Regarding the so-called Wuxi grain hoarding case in Shanghai, the Ministry dispatched Shen Guojin, Director of the Storage and Transportation Department, and Inspector Wang Mingyi, along with Zhuang Qianghua, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Grain Use Department, to conduct a thorough investigation. The report is as follows: (1) Regarding the amount of grain stored in Wuxi, the Shanghai telegram reported that there were 300,000 dan of stored grain. An investigation found that this was a statistical figure before the Wuxi County Government carried out the sale at stable prices on June 19. At the time of the investigation, the actual number of grains stored in various warehouses and stations was more than 527,000 dan of paddy rice, more than 5,000 dan of yuan rice, more than 11,000 dan of japonica and indica rice, and more than 97,000 bags of flour (including 78,000 bags of flour to be delivered to the Agricultural Bank of China and the China Trust Bureau that were purchased and transported north). In addition, grain stores and rice mills store about 200,000 dan of grain, and flour mills store about 100,000 dan of wheat raw materials. Compared with the storage amount at the same time in previous years, the above-mentioned amount of 520,000 dan of grain stored in warehouses and stations is already very different, and Wuxi is the main rice market on the Jing-Hu line, supplying Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and dozens of cities and counties north and south of the Yangtze River. This amount is not too much, but when grain prices fluctuate, the grain administration authorities in the county should order various households to provide for market needs to fulfill the supply capacity of the distribution market. (2) It is true that the grain stored in Wuxi warehouses and stations has the names of grain tributes, accumulated grain, and public grain agency households from Wuxi, Kunshan, Nanhui, Jiangyin, Changshu, and Tianchang counties, totaling more than 28,000 dan of japonica and indica rice, but each county's council has provided proof, and the Wuxi District Court Inspection Office has confirmed that it is true, so there should be no situation of hoarding under false names. (3) From June 2 to July 13, more than 7,000 packages of rice were transported from Jiaxing and Xiashi to Wuxi. An investigation found that they were transported from Wenjiazhen and Yingtan in Jiangxi via Jiaxing and Xiashi, and they were not Zhejiang rice. China Travel Service has submitted proof of transport and transfer in Jiaxing and Xiashi. (4) Regarding the Shanghai hoarding households' fleeing transportation of stored grain to Wuxi, an investigation found that only 9 carts of military grain and salt were transported from Shanghai to Wuxi on June 20, and only a small amount of single-hulled wooden boats were transported by waterway, which was a very small number, and there was no large-scale Shanghai grain escaping to Wuxi.

### Tianjin Cracks Down on Large-Scale Smuggling Case; Total Value of Smuggled Goods is Hundreds of Billions; Suspicion of Aiding Bandits is Serious, Transferred to the Special Criminal Court for Interrogation

### Strengthening the Function of Trade with Japan; Private Business Representatives to Japan: The Number of People Decided to be Relaxed; The Length of Stay in Japan is Appropriately Extended Depending on the Facts

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Our country's trade with Japan has gradually started to open up.

Tang Jusheng, the commercial specialist of our country's representative group in Japan, recently reported to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting relaxation. The ministry lightly submitted it to the 14th meeting of the Trade Guidance Committee with Japan for discussion. It was generally believed that our country's trade with Japan was a barter trade. Under the strict control of the Allied Headquarters, the procedures were very complicated. The original one-month deadline could not be completed, and the number of people and the deadline should be relaxed. It was resolved by the whole body that private business representatives to Japan should be dispatched once every three months, with 60 to 100 people in each batch. The length of stay in Japan should be appropriately extended depending on the actual needs to facilitate the promotion of trade. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has prepared a document for submission to the Executive Yuan for verification. According to the report of Tang Jusheng, commercial specialist of the resident representative group in Japan: As of mid-July, more than 30 contracts have been signed for our country's trade with Japan, with a total trade value of approximately US$500,000. Private businessmen in Japan continue to engage in trade. The domestic industry and commerce community attaches great importance to the development of Sino-Japanese trade and has requested to participate, so it should be relaxed. Moreover, the Allied Headquarters' new regulations have long abolished the restrictions on the number of people from each country. Any merchant from any country who intends to go to Japan for trade can go after being approved by his home government. Our country should take this opportunity to strengthen the trade function to win the international market.

### President Truman's Message to Congress, Presents Eleven-Point Plan, Focusing on Stabilizing the Economy and Solving the Housing Shortage

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 27th Broadcast: President Truman today presented a message to the special session of the US Congress with seven major points, requesting that it be passed into law. In addition to wage and price controls, the US President particularly emphasized the point of domestic anti-inflation, stating: "This work is urgent, as inflation has a great connection with the US foreign policy. The Communist Party deeply hopes that the prosperity of the United States will turn into a recession. They do not believe that we can stop the rise in prices, and think that the economic collapse of our country is inevitable. If a recession really occurs in our country, the hope for world peace will surely disappear with it."

[United Press, Washington, 27th] The Republican-controlled 80th Congress reconvened yesterday. President Truman today presented an eleven-point plan that he hopes to implement, which is politically explosive. Among them, "anti-inflation" and "housing problem" are at the forefront, and other points include: (1) Federal subsidies for education; (2) Increasing the national minimum wage; (3) Expanding social security; (4) Revising the ranks and salaries of federal civil servants; (5) Bill of Rights; (6) Amendment to immigration law; (7) $65 million US loan for the permanent headquarters of the United Nations; (8) Approval of the International Wheat Agreement; (9) Restoration of the $58 million fund for the power reclamation plan.

[United Press, Washington, 27th] The most politically contentious parliament in American history has begun in a fierce atmosphere. The Republican Party is determined to oppose the President's expansion of his economic control powers. They hope that Truman will re-introduce the Bill of Rights, as this caused a revolt among Southern Democrats in mid-February of this year.

[United Press, Washington, 27th] President Truman today presented a message to Congress, putting forward an eleven-point plan. Truman asked for a special meeting of the Congress, which he criticized as "one of the worst in history," to enact price and salary control measures, rationing, and excess profits tax. He also warned that the fight against inflation cannot be stopped before the election. Truman also called for the passage of a comprehensive solution to the national housing shortage. Although Truman listed eleven points, he urged members to pay particular attention to anti-inflation and housing shortage proposals. Due to Republican opposition to a special summer session, Truman said, "High prices will not pause to watch the election, and high prices will not wait for the opening of the next Congress. This situation is getting worse day by day."

The secondary plans put forward by Truman include the Bill of Rights, federal government aid to education, raising the minimum wage, and expanding social security policies. Regarding human rights, President Zhu did not go into details, only stating that he would reiterate the Bill of Rights against lynching and anti-voting tax proposed in February. Equal employment for both blacks and whites, and the abolition of the bad habits of separating seats for blacks and whites on vehicles traveling between states: "I believe that in order to protect the authenticity of the Constitution, we must achieve the points I have previously proposed. I believe that Americans believe in freedom and equality, and must seek it in this direction."

### US Economic Stability and Prosperity are Tied to World Peace

The important parts of Truman's message are as follows: "The urgent needs of the American people make us meet here today. Our people ask the government to put forward legislation to do two things: first, to curb inflation and the rise in the cost of living, and second, to solve the housing shortage. These things affect every American family. What's more, world peace depends on our country's economic strength, and these things also affect the whole world.

"Domestic and foreign communists are waiting for our country to fall from its current prosperity into a recession. They do not believe that we will stop high prices, and they also hope for the collapse of the American economy. If we cannot control prices and bring about another recession, the hope for world peace will be lost. The free countries of Europe have suffered a lot, and the economic collapse of the United States will delay the recovery of the world, and this is the key to peace. If this tragedy occurs, we are really to blame."

### Prices Continue to Rise, People's Lives are Suffering

"At this time, our strength is being tested all over the world. If we cannot stop inflation, we will be terribly wrong. The cost of living now is unprecedented in history. Last year, a quarter of American families did not have enough income to cover their expenses. Families with low or medium incomes did not have enough money to buy many necessities at high prices. At the same time, industrial prices are also soaring. Industrial organizations with the ability to lead the national economy have recently announced large price increases. If we do not curb inflation, the result will be a sharp reduction in output and personnel, and the government will be powerless at that time. Therefore, I urge Congress to take strong and active action to control inflation."

### Curb Inflation and Take Effective Measures

"The plan I propose is as follows: First, re-levy the excess profits tax for a certain month to combat inflation. Second, restore consumer capital control to suppress inflation capital. Third, authorize the Federal Reserve to control inflationary bank capital. Fourth, authorize the government to control speculation in commodity transactions. Fifth, authorize the government to allocate and investigate rare items. Sixth, strengthen rent control and establish appropriate laws to enforce it, in order to prevent unreasonable rent increases. Seventh, authorize the government to ration products that are in short supply and are related to the people's health and well-being when necessary. However, this point may not need to be implemented as it is now. Eighth, the prices of rare items related to major industrial production or the cost of living should be controlled."

"Let me say again, there are many temporary profits that can offset wage increases without raising prices. We should continue to adopt free and cooperative buying and selling methods to achieve non-inflationary wage increases. The government sets a price limit, and the government does not intend to manage wage adjustments within the price limit, but if the salary increase makes the price limit invalid, the government will have to restrict it."

### Mutually Plan to Solve the Housing Shortage, Immigration Law Should Be Amended

"The second reason I called Congress is that the people hope that legislation will be made to deal with the national housing shortage. We urgently need low-priced houses so that people with middle incomes, especially veterans, can afford the rent. Senate Bill No. 866 is a very good housing bill, which was passed by the Senate on April 22. We need this bill, but now, not a year later." Truman then called on Congress to immediately pass education plans and other social policies, and said:

"Regarding the world, we should also take immediate action to show that we mean what we say and that we have confidence in freedom, humanity and international peace cooperation. This involves three methods: First, the current Displaced Persons Act is unfair in terms of religion and soil. The regulations of this act completely violate American ideals, and this act should be amended immediately. In addition, the current act only allows 200,000 people to enter the United States. I deeply feel that this act should stipulate that 400,000 people should enter the country within four years.

"Second, many people in the world say that we are desperately embracing the United Nations on the one hand, but we are not very generous with money to build its headquarters on the other. Therefore, we should immediately pass a law allowing the US government to loan money to build the United Nations headquarters in New York. The International Wheat Agreement is also a meeting and should be approved quickly."

### Three Countries Draft New Notes, Prepare to Negotiate with Soviet Foreign Minister

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: An diplomatic official said today that the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have decided to order the ambassadors of the three countries to the Soviet Union to personally propose suggestions to Molotov to resolve the Berlin crisis and other German issues.

It is said that this method is easier to reach an agreement than formal diplomatic notes. This can at least avoid another breakdown in formal diplomatic negotiations.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: The delegations of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have unanimously completed the agreement on a new response to the Soviet Union. At the same time, they have also unanimously agreed on a long-term strategy on how to deal with the Soviet Union's political offensive. Although this agreement still needs to be submitted to the governments of the three countries for individual approval.

[United Press, London, 27th] It is reported that after nearly 24 hours of continuous negotiations here among senior diplomatic representatives of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, a preliminary agreement has been reached today on the next suggestion to be presented orally to Molotov to resolve the Berlin issue. It is also learned that some US officials advocated presenting it directly to Stalin, but this was opposed by the United Kingdom and France. The United Kingdom and France warned that this action would lead to a showdown, which is not what Western European countries want. The British government has decided to cancel the plan for a full debate on the international situation on the 28th. Because the current situation is extremely tense, Foreign Secretary Bevin does not believe that he will answer questions about the Berlin crisis, especially during the negotiations here on the Soviet Union's notes. Sources familiar with the matter said that the full text of the new Soviet note can be prepared today, but warned that the Western Allies must prepare for a long-term exchange of letters with the Soviet Union before the Berlin or the entire German issue is resolved. They believe that although the result of this exchange of letters may be to convene a four-power conference, it will not be the case at present, because the United States has not yet agreed.

### Truman Takes the Initiative to Eliminate Racial Discrimination in the Federal Government, Ensuring Fair Employment Opportunities in the Military and Administrative Agencies

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] Truman today issued an order to take drastic steps to abolish racial discrimination in federal government employment issues and in the military. The President, by executive order, advocated the establishment of a Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Military directly under the President, and issued another order stipulating fair employment in federal government agencies. Southern Democrats had initially taken a rebellious stance, threatening that if the Republican Party put forward any human rights bill in the special Congress, the Southern Party would block it. Truman's joint promulgation of the order was to preemptively amend the fair employment and non-discrimination clauses in the military within the human rights section of the platform, without waiting for his political enemies to propose a bill. Truman said that it is very important to maintain higher democratic standards in the military, and that the policy of equal treatment and equal opportunities should be implemented as soon as possible.

### Britain and the United States Stop Cargo Transportation to Western Europe, Giving a Major Blow to the Soviet Economy

[United Press, Berlin, 27th] It is generally believed that the Western Allies are preparing to intensify their squeeze on the Soviet Union in the short term. After suspending railway transportation from the Soviet-occupied zone to Western Europe, they will continue to take similar actions. Senior officials pointed out that the Western Allies now believe that they are economically sufficient to retaliate against the Soviet Union in retaliation for the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. It is believed that after Clay arrives in Washington, he will decide to double the airlift. Therefore, with strong support, Clay may set new economic restrictions.

[United Press, Berlin, 27th] British and American authorities yesterday ordered a ban on railway transportation from Western Europe through the British and American occupied zones of Germany to the Soviet occupied zone. According to a British spokesman, the main impact of this move is on trade between the Soviet-occupied zone and Italy, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries. The statement of the ban also said that "international railway transportation through Germany will continue to pass", that is, trade between Western European countries and countries behind the Iron Curtain such as the Czech Republic, Poland, and the Balkan countries is not affected by this ban. The Kiel Canal, an important waterway between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, is still allowed to be used by the Soviet Union. It is reported that great attention is now being paid to the development of coastal traffic through the ports of Rostock and Stettin. Some people believe that this move is an attempt by Western countries to force the Soviet Union to lift the blockade of Berlin, or one of the first steps in imposing "economic sanctions" on the Soviet Union around the world.

### Over 300 Professors and Reporters in South Korea Oppose US Arming of Japan, and Demand that US and Soviet Troops Withdraw from Korea Simultaneously

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 27th] Three hundred and thirty South Korean professors, journalists, writers, lawyers, artists, and doctors issued a statement today opposing the US policy of rearming Japan, and demanding that the US and the Soviet Union withdraw from Korea simultaneously. In the statement signed by them and published today, these intellectuals condemned the US and the Soviet Union for dividing Korea, and the UK and the Soviet Union for their "colonial policies" towards Korea. They also declared that the independence of Korea cannot be separated, stating that Korea is currently the powder keg of the Far East.

### Marie's New Cabinet Final List, French Parliament Votes for Confidence, Bidault's Failure to Enter the Cabinet is Unexpected

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: Paris News: French Prime Minister Marie today urged Congress to vote for confidence in his new cabinet in order to avoid attacks from both the extreme left and the extreme right. The members of Marie's new cabinet are all pro-British and American, and there are no extreme left communists or extreme right de Gaulleists in it. It is also learned that the French Congress has rejected the proposal of the French Communist Party to debate the members of the cabinet by a majority of 357 votes to 197, and passed a vote of confidence in the Marie cabinet.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] Marie presented his list of cabinet members to the President late last night. Among the 28 cabinet members, the Radical Socialist Party occupies five seats, the Socialist Party six seats, the Popular Republican Party six seats, and the Independent Republican Party two seats. This list of cabinet members will be submitted to the National Assembly for approval. Since Marie has obtained the consent of the relevant parties, his passage is expected to be no problem. The difficulty that Marie had to overcome before presenting the final list was the differences of opinion with the Socialist Party on several points. According to informed sources, the Socialist Party does not agree with the nomination of Coste-Floret, a member of the People's Republican Party (erroneously written as Floret yesterday), as Minister of Overseas Territories. Here, it was previously believed that PlÃ©ven of the Democratic Socialist Union, a small party, was the most likely to take this position. The second point is the divergence of opinions on the candidates for the core cabinet. Marie originally planned to include two members of the Radical Socialist Party, two members of the Socialist Party, two members of the Popular Republican Party, and one member of the Independent Republican Party, but the Socialist Party had to strive for more representatives. After this concession, Marie finally agreed to include Socialist Minister of the Interior Moch and Radical Socialist Minister of Defense RenÃ© Mayer. After this concession, the Socialist Party agreed to Coste-Floret as Minister of Overseas Territories. The most noteworthy thing is that former Foreign Minister Bidault failed to occupy a seat in the new cabinet. Previously, the outside world unanimously speculated that he would definitely occupy a seat among the ministers of state, but unexpectedly he was not included.

### Korean National Assembly Rejects Yi Yun-yong as Prime Minister

Syngman Rhee's First Nomination Suffers Setback

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 27th] Republic of Korea President Syngman Rhee nominated Yi Yun-yong as Prime Minister of Korea, but was immediately rejected by the National Assembly. This was the first setback for Syngman Rhee in the National Assembly since he was elected president last week, and also shows the strength of the various political parties in the Korean National Assembly. Yi Yun-yong is the vice-chairman of the Korean Democratic Party, which is actually an underground organization in North Korea. When Syngman Rhee nominated and recommended him, he said: "Yi Yun-yong is the leader in the hell of the north. Therefore, he will definitely do his best to unify the northern half, which is what we sincerely hope." Yi Yun-yong is not related to the extreme right-wing Korean Democratic Party, nor is he related to the moderate elements of the Kim Gu faction.

### Hodge Scolds North Korean Elections as a Communist Deception

South Korean Regime Decides to Transfer Power to New Government

Seoul Dispatch: Hodge, the head of the U.S. military government stationed in South Korea, today issued a lengthy, thousand-word statement to the people of South Korea!

### George Bernard Shaw's Ninety-Second Birthday

Quietly Resides in the Countryside, Working as Usual

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] George Bernard Shaw celebrated his ninety-second birthday today, but as far as he's concerned, there's no need for celebration. He's working as usual in his small country cottage in Ayot St Lawrence, and his family doesn't dare mention his birthday. The only indication is that the inscription above the front door of his residence has been repainted.

â³ Announcement: Today's manuscript is exhausted; the "Dewey Responds to Aid Group" will continue to be judged tomorrow.

### UN Mediation Committee Submits Report Rebuking Dutch Blockade of Indonesia, An Act Clearly Violating the Ceasefire Agreement

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 26th, United Press] The United Nations Committee of Good Offices for Indonesia has rebuked the Dutch, stating that their armed forces have besieged the Republic of Indonesia, causing "serious" suffering to eighty million Indonesians. The Dutch currently have absolute control over Indonesia's trade, and their comprehensive blockade has resulted in a severe shortage of medicine, machinery, and other essential goods in the Republic of Indonesia. The Security Council is scheduled to study the reasons for the failure of mediation on the 27th. The Committee of Good Offices' report stated that the Dutch have besieged Indonesia throughout the six-month truce.

In its 2,000-word telegram, the Committee of Good Offices stated that the Dutch blockade of Indonesia is a clear violation of the agreement. This action has given the Dutch complete control over Indonesia, as all goods entering and leaving Indonesia require Dutch passports and must pass through Dutch checkpoints. All foreign exchange earned from exports is also taken by the Dutch. The vast majority of people in the Republic of Indonesia are now unable to engage in maritime trade, and different regions within the Republic of Indonesia are also unable to trade with each other.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 26th] The United Nations Security Council will reconvene on the 27th to consider the situation in Indonesia.

### Shibao Publications; Charity Sale for Education; Ten Magnificent Volumes in Fine Binding; Marked Price of One Billion Yuan

The minimum price is set at one billion yuan. The proceeds will not be deducted for any expenses and will all be donated to the "Reader Educational Aid Fund." The pictorials are supplements published by the former Shibao, starting with the first issue on January 1, 1934, and ending on July 1, 1937, with a total of 1,000 issues. The content includes sports, movies, art, current affairs, female figures, etc. All photos are printed on copperplate paper with exquisite binding. The entire set is bound in ten volumes, with gold-stamped leather covers, making them extremely exquisite. Collectors, connoisseurs, and artists all recognize their great value. Moreover, because the pictorials have been discontinued for eleven years, and due to natural disasters and man-made calamities over the years, it is feared that those remaining among the people will be lost. Today, Mr. Zhang is willing to part with them for the sake of poor students, and his spirit of philanthropy is admirable. The pictorials are now kept by the Educational Aid Fund Committee of this newspaper. Those interested in purchasing them can contact the Social Service Department at the office from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day.

### Shanghai-Qingdao Busts Subversive Organization; Confirmed Value of Supplies Reaches Hundreds of Billions; Twelve Key Criminals Arrested in Both Locations; Includes Boss of Baokang Electronic Science Company

The Garrison Headquarters recently busted a major case of supplying rebels with materials. Twelve suspected criminals were arrested in Shanghai and Qingdao, and the confirmed value of the supplies for the rebels is over hundreds of billions of yuan. In the Shanghai part of the case, the Electronic Surveillance Section of the Garrison Headquarters, based on confidential reports and clues obtained from breaking a secret radio station, learned that there was an organization of rebel transport agencies between Qingdao and Shanghai. Among those used by the rebels were soldiers, porters, sailors, and electrical material merchants who frequently traveled between Qingdao and Shanghai, using ships as transportation tools, searching for materials needed by the rebels in Shanghai, with wireless equipment being the largest. Others included Western medicines, etc., which were transported to Qingdao and sold at high prices to the rebel liaison personnel lurking in Qingdao, and then transported to the rebel areas near Qingdao. Taking the vacuum tube item transported between June and July alone, it reached more than 30 units, with a value of more than US$6,000. It was also found that these porters, etc., used by the rebels had contact with the boss of Baokang Electronic Material Company in this city. The Garrison Brigade was immediately joined and Wu Baokang and seven other related persons were detained a few days ago. From their confessions, more clues about Qingdao were obtained. The deputy captain of the Garrison Brigade, Yu Jiansheng, personally flew to Qingdao and joined the local public security agency to detain the five criminals in the Qingdao part (including the rebel liaison personnel in Qingdao). After completing the task, Deputy Captain Yu has returned to Shanghai to report. The Shanghai part of the case is being interrogated by the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters. The five criminals in the Qingdao part may also be escorted to Shanghai for joint handling in the next few days.

### Conference on Maintaining Public Utilities Decides on Important Remedial Measures Including Foreign Exchange Loans, Coal Prices, Fees, and More. Director Zhao Went to Nanjing Last Night to Consult with the Executive Yuan.

[Report from our newspaper] To save the crisis of public utilities in this city, the Municipal Government held a conference on maintaining Shanghai's public utilities in the conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu presided, and attendees included Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Ji, Luo Junshu, Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially dispatched to Shanghai by the central government, Yu Bingjian, representative of the Ministry of Communications, Luo Zhan, technical expert of the Ministry of Interior, Xu Baowei of the US Aid Utilization Committee, E.T. Bell of the US Economic Cooperation Administration in China, Zhang Xiwei, chairman of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Huo Shishu (representing Su Gongjun) of the Exporters Association, Mao Kegang of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Senators Xiang Changquan, Wang Zhuyi, Jiang Li, Shao Yongsheng, Tang Chengzong, Xu Xueyu, and Chu Shun, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue, and representatives from various public utility companies.

Comparison of Various Index Increases

First, Mayor Wu clarified the significance of convening the meeting, followed by Director Zhao's report on the multiples of various index increases from January 1 to July 24 of this year: (1) US dollar exchange rate, 45.9 times; (2) Material oil, 37.2 times; (3) Heavy diesel, 34.5 times; (4) Medium diesel, 38.4 times; (5) Light diesel, 38.8 times; (6) Gasoline, 50 times; (7) Coal, 14.6 times; (8) Cost of living index, 14.5 times. The multiples of public utility increases are as follows: (1) Electricity, 8.5 times for those using 10 degrees or less, 11.4 times for those using 11 to 30 degrees, and 14.2 times for those using over 30 degrees; (2) Power, 13.1 times; (3) Water, 12.7 times. According to the above statistics, it is proved that the price of public utilities is actually less than the increase in prices, and various companies are almost unable to maintain their operations due to lack of working capital. At yesterday's meeting, representatives of Shanghai Electric Power, Telephone, French Concession Tram and Electric Light, Shanghai Waterworks, British Tram, and Inner City Waterworks, respectively, stated the difficulties of their companies before leaving to allow the municipal authorities to discuss solutions.

Obtaining Loans from the Central Bank

The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. Afterwards, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue reported the three remedial measures decided upon at the meeting: (1) Fuel oil and gasoline: US aid oil can be used starting in August, and the price should be adjusted once a month as the standard. Before that, it was agreed with President Yu to provide a one-time foreign exchange settlement for public utility oil and request the central government to exempt public utility oil from tariffs and import surcharges. (2) Coal prices are determined to be adjusted once a month in principle. The monthly supply of coal for Shanghai is limited to 45,900 tons. The required mine price and freight must be paid in full within three days after the monthly announcement. As for coal payments, if the company is unable to bear it, the Central Bank can lend the money. The payment method stipulates that coal from Kailuan be paid to the Central Trust Bureau for collection, coal from East China be paid to the Xuzhou branch of the Central Bank for collection, coal from Huainan be paid to the Bengbu branch of the Central Bank for collection, and coal from Taiwan be paid to the Shanghai branch of the Bank of Taiwan for collection. Coal supply is borne separately by various places, including 20,000 tons from Kailuan, 5,900 tons from East China, 10,000 tons from Huainan, and 10,000 tons from Taiwan. (3) Various special taxes, such as the Self-Defense Special Tax, are to be fixed by the Municipal Government telegraphing the North China authorities. There are also insurance fees and labor costs, etc., which account for about 10% and have not yet been fixed. The total coal payment is about 3 trillion, and a loan from the Central Bank is requested. The Central Bank has expressed its willingness to find ways to help. In the future, when various companies lack working capital, they can also request a loan from the Central Bank, which must be repaid within at least three months.

New Prices Announced on the First of Each Month

The most prolonged discussion concerned the issue of adjusting the sales prices of public utilities in August. In the past, the adjustment of prices for this month was based on an automatic method, in which the cost prices of various items were those announced in the previous month, resulting in greater losses for the company. It is now decided that the cost prices of various items will be determined in advance at the end of each month, and will remain unchanged for one month. As for the cost of living index and the hardware index, it is decided to first increase them by 50% based on what has already been reported this month. In this way, new prices for various public utilities can be announced simultaneously on the first of each month. Large users of electricity and water will be charged every half month. As for the company's request to adjust prices every half month, it was not approved in order to avoid stimulating price increases.

The new method for adjusting the prices of public utilities still needs to be approved by the central government before it can be implemented. Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue is scheduled to go to Nanjing tonight, carrying a written request for the Executive Yuan to approve the loan amounts for public utilities, which will then be lent by the Central Bank.

### Arson and Burning of Pawnshop Case: Lu Zimei Prosecuted

[Report from our newspaper] The case of the Qiaoxing Pawnshop on Fuxing Middle Road in this city being set on fire by employee Lu Zimei, resulting in the death of five people in the fire, has been concluded by the District Prosecutor's Office. He has been prosecuted for the crimes of endangering public safety and murder. The defendant had previously worked at the pawnshop for five years. Recently, due to the poor business of the shop, it was preparing to close down and had laid off several employees, including Lu. He initially received 4 million yuan in severance pay, followed by another 5 million yuan. The total amount was still insufficient for the defendant's travel expenses to return to his hometown in Sichuan. Although the defendant repeatedly requested an increase, he was ultimately rejected by Xu Songjia, the manager of the shop. At 4:00 AM on the 8th of this month, the defendant was lying alone in the shop on the ground floor, feeling anxious about his unemployment and even more resentful of the owner's ruthlessness. Overwhelmed by worry and resentment, he suddenly had an evil thought. He immediately opened two cans of kerosene, spilled it on old newspapers, and lit them. The flames shot straight up. By the time the defendant escaped from the shop and shouted in regret, it was too late to save the situation. Gao Jianqing, the assistant manager who lived upstairs, and his family members Gao Zhongding, Gao Yongsan, Gao Maomao, and maid Shi Jubao were unable to escape and all died. Most of the Qiaoxing Pawnshop was burned down. Knowing that his crime was unforgivable, the defendant surrendered himself to the Songshan Police Precinct and was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. The investigation has now concluded, and he has been prosecuted.

### Kidnapping of Overseas Chinese from the Philippines for Ransom Case: Urging the Plaintiff to Return Home to Testify. Defendant Su Wanlei Remanded After Retrial Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] Su Wandang, the bodyguard of Li Xiaojin, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman from the Philippines, who was accused of kidnapping Li Antai, Li Xiaojin's eldest son, and extorting 1 million Philippine pesos, was sentenced by Judge Zhong Xianda of the Fifth Criminal Court of the District Court on March 6 of this year, after more than a year of arrest and investigation. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the crime of assisting in kidnapping for ransom. The defendant appealed to the High Court through his defense lawyer Zheng Lin, arguing that the court had not considered the strong evidence of the withdrawal of the prosecution and the arrest warrant by the Philippine Prosecutor's Office. On April 24, Yi Zhiding, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the High Court, ruled that "the truth cannot be clarified without directly trying Li Antai in the case" and remanded the case for retrial. On the 12th of last month, Judge Ou Shenghe of the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court opened the trial and summoned Pei Nandis, a Philippine court defense lawyer who flew from the Philippines to Shanghai, and witness Xie Shiqing to testify. Yesterday afternoon, the case was retried in the District Court. The defendant's lawyer submitted the original text and translation of the Philippine Prosecutor's Office's withdrawal of the prosecution and the arrest warrant. The court stated that the person involved had not appeared in court and could not be tried, and instructed Yao Yongli, the lawyer representing the person involved, to telegraph Li Antai to return home to testify. The trial will be conducted again after Li arrives in Shanghai. The defendant remains in custody.

### Director of the Social Affairs Department of the Fujian Provincial Government, Cao Tingguang, Reports on the Disaster Situation. Millions of Disaster Victims Eagerly Awaiting Assistance from All Sectors

[Report from our newspaper] Liu Gongyun, Yang Chuoan, Jiang Yong, and other Fujianese people in Shanghai, in order to make all sectors of this city understand the truth about the serious floods in Fujian, specially invited reporters to the Central Bank at 6:00 PM yesterday, where Cao Tingguang, Director of the Social Affairs Department of the Fujian Provincial Government, reported on the detailed disaster situation.

However, the disaster is extremely severe. Millions of disaster victims have been displaced and their lives are in dire straits. They are in urgent need of help. A large amount of disaster relief funds is essential. The provincial government and the provincial assembly have decided to send one representative each to Nanjing to request disaster relief. I was sent to Shanghai and Nanjing this time to handle this matter. However, this matter is of great importance and relies on the direct and indirect guidance and assistance of all parties in order to complete the task.

### Training Work in Luoshan County

â Time News Reporter Zhai Nianji

After leaving Xinyang, as the truck entered Luoshan County, the first thing that caught my eye was the desolate fields on both sides of the road, and the weeds swaying in the morning breeze. Occasionally, there were remnants of walls and broken tiles, making people feel particularly desolate after the war.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Luoshan County was a contested area between the enemy and us. In the fierce seesaw battle, countless fields and villages were turned into rubble. Luoshan County, with a population of more than 300,000, had only 180,000 to 190,000 people left. After the victory, this place was repeatedly invaded by the communist bandits in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border area, and resisted Liu Fei Bocheng's siege once. The situation of local destruction was even more serious. However, the local farmers, with the assistance and support of the government and the United Relief, perseveringly rebuilt their homes and country on the ruins. The closer the car got to the county seat, the more successful the land reclamation and reconstruction work became, which shows that under the large-scale destructive atrocities of the communist bandits, the people can only rely on the government's protection and political support to complete the reconstruction of the countryside. Recently, the population of Luoshan County has increased to 210,000 to 220,000.

Luoshan County is a rice-producing area in southeastern Henan. Luoshan rice not only supplies the heavily garrisoned Xinyang, but also a portion is transported to Hankou. The largest and most numerous businesses in the county seat are rice shops. The commercial vehicles on the Xinyang-Luoshan Highway mostly carry passengers to Luoshan and then carry rice back to Xinyang. The cars can make a round trip once a day, so the rice merchants will not suffer losses due to the price fluctuations in the Xinyang market. The owners of the commercial vehicles are already satisfied with the profits from the rice freight, and passengers are just "extra money." "Rice transportation" maintains the traffic between Xinyang and Luoshan, and promotes the prosperity of Luoshan County.

A Brave Team

Zhang Yulong, the magistrate of Luoshan County, was the deputy commander of the county's regular self-defense force in the past. He has been acting as the county magistrate for less than half a year. In the continuous harassment and attacks by the local communist bandit Luo Houfu in the Hubei-Henan border area, he has trained the self-defense force into a brave and good-fighting iron army. In the border areas of the bandit area, only military force can be used to protect politics, and politics can be used to develop the economy. Then, the overall strength of military, political, and economic forces can be used to suppress the bandits. Therefore, cultivating local armed forces is the most basic part of the pacification work.

The reporter had a three-hour conversation with Magistrate Zhang at the county government office. He told the reporter many valuable experiences about organizing and training local teams. He pointed out the two basic reasons that currently affect the combat effectiveness of local teams: one is that the commanders take advantage of vacancies, or use the vacancies to subsidize public funds; the other is that they assign the troops to county government and local miscellaneous affairs, such as urging recruits, urging payments, collecting grain, and collecting taxes. Moreover, some allocate soldiers of the troops to serve as orderlies for senior officials of the county government and local gentry. Therefore, he put forward the slogan of sufficient soldiers and sufficient food to the local public opinion organs. "Sufficient soldiers" means not taking advantage of vacancies and not assigning miscellaneous affairs, but concentrating on training soldiers and fighting wars. "Sufficient food" means that food and salaries must be allocated according to the actual number of people in the regular self-defense force. How to ensure that vacancies are not taken advantage of and prevent them from being taken advantage of? The method is that the photos of all team cadres and soldiers should be pasted on the roster, and the local council and fair gentry should count the names when distributing food and salaries. The team guarantees that there are no missing soldiers, and the local guarantees that there is no shortage of food. Sufficient soldiers and sufficient food are the minimum basic conditions for reorganizing and training local teams.

Magistrate Zhang also pointed out that in fighting with the communist bandits, it is necessary to deeply understand the bandit's guerrilla tactics. Only by understanding the enemy can we defeat the enemy. Moreover, guerrilla warfare is a tactic of dealing with superior equipment with inferior equipment. The equipment of local teams may not be better than that of the communist bandits, so they should also use the bandit's guerrilla tactics to attack the communist bandits. For example, mobile attacks are used to annihilate small groups of remnant bandits with superior forces and capture all their weapons and soldiers to supplement themselves. Another example is to use long-distance night marches to penetrate more than a hundred miles into the bandit area to eat up the local armed forces and small units of their rural public offices, as well as to use the communist bandits' usual tactics such as flanking maneuvers. Therefore, the main content of the training is the communist bandits' guerrilla tactics. In combat, they should be given back to them in the same way. This has caused Luo Fei Houfu to suffer great losses repeatedly on the border of Luoshan.

The Characteristics of County Training Work

The regular self-defense force is a pillar of law and order, while the mass self-defense force is the bricks and tiles that build it. The mass self-defense force is the total gathering of manpower in the county. It is the eyes and ears of the regular self-defense force and the most powerful helper. The application of guerrilla tactics depends on whether the mass organization and training are strict or not. Therefore, organizing and training the mass self-defense force, which holds knives, sticks, spears, and spears, and is responsible for communication, intelligence, checking, and sentry, is a great force to eliminate potential bandits in the territory and cooperate with the regular force in combat. Therefore, the organization and training of Luoshan's mass self-defense force and the organization and training of the regular force are equally important and carried out in coordination.

In order to consolidate the law and order of the entire county, Magistrate Zhang completed the five phases of the county political training class in one phase. The training of more than one hundred trainees in the county training institute was not carried out in the classroom, but a township was designated, and then the training was carried out step by step according to the training subjects that should be carried out in each Jia and Bao. That is, the trainees are trained in practice. This is tantamount to a large working group. On the one hand, it can play a demonstrative role in the training work, and on the other hand, it has thoroughly completed the work of checking household registration, organizing Baojia, clearing land, and eliminating traitors. This is a feature of Luoshan County's training work.

The Serious Land Problem

The serious situation of Luoshan's desolate land was the reporter's first impression when he stepped into Luoshan County. According to Magistrate Zhang, after the victory, "United Relief" had carried out land reclamation work on both sides of the highway. After the end of United Relief, the Fifth Appeasement District Headquarters coordinated with the Luoshan County Government to organize a land reclamation brigade and handle immigration, but the lack of manpower and financial resources still could not solve the problem of wasteland. In this situation of vast land and sparse population, land distribution should not be a problem. However, according to the results of the reporter's visit to the countryside, the landlords in Bashan County still collect land rent from the tenant farmers at a rate of five-five division. Because the landlords not only hold the ownership of the land, but also hold the agricultural tools and power necessary for cultivation. Because they occupy land and means of production, they can sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor without working. Therefore, the land problem in the Appeasement District [should] be [the] main content, one is how to reclaim wasteland, two is how to carry out rent reduction and interest reduction to improve the lives of individual farmers, and three is how to re-reasonably distribute land and abolish the tenancy system. Wasteland reclamation and expansion [are] limited to human and financial resources and must be done gradually. Land reform must be implemented after the government promulgates laws and regulations. However, rent reduction and interest reduction can be realized immediately as long as the local governments are determined. The problem lies in how to overcome the obstruction of the local land rights and the understanding and confidence of the local magistrate in rent reduction.

### Lack of Communication in Qingpu's Bandit Suppression Unfortunate Incident Occurs in the Middle of the Night

[Report from our Qingpu correspondent on the 26th] Recently, bandits have been active in the strategically important Sao Gouan area of the Qingxi Waterway, and robbery cases have been frequently reported. On the night of the 25th, when the Zhujiege and Anzhuang Township People's Defense Teams went to search the area, they encountered the People's Defense Team patrolling in nearby Xicen Township. Because there was no prior communication, the two sides mistakenly identified each other as bandits in the dark, and a fierce battle lasted for about an hour before they realized the misunderstanding. However, Guo Hengbin, a member of the Xicen People's Defense Team, was killed on the spot by a machine gun, and one member of the Xicen Water Team was seriously injured. A civilian ship was also damaged. The county government has sent personnel to Baodi to investigate this unfortunate incident of misunderstanding in bandit suppression.

### Changzhou Miscellaneous News: Searching for Bandit Bullets Beside the Bodhisattva, Prisoners Encouraged to Reform Outside Prison

[Special Dispatch from Wujin, this Newspaper, 25th] The cost for each national identification card issued by the government is 35,000 yuan.

The number of troops participating in the suppression of bandits, including the National Army, provincial and county security teams, and civilian self-defense forces, is more than ten times that number. Despite repeated deadlines for complete elimination, the suppression remains incomplete. On the 23rd, a batch of bandit ammunition was found on the body of a Bodhisattva in the Xishe Temple in Lincheng Township, at the border of Wucheng: seventeen sticks of dynamite, one smoke grenade, and one pound of explosives, were taken to the county for investigation.

In previous conscriptions in Changzhou, the settlement allowance borne by the people ranged from 10 to 30 shi of rice per person. Averaging 20 shi of rice per person, the total amount has exceeded the annual land tax of the entire county.

The overdue taxes for the 35th and 36th years are being actively urged and collected. The prison grain in the new prison is depleted, and prisoners are being released on parole for reform as much as possible!

Tomorrow's Opening Ceremony Will Be Unprecedentedly Grand

[United Press, London, 27th] The World Cup lasts for two weeks, and all the competitions will be in full swing. In terms of the grandeur of the scene, the opening ceremony on the 29th cannot be compared to any competition. In the afternoon, 80,000 spectators in the stands will be waiting for the arrival of King George VI of England. The President of the International Olympic Committee will accompany the King to his seat, and the entire audience will sing the British national anthem. Afterwards, the national teams, led by their national flags and national shields, will parade around the field, passing in front of the King in solemn salute. According to World Cup tradition, Greece ranks first among all nations, and the remaining nations are arranged alphabetically, while the United Kingdom is at the rear as the host country. After the athletes from each country circle the field for one week, they will line up in multiple rows, facing the honorary command platform. At that time, the Chairman of the Organizing Committee will meet with the King to ask the King to deliver a speech. The King will give the following speech, announcing the opening of the World Cup: "I hereby announce to the public that the 1948 World Sports Games have begun, which is the 14th World Games of modern times."

After a short break, as bugles sounded and salutes were fired, the last person in the torch relay entered the field from the east gate, stepped across the track, and lit the World Cup flame with the torch in his hand. This lamp will burn day and night and will only be extinguished after the World Cup is over. At that time, the World Cup flag will slowly rise, and thousands of pigeons will also spread their wings and fly. According to ancient Greek custom, pigeons were released into the air to notify all cities whenever the Olympics began, and this custom has been used to this day. Then the British captain, holding the British flag, took the lead in approaching the honorary command platform. The flag bearers of other countries also went to the front of the platform to take an oath around the British captain. The oath is as follows: "We solemnly swear that we will participate in the World Games with the spirit of glorious competition, vowing to obey the constitution, adhere to the spirit of sports, strive for glory for the country, and work hard for sports.

### Main Player of the World Cup Basketball Team, Li Shiqiao, Stays in Singapore Due to Illness: Various Parties in the City Cannot Confirm

[Our Report] According to a report published in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post on the 27th, the Chinese World Cup basketball star Li Shiqiao is currently ill in Singapore and was unable to travel to London with the team. Shiqiao is scheduled to rush there before the games, but it is not yet known if he will be able to make it. This news was revealed by Huang Tianxi, who also said that the basketball team is currently in intensive training, and even if Li Shiqiao can arrive before the games, the Chinese team has suffered a great loss. For this reason, our reporter specially inquired with relevant parties in the city yesterday, hoping to obtain some information about Li Shiqiao's actual situation, but none of the relevant parties could confirm this. However, it is true that Li Shiqiao is ill in Singapore. It is unheard of that he did not go to London. In recent days, the Central News Agency's reports from Singapore and London have not mentioned it. We can only wait for more detailed reports. However, according to the Central News Agency's report from London, the Chinese basketball team lost to Egypt, and Shiqiao was not there, which may also be a reason, but the telegram did not mention it at all. The English-language Shanghai Evening Post also stated that Gao Lan athlete Huang Liangzheng suffered from severe toothache.

### A Talk on Denture Experience

â Feng Zikai

When a person reaches fifty, they are left with seventeen teeth, loose and shaky, unfit for use. Upon the diligent advice of Dr. Yi Zhaoxue, the dentist, all were extracted, and a full set of dentures was fitted. Fortunately, Dr. Yi's skills are highly refined, and there was no pain during the extraction. The dentures fitted are also aesthetically pleasing and natural to use, capable of chewing stir-fried soybeans and peanuts. However, for the first month after fitting, there was some discomfort. Only afterward did I realize that this "discomfort" was entirely due to "unfamiliarity." With patient use for a month, one will definitely find it completely comfortable due to "habit." I deeply fear that those without this experience will lament the hardship and difficulty at first, regretting it before it's too late, or blaming the dentist for not fitting them well. Therefore, I am sharing my own experience to inform fellow sufferers. For I myself initially lamented the hardship, regretted it, and doubted Dr. Yi Zhaoxue's skills when I first had my dentures fitted; only after a month did I realize it was all unjust grievance, and I felt apologetic and infinitely grateful. The reasons why "habit" can make dentures comfortable are stated below:

Dentures are based on the gums, with teeth-like hard objects attached to the gums. In normal people, the duty of the gums is to support the teeth, making the teeth grow firmly in the mouth like tree trunks. Therefore, the gums are strongest at the roots of the teeth and very weak on the surface. When picking teeth with a toothpick, using too much force can sometimes cause the surface of the gums to bleed. This is proof that the surface of the gums is very weak. As long as the gums at the roots of the teeth use their strength to hold the teeth, the teeth can exert force to bite hard things.

Now that you have extracted all your teeth, the gums at the roots of the teeth no longer need to fulfill the duty of support. Let the gums on the surface contract and fill the holes from the extractions, and then resist the hard base of the dentures. In this way, the strong part of the gums resigns its duty, while the weak part takes on a heavy responsibility. It is like a person who has always been idle suddenly taking on a heavy job, definitely feeling very painful! So on the first day dentures are fitted, when you chew tightly, the upper and lower gums are oppressed by the base, causing great pain. Fearing the pain, you can only avoid chewing tightly; without chewing tightly, even rice grains cannot be crushed, let alone hard objects. At this time, you will regret the extractions and blame the dentist for incompetence. Becoming impatient, you remove the newly fitted dentures, preferring to gnaw rice with your gums. But this is a temporary expedient, not a good solution. Because if this continues, you will never wear the dentures, and then you will truly regret it. I tell you, the first two or three days of fitting are a crucial juncture. These two or three days require the greatest patience. During these two or three days, you can only eat soft things. If you eat vegetarian food, tofu, bean curd sheets, fermented bean curd, sesame paste, peanut butter, etc., can all be eaten. If you eat meat, eggs, fish slices, braised pork, etc., can all be eaten, and the nutrition is not lacking. Temporarily avoid bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and ribs such as chicken, duck, and pork. What does it matter?

Enduring for three days, on the fourth day you will definitely be able to eat slightly harder things. My experience is to eat walnuts. Walnuts are harder than rice, softer than peanuts, and I think they are the most suitable test material. Chew slowly. Take a small piece of walnut the size of a soybean and carefully place it in the middle of the molars, have the molars bite down, and then chew tightly. One, two, three, four, chew at the same speed as the movements of calisthenics. Eventually, the walnut will be chewed to pieces, and you will feel the fragrant, oily, and smooth taste. This is the first tribute you receive from dentures, the beginning of sweetness after hardship. Besides walnuts, dry biscuits and pastries (such as Zhuangyuan Pastry, Xiang Pastry) are also good test materials. Chewing them makes a "sasha" sound, which can also enhance the power of dentures. Guided by walnuts, biscuits, pastries, and other things, slowly eat harder things. After a month or two, you can eat peanuts and stir-fried soybeans.

I have been wearing dentures for more than half a year now, and I am completely accustomed to them, using them naturally, unable to distinguish them from real teeth. Here I have realized a point: the number of organs in the human body is not fixed. If from ancient times God had only given people one hand and one foot, people would have become accustomed and satisfied, and would not demand two hands and two feet. Similarly, if from ancient times God had not given people a nose, and people had never smelled fragrances and odors, they would have become accustomed and satisfied, and would not demand a nose. From a more positive perspective, if from the beginning God had given people an extra organ on their heads called X, and this X could hear distant sounds, like a modern radio, people would become accustomed to this organ and consider it something they should naturally have, and consider its absence a disease. If from ancient times God had given people a pair of wings on their backs, allowing them to take off at any time, like modern airplanes, people would become accustomed to this organ and consider it something they should naturally have, and consider its absence a disability. It can be seen that the organs of the human body can be more or less, originally without a fixed number. Therefore, people who are missing an eye are as sensitive as we are after getting used to it. People who are missing a leg walk as fast as we do after getting used to it. I have seen people with only two fingers on each hand, who can still pick things up, write, and even play the piano because they are used to it. I have met people with no hands at all, who can actually count banknotes and play dominoes with their toes because they are used to it. It can be seen that the number of organs in the human body is not fixed, and it becomes natural after getting used to it. Suppose from the beginning God had not created teeth for people, and teeth had to be fitted by a craftsman, then I would be an ordinary healthy person, because I can chew things just like you!

I often think like this, so I am very satisfied with my dentures. So I wrote down this experience and thoughts and hung it in Dr. Yi Zhaoxue's clinic, and widely informed fellow sufferers in the world. (July of the thirty-seventh year in Hangzhou.)

### Big Fish Eats Small Fish

â Wu Jiren

In the spring, the fish in the tank all spawn, and watching them go from breaking out of the egg to birth, it doesn't take long for them to gradually grow from a mosquito larva-like size. However, the development of small fish varies in speed. If you let them live and die on their own, and the fish foodâwater fleasâis not provided sufficiently, they will engage in the survival of the fittest, and the larger ones will devour those smaller than themselves. Fish have no spiritual awareness. Whether they are of the same kind, the same clan, or even eating from the same container, they only want to fill their stomachs for their own benefit, prolong their lives temporarily, and disregard everything else.

The goldfish in the tank can sometimes be caught and selected by people to separate them by size, putting the large ones with the large ones and the small ones with the small ones, so that they can live in peace for a while.

The small fish in the tank are like this, and so are the fish and shrimp in the rivers and seas. Fortunately, aquatic creatures grow and flourish abundantly, so even with such mutual slaughter, they still reproduce endlessly. The survival of the fittest is indeed the principle of natural selection. Please look at the international arena and society. In all the places where people interact with each other, where is the survival of the fittest and mutual slaughter not revealed?

### Skimming Oil

â Suobei

Skimming oil is actually malfeasance. If the four large characters on the roof of the International Hotel were still around, skimming oil would be a huge stain on individuals and society; however, according to recent urban sentiments, skimming oil seems to have been recognized by everyone as "normal human behavior." Those who are slightly worldly-wise will probably not raise objections because shops evade stamp duties or ticket sellers do not give tickets; moreover: "This isn't skimming your oil! What business is it of yours?" Furthermore: "Life is so expensive!" Shanghai dialect calls this kind of person who is good at understanding human emotions and knowledgeable of the world as "luo kan" or "shixiang."

As a result, skimming oil became popular in Shanghai after the victory, from bottom to top. Authoritative institutions unanimously (or successively) refused to pay various fees such as water, electricity, gas, and telephone from August of the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China; and because they can continue to enjoy these services without paying fees, they use them without reservation and extremely lavishly; therefore, when this bill is calculated today, it has already dragged more than a dozen circles below the character "one" (this number has not been calculated according to the past currency value indexed).

The company authorities have two magic weapons: sacrificing the weak and appeasing people. You skim oil, I raise prices; I added a line of red text to the bills of citizen users: "If not paid before a certain date in a certain month, supply will be stopped immediately without further notice." Thus, the problem was solved, from victory to this day.

The company's view on skimming oil is also somewhat similar to the general public's view on ticket sellers skimming oil: "You skim oil! Anyway, you can't skim it from me. Why not be generous with other people's money?"

### "Jiejie" and "Zijie"

â You Mojun

Students often write "jiejie" when referring to their older sisters in their papers. Someone asked me if the characters "jie" and "zi" are interchangeable. I said that as long as a character is used habitually, there is no need to ask whether they are interchangeable. For example, the "ball" in "piqiu" (leather ball) originally had the "mao" (fur) radical, while the "yu" (jade) radical means "jade"; however, no one is heard saying "qiu" now, which is clear evidence. Moreover, "jie" is seen in Zhai Hao's Common Customs Compilation of the Qing Dynasty, which says: "In recent times, older sisters are called jie," which is like "die" and "ba," why delve into it! As for "zi," it is seen in Shuowen, because Master Xu's book is the orthodox source of characters, so people always abide by it, even to this day.

Adding "xiao" (little) before "jie" to call someone "xiaojie" (miss) is especially fashionable now, like flight attendants and so on, which are countless. According to Qian Weiyan's Jade Hall Encounter Records, there was a palace servant in charge of tea and wine named Han Xiaojie. The term "xiaojie" first appeared here, but it is a person's name, not a title. The following sentences are quite incomprehensible, because Han is her surname, and xiaojie is clearly a title rather than a person's name. Qian was a person of the Song Dynasty, so the term "xiaojie" already existed as a title in the Song Dynasty. To say it even more "anciently," Fan Qin and Cao Pi's Letter to Shi Nu has the phrase "Shina jiejie," which notes that she was a musician at the time. Kai Tian Yi Shi: Prince Ning had a courtesan named Jie. Tao Yi's Qing Yi Lu has Pingkang prostitute Zui Jie, and Su Shi's Collection includes courtesan Yang Jie, all of which are seen in the Common Customs Compilation. Based on this, the title "jie" was already common between the Wei and Tang Dynasties. Adding "xiao" before "jie" is nothing more than expressing petite intentions. Therefore, the Ming Dynasty poet Zhu Youdun has the line "Three-inch lotus shoes revealed before the curtain, knowing that the tender miss has come." "Tender" is the name, "miss" is the title. The Common Customs Compilation considers "jie to be a very lowly term, and only daughters of noble families can be called that, which is contradictory." This is an outdated view, because calling young women "jie" or "xiaojie" is like calling "mei" (younger sister) or "xiaomei" (little sister), and is not exclusive to daughters of noble families. I wonder if readers think so.

The term "zijie" appears in poetry, as seen in Tang Dynasty Sima Biao Sheng's poem: "Elder sister teaches people to hold the child."

### Tidbits from the West

â Xian Si

Quinine is most effective for treating malaria, but unfortunately, its taste is very bitter. Accidentally crushing the sugar coating is simply unbearably bitter. Soviet scientists, in view of this, have already been feeding quinine (plants) to bees. Patients only need to eat the honey produced by these bees to treat the disease, and there is no bitter taste.

The average lifespan of a car produced in recent years is twelve years, and it can be driven 100,000 miles.

Although the United States is experiencing a housing shortage, the trend of moving is not declining. In the eight years since 1940, 12 million people have moved from one state to another; 13 million have remained in the same state but moved to another county; and 44 million have moved within the same county. In other words, in a short period of less than ten years, almost half of the entire population of the United States has moved.

At the upcoming World Games in London, there will be a special camera at the finish line of the track events that can carefully photograph the order in which each athlete arrives at the moment they cross the white line, without any ambiguity. The photo can be printed within ninety seconds after the photo is taken for judges to refer to.

### Dwelling in the Lower Reaches

â Gongsun Wu

Confucius said in the Analects, "The wickedness of Zhou was not as extreme as that; therefore the superior man hates to dwell in the lower reaches, to which all the wickedness in the world will flow." Zigong was a wise man, and Confucius approved of him as someone who could discuss poetry with. Pondering these words, I also know that he could discuss history. What the term "lower reaches" refers to is not easy to explain in detail, but it means anything that can be blamed. This is a different meaning from the "dwelling in the lower reaches" among the four evils of the superior man. Zhou was unkind, but not extremely wicked. If not for Zigong, who would clear his name? Historical writing is not always impartial, and people's words often exaggerate evil. Moreover, the world still has those who are not unkind but merely bear the name, and people hate them because of their name, so they attribute all the wickedness in the world to them. Therefore, the superior man knows this and always refrains from doing certain things. Yi Yin governed by advancing, and caused chaos by advancing. He went to Tang five times and to Jie five times. The situation was extremely dangerous, but fortunately, the ancients were forgiving and praised him for being able to take on responsibility. Otherwise, if he was charged with being an accomplice to evil once, and with being fickle twice, and was thoroughly purged, with his merits not making up for his faults, would he still be able to be called a sage? This is why Confucius did not become the ruler of Wei, and ultimately did not attach himself to Gongshan Buliao or Fufou, and had discussions about avoiding the world, avoiding places, avoiding lust, and avoiding words. Zigong made his fortune by trading without being commanded, truly seeing that politics cannot be forced. Only Yan Hui was happy in poverty. Ran Qiu accumulated wealth for the Ji family, increasing the grain levy twofold compared to other days. Although he was not enriching himself, he could not escape the attacks that were as loud as beating drums, which is also an example of dwelling in the lower reaches.

â Original by Tennyson, Translated by Bi

Moss, how deep! Covering all the flower mounds. Pear blossoms on the wall, Falling nails producing red rot. The dilapidated house, colors bleak, Door sills daily in the door. Carved upon it, a lone warehouse is seen, Upon the warehouse, all ãã.

Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. Evening dew produces tear drops, When the dew dries, tears come again, All day the sky is clear, But the heart fears to look. In the dusk bats fly, Faintly entering the long dusk, But drawing the small chain, Gazing fixedly towards the dark crossing.

Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. In the middle of the night, unable to sleep, Night birds sounding solemnly. The rooster crows, the morning is still far, In the dark pond, a calf's moo is heard. Thinking that life is ended, like what? Like a lonely traveler spending the night. Until the cold wind comes, Dawn light rises upon the cut-off roof.

Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. Moss stains on the wall, deep, The water in the ditch outside the wall, black; The white poplar tree at the corner of the wall, Standing alone, empty on all sides. The four sides, how vast, Cold sun pressing near! Frost skin covering the branches, Pale, as its color.

Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. The bright moon sinks to the great corner, High wind ãdistant scholars. Asking the woman what she sees? A plain curtain dancing empty. A good night åå£ already broken, Turning ãentering the rugged slope; Dust bed extending tree shadows, White poplar tree crossing the brows.

Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. The door sill echoes the chamber, Green flies sing on the window screens, Wall rats whistle, In the hole, looking çç. Passing light crosses the door gap, As if the face of an old person; Belly sounds in the high building, Cries issue in the front yard.

Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. The clock slowly ticks, Migratory birds chirp in the beams; Moreover, the white poplar wind, Rustling, makes the heart rebel. Zhu Yang suddenly declines to the west, Red cheeks increasingly embarrassed! Remaining light enters the chamber, In the middle, traces of tiny dust are seenâ¦â¦

Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler never comes. Long crying, life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass!
