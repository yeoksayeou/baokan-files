[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Capital Garrison Headquarters, on the 10th, received an order from President Chiang, stating that in order to maintain the security and order of the capital region, temporary martial law should be declared immediately. Sun Lianzhong, the Commander-in-Chief, convened relevant personnel for consultation on the evening of the 10th and decided that temporary martial law would be implemented in the entire Capital Garrison District (east to Shanghai, west to Anqing, south to Hangzhou, north to Bengbu) starting from midnight on the 10th. From 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM every night thereafter, martial law would be in effect. During this time, all actions should be carried out in accordance with Article 11 of the Martial Law Act, and a Martial Law Headquarters would be established immediately, starting operations on the 11th. The Nanjing municipal area had already been repeatedly announced to citizens through time announcements after 6:00 PM on the 10th.

[Another Dispatch] Capital Garrison Commander-in-Chief Sun Lianzhong issued a statement as follows: The military situation of suppressing bandits throughout the country is becoming increasingly tense. The Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign has already begun. Our national forces are deployed meticulously, and we have a firm grasp on the war at the front. It is imperative to ensure order in the rear, so as to stabilize society, unify our will, and strive for ultimate success. The capital is the political center of the country. As Commander-in-Chief, I bear the heavy responsibility of maintaining public order. I have now been ordered to announce temporary martial law. I earnestly hope that all citizens will respect the laws and abide by order, so that the rumors and verbal attacks of the bandits and their espionage activities will have no opportunity to succeed. All acts of gathering crowds for disturbances, looting, and arson must be strictly prohibited. All gatherings, associations, speeches, and publications must comply with martial law and accept the guidance of the government, so as not to hinder the military campaign to quell the rebellion. It must be understood that quelling the rebellion and suppressing bandits is a national war to maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, and stabilizing the rear is to support the front lines. I earnestly hope that people from all walks of life in the capital will sympathize and cooperate, jointly maintain public order, concentrate our strength, strive for victory, and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The "Amendment to Article 8 of the Martial Law Act" proposed by the Ministry of National Defense to the Executive Yuan was passed at the political affairs meeting on the 10th and decided to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. During this period of suppressing the rebellion, in various parts of the country, bandits are lurking and taking the opportunity to disrupt order, gather military intelligence, endanger national security, and affect military operations. It is difficult to achieve effective results without prompt handling according to military law. Local bandits, armed undercover bandits, etc., are especially harmful to local security. Therefore, there is a proposal to amend the original Article 8. The amended provision adds to the original provision: "In cases of traitors, bandits, and armed undercover bandits, during the period of suppressing the rebellion, even in guarded areas, military agencies may conduct trials themselves or hand them over to the courts for trial."

During the discussion on the 10th, the commissioners believed that the number of participants was too small and their power was too great, so further thorough research was needed, and no decision was made.

### Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan Propose Increasing Food Sources

To Submit Expedient Measures to the Central Government

[Report from This Newspaper] Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan were summoned by Premier Weng yesterday and will take a train to the capital tonight to attend the food conference to discuss ways to increase food sources. It is reported that Mr. Wu and Mr. Pan will submit expedient measures to the central government on how to enrich the city's food supply. As long as the central government adopts them, it will not be difficult to purchase and store one million shi of food in Shanghai within a week. As for other cities, they will not suffer from food shortages again. According to their observations, it is currently the season for new rice to enter the market and there is no shortage of grain. The reason why Beijing and Shanghai have developed into such a situation is purely due to mismanagement. Speaker Pan also told reporters to persuade citizens not to easily believe rumors and cause unnecessary panic. In particular, general stores should open for business as usual from today and should no longer try to raise prices and refuse to sell. Mr. Pan also said that Wuxi, Changshu, Songjiang, Qingpu and other areas have abandoned the rice-producing areas. It is hoped that the government and people from all walks of life will work together to quickly coordinate measures to purchase yarn, cloth, sugar, foreign and domestic groceries, cigarettes, soap, bean cake, fertilizer and other items in Shanghai and transport them to these areas to meet the needs of the people in the interior. This will naturally lead to a steady supply of food. The most important thing is that the central government must issue orders to all localities to strictly deal with all those who obstruct transportation and sales and engage in illegal activities. Only then can products from various regions be exchanged with each other, so that there will be no disease of one-sidedness. As for the poor and needy refugees who are truly hungry and cold in this city, the Municipal Relief Association has already rushed to set up porridge kitchens. We especially hope that all charitable organizations and benevolent gentlemen with a passion for public welfare will quickly raise large sums of donations or donate supplies so that they can find some comfort in their displacement. This is also a necessary step to stabilize social order.

### Feng Zhi'an's Statement

Most of the Officers and Soldiers Who Left Their Defense Have Returned to Their Units

Hope That All Circles Will Not Believe Rumors

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Bandits and spies have been spreading rumors in recent days in an attempt to disrupt morale. They have also used provocative and slanderous tactics against the National Army on the front lines. Reporters visited General Feng Zhi'an, Commander of a certain Pacification Zone, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Xuzhou, to inquire about the situation at the front. General Feng sincerely told reporters: "When the fierce battle on the Yunhe front was just beginning, I happened to be in Xuzhou. One or two weak-willed officers in my Pacification Zone actually used the false name of being ordered to advance to the front lines and led a portion of the troops away from their original defenses, moving towards the north. Fortunately, officers and soldiers at all levels discovered the abnormality midway and realized that they had been deceived, so they returned. Most of them have now returned. Only a small number of officers and soldiers, less than a regiment, were coerced by unscrupulous officers He Quan and Zhang Kexia and have not yet returned to their units. However, this does not affect the fighting. I have come to the capital specifically to report the incident to the higher authorities. I hope that all circles will not easily believe rumors and should strengthen their will to strive for a glorious victory for the Chinese nation."

### Preventing World Reddening Requires Supporting China

New York Newspaper Discusses China's Position

[Our Newspaper's New York Airmail] The New York Journal published an article on October 14th, emphasizing the extremely important position China occupies in the anti-communist war, titled "The Abandoned Ally." The newspaper concluded: "When discussing the position China occupies in American foreign policy, the subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee stated: Our actions in that country are actually helping the Communist Party and inviting the Soviet Union to take over vast areas, populations, and resources of East Asia.

At the end of the twentieth century, the world will either become Soviet or remain non-communist. In other words, 1.5 billion people can either be democratized or reddened, and in this regard, China is the decisive region.

Obviously, if our mission is to prevent the reddening of the world, then in the two most strategic regions, we must support and obtain strong allies. This is much more important than establishing 'socialism' in Western Europe."

Editorial

### Quickly Improve the Treatment of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants

The pressure of the current economic crisis is whipping everyone, especially the wounds suffered by public school teachers and civil servants, which are both heavy and painful. Therefore, the issue of improving the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants has once again become the most important topic of the moment.

The so-called "public school teachers and civil servants" generally refers to all civil and military personnel engaged in public administration and educational duties. Public school teachers and civil servants engage in public service or education in accordance with national laws and regulations, and their treatment is also subject to national laws and regulations, which is different from employees engaged in ordinary enterprises. Before the War of Resistance, due to low prices and stable living conditions, even those as impoverished as elementary school teachers could generally maintain food and clothing. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the situation has deteriorated, prices have soared, and the burden has increased. General income has obviously been unable to meet the needs of life. However, under the goal of "victory first," everyone endured hardship and worked hard, without a single complaint. After the victory of the War of Resistance, national affairs went wrong day by day, and the environment deteriorated day by day. The hardship of life for public school teachers and civil servants became a well-known tragedy. Fair public opinion always appealed for public school teachers and civil servants, demanding the adjustment of the treatment of civil and military personnel. People at home and abroad, noticing the difficult situation, all sympathized with public school teachers and civil servants. The American Bullitt also said in his "Impressions of Visiting China": "The meager treatment of Chinese civil servants has exceeded the limits of human endurance and is producing adverse results." Bullitt's observation is indeed extremely thorough.

In the past three years, although the government has made many efforts to adjust the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants, the prices, like a runaway horse, have continued to gallop forward. The treatment earned by public school teachers and civil servants in a month of hard work is still only a drop in the bucket. Before the currency reform, although life was extremely difficult, there was still hope for monthly adjustments to treatment, and the meager income could still buy some daily necessities. Unexpectedly, after the currency reform, income was frozen at the "August 19" level, but expenses continued to increase due to rising prices, and even some daily necessities could not be purchased. A buying spree occurred, and everyone held gold yuan to compete for purchases, but only public school teachers and civil servants lagged behind in the buying spree. Public school teachers and civil servants saw themselves as inferior and became objects of contempt and ridicule in the real society. The government passed the "Supplementary Measures to Improve Economic Controls" on the 31st of last month, changing price limits to negotiated prices and transforming controls into deregulation. The government also decided to make reasonable adjustments to the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants. The so-called adjustment means increasing treatment. Based on the above supplementary measures, the government adjusted and increased the prices of public utilities and transportation by a standard of four times or more, while the standard for increasing the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants was one and a half times. Now, prices in Beijing and Shanghai are like runaway trains, racing towards the most dangerous cliffs. The monthly income of general public school teachers and civil servants, especially lower-level public school teachers and civil servants, cannot buy five dou of white rice, and obtaining even a single rice dish requires careful thought and wasting endless time. This is a human tragedy, this is an unprecedented encounter for public school teachers and civil servants.

Speaking of improving treatment, it is no longer a theoretical issue, but a practical and urgent issue. In order to rationalize treatment and to understand the actual difficulties in the lives of public school teachers and civil servants, we advocate the strict implementation of the rationing system and ensure the minimum living standards of public school teachers and civil servants. During the War of Resistance, although the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants were meager, fortunately there were rations of rice, coal, oil, salt, cloth, etc. The general public was at ease and had no complaints. The effective implementation of rationing can not only stabilize the psychology of public school teachers and civil servants, but also resist high prices in the market. The more widespread the scope of rationing, the smaller the high-price market will be, and it will also help to lower prices. Today's government controls a large amount of gold, silver, and foreign exchange. It should follow the principle of "taking from the people, using for the people" and exchange a large amount of materials from overseas and from rural areas. Using the effective method of rationing, first implement rationing for public school teachers and civil servants, followed by industrial workers, occupational workers, and ordinary civilians. This is a good way to stabilize society and relieve the pain of the real lives of public school teachers and civil servants. Apart from this, there are very few reliable methods.

The lives of public school teachers and civil servants are already on the verge of death today. Their only chance of survival is closely linked to this last chance of improvement. The pressure of the current economic crisis is whipping every public school teacher and civil servant. They want to cry but have no tears, they want to shout but have no voice. Time is fleeting. It is hoped that the government will recognize the current difficulties, quickly take responsibility, and thoroughly and effectively relieve the suffering of public school teachers and civil servants, preserving some vitality for the country and cultivating some justice for the nation, not allowing it to be weakened and not allowing it to deviate. This is the most important issue in this critical moment. It is hoped that the government authorities will quickly reflect on this, catch up quickly, and although it may be late, it may not be too late!

### The President Telegraphs Three Agencies Including the Ministry of Food to Supply Rice to Beijing Citizens; All 20,000 Dan of Rice Stored in Various Warehouses to Be Taken Out for Sale

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] President Chiang is extremely concerned about the food supply situation for Beijing citizens. On the 10th, he specially telegraphed Minister Guan of the Ministry of Food, Commander-in-Chief Sun of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, and Mayor Shen of the Nanjing Municipal Government, with the original order stating: "According to the Central Daily News on the 8th, there are about 20,000 dan of grain stored in major warehouses outside Zhonghua Gate, all marked as stored by a certain agency or important person. This food rice, regardless of who it is stored by, should be quickly investigated and controlled, and universally supplied to citizens for purchase. You must comply with this and report on the handling situation." After receiving the order, the three agencies including the Ministry of Food decided after consultation that from now on, 2,000 shi of this rice will be extracted daily and distributed to 25 designated rice shops throughout the city for average distribution, supplying the entire city. It is stipulated that citizens can purchase one sheng per person per day with an ID card, with the regulated price being 4.2 yuan per sheng for cooked rice and 3.2 yuan per sheng for brown rice. Extraction began at Zhonghua Gate in the afternoon of the 10th, with the 2,000 shi of food rice needed for the first day being transported into the city and distributed to various rice shops. Comprehensive and ordinary supply will begin on the morning of the 11th.

### Spokesperson for the Ministry of Food Discusses the Grain Rationing Situation in Beijing and Shanghai

Believes Panic Buying Can Be Eliminated

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding the recent rice rush in Beijing and Shanghai, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Food recently told reporters about the grain supply situation in Beijing and Shanghai: The rationed grain for Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin and other places are all planned and allocated by the Ministry. In addition to other public and teaching grain, police grain, prisoner grain, and special project grain, the total amount supplied is about 50% of the total demand of each city. Taking Nanjing as an example, the monthly grain requirement is 260,000 shi. The Ministry of Food allocates 135,000 shi, and other allocated public and teaching grain totals over 30,000 shi. The shortage is only over 90,000 shi, about 30% of the total demand, which is not a large amount. It has always been purchased by the municipal government from producing and selling areas. The current panic buying situation is caused by nothing more than (1) farmers being willing to barter, but urban goods not going to the countryside, (2) people's hearts being unstable due to the current situation; (3) transportation being blocked in the production area. These are all temporary phenomena and will soon be eliminated.

It was previously rumored that 40,000 shi had been purchased, but this has now been found to be inaccurate. The provincial government did not approve the external transport.

### Beijing's Rice Rush Is Expected to Subside; Many People Were Killed and Injured in the Riots

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The rice rush in Beijing is expected to subside. President Chiang summoned Beijing Mayor Shen Yi on the morning of the 10th and inquired about the grain supply and the rice rush situation. He has ordered the use of the grain stockpiled outside Zhonghua Gate. It has been decided that from the 11th, all rice shops will comprehensively sell rice, and each person can purchase one sheng per day with an ID card. The rice rush was originally caused by the refusal of various rice shops to sell rice. As time passed, the common people had nothing to cook. The rice grabbers initially carried gold yuan, wanting to buy rice but unable to obtain it. They also knew very well whether the rice shops had rice or not. Therefore, after the Yufeng Rice Mill on Shigu Road was robbed at around 10 a.m. on the 9th, many people followed suit. Now that rice will be sold in various rice shops on the 11th, and civilians can purchase it, there should be no more rice grabs to vent anger.

### Details of the Riot

The Yufeng Rice Mill on Shigu Road was robbed starting at around 10 a.m. on the 9th, suffering great losses. More rice shops were robbed successively in the afternoon, reaching more than a dozen by the evening. On the night of the 9th and before dawn on the morning of the 10th, groups of civilians carrying rice bags gathered in the streets and alleys of the city, waiting for an opportunity to move. After dawn, hundreds and thousands of people gathered to search rice shops and stores for rice and grain, also affecting flour stored in candy stores and workshops, and even the neighbors of the stores storing rice and food. More than ten factory buildings of the Jinlan Biscuit Company on Baixia Road were all destroyed, with more than a thousand bags of stored flour being robbed. Some people even took the opportunity to set fires. Two men and one woman were trampled to death in the chaos, and many were injured. After the military police fired shots into the sky at 12 noon, the crowd gradually dispersed, and the fire was extinguished by the fire brigade, but the ground on Baixia Road was covered with flour. Hundreds of bags of sugar stored by the company and the families' valuables were also emptied, with losses reaching 20 million gold yuan. Also, at around 9 a.m., rice hidden in the basement of the Keyongtai Rice Shop on Taiping Road was also robbed. Two boys participating in the rice grab were trampled to death, and one was crushed to death by a shelf. A shop assistant from the Tongfeng Rice Mill on Baixia Road was stabbed in the buttocks. The Guanshengyuan workshop in Beiting Lane was also robbed. The lines that were originally waiting to buy rice were also in great disorder. The military police were helpless. Such incidents occurred in all five districts of the city: east, south, west, north, and central. Only Xiaguan District was able to maintain safety because each rice shop has consistently continued to retail to the market and has never refused buyers or hoarded for speculation. The rice rush in recent days proves that the rice shortage in Beijing is entirely caused by human factors. The general public and the military police maintaining order also expressed sympathy for the rice grabbers. Many rice grabbers were arrested, transferred by the police station to the Capital District Court. The District Court is speeding up the processing of prisoner releases due to the difficulty of providing prisoner food. Now, there is a sudden increase in the number of prisoners arrested for rice grabbing, and they must also be provided with food during their detention period, which is inevitable.

### Expanding the Power of the Investigation Committee to Curb Balkan Turmoil

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The UN Political Committee this morning passed the Greek issue proposal of the four countries, China, the United States, Britain, and France, by a majority of 48 votes against the Slavic bloc's 6 votes.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] Palestine Acting Mediator Bunche submitted a proposal to the Security Council today, requesting that negotiations be initiated by the United Nations mediator to establish a truce treaty between Arabs and Jews. Bunche also suggested: (1) Expanding demilitarized zones; (2) Both sides' troops withdraw from their current positions; (3) Reducing all troops on both sides. Bunche pointed out that this plan is the first step in restoring peace to the Holy Land. U.S. representative Jessup agreed to consider it and consult with his government regarding the suggestion.

[Associated Press, Paris, 10th] The Security Council continued its closed session today to discuss Bunche's proposal. France has expressed its support. Soviet representative Malik proposed an amendment, advocating that the Security Council order the Arab and Jewish sides to negotiate peace directly. The Security Council decided to postpone the next discussion to an unspecified date.

[United Press, Paris, 10th] An Israeli spokesperson, commenting on the Bunche plan, emphasized that this plan would "consolidate Arab aggression in Palestine. We frankly oppose any plan that calls for demilitarized zones or no-man's-lands." It is heard that Soviet representative Malik is prepared to work for Israel in the Security Council and oppose this new plan.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 10th] Israeli President Weizmann sent an urgent telegram to President Truman on the 10th, strongly stating that direct negotiations between Arabs and Jews are extremely necessary. Weizmann said that these negotiations should be based on "accelerating the withdrawal of aggressive troops, fully recognizing the State of Israel, and allowing the State of Israel to join the United Nations." He urged Truman to pay attention to the measures "attempting to exclude the main territory of the Negev Desert from Israel." He said: He believes that Truman's intervention will be beneficial in reaffirming American policy and the proposals that will be presented in the UN General Assembly Political Committee in the future.

Estimated to Exceed $200 Million

[United Press, New York, 10th] U.S. Army Under Secretary Draper told United Press reporters in a personal interview on the 10th that Japan can expect to receive more than 50 percent more reconstruction funds from the Democratic New Congress than in 1948. Draper, who is in charge of occupation area affairs, estimated the allocation to be between $150 million and $200 million, not including special funds for preventing disease and unrest.

It is said that there is no sign of an immediate peace treaty with Japan, and the current global unrest prevents the United States from signing a separate peace treaty with Japan.

### Rice Prices Fall, Mayor Relieved, Expresses Optimism About Food Prospects; Rice Hoarding Affects Market Transactions; Military and Police Increased Protection Starting Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] Rice prices in the city have begun to fall yesterday, and the rice hoarding trend has also subsided slightly. Mayor Wu was quite pleased yesterday as the rice price decline is the first occurrence since the opening of price limits. When meeting with reporters at the city government office at 6:00 PM yesterday, he said: Commander Xuan of the Garrison Command issued a public notice last night that anyone caught hoarding rice will be severely punished. I advocate court martial. Because open trade in rice is not smooth, rice hoarding is a major reason, because rice merchants are afraid that the protection in the market is not adequate, and they dare not trade openly. After increasing the military and police protection starting yesterday, the rice price fell from 750 yuan per dan (unit of weight) to 550 yuan, but still no one buys it. He deeply believes that rice prices will continue to fall today, because the amount of foreign rice ordered by the city government is considerable. Once it is shipped to Shanghai successively, rice prices will definitely be suppressed. He finally said: "In my personal view, this phenomenon of urban-rural disconnection and the gap between raw materials and products can pass in a week. What will happen in the future depends on the economic policies of the new cabinet."

Although Premier Weng telegraphed to stop it, it has not yet been shipped to Shanghai. For example, the city had ordered more than 10,000 dan of rice from Hangzhou, which was exchanged for fertilizer, but it was also prevented from being transported. This was discussed for a long time at yesterday's grain meeting, and it was decided to continue negotiations with various places and send armed personnel to protect and rush the shipment to Shanghai.

According to Director Yang: The October household rice distribution in the city will end no later than the 20th of this month and will not be extended again, and it is guaranteed that those holding purchase certificates can purchase rice or flour.

### Director Yu Issues Statement Hoping Citizens Will Not Believe Rumors; Evil Bandits Disrupting Public Morale Are Being Closely Investigated

Yu Shuping, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, issued a statement yesterday regarding the recent rice-grabbing incidents in the city, stating: "The main reason for the rice-grabbing incidents that have occurred in recent days is the unsoundness of the citizens' psychology. The factor that constitutes this unsound psychology is the dissemination of rumors by a small number of evil bandits and unscrupulous individuals to incite the public. Those who originally had one dou of rice at home try to get two dou, and those who originally had one shi try to get two shi, thus creating a rice-grabbing frenzy. Take the recent widespread rumor that the city's water and electricity supply would be cut off, causing citizens to rush to store water for backup, as an example. This was also caused by evil bandits spreading rumors to disrupt public morale. It is rumored that there are a few evil bandits and hidden elements in the city who are disguised as water and electricity repairmen. Under the pretext of repairing water and electricity, they go to various households to damage water and electricity equipment and claim that the water and electricity supply will be cut off to disrupt public morale. The police bureau is currently paying close attention to the investigation and is earnestly hoping that citizens will provide secret reports to ensure the arrest of these villains who spread rumors and damage residents' water and electricity equipment. Regarding the rice supply issue, the Municipal Government is making every effort to facilitate the supply, and tens of thousands of shi will arrive in Shanghai within a week. Therefore, the supply can be restored to a normal state. As for other scarce materials such as gauze and cloth, the government is starting to sell them off. The sharp drop in gauze and cloth prices in the past two days is due to this reason."

Request Police Protection for Purchasing and Transporting Grain to Shanghai

"The grabbing and snatching that occurred during the distribution of rice is mostly due to issues related to order management and sales techniques. I have ordered all subordinate precincts to send police to strictly maintain the order of the queues, simplify the procedures for measuring rice, and strive to avoid chaotic situations. Furthermore, the security of various agencies and rice merchants purchasing and transporting grain to Shanghai can be requested from the police bureau, so as to minimize the chances of causing unrest and robbery. As for the recent incidents of a small number of refugees taking the opportunity to rob residents' property, this is not what refugees should do. It is the behavior of bandits who take advantage of the situation to cause trouble. In order to maintain the city's security, if such incidents occur again, the perpetrators will be dealt with by military law once they are arrested, without leniency."

Strengthening the Equipment of Police Officers to Cope with Extraordinary Situations

Yu also said: "In order to relieve the hunger of refugees, in addition to the government finding ways, I also hope that wealthy residents will generously provide porridge for relief." Yu finally mentioned the security situation in Taizhou, saying: "The police bureau is currently strengthening the equipment of all police officers so that they can cope with extraordinary situations and shoulder extraordinary missions. In consideration of the livelihood of police officers due to rising prices, the police bureau has released two and a half months' salary in advance for each person, and food has also been prepared to be sufficient. All police officers can work with peace of mind."

The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued the following proclamation on the 10th to strictly prohibit the grabbing of grain: "It has been found that the allocation of rice to households in this city has been purchased from production areas by the grain administration authorities and the municipal authorities and can be supplied continuously. Even if there is a slight delay, it will not cut off the people's food supply. However, some unscrupulous individuals are taking the opportunity to make trouble, inciting the ignorant, and wantonly grabbing and plundering, which not only disrupts order but also hinders the suppression of the rebellion. This headquarters is responsible for security and will not allow this trend to grow. It has been ordered to strictly arrest and deal with them. Those who hoard grain and refuse to sell it will also be severely punished once they are discovered. At this critical time, stability is the top priority. I hope that all good citizens will uphold this intention, assist the government, and jointly maintain the difficult situation."

### Tongji's Four Hundred Freshmen: Unable to Resolve Food Issue; Requesting a General Leave from the School

[Reported by this newspaper] The 408 students in the freshman院 of Tongji University have been eating thin porridge and salty yellow beans for the past three days due to the lack of rice. Yesterday, they requested a general leave from the school. Xia Jianbai, Dean of Academic Affairs of the school, claimed that the rice stored by the school can only last until tomorrow (the 12th) at most. The November rice ration issued by the Civil Affairs Commission has not yet been received, and he will go to urge and negotiate it today. In addition to rice, fuel is also a major problem. The school burns 40 dan of firewood every day, and the current market price is around 200 yuan per dan. Fuel alone costs 8,000 yuan per day. The school's remaining funds are only several thousand yuan. They had previously telegraphed the Ministry of Education for instructions, but there has been no news. The school is now like a hotel and restaurant, and the school officials are extremely busy with the meals for thousands of people. The November salary of the faculty and staff has been increased by one and a half times according to central regulations, but the school has not yet been able to pay it in full due to financial constraints. The school has decided to hold an administrative meeting today to discuss how to maintain food supplies after two days.

### Jiaotong University Professors Milling Rice; Students Initiate

[Reported by this newspaper] Students at Jiaotong University recently discovered that four or five professors from the school were also lined up in long queues, with numbers written on their backs, milling rice. Students from various departments, witnessing this situation, were deeply moved. In addition to inquiring about the professors' living difficulties, they initiated a campaign to have students queue up to buy rice on behalf of the professors. Wang Zhizhuo, President of Jiaotong University, went to the capital yesterday evening to request instructions from the Ministry of Education on issues such as student meals, professor salaries, and the school's financial difficulties.

### Great China University Advance Holiday; President's Statement Is Inaccurate

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, it was rumored that Great China University would hold exams and start the holiday early due to food shortages. President Ou Yuanhuai told reporters that the school's stored rice could originally last until the 20th of this month. Now, the Civil Affairs Commission has allocated the November ration in advance, which can last until the beginning of next month at least. Other supplies such as oil and firewood are also not a problem. The midterm exams to be held next week were decided earlier, and classes will continue as usual after the exams. The rumor that the holiday would be brought forward is purely a rumor.

### Using Foreign Exchange to Import Raw Materials; Export Control Committee Sets Review Criteria; Application Acceptance to Begin Today

Although the Central Bank's foreign exchange payment measures have been announced, they cannot be accepted by applicants because the implementing rules have not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan. In order to ensure a steady flow of foreign raw materials, equipment, and energy to meet domestic needs, the Export Control Committee specially drafted a "Review Criteria for Using Central Bank Foreign Exchange for Import" before the Executive Yuan announced the implementing rules. This standard has been approved in principle by Huo Baoshu, chairman of the committee, and it has been stipulated that applications will be accepted starting today. All review details will be implemented in accordance with this standard. After applying, applicants will first undergo a preliminary review by the Overseas Chinese Investment in Domestic Production Enterprises and the Central Bank Foreign Exchange Payment Import Review Committee, depending on the type of materials they wish to import. Then, it will be sent to the Quota Allocation Department of the Export Control Committee for review. Once approved, it will be imported. However, the payment amount must still be handled in accordance with the regulations. One-half of the production equipment can be paid, one-quarter of the industrial raw materials can be paid, and only one-quarter of other items can be paid.

### Yarn Prices Continue to Fall, Fabric Market Suffers Further Decline

Yesterday, the yarn market experienced sluggish trading due to tight positions among dealers. The quoted price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 8,500 yuan, a further decline of 1,000 yuan from the previous day. 21-count Double Horse yarn also plummeted to 5,200 yuan, a drop of 600 yuan. Other yarns, both coarse and fine, continued to decline by about half a percentage point.

Textile Construction Company Yarn Sales

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company held its routine quotation and sale of cotton yarn, offering five types in total. The types and prices are as follows: 20-count Tianguan 5,000 yuan, 8-count Riguang 3,000 yuan, 10-count Lima 3,300 yuan, 40-count Riguang and Hongbao Guang both 7,000 yuan. The 20-count Tianguan was sold on behalf of the Central Bank.

Yesterday's sales were conducted as follows: underwear businesses were limited to either 8-count Riguang or 40-count Riguang, towel businesses were limited to 20-count Tianguan, canvas businesses were limited to either 10-count Lima or 20-count Tianguan, handkerchief businesses were limited to 40-count Hongshi Guang, and glove, hand-weaving businesses and the local guild were limited to selecting one type. As a result, 14 purchase permits were approved, selling a total of 28 pieces, equivalent to 53.5 pieces of 20-count yarn, totaling 174,000 yuan. Purchase requests must be filled in with a self-declared (tax-inclusive quotation). If the quotation is lower than the approved price, the original request will be returned. It is also reported that the allocation method is 70% in exchange for finished products and 30% in cash.

Fabric Prices Decline

The cotton fabric market declined because brokerage firms stopped lending. The market's credit situation worsened, and many brokerage firms had returned checks. Those with goods on hand frequently resorted to slashing prices. Financial institutions and fabric businesses also engaged in selling, creating a strong selling atmosphere. Quoted prices declined sharply. It is also reported that some stores had already voluntarily opened for trading, but the purchasing power of citizens was much lower than before. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth dropped from 280 yuan to 220 yuan, but recovered to 240 yuan due to short covering. The closing price was 40 yuan lower than the previous day. Around 12 o'clock after closing, customer groups made further purchases, resulting in an additional increase of 10 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji (a type of fabric) saw sluggish sales in the northern markets and recovered slightly to 255 yuan with some transactions, a drop of 20 to 30 yuan. 190 high-end Shilin (a type of fabric) was quoted as low as 500 yuan, with a few transactions.

Cotton Market Continues to Weaken

The Joint Cotton Purchasing Association has started purchasing. Businesses are experiencing credit constraints and have a strong desire to sell. Over 2,000 dan of Jingyang Han fine yarn, Shashi Huoji and other cotton were traded. Zhoupu seed cotton was quoted at 330 yuan in the morning and 280 yuan in the afternoon, but no one bought it. The market situation is also weak.

### Woolen Fabric Trading Resumes, Prices Rise More Than Twelvefold

Woolen fabric trading, which had been suspended for a long time, resumed yesterday morning because factories had allocated goods. The prices of goods were uniformly increased by 12 to 17 times. The factory prices have been agreed upon by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Woolen Fabric Industry Association, ranging from 275 to 335 gold yuan per yard. The largest price increase among various goods was for striped flannel, and the smallest was for flannel, etc.

Retail prices are 385 yuan per yard for striped flannel, 77 yuan per foot, an increase of about 17 times compared to before the price limit was lifted. Flannel sells for 175 gold yuan per yard, 35 yuan per foot, an increase of 12 to 13 times compared to before. However, the factories have not shipped many goods, so there is no trading in the market. Based on the current price of woolen fabric, the cost of raw materials for each suit is more than 1,150 gold yuan. There are many difficulties in the woolen fabric stores, and few people come to purchase.

[Our Dispatch] The Textile Construction Company's woolen fabrics are scheduled to go on temporary sale today (the 11th), but only for retail. Wholesale will not be supplied for the time being.

### Credit Extremely Tight, Daily Interest Reaches 170 Yuan

Yesterday, credit became even tighter, with the overnight interest rate soaring to 150 to 170 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 4.5 to 5 yuan, setting an unprecedented high. This led to many bounced checks in the market, and some small businesses struggled to cope.

### Rice Prices Slightly Stabilize, Flour Trading Active, Coarse Grains Decline

Due to extreme shortages, rice prices remain high, but the upward trend has been contained and prices have slightly stabilized. The market registered 65 shi of goods arriving in the southern market and 156 shi in the northern market, but no trading took place. The off-market black market price for white japonica rice is still 700 yuan, unpolished japonica rice is 600 yuan, and white Duxian rice is 650 yuan.

Flour

Trading in the market was active yesterday. Due to the extremely tight credit, sellers were eager to sell, and prices fell sharply by another 20%. Bingchuan flour fell below 200 yuan to 190 yuan, and Maigen flour was 180 yuan. Bran also fell sharply again, with large bags dropping to 115 yuan.

Coarse Grains

With credit tightening, sellers were eager to sell a lot. Soybeans continued to decline by 20%, with Xuzhou soybeans falling below 200 yuan. Corn and red sorghum both fell by another 20 to 30 yuan. There were still many sesame transactions, and prices also fell by another 30 to 40 yuan. Although raw peanuts have a way to be sold in this street, prices are also 40 to 50 yuan lower.

Cooking Oil

Because the actual sales in this street are active, cooking oil is very popular, and prices are very firm. Soybean oil has even rebounded. The initial price of soybean oil from various factories was 1,000 yuan, then about 980 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan. Rapeseed oil and raw oil are stable, with Jisheng oil trading at 1,400 yuan. Soybean cake rebounded, with Yuji cake at 70 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan.

### Sale of China Textile Construction Company, Possible Increase in Percentage

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the Nanjing Political Affairs Conference resolved to sell the entire China Textile Construction Company. This reporter specifically inquired about the details from relevant parties. It was revealed that the originally planned regulations for the sale may be appropriately increased. During the sale, each factory and its related institutions will be formed into separate sales units to avoid production interruptions after the sale. The method of issuing stocks will still be adopted during the sale. It is believed that after the decision on the sale of branch factories is made, it will stimulate investors' interest and be conducive to the promotion of stocks.

### Rayon Resumes Allocation

The Central Trust Bureau decided at a meeting yesterday morning that rayon allocation, which had been suspended for two weeks, would resume from yesterday. The rayon allocated this week is still the 89th installment, all Italian-produced rayon. The allocation amount is 3% of the needs of the silk weaving industry, and the allocation price has increased to 11,290 yuan per case. Not many silk weaving businesses accepted the allocation yesterday.

### State-Owned Enterprise Stocks Ordered to be Temporarily Suspended from Sale

As of the 6th of this month, Central Banks and their entrusted sales agencies in various locations have sold a total of 10,038,720 yuan worth of state-owned enterprise stocks. Taiwan Sugar and China Textile Construction Company have sold more, followed by Tianjin Paper. Taiwan Sugar sold 6,236,900 yuan, China Textile Construction Company sold 3,700,950 yuan, Taiwan Paper sold 392,800 yuan, China Merchants Bureau sold 54,000 yuan, and Tianjin Paper sold 4,000 yuan.

### Involving Grassroots Politics: Guizhou Province Adjusts Counties and Institutions

— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Our Dispatch from Guiyang, 7th] Guizhou Province Chairman Gu Zhenglun successively toured Qianxi, northwestern Guizhou, and southern Guizhou in August, September, and October, covering approximately 25 counties. After conducting on-the-spot inspections of local administration, he recognized that county-level institutions were large, with numerous personnel, while compensation was excessively meager and there were no operating funds. This was a serious problem in current grassroots politics. He instructed relevant provincial agencies to earnestly study the "County-Level Institution Adjustment Plan" to serve as the foundation for future improvements in grassroots politics. After several discussions, it was approved at a recent provincial government regular meeting. Gu also reported on its content and implementation objectives at the November monthly meeting of provincial agencies held on the 2nd.

According to Gu's report, this "County-Level Institution Adjustment Plan" consists of approximately thirty items. We can summarize them into three categories: (1) streamlining organization, (2) adjusting powers, and (3) improving compensation.

Streamlining Organization

In terms of streamlining organization, county governments will be classified into three classes and seven grades based on the population and wealth of each county. First-class counties will have five departments and two offices, while second and third-class counties will have four departments and two offices. The personnel staffing for a first-class Grade A county will be 60 people (according to the province, only Zunyi County is a first-class Grade A county), first-class Grade B counties will have 50 people, first-class Grade C counties will have 47 people, second-class Grade A counties will have 45 people, second-class Grade B counties will have 42 people, third-class Grade A counties will have 38 people, and third-class Grade B counties will have 36 people. County-affiliated institutions will be adjusted in three parts: some will be retained due to the importance of their functions, but the number of personnel will be reduced as much as possible, such as the People's Self-Defense Corps, health clinics, independently established county treasuries, township offices, etc. Some will retain their names, but staff will be laid off, and their functions will be handled concurrently by relevant units, such as people's education halls, libraries, gymnasiums, agricultural extension centers, military service associations, New Life Movement associations, Boy Scout branches, etc. Some institutions will be selectively retained, the number of personnel will be reduced as much as possible, and the rest will be abolished, such as provincial police stations, which will only retain important transportation strongholds along the highways in 24 counties, establishing first, second, and third-class police stations. Another 12 counties will establish first, second, and third-class police posts, and the rest will be abolished. Provincial tax collection offices will only retain important transportation and commercial hubs along the highways in 8 counties, but the number of personnel must be reduced, and the rest will be abolished. Provincial relief agencies will only retain 24 counties in poor border areas where relief is essential, the number of personnel will also be reduced, and the rest will be abolished.

School Adjustments

In addition, county-level middle schools will primarily operate junior high schools, and the number of personnel will also be reduced. National education will be adjusted according to the standard of establishing one central national school in each township and one national school in every five bao. Surplus schools, if they have good performance and sufficient funding, may be selectively retained after being specifically approved, otherwise, they will be uniformly merged or abolished.

According to Gu, after such adjustments in the counties throughout the province, based on the current actual situation of each county, human and financial resources can be rationally and appropriately concentrated, greatly improving work efficiency while avoiding wasteful spending and dispersed efforts, which will greatly change local administration.

Dividing Powers

In terms of adjusting powers, the plan stipulates that the five departments and two offices established by the county government will be as follows: the First Department will be responsible for household registration, baojia (community security), local autonomy, opium prohibition, etiquette, society, health, religion, grain storage, and other matters. The Second Department will be responsible for county local rent and interest, public funds and property, tax collection, land administration, and other financial administration matters. The Third Department will be responsible for county secondary education, national education, social education, and other education and cultural matters. The Fourth Department will be responsible for county agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, mining, transportation, engineering, industry and commerce, general administration, cooperative enterprises, and public utilities. The Fifth Department will be responsible for county conscription, preferential treatment for the families of soldiers on duty, military pensions, the management of soldiers in their hometowns, and the compilation of the militia registry. The Secretariat will be responsible for confidential matters, mobilization, personnel, statistics, auditing, planning, safekeeping of seals, receiving and sending documents, storing documents, handling cashiering and general affairs, and other matters not belonging to the departments and offices. The Accounting Office will be responsible for county and county government accounting and financial matters. In counties without a Fifth Department, military service matters will be handled by the First Department. In counties without a police station, police matters will be handled by a police adjutant. As for affiliated institutions, except for the abolished parts that are merged with relevant units to be handled concurrently, the rest will continue to be handled as before.

Connecting Vertically and Horizontally

Gu believes that the reason why county-level institution adjustments in the past failed to achieve practical results is that those who drafted the plans mostly failed to fully understand the various problems of local administration. He said that this time he personally visited twenty-five or six counties, from western Guizhou and northwestern Guizhou to southern Guizhou, personally witnessed and heard firsthand, and then had practical administrative experienced people from both the province and county level earnestly study it before making this decision. He believes that the county-level institutions can connect vertically and horizontally, operate freely, and achieve the practical effects of division of labor and cooperation.

### Jiangsu Province Rice Shortage to be Resolved: Zhenjiang Loans to Purchase and Distribute Grain

[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 9th] The food panic in Jiangsu Province will return to normal in the short term. It is learned that the citizens are now preparing to request the Materials Adjustment Office Inspection Committee to officially announce the inspection results and to formally publish the names of each factory and store, the amount stored, and the names of all owners to see what the conscience of good merchants is really like.

Local responsible authorities, in order to solve the grain shortage and relieve grain merchants, have negotiated with the local Five Nations Bank for a loan of 2 million yuan to purchase grain and have already purchased grain from Hexia, which is scheduled to be distributed in twelve groups starting on the 10th, with each person limited to one liter per day (no grain purchase certificate required).

Also, dispatch: Tian Liang, Director of the Grain Department, went to Beijing on the morning of the 9th, representing the grain industry in Jiangnan Zhen, Xi, and Chang, to negotiate with the Grain Ministry for the purchase of rice and paddy in Wuhu Sanhe to relieve the grain shortage in Jiangnan. It is reported that Zhenjiang grain merchants have purchased 50,000 shi of rice and paddy in Wuhu, but they have not been able to transport it immediately due to the Anhui Province outbound ban. Tian's visit to Beijing this time will likely request the Grain Ministry to resolve the issue.

### The Story of Macaroni

— Fangcao

I can't buy rice, and I can't squeeze in to buy noodles, so today I fried macaroni with some shredded vegetables and meat to eat, and the flavor is not bad. Anyway, eating one meal is like dealing with one meal. There are traces of insect damage on the macaroni. I thought of the dates with "more than half eaten by maggots," which some people also eat. Mom just put up with it. So I thought about how "not easy to come by" this plate of macaroni was, and I really thought of it as a delicacy.

Suddenly I remembered a story about macaroni that I saw a few days ago. Although it is old news now, it was considered behind-the-scenes news back then. So I translated it to fill this talk.

After the January 28th Shanghai Incident came to an end, when ceasefire negotiations were held, the main hope of the Japanese side was to划出 (designate)a huge demilitarized zone as another base for extending its power to the mainland. At that time, the United Kingdom and the United States opposed this because their businesses would be harmed. After many days of consultation, a conclusion could not be drawn. The Japanese representatives also had a premonition that their efforts would be in vain. In order to save face, they specially gave long and stinky speeches at the meeting. The foreign representatives who participated in the consultations were extremely anxious and everyone found it annoying.

At that time, Dinah, who died in Shanghai the year before last, was assisting the Chinese delegation, but he sat behind British Minister Sir Lampson (now Lord Killearn) at the meeting. One day, everyone was really unwilling to listen to the Japanese speech anymore, so Dinah wanted to find a way to entertain himself. He patted Lampson on the shoulder and said softly, "Where did the hole in the center of the macaroni come from?"

Lampson stared at him blankly and gave a knowing smile. He said, "I don't know. How did it come about?"

Dinah said, "I don't understand its mystery either."

Their conversation aroused the interest of other European and American envoys. Everyone stopped paying attention to the Japanese and started studying the macaroni problem. American Minister Johnson had a flash of inspiration and said, "Macaroni is produced in Italy, and Ciano must know." Lampson gladly wrote a note and threw it to Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, who was sitting opposite him. Ciano was then the Italian Minister to China.

Ciano read the note and laughed, writing "I don't understand either." and threw it back.

In a short while, the note was passed back and forth among many diplomatic envoys, making the Japanese representatives uneasy, not knowing what conspiracy the countries had. The Japanese representative who was speaking saw the note flying over and couldn't help but pause, forgetting what to say, stammering and extremely flustered. At that time, Ciano whispered that he had sent a secretary to the consulate, thinking that someone there would always know how the hole in the middle of the macaroni came about. For a while, everyone speculated, but the Japanese representatives were baffled - this mystery is probably still unsolved to this day. Suddenly, Lampson stood up again, tiptoed out, and came back with a mysterious thick book - the Encyclopedia Britannica. He quickly flipped to the "Macaroni" section, read it carefully, and whispered to Johnson, who whispered to the person next to him. In a short while, everyone except the Japanese knew that although the content of the Encyclopedia Britannica was rich, it uniquely lacked a passage on how macaroni has a hole in the middle.

Finally, Ciano's secretary, sweating profusely, walked in quickly and quietly gave Ciano a report. Ciano coughed, cleared his throat, put on the air of a university professor lecturing, and said loudly: "Gentlemen, it is made with a machine"

His voice was heard by the Japanese. But they didn't understand, and seeing everyone laughing together, they were just puzzled - this mystery is probably still unsolved by them to this day.

### I Also Talk About Dreams

— Old Man Banmeng (Half-Dream)

On the 5th of this month, the Free Talk in this newspaper published an article by Fei Yu on dreams, saying that the reasons for dreams are nothing more than two types: "Think during the day, dream at night," and "Be aware at night, then dream," and listed facts to prove it, which is very insightful. But there are also those that are not entirely true. In the past, Bai Juyi and his younger brother Xingjian were游 (roaming around)the Ci'en Temple in Qujiang, and suddenly remembered that Yuan Weizhi was sent to Liangzhou as an envoy, and estimated that he could arrive today, and题壁 (inscribed a poem on the wall): "In spring, there is no way to break the spring sorrow, drunk folding flower branches as wine chips, suddenly remembering an old friend leaving for the horizon, estimating that he will arrive in Liangzhou today." The next day, Weizhi sent an envoy to bring a letter, with an attached poem: "I dreamed of you brothers in Qujiang, also 遊 (roaming around)in the Ci'en Temple, the subordinate officials called people to arrange horses to leave, and I woke up to find myself in ancient Liangzhou." It can be said that the day Bai wrote the poem on the wall was the time when Weizhi dreamed in Liangzhou, which can be said to be incredibly coincidental. On one hand, Bai Fu had the idea to write a poem, and on the other hand, Weizhi dreamed. Dream and thought are both the same thing, which is also a strange thing.

My friend, Mr. Someone, has served as a magistrate in busy places. At the age of forty, he gave up his intention to pursue officialdom. One night, he dreamed of passing by the provincial government and saw a notice掛牌 (hanging a sign)appointing him to a certain county vacancy, but the name of the county was slightly blurred. After returning to his residence, he saw guests coming to congratulate him. Mr. Someone said that he did not intend to be a Feng Fu (a famous charioteer who gave up driving but later resumed it), and although he was appointed, he was unwilling to go. The guests persuaded him, saying that his family was poor and his parents were old, and it was not yet time to retire. This county had simple administration and a fair legal system, beautiful mountains and rivers, and he had served there for eight years, knew it extremely well, and hoped he would not refuse firmly. Mr. Someone visited the 大府 (governor), but his resignation was not approved, so he went to take office. On the day of departure, he took a wooden boat by waterway, then changed to a steamer, passed a place, changed to a wooden boat again, and after landing, he changed to sedan chairs. He traveled for six days to reach his post. Mr. Someone suddenly woke up from his dream, and the rooster crowed for the first time. The dream was vivid in his mind, so he told his wife and said that he was determined to get rid of officialdom, but he had a dream just now, and he was afraid it was not inevitable, so he told her what he dreamed. After several months, he was actually appointed to a certain county vacancy, and the words of persuasion from the congratulatory guests, as well as the situation of the journey to take office, were all in line. Mr. Someone had not considered this matter several months ago, but suddenly dreamed about it, and several months later, he suddenly saw the facts that he had experienced in the dream, which cannot but be called a miracle.

From this, we can know that dreams do not necessarily have to have thoughts, and extremely complex thoughts do not necessarily enter dreams. Most of them are just accidental coincidences. If we can think during the day and enter dreams at night, and have a certain grasp of it, we would rather live in dreams for a lifetime and have good dreams, and not have to toil in the world again. I have often seen strange and magnificent works in my dreams many times. After waking up, I often want to enter my dreams again to watch them again, but often I cannot get them. Then, after thinking about it, what is the benefit of watching them again! For example, those who occupy high positions and wield great power are only glorious for a while, and over time, they taste like chewing wax. It is better to change to another realm, which is more interesting. This is why Lu Sheng on the road of Handan, after waking up, followed the immortal Lu into the mountains.

### Maintaining Reason

— Mao Yi

Imagine you are staying in a room on the tenth-something floor of a hotel, and the hotel unfortunately catches fire, the flames already licking at your room. The hallway outside your room has become a sea of fire - there is no hope of escaping via the emergency staircase. In this case, do you still have a chance to escape danger? Yes, as long as you can maintain your reason.

Once, a fire broke out at the Winecoff Hotel in Atlanta, USA. An officer and his wife found themselves in such a fiery pit. Other travelers, in a state of panic, desperately jumped out of the building one after another. The officer's wife also panicked and wanted to jump. He grabbed her arm and threatened to slap her. "We have a chance to escape," he said, "if you do exactly as I say."

First, they turned on all the taps in the washbasin and bathtub. Then, he pulled the blankets off the bed, soaked them in the bathtub, and bravely opened the door leading to the smoke-filled hall, hanging the wet blankets outside the door to prevent the door from catching fire immediately.

The two of them then worked together to lift the mattress from the double bed and placed it flat against the door. They moved the dressing table to prop up the mattress, but the top of the mattress still drooped outward and could not be pressed tightly against the door, so they took a chair, placed it on the dressing table, and completely propped up the mattress. The officer took a leak-proof wastepaper basket, his wife took a bottle, and they both fetched water from the bathroom to soak the mattress thoroughly.

Eventually, the floor of the bedroom was covered in two inches of water, and the taps continued to run. The room was filled with smoke. Then, the officer opened the top and bottom of the window a little - the gap was small enough to prevent flames from entering, but allowed air to circulate. Then, the two of them draped the soaked carpets over their heads like a tent, trying as much as possible to prevent the suffocating smoke. They sat by the window, their nostrils positioned near the lower opening of the window.

Four hours later, firefighters broke down the door and entered, and they were still sitting unharmed by the window.

### Miscellaneous Poems on Recent Events in Suzhou (Part 1)

— Shou Juan

A bountiful year yet no granary stores are seen,
Each grain becomes a delicacy at the feast;
Picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence brings no relief from hunger,
Yuanming now becomes a waist-bending man.

The economic world suddenly rises a storm, rice and grains disappear from the market. I, foolishly, usually have no savings, and am in danger of Chen. Fortunately, I received rock rice from my friends Zhang Keyu and Zhu Senyuan, and personally went to the rice mill outside Panmen to bring it back in two batches, so my family was spared from an empty stomach. I am grateful and tears welling. This autumn, I was learning from Tao Yuanming, picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, and now I have no choice but to bow down for five dou of rice.

Rice is like pearls, firewood like cassia,
Filling the belly against my long wish;
Admirable the skill of the strong men,
Blocking roads and stopping cars, they return in triumph.

Some people buy and transport firewood and rice into the city from the countryside, but on the way they are intercepted by strong men and taken away, so even wanting to fill the belly is unattainable.

The price limit comes from the 19th of August,
Skimping on labor and materials, much scheming;
Pitiable the large pancake, like myself, thin,
Almost wanting to fly away in the wind.

Although the large pancake reluctantly follows the price limit of the 19th of August, it is still sold for two fen in gold yuan, but the reduction in materials and skimping on labor become more and more severe, and it shrinks more and more, almost wanting to fly away in the wind.

Throwing away gold coins without realizing it,
The meal only has vegetables on the table;
Not knowing the taste of meat for three months,
This commoner is surprisingly like a sage.

Price-controlled pork is nowhere to be found, only vegetables are used to accompany meals, and even three meals a day cannot be managed without gold coins.

One night, a fierce wind rises from the ground,
The shops and markets of the six streets all empty;
The scholar lightly believes in the goodness of the gold yuan,
No way to send away poverty, only making it worse.

Once the rush to buy starts, nine out of ten shops in the market are empty. I, foolishly believing in the value of the gold yuan, did not rush to buy anything at first, and eventually lacked both clothing and food, regretting it too late!
