[Our Correspondent in Gu Ling, 11th] This morning, the President, for the first time, went for a solitary outing in Gu Ling.

At 9:15 AM, the President walked out of the official residence, accompanied by more than ten attendants. He walked along Hedong Road, Zheng Street, Xijie Street and Xuan Yuan Road before climbing Olive Mountain. Few people knew about this at the time. When passers-by saw the President, they bowed in respect. The President took off his hat and nodded in return, a happy smile on his face. The President wore a dark grayish-blue silk long gown, green socks, cloth shoes, and a gray cork hat, looking very elegant as he walked down the street. The stone steps on Olive Mountain were quite steep.

Upon hearing the news, Gan Province Chairman Hu Jiafeng and Administration Director Wang Zuomin rushed to the scene, accompanying the President after climbing the mountain. The President then went to Songguang Ridge, looking out for about ten minutes before descending the mountain.

The President appeared relaxed as he descended the mountain, still not riding in a vehicle. There were the most people gathered in front of the Hu Jinfang Inn. As the President passed by, the people bowed and applauded. Hu Jinfang, with his white beard and hair, took the lead in shouting, "Long live President Chiang!" The President returned the greeting with a smile. On Xijie Street, he saw a tap that had not been turned off and told his attendants to turn off the tap to conserve resources. Along the way, the people bowed frequently, and the President took off his hat to return the greeting. He finally returned to the official residence at 10:35 AM.

### US Authorities Predict; If the Republican Party Takes Office Next Year; Military Aid to China Will Be Strengthened; US Army Chief Expresses Optimism About China's Military

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] Authorities predicted on the 10th that China will fully utilize 125 million US dollars of US military aid by January next year. If the Republican Party is in power by then, China will make new requests for increased aid to combat the communists. They also believe that if the Republican Party is in power, it is highly likely that it will allocate more aid funds to China than the Democratic government. If so, the new plan will follow the plan to aid Turkey and Greece, sending "instructors" to guide the army on the battlefield, which is promising. Observers believe that although there are now signs that the Truman administration has accelerated aid to China after some delay, for practical purposes, China must choose one of two policies. One is full aid to the Chinese National Government, a policy favored by Congress under the leadership of Senator Bridges and Representative Eder. The other is the Truman administration's policy of providing aid while stipulating that this aid is not responsible for the policies of the National Government. According to Bridges, "The China policy adopted by the current government in the past few years cannot be called a bipartisan policy in any way." Bridges added that he hopes the government has begun a new policy, and if this is the case, the Truman administration has been urged by congressional action. The Truman administration said that the military aid plan "should not be regarded as an assumption that the US government is responsible for the policies, actions, missions of China, or any situation that occurs in China at any time." Truman's remarks are considered particularly important by well-informed people, because this remark indicates that the US government still has reservations about China's domestic politics, which convinces Bridges and other members of Congress that the aid plan is valuable, is the report submitted by Lieutenant General Weidmeier to the Senate and House of Representatives in a closed-door meeting a few months ago. Weidmeier's "plan" includes more active US training of the Chinese army. It is rumored that Secretary of the Army Beyer is increasingly optimistic about the hope that the Chinese government army can win. Since July 23, China has purchased 9 million US dollars of military materials from the US armed forces. However, well-informed sources pointed out that China is still having difficulties in obtaining the aircraft fuel it needs. It is said that the obstacle lies in the Export Licensing Administration of the Department of Commerce. Because the Department of Commerce has not yet announced the Chinese distribution quantities for July, August, and September. However, the amount of aviation gasoline given to China in January, February, and March of this year was 60,000 barrels, and increased to 160,000 barrels in April, May, and June.

Although this aid to China plan was formulated by a special legislative conference, the transportation of aviation gasoline and other petroleum products is handled by the Export Administration Office of the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce cannot promptly announce the distribution quantities for July, August, and September, claiming that the reason is that the domestic needs of the United States are also increasing. It is said that the needs of various countries are increasing, and the government's highest authorities must decide how to distribute gasoline exports.

### Southern Anhui Will Establish a Pacification Department; Li Jue Will Be Appointed as Commander; Legislators and Supervisors from Anhui Province Request the Government to Recover Northern Anhui

It is internally decided that Li Jue, the former commander of the Fourteenth Pacification District stationed in Fuyang, will be appointed as the commander of the Southern Anhui Pacification District. The order will be announced soon.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 11th] After the National Army actively abandoned Cheyang, an important town in northern Anhui, the vast area of the northern Anhui Plain is now completely controlled by the bandits. Legislators and supervisors, National Assembly representatives, and speakers of the provincial assembly in northern Anhui called for the central government to pay attention to northern Anhui and recover Fuyang, an important town in northern Anhui. On the afternoon of the 11th at 7:00 PM, they hosted legislators and supervisors, National Assembly representatives, and fellow villagers from Anhui at the National Assembly Hall to discuss solutions. Dozens of people including Chen Fangxian, Chen Zifeng, Jin Weixi, Duanmu Jie, and Song Ying attended.

Finally, it was decided to establish the Anhui Association for Suppressing the Rebellion and Relieving the Disaster, with Jin Weiji, Chen Zifeng, and Duanmu Jie as conveners. Legislators and supervisors, National Assembly representatives, and fellow villagers from Anhui will be gathered to petition the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of National Defense, requesting the government to send a large army to recover northern Anhui as soon as possible and to relieve the refugees who fled from northern Anhui, and to ask the Ministry of Education to establish temporary middle schools to accommodate the northern Anhui youth.

### Central Government Agencies and Schools' Regular Expenses Increased Twofold Based on Original Budget; Subsidy Plan for Provinces and Cities Also Approved

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The principle of additional funding for the regular expenses of central government agencies and schools for the second half of the 37th year has been discussed and approved during the Political Affairs Council meeting on the 11th. According to this principle, the national treasury will bear an additional 158.4 billion yuan. This will be implemented from July and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The two principles are as follows: (1) All central government agencies and schools, regardless of their level, will have their original budget for the second half of the year increased twofold. However, second-level supervisory agencies may make overall adjustments to the total additional amount for their subordinate agencies, taking into account the complexity of their affairs. (2) The regular expenses of the Ministry of National Defense and its affiliated agencies, schools, and troops will be increased twofold based on the original budget of 319.88 billion yuan for June of this year, with no further additions to the increased portion.

Subsequently, adjustments will be made monthly based on the price index of office supplies. For agencies affiliated with ministries and commissions, two times the original budget will still be added based on the opinion of the budget review committee, with their supervisory agencies taking into account the complexity of affairs and local price conditions to make overall adjustments. (2) For travel allowances, the original standard set in the 24th year of the Republic of China was divided into six levels based on official rank, with daily rates of 18, 12, 8, 6, 4, and 2 yuan respectively. The revised standard will be six levels with daily rates of 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2 yuan. This standard will be multiplied by the cost of living index for civil servants in the Beijing-Shanghai area for the month of travel to determine the actual amount of travel expenses.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The subsidy plan for various provinces and cities for the second half of the 37th year has been approved at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 11th. Regarding the preparation of budgets for various provinces and cities for the second half of the 37th year, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Finance had previously jointly formulated guidelines, which were circulated by the Executive Yuan to the governments of various provinces and cities for compliance. The second provision stipulates that central subsidy income should be budgeted according to the approved plan for the first half of the year. Now, according to the detailed list of subsidies for various provinces and cities for the second half of the year submitted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, totaling 319,821,323,000 yuan, the Budget Review Committee reported that the construction subsidies for the first half of the year for the ten provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Beijing, Chongqing, and Guangzhou were adjusted within the budgets of those provinces and cities and reclassified from the central general subsidy amount, and have all been allocated. They should still be listed in the second half of the year to comply with the regulations. Errors in the calculation of living subsidies for Anhui Province and supplementary food expenses for Jiangxi and Fujian Provinces should be corrected and distributed. The central subsidies for thirty-two provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic of China, totaling 325,421,356,300 yuan, will be drawn from the general and special budget subsidy funds for provinces and cities, and all provinces and cities will be instructed to comply with the preparation of the general budget for revenues and expenditures.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan has recently issued instructions to various ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal governments, stating: "As we approach the end of political tutelage and the beginning of constitutional rule, all agencies with outstanding expense accounting reports that have not yet been submitted for review should promptly prepare and submit them in accordance with the law."

### Signs of Hong Kong Dollar Depreciation

Recently, the British government has taken two measures to restrict Hong Kong's trade: one is that, starting from July 20, the remittance of British pounds between London and Hong Kong is limited to 500 pounds; the other is that, starting from August 3, all foreign exchange profits obtained from the export of goods should be converted at the official rate and transferred to the Hong Kong government. However, exports to the United States, the Philippines, Macau, Korea, Japan, China, and the British pound area are not subject to this restriction. Therefore, the Far Eastern Economic Review of Hong Kong has published an article predicting that Hong Kong may withdraw from the British pound area. The reasons are as follows: "It is beneficial for Hong Kong to withdraw from the British pound area, both now and in the future. Most economic observers believe that Hong Kong is in fact just a large seaport and should not be included in the British pound area. Moreover, Hong Kong's trade is gradually decreasing, and in order to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity, no restrictions should be imposed at this time."

Are the British government's measures to restrict Hong Kong's trade reasonable? Is it possible for Hong Kong to withdraw from the British pound area? We will not discuss these issues for the time being, but in any case, some of the wealthy people in our country who regard Hong Kong as a paradise can wake up from their dreams! The prosperity of Hong Kong after the war is entirely a kind of deformed development, and the high value of the Hong Kong dollar is entirely created by a small number of speculative merchants in our country. Not to mention the situation in various parts of South China, even in Shanghai alone, illegal businesses privately converting Hong Kong currency are as numerous as carp crossing the river. Although the Economic Police Brigade of the police station has repeatedly cracked down on them, they are still "wildfires that cannot be extinguished, and spring breezes that bring them back to life." The day before yesterday, seven businesses were cracked down on, and the total amount of currency conversion reached more than 10 trillion, which is shocking. Although the 27 people arrested will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for processing, those merchants who regard Hong Kong as a paradise may not necessarily be alerted by this. We really don't understand how those money-grubbing merchants can be so confused. Even if they don't think about the country, they have to think about their own interests. Why should they risk breaking the law by privately converting the Hong Kong dollar that the British government does not take? May I ask, can the value of capital be maintained by escaping to Hong Kong? Greed overwhelms reason, to the point that they not only forget the interests of the country, but also don't even know how to plan for their own interests, which really makes us puzzled!

Some people say: "The Hong Kong government issues banknotes and also has a full reserve of British pounds. Even if Hong Kong's trade is still insufficient at present, Hong Kong can still maintain a balance of payments with foreign countries." This statement may seem reasonable to simple-minded merchants, but from our point of view, it is tantamount to admitting without being beaten that the Hong Kong dollar is about to depreciate.

First, the total amount of Hong Kong dollars issued has never been announced by the Hong Kong government, so we naturally cannot know. However, there are various signs that are sufficient to prove that the expansion of the Hong Kong dollar has also reached a considerable level. Just in terms of the Hong Kong dollars flowing out in various parts of South China, the number is already considerable. If the issuance of Hong Kong dollars does have a full reserve of British pounds, why should the British government restrict remittances between London and Hong Kong? Isn't it obvious that the British government is deeply afraid that the expansion of the Hong Kong dollar will affect the British pound?

Second, people in our country's industrial and commercial circles, because they have seen the expansion and persistence of domestic wars, have taken what they call "self-preservation measures." Those who have capital are naturally willing to risk breaking the law by privately converting Hong Kong currency and escaping to Hong Kong. Even those who have factories or shops are trying their best to prepare to move south to Hong Kong, which has suddenly increased the population of Hong Kong and created an unprecedented deformed prosperity. Since the need for Hong Kong dollar chips has greatly increased, the Hong Kong dollar will inevitably increase its issuance. However, Hong Kong is a small island, and the food needed by the citizens and the raw materials needed by the factories all need to be supplied from outside Hong Kong. Therefore, it is naturally not an easy task to maintain a balance of payments with foreign countries for a long time. If the Hong Kong government can indeed maintain a balance of payments with foreign countries, why should the British government require Hong Kong's exporters to convert their foreign exchange earnings at the official rate and transfer them to the Hong Kong government?

Based on the above analysis, it seems that we can conclude that the internal crisis lurking in Hong Kong is also very serious. Far-sighted British people have already felt this crisis. In the future, whether Hong Kong remains in the British pound area or withdraws from the British pound group, the depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar is always inevitable. Those wealthy people who have escaped to Hong Kong with capital, or those manufacturers who have moved their factories south to Hong Kong, may have been complacent in the past, thinking that their methods are superior to others, but now they should be able to suddenly realize it! Escaping with capital or moving factories south has not only damaged the health of our country's economy, but also, in the end, even their own interests may not be guaranteed. Can you still say that Hong Kong is your Shangri-La?

### Reforming the Monetary System Requires Caution; The Urgent Task is to Supervise Issuance; Pan Gongzhan Expresses His Views at a Current Affairs Symposium

[Our Newspaper] The Current Affairs Commentary Society held a current affairs symposium at the City Bank on the fourth floor yesterday. Pan Gongzhan, He Xiya, Zhu Baiying, Li Zongwen, Wei Youfei, Zhuang Zhihuan, Fang Qiuwei, and others participated. The symposium was hosted by chief editors Pan Shijie and Wei Yiping. The symposium started at 8 p.m. and ended at 9:30 p.m. The topic was centered on rescuing the legal tender crisis. Pan Gongzhan advocated caution in reforming the monetary system, believing that reform would inevitably fail and only cause disturbances in the state of unbalanced fiscal revenue and expenditure. The urgent task is to strictly supervise the issuance, and the fiscal deficit should never be made up for by means of issuance. Only in this way can the economic situation turn around, and the Ministry of Finance's right to issue currency must be taken back. There are three ways to offset the deficit: (1) Increase the income of state-owned enterprises, (2) Improve tax collection methods. Under the current system, the amount of tax revenue that actually enters the national treasury is less than half. In order to adapt to the actual situation of our country, it may be advisable to go backward and adopt a tax farming system, which would be more beneficial. (3) Sell compensation materials, surplus materials, enemy and puppet property, and state-owned enterprises. Pan also believes that today, the minister of finance should first have the confidence to meet fiscal expenditures without increasing currency issuance, otherwise, there is no need to cling to the position. Zhu Baiying, Li Zongwen, and others spoke successively, all advocating that future issuance must be independent. Even if there is still a limited deficit in fiscal revenue and expenditure, it must go through legal procedures and borrow from the central bank, and everything must be handled according to banking principles in order to get on the right track. In addition, there are many economic reform plans currently under consideration by the government, and the outside world has made various speculations about them, with many rumors. In fact, it is more beneficial to adopt a public discussion method for the determination of major principles and plans than to make secret decisions.

### Jiangsu Direct Goods Tax Agency Only Lays Off Over 700 People

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] This time, the merger and reorganization of the various levels of the direct and goods tax agencies of the Ministry of Finance into national tax agencies led to rumors that more than 3,000 employees in the Jiangsu region were laid off. The person in charge of the National Taxation Administration said: The total number of personnel in the original direct tax agencies at all levels in the Jiangsu region was 1,280, and the total number of personnel in the goods tax agencies at all levels was 1,452, totaling 2,732. The total number of personnel used in the National Taxation Bureau and the various levels of the Inspection and Collection Bureau after this merger and reorganization is 1,957, which is only a reduction of 775 people compared with the total number of personnel in the original direct and goods tax agencies. The laid-off personnel this time have a set of layoff standards, which are very fair, and so on. The previous rumors do not match the facts.

### Second District Supervision Group of Jiangsu Province Discusses Treatment of Public School Teachers

Decided to Implement Partial Salary in Kind (Rice) System

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 11th Dispatch] Shen Peng, Zhang Da, and other members of the Supervision Group for Suppression of Rebellion and Implementation of Administration in the Second District of Jiangsu Province, today discussed mass training and financial affairs in Suzhou in groups. As a result, it was deemed that the budget expenditure of 240 billion yuan for the second half of the year was too large, and the additional item of land tax in the income accounted for 80%, which placed too heavy a burden on farmers, and it was decided to revise it to be fair. Regarding the treatment of public school teachers, it was decided to implement a partial salary in kind (rice) system, that is, each person will be issued one dan of rice to offset 10 yuan of base salary, and the remainder will be issued in accordance with the index promulgated by the central government, without discount or delay. If the above resolution can be put into practice, it will be good news for public school teachers in Jiangsu Province.

It specially cabled the chairmen of the four provinces to promptly organize a joint opium production agency. It is heard that armed suppression will be carried out to eliminate opium. In addition, Song Jiuxin, the former special commissioner for opium suppression, has been found to be corrupt and derelict in his duties, extorting money from various counties, and has been sent to the local court for legal action.

### The Amount of Japan's Compensation is Far Above US Aid, A Certain Expert Urges the Chinese People Not to Ignore It

[Our Newspaper] A certain expert on Japanese affairs recently said that the Chinese people are currently paying too much attention to US aid and ignoring the issue of Japanese compensation, which is not correct, because Japanese compensation is the right that our country should have obtained after eight years of resistance, and the amount is far above US aid. As of this time, our country has only obtained US$60 million in compensation materials. Officials of the delegation stationed in Japan, who usually do not want to offend the Allied Headquarters, are also unable to bear it at this time and have made public criticisms. It is hoped that the Chinese people and the government can promptly and firmly demand from the US side that the compensation issue be resolved smoothly before the conclusion of the peace treaty. The expert also pointed out that according to the principle of damages, Japan should compensate our country US$65 billion. If calculated according to the principle of ability to compensate under the temporary demolition item, our country should receive US$2 billion, of which US$600 million should be obtained from the distribution of materials from 17 factories. However, due to the US partiality towards Japan, only 10% of this has been obtained so far. In terms of the return of materials, after repeated negotiations, the return of 4,000 tons of copper-nickel coins was finally agreed, but there is still gold worth US$104 million that was looted by the Japanese army during the war that has not yet been agreed to be returned.

If the trip is successful, it will only be a private inspection and he will absolutely not be responsible for any mission. All kinds of rumors circulating outside are rumors.

### Reuters News is Inaccurate; Zhuan Jiaojin States in Nanjing

Did Not Suggest That the Government Send Troops to Western Yunnan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Zhuan Jiaojin, captain of the Border Survey Team of the Ministry of Interior, responded to reporters on the 11th regarding the news related to the team and the Sino-Myanmar border as reported in Reuters' Nanjing 10th dispatch, saying that the Reuters reporter did not come to interview any news that day. The team was dispatched to Western Yunnan this time, and its mission was purely to technically establish boundary markers, and everything else was not within the team's mission. The Reuters report's so-called suggestion that the government send troops to the Western Yunnan border is inaccurate, and the claim of discovering a silver mine is even more absurd. The only silver mine currently developed on the Sino-Myanmar border is the Lufang Silver Mine. This was jointly developed by China and Britain in the past, and China and Britain signed a contract in 1937. Now Reuters has suddenly released this news, which is indeed detrimental to Sino-Myanmar relations.

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 10th Dispatch] Baoding is located on the front line, and smuggling is becoming increasingly rampant. A major smuggling case of subsidizing banditry was uncovered here on the 8th. Four rubber-wheeled carts fully loaded with five large bags of cement were being transported out of the city. When passing through the Shigou checkpoint, they were able to pass smoothly because the company commander of the County Security Regiment stationed there had prior orders from the regimental commander to release them. When they reached Beida Ran Village south of the city, they were intercepted by the People's Service Team of the Qingyuan County Party Committee, and the people and goods were escorted back to the city. It is heard that the main culprit in this case is Li, the deputy commander of the Eighth District Security Forces here, and Tian, the staff officer of the department. People in Baoding are all shocked. Many perpetrators are currently being sent to the garrison command for legal action.

### Letters to the Editor

In your newspaper on the 11th of this month, there was a news item about a major brawl at the Wuxi Railway Station. The content does not entirely align with the actual events. After investigation, it was found that the freight station porters from Wuxi signed a contract in the spring of the 35th year of the Republic to undertake the loading and unloading work at the station. The contract was renewed last year. This year, as all major stations are still in the planning and reorganization phase, a new contract has not yet been signed. The Wuxi porters, seeking to participate in this work, have had disputes with the out-of-town porters for a long time, and numerous attempts at mediation have been unsuccessful. Recently, the Business Section of this office telegraphed both sides' foremen to come to Shanghai on July 31st to discuss the matter at the section. At that time, both sides were still urged to resolve the matter themselves amicably. There were no statements such as "implementing the mediated settlement, cooperating together, and personally instructing the Wuxi porters to resume work soon." Because the mediation case was never established in the first place, how could it be implemented? There was also no way to personally instruct them to resume work soon. This is indeed an inaccurate rumor. Correspondingly, we request a correction. The Transportation Department of the Jinghu District Railway Administration.

### Xu Prefecture's All-Night Storm and Rain, Old Yellow River Floods, Approximately 5,000 Households Homeless

Approximately 5,000 households are now homeless, making it the biggest flood disaster in over 30 years. The disaster situation is extremely severe. Furthermore, the walls of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters were also submerged by a foot, showing the scale of the flooding. The victims are sleeping in the open air by the water's edge, in a truly miserable state.

### Three Envoys Meet with Molotov Again, Negotiations Approaching Decisive Stage, West German Government Formation Plan Delayed, Attitudes of Britain, America, and France Not Unified

[Our Report] London, 11th broadcast from Moscow: American Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, along with the British and French envoys, has received new instructions from their governments. They began discussions at the American Embassy at 7 p.m. on the 11th, preparing to meet with Molotov again on the night of the 11th or the 12th.

[Our Report] London, 11th broadcast: Western powers have different views on the four-power talks in the Kremlin. France is slightly optimistic, Britain is pessimistic, and the United States remains tight-lipped, maintaining silence. Some diplomats intend to conflate France's attitude with reports that the Western powers' plans for the West German government have reached a deadlock. Although France has expressed agreement with the London resolutions regarding West Germany, it is quite reluctant and hopes to delay this decisive measure. However, if Britain and the United States want to delay the West German government plan as the price for convening a four-power conference, they will inevitably encounter great difficulties. Almost all British and American newspapers insist that the West must "stand firm" on its plans for West Germany.

[Central News Agency, London, 10th Dispatch] After receiving the latest report on the Kremlin talks, the British Foreign Office continued its usual diplomatic activities today. The American and French ambassadors to Britain held separate talks with Bevin and his chief advisor on German affairs, Strachi, but the three representatives of the so-called "Crisis Committee" did not meet simultaneously. Officials here remain silent on the progress of the negotiations to date, but they have reiterated that Britain does not want to abandon its demand to lift the Berlin blockade, nor does it want to terminate its plans to organize a West German government. Britain and the United States are currently preparing plans to continue the airlift to Berlin this winter.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th Dispatch] French Foreign Minister Schumann expressed cautious optimism that the talks between the three-nation representatives and the Moscow authorities have reached a decisive stage. He believes that after Svetlin makes concrete proposals to the three-nation representatives, the Western powers will propose other suggestions and a draft agreement in reply, and he believes that if this draft agreement is satisfactory to both parties, a four-power conference may be held in Paris before the United Nations meeting convenes. Schumann continued, "I hope that the curtain of diplomatic secrecy can be lifted soon to inform the world that the overall situation has indeed reached stability."

### Trade Relations Between East and West Zones in Germany Seek Improvement, Soviet Union Transports 8,000 Tons of Wheat to Supply Berlin

### Little Stalin's Behind-the-Scenes Life (3)

— Translated by this newspaper's translation department (Originally published in the August 17th issue of the American [Observer Magazine])

Lust for Women, Dissolute Behavior

After being on the front lines for a few months, Vasili had to become depressed, irritable, and bad-tempered. So he often used the excuse of taking short trips to Moscow. There he had a group of directors, actors, and cinematographers ready to fool around with him, drinking, singing, and other wild pleasures. In Moscow, he had a confidant named Carmen, a cinematographer and a man of elegance. He knew how to prepare Chinese dishes, cocktails, and other special drinks. Vasili greatly appreciated these things. However, when Carmen married a young and beautiful woman named Xenia, Vasili immediately fell in love with her and took her to the front lines.

This small incident was the longest-lasting of Vasili's many love affairs. The women he ravaged were simply countless: dancers from the Bolshoi Theatre, movie stars, stage actresses, beautiful female secretaries, and many beautiful girls he met by chance. He took them to villas outside the city, where they could indulge in debauchery and pleasure without being disturbed by others.

Vasili often acted with an air of absolute authority in Moscow. One day, he took a red ballerina into the city in a car, which broke down on the road. He calmly stopped the first car that came along, which happened to belong to a deputy minister. Regardless of everything, he declared that he was Vasili Stalin, kicked all the passengers out of the car, and drove away with his mistress.

On another occasion, in a woman's room, he wanted to call a friend, but it happened that his friend was already talking to someone else. He tried to connect twice but failed, so he ordered the female switchboard operator to cut off their line, which she refused. Angered, Vasili roared, "Do you know who's talking to you? I am Stalin. I'll have you fired tomorrow." His threat came true, and the female switchboard operator was eventually dismissed.

Reprimanded by His Father, His Nature is Hard to Change

There is no doubt that special agents reported Stalin's son's mischief, the scandals in the wine shops, the women he humiliated, and other anecdotes to Stalin at any time. But it was very difficult to stop his wild behavior. Even after Vasili married, he could not be calmed down. Although he had children and his father gave him strict admonitions, he could not change his nature and continued to fool around as before. His father also knew that he sometimes got drunk and couldn't help but express his grievances, such as, "The situation all around is really too miserable... When will we be able to make sure everyone has enough food and clothing?"

Stalin knew about his son's absurdity, but he always cared about his happiness and future. In early 1946, the aging Marshal finally signed the order promoting Vasili to general, so that Vasili could maintain a special position even after his father's death.

The Proletariat Produces a Prodigal Son

Stalin's daughter, Svetlana, is now twenty-four years old and married to a gentle and polite engineer who works in the Planning Commission and is not qualified to hold important government positions. This can make her safer and live a peaceful life. Stalin loved her more than his other children. He not only provided her with unlimited access to cars and all kinds of good food and supplies in the Kremlin stores and commissaries, but also occasionally granted her requests involving political issues.

Svetlana lost her mother early (1932) and was more sensitive than her brother Vasili, growing up in solitude. She devoted herself to studying music, and her favorite piano pieces mostly expressed melancholy and loneliness.

Stalin's eldest son, Yakov, was born when Stalin was very young, and his wife, Svanidze, died in 1907. After Stalin remarried, he gradually forgot about his eldest son, Yakov, because he loved his stepmother, Alyosha, and focused all his attention on the new family. Therefore, Yakov became jealous and angrily returned to his hometown of Georgia, taking up an unimportant position.

Stalin's three children proved the old truth that "extraordinary people rarely have extraordinary children." But Vasili proved a new truth: "The proletariat dictator can also produce a prodigal son." (The End)

### Hu Xinyi's Gold and Banknote Case: Thorough Investigation Reveals Unexpected Evidence; Huge Safe Opened, Nothing Inside

[Report from this newspaper] The black market gold and banknote kingpin, Hu Xinyi, will soon be brought to trial after being prosecuted by the Special Criminal Tribunal's prosecutor. However, a mysterious safe in the case has not yet been opened. According to the rough draft of the day's transactions seized by the police on June 29 from the secret room of Jintai Yarn Company, which was set up by Hu Xinyi at 331 Jiangxi Middle Road, the number of gold bars that had been transacted was recorded to be more than 80. At that time, the police officers in charge saw a huge safe in the shop and speculated that it must contain a large number of gold bars, so they intended to open the safe. However, Hu claimed that the safe belonged to the person in charge of a certain organization and could not be opened without authorization. To be cautious, the police officers immediately placed seals on the safe. After Hu was arrested, the police department, at the request of a financial tycoon, allowed him to be released on bail that night, but he was still summoned and detained the next day. Since then, he has been transferred to the Special Criminal Tribunal for investigation and prosecution. Up to now, this mysterious safe has not been opened. After the case occurred, cases related to the Hu case were also revealed one after another. In order to thoroughly understand the case, the police department, with the approval of the Special Criminal Tribunal, yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the police department, together with a representative of a certain organization, Hu's defense lawyers Li Jinfang and Tian Chang, Li Bojun, and Lai Shengqi, the person in charge of Jintai Yarn Company, went to the shop to jointly open this mysterious safe. Unexpectedly, when the seals were removed and the safe door was opened, it was empty. Everyone believed that this huge and exquisite safe was definitely not for decoration, and it must contain valuable items. Now that it was empty, it was even more suspicious. According to Cheng Yikuan, the captain of the police force, after the incident, he said that he had sufficient evidence to prove Hu's various facts of operating black market gold and banknotes, and although the safe was empty, it could not cover up his crimes.

There were also some workers lined up in a long snake formation, leaning against the wall and dying.

### Facilitating Quick Cargo Pickup for Merchants: Railway Bureau Introduces Delivery of Freight Bills, Scheduled for Implementation in Late June

The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, to enhance service and facilitate quick cargo pickup for merchants, has formulated a "Delivery of Freight Bills" method, scheduled for implementation in late June. Sixteen points for attention have been established, and key aspects are outlined below: (1) Restrictions on Delivery of Freight Bills: When consignors entrust the railway to transport goods, except for those requesting issuance of "Pickup Slips" or dispatching escorts, to avoid delays in delivering "Freight Bill" receipt copies and hindering pickup, requests to have the originating station deliver them to the destination station free of charge may be accommodated. However, no letters or other items may be included. (2) Registration of Consignees for Delivered Freight Bills: Consignees who regularly receive delivered "Freight Bills" at a certain station may request registration at the destination station to prevent disputes arising from unauthorized pickup of "Freight Bills" and goods. During registration, the consignee's name or business name, detailed address, and telephone number should be filled in on the "Registration Card for Consignees of Delivered Freight Bills," and the consignee should affix their seal for verification. (3) Requesting Delivery of Freight Bills: When originating stations encounter consignors requesting delivery of freight bill receipt copies, they must have them fill in the "Please Deliver Freight Bill" wording in the special instructions column of the "Consignment Note." The consignee's name or business name and detailed address should be filled in precisely. (4) Freight bills entrusted to this railway for delivery should be sent in the railway's freight bill envelope. (5) Consignors should deliver the freight bill to the station within 20 minutes of receiving it. The station is not responsible for any delays. (6) Arrival notifications are limited to one attempt. The notification slip is divided into two copies, with the first copy given to the consignee as proof of pickup at the station, and the second copy returned to the station for record-keeping. (7) For freight bills delivered by station-dispatched messengers, the standard for calculating storage fees or vehicle demurrage fees is calculated from the time of station notification, after deducting the prescribed free storage or free demurrage time. However, (1) if the consignor causes the delay or (2) if the consignee's address is unclear and notification is impossible, the calculation should begin from the time the goods arrive, deducting the prescribed free time.

### Rising Utility Prices Drive Up Cost of Living: Industrial Sector Hit Twice, Unable to Cope

[Report from our newspaper] August saw unprecedented surges in utility prices, significantly impacting the cost of living in the first half of this month. The industrial sector, severely affected, finds it unsustainable. Yesterday, a reporter visited a local industrialist who stated: The prices of utilities and rationed rice have increased several times, inevitably driving up the cost of living. The direct and indirect threats to factories are severe. In the current vicious cycle of inflation, the rate of price increases for industrial products is falling behind the increasing costs of raw materials and other expenses. Consequently, factories with weak capital, to survive, have no choice but to devalue and dump their products, a move akin to drinking poison to quench thirst, a form of slow suicide. At the same time, factories with more capital are also suffering significant losses. He believes that the cost of living index is not a primary factor in price increases, as the index is based on prices. He considers the high-percentage increases in utility prices to be a misguided government measure, stating that even if companies are indeed losing money, adjustments should be gradual, rather than suddenly jumping from "loss" to "profit." Utility price hikes directly stimulate the entire market and the lives of all city residents. He strongly supports the city council's position on this matter and hopes for positive outcomes.

### Insurance Industry Seeks to Avert Crisis: Price Index-Linked Dynamic Value Insurance Under Discussion by Association for Imminent Implementation

The insurance industry is currently facing a severe crisis. Due to soaring prices, the valuation of premiums and compensation is increasingly disconnected, leading to sluggish business for insurance companies, many on the verge of collapse. To maintain value, some policyholders are increasingly purchasing foreign currency-denominated insurance from foreign companies, representing a significant foreign exchange leakage. According to Mr. Luo Beichen, Chairman of the Municipal Insurance Association, the association is considering the introduction of price index-linked insurance and dynamic value insurance to allow policyholders to maintain value in line with prices, benefiting both policyholders and companies. He states that this new insurance system is under discussion by the association and will be implemented in the near future.

### British Tramway Employees Brawl: Trial Concluded, Sentence Set for the 18th: Witnesses on Both Sides Offer Conflicting Accounts, Focus on Bloodstains on Clothing

[Report from our newspaper] On the morning of June 20th, Shu Guixiang, a ticket seller from the preparation team of the British Tramway Company, disobeyed the dispatch assignment of Wu Lijun from the Traffic Department and threw an aluminum ticket box at Wu, injuring Wu's left eye. Wu reported this to Mr. Matteson (British), the acting general traffic manager, who dismissed Shu. The next day, Shu led several people to Matteson's office to argue, leading to a verbal confrontation and then a physical fight, resulting in injuries on both sides. Afterward, this triggered a strike by tramway workers. Subsequently, Matteson and Shu filed lawsuits against each other at the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing each other of assault. The prosecutor jointly filed public charges of assault. The case was tried yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Xie Zhiying. Over ten witnesses from both sides, including Liu Xuesai, Wang Jinsheng, Yang Pengsheng, Sun Rongsheng, Wang Jufu, Wang Jiping, Mi Wenliang, Sun Gensheng, Zhou Guisun, Liu Songqi, Zhang Tiegui, Hu Jingrong, Shu Tinghe, and Garth Stone, as well as Qiu Changjiang, the chairman of the Tramway Workers' Union, were summoned to court for questioning. Many other workers were present in the courtroom to observe. First, Shu Guixiang testified: "The dispatcher had a grudge against me and did not assign shifts in order. I refused, and the dispatcher became abusive, calling me a 'dung-eater' and a 'pig.' In anger, I preferred not to do business and threw the ticket box, unintentionally injuring him." Matteson testified: "Shu did not follow company rules, and I dismissed him on orders. However, I still told him to appeal at the office, but Shu did not come, so I dismissed him. The next day, Shu came to my office alone, with several other people waiting outside. After Shu entered the room, he started cursing and insulting me. Knowing his intentions were not good, I tried to leave to avoid confrontation. Shu then grabbed my belt and punched me in the chest. At the elevator entrance, Shu again punched me in the head." Shu continued: "When I entered the room to appeal, Matteson, relying on his British power, was aggressive. I had no chance to speak. He punched me first. I grabbed his belt because he had broken my head and wanted to escape. My uniform was covered in blood. At the same time, Garth Stone helped him grab my hands. Only Garth Stone was present as a witness at the time. The other capitalist witnesses present today were all instructed to come." Qiu Changjiang, the chairman of the Union, stated: "After this incident, the Union considered it a labor dispute and had the right to mediate. Wu Lijun and Shu Guixiang had both accepted mediation, but Matteson still insisted on dismissing Shu, which violated decades of company practice." The court then questioned Matteson's witnesses Sun Rongsheng, Wang Yafu, Garth Stone, and eleven others, who all stated firmly that Shu had indeed slapped Matteson. However, they did not know where the bloodstains on Shu's clothing came from. Shu Guixiang's witnesses, including Liu Xuesai and several others, also stated in the same tone that they had indeed seen Garth Stone grab Shu's hand and had seen Shu's clothes stained with blood. Shi Xueshan, a plainclothes police officer from the Huangpu Branch, said: "There was a fight, but I was not present at the time, so I couldn't determine who hit whom." At this point, the focus of the court's interrogation was concentrated on the bloodstains on Shu's clothing. After repeated questioning of both sides, the trial seemed to have some clues. The prosecutor then stood up and stated the intent of the indictment. After the lawyers made their arguments, the court announced the end of the debate and set the sentencing for the 18th of this month.

### Old Woman Swallows Corrosive Liquid in Front of Bank, Attempts Suicide

Yesterday at 11:00 AM, in front of the Bank of China on the Bund at Number 17, a 66-year-old woman swallowed nitric acid and collapsed. She was discovered and rushed to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. Whether she can survive the ordeal is uncertain. It is reported that the old woman lives in the kitchen of Number 6, Lane 1, Xinzha Road. The reason for her suicide attempt is unknown.

### Entrusted House: Cuckoo Occupies Nest: Xing Weide Sued for Forgery

[Report from our newspaper] Guo Congshan, a local resident who formerly served in the Third War Zone, was transferred to Shanghai with the army in October of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945) when the war of resistance was won. In October of the same year, the Japanese Military Supplies Receiving Committee allocated a house at 18C Huangdu Road to Guo for residence. In March of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), Guo was transferred to Guam by the Materials Supply Bureau, and he entrusted the house to his friend Xing Weide for safekeeping and residence. After Xing moved into the house, he forged a letter purportedly written by Guo Congshan himself on April 30 of the same year to the China Trust Bureau, stating: "I previously used a house at 18C Huangdu Road rented by your bureau. Because I am about to leave Shanghai and no longer need it, I am willing to unconditionally offer it for use by the China Economic Research Institute, and please be responsible for its safekeeping. Please collect the required fees directly from the institute, and I am not involved." After the transfer procedure was completed, Xing then occupied the nest like a cuckoo. When Guo returned to Shanghai and found out, negotiations were ineffective, so he filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office accusing Xing of trespassing, obstructing his rights, and forgery. The office has concluded its investigation, dismissing the charges of trespassing and obstructing rights because the plaintiff had not yet obtained proper lease rights to the house, which should be resolved in civil court. However, Xing was indicted on charges of forgery.

### Municipal Primary School Staff Request Collection of Advanced Study Fees: Director Li Promises to Consider

[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Primary School Staff Association, to request the continued collection of teacher advanced study fees for the next semester, sent representatives Li Zhanren, Tu Shiling, Qian Shenzhi, Huang Zhuyu, and Cao Junshi to the Bureau of Education yesterday morning to meet with Director Li. Director Li stated that he has always believed that the collection of advanced study fees from municipal schools increases the burden on parents and hopes they will not make this request. The representatives repeatedly stated the reasons for the collection, believing that although the collection of advanced study fees from municipal schools seems to increase the burden on parents, its importance lies in stabilizing the lives of teachers and increasing educational efficiency. If teacher salaries can indeed maintain their pre-position standards, there would be no need to make this request. Although salaries are currently based on the cost of living index, the base salary is too low, and monthly income is not even enough for two shi of white rice. If the bureau insists on not collecting advanced study fees, how can teachers' lives be stabilized and how can education in this city be advanced? After more than half an hour of explanation, Director Li said that he would consider it. It is reported that the Bureau of Education will invite representatives from all sectors of the city and the principals and staff of municipal primary and secondary schools to seriously discuss whether to continue collecting advanced study fees for the next semester within the next few days.

### Zhejiang Land Reform in the Brewing Stage

— Our reporter Huang Xingtian

[Report from our Hangzhou, 9th] Chen Gongzhi has been in charge of Zhejiang's government for a month. Chen, upon taking office, spoke to reporters about his policy guidelines, stating that they would ensure security and increase production. In Chen's new policies over the past month, apart from the document reform that has materialized, the so-called two major policy guidelines remain at the stage of "hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs." In fact, these two basic guidelines were what the previous chairman, Shen Chengzhang, wanted to do, tried to do, but failed to do well. Chen's new approach to Zhejiang, the real new hope for the people of Zhejiang, lies in the land reform movement that is in the brewing stage.

The reason for Zhejiang's current widespread poverty and unrest in the countryside cannot be denied as having significant political factors. However, objectively analyzing, the decline (or even near collapse) of the rural economy and the lack of security for tenant farmers are the main keys. Chairman Chen also understands this very well. His advocacy of economic construction and increased production aims to curb the source of unrest by boosting the local economy and stabilizing people's lives, which is undoubtedly a fundamental solution. However, relying solely on economic construction with plans but without funding is like trying to put out a fire with water from afar. The most fundamental solution is still Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposed "equalization of land ownership." Zhejiang is a province of farmers, and the farmer problem (i.e., the land problem) should be rationally resolved.

Content of the Plan Not Yet Revealed

In fact, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has always paid close attention to the farmer problem and has made greater efforts than other provinces in how to use land and rationally allocate the interests of tenant farmers and landlords. "25% Rent Reduction" was first implemented in Zhejiang. After twenty years of effort, the 25% rent reduction has been widely implemented throughout the province. (This is also one of the important reasons why Zhejiang's security is better than that of neighboring provinces today.) However, in today's situation, relying solely on 25% rent reduction is not enough to stabilize the countryside. Therefore, when Chairman Chen spoke about the rural economic problem at his first press conference on the evening of July 16, he stated that he would pilot a moderate land reform. The plan for implementing this reform has been handed over to the Land Administration Bureau for drafting, but it has not yet been approved, and the provincial government has always kept the content of this plan a secret. There are two views on this from the outside: one is that Chairman Chen is cautious in his work, and the other is that he is afraid of offending landlords and causing opposition from local forces.

Four Principles to Maintain Moderation

How moderate will Chen's land reform be? Although it can be understood from the four principles of the plan: (1) Handling the contract registration of land, implementing the 25% rent reduction thoroughly based on the registration, and protecting the interests of tenant farmers. (2) Limiting the maximum amount of land owned by individuals and groups. Excess land will be purchased by the government and resold to tenant farmers. (3) Land not owned by landlords, wasteland, and other land, or land whose purchase is applied for by tenant farmers, or land that is not legally used in accordance with government regulations, will be purchased by the government in accordance with the law and transferred to tenant farmers. (4) The government will use large areas of wasteland and tidal flats to establish self-cultivation cooperative farms, recruiting poor farmers and tenant farmers to cultivate them. The prerequisites for this principle are: (1) Carrying out the reform legally, and (2) Not harming the rights and interests of the owners.

Sorting Out Land Registry: Expediting Registration

Let's not talk about whether the degree is enough. As long as the government is determined to do it, and does it quickly and effectively, then that's very good. Speaking of doing it, the first difficulty encountered is that the government does not have a list of land ownership in the whole province and does not know who owns how much land. This is the problem of land registry sorting. The central government allocates Zhejiang's measurement funds for sorting out land registry, only enough for fifty mu per year, while the province has 150 million mu of land. In other words, it will take three hundred years to complete the land survey. Therefore, only local funds can be raised, and the central government prohibits the additional collection of land taxes, making it difficult to handle the land registry under such dual constraints. Fortunately, Hong Jichuan, the director of Zhejiang's Land Administration Bureau, is a visionary and capable person with the courage to act. He sought help from the public opinion organs, and with the consent of the provincial and county councils, he collected land registry sorting fees on the grain tax (which was approved by the central government as a separate local law for each province after discussions at last year's National Land Administration Conference.) In the past three years, twenty-one counties have been completed, plus the twenty counties that were completed before and during the war, totaling forty-one counties. Compared with other provinces, it is already a brilliant achievement, but it is still far from the degree needed. Therefore, how to expedite registration in counties where surveying has been completed but land registration has not been done, and how to quickly complete land registration in counties where land registry has not been sorted out, is the current new issue for the Land Administration Bureau. The key to this lies in effectively cooperating with local people and in the soundness of grassroots politics. As long as the grassroots politics are sound, those township and village heads who are landlords or property owners can have a long-term vision and cooperate to promote it, and it will be easy to do. However, the personnel constraints in Chinese politics are often the fatal injuries of such things.

Going Deep into the People: Propaganda and Investigation

Recently, Chairman Chen decided to set up propagandists in various counties and cities to go deep into the people and promote government orders. I think that if Chairman Chen has the determination and courage to carry out land reform, he can take advantage of these propagandists to go deep into every corner of the countryside and directly investigate land owners from the farmers (mainly tenant farmers). Since land reform is to help tenant farmers and find ways for tenant farmers, the investigation will be carried out smoothly and quickly. As for the formulation of the maximum limit, it should be determined based on the abundance and poverty of the soil, so the problem is not in the rigid stipulation of ten mu or twenty mu, but in having a correct investigation first. Otherwise, landlords can still use means of concealing the truth to privately preserve their land.

Secondly, there is the problem of funds. The government must prepare a huge fund to purchase the property of landlords, and in fact, tenant farmers are unable to purchase land in one go, so they must be allowed to purchase land in installments. In addition, the establishment of self-cultivation cooperative farms also requires huge funds, so this fund is quite large and must be raised by issuing land bonds or other means.

Pilot Projects in Wuxing and Other Counties

Finally, regarding the implementation of land reform, the provincial government has decided to pilot it first in Wuxing, Changxing, Deqing, Chongde, Tongxiang, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Haining, Haiyan, and other counties in one district where security is good and land registry has been sorted out. According to my personal observation, the purpose of land reform is to help tenant farmers, eliminate poor farmers, and make them self-cultivating farmers, so as to curb the source of unrest, and the biggest source of unrest is precisely in the mountainous and poor counties where security is poor and banditry is rampant. Therefore, to curb the source of unrest and stabilize the countryside, it seems that it should be started from the counties where security is worrying and the counties with more poor farmers.

In short, Chairman Chen's moderate land reform plan is a great contribution of his new policies to the people of Zhejiang, and the farmers who cultivate the land in Zhejiang are looking forward to this promising prospect.

### Tragedy at Hangzhou Zhenxing Iron Shop: Erroneously Hammering a Grenade Leads to Death

[Report from our Hangzhou, 11th] An explosion tragedy occurred in Hangzhou's Baoyou Bridge . The Zhenxing Iron Shop erroneously hammered a hand grenade, killing four members of the family and seriously injuring five others.

### Prohibition and Trafficking of Opium: A Sole Monopoly

Yao Yinglong Detained in Chongqing

[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 11th] The Chongqing security authorities on the 11th detained Yao Yinglong, a Major General High Staff Officer of the active Xichang Police Department, who is involved in a widespread case. Yao formerly served as the Special Commissioner for Opium Prohibition in Xikang under the Ministry of Interior. He arrived in Chongqing from Kangding and Ya'an. According to a report from the current Special Commissioner for Opium Prohibition in Xikang, Song Shuofu, Yao is suspected of serious crimes involving the protection and trafficking of narcotics. He was about to flee from Chongqing when security personnel, acting on this lead, arrested Yao at a certain hotel. Sources close to Song Shuofu stated that Song left Chongqing for Chengdu on the 11th to investigate and collect relevant evidence in this case.

### Severe Flooding in Sixty Counties of Jiangxi; Particularly Disastrous Along the Shores of Poyang Lake; Special Commissioner Song Xunxin on Disaster Relief States that Water Recession and Resumption of Farming Are Unlikely in the Short Term

[Our Nanchang Dispatch on the 11th] Song Xunxin, the Special Commissioner for Disaster Relief from the Ministry of Social Affairs, recently accompanied Xue Qiuquan, Director of the Social Affairs Office, and others to inspect the disaster situation in Nanchang and counties along the shores of Poyang Lake, such as Yugan and Jinxian. He returned to the province from Yingtan on the evening of the 9th. According to Song, there are now reports of flooding in sixty counties of Jiangxi Province, with the disaster being truly severe, particularly along the shores of Poyang Lake, and slightly less severe in southern Jiangxi. In the disaster areas, many people's fields and houses are still submerged. Seventy to eighty percent of the early rice harvest was lost due to flooding, and autumn crops cannot be planted as the floodwaters have not receded. Although a very small number of upland fields have been cultivated for autumn crops, they have recently withered due to severe heat and lack of rain. Judging from the current water levels, it is unlikely that the counties along the shores of Poyang Lake will see water recession and resumption of farming in the short term, as the Changjiang River's water level has not significantly decreased, preventing Poyang Lake from draining. Xue Qiuquan also deeply felt that this year's agricultural production in the Poyang Basin is almost hopeless, affecting the province's overall grain production and people's livelihoods. They both believe that issues such as epidemic prevention, medical care, dike restoration, and resumption of farming after this great disaster should be addressed with countermeasures to save the nearly ten million disaster victims. Song concluded by saying that it is strange that the Jiangxi disaster, despite its severity, has not attracted attention from people in society. For example, even though the Jiangxi floods have been ongoing, the provincial government did not report the disaster to the central government before [officials] left Beijing. The Ministry of Social Affairs' initial allocation of 35 billion [currency units] was made on its own initiative. Even the recent disaster reports submitted have not been prepared in accordance with the central government's regulations, failing to provide a factual record of the disaster and statistical figures, making it difficult for the central government to provide relief. Song and others are scheduled to go to Jiujiang and Hukou on the 12th for further disaster assessment.

### The Bloodshed Case of Tao Guifang in Changshu; The Murderer Apprehended in Nantong

[Our Changshu Dispatch on the 10th] After Tao Guifang, the Baochang (chief of Baojia system) of Fuping Township, Shazhou District, was shot and killed by thugs, the military and police authorities immediately launched a tight pursuit.

### Three Medical Disputes in Zhenjiang

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 11th] Three medical dispute cases occurred in Zhenjiang in recent days: (1) The Provincial Zhenjiang Hospital refused to admit Wang Ye'an, an emergency patient, causing the patient to die in front of the hospital. (2) Jia Ronglan, an obstetrician, committed negligent homicide during delivery, causing the placenta of the parturient Jin Shi to retract, resulting in death. (3) The renowned doctor Gao Enpei killed Han Qing, the director of a barber shop, with a single injection. The news spread, causing public outcry. It is reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Health Authorities, the Provincial and County Medical Associations, and the Midwives Association are paying close attention to this and are jointly dispatching personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter and make it public after the incident is clarified.

### The Corpse of a Glamorous Woman Found on Hui Mountain in Wuxi; Tour Guide Li Meiyu Was Disfigured and Strangled

[Our Wuxi Dispatch on the 10th] Li Meiyu, a tour guide from the "Good Friends" guiding agency at No. 4 Youhui Lane, Tongyun Road, went to Hui Mountain with two clients on the afternoon of the 7th. Late at night, on the summit of Ermao Peak, the murderer strangled Meiyu and stole her jewelry. The body was discovered by a woodcutter on the morning of the 8th. Yesterday, the deceased's husband, Yu Baoyi, rushed to Wuxi from Suzhou after hearing the news, and identified the corpse as his wife at Hui Mountain. He reported the matter to the local prosecutor's office for investigation. It was confirmed that she had been disfigured and strangled. Li Meiyu was 24 years old, originally from Suzhou, and had received elementary school education. She married Yu five years ago. Due to poverty, she was forced to come to Wuxi as a tour guide. However, the couple's relationship was very close, and Meiyu was frugal, saving a small amount of money, which led to the covetousness of criminals. On the morning of the incident, Meiyu and her husband had a private conversation at the Jinan Hotel. When her husband returned to Suzhou that afternoon, Meiyu had already left, dressed up, and never returned. At the scene where Meiyu was killed, there were two large stones, and the feet of the corpse were in a shallow mud puddle. The surrounding grass was sparse, and the footprints were chaotic, indicating that the deceased had struggled desperately when she was attacked. According to her husband, Yu Baoyi, the deceased was wearing two gold bracelets, two gold rings, a watch, and a full gold lock pendant chain, all of which were stolen. The court has issued an order to the military and police agencies to cooperate in arresting the murderer and bringing him to justice.

### Central Bank Ships Large Amounts of Cash; Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals Lifted; Money Supply Trends Slightly Tight, Bank Branches Show Varied Performances

[Our Dispatch] Previously, the Central Bank, due to a severe shortage of cash in the city, stipulated that withdrawals by financial institutions were limited to one-tenth of their total deposits. This measure was implemented on a trial basis for one day on the 9th, and the results proved to be very difficult in practice. Bank branches found it especially difficult to pay customers. It is now learned that the Central Bank has shipped large amounts of cash, so the restriction on cash withdrawals has been lifted.

It is also reported that the money supply trend was slightly tight yesterday. Although the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury were mostly net debit in the interbank clearing of bills, the Central Bank had a net credit of 365.72 billion, so the average net credit was still 149.03 billion. The Bank of China had a net debit of 57.94 billion, the Bank of Communications had a net debit of 79.79 billion, the Farmers Bank had a net debit of 24.43 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a net debit of 59.81 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau had a net debit of 15.90 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net credit of 21.18 billion, the commercial banks had a large clearing net debit of 19.75 billion, the small clearing net debit of 54.64 billion, and foreign banks had a total net credit of 103.20 billion.

### Rice Prices Rise Sharply; Top Grade White Rice Again Hits a High Price of 50 Million

Rice prices continued to rise, and the increase was stronger than before. As the prices of other commodities had risen far more than rice, public sentiment was already very bullish. Coupled with the strong rise in the tin market, merchants tried hard to increase prices. The morning market saw an increase of 4 to 5 million. Top-grade white rice again hit 50 million, thin paddy rice reached 53 million, and new rice from Pudong also reached as high as 50 million. At the close, as the prices of various external commodities weakened and sentiment turned weaker, the outbound movement was also stagnant. The closing price dropped back by 2 million. Yesterday, the registered arrivals in the North and South markets totaled 6,418 piculs.

Flour

After an initial rise, prices retreated. The morning opening continued the momentum of the previous day's rise, and the market remained firm. Merchants continued to increase prices. The old stock opened at 19 million in the morning market. Later, due to the decline in external grains, the number of deliveries decreased, and the closing price retreated to 18.1 million. The closing price of the "Warship" brand was 17.8 million, an increase of 5 to 6 million compared to the previous day. Bran rose sharply by 1 million. Small bags of bran reached 10 million in the afternoon market. The factory price of wheat opened at 24 million.

Coarse Grains

Prices rose. As the demand from out-of-town buyers remained strong, merchants continued to raise prices. The morning market was firmer, but the closing price also turned softer. Soybeans, favored by out-of-town buyers, increased by 2 million. New soybeans were only sold locally, and the market lacked prosperity. Corn increased by 1 million. Buyers from Shantou have stopped buying Yuanmai, but buyers from the North have not stopped, and prices are still increasing by 1 million. Mung beans and broad beans each increased by 2 million as merchants pushed up prices. Sesame was in short supply. White sesame increased by 4 to 5 million, and Yuanmai increased by nearly 10 million. Raw peanuts were losing momentum among buyers from Guangdong, and prices slightly decreased by 2 million.

Edible Oil

Prices returned to a stable path. Although the opening price in the morning still saw a continued increase, the local market reduced purchases due to high prices. Furthermore, as external commodities generally retreated, individual investors turned bearish and sold off. Soybean oil retreated from 140 million to close at 134 million, a slight decrease of 1 million. Vegetable oil was stable, and sesame oil transactions were dull, with a slight increase of 1 million. Soybean cake transactions were lackluster, and the outbound movement was dull, with a setback of 200,000 to 300,000.

### Strong Buying Interest in Export Tea

The foreign tea market inherited the upward momentum of the previous day. In addition, due to the continued strong buying interest from exporters, the price control was unchecked, and the trend continued to show vitality. Quotations continued to shine brilliantly. However, trading lacked luster due to the scarcity of various goods in stock. It is reported that the Keemun black tea of this year, since the Anhui Tea Company and Zhenhe Tea Firm actively transported it from the production area, will soon arrive in Shanghai. Local tea merchants in this city are also planning to rush the shipment of tea from Wutun and other major brands from the production areas, which is indeed a genuine need.

### Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates Increase Again in Price

[Our Dispatch] The selling price of foreign exchange settlement certificates rose again yesterday. After opening at 6.05 million, it rose in a straight line and exceeded the 7 million mark. Later, as merchants sold off at high prices, it returned to around 6.8 million.

Officials stated that the increase in the price of foreign exchange settlement certificates was due to the large demand from importers and was unrelated to the government. In addition, the recent increase in the price of foreign exchange settlement certificates has also had a considerable stimulating effect on overseas remittances. According to news from the Overseas Chinese Remittance Bureau, the income from overseas remittances in July nearly doubled compared to June.

### Adjustment of Domestic Exchange Rates

The domestic exchange rates of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be adjusted from the 12th as follows: Xiamen 400 yuan, Fuzhou 300 yuan, Quanzhou 400 yuan, Guangzhou 400 yuan, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, and Nanning each 250 yuan, Lianyungang 70 yuan, Xufu and Wanxian each 450 yuan, Nanchang 180 yuan, Jiujiang 180 yuan, Ji'an and Ganzhou each 250 yuan, Haimen and Linhai each 100 yuan, and Yunnan 400 yuan.

### The Discounted Industrial and Mining Advisory Committee Held Its 18th Meeting

[Our Dispatch] The Industrial and Mining Advisory Committee of the Central Bank's Discount Committee held its 18th meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday. More than ten people, including Zhang Zimin, attended the meeting. They discussed three transportation projects, eight public utility projects, three mining projects, six industrial projects, and two temporary proposals. They were rejected or transferred for discounting separately. The Discount Committee will make the final decision next Monday.

### Cotton Prices Rise and Freight Rates Are Expensive; Textile Mills Lack Purchasing Power

It is learned that after Shaanxi cotton was banned from being transported out of the province on July 1 for military use, the government designated the China Textile Corporation and the Cotton Monopoly Council to supply 36,000 dan, and the Farmers Bank to supply 4,000 dan, totaling 40,000 dan. All of these were collected within half a month, so Shaanxi cotton has now been reopened for outward transportation. To date, more than 1,500 tons have been successively shipped out. However, the difficulties encountered after Shaanxi cotton was reopened for outward transportation were more than before.

(1) The selling price of Shaanxi cotton at the end of June was 93 million per dan. After the reopening, the price suddenly soared to 210 million. In addition, the freight from Baoji to Chongqing is 380 million per ton, and the freight from Chongqing to Shanghai is also very high. Thus, after Shaanxi cotton is shipped to Shanghai, its selling price will be more expensive than the price of cotton in Shanghai, which will stimulate the price of cotton in Shanghai. Each textile mill now has no power to sell in.

(2) More than 1,500 tons that were recently shipped to Chongqing were suddenly ordered to be detained by the Chongqing Municipal Government on the grounds that Chongqing lacks cotton. The Shanghai Cotton Industry Association believes that this action by the Chongqing Municipal Government is illegal and has lodged a serious protest with the local government, demanding its return, and hoping that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

(3) The wealthy households in Shaanxi have a large amount of cotton stored, about 200,000 "zu" (a unit of weight, likely local usage) or so, and are unwilling to sell, wanting to save it until the new cotton is purchased in October before selling it. The Shaanxi Provincial Government has no appropriate way to deal with these hoarders. Combining the above practical difficulties, the prospects for Shaanxi cotton being shipped to Shanghai are not optimistic.

In addition, Shaanxi cotton is indeed a bumper year this year, with a total output of up to 1.2 million dan, more than last year. If it can be transported to Shanghai in large quantities, the textile mills will not have to worry about a cotton shortage.

### The Cotton Yarn Market Weakens; Textile Fabrics Are Abundant, and Transactions Turn Lackluster

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was weak. Because the shipping costs were soaring, merchants felt that the prices were too expensive, and demand turned dull. Furthermore, as the financial situation within the industry tightened, speculative longs successively sold off, causing the market to weaken, and sentiment also turned weak.

When the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially opened, it was said that the price of Longtou fine cloth continued to be outstanding, and sentiment was firm, so the asking price was still high. After the opening, as external commodities fell back, there were more sellers in the market. It finally appeared at 2.85 billion for immediate sale, with 80 million left for delivery tomorrow. The closing price was more than 100 million lower than the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarns also declined by 20 to 30 million, or about 10%. One hundred and twenty lots were traded.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was slack due to the tightening of credit in the market and the news that private factories were producing a considerable amount. The supply of goods felt abundant, and police were stationed in the market, so transactions turned scarce.

The 12-pound Longtou fine cloth, in the morning, continued the momentum of the previous day, rising by more than 2 million. As credit was still loose, transactions were booming. The market price rose again to 79.5 million, with transactions. At 10 o'clock, hearing that the stock and yarn markets had fallen sharply, northern merchants suddenly switched to selling, and large investors and speculative longs sold off to take profits. The atmosphere in the market suddenly became thicker. The market abruptly turned weak, closing at 77.5 million, but still increasing by 2.7 million compared to the previous day (1.5 million lower than the external settlement price of the previous day).

It is also reported that the upward momentum strengthened again in the afternoon, and external materials also rose. The asking price for Longtou fine cloth reappeared at the 80 million mark, and again reached a new high of 81 million, 3.5 million higher than the morning settlement price. The Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji also rose by 3.5 million compared to the afternoon closing price.

In addition, the prices of medium-grade fine cloths such as the Five Blessings Loudspeaker were also up by 1.56 million to 2.5 million. Colored cloth and Shilin cloth, stimulated by the increase in dyes, saw an increase of up to 15 million for high-end goods. The market for other cloths was also firm.

It is also reported that the China Textile Corporation yesterday sold seven types of cotton yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee in the cotton yarn market, allowing 31 households to purchase. 124 lots were sold, worth 21,547,000,000. The China Textile Corporation also issued 405 purchase permits yesterday, selling 602 lots of cotton yarn, equivalent to 1377.5 lots of 20-count yarn, worth 151.08 billion yuan.

### This Month's Commodity Tax Increases Sharply; The Total for the Month Could Reach More Than 10 Trillion

According to the person in charge of the Commodity Tax Bureau, commodity tax revenue has greatly improved since the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau strengthened tax collection. The revenue for August, as of yesterday, has reached over 8.4 trillion, an increase of more than 4 trillion compared to the total revenue for the previous month. The cigarette tax alone accounted for approximately 3 trillion, nearly one-third of the total tax revenue. It is expected that the total by the end of the month will reach more than 10 trillion, which will benefit Shanghai's finances. Furthermore, due to the continuous rise in prices, the commodity tax figures for September will be even larger.

It is also reported that according to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, the Direct Commodity and Business Tax Bureau has been merged into the National Tax Bureau. It has now been stipulated by the Ministry of Finance that all expenses and subsidies originally allocated to the Direct Commodity and Business Tax Bureau in each district from July to September of this year may be transferred by each bureau from the amounts that have been allocated but not yet used, by issuing public treasury checks, to the National Tax Bureau in the same area for receipt. The accounts will be established in the name of the National Tax Bureau and continue to be used.

### Cotton Cloth Association Convenes Members' Representative Meeting

The joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Commercial Association resolved to convene the Third Members' Representative Meeting at the Central Vegetable Society on Fuzhou Road on the afternoon of the 28th of this month, to re-elect half of the directors and supervisors and discuss important proposals for the industry. In accordance with the regulations of the Shanghai Social Groups, the preparatory meeting will be convened in advance by district to elect attending representatives. It is scheduled to be held from the 16th to the 23rd of this month, every afternoon at the same location, in the designated geographical districts. It is heard that the total number of member representatives of the association is more than 2,500. According to the regulations promulgated by the Social Bureau, more than 120 attending representatives can be produced. The number of seats is small, and there is no shortage of candidates competing.

### Relaxing the Scale of Overseas Chinese Investment; The Import-Export Management Committee Suggests Two Points

[Our Dispatch] According to the Import-Export Management Committee, since the promulgation of the Measures to Encourage Overseas Chinese Investment, the government has solicited opinions from the industrial and commercial sectors. It is now learned that the Import-Export Management Committee has submitted two proposed revisions based on the application of the industrial sector and requested approval from the Executive Yuan.

The revised measures are: (1) The raw materials allowed to be imported by overseas Chinese investment must be coordinated with the needs of domestic manufacturers, that is, domestic production institutions may directly enter into contracts with overseas Chinese investors, and with the permission of the competent authorities, directly transport the raw materials to domestic production enterprises so that supply and demand are coordinated.

(2) For cases where the raw materials and national currency funds imported by overseas Chinese investment are used to establish new factories, in consideration of the actual situation, the time limit will be extended from six months to one year. The relaxation of the scale of returning overseas Chinese investment can increase the supply of domestic materials and achieve the goal of encouraging production.

### National Medicines Rise

Recently, due to exchange rate issues, costs have been significantly affected. Market prices have uniformly risen. Cardamom of various grades has risen sharply. Superior grade cardamom is 14 million, Grade 1 selected cardamom is 10 million, Grade 2 selected cardamom is 9 million, top purple cardamom is 7.5 million, and raw cardamom is 6 million. Golden seal Zhuye is 42 million, three-top is 38 million, double-top is 24 million, top-grade blood amber is 16 million, and upper blood amber is 6 million. Qingjiapian is 4.8 million, Dongshaoyao king is 10 million to 6 million, Xuanhu is 4 million to 1.6 million, and Jingheche (likely referring to placenta) is opening at 300,000, all creating unprecedented new highs.

### Local Business Conditions

Gold ornaments went in at 500 million and out at 540 million.

### Weakness Mid-Course, Chinese Stocks Recovered at Close

Chinese stocks were initially weak but later strong yesterday. Concerns were widespread, causing yarn and cloth to decline in the morning market. The drop intensified near noon, especially affecting smaller stocks. Hong Kong Telecom shares reached new lows, completely changing the outlook. However, they recovered at the close, with stocks like China Flour Mill (華豐) hitting the upper limit.

In the morning, inheriting the previous day's momentum and fueled by rumors of large-scale capital inflows, the market opened relatively flat. Wing On Textiles (永紗) started at $156,50 yuan, while most smaller stocks opened lower. As flexible deposit measures failed to materialize and negotiations for U.S. loans intensified, shares of stocks like No. 152, No. 179, No. 176, No. 22, No. 102, and No. 76 were sold down to $153,50 yuan. Stocks like No. 141, No. 220, No. 45, No. 12, No. 65, No. 205, No. 224, No. 60, No. 54, and No. 207 still attracted buyers, pushing the price to a new high of $159,50 yuan. Trading in yarn and cloth started normally, with stocks like No. 154, No. 226, No. 71, No. 153, No. 176, No. 137, No. 152, No. 129, No. 207, and No. 76 being settled, gradually declining. Stocks like No. 206, No. 156, No. 224, No. 14, No. 102, No. 116, and No. 152 were sold down to $151,50 yuan, with No. 151, No. 54, No. 76, and No. 95 being bought back, rising to $154,00 yuan. The price of yarn and cloth fell significantly, causing widespread panic due to large inventories. It was anticipated that the National Bank would intervene further. Stocks like No. 152, No. 23, No. 61, No. 98, No. 89, No. 119, No. 203, No. 60, and No. 226 were sold down to $149,70 yuan, while No. 143, No. 179, and No. 160 were maintained. Rumors spread of Hong Kong Telecom shrinking and exchange settlement certificates rising. The midday close was $151,20 yuan. King Fook (景福) struggled to sell stock No. 220 due to the power of Hing Yip (興業), further weakening the market. Smaller stocks inevitably became more fragile. Ultimately, Tung Yih (統益) was the only one to close at the upper limit. Wu Foo (五和) Match and China United Chemical Industries (華新) rose slightly, while Commercial Press (商務) remained flat. New Kwong (新光), Tung Hing (動興), and Chapei (閘北) fell by 10%, while others suffered smaller declines ranging up to 5%.

In the afternoon market, Wing On Textiles opened at $154,50 yuan. Although stocks like No. 114, No. 185, and No. 131 were offered, Hong Kong Telecom shares reached a new low of $0.05. Stocks like No. 16, No. 137, No. 65, No. 224, No. 192, No. 129, No. 97, No. 4, No. 117, No. 225, No. 206, No. 220, No. 207, No. 190, No. 3, and No. 169 were actively bought. Despite a slight retracement mid-course and the National Bank's intervention, external stimulus suddenly arose. With the strong buying of No. 169 and No. 190, Wing On Textiles rose to close at $163,20 yuan. China Corporation (華曁) was aggressively purchased from No. 107, attracting many followers and soaring to the upper limit. Other stocks also saw gains, with Tung Yih and Union Land (聯地) closing at the upper limit. Compared to the morning close, besides the three stocks closing at the upper limit, Sin Yih (信誼), Dah Chong (大通), and Wu Foo did not open. Mei Lin (梅林) and Wing Kung (永公) rose slightly, while Wing Feng (榮豐) and Banque Franco-Chinoise (中法) rose by 5%. The remaining stocks generally increased by 0.5% to 1%.

Government Bonds

Yesterday's trading was in a stalemate. The morning opening for Unified C (統丙) was 1.83 million, rising to 1.86 million before falling back to 1.75 million. A slight rise was seen near the close, but the fluctuations were narrow, and trading volume was very low. Room 500 and Cheng Teh (承德) sold, while Room 552 and Room 503 bought. As a result, compared to the previous close, A, B, and D grades were flat, while C and E grades were slightly down by 10,000 yuan.

Stock Exchange

The stock exchange announced yesterday that, effective immediately, market trading hours would be from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM and from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM. There would be no afternoon session on Saturdays.

### Commercial Briefs

The silk market initially rose but then softened. Initially, due to the sharp rise in silk prices, the market continued the overnight gains and saw further upward momentum. Ta Cheng (大誠) crepe once reached 1.8 billion yuan, but ultimately closed at 1,775 million yuan, a gain of 11 million yuan. Over-the-counter bidding remained small.

The sugar market rose and then slightly declined. Initially, news of the Taiwan dollar rising again boosted confidence, and the market continued the previous night's gains, rising further. Later, due to reports of falling prices in the North Market, selling increased, and the market declined. Chang Paiqing (章白情) and the sugar guild formed a combined position, with both doing 73.8 million yuan tomorrow. Native sugar prices continued to rise.

Mineral oil prices have stabilized, with the overall market price lower than the bank price. For example, Mobil motor oil is sold by banks for over 500 million yuan, while the market price is only 420 million yuan. Gasoline in drums can be purchased for 3.5 million yuan per gallon, but some retailers still ask for 4 million yuan.

As the price difference between the production price and the Shanghai market for asphalt is very small, not many goods are arriving from the source. Local soap factories and candle manufacturers are repeatedly making inquiries, with soap factories accounting for the larger demand. The seventh lunar month is usually the peak season for candle manufacturing, but due to weak purchasing power and high surcharges, sales are not as high as last year. Ho Pen (禾本) is asking for 220 million yuan, while plain oil (平油) and orchid oil (蘭油), the high-end goods, also require 200 million to 210 million yuan.

Singapore coconut oil, with its cost of arrival (based on Hong Kong prices plus tax) higher than the market price, and the constant demand from soap factories, the market conditions are firm. Yesterday's market was still asking for 280 million yuan, with traders doing 270 million yuan. Butter arrivals were few, and transactions were not active.

Fluorescent lamps are in high demand due to the high prices of gold and banknotes on the black market, leading to bullish sentiment. A 48-inch General Electric blue fluorescent tube has risen to 27.5 million yuan per tube. Similarly, Sylvania has risen to 22 million yuan, with a general increase of 10% to 20%.

Due to the uncertainty regarding the delivery schedule of Wing Tai Wo (永泰和) cigarettes, retail sales are good. Various factories are not calculating costs, and with the hype from racketeers, market prices have risen again. Ten Great Britain cigarettes are now priced at 8.8 million yuan.

Soap prices have also been boosted by the soaring cigarette prices. In addition, rising raw material costs mean that various factories are not calculating costs. A transaction for Gu Ben (固本) soap was made at 76 million yuan, and there were buyers for Henry soap at 61 million yuan.

Although sales of building materials remain weak, sentiment has gradually turned firm. Large blue bricks are still priced at 520 million yuan, requiring extra cartage fees. Cement prices in the market have also firmed up, with transactions at 9 million yuan per bag plus 400,000 yuan cartage fees. Some are asking 100 million yuan for felt, but the actual market price is between 85 million and 90 million yuan.

### Our Basketball Team Defeats Great Britain by a Landslide, Today's Final Against Italy, Wonderful Coordination with Constant Applause

[Reported by this Newspaper] London, 11th Broadcasting: The Chinese basketball team recently defeated the British team 54-25 in the third-tier qualifying round, and will compete with the Italian team, which defeated Egypt, in the final on Thursday for 17th place.

China consistently fielded its starting five of Bao Songyuan (包松圓), Huang Tianxi (黃天錫), Zang Wenhua (葬文華), Li Shiqiao (李世僑), and Wu Chengzhang (吳成章). The British players were physically imposing, but their skills were mediocre. The Chinese team controlled the entire game, consistently taking the lead. In the first half, they won by nine points with a score of 23-14 with a light touch. After switching sides, the Chinese team remained unchanged, while the British frequently substituted players, attempting to curb the Chinese team's momentum. However, Wenhua's mid-range shooting, Chengzhang's corner turnaround shots, and Songyuan's layups were unstoppable by the British players. At 36-17, the British team missed a free throw. Songyuan intercepted the ball under the basket and quickly passed it to Wenhua. Wenhua passed it to Shiqiao, who feinted a shot. The British player jumped to block, and Shiqiao cleverly passed it back to Wenhua, who made an open shot. The wonderful coordination earned a full house of applause. The cheering had not yet stopped when the British center scored a layup. Shiqiao returned the favor. The British team launched a full-scale attack, but their shooting was inaccurate and repeatedly missed good opportunities, giving Songyuan the opportunity to shine under the basket. Afterwards, Chengzhang made three out of three shots, and Wenhua and Songyuan also scored. The British team only made two out of two throws, scoring six points. At the end of the game, China won by a landslide with a score of 54-25.

[Reported by this Newspaper] London, 11th Broadcasting: In the football semi-final, Sweden defeated the Danish team 4-2 in front of nearly 10,000 cheering and boisterous spectators, and will compete for the championship against the winner of the Great Britain vs. Yugoslavia match on the 12th evening. Denmark will compete against the loser of the Great Britain vs. Yugoslavia match on the same afternoon for third and fourth place.

This is the first time the Swedish football team has reached the final week since participating in the World Games. The Swedish team's skillful coordination and lightning-fast attack methods are unmatched by professional football teams in Great Britain, the birthplace of football. Although the Danish team suffered a setback, their front line is also formidable. The Swedish defense is extremely strong. Before this game, they had not conceded a goal in two consecutive matches. However, two minutes into the game, the Danish left winger Spacchi (史巴治) scored a goal. Sweden equalized the score in the 15th minute and then scored three more goals, taking a 4-1 lead in the first half. In the second half, Sweden's attack was still strong, but Danish goalkeeper Nielsen (尼爾遜) performed brilliantly, saving the situation and preventing any further losses. In the 31st minute, Danish left forward Halzen (哈爾遜) powerfully kicked the ball from 20 yards out, hitting the crossbar and going into the net, making the score 2-4. After that, the two Swedish fullbacks returned to defend, and Denmark's strong attack was ineffective, and they were eliminated by Sweden.

### Poems and Praises, Horns Sound Together, A Record of the Opening of the Olympic Games, Great and Warm Opening with Unprecedented Grandeur

—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zhong Zhen (鐘震)

[Airlifted Dispatch from London, for This Newspaper] July 29th—In the eyes of Londoners, it is indeed an extraordinary day, because since the destruction of the Second World War, London has been greatly damaged and has always been in a state of depression. The World Games, the first global peace event, can be held in London, undoubtedly giving this declining metropolis an opportunity to prosper.

Since the end of June, the weather in Europe has been extremely abnormal, with summer behaving like winter, and continuous cloudy and rainy days, a record not seen since 1919. Therefore, many people worry that it will affect the once-in-a-millennium World Games. However, since the 24th of this month, the low pressure seems to have been driven away by the enthusiastic emotions of the citizens. The mercury column has risen sharply to more than 90 degrees, and the clear sky and hot sun show the original appearance of summer.

Thousands of Heads Moving

The long-awaited 14th Olympic Games finally opened grandly at the Wembley Royal Stadium in southern London, England, this afternoon (July 29) under the auspices of the King of England. Since 12:00 noon, the subway and public buses from the city center to Wembley Park have added shifts, but proportionally, they still cannot catch up with the number of spectators. According to reports, the statistics of tickets sold three days before the opening exceeded 64,000, and the entire stadium can only accommodate a maximum of 82,000 people. After 1:00 PM, the roads from the Wembley Public Underground Station to the stadium were already crowded with people, and the parking lot announced that it was full. Spectators gathered in front of the stadium, the Imperial Swimming Pool, the Engineering Palace, and the BBC Broadcasting Company, waiting to enter the venue. The typical London police officers, riding tall horses, were dispatched to maintain order. The reporter looked down at the crowd from the press office in the community meeting place, like a hundred-section long snake wriggling. Tens of thousands of spectators crowded in the hot sun, and were very excited. The five-ring Olympic flag was flying along the way, and vendors selling program sheets and souvenirs shouted desperately to sell the goods in their hands. Two hours later, the stands around the venue were already full of people. The flags of the participating countries fluttered in the wind around the stands. On a huge scoreboard in the middle of the venue, it was written: "In the Olympic Games, the most important thing is not to achieve victory, but to seek talent, not to be able to defeat others, but to strive for the competition." Facing the royal box—the command platform—on the stands, was a choir of hundreds of people in white clothes, and a royal guard band of more than a hundred people in bright red uniforms, black pants, and black hats. The movie camera was placed at a high place, and more than 80,000 spectators were waiting intently for the opening ceremony to be held.

The Emperor Arrives

At 2:25 PM, a British Cavalry Music Team entered the venue and stood in front of the royal box, blowing a majestic horn sound. Dozens of members of the International Olympic Committee and the entire 14th Olympic Committee, wearing formal clothes, entered in an orderly manner and stood in a line in front of the royal box, quietly waiting for the arrival of the British royal family. At 2:30 PM, with the resounding sound of music, King George VI of England, wearing a sky-blue admiral's uniform, accompanied by the Queen and Princess Margaret, went to the ranks of the committee members, and a cry of "Long live" came from the stands. Immediately, the president of the Olympic Committee introduced all the members to the King of England. Under the guidance of Edstrom (艾德斯托姆), president of the International Olympic Committee, and Sir Burt (卜爾托), president of this conference, he entered the royal box seat. All the spectators stood up and played the British national anthem.

Athletes Parade

After that, the band played marches. In the cadence of the music, 6,000 athletes from 59 countries entered the venue. The Greek team took the lead, followed by a Boy Scout holding a wooden sign with the words of each country written on it, followed by athletes holding the national flag. All the Greek athletes were wearing gray uniforms and white shoes. Because they were the first team, they attracted the attention of the audience. Then, they were arranged in alphabetical order according to the English spelling, so the next were the Afghan athletes wearing dark green uniforms and Turkish hats. The uniforms of the athletes of various countries were the most noticeable. The red shirts and white pants of the Danish athletes, and the white French hats worn by the female athletes, echoed the red bottom and white cross of the Danish flag in front of the team, making them even more colorful and extraordinary. There were more than 50 representatives from our country, wearing blue uniforms, white trousers, white shirts, purple-red ties, and black leather shoes, looking energetic and earning a lot of applause.

Announcing the Opening

The long procession of 6,000 people was completed in one hour and five minutes. The chairman of the conference then gave the opening speech, the content of which was: reporting the process of deciding to hold this conference in London, and hoping that the young people who came from every corner of the world from the 50+ participating countries would build up a spirit of friendship with each other. He also said: The 4th Olympic Games in 1908 were also held here forty years ago. At that time, the host was the father of the country, George V, and now the ceremony is hosted by King George VI, etc. After the speech, the Emperor read the opening remarks in front of the broadcasting machine and celebrated the conference's ability to be held on schedule. The sound of "Long live" rose again. In the sound of music and horns, the colorful five-ring Olympic flag slowly rose. The wicker baskets of the Boy Scouts next to the runway were suddenly opened high. 7,000 pigeons flapped their wings and soared. For a time, the sky was full of white pigeons, and the choir sang the Olympic hymn. Several planes circled in the low air above the venue. A 21-gun salute was fired. At 4:07 PM, the torch arrived. John Mack (約翰馬克), who was only 23 years old, carried the torch, which had been burning for 12 days, and brought it from the ancient Olympic temple in Greece, and rushed in. Under the sunlight, it was extremely beautiful. After circling the venue, he ran to the top of the gate and lit it in the white marble pillar. After that, the leaders of the US delegation and athletes from all countries declared: "We swear that we will faithfully participate in the Olympic competition, abide by all the rules of the conference, value sportsmanship and spirit, and win glory for sports." At this time, the choir's singing began again, and the audience cheered and applauded, with a sound that reached the sky, and the crowds reached a frenzy. Finally, with the march being played, each athlete team retired, and the opening ceremony was completed. In the next fourteen days, a heart-pounding competition will be held in 21 places such as the Haringey Drum Competition Venue, Dulwich, and Chiswick Park in London. 200,000 spectators who came to London are eagerly awaiting the brilliant record.

### Northeast Universities Relocating to Beiping: Ministry Approves Independent Operations; Classes to Commence Separately Upon Confirmation of School Sites; Private School Students Must Await Placement Exams

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] The Ministry of Education issued a clear order on the 9th for all national universities in the Northeast to relocate to Beiping, and approved their independent operations. This outcome has satisfied various parties, bringing higher education in the Northeast back on track. The Ministry’s telegram to those in charge of the universities stated: “The four national universities relocating to Beiping—Dongbei University, Shenyang Medical College, Changbai Normal College, and Changchun Institute of Technology—will remain under the responsibility of their respective leadership. The task of the Provisional University is to assist with school site selection and to register and assist in distributing the students who have already arrived in Beiping for temporary study. If the original universities decide to relocate to Beiping, and have personnel responsible for all matters, they should immediately be transferred to the original universities for independent operation.” Regarding students from unaccredited schools, the Ministry further instructed: "Those who have arrived in Beiping but have not yet obtained student status should be placed in supplementary classes for registration and review. During the supplementary period, the four universities, in conjunction with the supplementary classes, will conduct entrance and placement exams. Students who pass will be assigned to the appropriate grade, and their past academic records and grades from private schools will be given special recognition.” According to this order, Dongbei University and Changbai Normal College, having already assembled their faculty and students, can separate from the Provisional University as soon as school sites are allocated, and formally commence classes by the end of September.

### On Relief Efforts for Students Fleeing Henan and Shandong to Beijing: Ministry of Education Issues Statement; Hopes They Maintain Resolve, Uphold Order; Educational Placement Problem Being Properly Planned and Resolved

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The Ministry of Education spokesman issued the following statement on the 11th regarding the relief efforts for students fleeing Henan and Shandong: “Since the communist bandits in Henan and Shandong have expanded their rebellion, the suppression of the insurgency has intensified. Students in the bandit-controlled areas, unwilling to be coerced, have fled south in droves. Their resolve and experiences are truly pitiable. The Ministry began relief efforts and educational guidance as early as when Bianyuan fell to the bandits. However, the academic qualifications and status of the students arriving in Beijing vary. While temporary relief can be provided uniformly, educational placement must be handled based on individual circumstances. Since February, relevant departments within the Ministry have been constantly deliberating on relief and guidance measures, and implementing them promptly. In conjunction with relevant agencies in the capital, temporary relief efforts have been widely conducted without interruption. The Ministry's Guidance Committee work teams are also providing care and accommodation in various locations. It is estimated that over 13,000 students from Henan, Shandong, and central Jiangsu have arrived in Beijing. Among those who arrived earlier and have verified student status, over 3,500 have been registered into Provisional Middle Schools and Summer Camps. Over 9,000 with unclear student status, and those who arrived later, have been accommodated in over 20 elementary and secondary schools in Beijing for relief, and efforts are underway to facilitate their resumption of studies. Most students arriving in Beijing have been able to maintain order, self-respect, and self-discipline. However, a small number of students have made unreasonable demands, gathered crowds to pressure authorities, such as the 200-plus graduating middle school students demanding unconditional placement in national universities on July 8. On August 1, over 200 middle school graduates from before 1947 demanded guaranteed admission to universities. On August 9, over 100 students from the unaccredited private Zhongyuan Institute of Technology demanded exemption from entrance exams for transfer to universities. On August 10, over 1,000 middle school students who recently arrived in Beijing demanded immediate admission to schools and increased food allowances, all of which are noteworthy. They have even blocked traffic and occupied public offices, escalating their actions to an unacceptable level, which is deeply regrettable! The Ministry is mindful of the students' plight and has repeatedly listened to their petitions. Relevant officials have explained the situation repeatedly and patiently. Fortunately, no major incidents have occurred. However, the situation is volatile, and the communist bandits are seizing opportunities to harm young people. A slight misstep could have dire consequences. It is hoped that students arriving in Beijing will maintain their firm resolve, exercise reason, uphold order, and avoid acting rashly or giving up on themselves. Regarding the issue of education, the Ministry has devised appropriate placement methods based on individual circumstances and has convened the heads of the Shandong and Henan education departments, and the principals of middle schools in the Southwest and eastern Henan in Beijing to discuss school restoration."

### Education Ministry Invites Governors of Suiyuan Districts to Beijing to Discuss Educational Issues

The Ministry has formulated a plan for discussion at the meeting.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] In order to discuss the many pressing educational issues in the pacification zones, the Ministry of Education has drafted a comprehensive educational plan and has telegraphed the education commissioners of relevant provinces to come to Beijing for a meeting. It is reported that Li Taihua, the education commissioner of Shandong, has already arrived in Beijing, and the education commissioners of Hubei, Rehe, and Henan provinces will also attend the meeting.

### Education Bureau Schedules Tuition Fee Discussion Meeting for the Day After Tomorrow

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Education Bureau is scheduled to hold a symposium on the issue of tuition fees for all municipal public and private universities, middle, and elementary schools for the upcoming semester this Saturday (the 14th) at 3:00 PM at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road. Zhu Jingnong, Gu Shusen, municipal councilors, university professors, representatives of public and private middle and elementary school principals and teachers, and chairpersons of parent-teacher associations from various schools will be invited to attend and jointly discuss the method of collecting tuition fees for the next semester and a reasonable amount to enable schools to maintain their expenditures while considering the burden on parents. This will serve as a basis and reference for the municipal government to set a unified standard.

### Nanchang and Shanghai

— Ping Zhai

Mayor Wu is a good official. He has the courage, the passion, and, most admirably, the gift of eloquence, making him one of the best in the country.

With this unprecedented surge in public utility prices, Mayor Wu naturally had to say a few words.

However, Mayor Wu, in addition to reiterating yesterday (August 9) the old refrain that "the surge in public utility prices is beyond the control of the municipal government," cited a rather unusual example. He stated that, to his knowledge, "public utility prices in Nanchang are 500 million times higher than in Shanghai, yet the people do not complain."

Why do the citizens of Nanchang possess the manners of the Gentleman's Country in the novel "Flowers in the Mirror," able to understand and embrace difficulties so deeply? According to Mayor Wu's explanation, "Because the Nanchang public utility company was forced to shut down electricity and water due to financial difficulties, causing immense hardship to the people, they were left with no choice but to pay exorbitant prices to have the services continue."

Mayor Wu's intention in citing this example is clear: (1) Public utility prices in Shanghai are still cheap, so don't make a fuss; (2) Public utility prices are non-negotiable. If you want water and electricity, you'll just have to bite the bullet and "bear" it, or else be prepared for an abrupt shutdown of services. Why wait until you are in "immense hardship" before "reluctantly paying exorbitant prices to have the services continue," ending up "being forced to eat a fine when you refuse a treat?"

The example cited by Mayor Wu is, of course, factual. Crows of the world are all black. Under the management of incompetent officials, it is also factual that public utility companies readily threaten the people with water and electricity shutdowns to force them to pay exorbitant prices. The people, unable to obtain support from the local government and with water and electricity being essential for life, have no choice but to endure and submit under these circumstances. This is also, of course, factual.

In Mayor Wu's words, only the phrases "the people do not complain" and the subsequent "reluctantly" seem somewhat contradictory—perhaps a kind of "reluctant" "without complaint"—but it sounds a bit odd. However, this is a minor detail and need not be dwelt upon.

However, when Mayor Wu made the above statement, I wonder if he had seen that day's (August 9) edition of this newspaper. On page 2 of that day's paper, there was a filler news item, a brief special dispatch from Fanyang dated the 7th, stating: "Changchun Mayor Shang Chuandao telegraphed here, saying that the price of sorghum rice in Changchun has reached 10 million legal tender per catty. Citizens are buying rice by the ounce. This is unprecedented. 500 million yuan banknotes are circulating in the market."

If, in a few days, the price of rice in Shanghai fluctuates again, I wonder if Mayor Wu will also compare it and say, "The price of rice in Changchun is ×× times higher than in Shanghai, yet the people can still survive buying rice by the ounce"?

If you say that Changchun is Changchun, and Shanghai is Shanghai, and they cannot be compared, then is Nanchang Shanghai?

I still clearly remember Mayor Wu's inaugural speech at the Tsinghua Alumni Association. He said that to stabilize prices, he was determined to crack down on unscrupulous merchants, "even if it means offending many people." He also urged workers to be open and cooperative with employers, and not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. However, since public utility expenses are closely related to the cost of living index, how can industry and commerce avoid becoming the "goose to be killed" sooner or later when this price increase stimulates the index, and the index then stimulates prices? Mayor Wu should really summon the courage to "offend people" and save these sickly, emaciated geese gasping for breath.

The example of Nanchang is frightening; however, what is frightening is not so much the profit-seeking Nanchang public utility company, but the Nanchang local authorities who disregard the people's survival—so incompetent, so cowardly, so callous!

### Fear

— Shi Yu

Worry creates fear, and fear creates misfortune. Walking on a narrow wooden plank suspended in the air, the more fearful you are, the easier it is to fall; the less fearful you are, the safer you can cross. Such is life. Such is practical politics.

To put it in a nutshell: the authorities' "announcement of the birth of 5 million dollar notes" is a sign of fear; saying that the large notes affect prices is a "psychological illusion" of the people is also a sign of fear. As Shaw said: "A mousetrap can catch mice. But it is a bit hard to imagine a mousetrap chasing mice!" The relationship between large notes and prices is not more complex than cross-country running. Therefore, it is best if large notes are issued secretly, but this could not be done, so even "larger" notes were announced in advance to reduce "stimulation." This "stimulation" is no longer a stimulation of prices, but a stimulation of people's senses. Because in reality, when "large" notes are officially issued, prices will still catch up.

Therefore, the authorities are issuing large notes in a state of anxious glances. Someone who is extremely afraid "thinks" of learning to swim in winter and ice skating in summer, but cannot get his wish, which is quite pitiful. The origin of fear, to put it more primitively, is the animal's use of it to protect its life in danger. The adrenal glands increase secretion, the heart beats rapidly, blood flow is frequent, and muscles twitch. Many animals attack in this state. Often, to protect a part of the danger, the whole is neglected. Old eagles often use the attack-like terror of small streams to capture it. Snakes are also like this.

Fear is not typhoid, but it is contagious. Walt Disney often tells us in his cartoons stories like this: One deer is afraid and runs away first, and the herd of deer follows. If the leader falls into a valley and dies, the herd of deer will also fall into the valley and die. If a house catches fire, the elder runs away, and the whole family runs away. Social psychologists say that obedience to orders is based on fear. If the issuance of orders is also based on fear, then it is very sad. It only makes the concept of fear expand day by day, thus creating the panic of today.

It is said that ideal politics is based on "love." This "love," in the current situation, may have to refer to Romantic Love! That is, the object of love must be regarded as very difficult to possess and very precious, so one must do everything possible to win the love of this object. Whether using poems or songs, or even a Spanish Guitar, is perfectly fine, as long as you are sincere and confident when you strum the strings. But if you tremble to ask for love, you can forget about winning the hearts of girls.

I am not an economist. But I believe that no economist can completely transform the current economic situation, just as a surgeon cannot reconstruct the organization of a person's life. But if the authorities can take stable strides with confidence, perhaps it will be beneficial to the stability of the entire economy.

The Leaning Tower of Pisa began to tilt in the eighteenth century. If everyone was afraid of its collapse, perhaps it would have been rebuilt long ago. The influence of psychology on the "human body" is often so amazing.

### Talking about Choice

— Jin Jin

Heaven endows people with the ability to choose. If they can use it well, they will be blessed on all sides and benefit immensely. Confucius advocated "do not befriend those who are not as good as yourself," while the contemporary American writer John Dos Passos (according to recent news, this gentleman was in a car accident some time ago, his wife died, and he himself lost an eye) wrote about a courtesan who, when she first went to Hollywood, always hung out with extras and minor characters, thinking that it was meaningless. An American celebrity also said that if you want to get rich, you must hang out with rich people. Although this is an extreme statement based on the vicissitudes of the world, it can be seen that if an individual wants to achieve success, he must be careful in choosing friends.

In fact, in our daily lives, if we can spend more time choosing, we will surely reap more rewards. When purchasing any supplies, if we can carefully choose in advance, the coffee we buy will not be moldy, the sleeves of the shirt will not be too large, and there will be no small holes in the fabric that have been repaired. Even when taking a rickshaw, if you can choose a young and strong rickshaw puller, pulling a rickshaw with a snow-white cushion, clean armrests, and a blanket to pad your feet, he will not only run like the wind, but your white shirt or blouse worn in summer, when placed on the rickshaw bar, will also be free from dust or rust.

The essence of Darwin's theory of evolution is that things compete and nature selects, and the fittest survive. The so-called natural selection is, after all, a very abstract thing. In reality, it is the individuals in the same society who are choosing. If the selection is stricter, there will be more elimination, and the progress of society will be faster, although from an emotional point of view, it is inevitably a little cruel for those who are outdated to be exhausted and fail.

### The Art Black Market in Paris

— Ru Shi

Europe is currently experiencing a new "art renaissance." The prices of works of art are soaring day by day—but the people who collect these works of art are no longer the wealthy gentlemen of the past. Today, the customers who buy paintings are indeed paying unprecedentedly high prices, spending a fortune without hesitation; but the source of their money is hoarding, black market operations, or large-scale smuggling.

They are not just being cultured; they just want to buy low and sell high, and make another profitable business from these works of art. Works of art themselves have also created a black market. Cities such as Marseille and Naples are distribution centers for black market works of art. However, the most important activity center is of course Paris.

There are indeed many people in Paris who have made a fortune from "national disaster" and "victory." The source of their assets is mostly inscrutable, but in order to facilitate private transactions, most of the banknotes they hold are large notes with a face value of 5,000 francs. Recently, in order to crack down on these profiteers, the National Bank of France suddenly announced that all people holding large notes with a face value of 5,000 francs must exchange them for small notes at the bank within 72 hours. After this time, these large notes would be invalid. This, of course, shocked those nouveau riche profiteers, but they thought of a clever plan: buy paintings.

They bought many famous paintings at extremely high prices, paying entirely with large notes with a face value of 5,000 francs. It is naturally no problem for the people who sold the paintings to take these large notes to exchange for small notes. Their large notes came from legitimate transactions, and those nouveau riche profiteers had already happily cleared out these large notes. The people who sold the paintings were certainly not fools, and they took this opportunity to reap a huge profit. One person sold a batch of paintings within 24 hours of the deadline, receiving large notes worth a total of 10 million francs, and the amount he earned purely from this 10 million francs was more than 7 million francs.

One person, who was a tailor before the war, met a customer who specialized in collecting famous paintings, who owed him money. That customer sent him a few paintings as compensation. Unexpectedly, this tailor was very good at doing business, and he started from these few paintings, and things went smoothly. Now he has built a first-class gallery in Paris.

When the German army occupied France, many French painters fled to the Vichy region, which was not occupied by the German army. At that time, foreign exchange was cut off, and there was simply no way out for their works. In order to eat and clothe themselves, they had to sell these works cheaply. At that time, several far-sighted art dealers took the opportunity to buy them in large quantities, and today they have become extremely popular dealers in the Paris art market.

The people who are active in the "art black market" in Paris are not necessarily all ruthless guys who only know how to make money. One person who used to work in a bank said, "Look at the situation in Europe, no one knows what will happen in the end. If a war breaks out, what if the franc is worthless? Of course, you should buy more things with real value. Buying paintings is best. If there is any sign of trouble, you can just take out the painting frame, roll it up, and run away."

In this kind of transaction, American soldiers are also not lagging behind. An American soldier stationed in Berlin exchanged three cartons of cigarettes for a good painting. When he got to Paris, he sold it for 300,000 francs, but he didn't know that the painting had risen to 700,000 francs in the blink of an eye.

The most popular items in the "art black market" are the works of new painters. The most fashionable painters are Modigliani, Picasso, Matisse, Utrillo, and Braque. However, these painters are now not very enthusiastic about painting. Although Picasso has painted a lot, he rarely sells them. He knows the principle that scarcity makes things valuable. At this time of soaring prices, he really does not want to produce too much, so as not to cause a price drop.
